5,GREAT product!,"This particular clipper was recommended to me by a vet tech who has groomed hundreds of horses, goats, and dogs. I needed a sturdy pair of clippers to keep my two elderly dogs shaved down short as trips to the groomer were stressful for them, and they no longer tolerated brushing of any kind. No reflection on my wonderful groomer-my girls were just too old and had too many health issues to travel and be in different surroundings comfortably. These clippers did the trick! I can quickly and safely keep them shaved short. They are easy and comfortable to use and get rid of the dogs' incredibly thick double coats quickly. The cord is nice and long for dog grooming. The girls stay in their familiar surroundings, are much less stressed, and it's a win-win for all."
1,beware!,"If you are serious about finding help for someone you love, read this book. Then throw it in the trash and find another one that offers valuable information which can help save the life of a family member. While this book seems to offer that very hope, in reality what it offers is perspective from an uneducated, ex convict, ditch digger. Exactly the type person I'd like to help me make life altering decisions. Do yourself a favor, and seek PROFESSIONAL help. You would never seek medical advice from a skid row bum, so why would you look for help for mental problems from an unqualified, unskilled, uneducated mental hospital escapee? The point is while enticing and inviting, reading this book and subsequently contacting one of his programs for help will only be the beginning of a long road that will lead basically right where you started from only you will be older and with less money."
1,The only reason I even gave this book 1 star is...,"Because it is written slightly better than his other worthless book ""Bumper Stickers."" In BTYBR, you will discover that Bob truly finds himself as the second coming, and truly believes that he may have actually invented fun.My advice to anyone thinking of buying this book is to slowly turn around, then run like hell. In the long run Bob's programs do nothing but harm kids and their families. I know, I was personally involved in the program for over 4 years, and worked at the place for 2.Go spend your money on something worthwhile, like a frappachino. A frappachino will do your family more good than this book."
2,Great tool for brainwashing scared parents,"Bob Meehan is a cult leader. I know this because I was partof this cult for 3 years in Atlanta GA. He has branches in AZ, CO, MO, GA, and probably more since I escaped.The book is one of the many pieces of literature parents are urged to purchase when they enroll their kids into this group. Little do they know at the time they are putting kids (usually without a real drug problem) into a cult.Stay away from this book and anything endorsed or written by Bob Meehan. I lost most of my youth to this cult and would hate to see anyone else fall under his spell."
5,Helped me and my family a lot!!!!,"This book has helped me tremendously. I first read this book when I joined an enthusiastic recovery program in St. Louis, Mo. It was the first thing that I read and was able to relate to. It gave me a really cool perspective on sobriety. My mom also got rocked by the book. All of this helped her and me, which has ultimately helped me to stay sober and have a lot of fun doing so."
1,Please don't waste your money,"I went through one of Bob's programs. I devoted 2 1/2 years of my life there. I was an alcoholic in desperate need of help. Walking into the group seemed like the answer but I've spent the last few years recovering from the Meehan experience. Bob is a sick man, with sick motives. He is not qualified to tell anyone how to get children sober. He is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. He will drain your pocketbooks and dismantle your family with his ""tools of recovery"". He is a cult leader. If you or someone you love is in the program, get out!!!"
1,Concerned mother about Cornerstone,"My son just joined a Cornerstone Recovery group in Texas. What connection does Meehan have with Cornerstone? These are scarey reviews on his book. I know Cornerstone recommends reading his book. What are they doing to these kids that make it sound like a cult? He does seem to not want to do drugs another;however, I don't want him to trade one addiction for another. Concerned Mom..."
1,Please read this before wasting $20.00.,"I could go on and on about what a horrible human being Bob Meehan is. Or, I could just tell you to go to youtube and do a search on him.1.You will find his interesting views on rape.2.You will find him telling a bulimic girl how fat people are pieces of s***3.You will find him insulting disabled people4.You will find him calling African-Americans the N word.This is all Bob Meehan. This is the man who wrote this book.Bob Meehan, is the last person I would turn to if I had a child with a drug or alcohol addiction."
1,Bob Meehan is a Cult Leader,"Bob Meehan is a cult leader. For the life of your children, keep them out of Crossroads of St. Louis/Kansas City, Pathways of Phoenix and Tuscon, Insight of Atlanta/South Carolina and Corner stone of Colorodo. These programs are dangerous and abusive. See On the Emmis.com to read stories of the abuse, heartache, loss and death that victims of Meehan's destructive cults have endured.I am a victim of these cults as are my family. There are thousands of others who have experienced the mind control and vicious exploitation of the monster known as Bob Meehan.I have watched people go to their graves because of Bob Meehan."
5,Solutions for Parents That Make Sense!,"Bob Meehan's approach to adolescent substance abuse problems in this country is still the only logical approach I've read. The idea that a teenager must WANT to be sober in order to stay that way is logical. The treatment industry has been busy trying to be attractive to parents and appease them with depressive and attention deficit diagnosis that are ""easily"" resolved with more drugs. This book uses common sense - teenagers make decisions based on what is attractive to them. Teenagers must be shown the attractive, fun, enthusiastic side of recovery - or there won't be any. If you are a parent and your child is using drugs and alcohol - please read this book, it helped save my life."
4,One of the Greats,I picked this book up on a trip about 6 years ago. It nearly ruined the trip. I couldn't put it down. This is the first in a great trilogy. I am shocked that the second and third book are out of print! I only wish more people knew of this series and gave it a try. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it has been so long since I read it. Pick this one up if you're thinking about it!
5,Great story telling,"This is the first book i've read by the author Harry Harrison and it was very enjoyable. It might not be a classic, but who cares? It's epic, the characters are interesting and it is a page turner -- this is speculative science fiction at its best. Dinosaurs were the dominate vertebrates of the planet for approximately 130 million years; what would have happened if they were not wiped out? I've often thought about it; this well done piece of fiction speculates on that quite well.Easy to get into and intelligently written."
4,one of the most creative books I've read in a long time.,"This book is one of the most creative and imaginative books I've read in a long time. The world of the Yilane is so well-constructed it feels real and convincing. The living cities of the Yilane are astoundingly described and constructed. The Yilane language itself is an act of considerable imagination. Harrison's prose style is not especially good and his characters, especially his human characters, seem a little flat, but his world makes up for it."
1,Where is a Comet when You Need it?,"This is an interesting premise (that's why I bought it) and an awful read.As characters, the saurians had no appeal to make me care what happened to them and, frankly, neither did the humans. I was longing for Enya, the ""26-million-year death-star"" to reduce the whole bunch of them to a fine powder."
4,A Unique Concept,"I have longed considered Harry Harrision one of the masters of the science fiction genre. In West of Eden, Harry Harrison takes his considerable literary talents a step further. This novel is based in a what-if world where the mass extinction of the dinosuars never occured, thus allowing a species of intelligent dinosuars to evolve. Harry Harrison, imbues this intelligent race of dinosuars with its own unique culture, language and characteristics. He not only creates a story, but a whole vivid world filled with a strange assortment of animals and compelling characters. In creating this whole new world he invokes the scholary aspect of Tolkein's writing such as creating a large appendix that contains the history of the world and a section on the finer points and pronunciation of the languagues he creates. Combining this scholarship with an easy to read story produces a book of excellent breadth and scope. Reminds me a lot of ""Battlefield Earth."""
5,Collar and leash in one,This is an innovative approach to a dogs collar. There is a built in leash for quick control. It is very well made and sturdy enough for the largest dog. The colors are excellent and the design is excellent. It is comfortable and sturdy.
2,No Jesus's Son....,"Wow, where to start? The story is a disjointed mess, seemingly without purpose. The story starts with an introduction to an American woman in Nicaragua who has to sleep with a plethora of government officials in order to keep her press pass and make money in order to live. But the big question of the book is, is our heroine indeed a journalist or part of an orginazation called Eyes for Peace? That question is never answered. She then gets herself in a big mess with an English business man she meets and then sleeps with for $50. They end up on the run from the Costa Rican OIJ(police), with disastrous results.While there were some moments of poetic writing and insight on the whole the characters lacked motivation for just about everything they were doing. If you're new to Denis Johnson start with Jesus's Son. If I had read this book first I would never have gone on to read anything else of his."
1,The biggest purchase-mistake I ever made!!,"The batterie of the ipod-hp 30GB gave up within the FIRST month,and I didn't even use it very frequently. The support by HP is pretty annoying - by asking 3 service people about the conditions on replacing that thing, I got 3 different answers --my recommendation: stay away from overprized ipods and if you should get one maybe take the original apple ones, but never decide to get an ipod from HP!!!"
3,Mac?,"I just got an Apple + HP 20gig iPod, yes I realize that this is the 30 gig site, but I couldn't find the page for the 20 that was Apple and HP. I tried installing the iTunes into my Windows ME and it didn't work, it said that I needed to upgrade to either Windows 2000 or Windows XP. Now I'm thinking about buying a new computer from Apple, does anyone know if my iPod will work on an Apple as well as a Windows?"
1,Jakes Does It Again,"The novel Charleston is presumably John Jakes' tribute to the golden age of that famous city, but in reading this novel one is left with exactly the opposite impression. Aside from the shallow, one-dimensional characters and impossible plot points---a slave owner's daughter turning abolitionist and sleeping with black men?---this book is so prejudiced against its subject matter that it eclipses any historical value it might have held. As for entertainment: it's predictable, silly, and laced with anti-southern sentiments."
2,Not so Funny,"I used to watch this show all the time, and have many fond memories of the hilarious skits. Unfortunately on this DVD there are very few of the good skits on this. Sorry I spent the money on it."
2,"Passe, At Best -","Times have changed - her show was one of my favorites when televised, but now reviewing the same material it's too predictable and not very entertaining."
5,Love it!!,Just like sitting and watching TV in grandma and grandpa's livingroom on a Saturday night all over again! Good times!!!
4,love carol burnett,"I have 2 dvd's of carol burnett, both include the famous ""Went with the Wind"". I would've prefered another episode instead, she is a very funny lady and I loved watching her tv show, so I was just hoping for some kind of tv show sequence to her dvd's."
3,"Unfortunately, Carole's favorites are not my favs.","There are only three episodes the disk and unfortunately, Caroles favs are not my favs. I liked watching the old shows and seeing the randomness of it. I think there should be more episodes more for the money."
4,Bright Orange for Shro,"Great book, almost everything MacDonald writes is exciting and a good read. Travis McGee is one of my favorite book characters. MacDonald handles the growing maturity of his character well."
5,One of MacDonald's darkest,"I've read almost every title in the McGee series, and this is surely one of McGee's more disturbing adventures. As in 'A Fearful Yellow Eye', one of the villains is a rapist, so the reader should be prepared to read about that particular evil. (But it is just one aspect to the story, though.)I concur with other reviewers -- the plot is straightforward. And the characters -- particularly the protagonists -- are easy to identify with and enjoy.One thing was missing, however: MacDonald, through the worldview of McGee, usually works in a few mini-essays into the narrative. These insightful asides are usually about people, politics, or life in general. I don't recall any from this particular McGee mystery."
5,Perfect to out-and-about cheapskates like me,"I love my cell phone flask. It goes everywhere I don't feel like spending $12 for a Jameson and Coke. The only thing is, what cell phone nowadays is this huge? Still, it's fun for novelty sake. I've convinced my friend to get her own since she kept bogarting mine."
1,"Good service, not good product","Great price, fast delivery, not good product. I used it once (clearly it was bought as a gag gift), and it rusted on the inside....GROSS! Would not recommend!"
5,What a GAS !,"This flask has passed the scrutiny of several arena employees and security staff. We use it all the time and howl every time we say ""This place sure serves tasty sodas !""."
4,Life could be dream,"If you wish to dive deep into the 50's this disc should be your choice. I was not familiar with The Crew Cuts before and was relying solely on their hit ""Sh-boom (Life could be dream)"" Their music is satisfying to those who love 50's. However, if you not sure if you totally in love with this kind of music try a CD with variety of artists."
3,CREW CUTS MEDIUM WELL DONE,THIS CD HAS A LOT OF SONGS THAT OTHERS MADE HITS. THE CREW CUTS VERSIONS OF THOSE SONGS ARE DISAPPOINTING. HOWEVER THEIR SIGNATURE TUNES ARE GREAT.
2,Disappointing,"It's a very short read. As much as I liked Ishmael and The Story of B, this didn't impress me as much. I got the feeling that Quinn is now publishing books just to make money. That's kind of disappointing to me and if you are familiar with Quinn's work perhaps you would understand. I think it's the kind of book that you could read over and over and sometime get a ""Ah-Ha"" thought."
1,Not the best,"This book is not very interesting and very disappointing. After reading Ishmael, I was excited to read more by the author. Whoops, this book is not well written."
5,One of my all time favorites,"Daniel Quinn is my all time favorite author. My top three favorites he wrote are Ishmael, Tales of Adam, and Providence: The Story of a Fifty Year Vision Quest. Tales of Adam is a quick, enlightening and delightful read. It is well worth it. I highly recommend!Tales of Adam"
2,What a disappointment,"While the book is certainly an easy read with interesting characters, it was about as shallow and trite as an ""after-school special. I have trouble understadning why everyone enjoyed it so much. The writing evoked very little emotion in me, which is especially surprising considering some of the sad moments in this book. I never felt who the characters truly were nor what they were feeling. The overused references to the Home felt so forced, it was more like a reading an assignment in middle school. What am I missing? I guess it was fun, just as soap operas can be fun?"
5,AMAZING!!!!,"I absolutely loved this book. There are so many lessons to be learned. It made me cry tears of happiness and of sadness. I had no choice but to reomend it to those I know. They too, loved it and this coming summer this masterpiece will be placed on my high school reading list. But it is a book for everyone. A must read! Enjoy!"
2,"Billie Letts Never Challenges Her Characters, or Her Readers","Although this is a charming tale, it's a little too fluffly to be considered good literature. Billie Letts never allows her characters to show us anything that would make us want to be like them, that would make us admire them, that would make us better understand our own lives. Her main character, Novalee Nation is constantly rescued in quite unbelievable ways, from challenging situations. As a teenage mother, bills, childcare, career, even race relations, are not a problem. Ha! Too bad we all can't charm away these difficult issues. However, if you're looking for an escape from reality, this is a good selection."
5,"I loved it, .",The story reads like all of the characters could be your neighbors down the street even if you live in the big city. I found myself rooting for Novalee and Americus. I recommend everyone reads this book.
2,Like a Gooey Hallmark Card,"I cannot believe Oprah selected this book. It's not a bad book. The reader definitely flips the pages to see what happens to the likable characters. However, it is a goo-fest of sentimentality. It's like reading a 350-page, cliche-ridden Hallmark card. This novel is second-rate Barbara Kingsolver."
5,charming,"For a novel based on a seemingly normal plot, Billie Letts captures the heart. This is a definate read...a not able to put down book, perfect for a rainy day."
4,"It was a good, soul searching book.","There were twists and turns with each chapter. I enjoyed this book because it represented the simple life of a young girl, and the difficult decisions that we all have to make in life."
5,GRABBED MY ATTENTION FROM PAGE ONE TO THE FINISH,How could anyone not like Novalee Nation and the way she forms a family for herself and her daughter. The people she meets that help her form this family are truly remarkable in there richness of character.
4,A single parent surrounded by support,"Novalee has had a tough childhood, but seemingly chance encounters at a Walmart end up changing her life for the better. A diversity of characters end up coming together to support this young mother, each in their own special way. This book demonstrates that ""family"" doesn't have to be just blood relatives!"
5,Great book!!! Truely a story for readers who enjoy a good s,"Where The Heart is was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. Following the life of Novalee Nation was very exciting, starting from the first chapter in the car with Willy Jack to the last chapter of taking him back to Tennessee. I am from Oklahoma and know the area where the book was based! All I can say is way to go Billie Letts on potraying the Great State of Oklahoma!!!!! I have already loaned my copy out to several people and each of them have said that they too love the book."
5,A wonderful novel....laugh out loud funny!,"Billie Letts has written a wonderful novel! When I wasn't laughing out loud I was crying. This book truly captures the South and the wonderful individuals who make it so unique. Letts allows you to not only get to know her characters, but to become their friends....I highly recommend this book to you. I loved it!"
5,"always keeping you on your toes, kept you glued to the book","I don't read many books because I tend to loose interest in them too quickly, but I loved the book, you could relate to Novelee. The author kept her readers wanting to know what's going to happen next. This book was totally awesome!"
2,Pregnant girl gets dumped and carries on.,"The first chapter of this book draws the reader in, but unfortunately, the actual plot doesn't start until page 185 and gets resolved on page 200 and the rest of the books just rambles on with various characters thrown in to take up space. I kept reading to discover what all the fuss was about and was left feeling unsatisfied."
3,a quick read,"yes, I think I finished this book in about a day, but don't let that fool you into thinking that it was overly entertaining. It, quite honestly, was kind of useless, kind of silly, and rather trite. Too fairy-taleish for my taste. Could the novel have been any more predictable? To the reader who complained about the ""not normal"" names: most are Native-American. That was the one redeaming quality of the book. Letts tries to diversify. But, after just fininshing SHE'S COME UNDONE, I didn't feel this book rated five stars, the way Lamb's did. Read that one if you're interested in more than beach reading."
4,Good Reading,"I decided to get this book from the great reviews from Oprah and her book club. I love the book and I am half way threw it, and it is so hard to put down. I love Oprah's book club and not once since she started it a few years ago I have been disapointed from it. To all who is looking for a great reading experance buy the book! Thank you"
1,"""Make Stupid Decisions and Let Others Take Responsibility""","Just what we need. A pregnant teenager breaking the law, getting the government to pay her way, and stumbling on lots of luck and a bunch of kind hearted people to help her out of the stupid decisions she made!"
4,Where the Heart Is,"I have never enjoyed reading very much but I became totally captived from the very first page. Where the Heart Is, entertains and inspires in a way that is sure to capture any reader who longs for a good old-fashioned, heartwarming story. The pregant seventeen year-old Novalee Nation believes that she is leaving her hard life behind her in Tennessee and starting fresh with her baby's father in Bakersfield, California. What she does not bargin for is being abandoned outside a Wal-Mart in Sequoyah, Oklahoma, with only $7.77. We watch the struggling teenager become a mother, a women, and finally a lover. Novalee may have been lost in Tennessee, but she finds herself in Oklahoma."
2,Where in Oklahoma is THIS???,"This book reads like a high school creative writing assignment. It's predictable and not very deep. When I first came to Oklahoma, a woman said to me ""[Us Oklahomans]aren't like in Where the Heart is, but we're some of the nicest people you'll ever meet"". The movie is cute, but the book is rather silly. Take a vacation to Oklahoma and walk around the Wal-Marts here, it's far more entertaining than the book is."
4,Truth and redemption in a trailer park,"About to give birth in a Walmart, where she's been living since being dumped there by her no-good boyfriend, Novalee meets a set of eccentric, wonderful, truly good friends. They sustain her and her daughter through the trials and astonishments of the next few years. We watch with awe and hope as she matures into a gifted photographer and mother, and friend herself. The people are just odd enough to keep us wondering, and just delightful enough to keep us cheering them on as we watch destiny unfold in a most unlikely setting."
2,"A disappointingly predictable, syrupy-sweet fairy tale...","The beginning of this book is excellent, promising an original story with intriguing characters but further reading reveals the disappointingly predictable, syrupy-sweet fairy tale that it actually is. I ordered Where the Heart Is despite it being an Oprah selection because of the rave customer reviews and now I wish I had followed through with my vow to avoid books that Oprah recommends after forcing myself to finish a couple other of her selections!"
1,Terrible,"I am an avid subscriber to Oprah's Book Club. I have read most of the books in her club, but was thoroughly dissappointed in this selection. I didn't find the book to be suspenseful at all. It dragged on an on. The only thing I was waiting for was for the book to end. Readers beware!"
1,The worst book I've read this year !,"I took this book along on a trip just in case we encountered rain. Let me tell you, I'd rather watch rain fall than continue reading this book. Americus ??? How incredibly smarmy. I just couldn't identify with Novalee or any of the other characters. Oprah, review something with more depth, please !"
3,A story with promise but not fulfilled,The book was o.k. but the violent scene with Brownie and Lexie seemed so out of place. It was like the author threw them in for the shock value. This whole storyline was brushed over and never fully resolved. The author needs to tie up all the loose ends to make this book a lot better.
5,great,the movie pretty much stayed true to this wonderful book.i read it because i loved the movie and after i got finished i let my friend read it and she enjoyed it. i reccomend this book for all fans of the movie.
2,This reads like the novelization of a movie,"This book is vacuous and the characters seem like cheap imitations of quirky country folk. Walmart is depicted as some sort of haven for troubled souls which indicates that this book would have to have been written by an American. I am not surprised that Oprah picked this sappy, tugging at the heart strings book. The writing style is approachable and credible which redeems it slightly and allows it to earn two stars. The plot is thin and convoluted. What is clearly intended to be an inspirational ""girl climbs her way from bottom to top"" story is lost on me. I could not warm up to any of the characters including and especially Novalee."
5,The Walmart Baby,"Novalee is a character that many young women can relate to. She comes from a bad upbringing, falls for the wrong guy, and ends up pregnant. She finds herself in a bad situation 7 months pregnant with only $7.77 left to her name and her boyfriend runs off. Giving birth in asle 7 at Walmart only adds to her problems. Lucky for her she is well cared for by the town's ""welcome wagon"", Sister Hazel. Novalee finds true friendship and love. It just takes her longer to realize what being in love really feels like. The movie is good but the book is better."
4,A book about people that care!,"I loved the book; it made me realize that there are people out there, that will lend out a hand to you, and take you in when there is nobody else! Novalee was very gracious to have the friends that she did in this book!!!"
3,Where the Heart Is,"The story begins with Novalee Nation, seventeen, unmarried and pregnant who is left by her boyfriend to scrounge by living in a local Wal-Mart miles from her hometown. After her daughter, Americus, is born (in Wal-Mart), she is able to pull herself together, get a job (in Wal-Mart) and develop meaningful relationships in the new town especially after all the publicity. Through the people she meets, she is able to take the good from each one and with a little bit of luck learns to build a quality life for herself despite all of the strikes against her. She learns the meaning of real love from her friends Forney Hull, Sister Husband and Moses Whitecotton. She is able to give to others especially those in need including Lexie and Willy Jack, the father of Americus. Overall, the story has a meaningful message, but tended to have a long drawn-out and depressing plot. The reader's voice had a much exaggerated Southern accent that was distracting."
2,If you want to read something that is not challenging...,"If you are out for a book that takes little brain power and is a quick read, you may find this enjoyable. This book is has a very simplitic writing style and reads at about an 8th grade level. On the other hand, if you are looking for something that actually makes you think and reflect on society, don't waste your time on this one."
2,I Couldn't find where the heart was...,"This is one of the few books that I quit reading half way through. I could not have cared anything for the characters with their silly names. I really could not find ""where or who's heart it was! "" Oprah let me down on this one, along with The Pilot's Wife. A silly read."
4,Go Wal Mart,This is the first book I have read from Ms. Letts. I think she has a unique style of writing. Her characters are believable. I enjoyed the book thoroughly and could not put it down. I kept wanting to know what was next. I was only disappointed with the end. I always want to know more. It left me hanging.
4,Where The Heart Is,"This book is an easy read. The story follows Novalee growing up as a pregnant teenager in America. Novalee was left by herself to raise her daughter. Throughout the book, it shows how Novalee deals with the problems that arise. We liked this book because it kept our attention and it was plot driven. New and different events kept happening, so we were always on our toes. Although some parts of the book were not believable, others made you think how this could happen to you. This is a very good book and we suggest you read it!"
4,Great Read - Terrible Ending,"I really enjoyed Where the Heart Is. I think that it would be a great book for high school senior English classes to read. I wanted to read it prior to viewing the movie so that I would really know what happened to Novalee Nation. I was intrigued by the thought of this seventeen year old girl having a baby in a Walmart. Unfortunately, the ending did not have as much depth as the previous chapters did. However, I would like to read a sequel to this work."
4,Hang in there; a great story that takes a little time to get,Definately worth the read; it takes a little time to get into the story and also at times you will wonder where the author is going but it is a terrific book.
1,I found this book to be boring and predictable.,"I have been reading a number of books from Oprah's book club, and I must say that this is the worst I've read. The plot is merely a story of a girl who goes to a new town where she runs into one problem after another in a seemingly disconnected series of events. Letts seems to have said, ""OK, what can I make happen now?"" It's predictable, and it's a book where you just pray for the boring and obvious ending."
2,ermmmm ... well ...,"Easy to read, maybe good for a movie but there is nothing special about it. Where The Heart Is did not leave me with any kind of impression and I don't think I will remember the story after few weeks. It's a story and not a novel"
5,Let's Have More Books by Letts!,"This was without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. It's probably not a good read for a pessimist, but for the rest of us it is so inspiring. Ms. Letts did a beautiful job of crafting the characters, making them vulnerable, human & believable. Oprah sure can pick them. Now I can't wait to see the movie, and I sure hope there is a sequel to this book. I want to see how she can take these wonderful characters to another level. This was a quick read (too quick for my tastes); I wanted to continue, and felt like I had lost friends when I finished reading it. Please write a sequel, Ms. Letts!"
4,"I never get to the movies, so...","...I decided to buy the book. I always buy books that are movies and i never finish them...well, i finished this one. It was the last copy at my local Waldens and knowing the movie looked good, I bought it.I read it in less than a day. Every single character in this book was interesting and i loved seeing what unfolded for them.I loved how it was a very easy read too...no complex lawyer-like words that no one understands anyway...it was a page turner and i suggest that you read it!"
2,OVERRATED,"Where The Heart Is is a great read, not to mention would make an even better movie...but it's pretty over-the-top and fake! Of course it is-it's a great story..but connection with the characters was not even close. Just borrow it...don't buy."
5,captures ur heart,"i really loved this book,it captured my heart from the beginning till the end. I applaud the author for this brilliant masterpiece"
4,A charming and engaging book,"This is an enjoyable read for a rainy day, but it does not have the emotional impact of a somewhat similar book, The Bean Tree by Barbara Kingsolver. Still, those who like Barbara Kingsolver are likely to enjoy this book as well. My chief complaint is that the book requires too much of a suspension of disbelief -- it is hard for me to imagine that a person who endured what the lead character did as a child and teenager would not have been far more damaged by those events than this book shows her. Still, it was an engaging and pleasurable read."
5,I loved Novalee's spirit. Great book.,"I need a statement from the author about where she was born. I would like permission to let our speech students read from the book for UIL competition in prose.Address: Virginia Crawford, P.O.Box 189, Elysian Fields, TX 75642or email: gincrawford99@yahoo.comThanks!"
5,Thankyou for a great time Ms. Letts!!,This was a great book I couldn't put it down and I can't find another book to take it's place. I can't say enough about the town that she was fortunate / unfortunate (how ever you might look at it) enough to be left in. It makes you wonder if there is really such a place in our world today?? Everytime I go to Wal-Mart now I think of her and smile. Thank you Billie Letts !!!
4,Great Fun,"I would never have read this book based on the synopsis, but the good reviews made me curious. I have to agree - this book was an extremely engaging read. I started reading in the morning, and didn't stop until that evening when I finished the book. I simply had to find out what happened to Novalee and Americus Nation and the wonderful supporting cast. Uplifting and fun."
5,Right up there with Fried Green Tomatoes and Cold Sassy Tree,One of the best novels I have read this past year. It's a must read for our book club.
3,Good but just a little cheesy,"While I generally liked the book, I couldn't help but feel as if I were reading a cheesy, dime-store novel. The characters were interesting but somehow each one was like a cliche of typical Southerners. Every chapter some new disaster took place but somehow, Novalee is always able to overcome and wind up with her feet on the ground. While this may be inspiring, it is not wholly believable in the real world."
3,Predictable,"I like any novel that has richly developed characters, and ""Where The Heart Is"" certainly does. They are as vivid and memorable as any of those in ""Mother of Pearl"" or ""The Triumph and the Glory"". I was not as happy with the plot however, I found it rather obvious where things were headed. Still, this is a good book for the beach or the lake, not every novel has to be a Pultizer Prize winner to be worth reading."
5,Important reading for discovering how powerful we all can be,"At the age of 48, I've been where Novalee Nation, the book's lead character, is. As the mother of two teenaged daughters, I'm watching my life replay itself, with a 90's flair. Mothers and daughters need to read ``Where the Heart is..'' and travel across the dusty roads of the mid-west, live life in the bathroom of a Walmart and feel good as Novalee takes her shattered life and fills it with the things that count. I've bought two copies so far, one for each of my daughters who decided life on the street was better than life here at home. I'm sending a third to their 18 year old friend who is doing 15 to life for her involvement in the murder of a 17 year old boy. I'm thinking the book will take her beyond her gray walls and allow her to travel with Novalee, finding out about the good people in life. This book's a keeper. Fern"
4,Good Natured! and Excellent Written,"This book was a really good thrilling novel to read. It made me read and read and read and not put the book down until I read it cover to cover. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a good book to read. It is about a person who is lives in WalMart and Gives birth to a baby girl named Americus in Walmart. Forney the librarian makes the best for her... to find out more, read the book!"
3,Heartwarming and uplifting,"I enjoyed this book, although it was not as thought provoking as some of Oprah's other pick's. This was a book not for deep thought but it made me feel better about the world. Yes there are many real life events in the story that are sad but this book is about one woman and her drive to live and be happy. I think most of us can find some good in this book."
2,Plot development?,"The other reviewers are right: this book was entertaining. But it had no plot development and just plain no plot - unless you count people who are mean to Novalee getting their just deserts as a plot. It was just an entertaining ramble, no beginning, middle or end, pointless.Like having marshmallows for dinner."
1,Two hours of my life that I will never get back were wasted.,"It serves me right for buying another Oprah selection. When am I going to learn that even if Oprah makes it sound good, a book with such a ridiculous premise is not going to work. My six year old son could have come up with a story that was more realistic, less contrived and less predictable."
1,Pass by this one,I was very disappointed in this book and didn't even bother to finish it. If you like dysfunctional lives go ahead. Personally once I read about a man being attracted to a 12 year old girl the rest of the story seems a bit of a waste. I prefer books that are pleasant to read and not brutal. Call me strange but I'd read any of Jan Karon's Mitford books 10 times over than start another like this.
4,Great Book Club Selection,"The story was interesting with memorable characters and situations. My book club had fun discussing the book and answering the questions provided in the back. We also found the interview with the author engaging. This helped to give great insight into the story, the setting and the timeframe."
1,Dumb,"I couldn't even finish this.One character is a stalker whom we are supposed to like.The main character is a thief and we are supposed to like her.I don't think so.I know this was an ""Oprah"" book so that was supposed to make it literature????I don't think so.Perhaps a publisher paid Oprah to promote this drivel?"
1,The main character killed it for me,"I stopped reading this. I was 200 pages in by the time I stopped. I like the author's writing style, easy to follow along with and not overly bogged down with descriptions. I was hoping for this to be a charming southern novel, but the protagonist was so naive and dumb that I just got tired of reading about her. I didn't relate to her one bit."
4,Wonderful Book,"I really enjoyed this book even though everything just fell into place for the main character. That just does not happen in real life. But over all I really enjoyed the book. Good story and a good ""feel good"" book."
4,Reading,I am currently reading this on amazon kindle via an app on my phone. The price was a little high but it is a great book.
5,I began this book at 8:00 and finished it by 12:00.,"Where the Heart Is by Billie Letts is a book that I read in four hours because I wanted to know that Novalee, a seventeen-year-old pregnant girl would survive alone. Family and boyfriends could abandon her and steal from her, but complete strangers would give to her and love her. Novalee Nation is a survivor because of the love of people around her as well as her hidden inner strength. She is the type of character that grows and changes through learning, hardships, and love. She is the type of woman that I admire. She has nothing in the beginning, except herself, and she gradually learns that this is all that she needs when she finally learns to love herself. We all love Novalee Nation as she is apart of the lesson that we all need to learn: Loving ourselves is the best part of life. Read this book and fall in love with Novalee Nation and with life itself."
4,A great book that you can read quickly.,This was an ejoyable book. Novalee really grew up from her experiences. It was great to read a book that puts some much emphasis on the joys of reading.
1,Where's the paper shredder?,"I'm not sure if you can give a book 0 stars, but this would be the one! If people actually find this book inspirational then they are the hopeless ones. This book is so unrealistic. How many pregnant 17 years olds could get it that easy? I'll admit this book makes it look pretty good. Maybe we should all get pregnant, head to Wal-Mart, meet Sam along with the other wonderful people of this Oklahoma town where money just comes to us in the mail. To top it off Novalee is an empty character. She has no personality and I saw no change or growth in her character througout the book. Some good uses for the book shreddings: a) line hamster cage b) good for packaging c) fill room with shreddings as a joke (that way you'll need to shred even more of them)"
2,Where's the beef?,I found this book sugary sweet and the characters unbelievable. Sorry...I really tried to like it. But the book reads too much like a Hallmark card.
2,Not what I thought,"The story was pretty good at first, but after I was done with half of it I had to force my self to read the rest. It was so unrealistic and had a child molesting part that I didn't like. It wasn't worth my time. I'm sorry that I got it. It disturbed me."
1,This should have been a Wal-mart commercial.,"This is a poor excuse for a novel. The characters are trite and one-dimensional, with not much to offer. I hope Oprah has better taste in interior design than she does in literature."
5,"A Beautiful, Magical, and Heartwarming Book!","This book is excellent, filled with so many things that you never forget. It's a story of a young girl named Novalee, trying to find a life in a town that her boyfriend dumps her out in. She finds wonderful people to love and care for her in this town she winds up in.She's seventeen and seven months pregnat. Her boyfriend, Willy Jack, lets her go inside of a Walmart store, then leaves her. She lives inside of the store, meeting friends who are unforgettable characters in this novel. She makes friends who will be there for her when times are tough, who will never let her down.Read this wonderuful journey that Novalee takes, having the most exciting experiences, adn you'll also see the road that Wilyl Jack goes down. This book is a complete pageturner, a wonderful read. It's filled with heartbreaking moments, also with moments that will fill your heart with so much joy!"
5,Captivating and Different,"I just couldn't put this book down. It was incredible. The life of Novalee was different and full of surprises. Her obsession with luck was funny, her talent with a camera was enriching, her love life was suspensful, and her friends were crazy and entertaining. The entire book was full of laughs, meaning, romance, and ""mystery"". I loved it."
5,Can't get enough,The only disapointing thing about this book was that it had to end. I give it five stars. The characters are irrestible and the book itself is addictive.Don't make the mistake of watching the movie. I rented it on video after I finished the book. It was a let-down.
2,Coming of age story for the down and out Novalee,"Poor Novalee, seventeen, pregnant and abandoned by her boyfriend. Amazingly she lives in the Walmart by night and devours books at the library by day. All the characters in this book are a little over the top. None of the events in the book have much basis in reality. It is enough to start to believe all those bad ""southern"" jokes that are popular on the internet. The be true to your heart ending wraps it all up in a neat package at the end. This is not a terrific book, but has enough character appeal to help you make it to the end."
4,I loved this book!,I would definitely read a sequel. I found this book to be uplifting. It beautifully describes the strenghth and tenacity of the human spirit. I am always encouraged by that. I couldn't put the book down until I had finished it! I would highly recommend it!
2,"Stupid plot, idiotic names, cop out ending",I think this book was really terrible. It was so contrived that you could guess what was going to happen. I found it predictable and boring as well as on the insipid side. I think Oprah can choose better books than this for her book club!
3,in the begining there was wit and great imagination.,"I have lived in oklahoma for most of my fifty years. Also, have owned this book since 1996. It is a first addition and is signed to my husband as a fellow writer. My interest began partly because of this and a TV show. I found the begining to be full of witicism and imagination. I laughed out loud. And during the middle of the book, I became somewhat confused due to the conglomeration of characters. I also think that the heroine, Novalee, is too good to be true. A Miss goody-two shoes. Unfortunatly, the ending left me at a loss. (and I read it several times). I intend to read Ms. Letts other book, soon."
2,"pseudo-emotional, over the top","A drawn out tearjerker of a novel with a couple of reedeming features but frankly- there are much better books out there to read. Oprah's picks of I know this much is true, she's come undone, and midwives were much better books."
3,At first a modern Canterbury Tales...,"while she is still figuring out where to turn after being abandoned at Wal-Mart. It is a warm and fuzzy read about the nature of humans...if you can get past the plight of Brummet. That scene was extremely disturbing and I found it overkill if the author was trying to shed light on blind trust in the hands of an evil spirit. It was an okay book, but Oprah has picked better."
2,Unimpressed.,"It started out kinda quirky and entertaining, but then about one third of the way through, it began to fall apart. As I read on, the plot became less cohesive and it continued to unravel like a poorly knit sweater. The romance part was dragged-out for a ludicrous amount of time ending with a silly conclusion. About halfway through, I began to beg for the end. It's good for a light read, but overall I thought it was insipid."
5,This book is profoundly writen to take your heart away.,This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I love it how Billie Letts uses discriptive and unforgetable detail. This is well written!!
5,Uplifts the human spirit!!!,"Billie Letts writes an account of human endurance and our spirits' ability to triumph despite terrible circumstance. Novalee Nation is an inspiring character who teaches us the power to overcome and not be weakened by a ""victim-mentality"". An incredible read!"
2,A soap opera for teenagers,"I think that with this book, Oprah has reduced her book choices to the lowest common denominator. The novel is at best an instructive read for a 14 or 15 year old girl because it contains straightforward, canned lessons on the dangers of teenage pregnancy and the importance of building self-esteem as an independent woman of character and substance. As a literary work, however, it is predictable, with rather flat sterotypical characters, and simplistic expressions of what could be complicated themes. It is an insult to the intelligence of most mature adults. Over all, it is a huge disappointment."
3,"OK, but unbelievable","This was a good book with interesting but unrealistic characters. Maybe I'm just cynical, but I don't believe all those people would be so nice to her. I also don't believe anyone can make such a drastic change in their personality as Willie Jack did. In real life, he would have been even more bitter and tried to get money from Novalee."
3,Pleasant but not memorable,"Novalee Nation, a seventeen year-old pregnant girl from Tennessee, is deserted at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma when her loser of a boyfriend drives off without her on their way out to California. She ends up staying there, living in the Wal-Mart until she has her child in the store. The book is the story of how she develops relationships with an eclectic group of friends in the town, raises her child, and eventually develops a sense of her own worth.I found this a pleasant book, and I generally cheered for Novalee to make good decisions and to grow some confidence, but I didn't connect with her story. I found her collection of friends only weakly drawn, so it was difficult to relate to them or understand them. The only real passion this book aroused in me was a hatred of her boyfriend, whose story is told in a few chapters interwoven into Novalee's story. A perfectly good read, but I don't think I'll remember this book very well over time."
4,Couldn't Put Down,"I'm not a big reader unless it's a really good book. This one I could not put down from the first page. The story seemed so realistic and gripping. My heart went out to Novalee, a young girl who didn't waiver when life dealt her a bad hand. She was an inspiration to me and I learned many other things I never thought I could learn from a fictional book (I read a lot of self-development books). It turned out not to be just entertainment, but lessons in life."
2,"why, oprah, why?","I have read approximatley four of the Oprah book club books. and this was the latest one i tried to read. why must she always pick the lamest books? with annoying characters ? and somewhat depressing circumstances? How many times can we read about some poor soul that has lost their way and tries to find it throughout the book! this is just so far fetched and sugar coated. this book did start off okay, and i did somewhat like the style of billie letti's writing. but then it just got to the point where nothing good was happening, i totally lost interest in the characters and couldn't even finish the bore. i skimmed the last couple of chapters just to see what happened..which wasn't much! total disappointment on my part. if you have found any of oprah's selections bad in the past, skip this one."
2,Where the Heart Is,"I found this book overly simplistic. I kept waiting for an interesting plot twist or some deeper meaning, but I was never satisfied. I am at a loss to figure out what attracted Oprah and everyone else to this book. It's a quick read, perhaps a good ""beach book,"" but I still don't know what all the fuss is about."
3,"Beautiful, but highly improbable tale.","Billie Letts certainly is a good writer and her characterisation is wonderful. However, one feels that one girl's magical escape from poverty and deprivation ignores the real problems of those in the same boat. There cannot be a magical solution for everyone. The book fails to really address effectively society's responsibility for its evils. Nevertheless, a charming read."
3,"A ""sweet"" book but...","A bookseller recommended this book to me before it had the dubious honour of becoming labelled an Oprah book (us non-Americans don't have the same fascination with Oprah, sorry). I found it to be a ""sweet"" book, but wanted it to end so I could read someting more intellectually stimulating and satisfying. The writing was rather twee at times. Nevertheless it was a heartwarming story, and if you're in the mood for something light, this might be it."
4,a teenage girl in trouble dares to dream and wins.,"A story to give the most downtrodden hope in a world filled with trouble. Never give up your dreams as long as you have breath. For if you succeed than you are ahead of the crowd. Love conquers all and forgives much. Novalee is a strong charactor to identify with and respect. The plot has enough twists and turns to delight, surprise and intertain for a straignt readthrough."
5,This book was inspiring for young readers.,"Where The Heart Is by Billie Letts is about a seventeen year old pregnant girl named Novalee Nation. Novalee was stranded at Wal- Mart by her boyfriend Willie Jack. Left alone Novalee gains friends who are more like family. Discovering the importance of family, love, and life, she realizes something inside of her has lifted the hearts of many others. Hope. In my opinion Billie Letts was trying to explain that there are more things in life besides depression and pain. Billie clearly makes a point across that family is the most important issue in the world. I also think that Billie was trying to say that by reading books people gain knowledge. This is the easiest way. What I find most interesting in this book is how this character Novalee was a very strong independent women and Billie Letts just relates the story to reality"
5,The best book I've read in a long time!!!!!!,I have never read a book that has hit my heart like this one did. The stuggles that Novalee had to go through to find love shows that she was a strong character. I would recommend this book to any person who needs an inspirational story.
4,"I didn't plan to love it, but...","It starts out laughably absurd--a seventeen year old with a buckeye tree secretly lives in a Wal-Mart store. My first thought was, ""Are you kidding? With their security system?"" But the characters are so appealing, it's hard to put this book down."
5,Very much enjoyed,"I'm 14 years old and at first I was a little intimidated by the length of the book, but it was awesome and I read is so fast. I could not put it down. It was one of the best books I ever read and it gave me the feeling that I knew some of the characters or at least wanted to know them in person. I felt like I was in the town where this happened. It really drew me in. I thought all the people who helped Novalee were so friendly and nice. Although it may not have been totally realistic, fiction books aren't supposed to be. It was a very entertaining story with many lessons and morals that more people need to know. I most definetly recommend this book to anyone, although it is graphic at times and uses bad language."
4,Eccentric but EXTRAORDINARY!,I couldn't put this book down and I am not sure why. Perhaps that says it all. I know that says alot about the author. I loved the characters although I never quite understood Forney. This book showed me another side and gave me a true appreciation for my life and all that I have. The only thing that disappointed me in this book is the way it would lead you down a path and then skip to a time in the future. I was so enthralled in this book that I wanted nothing left out. I enjoyed the author's literary style. I laughed and I cried. I got angry and was happy. That is what I liked the most. The ending was quite abrupt but I was not dissatisfied. As far as a movie version. Stick with the book. No one could capture the emotion and raw experience that the author filled us with on film. Truly enjoyable. I passed it on to a friend.
2,I thought they must have dumbed down the...,"...book to make the movie; but it's a hard contest to know which is MORE dumb! (I know, great English on my part). It was enjoyable, not great literature. It gives me a pretty good idea of what Oprah's book club must be like."
2,Couldn't get through it,"Someone loaned me this book -- I would not have bought it on my own or even heard about it, since I'm not an Oprah watcher and mystery is my genre of choice. I gave this book 2 stars, even though I didn't finish it, because the characters are memorable -- I just grew weary of reading about their depressing lives. Later, I ran across the movie on TV -- in progress -- and I watched it to find out what happened in the end. I liked the music in the movie very much. I guess you could say that I was just not impressed."
2,"This book was captivating the first time, but the 2&3..","I loved this book the first time I picked it up. I loved it so much I decided to read it a second time. Good decision. I realized that this book is basically a series of tragic events, one after another, no climax, no plot. Some events are completely unnecessary and just confuse thereader further. There is too much going on and there no clear point to the story."
2,Shocking and unnecessary violence,"I was enjoying this book until I came to the shocking violence involving children which I could not get past. When I picked up this book and read on the back ""...moving, funny, and unforgettable journey.."" I did not expect such disturbing content that I cannot get out of my mind now. I am surprised that Oprah endorses this book involving the violence against children. I think the book could have hinted some sort of warning for the weak hearted like myself. It seems everyone enjoys this book and the wonderful characters, but how do they get past a boy getting raped?"
3,What a life!,"I read this book because it was the only book I found at the school's rummage sale!I really enjoyed it.. it is a very tragic story but with a happy ending! It made me laugh, it made me cry .. and sometimes totally shocked..The language is direct and sensitive ..the style is poetic .. I could draw a picture in my mind of all the characters, the library, the garden... you feel like you are with them watching as they move around you .. trying their best to beat all the odds..A beautiful journey of strength .. self-confidence and determination.. what the love and support of friends can do.. miracles!!"
4,Wal.Mart Security,"I thoroughly enjoyed Where the Heart Is, a very good read, although one question bothered me. It was the issue of security at Wal-Mart. I find it hard to believe that someone could live in the store undetected for that long a period. Surely, Wal-Mart security personnel, or someone, would have discovered her hiding there at night and eating food and wearing clothes off the rack. And Willy Jack's punishmentfor leaving Novalee abandoned in a small Oklahoma town was too severe. The parts about him actually detracted from the beautiful pace of the novel. Also what happened to Novalee's Momma. She comes in quickly and exits just as quick. Nevertheless, I recommend it to you."
5,I Love It!,"I am 14 years old and I loved this book. My mother, sister, and grandmother read it swell and they loved it. You know a book is good when it appeals to such a wide range of ages. The previous reviews do a good job of summarizing the book so I won't repeat what other people have said about it. I just want to clear up anyone's mind who is trying to decide whether or not to buy this book.BUY IT!!!!!! You will not regret it."
4,Good Book,As I started to unravel this book I found the views slightly prejudice. How they dealt with the issues eg.Novalee constantly giving reference that she came from a trailer park. Now I believe that they are insinuating that this is the way 'Trailer Park' people are. That they are all run-down slobs eg.Willy Jack. The plot was intresting yet predictable. Overall a good read.
4,Where The Heart Is,"I think that Billie Letts title is truly what the book is about, HEART! I will never forget Novalee Nation and the courage she had when there was no where to turn. I had not read anything in a while, and this book has opened the door for me to be more interested in reading again. With this discovery, I have read even more wonderful books. Billie Letts is a talented writer and I hope more people will be interested enough to read more of her work!"
4,Laughing and crying go hand in hand while reading this book.,"A truly well written novel. I giggled and cried my way through this novel. Billie Letts creation of Novalee Nation is wonderful. I think we might all have a bit of Novalee in us, or wish we had. I caution you about reading this novel in a public place, as it pushes a full range of emotions to the surface with each turn of a page."
1,Don't waste your time,"As a college student, I spend my time reading and writing papers for four English classes. I was relieved when Winter Break came around and I had enough time to read a book of my choice. I chose Where the Heart Is because one day as I was channel surfing, I saw a recommendation for it on Oprah. I was persuaded to read it because I was so impressed with She's Come Undone, that I hoped that it would be its equal. Imagine my disappointment as I read this book and waited for something exciting to happen, it never did. I can't believe that I wasted my time and money on this flop. Maybe during Spring Break, I'll rent some movies instead."
1,Too bad Oprah revived this one,"I read this book before all the Oprah-driven hype. I found it disgusting. Imagine my shock when Oprah performed CPR on it and caused it to be reissued. Why would anyone want to write about degenerate behavior, and why would anyone else want to read it? I gave up on it. This is not a subject for entertainment. Too bad this book was not allowed to fizzle into well-deserved obscurity. It reads like a script for a bad made-for-TV movie. Oprah, we deserve better. And could we please have an option on this rating system for zero stars?"
1,"Very thin, simple book with no plot or character development",I found this book to be very thin in character development and kept waiting for the plot to thicken--it never did. Kind of felt duped when I finished. Characters were rather depressing and had ridiculous names.
1,Lifeless,"The only reason I finished reading this book was because it was an easy read and I knew it would only cost me another hour or so. It was a lifeless book, with kooky characters thrown in to make it interesting, but one never gets a good sense of who they are and everything stays very much on the surface and extremely predictable. It was a serious disapointment, even for a book that I had expected to be fluffy."
1,"Wouldn,t Recommend It","This book feels like fiction.Novalee is the most unreal of any of the characters.The plot moves along without me caring about her, because she continues to sound like a paper figure. The other characters are better drawn. Also I'm offended by the child rape scene. Why does Ophra often pick books with horrible things happening in them? Skip this book and don't look forward to the movie."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. It was billed as a ""funny"" read...I saw NOTHING funny about a small child being subjected to sodomy. As for the rest of the book... the transitions were sloppy, jumping months or years without a hint until the middle of the next paragraph, the characters were cute but not believable. And the character's names? I only bought it because the previous selection, Midwives, was excellent. This was not. I have half a mind to send Oprah a bill for my purchase price! HAHAHA"
1,The book speaks for itself.,"An economic cop out. ""Where the Heart Is"" gave up any chance for lasting impressions on society when it traded thought for readers. It becomes evidence for proof of Marxism as philosophy and feeling fall victim to money. I was disapointed."
3,"Just ""OK""","I read this book years ago and was surprised to see Oprah choose it for her Holiday book.The story was sweet and well written for what it was. It is the kind of book that is nice to read on a chilly Sunday afternoon when you have nothing else to do. There is certainly nothing much to learn from it, and you very likely will not feel ""changed"" by the experience of reading it, but for a first attempt at a novel I think it was good. I'd compare it to Anne Patchett's Patron Saint of Liars, Anne Tyler's Saint Maybe..."
5,Great Book!! Wonderful writing and a good story.,"Billie's use of words creates a world which is accessible by almost everyone who has the great pleasure of opening it and entering the world of Novalee. I remember the beginning of this book, and a wonderful dinner party whree Billie shared her story of a young woman enduring what so many young women do. Now, to see it not only published, but also award winning show that dreams come true. The book speaks to the young and old alike. It is a book daughters and mothers can share. Make it part of your Christmas list if you have any young women on your shopping list. They'll enjoy the book and the wisdom held within."
5,Hard to put down!,This story is captivating from the start! I finished it in about 3 or 4 days! Novalee is such an amazing person and Billie Letts really makes you feel as though you're in the story. You're able to relate to Novalee and feel the same emotions as she is experiencing! I'd recommend this book to anyone!
4,Where the Heart IS,"A great book that you can easily become addicted to. A very light read, but very real characters that you can't help root for."
5,LOVED IT!!!!,"I absolutely LOVED this book! I can't even tell you how many times I have read this book!The characters are awesome and reading about them makes me want to meet them. They are all so fun-loving and they seem like really great people!After reading the book, I bought the movie and the movie doesn't do justice to how incredibly great this book was!Everyone should read this book, it teaches you about life and how you shouldn't take things for granted! Again, AWESOME book!"
1,Bad editing!,"I was very disappointed. The idea of a girl living in a Wal-Mart was interesting, but that is all about this book. Letts should have developed and integrated the plots if she intended to make the story longer than she had thought at first. It's not ""twists and turns"" as she said, but rather adding ideas repeatedly. I wonder what the editor was doing. I think the biggest weakness of this book is it didn't have good editor."
1,This person paid Oprah to recommend this book,"I just want to know how much Billie Letts paid Oprah to suggest this book. It's dull, boring, and the plot leaves way too much to be desired. In many parts, the story dragged. Hey Oprah, get some sort of clue in the future. Heck, with our luck, this will be your next movie. I think it's time to terminate the Oprah Book Club!"
2,Couldn't get past the stupid names.,"One of Oprah's book club books I read and decided if she recommended it, I would either hate it or just tolerate it. It was really a shame, though, because the book could have been edited and been a good one. I loved the part of the plot where the main character lives in Wal-mart. Haven't we all thought about what it would be like to be left in a store at night after it closed? What would we eat? Where would we sleep? Where would we hide?PLEASE REWRITE!"
2,Hit by the club,"I will no longer be reading books on the mere basis of them being from Oprah's book Club. I, for one, am disturbed by graphic images of children being raped or molested which seems to be an ongoing theme in these books. (Why did none of the other reviews mention this)? I did not ""love"" any of the characters, nor did I find them to be very realistic...except for Novalee's best friend, Lexie, who's lack of discretion and protectiveness where her children are concerned, and promiscuity contributes to what is wrong with the world today."
2,This is too corny to be believed,"I simply cannot believe that the American publishing world would fall for this kind of inane levity. Every character/plot device has just been repolished and repackaged from a poor variety of films, tv shows and novels. As far as reality goes, I am not sure whether a girl of 17 would have acted as wisely as Novalee did."
2,Weak...but can pass as a beach novel,"It started out spellbinding and caught my attention from the get go. Young, pregnant girl- abandoned- and living in secret in a Walmart store where she's been dumped by her crumb of a boyfriend. (Admit it, isn't is a great fantasy to think of living in a store and getting to use all the merchandise at your leisure when no one is looking?). And then it got silly. Totally unrealistic. A little too predictable. Some authors can carry off nutty characters but Billie Letts didn't convince me with the people in this story. Novalee Nation is just a little too perfect in her abandonment. Just a little too wounded. The ending is pat and contrived. And then they went ahead and made a movie about this book? I heard that it, too, was pure drivel. Skip it unless it's the only book left in the doctor's office waiting room."
2,disappointing,"I wish I had read some of the customer reviews before I bought this book. The beginning was interesting and caught my attention. However, as the storyline progressed, it got too overly dramatic. The symbolism and ""deep"" meanings were more cheesy than interesting."
4,heart,"Where the Heart IsBillie LettsPublished by Warner BooksCopyright 1995""Heart""Where the Heart Is, is a truly heart warming story. The characters are all wise with all the love a person needs. Novalee was abandon at Wal-Mart, seven months pregnant, with no one and on where to go. The people treat her with compassion that she has never known. They are always there no matter what. There are life-changing morals in this novel, you just need to look closely. There was nothing about this book I didn't like. It has wisdom, comedy, tragedy, romance, and much more. The characters seem as though they are real, they act as any real human. Billie Letts really makes them come alive. The events are every day things that happen to every day people. I think all people would like this book. Although I do believe that this book is more aimed towards females. All in all this is a inspiring novel."
5,Excellent,"Excellent. The movie was good also! Her other book, the Honk and Holler, was really great also!!"
4,terrific read!,"I picked this book up for 3.00 at [other store]. I figured for 3.00 how bad could it be? Not bad at all. I was wary because the movie looked overly sappy and retarded, the book is none of those things. This is a fantastic read, all at once funny and heartbreakingly sad. The main character, Novalee Nation is a strong and proud heroine. This is a terrific beach read (or a saturday afternoon find!)"
4,A Fun and Easy Read,If you are looking for a delightful read this book is for you. It holds interest without making the reader work hard to understand the plot. It provokes interest in its characters. You find yourself rooting for most of them. It has heart and provides some hope for humanity.
3,I was expecting more...,I got the book thinking it would be quite a read but I read the first chapter and was not impressed. I finished the book hoping it would get better as I read on but it never really did.
4,I saw the movie before I read the book...,"I admit it... I saw the movie before I read the book, but the movie was sooo good I had to read the book... The book is exceptional, but the movie is great! I loved the characters, and the novel was written very well... and it's an easy read... I read it without thinking ""I have to hurry and get to the end"" it's a very mellow novel and I just took my time reading it... I think alot of readers need to read this book, just to relax and not be too anxious to finish it..."
3,"overall, very enjoyable","I read this book in long, delightful stretches...I couldn't put it down! And when I finished, I felt like I had lost a part of my life. It really pulls you in and even though some of the characters are little bit eccentric (even so far as implausible), the meaning of the book will make you appreciate your home. Although I think some of the book is a little unnecessarily graphic, on the whole the book is very enjoyable and very sentimental. Billie Letts deserves praise."
5,A top-notch book,"I have read tons of books but none quite like this one. It set the plot in the very beginning of the story and it didn't make you wait. Then the story began to unfold...a story about an innocent girl left with a baby to care for and no home. This book was a wonderful read. Though the book was very thick, I finished it in two nights, bringing it wherever I went. I definitely recommend this book and hope that other people will be able to experience the thrill of reading such an entertaining book."
5,good book,"""Where The Heart Is"" is a book for young and old alike to read and enjoy. I first saw the movie and was interested in reading the book. I am telling you, they both are great! The book and the movie have the main character as a 17-year-old girl pregnant, and a not so faithful boyfriend. Some people can realte to her. He dumps her off at a WalMart and she then must start herself a new life. She meets a wonderful woman named Sister Husband who takes her in when she need the help most. In the time she is here, she falls in love with the librarians brother, Forney. It has a love story and a struggle story in one. This book has inspired me and let me know that there ARE people, even though in books, that will help people out when they need it most. This was an inspiration book and I relly think you will enjoy reading this as well"
5,excellent read..,Within the first two pages I was captured. I enjoyed reading about all of the characters that were involved with the main heroine. I enjoyed seeing Novalee develope as a person and I enjoyed seeing how her life affected so many others. I loved this book it made me feel good.
2,One too many tradgedies,"In seven years Novalee experienced homelessness, having a baby inside a Wal-Mart, death of friends, kidnapping, rape of children, near death of her best friend by an abusive boyfriend, a tornado that made her homeless again. We thought the author had a wonderful story to tell about a sweet girl trapped by poverty and circumstances. But she was unsure of how to best convey the emotional weight of that and so she produced almost endless tragedies to tug at your heartstrings. Wal-Mart was almost saintly in this book. It came across to us, as an advertisement for a store that the author knew would sell a lot of her books."
3,An okay read lifted by an incredibly likeable heroine.,"The thing that struck me first after finishing Where The Heart Is is that this is a story told by a brilliant storyteller not a brilliant writer. The book is amateuish and labours in parts but it tells a story that at its heart is utterly moving. An extraordinary main character, Novalee Nation, pushes you to read on and guides you through the trials and tribulations that she encounters. The storyline on occasion stretches credibility but you are so endeared to Novalee that you just want to make sure that she ends up okay. I perhaps liked this more than I should have, but if you're after a nice, light easy read for a weekend away or even a weekend in, Where The Heart Is I'm sure you will find is just right!"
2,mildy amusing but inaccurate,"The book was amusing no doubt, but I grew up in Oklahoma and now live in New Mexico. I found the characters missing the feel of these two great places. I've been to Santa Rosa many times and have never even seen a mosquito...NM is not known for their mosquitos...The choice names of the characters was a classic case of an author going ""over the top."" Why wasn't the indian boy from one of the five great tribes of Oklahoma instead of a tribe no one has ever heard of. Finally, does anyone out there believe that Sam Walton would uphold a 17 yr old pregnant teenage mother??? One last thing that really bothered me. Novalee won a Southwest photography contest. No one that I know thinks of Oklahoma as being in the southwest. Small annoyances; i admit. They are so numerous that they distract from the story."
3,"A Good read, but not a Great one","Billie Letts has a talent authentic description of small town life, but her characters are a little less convincing. I do believe that people who are as stupidly trusting as Novalee exist, but it's a stretch to believe that she comes out OK with the help of her quirky aquaintences. Her first day around the Wal-Mart meeting strange but super-friendly people sounds like something out a of Sesame Street plot, and the events that take place in the book were interesting enough to keep my attention if not gain my respect for Letts' sense of realistic fiction. What exactly is she trying to say? That things work out for those who are pure of spirit and trusting as sheep? I hope not. I was entertained, to say the most, but I more liked Letts' book 'Honk and Holler Opening Soon'. Another small-town novel about gritty, quirky people who are a little more real with sin. That book didn't make the Oprah list, but it should have."
4,Good things come to good people!,"What a wonderful story. The success of the human spirit. And what a charming commentary and the affection of a small town toward an outsider. We all need a place to call home, don't we?"
5,This was a wonderful heart warming tale about love and life.,"I loved this book. I thought it was nice to read a book about wonderful people doing great things. This book was very uplifting. The characters became like a family to me while I was reading the book. They showed the heart warming side of society, in a time where most people in the world are concerned about themsleves. It is nice to know that there are places, where people will put aside their own comforts to help those in need. This book provides a wonderful opportunity for every one, to stop and check ""where their heart is""."
3,quick read,"Even though I found this a quick read ,I felt it pulled at every emotion possible. However the story line was almost at times predictable. I enjoyed this authors work."
4,Drama is around every corner,"""Where the Heart Is"" is a pleasant novel that always keeps you wanting to read more.This book has a combination of;love,tragedy,humor,death,and success all in one book.The reading is very easy to keep up with, so having a dictionary near by is not required.I'm not an avid reader, but after reading this book I have gained interest in reading for pleasure and not just for assignments."
5,"Great Book,l couldnt put it down!",This was the best book I have read in a long time. It is a very simple read and it is hard to put down. The story itself is very heartfelt. I laughed and cried with every chapter.I did not want the story to end and I cant wait to read Billie Letts next book. It is on my Christmas wish list!
4,A very easy book to read.,"I really like this book. I read it for my English class in South Western College, and I really enjoy it. I think it was a very easy book to read. If you want to read something interesting and you're undecided, try ""Where The Heart Is"" I recommended to you."
4,Heart-warming. It's okay to fall for its charm.,"This book was a purely enjoyable read. I was bummed when I finished it because I looked forward to reading a few chapters every night. I must agree that it does exude a Forrest Gumpish optimism, but I don't see anything worng with that--in fact, I find it refreshing. The characters are charming and the story is heartwarming."
5,EXCELLENT!!EXCITING!!PAGE TURNING!!!,This is the first Billie Letts book for me and I thought it was excellent. You have to keep reading because you want to know what happens next. Novalee was great. And the nice people she met (only in small towns) I also thought Americus was amusing.
5,satisfying read; the movie does the book justice,"You can't help but root for the main character. The story seems farfetched and straight out of National Enquirer: ""Teenager hides out in Walmart, then has baby!"". But these days, it pales in comparison to real life events.I loved the character who takes her in and becomes a surrogate mother. Her love interest is a more complicated character and not as easy to love. The most grueling part of the book is reading about her downtrodden friend and the relationships she winds up in. The book draws to a happy conclusion and you feel there is justice in the world."
2,I was tricked!,"The story was going along fine, just fine and then the author delved into explicit child molestation tabloidism. Why? There are already too many stories about women and children being brutalized. I thought this would be different but I was tricked!"
2,"Flat, paper thin, one dimensional characters",This book struck me as being cliched from beginning to end...there was nothing clever or intriguing about the plot...it was all so obvious what was going to happen. The characters were painted were incredibly thin and utterly one dimensional.This is not my idea of worthwhile work.
3,"Fun, but unreal","I enjoyed this book, despite its lack of realism. If I were 17, 7 months pregnant and dumped by my loser boyfriend at a Walmart in a strange town, the last thing on my mind would be getting philisophical with strangers and snapping polaroids. If I were handed a ""good luck charm"" and were told to make a wish, I wouldn't be wishing for a tree under those circumstances, either. I am sure this book was not meant to be realistic, but that kind of threw me off enjoying the book at first. If you keep in mind that it is just a fiction, you will find yourself enjoying this novel. Not bad for a first publication."
2,"Although I liked the main character, the pacing was choppy.","This book started off great. I really liked the main character, and the way she took up residence in the Wall Mart. But I didn't like the way she integrated the story of the ""bad"" boyfriend and the ""good"" girl. It was so choppy. Then she threw in a rape scene - wow! I just didn't buy it - that's been so over-used to get the ""Bad Man"" idea across. Most of the men here are either jerks or wierd. I'm so sick of ""Oprah"" books!!!"
3,Sweet as Ice Cream,"In her book Where the Heart Is Billie Letts takes her reader to the heartland of America where people with names like Novalee Nation, Sister Husband Moses Whitecotton live simply, care deeply and love completely. Letts takes us out of the cornfield and into the lives of characters with problems that seem insurmountable. Books like Where the Heart Is have a place on America's library shelves to remind us that the country is made up of people who struggle against great odds to realize their hopes and dreams while discovering their God-given talents. Though not meaty enough for adult discussion groups, Where the Heart Is is a wonderful book for teens and young adults. Gail Lowe, Author of Former Things"
5,Uplifting!,"I loved this book! This is a feel good story about a young girl who has nobody in the world who gives a hoot about her and the wonderfully eclectic group of characters (multiracial too) who come into her life. It is through both the kindness of these strangers and the love for her new baby that Novalee sees for the first time that life can be wonderful. Hurray for Billy Letts who believes strongly enough that there are still good people in America and that she chose to write about them. On that note, I believe Sam Walton would have given her a lot more money!"
5,Someone Please Help Me!,I just have a really quick question. I have been led to believe that this book and movie is based on a true story. Is this a fact or have I been mislead? Email me at tiggeracm@hotmail.com and help me think clearly. Thank you much!!
4,"Hi, I enjoy Cheese!!","I really enjoyed this book,I think all children (older than 7)should all least try to read this book. The book is about a young,caring,17-year-old girl, about to have a baby,when her rude,selfish,mean boyfriend dumps her off at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma.After she has her baby, she lives with a woman named Sister.But, thats all I'll tell you! Buy the book so you can enjoy this page-turning book!"
4,A quick read!,"This book was much better than the movie!! It definately wasn't a life changing book, but it was a fun and enjoyable book. If you want to escape your life for a weekend, read this book!"
4,The Heart Shines,"I never heard of the novel before watching the movie - In fact, I just happened upon the book in the bookstore and was surprised the movie was based on a novel.I like the issues the book deals with - Teen pregnancy as the highlight, of course. I have known young women who have gotten pregnant and left school, some giving their children up and others working as single moms.I think Novalee is a good example of how one can continue on and be successful despite early unplanned childbirth and no support from the father. Sure, she makes a lot of mistakes but she grows, and in the end you see that she is a stronger person."
4,Home is where the heart is,This book is a great novel. It is different from the movie so if you are reading the book in class I am warning you now. I am glad that we had this book on our reading list. (Junior in high school.) In this book you will do a lot of analiyzing and thinking. (You might want to think about geralizations and stereotypes.)
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,"THIS BOOK KEEPS HUMMING ALONG. A VERY EASY READ. I WAS SORRY IT ENDED. A ""FEEL-GOOD"" BOOK WHERE THINGS WORK OUT WELL FOR ALMOST EVERYONE (NOT QUITE LIKE THE REAL WORLD, BUT THAT'S WHY I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH). KEEP THEM COMING, AND I WILL KEEP READING!"
3,Jumps around too much,"I enjoyed this book, but felt that it skipped over too many parts. For example, I wanted to know more about what happened in Walmart. It seemed as if we were about to be shown this and suddenly, next chapter, it's several months later.The book reminded me of a novel version of a Chicken Soup for the Soul book. It's heartwarming to a point, but then it begins to seem unrealistic."
4,"Somewhat implausible, but one of best I've read in a while","I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I'm a 17-year old writer who is a very picky reader, so you'd think that I would put this book about a girl living in a Wal-Mart (I mean, come on, right?) down after reading three chapters...but I didn't. I became so captivated by Novalee and Moses and Forney and Sister Husband that I couldn't let go. Ms. Letts has written a wonderfully readable story with those rare characters that stay with you long after you've finished the book. (Could I write for the book jackets, or what?) I also found myself falling completely in love with Forney. His love for Novalee was such a pleasure to read about, as it's rare that you find characters--or real people, for that matter!--who can love quite like that. The fact that Novalee was willing to give him up for a better life was so romantic and so RIGHT...I'm gonna stop before I swoon to death. To sum up in five words or less: Great book. Read it."
4,A one day reader,"This book is a light hearted one day reader...and I really needed that. If you are looking for a book to get you through a flight, night or weekend...this is it. It is very funny and the characters are interesting and well thought out. I was impressed with the wit and style of the author. Ms. Lett kept me laughing and wanting to share every chapter with someone. Very down-home."
3,"Easy to read, jewel, rewarding, simple","Billie Letts allows us to share a little bit of the central south west with warm and loving characters. I enjoyed the names of all the characters and their flaws. I would have liked a little more description and connection to the character's love of gardening that comes up in the begining is over-shadowed by her new found love for photography. As stated this is an easy book to read and beneficial for womens book-clubs with discussion reflecting on women's role in community, etc."
5,Really great storytelling,Best I've read in a long time - beautiful story - beautifully written. Thank you Ms.Letts.
4,Where The Heart Is,"How would you like to have a baby in a walmart? It just so happens that a seventeen year old girl named Novalee had that happen to her. After six weeks of struggle and pain she had her first child Americus. She then begins to learn what a real family is and meeets some heartwarming friends that help her. They give her food,money, and shelter. They all come together in the little town and become a loving family. Mr. Forney one of her really good friends and librarian of the town helps her in a unique way. He gives her books every few weeks to read and learn stuff to help her through life. Throughout her tough weeks by herself she finds ways to survive. Will she make it for the rest of her life? Will she ever leave the town? Where will she be in years to come."
3,Why Ruin A Good Beginning?,"The beginning of this books was sweet,engaging, and sad. I like the main character even if she was a little underdeveloped but this wasn't enough to carry the book through to the end. Somewhere after Americus was born, the author and I,both lost interest in the book. It seemed as though the author ran out of things to say and the story fell flat. I remember the early parts of the book fondly but as for the bottom 1/3, I have only one word--rewrite. I gave it three stars because this book shows a lot of potential and there are quite a few good moments just not enough to make it a great book. Its an easy read and if you have the time, pick it up but don't expect bells and whistles."
3,Critacl review of Where The Heart Is,"I read this book in 2 days. I came away a bit disappointed, not satisfied with the ending. At Times however I was on the edge of my chair, and couldn't read fast enough. I did see at the end of the book that it is recommended as a teen novel, and I do not think that all of the content is suitable for that age group. Graphic at times with material that I thought was quite violent. If you are looking for a fast read, this is the book for you."
4,A refreshing read,"Novalee Nation, 17, was left at Wal-Mart with $7.77 to her name. The #7 is one bad number for her, her luck gets worse before it gets better. Novelee lives in the Wal-Mart constantly keeping track on what she eats, wears, and borrows from the store. This story is a very light-hearted story about struggle and surviving. It is about a neighborhood who embraces this young woman and her child (who was in born in Wal-Mart) into their lives. They give her a place to live, food, and anything else that she needs. She becomes a star based on her childs birth and comes to love the small town that she will begin to call home.This book is absolutely wonderful and so refreshing. It sends the true message of giving from the heart. I think anyone who reads this book will enjoy it."
2,"lame, weak, lame, weak, lame, weak","I was sorely disappointed.I had been a devout Oprah follower up until this point. I loved SONG OF SOLOMON, BELOVED and SHE's COME UNDONE.But WHERE THE HEART IS does not appeal to the same crowd.I have to agree with an earlier reviewer about the names. Americus Nation!!!!! I mean, come on!!Over all, the book is very contrived."
3,Not that great--not recommended.,"Billie Letts has a great writing style. She really drew me in and made me want to read ""just one more chapter"" to see how the story was going to play out for the most part.Where this Author left me cold is the characters. They were just too unlikeable for me. The author just got me interested in the characters but I didn't feel warm and fuzzy where the characters are concerned. I didn't really root for them like I do when I read other books.Also, the outcome was pretty predictable.Most books that I love I will give to my mom and I enthusiastically wait until she has it read so we can talk about it. This one I will not be passing on. I am a little surprised by how well this book was reviewed."
2,What can I say?,"I heard such great things about this book, so I decided to check it out. A quarter of the way through the book, I realized I was still waiting to get into it. It was not boring, but it sure was not exciting. But, what can I say, I finished it!"
1,A Sunday School Tract Disguised as a novel,"Reads like a 19th century Sunday school pamphlet. The cloyingly and unrealistically good heroine, unmarked by her brutal childhood, gives birth to the perfect child and ends up with a nurturing Prince Charming. But look out if you are one of those who did Novalee wrong or if you sleep with a handsome stranger -- you'll end up disfigured, crippled, or sodomized! The author presents one ""lovable"" eccentric after another but I was not charmed. I especially disliked it that the African American characters are throwbacks to the old Mammy stereotypes -- their own child is gone to free them to care for the little White princess."
1,BORING!,"""Where the Heart Is"" was not a great book. I didn't like it very much for a number of reasons. The thing that bugged me more than anything else was the language. Whenever the character Willy Jack was involved, there was an unreasonable amount of vulgarity. A close second were the character descriptions. Billie Letts did a wonderful job describing the scenery, but she tended to forget about the characters. She only described characters when speaking about their deformities. When I read a book, I like to be able to picture the characters. As far as hair, eye color, and skin tone are concerned, there was very little description. When she did describe them, she did it without motivation. Altogether, the book was very boring."
5,Can put this down!,"Where the heart is an awesome book. This is one of the most heart touching books I have ever read. It is on of those books that you just can't put down! 17 year old girl Novelee Nation pregnant and all left all alone at Wal-Mart with $7.77. She was on her way to California with her boyfriend when he left her there on her own. She has her baby in the Wal-Mart after living in the Wal-Mart for awhile. Forney the town librarian helps Novelee get to the hospital when she is in labor. Novelee then becomes famous from living in the Wal-Mart. Novelee overcomes one obstacle after another,but she never gives up! This book is a very easy read. The whole family can enjoy it!"
5,Where the Heat is...,"Reading is not one of my favorite hobbies in the least, but when when i was forced to read this by one of my friends, I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! I loved ""Where the heart is"". I felt like I could really relate to Novalee, she always looked for the brighter side of things. Poor Novalee was given all sorts of obstacales to make her road through life more bumpy, but she defeated her unlucky sevens with the help of her friends and new-found family. I loved that everyone she met throughout the booked helped her to acheive a differnt aspect of life. When it happens in real life, we don't tend to notice what a huge change the smallest detail can effect our life. This book said that there truly is a silver lining to every stormy cloud."
5,"I read this book, before I saw the movie! (It is GOOD)","I read the book Where The Heart Is, and I haven't seen the movie yet. I thought the book was a real good written book. I couldn't put it down. The characters in the book were so real. I can't wait to see the movie."
3,VERY light reading!,"This a very sweet book...a little too sweet. In fact, the violent scenes seem oddly out of place. They don't quite fit, like another person wrote those parts of the book. Overall it was very ""soap-operaish"" , predictable and emotionally manipulative. If you're a fan of Danielle Steele or sappy romance novels you'll like thsi book."
1,Did I read the same book?,"While I will not criticize Ms. Letts' writing style or ability; because of the content I must say that this was the absolute, most horrid book I have EVER read. It made me physically ill and I didn't even finish it. I realize life isn't always pretty, and that bad things happen to people all the time, but please, this book should have come with a warning label! I'm sure it would serve well as a Cautionary-tale for Single Mothers Prone to Dating, but shame, shame on Oprah, Billie Letts, and the publisher for not warning the rest of us of the graphic, sickening nature of this allegedly ""heartwarming"" story. Quite disturbing."
5,Very nice,"I agree with the recent reviewer who said that Billie Letts' novels are very simplistic, and predictable, and the characters aren't developed too well...but that didn't keep me from loving every minute of them! They're funny and sweet and they say that you can drag your life out of the gutter and make it something beautiful. Who says a novel needs to be any deeper than that?"
2,Typical Oprah's book club,This book is typical of Oprah's book club. Oprah picks books of people who have everything going wrong for them and then they somehow rise above it. This is another such story and I'm getting tired of them. Enough with the soul searching novels with happy endings.
5,Where the Heart Is,"Heart warming. Simple reading. Demonstrates the strength and strength of a young, single mother and her struggles through surviving. Demonstrates the love of a village to help raise a child."
2,Childishly written OK story.,"I have not yet finished reading this book but I've come over half way. The first thing that struck me is that it is not very professionally written I deem it to be written in a pretty childish way and it only makes me feel anyone can get away with producing a successful book. The story line and the characters are both incredible.The book I guess has a positive message: Anyone can make this world a better place in their own little way, (but with a lot of incredible luck and help from others!).I have read a lot of books the past half year and though this is an easy read it is the ""cheapest"" story I've read yet."
2,"Velveta thought cheesy, is sometimes just what you want.","Billie Letts novel of a remakable girl defying the odds and leading an upstanding life can at times be maddeningly sterotypical and honey-sweet, but beneath that tells a story of a girl who works extremely hard to achieve her goals inspite of what seem like insermountable set backs. My copy contained a Q & A with the writers which helped me gain a much better and deeper understanding of the book and its charachters."
4,Couldn't put it down.,"I was on a marathon of Agatha Christie books when I turned to Billy Letts. I had wanted to see the movie, so when I saw it in the bookstore I bought (not even realizing it was an Oprah book club selection). The book captured my interest from page one. It was a nice change of pace from Christie and I just never wanted to put it down. While a stream of bad luck follows Novalee (sometime a bit unrealistic) she nevertheless pulls through it and makes a success of her life. I didn't really care for the ending...I expected more...or maybe I just didn't want it to be over."
3,Easy read not just for girls...,"Contrary to belief, this is not a ""chick-book."" Being a 26 year old guy, I enjoyed this book. There's nothing earth-shattering about it and it IS quite an easy read. I would have liked to have seen the relationship between Forney and Novalee explored and developed a little bit further.They only real trouble I had with the book was the flipping back and forth between Novalee's story and Willy Jack's story. Novalee's was interesting, but Willy Jack's was a bit boring and really didn't add anything to it.If you're looking for an easy to pass away the weekend, then this is your book. It's pleasant, enjoyable and worth a day or two. And it's not just for women to enjoy."
4,Good Book,"Where The Heart Is is a wonderful book with great, colorful characters. The novel leads you on an exciting journey through a young girls life and takes you through good times and bad. I would recomend it for young adults and teens."
4,It was entertaining,"Though this book was a tad bit predictable, it made you feel good when you finished it. It is just a classic story about a girl with a not so good life that finds that there are careing people out there, and you can turn your life around. It isn't heavy reading or anything, its just a book that you sit down with and read in a couple of days, and enjoy. I recommend this book to anyone who just wants a good story."
5,This book is life affirming.,"I expected the story of a small town unwed mother to be trite at best. Instead I found layers and layers of complexity about the human spirit. I will never look at an unwed mother with a bunch of kids in the same way - thanks to Lexie, an overweight woman with a passel of kids who befriended our heroine and helped her milk to flow - what a wonderful metaphor for the best people.Read this and feel connected."
2,mediocre at best,Why would I want to read about a 17 year old girl that makes bad decisions and the rest of her disfunctional friends? I can read about this in the newspaper on a daily basis. Ugh. Sorry I wasted my time on this one.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I didn't think i was going to care one bit about these characters, but they were totally fascinating. In fact, the longer I think about it after having finished the book, the more I liked it and the characters. Amazing that Novalee truly had hit bottom yet managed to make such a wonderful life for herself and her daughter...maybe good luck *is* all about attitude."
5,Excellant! Very down to earth!,"Dear Oprah, I have to admit that I had never read one of your book club books, but when I heard about this book from a co-worker of mine(which by chance we work for Wal-Mart in Humble, Tx) I had to read it. Normally, I am a semi-slow reader , but I finished this book in about three or four days. I couldn't put it down. I am currently reading another Oprah recommended reading, ""The Deep End Of The Ocean."" Keep up all of your great work, and I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks!!!!!!"
5,Renewed my long-forgotten love for fiction.,"When my husband was ill and my beloved grandmother was dying, this book offered me refuge and re-awakened my love for fiction. I have been reading non-stop in the seven months that have followed. Letts allowed me to forget the constant analysis that I had gotten accustomed to years before as an English major and teacher, and once again I could relax with a book. Her characters are so believable, her words so crisp. After months have passed, I think of this book daily. Thank you, Billie Letts!"
4,So Far It Has Been One Great Read,"So far the book, Where the Heart Is has been one great read! I haven't finished it just yet. (I only started it last night and am on page 265)Yet it has been one really great read!! I loved it, Billie Letts writes a very intriging story that keeps the reader compelled to find out what happend to Novalee and her daughter. The one flaw in the entire book was when she would keep refering back to Willie Jack. I know it was a tactic to divert our attention and keep us wanting to read more it, to me, made the book seem never-ending at times. All I wanted to know was what happens to Novalee and then we get Willie Jack the *----*. I couldn't care less about him! Well all I really have to say is GO GET THIS BOOK! OPRAH FINALLY CHOOSE A GREAT ONE!!"
2,Ok Text,This was a text book for one of my classes. I felt like it had a really difficult to navigate format and I felt that it lacked a lot of information.
3,"Nice thought, but outdated","I bought this book for a college class, and while it's packed with information, a lot of that information is outdated or debunked now. I would definitely be interested in a book by the same authors that was most up to date."
5,Great Look at Independent Baseball,"Mike Shannon does a great job of getting behind the scenes of the life of an umpire in the independent Frontier League. As a resident of a town that had a team in the FL for 8 years (1995-2002), it was an especially interesting read. What really surprised me was that the featured subject, umpire Max McLeary, was born and raised here in Johnstown. A fine book for those who love the minor leagues!"
5,An amazing book!,"The people giving this book low marks probably are the same people who would give William Burroughs low marks. This work stands with the best in experimental fiction. If you are interested in something that offers more than your tired boring mainstream fiction, definitely give it a try! Pure genius!"
1,Very Confusing,"I did not like this book at all. I guess this is suppose to be ""experimental"" but it just seems like Mr. Amerika (must be a nom de plume) is just goofing off and doesn't really know how to write readable fiction. Unreadable, I'm afraid, so skip it."
5,black currant oil,Been suffering from middle age hair loss and after a suggestion from the Dr Oz show to us this product I decided to try it. Within 2 wks my hair loss slowed down to normal. Would recommend trying it. Not too expensive
1,Blood Pressure Monitor,"We can't get it to work? I already threw away the box and don't know how to return it? Both my husband and I tried, don't know if it is defected?"
2,blood pressure monitor,I was unable to use this product (my hands were apparently not strong enough to blow up the bulb). I have returned it but have not yet received my refund.
1,Non-functioning OMRON Blood Pressure Monitor,"Through Amazon, I bought an OMRON Brand blood pressure monitor. It simply doesn't work. I tried repeatedly to get it to work. Then I took it to my Nurse Practictioner for help. She tried it several times and agreed with me that it doesn't work. What should I do?"
4,excellent BP machine,Very accurate and easy to use blood pressure machine for self-monitoring use. Included cuff is a bit small for average-bigger users. Portable. Handy self-turn-off.
4,"Seems good, wrong batteries",Just got this. It was easy to set up and seems to work well. But be advised that it takes AAA batteries not AA as stated in the description.
4,A doctor who advises this machine for patients,"I like this device-- it's very affordable and works well. I bought one to test and have been pleased with its accuracy and ease of use on myself and patients.In addition, it stores 14 readings so you can take it to the doctor and let him review your last 14.I think this is a must for anyone with borderline to high BP as they can easily test their own BP at home and avoid that ""white coat"" elevation that is common when the only readings are in the doctor's office.I recommend it highly."
1,Broken?,"I bought this for my mother 2 years ago and we haven't been able to make it work to-date. Even a medical doctor tried to use this after reading the instructions but it never worked. The pressure in the cuff decreases without making any measurement. Too bad, I needed this to work."
2,Disappointed,"This shipped in a timely fashion. It has large display numbers which make it easily read.It is easy to operate...especially if you read the directions and refer to them for error messages.However, I was very disappointed with this product. There was a large discrepency with my doctor'ssphygmomanometer; the discrepency increased with time. For a reliable reading, I would not recommendthis unit."
2,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with this product because my mother, who is a nurse, has compared the measuremets of this item with the manual blood pressure machien she has are so different. We do not have a way to calibrate it or adjust it based onthe device and on a letter the company sent me to my e-mail address. Therefore, we can't trust it and it has been wated money so far unless somebody help us with something we haven't done. Then, the purpose of helping my brother keep a record of his blood pressure before he goes to the doctor has been lost."
3,HEM-432C,"Easy to operate, simple to read; it was recommended by my Doctor. The unit will average 3 tests taken within ten minutes of each other. BUT, there are some inconsistent readings between all three readings, one can be 140/90 the last one 128/80. Not very accurate if you were to ask me."
3,Not what I had expected,"This is an inexpensive blood pressure monitor and I like the idea of the manual pump, but it does not always work and than you have to re-pump which is a waste of time and energy. We have used it everyday for 6 months and the readings are reliable. We have not had to change the batteries..All in all I got what I paid for, if I had to do it over again I would invest a little more and get a better monitor."
4,Great little device!,This is well worth your money. It's a little bulky in size and the hoses are a bit short. But it does work fine.
1,Junk,"System is not properly calibrated. Readings are always high as tried with several people with normal pressure. Can not return to the vendor once open. Manufacturer will look at it if you pay shipping to and back, which is about $10.00. Will not replace the item even if defective.I just bought a piece of junk."
1,not accurate at all,"just a toy, I become high blood pressure by the fluctuated readings, in my doctor office my reading is 122/80, with this I got readings from 160/95 to 135/80. The price is cheap so I didn't bother to return it. Don't waste your money like me."
1,Machine does not work,I have bought this machine but I have got no service from it. It has not worked. It powers up but when I attempt to take a reading only one figure appears on the screen. It just does not work. I am sending it back to the merchant. In view of this I can not give the product a rating.
5,great product,Myself and my husband use this..we checked these reading with another bp apparatus...and the results were the same...i think there must be some bad lemons out there...but ours worked well.
4,Manual Inflation BP monitor is better than automatic ones,I use it couple times everyday.It is very reliable and useful.
2,Omron HEM 432CN manual blood pressure monitor,The blood pressure reading is 15 - 20 points higher than normal for myself and my wife.
3,Questionable operation and results,"Thought this would be good to have as my BP is slightly elevated and my doctor told me to keep an eye on it. First, it doesn't always turn on, you have to turn it on and off several times to get it to stay on. When it's finally ready everything seems fine except the reading is way off from what my doctor results are, by 15 or more points! Can't really depend on it to be accurate. Have taken three readings five minutes apart and the results are significantly different. So much so that if I could believe the readings my heart is on the verge of bursting! It's more of a novelty than a medical tool."
1,Oron HEM-432C is a bad product,This product is awful. Repeatedly registers error. An important health device in our hjouse but completely unreliable. I would like to return it and buy a similar device that works
4,Great simple tool,"This is an easy to use and simple way to keep track of my blood pressure. I have thrown away 3 other competing products because they were unreliable or inaccurate. Omron was recommended as a brand by my doctor. I have not checked its accuracy yet, but it appears to be consistent so far."
4,Great Product!!!,"I've been monitoring my BP at home for many years now, taking it 1x a week. I started to realize my old machine was just that - old! Was it taking accurate readings? Even when I was taking a few in a row they seem to be 'all over the place' which led me to believe it had done it's time and I needed a new one.I didn't want to purchase one off the shelf at a local retailer not knowing anything about the product itself. I did my homework and found this system was one of the best for its fair dollar. It has a memory system, it gives you specific instructions on how to best take your BP. The manual is an easy, quick read and it makes sense. They don't try to overwhelm you.I love this system. Not a fan of having to take my home BP once a week but if it keeps me at bay from being on medicine and I get personal attention from my doc in monitoring my home readings, great. I will definitely by this machine again."
2,Cheap machine,"The monitor is a cheaply built machine. All other monitors I've had male plugs on the ends of the tubes to the bulb and the arm cuff to be inserted into openings in the body of the machine. This has nothing on the ends of the tubes; they are to be pushed over two nipples on the case and held there by the power of faith. Not only do the tubes leak, causing many error readings, but they fall off when the cuff is unstrapped. Machine sells for a good price but isn't even worth that."
1,Waste Of Money!!!,I give this item a big ole thumbs down! It does not give a reading after numerous attempts of squeezing the hand ball. I returned it for a refund. I should have been more cautious from reading the negative customer comments who had similiar experiences.
1,Disappointed in this product!!!,"I also have a BP760 7 unit.Do yourself a favor and purchase the BP760 7,it is worth spending the extra $25.00.You get what you pay for!!"
5,very good,very good product easy to use very accurate and good looking i like it and my dad like it best
2,Difficult to pump,I ended up returning this. I had difficulty pumping the rubber ball. It is useless to me. Consider checking out the product at Bed Bath and Beyond before making a blood pressure monitor.
2,BP meter,i wouldnt suggest this product...its very clunky and also very slow. i am not a medical person nor used this types of products much. i some how did not like this..
2,Not Showing Accurate Results,The difference between the readings from two different times(within one hour) is too much (i-e 15).
3,"OK, but I would prefer a manual release.","I haven't used this monitor very much, but it appears to take quite a long time to release, and I prefer the manual release models."
2,This Blood Pressure Monitor doesn't help,"Unit was returned because its readings were excessively high. The Omron Monitor was taken to the doctor's office and used by their nurse. It readings were compared against reading's immediately obtained by the nurse with the doctor's blood own pressure gauge. The systolic pressure was 26 points higher with the Omron unit and the dyastolic was 6 points higher. Otherwise, its easy to set up and use."
2,Fussy & unpredictable,"After four months use, I find this monitor gives unpredictable systolic (upper number) readings, largely dependent on how much it's pumped up. It tends to be more repeatable with diastolic (lower) numbers. I can, for example, obtain a reading as high as 140/70 or as low as 106/67, purely by changing my pump-to start pressure. I would recommend another monitor."
2,Really hard to inflate,Wish I would have spent the extra money for the self-inflating model this one is really hard to inflate. Other than that no issues
5,Omron Hem-432C Manual inflation B/P Monitor,Works great and has a memory that holds B/P readings taken from the time I got it and holds for each doctor's appointments untill I delete it. I would definitely buy from this seller again. It is a regular size adult cuff.
2,I expected better,my previous experience with Omron blood pressure monitors led me to believe that this model would be as convenient to use as my old unit. I find my new unit cumbersome and inefficient.
5,Does the job,"I recently had some dental work done...........they took my blood pressure with a wrist unit.....it was way up! 150/100! I freaked! Then I read that the wrist units can be very unreliable, and after all, it was at the dental office. So I bought the real deal from Amazon, and discovered it wasn't as bad as I thought. The far more accurate reading is 134/86....still not perfect....gotta lose some weight.........but at least I know the reading is a real one."
5,Great Product for Great Price,"I got this for the simplicity of checking my own blood pressure, and using it's memory feature. I'm dealing with a few health issues, sending my bp a lot higher than normal for short periods of time. So I've seen it work correctly with high bp and normal bp. I get the same results (within about 3-5 points top and bottom numbers) with this model as I do with a standard bp cuff and stethoscope. I also compared it against itself, checking each arm multiple times, and it comes up with the same numbers within about 3 points (again, then I double checked it with a tradition bp taker, and it is right on). From what I see so far, this is a fantastic buy."
5,very pleased with item,THis is the first blood pressure monitor we got and I wasn't sure whether this would be adequate. I am very pleased with it and don't mind the manual inflation. keeping it simple saves me the trouble of replacing batteries for an air pump I don't need.
1,Difficult to use!,"The product description stated, ""Manual blood pressure monitor is the simplest way to take blood pressure readings at home."" So I did not get the self inflating model. I pump the bulb as stated in the directions (I follow the directions exactly). It takes many attempts before I get a reading. And I wait the required time before a new attempt. Even though I do exactly the same thing sometimes I get a EE (underinflated) and sometimes I get an E (overinflated). By the time I get a reading I don't know if I have high blood pressure because I have high blood pressure or because I am totally frustrated."
5,I like it,"I like it.. cheap - takes my blood pressure measurement.It's manual, you have to use the hand pump to inflate it, then wait for it to deflate and listen for your BP.It takes 4 AAA batteries, nice and small, it took my BP measurements consistentaly. I'm very happy with it.(generally about those machines, you want it to be quiet in the room.. if the tv is running or there's a kid screaming, you'll get wrong readings, there's a microphone in there that ""listens"" for your heart pulse)"
3,Omron BP machine,This is an accurate machine. Calibrated well. I checked it against 4 or 5 different machines both manual and automatic and the numbers were good. The only draw back is that you have to stay ABSOLUTELY STILL or you get an error message. You cannot even breathe too hard. But overall it is pretty reliable.
1,faulty product - bad customer service,Product did not work and when I contacted their customer service I was confronted with someone who did not know their product line and only suggestion was to buy a more expensive item in their product line. A typical bait and switch. Product was returned and I was penalized by Amazon receiving a credit of only $19.42 on a 22.99 purchase. Not a good transaction
5,Great Value,"I bought one of these off ebay. I was concerned that it did not come with an AC adapter and is powered by batteries. My fears have been quashed. The batteries last a long time. I don't think the extra cost for an adapter is worthwhile. For ease of use, accuracy and cost, the HEM 432C can't be beat. I would only recommend an ""automatic"" unit over this manual unit for those who for some reason can't squeeze an inflation bulb; or for a few added features. This is a great basic unit."
5,Very helpful,I bought it for my grandmother and she likes it. It is easy for her to use and for her to understand the readings.
2,B/P monitor gives no B/P reading,"I ordered this Manual B/P monitor because of my long familiarity with and long-time use of the mercury sphygmomanometer with its manual bulb for cuff inflation. I read the instructions carefully and followed them exactly. Although I tried many times, the machine never produced any read-out of my blood pressure. I first called Amazon, was referred to manufacturer who referred me to distributor. Result: no helpful advice and no refund at this date (long after the return)."
5,blood pressure monitor with memory,Exactly what I needed with a home blood pressure monitor. It's easy to use and keeps a history of the readings in its memory.
5,Fantastic Book about the MetaProcess and subordinate process,Scott's books (you should get More Process Patterns also) describe the processes necessary to provide lifecycle coverage to a software project. Scott's approach of reviewing the high level for strategic importance and then dive bombing in on the specific issue gives you the information you need to address your software projects. Scott's war stories give you the impression that he has worked on YOUR project. His insight is wonderful.
5,African American Lives 2,"Wow! It's kind of creepy, but it will make you want to follow your roots.Honestly, I'm not sure that I would want to know!!!"
5,Great Album,"I recently bought this CD, without high expectations. There were no reviews so I decided to take a chance because I am I big fan of Snoop Dogg (or Snoop Lion now haha) and have many of his albums. This was a great CD from start to finish. The sound is in good quality and it is the full show. The vibe from playing at this concert venue really shows in the recording. It is Snoop Dogg recording on a very good night.If you are a fan of Snoop Dogg get this album, you will not be disappointed."
2,Better name it The Python Bible,"Bibles, in the profane sense of the word, are huge books filled with clutter and not meaningful structure, which attempt to cover way more than they should. This is a clear example. It might be worth a quick look to a particular chapter, just to get a quick grasp of a particular area like XML, pygame, tkinter, etc. But definitely, this is not the book a beginner should use to learn the language, because as many said before, it seems to be a blind translation from their also crippled Java book. This reader, who cherished their C/C++ book couldn't be more dissappointed."
4,Not as impressive as it could be...,"I provided technical review (I was one of many) for this book, but frankly I didn't enjoy it all that much. It does cover the material well, but the presentation is dry and the print (typeface) is unpleasant in my opinion.As a textbook it would be quite effective; if they would reissue it in a clean, easy-to-read format (like an O'Reilly or New Riders book for instance) I'd rate it higher."
5,Very Deep - Excellent intro to OOP and Python,An excellent intro to Object oriented programming in general and Python in particular. A real hefty volume. Wish I could afford it.
1,Does not have any Perl information,"The book has a lot of hand waving but no concrete information on Python where it matters. For example there is no comparison of it with Perl. In fact they never say how the two can work.Also the authors do not cover at all the Meta Object Protocol of Python or for example how it does virtual pointer-based interface inheritance. These are important concepts that a student of Python must know. Also missing is any information on the transmutation of objects under constraints.All in all, way too elementary."
5,I can't stop reading this book!,"I'm only half way through this book and I can't put it down. It's the first Forgotten Realms book I've ever read, although I know a lot about the world from AD&D, and I love it! The Bedine are a wonderfull race dealing with honor and vengeance although they remind me of the Aiel, other desert dwellers from the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. Another highly recommended book. But, back to the matter at hand. Ruha is an intriguing character, I haven't quite figured her out yet. I can't wait to finish this book and continue to read further in the Harper Series."
3,There was just something missing in this one,"While this book was enjoyable for the most part, I really felt as if it was missing something throughout the story.. Its hard to say exactly what that something is, but I just wasn't fulfilled after this Harpers novel. More detail should have been provided in some instances and the background characters were too predictable (the sheiks and the Zhents). There's something else though that left me with a bored feeling throughout much of the novel. Maybe it was just a little too predictable or maybe I was just looking for something with a little more serious/mature feeling, but I just couldn't ever really get into Ruha and Lander's plight.I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I was surprised to see this novel getting an overall 4.5 star rating on Amazon."
4,Sunpak 777B Ultra Pro Tripod,"I have had the tripod for a few weeks. I selected it because it had a decent capacity (11 pounds) and was quite sturdy. It arrived quickly, the product is as advertised. It is a bit heavy, not something you would go backpacking with, but I did not buy it for that purpose. I wanted something that I would put the Nikon digital SLR on and not have to worry that a gust of wind would tip it over. The legs are a little stiff when you go to setup or take down. That might change as I use it, not a huge issue. The knobs and crank seem to be well made, the head operates smoothly. I have been very satisified with the purchase."
2,Not a very good tripod.,"I purchased this tripod to carry in the car, but it's not very good. The head does not move smoothly, it's hard if not impossible to get it leveled, once it's leveled all you gotta do is move the head and your leveling goes away.Tripod sits in the back of my closet, never use it."
2,A Fatal Flaw,"Sadly, I returned this tripod and ordered a replacement. Sader yet is that I am now returning the replacement tripod also. Why? Because of a fatal flaw in the design. The tripod as a whole is quite nice--if just a tad heavy. However I need this tripod for panoramic shots using a panoramic head attached to the removable plate. The fatal flaw is that the head does not fully lock, so that when the camera is attached to the pano head the vertical tilt does not stay locked, and can topple the entire head. My much less expensive and ""fancy"" old tripod has a ratcheded vertical tilt so that when it is fully locked down it can not move even if forced. I actually called the company to see if this is a design flaw and they assured me that the replacement would fully lock. Alas, it doesn't. I would not recommend this for anyone using a pano head...as it will tip over.DL in PS, CA"
1,CHEAP!!,"Amazon sent me a used tripod. How do i know? The original box was crushed, the pivot arm was bent. So i refunded it"
1,Terribly disappointing,"I admire John O'Hara's work enormously. For a very long time, From the Terrace was my favorite novel. But don't read this one -this last novel by O'Hara is just awful. Don't let it mar the appreciation of O'Hara's genius. One can only speculate that he had some sense of his approaching death (two months later) and felt he had to get it out the door. It's very bad and completely unworthy of him - or of your time."
3,Looks may be deceiving,"After reading through the entire book and trying out several recipes I have to say I am a bit disappointed. The photos of the desserts do not necessarily match the recipe instructions. For example, the Chocolate Coconut Cake instructs one to sprinkle toasted coconut over the top and sides of the cake but the photograph shows a cake with a sleek coating of ganache on top. This may seem like a picky complaint, but why photograph a dessert that looks different than the recipe outcome? Afterall, this is a book for home cooks not professional pastry chefs. In fairness to Mr. Payard, the book does explain techniques well and is very user friendly."
4,Crying baby in part I,"It never amazes me how incredibly oblivious and rude people are. There is a woman in the audience with what looks like a 6 month of baby that squeels and crys in the beginning. Wow, bring a baby to a lecture. What could possibly go wrong. I don't know if she eventually has enough sense to leave or someone like myself asked her to get a clue. Other than that, it looks good especially for kids. NOT BABIES.Update- apparently the baby is a prop to make a point. I have a point of my own to make. It adds NOTHING significant to the lecture and is EXTREMELY distracting for a listener. Bad decision."
4,sunglasses,the sunglasses came quick and in good condition. they do not fit over my prescription glasses as asvertised.
5,Slang -- truly a great and underrated album,"I agree with the review 'Let Them Change' - most bands do it at one time or another. Def Leppard did in 1996 with 'Slang' and it's I think one of their best albums. There's not one bad song on the entire album and I prefer this album to all other DL albums with the exception of 'Yeah'. If you haven't given this album or the snippets here a listen, you're really missing out on a great album."
5,we want another slang,slang is the third best def leppard cd. pyromania is their best cd. hysteria is their second best cd.
5,An underrated classic by the Lepps,"I am sick about the ""classic"" lepp sound talk. They are a music band and one expects them to progress and not play the same s@#t year after year. The best bands grow and evolve into better acts. This does not detract from their previous work - It showcases the growth og the band musically.Slang is a great record for a band which was at the crossroads. An album of great variety and depth. Most experiments here work and sound wonderful. For the average fan who expect a wall of hooks and riffarama... grow up guys!Along with Retroactive this record showcases the true depth of the Lepps and is a pointer to how raw and rocking their music can get. Yes they sound as good without a zillion guitar overlays and teenybop lyrics that Mutt Lange brings in.Sure Hysteria and Pyromania are still my favorite Lepp Records, but I have grown and feel the Lepps did too with this album.Hooray for Slang!!!"
3,Don't wanna get my hands dirty...,"I am most likely in the minority here but I think quite frankly that `Slang' is boring! The quality may be there, the musicianship and what many might consider good songs but jeez Louise; no less than four ballads on this record? Were they really changing their direction that much? Although I do appreciate the band trying to maintain their relevancy in the mid nineties but I can honest say that I probably would listen to `On Through the Night"", ""High and Dry"" or ""Pyromania"" a hundred times before I would play `Slang' once. The title track, ""Work It Out"" and ""Truth?"" are decent if not memorable songs and I think ""Gift of Flesh"" is probably the most Def Leppard cut on this LP but otherwise not much more on here I would recommend. But hey don't take my word for it because I'm just a jaded 80's metal fan and that's what I want to remember Def Leppard as they once were - one of the driving forces of the NWOBHM - not as `Slang' would present them as - a grunge derivative."
5,Slang,I think the best album... a little dark and moody. The song slang is definitely not a favorite of mine... I love the song work it out. I put this album on top of all the Lep albums. Joe sounds great and Phil's backing vocals on Blood Runs Cold are great!
2,"Buy this one last, if at all","It is hard to handle when a hair metal band decides to grow up. If I wanted to listen to more mature artists I wouldn't buy a Def Leppard album in the first place. In saying this though Hysteria, Pyromania, Vault, Adrenalize and even Retroactive are a lot of fun and classic pop/metal albms, especially the first two mentioned. Give this one a miss, you won't regret it. Work It Out is the only half decent track."
2,Def Leppard go alternative,This is is an album I've yet to buy I heard the songs through samples. The 11 tunes are all very well done Joe's voice is top notch but the playing is below par for them. The stand out tracks are Truth? Turn to dust and gift of flesh. This is a better release than the new one X. 2 and half stars
2,Only three songs worth a listen..............,"In my never so humble opinion, ""Turn To Dust"", ""All I Want Is Everything"" and ""Deliver Me"" are the only tunes on Slang worth having. This is from a guy who likes their early work and doesn't like their change to grunge."
1,It's called 'Slang' cuz it's not the real Def Leppard,"Even the one redeeming track on this CD (Where Does Love Go When It Dies)isn't that good and hardly worth the effort of actually putting the CD in the player. If I want to listen to the crappy, Seattle grunge sound, then I'll buy a Pearl Jam CD. This is one of those CD's that was meant to be hung from someone's rear view mirror and never played. I'd use it for skeet shooting, but the reflection might blind me. The kind of album that makes you wish you were deaf. Wish I could give it a zero; a one is to generous."
2,eh i guess,"I got these cd's in the mail before the expected delivery date, which was a plus. I only paid $0.99 a piece for two of them .The only disappointment I had was the cd cases were shattered. I can't expect much for a dollar, but one cd was loose in the case."
2,This is the same band who put out Hysteria? Pitiful!!,"It's okay, just not def leppard!!! I wonder, since this is the first album without ""mutt"" lange, and STeve Clark, if the once talented band lost something very important!?"
4,Def Leppard gets Dark,"This album was something of a surprise after buying Hysteria and Vault. Tracks such as ""Truth?"" and ""Gift of Flesh"" feel angry and cynical, and ""Deliver Me"" and ""Pearl of Euphoria"" shed light on a darker, more sinister side to the band. Even their slower ballads, such as ""All I Want Is Everything"" and ""Where Does Love Go When It Dies"" seem anguished and sad. I found the electronic beats and the lyrics of the pop-ish single track, ""Work It Out"", very annoying; it's the track I almost always skip. I find myself coming back to the darker strains of ""Truth?"", ""Blood Runs Cold"" and ""Pearl of Euphoria"" again and again.I keep wondering whether many of the tracks, especially ""Blood Runs Cold"", were born of the death of lead guitarist Steve Clark..."
4,"It's Good, But Not Def Leppard As We Love 'Em","Ok, first off, Slang is alot better than most albums that have appeared on the scene of late...with that said, it pales in comparison to the masterpiece of Hysteria. To top that album would be too great of an expectation though. The Leps experimented on this album and got decent reviews from everyone BUT their fans. Critics, for some reason, despise that great, bombastic, catchy sound the Leps are known for. Could be because they were probably sitting at home wishing they could get a date during the late 80s and have come to despise that time period in their lives. GOOD NEWS: The Leps are working on a new album that is said to be a cross between Pyromania and Hysteria! Glad to see their moving forward with what they do best! Look for the album and a summer tour!"
4,not enough credit for expanding sound,"it's really too bad that people haven't taken to this album especially since it is probably their 2nd best album behind hysteria. too much criticism seems to be heaped toward mutt lange when all the guy does is produce winners (foreigner, ac/dc, the leps, shania twain!) the thing i like about def leppard is that they don't fill their albums with 16 songs just to fill a disk...they have 10 to 12 top quality songs on every album (except maybe adrenalize.) and on slang they have 11 songs that, when listened to over time, will have you humming a different track every day."
2,Slang: A Sell-Out Album (Metallica Fans Take Note),"Def Leppard created a style all their own in the '80s -- a style copied by many bands but Def Leppard did it best. They combined the heavy distorted guitar sound of '70s glam rock bands such as Mott the Hoople and T.Rex and fused that sound with elements of Led Zeppelin (pounding drums and bass) and Queen (catchy vocal melodies).But in 1996, after pop metal had fallen out of popularity, Def Leppard made Slang.Slang copies every succesful grunge and alternative band of the '90s. Slang does succeed here and there but it ain't Def Leppard at their best. People accuse Metallica of selling-out (a term that is over-used) but if Metallica had really sold-out, wouldn't they have gone grunge or alternative? Metallica did not sell-out. Def Leppard attempted to sell-out on Slang. Slang is a true sell-out album, not Metallica's recent stuff.But it ain't all bad -- there is a good song or two to be found on Slang. It just isn't Def Leppard at their best."
3,A change for the Leps.,"Not one of my favorites but still listenable. Favs consists of Work It Out,Pearl of Euphoria,and others. People might think the band made a change for alternative music. I would disagree. Don't really expect 80's Leppard more of a serious album."
4,A fine piece of work!,"At the time of its release'Slang'was a bold move on the part of a band considered a relic of the overproduced eighties;whithout their long-time producer and collaborator 'Mutt'Lange,Def Leppard went to Spain and created a surprisingly strong and original album,showing that they have enough versatility left to see them through the millenium."
4,learner guitar,Great learner package.handles very well and sounds great.I purchased a red and a blue combo at a very good deal for the quality.My 13 and 11 year old daughters fit the style n shape of both guitars very well.JB
3,true balance shows some simple ways to balance yourself,true balance shows some simple ways to balance yourself. it seems like a good introduction to the topic of energy balance. I was looking for more advanced techniques.
2,Sorely disappointed,"I had high expectations from the glowing reviews, but found this book a complete disappointment. There was absolutely nothing here that can't be located online or discovered in hundreds of other books on balance. By halfway through I knew it was a waste of time and didn't finish it. I learned nothing new."
1,Very bad...!!,It makes your skin really dry and the moisturizer feels oliy to meIt worsened my acne overall.Please consider carefully before you buy this!
4,Tasty Chew,"And I mean both of those too the utmost. These things are awesome flavor wise, but your jaw will ache if you eat too many. Think about chewing a rubber band that had a burst of licorice and molasses flavor with every chomp and you'll get the idea. I guess it makes the flavor last longer if you actually have to work at chewing the product up. Definite worth it though."
4,"Tonight: Metallica, with special guest Yo Yo Ma!","I had no idea what to expect when I bought this, but being a die-hard Metallifuk I had to see what it had to offer. Man was I surprised! The arrangements of the songs on this album really hightlight the incredible song writing tallents that METALLICA posseses. Some of the songs actually sound like they were written for the cello, and most of the others are well adapted to this instrument. If you want to hear the music behind METALLICA then this is the album for you; no lyrics to interfere (although one of the cellos does follow the vocal line in each song), no drums, nothing but the music. I applaud APOCALYPTICA's work."
2,Cellos played like electric guitars!,This cd is dissapointing. Why? because it's not a real mix of classical and metal music. The guys just played his cellos like playing electric guitars. Nothing else. It sounds cleanless and noisy. A mix of styles is not only to change the instruments.If you want to listen a real mix of metal and classic music with real good arranges and high musicality buy the S & M (Metallica and Orchestra)
3,"Technically proficient, but...","OK, so I like all kinds of music, from classic rock to classical, Celtic to Heavy Metal, emphasis on the metal. I'm a big fan of Metallica, so I thought I'd give this a try. While it is OK, it's not great. Yes, the bass parts are reproduced well, and a fair job was done on the high end, but overall the music wasn't what I would call cohesive. Looking at Metallica's music, most of their work just gels: The rhythm section is tight, the lead and vocals play off each other and the rhythm, and the music flows well overall, even on their debut album. Not like Apocalyptica's renditions (or, for that matter St. Anger, but that's another review): While the playing is technically great, it just sounds, in many cases, like four guys playing four pieces. What results is a cacophony of sounds which occasionally sync up and sound good."
4,Raw Art,"Being their first real album, and covering Metallica, the sound is a bit raw at times, but still beautifully done. It's art that became polished by the time they did the cover of Fade to Black. Just put it on, kick back, and enjoy."
4,Metal to Classical,"I truly enjoy this cd,It exposes the ""link"" between qaulity metal and classical music,AMAZEING"
3,"IT'S OK, BUT WILL ONLY LAST A LITTLE WHILE...","so, this is a good cd and all, possibly something interesting to put on at a party to impress your friends or something, but after listening to it more than maybe once or twice, it's nothing more than mere novelty. definitely buy it used, and don't say i didn't warn you about the novelty part.-chris-"
2,Nice gimmick but...,"So these guys have a gimmick; they play arrangement of Metallica songs for four cellos, as the title of the album makes clear. Well, that sounds like an interesting idea, and it is somewhat, but unfortunately the execution here is lacking. When you get past the novelty of hearing these songs like this, it's the little details that determine whether the recording will have any lasting value to make you want to listen again and again. Unfortunately in this case we have sloppy playing, including bad intonation (out of tune notes) in many places, and in a lot of places the transcriptions are just plain wrong. They also aren't particularly interesting arrrangements, really. Once you've heard one track you've pretty much heard the approach they take on every piece.Overall, an interesting gimmick but doesn't hold up to repeated listenings."
2,Not so hot,"The only good thing I can say about this CD is that it is certainly an interesting twist on Metallica, but why buy it when the real original songs are so much better. If you are going to buy anything like this, buy the S&M DVD and use the special symphony only feature. That way you can hear Metallica with a full symphony. Either way, this CD is not worth the money. Being a hardcore fan with every album, I do not recommend getting this album."
2,Squeaky cellos cant hack Metallica,"Well, considering the reviews were so good, I thought I'd get it. That was a big mistake. 4 cellos just dont do it for me. Most of the time they sound like fingernails on a chalkboard. I love Metallica, and own all their CD's, but this CD is terrible. Although I am looking forward to S&M........"
1,Metallica deflated,"The power of Metallica's music cannot possibly be reproduced by four mild-mannered cellos. Their music was never meant to be so quiet, it loses all meaning."
1,A big disappointment,"I am a huge Metallica fan, but this CD is terrible. Simply put, Metallica is not to be played on classical instruments. I am now beginning to think that the Metallica crew are simply looking for more ways to fatten their wallets (which, of course, they could do by producing good, NEW music, instead of recycling old stuff... But alas, that would require work!)"
4,Different,"Apocalyptica are a different sort of heavy metal band. Imagine ""One"" being played on cellos and you have this album. Although at frst I thought that it would be corny, I came to realise that this album really rocked. When my wife and I have company over, I can put in this CD (or ""Inquisition Symphony"". their other CD) and no one knows that it's metal music. It's great, people who listen to country music tell me how good it is. How cultured I seem. Then I drop the bomb. Their looks are worth the money spent when they find out they've been listening to Metallica."
4,Cool !,"This CD certainly shows what can be done with the Raw hard edged sound of Metallica ! Thumbs up guys, now I can have a romantic dinner with my girl AND play Metallica at the same time......."
3,Metallica played by Cellos!,"Apocalyptica is an interesting ablum in that Metallica fans will enjoy the songs, while on the other hand may not agree with the way that they are played. Athough sometimes it seems as though the artists are straining and attempting to sound too ""hard"", they pull off the album very cleanly,and I believe that their devotion and musical talent deserves credit. You should buy this album if you enjoy classical music, but also enjoy Metallica."
3,Not what I expected,"Although a pretty good CD, I expected a more complete sound, more depth. The 4 cellos don't have the power to get a good feeling of the music. The recording also needs to much clearer. Buy it if you like classical, but don't buy it if you think it will be just like Metallica."
5,what a discovery,"I can't believe what I have discovered here. Im so blown away. I don't even like Metallica that much. Yes there is something special about Metallica though. They have this dark, almost medival sound that you must listen carefuly for. Nobody else has that. This band Apocalyptica captures it completely!!! Better than even Metallica can!! Its like a band has taken another bands music, and perfectly, beautifuly spelled out for you what you love about it!!! I was skeptical at first. Sounds so corny. 4 Cellos play white trashy metal. But.....its amazing. Keep an open mind. It is note for note. Listen to it for the darkness. Very ancient sounding, almost religious. Once in a while you discover something really special. It doesnt happen often because there are no resources like Mtv for great music. Only crap. This is special."
2,nostalgic,"Apocalyptica makes me want to listen to Metallica. These guys would do better to compose their own original heavy-metal influenced peices. Great idea, just not fully realized."
3,"Not great condition, but it worked for my purposes","The leather on this was wrinkled and marked, so if I had wanted to use this as shipped I probably wouldn't have been thrilled with the product. But I was using it as a base for a DIY clutch project and it was the perfect size and I wanted a product that was real leather, so I was overall happy with what I got."
1,Horrible Quality Don't BUY IT - WASTE Of MONEY,This is the worst pouch for the $$$. Don't even dare buying it. It's all scuffed up and the zippers are horrible quality.
2,A victim of its own devices,"Plot-wise This movie was somewhat interesting at first, but ultimately very predictable and unsatisfying.The movie was presented as a single take - so the camera follows the protagonist from the beginning until the end. This device was probably interesting on paper but ended up limiting the film. In fact,it becomes the gimmicky identity of the movie itself.I will say the film makers did TRY. This isn't a total zero of a movie, it's more like a failed experiment."
2,Predictable.,"Five minutes into the movie, I knew the ending. Was supposed to have a surprise twist but failed miserably. Overacted."
1,Awful,"I hated it from the very beginning with the ever so trying to be hip Dad & the creepy touchy feely type uncle (""My have you Grown Sarah""). It was the worst movie ever! All she (Olson) did was run around & cry the whole damn time & I had no idea what was happening and when because of the way it was filmed. The film gave no real background of her character like where was her Mom and other family? why after all this years did they come back to sell the house? Hated it!"
1,Still waiting,"Still waiting for the scary as hell part according to information on the cover of the dvd case. Even skipping sections of the movie did not make it go by any faster. Countless parts were so predictable, especially if you are a fan of suspense thrillers or horror movies. There was no plot, no storyline, no build up to anything.It is a waste of money and sadly enough you cannot return movies for a refund just because they suck."
1,Waste of my time,"I thought the movie was very slow moving and was getting quite bored through out. The end was good, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time watching it."
1,AWFUL,"this was one of the slowest, worst movies I have not been able to sit through since blair witch. UGH"
2,It's a remake.,"Before this movie even came out, I saw the original here at Amazon.com. It was filmed in Europe, I believe. The original has a bit more of suspense and bite to it. I think the original maybe cheaper to rent at Amazon.com also."
1,terd of a movie,"terd of a movie allot of the camera shot are blury and in the dark this movie is a brair witch affect do not waste your money cheezy, builds suspence on dark and sounds very bad script a five year old would not bew scared of this movie"
3,Silent House,"Well ,I love scary movies since I was a kid. My two favorite are the original House of Wax with Vincent Price and John Carpenter's Halloween. No blood,no torture and no dismemberment, those I could do without.Now we come to Silent House.Much of the movie was great. There were some bumps ,jumps and creeps. The created atmosphere was just what the doctor ordered and Elizabeth Olsen did a fine acting job. My only disappointment was that, after enjoying this well executed story, I felt the ending was weak and made no sense to me.Would I recommend it, maybe to rent ,not to own. What I think is a shame is that the last I remember is the weakest part."
4,Silent House Intriguing,Very dark. Has a a nice level of suspense. Creepy. :)Elizabeth Olsen is definitely an entertaining actor. She has a quality I can not describe but even when I feel I don't like her she does something interesting. Good film overal and great performances from cast.
4,Edge of the seat action......,"Twists and turns every moment, with an ending I never expected! The whole time I thought it was something totally different!!!! Must see!"
5,"Original storyline, outstanding performance","Elizabeth Olsen is a true talent and gives a riveting performance in Silent House. The film itself is extremely unsettling and FAR from boring. If it didnt have the added gimmick of being filmed in one shot, it wouldnt change my opinion at all- in fact I forgot about it after. Its a must see if you like twisted endings and non-gory horror."
1,I Couldn't Get Into This Movie,"This movie starts out so slow, with such cheesy acting, I did not even finish the entire movie, although I had already paid for it. It was a waste of my time."
1,Slow and boring,This is sort of a cross between Blair witch project and Paranormal event. The main character appears to be aimlessly roaming around and jumping at shadows and at the slightest noise. Save your money and skip this one.
1,Don't Do it,Just not a good movie. It was the same old story with an ending that is sure to upset you.
1,"Really, really bad.","Silent house, silent and empty movie theater and really, really bad. Stupid dialogue and one continuous shot that drives you crazy. it's like watching a movie without blinking. Poor lighting, poor acting and an ending that is supposed to make the entire 90 boring minutes worth it. Don't bother. You will want to turn it off after just 15 minutes."
1,silent house,"This was a horrible movie. Wished I wouldn't have wasted my time and money on it. I love scary movies, not this one. I have to beg my husband to watch them with me. I talked him into watching this one and now he probably wont ever watch one with me again. He thinks they're stupid. He was right about this one."
2,I wanted to turn it off!,"Not because it was so scary, but because there was no point. The bouncing camera, poor setup of the storyline. Super cliche' no cell reception, no light, strange sounds. And it's short - 1.5hrs if that. Don't spend your money on this folks!!"
2,terrible,"On paper, the plot is interesting but the filming is terrible. If you like the Blair Witch style, maybe this movie is for you. The camera is shaky half the time and the set is too dark. They also spend way too much time exploring the house with no action. In summary, it's a good idea for a movie but the execution is terrible."
4,Good psychological thriller,Good film making tricks and good acting from the main character make this good psychological thriller/horror worth watching. Your eyes will have a hard time leaving the screen.
2,Another Psycho Flick,"I have long been a fan of horror movies, but my preferences have changed with the passage of time. To state my biases clearly, I enjoy a good ghost story or a ""creature feature"", but I dislike horror movies about psychotic maniacs: you don't need any movies to experience these, just tune into the news. It is, of course, a personal preference but I particularly dislike movies that play games with what is reality in the context of the story. I always feel as if I've been tricked. I have no complaints about the acting or cinematography in ""Silent House"" , and the actors and staff deserve credit for a performance well done. I just wanted to see a good ghost story not movie about a mentally ill person. Obviously, many people have different preferences and tastes, which I certainly respect, and really enjoy this subtype. I intend no insults, but I do think potential viewers should understand precisely what the movie is."
1,Sucked,I'm sorry but personally this movie sucked so bad and it was so drawn out and it wasn't at all worth watching. I watched it in theaters and i definetly will not buy it when it comes out... This movie was so stupid it was unreal.. I rate it a 1 out of 5 for at least trying to direct it...
2,Disappointing,"I felt this movie was terribly disappointing. My issues are:1. She seemed to get freaked out/scared WAY to easily. I was wondering why she would react so terrified to such simple stuff. She knew her dad and uncle were there, so hearing sounds isn't really abnormal.2. They advertised this as in real-time style, but by the end of the movie, you realize that was entirely pointless (SPOILER: there is a twist that makes the real-time aspect completely bogus since what we've been watching isn't what was going on. So what we saw wasn't even the correct unfolding of events).I feel the movie was very cliche with an ending that's been beaten to death. Some may find this scary, but I was just scratching my head wondering why she was so freaked out so quickly. And wondering when I would finally get a good scare. Never happened."
1,silent house 2012,"5 words can describe this movieBORING, INSULTED INTELLIGENCE, CHEAP, BORINGreal yawner, plus the fact is was so cheaply made. most of the picture was out of focus, photographer-director-writer should watch some old speghetti westerns and take notes.the best part of the move was""the end""Silent House"
2,Nothing New,"This movie was nothing that we haven't already seen with Hide and Seek or Secret Window. This was an unoriginal, predictable, below average film."
3,"Ok, i guess.","The movie has a lot of good suspense, but towards the middle you kind of get whats going on. The plot was awful but the suspense was good. I would rent it but i wouldn't buy it."
5,Dont let the cover direct you away from this film!,I watched this movie with my boyfriend and we were left unsure and guessing until the end when everything is revealed. Great thriller that made me feel uneasy. Definitely thought the uninterrupted shot was a really cool detail to this film. I would definitely recommend my friends to watch this. Great film. We were very surprised that there were 18 views and 2.5 stars. We had to have passed this movie a million times on instant and never watched the trailer. I dont regret coming across this movie at all. Hope you enjoy this film as much as we did.
3,Good scare tactics...until the end,A creepy remake with ingenious scare tactics but...like the original does not have a cohesive plot to make us believe any of the rubbish ending.
2,Predictable,It wasn't a bad idea...just too predictable for me. I thought it was a ghost story but wasn't and didn't scare me at all.
3,great plot twist,This movie was pretty good. It has a great plot twist. Some periods were boring. But if you turn down the lights and grab some popcorn you can enjoy this movie.
3,Good buildup to an ultimate letdown.,"I have to say that I wasn't expecting much after reading reviews..I guess that's why I wasn't as disappointed as most. The movie itself was pretty enjoyable for me up until the final act. It just completely threw me for a loop, and not in a good way. It made the rest of the movie make nearly no sense to me. It's a shame really because I truly was enjoying the movie up to that point. I'm still giving the movie 3 stars because I thought Elizabeth Olsen did a great job, and the rest of the performances weren't anything terrible either. A friend of mine came up with a great way to describe this movie...It was like watching Ghostbusters (no real resemblance..just using it as in reference to a good movie that I enjoyed) and then at the end finding out it was all just an amusement park ride. Overall, a great movie experience for myself that ultimately ended up falling short. I'm not upset I watched it, but it could've been a pass."
2,Terribly predictable,"Nothing new or unique. This movie was perfectly predictable. It was very easy early on to figure out what exactly was happening and where we were heading.If you are looking for scary or thrilling, look elsewhere."
2,Predictable...been done a few times,"This movie has been done before several times. Maybe I have seen to many of them but for me there was no twist.I figured it out pretty quickly. It's a combo of a Deniro flick( which I won't say) & quarantine. I thought quarantine was a much better movie.I really like Elizabeth Olson & she is an up & comer ,but this was not her best work.Basically I wasn't afraid & was pretty bored until the last 20 minutes."
2,It dragged on until the very end.,This movie dragged on until the very end. It really could have been a 10 minute movie. The remaining part was just her running away from this mistery figure.
2,not for me,"not my type of movie , this movie was my wifes pick and she didn't like it . i did get caught up on some reports."
2,Silent House,This movie was okay i was just totally confused by the ending i'm not sure if it was a ghost story or something else. it was not what i expected it to be. i did though liked elizabeth olsen's acting she was the only promising actor in that movie. all in all it was okay. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't. it was a little creepy but not scary
2,Let down!,"Okay. I was so excited about this movie when I saw the trailers. The idea that the piece was going to be happening ""in real time"" seemed like a really cool and unique way to shoot a horror film. And....for about the first 2/3 of the film it was. But that is where it all fell apart. The ending of the movie was so out of left field and so incongruent to the rest of the film I literally had to rewind it to make sure I didn't miss something. Sadly, I didn't.It's too bad because the acting and premise were very good. The ending was just a sad letdown."
2,Disappointing,"Thought the movie would be suspenseful and interesting, instead it turned out to be one of those cliche' psycho films. Halfway through you basically figured the whole thing out and just wanted it to end so you could rent and watch something else."
2,waste of time,"This movie was great if you like bad acting, predictable plots and teasing girls in revealing shirts. It reminded me of a trip I took to a strip club back in the early 90's. The girl worked me up and then left me hanging at the end. No resolution. Thank goodness I borrowed this from the library. But I will never again get those minutes back that I sat through watching this. If you like Ms. Olsen, check it out, she's kinda cute and built, otherwise, go with a better movie."
2,The lamest fright flick I have ever seen,"I was expecting much more out of this movie. I had even read a bunch of reviews that made it sound ""promising"". I was wrong and so were the good reviews. This movie had very little going for it. The story line was weak, the characters were mediocre at best and the so-called ""twist"" ending was a complete letdown. I won't ruin the ending for those who choose to suffer through this lame adventure in a dark house, however, I will advise you to save your money. This one was so much of a sleeper, that it made me doze.If you want a good flick with one of the best twist endings ever, buy or rent ""Fallen"" (with Denzel Washington and John Goodman). Now that was a worthwhile movie."
3,It's a pretty decent flick...,"I watched this movie in a dark dark room. The setting was great, had a few suspenseful parts that did make me jump a bit, but overall not my cup of tea. Without giving away the ending let's just say its the type of movie that as a mother the theme was a bit disturbing. I think Elizabeth Olsen was good, and she was definitely believable in her role. A good movie to pass the time for fans of suspense."
2,Be forewarned...,"This movie is clunky and the supporting cast is terrible, BUT watching Elizabeth Olsen in a single take for an hour and a half might still be worth your money. Go, Elizabeth! Rent, don't buy."
1,"weak movie ,","Lots of screaming and BS , very weak movie . wasted money . Do not even consider to rent this crappy one . Just one star ."

1,"Tiffany, really?",Come on. Really? Tiffany? Really? On anything connected to the Smiths? I don't think so. That's just absurd.The legend is aghast.
3,Cool concept,"I dig the smiths, so I dig the concept of a covers album. As you would expect, some songs are great. Most songs are horrible. The Smiths do them all better than these covers. It's a quirky thing you might listen to once or twice, but I can't imagine listening to this more than that."
2,"An ""off day"" for a literary genius.","I'm gonna make this review short. If you've read ""Sanctuary"", then this book might be worth reading....once. Don't expect the usual Faulkner greatness, however - it's readable and that's all. There are about, oh, say, 20 or so Faulkner works I would recommend before this one. ""Sanctuary"" really didn't need a sequel, IMHO.If you haven't read ""Sanctuary"", don't even bother. I can almost guarantee you'll dislike it and/or be confused by it. Not highly recommended."
5,This is the only thing we listen to!,"I bought this CD based on a recommendation from a friend and it has been the one and only ""night night"" CD we have used. Sometimes we have to play it twice before we fall asleep but I have it on the iPod and keep the CD in our travel bag so that we always have it with us :)"
3,yuck,I was hoping that at least some of the songs on this cd would have lyrics to them. I was disappointed.
4,Absolute Sleep guarantee,"My son who is 5 months old takes only 2-3 songs before he is out - this is an absolute fail safe gurantee for sleep and also is supposed to develop his mind while listening. Great buy, no regrets."
2,Rythyms are too fast to be lullabies,"Just because classical music doesn't have words, that doesn't classify it as 'lullaby' material. Call me crazy, but lullabies are supposed to be soft, mellow, slow songs that sooth your child and lull them to sleep. Many of the songs on this CD have quick rythyms and a 'tinny' sound that I hardly find soothing. A MUCH better choice is the Fisher Price Lullaby CD."
4,Great combination of pieces,"This is a great compilation. Of course what is great about it is the composers of the music that have nothing to do with Baby Einstein. But all the power to them for taking another simple idea and bringing it forth to our babies. This music is relaxing and educational. Remember (being a music teacher and performer myself,) This should only be the beginning to your childs classical music intoduction."
4,ImThankful.com,My three girls grew up watching the video's it is great to see the legacy live on! You are making a difference. Thank you and keep it up! [...]
3,Fine for any time of day,"Some tracks are a little uptempo, yes, but turning the volume down should help.I don't use CDs to put my son to sleep except as a last resort--IMO there's no substitute for a soothing song actually *sung* by dad/mom/grandma/etc. while baby (who doesn't care about your singing ability!) drifts off on your shoulder... That said, it's a fun CD for any time of day.Regarding the synth instrumentation: since I was raised listening to ""real"" classical arrangements, I initially felt ""why dumb down the arrangement for kids?"" that others have expressed. But I'm mostly over it... it's fine on some tracks, if a little grating on others. Any classical music will be better for baby than staring at TV."
1,Pulp classics,"If you want your child to grow up thinking that classical music, or any music, is made by perfectly symmetrical beats with almost no change in volume or human expression, then this CD is for you.If you want your child to think that musical instruments sound like your PC starting up, then this CD is for you.Lazy music made in a studio. Apparently there's a flute, piano, cello, horn, and oboe in there somewhere but all I hear is cheap midi noises.If my children can sleep to the sound of their Dad's grinding teeth then this CD might work.Save your money and stick on classical radio or simple real music like piano sonatas, string quartets etc... !"
2,Not real music!,"I bought this for our baby and like many of the reviewers, I was disappointed in the synthesized music. I have played some of the pieces, and although the concept is good, I want my child to hear music as it was on intended on the real instruments."
5,been soothing my son to sleep for 3.5 YEARS,We've been playing this CD at bedtime for our son since he was born. He's now over 3 and half!! He sometimes now even plays it again for himself in his room if he hasn't fallen asleep by the time it ends playing! He absolutely loves it and we do too. They even play this CD at his pre-school at nap time. I get it for all my friends that are expecting!
2,Synthesizer,"I love the music on this CD, but the synthesizer arrangements are mechanical. It's soo close to being a wonderful CD."
2,stinky for Einstein,Generally Einstein is always a winner but this was not in our book (Baby and Me) Try someone else before buying . The libary is a great resource to check it out ahead.
2,Lame,"I was really disappointed in this CD. I was expecting a toned-down version of real classical music, but it sounds really fake and tinkley and weird. Not soothing at all."
1,Doesn't do justice to the music or the child,"Like other posters, I was very disappointed to hear that this was not real orchestral music. You would never know this from the packaging! My baby loves classical music but was indifferent to this album, and I can understand why, it's not nearly as dynamic as the real music -- all at the same volume, no emotion -- and it's just not very good. We have other synthesizer lullabies we love (I highly recommend Bedtime with the Beatles), but this sounds like a toy."
3,"Nice......not for bedtime, though","Nice CD but many of the classic songs featured are played at a much faster tempo than the original version. Its not something I play at bedtime for that reason. It does nothing to help my baby wind down...for that we play the Parents lullaby cd...very soft, soothing"
5,perfect bedtime music for baby,"We always play this cd during the evening routine, just right before the baby's falling asleep and he really likes it. The light tunes are really efficient for this purpose. It is a mixture of songs from the big classics like Mozart, Vivaldi, Bach, Debussy. Worth the money!"
5,Delightful,"I bought my first copy for an infant born to an acquaintance. The music was so delightful, that I bought another copy for myself, and listen to it on my iPod when I'm on the train going to work. It has such an innocent sound to it that it's a real treat to listen to."
5,Einstein,Anything that has an Einstein in the title my twins love. I used to play this for them at night while they slept.
5,Great bedtime CD!!,My son loves this cd at bedtime! The music is great and very relaxing! I recommend it to all new moms!
3,Not bad,"This CD is okay, but then again I am not a big fan of classical music. I prefer to have words. My daughter likes the CD though. I play it in her room before bed. I think it makes a good gift.Just don't play it the car or you will get very sleepy."
4,Great and relaxing,I am very satisfied with the song compilation on this CD. Seems good and relaxing but the final test will be what the baby thinks! Still waiting for that!
2,not my cup of tea,I felt that the vocals were weak in this CD. The whole tone of CD was that everyone needed a big cup of strong coffee or something. There was no pep. Everything just dragged on.
4,Highly Recommended,"I have been frequent to Philip's web site and I have seen much of the material that he was going to publich in this book, including, photos, since the contents are available on the web. Still, it's nice to have the printed version. It's loaded with a full variety of thought-provoking, inspiring comments, suggestions, aha!'s, do's, do-not's on web site management and net-publishing.The only reason why I am giving 4-stars rather than 5-stars to this book is that I find the print qualities of photos somewhat lacking. The visibly grainy color prints in the book are not doing the full justice to the heavy quality paper that the publisher and the author chose to use. The web version photos tells how much more beautiful they can be. Unless Kaufmann learns how to do it better, Philip should consider switching to Amphoto or something for publishing his next web + photo book."
5,"Unique and useful, a Web management book like no other","Given how many books are constantly being produced about Web production of various kinds, it's wonderful to come across something which is actually unique.Look at Greenspun's take on server operating systems in chapter 8. Never have I read such an honest and useful real-world contextualization of Windows NT and UNIX. It's a wonderful breath of fresh air, and very typical of the book as a whole.Mixed in with this technical and management wisdom are wonderful photographs by the author which seem to remind us why on earth we work and publish in the first place.I strongly recommend this book."
4,Putting The Web Into Perpective,"I just finished Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing, and I truly enjoyed the book. Philip kept my attention throughout, a major feat for such a technical subject. More importantly, he successfully described the Web from so many angles that, well, all I can say, is that the light bulb finally went off in my head. Something now makes sense, and I have already begun using my 7 years of Oracle background to publish Web pages using PL/SQL (I'll start with what I know)."
5,A Useful And Beautiful Book !,"Philip Greenspun's book will convert even anti-technologists to intelligent Web site design. If you want an innovative, insightful, funny, beautiful-to-look-at (those pictures inside are worth a book in and of themselves) compendium on Website design, this is the book for you."
5,"Ask not what ""I could"" do with the web but what ""we can do""","This book helps readers envision what the web can do when our thinking about possibilities is not captured by proprietary technology. It illustrates in very practical terms how a reliable server works, how to attract and hold users' attention, and how to reduce the overhead involved in designing, hosting and maintaining a web site that's actually useful. More importantly, it inspires readers to think on their own, and offers them concrete tools to help them in that process, about ways to ""share what they know and learn from what other people know"", as the author's own site proclaims."
3,Good book despite rants,"An excellent book for getting started with all aspects of web publishing and setting up web sites. The author takes a relatively dry topic and maakes it very entertaining. This book is geared towards the relative novice and if you have even moderate experience in this, the book tends to drag at times.One major caveat, the author has very strong feelings and states many opinions as if they were facts. Take EVERYTHING that he says with a grain of salt. There are many things that he says that I don't agree with (are wrong!) and after he rants on about them for pages and pages, even I begin to doubt myself."
1,high level to the point of being useless,"This book is nothing more than greenspun ranting about the web. there is nothing useful here. nothing. for some reason the author thinks that TCL is the be all and end all of building websites, which is ridiculous. Greenspun's recommendations on what not to buy are not bad, but don't buy this book if you're looking to actually build a website."
5,Easy to understand and follow,"""Philip and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing"" is wonderfully written and easy to understand and follow. The examples are simple to follow, and Philip offers good visuals on his web page. The material is comprehensive without being overwhelming. Even is one is not building a web site, but on a planning team, this book is well worth reading."
4,An superb guide to a survivable web-philosophy.,"This book is one of the best I've *read*. I can't say that I've *ever* read a web publishing book cover to cover before. Pitfalls and no-no's of the web publisher are clearly identified with amusing anecdotes thrown in for seasoning. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in an online presence. Not only high-end users, but the common man will get loads of useful information from this tome."
1,Esoteric Nonsense,"If you've got work to do and most of us do, then find another book... this one won't help you. Full of esoteric blather."
2,"Some good, some bad","The one point Phil brings up that I heartily aggree with is that Computer Science is a religion. While he does bring up some good points and gives good advice when designing a DB-backed website, he spends much of the book proselyting his own brand of religion (AOLServer + TCL + Oracle) and one comes away with the impression that his book is a thinly-velied advertisement for his company, ArsDigita. This would be fine if the title of the book was something like ""Using the ACS to build websites"" or ""Using AOLServer with TCL."" The actual title of the book suggests something that should address web design in general."
3,The book is too heavy,"The copy I have is printed on this obnoxious glossy paper, which is 1. too heavy for me to hold the book as a bedtime reader for a long time; 2. too reflective that all the ceiling light/table light bounces from the pages directly into my eyes, and I have to hold it at weird angles to read it.I guess the photos in the book require some high quality paper; but the quality of the photo prints is still abysmal.Yes, I have read many books on this kind of paper. Sorry for letting out my frustration on this particular one. But I figure it's such a good book that it can afford to take a dent."
5,Ten years old but still awesome,"Greenspun has always annoyed me as being too arrogant and self-important. Maybe that's true, but I've been reading this book recently, and though some of the technologies are dated (well... except that we're all still using Unix/Linux and SQL, and fighting Microsoft and the banks), the philosophy is still right-on. The writing is sharp and funny. And every technical book in the world should have irrelevant-but-interesting photos of the world scattered through its pages. Sure, you can download a copy for free, but buying the real thing costs just a buck or two now, and it's a book that's fun to sit down with a paper copy of."
4,Beautiful Book,"Philip Greenspun is the creator of photo.net and a very entertaining author as well. This a great book for beginners to get an overview of web publishing, online communities, and databases. Some of the specifics of the book are a little dated but the concepts are not. I often refer back to this book for ideas and inspiration. The online version of this book is free, but the print edition has great glossy pages and is packed with gratuitous, full-color pictures from Philip's image library."
2,"Amusing, but sadly dated","Greenspun writes well. He gives a good, clear explanation of web development and e-commerce. And the jokes are often funny.But - the world about which he writes no longer exists, and possibly never existed. This book is about as dated and as irrelevant now as those ""how to survive the Y2K catastrophe"" things that were all over the bookstores before December 31, 1999 and in the trash on January 1, 2000.I suppose, like other dotcom executives, he's writing his ""what went wrong"" memoirs now."
4,Good movie,"Even though this has a made for tv look about it it's a very fine effort. Filled with twists and turns keep your distance win leave you satisfied with the time spent viewing. it has elements of sex,actual violence,betrayal,mistrust and realtionship troubles which leaves the players in the movie going aweful lengths in order to get their inter and intra personal selves in order.I recommend this."
4,"Interesting movie, much better than expected","I'm not into the thriller genre, so I would never have watched this had it not been for Christian Kane. So I ""made the sacrifice"" and watched it to see what I knew was a great scene with Christian and his real life band (at the time, some changes since then)singing in a bar.I was pleasantly surprised! Basically rich boy (Christian Kane), wants to marry good girl girlfriend (Jennifer Westfeldt)and she is not ready. So he pursues. Meanwhile she has casually met Gil Bellows and well... you can figure it out from here. Gil's wife has some interesting hobbies, Christian's father plays a role in the background, and in the end, it works more as a drama than a thriller. Let's say these people are all alive at the end, with all their limbs, something I don't expect from reading the box.Totally worth watching, and triple that if you are a Kane fan. ""Sean Voight"" singing is fantastic."
5,The DVD arrived in a timely manner. I think it was the wrong choice of DVD for me however.CCl,"The DVD is okay but it is not my particular type of presentation. I love to see and read books about Native Americans and the world they live in and their spiritual world. However, I think this sort of DVD is for a younger person or one not in my age range or level of familiarity with these types of movies. I would not recommend it to my friends unless it was for their grandchildren.CCL"
1,Save your money,"This is so disappointing. One of my favorite movies is Thunderheart with Graham Greene so I bought this. What a turkey! Bad acting, bad script- Save your money"
4,Spirit in the Slot,"Good quality. Quick Service!Video in excellent, It realistically portrayed the problems and culture of the Native American -- one thing is its use of steam-of-consciousness technique -- this was excellent in portraying the myths and legends of Native peoples -- many of which were even new to me."
5,good for its time family oriented,A native bike racer turned horse racer when given to his dad on the reservation! There he meets (adam beach) and the two just dont get along. He soon falls for a girl which the other guys not too cool with but in time everything works out.this movie was pretty good not my fave adam beach movie but aye you know!
4,"If you liked ""Smoke Signals............""","This a very good movie with much of the same stars as Smoke Signals. The story line is also very similar......A young Anishinabe man comes to grips with his grandfather after learning it was he who caused a fire that killed his mother and the father of another young anishinabe man. The other young man is played by Evan Adams. The journey in Smoke Signals is replaced by a horse race storyline, and the two young men are rivals instead of friends. Other wise this is very similar. Not as good as Smoke Signals, but a good movie if you take it on its own merits. A little high priced at 25-26$."
5,A Moral to the Story,"Most of the movies today are filthy and downright vulgar, lacking any values or morals at all. I can't beleive that's what ""most"" people want.This movie is a great story and has a moral to it. I'm sure you'll enjoy too."
5,Loved it,"Despite other negative reviews I though I'd go for it because of Graham Greene. Don't buy it if you're after adventure and thrills, but it's a quiet, well acted story of Indian youth-but it is a tad predictable!"
4,"Relevant ""Viral"" Marketing Ideas","""Communities Dominate Brands"" is a great reference for anyone attempting to develop market reach to connected mobile device communities of young consumers. It describes how to invite today's mobile device totting tech savvy 20 somethings to your products or services, -because conventional advertising isn't working. There's good background on the genesis of this community; and, how it socially evolved with relevant advances in technology, especially mobile devices."
3,"Good (even hot) topic, but poorly written","I have an issue mainly w. the format, and secondly with repetition throughout the book. The format is of a text book and they keep repeating almost some of the same phrases over and over again.Since I am very interested in the subject matter though, I kept on reading it."
4,A great description of a high dramas,"As english is my second language (I'm from Quebec), I can't judge the deep quality of writing as others reviewers did. But I can confess that I was absolutely captivated by Curran's sharp but intimate description of K2 1986 fatal summer. His posture of total witness is the main fundation to this shacking book. Curran lived almost directly every event - and foremost disaster - that occured on the mountain at that time (Barrard death, the first climb of Magic line, Casarotto's last breath, Britain flop on the north-west ridge, Al Rouse and Kurt Diemberger stubborn persistence, the atrocious august storm on the shoulder which killed Tullis, Emitzer and co., etc.). Some corners may be fast taken, but most of the stories are describe with an unbelievable authenticity. I read it twice, and a third is on the way!"
4,A factual account of the mighty mountain,"This book goes into great detail into how the mountain was first ""discovered"" and presents in a factual and unobtrusive way the major expeditions that have been mounted to the mountain. It outlines the differing tactics employed by each expedition and discusses the internal politics of some of the more famous expeditions. If you are the sort of person who loves the adventure of the mountains from your armchair, this is probably not the book for you. If however you feel drawn to this ""mountain of mountains"" and are fascinated about all the things that have made this mountain so difficult and exciting, this is your book."
5,"A book about mountain, tragedy and people","This is an outstanding book for those who want to have a first understanding why K2 is such a challange and why it is called the Savage Mountain. It is an geographical and historical review of all the relevant facts about K2. But what makes this such a great book is the fact that as you begin to understand the ""what's"", ""why's"", ""when's"", and ""where's"" about K2, the book pictures a live portraid of a mountain, and the reader feels like K2 is almost like a live beeing. It is interesting how can one person admire, hate, love and respect a mountain like if it was another person."
5,it is one of my favorites,it is a good video and it goes with maxi and jem to of my other favorite shows that are animated
4,A deeper travel book...,"Nick Danziger here goes deeper than his previous outing in 'Danziger's Travels'. Again he travels to disparate corners of the globe, but here he focuses more on the people he meets there, and on the wider significance of their lives. The book has some great photos by the author, and ultimately asks the reader to reflect on their place in the global scheme of things. Certainly as a Western reader familiar with some of the places in Britain and abroad he writes about, it is often an uncomfortably truthful read."
2,Unmoving,"A sequel to Nick Danziger's original story of travels through Afghanistan and other foreign lands, the book was unmoving. This work seems to be an attempt to capitalize on the limited success of his previous work but fails to capture the excitement or imagination of a true journey."
3,Dissapointing,"This is a somewhat disappointing follow up to ""Danzinger's Travels"" which utterly lacks the cohesiveness and compelling tale of that earlier book. There are interesting tidbits here and there as the author skips back and forth from Afghanistan to the luxury lecture circuit, with occasional forays into Tijuana and New York life, but for the most part I was left unmoved. There are some horrifying first-person accounts of the tragedy in Afghanistan, and an interesting chapter about Ayatollah Khomeni's funeral, but one's time is better spent skipping most of these musings."
2,"Outdated, myopic and not useful","This expensive paperback in not illustrated. While Prof. Wickens has a distinguished history at Kew, his sense of economics of plants, understanding of plant utilization and the hard facts of introducing little used methods or plants is uninspiring. Specific points are the introduction of urban hydroponics in Cuba, the roll of coppicing and pollarding for fuel, the indisputable utility of commercial hemp for food, fiber and fuel, that all seem to have escaped his notice. The statement, ""The amino acids are a large class of organic compounds containing both the carboxyl, COOH, and the amino, NH2 group"" while technically correct is naive. The utility of the book is enhanced by donnish word origins but otherwise has little to recommend it."
4,Fantastic book.,"Everyone should read this book, man and woman. It's a great book teaching christian men how to be men, and it's time-proven. Not old fashioned, but just common sense. It's pure and true!"
5,happy,I received my order in a timely fashion and in new condition. I am very happy with the service I received.
1,Utter nonsense.,"Perhaps the most outlandish and misguided book ever published on the subject. Despite an appealing premise, the writer fails to deliver anything resembling a guide for a successful marriage. In its place, we get ultra-conservative hogwash that will surely doom any couple to an unhappy marriage. Indeed, no self-respecting woman will tolerate a husband who accepts Andelin's advice. Written by a dentist, the book recommends a course of action that will prove more painful than a visit to his dental office. This book would make a hilarious read if it were not meant to influence naive young men. Get ""Letters to Philip"" by Charlie Shedd, or anything else on the subject, instead."
1,Pure cornball,"I read this book back in college and just kept thinking to myself, how corny is this guy. does he live in Mayberry and know Andy and Barn."
3,somewhat conflicted,"This book left me with very mixed feelings. To begin with, I got into the plot fairly quickly, which says a lot, seeing as how i am afflicted with ADD. Anyway, the most important thing to me, what i was expecting and hoping for, was a thought-provoking story. That, I got. I had to put the book down every five or so pages and think on it for a minute. Not too many books do that, so i was impressed. However, i never go to the point in this book where it made me see something new, a different perspective, or a point i'd never considered. Perhaps i had my hopes up too high, but the author's intent seems to be to show the reader just how absurd our society's stress upon looks is, but all she really does is point out the obvious.This is a well-written, entertaining book that needed to be done, but i think Kit Reed could have pushed the envelope more. She is definately capable."
1,BORING,"I'm not sure who this book was written for, but I only managed about 30 pages before giving up. I couldn't follow it. My only questions? How on earth did it get published?"
3,"Fast paced, but...","+JMJ+This book, I thought, was fairly fast-paced, good at building the story and the mystery of what's happening. I enjoyed the book, right up until the ending. My thought, as I finished the book, was ""Did the author get tired?"" Did she get tired, and just decide to abruptly finish the book? Because, sincerely, that is how it seemed to me: a cop-out. So, even though I enjoyed the book, the ending stinks."
2,Baby talk for those who miss storytime witn mommy,"This book is baby talk for those who miss storytime with mommy. There is more text devoted to fictitious scenarios that don't impart any understanding of accounting, than to simple and thorough explanations of accounting. The author introduced new terms without explanation, and skimmed over new concepts with scant explanation. That's frustrating after slogging through fictional Bob the plumber's feelings about his fictional red truck's motor.I'm an adult, and I'm busy. Get to the point. I bought ""Financial Statements"", by Ittelson -which is much better so far. Also, ""Schaum's Easy Outline of Accounting"" -which hasn't arrived yet. However, Schaum's Physics book was sparse but very good and I'd expect good value in terms of time & money invested with this book too."
4,Fast-paced fun and a great collection of short stories,"Fans of Daphne du Maurier will appreciate this varied and engaging collection of nine ""twisted"" short stories. Some stories are better than others, but who cares when it's a short read? All demonstrate du Maurier's unique ability to capture the atmosphere of her settings. Included in this collection is the chilling original story ""The Birds"", which I especially enjoyed reading, having seen the Hitchcock movie several times. Another favorite was the at times hilarious ""The Blue Lenses"". Overall, this was a very fun book!"
5,Comfortable,A very comfortable alternative for larger busted women who hate underwires. I want more...
1,Great until you wash it!,"I suppose I should have hand washed this bra, but, I never have done that with any bra I bought before. I was so pleased with the fit of this bra...and then I washed it. It shredded!!"
3,I wonder why there were no Jews in the Middle Ages,"The illustrations are wonderful. But every culture in the world, from Incas to Arabs to Englishmen, get at least one illustration and one explanation. There's an illustration of a church, a minaret and a Moslem school. Jews were a strong presence in the Middle Ages throughout the world, so the omission is glaring. I suppose the striking difference would be the extent to which Jews approached a near-100-percent literacy, even then. But given that the merchant who might have sold the cloth to that woman with the cone-shaped hat might have been Jewish, perhaps it would have been truly illustrative of Medieval life, since Jews were required to wear distinctive clothing wherever they went.The effect is to show a book with deficiencies."
3,"healing,health and faith",I thought it was an interesting book. There is a lot of great information to help you get your VICTORY!
4,Good but sad,This is such a great movie but ends so sad. I saw it on Lifetime today and at the end I was crying so hard it was kind of making me sick. The best thing about this movie is you know that this woman really really loves her daughter. Great movie.
5,For Widow on the Hill,This was one of the best lifetime type dramas I have seen. It is also one of the most disturbing. The behavior of this woman unsettled me so that I have been trying to find out what the final conclusion was on the internet. I have been unsucessful thus far. I know of other situations in real life where a spouse was accused of murdering (or attempting to murder) their wife/husband...one of which happened down the street from me (von Bulow in the 1980's) yet this is more chilling.
4,Piano and vocal selection of The Apple Tree b Jerry Bock,"The Apple Tree based on the diary of Adam and Eve is a short musical. Usually performs with The Lady or the Tigar and Passionella.This selection involves Feeling,The Apple Tree ,Beautiful, Beautiful,World, What makes me love him?,I've got what you want, Oh,to be a movie star, Gorgeous (The lady orthe Tigar?) Wealth ,You are Not real (passionella)I'm lost.Easy piano arrangement and songs are not difficult.Feeling and Beautiful are lovely and everyone will enjyoy singing."
3,Would not pay retail for this,"I opened the package for this, took the case out and immediately put the item back inside! I returned the item due to it not fitting the phone, for one, and two because it is poorly made."
4,THE ROAD TO NOWHERE,"Promoted as a ""horror"" movie, ENTER NOWHERE is more akin to an episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE or OUTER LIMITS.The low-budget film focuses on three strangers brought together in an isolated cabin with no apparent reason. As the story progresses, bizarre time and place inconsistencies emerge, setting the stage for the arrival of a fourth character who brings clearance to the mystery.Director Jack Heller does well with the miniscule budget but doesn't elicit strong performances from his youthful cast. Katherine Waterston (Sam's daughter) is the most effective as the demure Samantha, followed by Sara Paxton's coquettish floozy. Scott Eastwood flounders in his role as the heroic Tom, while Shaun Sipsos doesn't have a lot to work with.I applaud the movie's originality and its connection of a tricky plot.ENTER NOWHERE is a nice change of pace from tiresome retreads and sequels."
4,great movie !!!,loved this movie...ok even tho u kind of figure out what kind of is happening its still a great movie....acting i felt was solid...i really liked sara paxtons character...she did a good job.....really liked the story with its little twists & turns.......kept me very entertained...this movie is worth the watch...........
1,Worst I've ever seen,"This movie was terrible. I didn't expect great, but I didn't expect the worst either! The plot, the acting......everything was horrible. Don't waste your money!"
2,Just okay,I liked it at the beginning because it had me guessing but then later on i had a feeling what was going to happen. I have seen something similiar this many times. It was okay for me.
5,YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!,"I was fortunate to preview this film at a private screening. Enter Nowhere is both terrifying and suspenseful. The script is incredibly well written. The cast is phenomenal. In particular, Sarah Paxton (Jody) proves her acting chops and how versatile she is as an actress in this role. I highly recommend this film."
1,Likely to ruin young Mr. Eastwood's career!,"Rarely have I waited to watch the end credits of a film merely to get the name of the writers. But I did with this huge piece of excrement. I wanted to send them a hate letter dipped in stench.This movie was created by a director and writers with 1) no life experience, 2) no talent and 3) no future. I am sure my hate letter will go to the writers in their new job flipping burgers.The film's concept is absurd, the dialogue does not rate a student film and you will rue the day you ever sat down to watch this mess. I mean ... you will REALLY hate yourself.His appearance in this piece of crap is likely the only reason it got made. Maybe the principals behind the movie are his friends? Well, they won't be for long. They just unmade young Mr. Eastwood's career.And to make matters even worse for the viewer, the Eastwood boy doesn't even take his shirt off."
3,B movie from the twilight zone,Acting gets a C-. Production a C. Direction a C. This could have been an episode of the twilight zone. The movie is entertaining just keep expectations low.
4,Amazing!,"Absolutely worth watching. I would consider this a drama/thriller all the way, not horror at all. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Fantastic"
5,Very satisfied,Like someone else said- how much can you say about a bubble envelope except that they are good quality and the price is very reasonable.
3,Nice product for the price even with thin paper,"I mean the price was excellent for 100 envelopes. The purpose (to send small items I list on Ebay, Etsy and Listia) was fulfilled. But I found myself using extra tape to seal, and secure becasue paper would tear pretty easily, and When writing address on envelope a couple of times, the pen poked through. But if you are gentle, use labels, and extra tape, it will save you some money"
3,Nice Watch,"I like the watch, but it is a little larger and heavier than I expected it to be. It is also a bit large for my wrist and have not been able to size it."
5,"""Red Shoes""","One wonders if there has been an increase in the sale of red shoes...in all sizes...following the publication of this book...? Red shoes exemplify Hannah's zest for life. As adults, Hannah's story reawakens our own desire for zestful living, our own need for ""red shoes.""Even though my son Jim died at the age of 23 rather than 3, Hannah's joyous spirit reminded me very much of my son as well as of the many children whose parents I've been honored to meet (following the death of their children).Maria Housden's gentle prose distinguishes this book from many books written by bereaved parents. Hannah's life, rather than her family's grief, is the primary focus of the book. Hannah taught her family great lessons on ""how to live life more fully."" Hannah's legacy continues as readers learn much about life, death, and grief through Hannah's example.This book should be on the bookshelves of bereaved parents, nurses, physicians, and all caregivers."
5,Best Aida ever.,"This Aida is great from beginning to end. It is cohesive, thoughtful, well stages and costumes are gorgeous without being cliche.Love it."
1,A Cheap-O,"I bought this Aida because of Cheryl Studer. She did not disappoint. Luciana d'Intino as Amneris lent credibility. The rest stunk. I expected more from the Royal Opera House. I cannot imagine worse staging: meaning-less background screens, and poles with silly emblems. Radames had black hair. After he was sentenced to death, his hair turned completely white. Edward Downes' pace was uncoordinated with either the chorus or the singers at spots. The worse part was the intended triumphant scene. It was Eurotrash, with top-less acrobats jumping around. Verdi would turn over in his grave. As a final insult, Kultur managed to mis-spell Cheryl Studers' name.The Aida to buy is the one by Kate Aldrich, Adina Aaron, and Scott Piper. It is beautifully done, guided by masterful mentors, Franco Zeffirelli and Carlo Bergonzi."
2,wooden production,Very disappointing production. The singing was OK but the staging and acting very less successful than other productions of Aida that I have seen
5,A Must Read for Any Breast Cancer Patient,I had spent countless hours researching the different reconstruction options when I was fortunate enough to read about this book on the Young Survival Coalition's message board. I immediately ordered it and was amazed at the clear descriptions of the procedures. I also loved the section that guided you on how to prepare for the surgery. I can't say enough about this book!Jennifer TomFounder of Positively Pink Packages
5,Constant Companion,"This book became my bible during my recent surgeries. So much so, that I broke the binding reading and re-reading it. It offers something for anyone remotely affected by decisions surrounding breast reconstruction. In a world where we can sometimes find too much disjointed information on the internet, this book nicely summizes the facts with an appropriate level of detail. Thankfully, this book was available when I needed it!!"
5,Breast Reconstruction Guidebook,"Excellent book. Very informative, so much so that my plastiic surgeon will be ordering a few for his other patients. Knowledge is power and this book will replace the fear with empowerment."
3,"Review of The Breast Reconstruction Guidebook, Second Edition","I think this book is good and it is helpful but it seems maybe a little outdated. Of course, keeping up with medical changes is quite a challenge. It would have been more helpful for me if I could read about the various types of surgeries in a more categorized way. Sometimes the implant surgeries and the flap surgeries are spoken of at the same time and the issues are quite different. But overall, very good. B"
5,The World Is Filled with Mondays...and Baseball!,"This has Peanuts comic strips from 1994. When I first read this book, I laughed for a long time! It was also my first Peanuts book and now I am hooked!"
4,The most complete guide,"This is a very useful book if you work in the HDTV industry. It is a handy tool for me, as it points out concepts that are rather new and not so easy to understand even for skilled engineers, like HDTV timing."
4,Good Book,I think this is a good book for begginers. It's very easy to understand and there not trouble read.
1,Buy this book if you already know about digital imaging and Video,"I wanted to learn about Digital Video and bought this book. I had some very basic understanding of related concepts. Even with that I found it difficult to follow this book.I think Charles Poynton knows about his subject well but the way back and forth references are used without explaining a concept completely makes you feel you have not understood something completely. For example,Page 50 of book will start introducing a concept on lets say interlacing. And then it will have a note saying that ""I will explain more on page 400"". When you go to page 400, it will have a note saying based on the fact on page 300....So if you want to buy this book and read it, better make sure that you have good basics on Digital Video and related concepts.Thanks"
2,Not easy,"I bought this book to understand basics and fundementals , it's quite organized and has a lot of info. in it , but you must have a good background to keep on reading and even you must have a lot of refrences to go back to while reading this book, at the first chapters there are instants that you need to go to chapter 16 to read then come back, I say this book is wonderfull if you have a good solid background ( mathematically and numericaly in Video standers and transforms... )."
3,"Very useful, but ...","This book is undoubtedly useful for any practicing video engineer and for anyone seeking to familiarize themselves with video standards and technology. It covers a broad range of topics under one cover. Depth is lacking in most parts, but then this book is not intended to be used for theoretical study. It is a handy guide to have at one's desk.My biggest and only complaint is about the way the material is presented, which, in my opinion, is highly unstructured and makes the book much more difficult to read than it needs to be. In almost every chapter, the author asks the reader to refer to the material in both future as well past chapters for details. As an example, the section on nonlinear image coding, on p.12, refers to the material in different chapters on pages, 197, 198, 203 and 257!Nonetheless, despite this writing flaw, the book is recommended."
4,Contains lots information but not easy to read,"This is a technically good book about video engineering, but it has two flaws:1. The writing is many times not very easy to understand, there are many sentences that don't make too much sense to me. I am not a native English speaker, but I have spent last twenty years reading and writing in English.2. There are terminologies poped up in one place, and there is no explanation for those, many times the author asks you to read in later chapters, for a reader who is not familiar with the material, it is difficult to read and confusing.Overall, it is a very good book, but you need an introductory book before you can read this book."
4,WHHOOAAA!,"This one would make Marilyn Chambers blush! A ""blue light special"" from the french ""Third Republic."" See what your great-great-grandfather was up to! Put the kiddies to bed and turn on this triple XXX vintage pleasure - just don't say you weren't warned!"
3,Interesting,"The video and audio are similar to an old Charlie Chaplan movie. Apparantly it was illegal at the time this movie was made, for women to shave any part of their body. This is the kind of thing you get for someone who has everything and you have no gift ideas. Gramps would enjoy this."
2,Very poorly constructed,"The 1930's were fairly early in the film industry, but nowhere close to presenting an excuse for this disappointment.I purchased the 1930 and 1940 vintage erotica. Both were surprisingly lacking, especially the 1930 disc. There is simply no context or narration to even understand what you are viewing.This is definitely low budget. Don't buy unless you are curious and flush with cash."
1,Disappointed Big Time,"This DVD came highly recommended by O (Oprah) magazine and from several Amazon reviewers as well.We were suppose to be amazed at the French and how comfortable they were with sex and their bodies, etc. We were suppose to be aroused by bodies not enhanced by cosmetic surgery, etc. The actors seemed uncomfortable and made sex frantic, silly, not romantic or erotic. They seemed like X rated Keystone Kops at best. The picture on the cover of the DVD was beautiful and promising. But the DVD made me feel awful and had the oposite affect that I had hoped for. I did not think I would recover my libido ever. I couldn't get the horrid depictions of sex out of my mind. The bodies were not natural and beautiful, they were gross and ugly. I ff to the end hoping for something for my money, but alas, it was not there.I only wish someone had been more honest, especially Oprah's porn reviewer, in evaluating this film."
4,Let's eat French!,"A joyous celebration of unimpeded, unhindered sex. This DVD consists of 24 short silent B&W films from 20's and 30's France featuring various singles, couples, and groups in -- well, almost every possible combination, actually. Sure, they're just ordinary people, with the lumps, cellulite, and excess hair that ordinary people have; as such, I found it a pleasant antidote to the ridiculous excesses of modern porn. It also gives some explanation for the French reputation as lovers: every straight coupling starts with getting the woman off. Now that's what I call feminist!Be warned; it's very explicit and includes lesbian, gay, straight, and group situations, as well as quite a number of cum shots. (Not that there's anything wrong with that...)"
3,"Good, but worth $59?","I got this free w/ my Fresher Longer set (which is great). You will notice a different in a small bathroom with a bleach kinda smell, so I guess it's working. A large room you will not notice the diffence.When I cleaned it there was black stuff in it. Almost soot-like. Makes me wonder if I have a mold problem as we don't smoke. But, we do cook a lot.I would not pay $59 for this, but I am temped to try a larger one."
1,already stopped working,this item is poorly designed and very unreliable it stopped working the first time I cleaned it according to the instructions and there was no recourse since the company has stopped selling them
1,Save your money,"Of all the purchases I have made in my life, these were absolutely top ten. I didn't notice any benefit, and I wonder if they did anything at all. Bascially worked as a night light."
1,Poor quality and performance...,"I have had a very similar experience to another person who rated this product. It doesnt work that well, and I have got the burning smell also. I actually had blue sparks in mine when I plugged it in. Sharper Image also took mine back with no problem. I do not recommend this product."
1,STAINS YOUR WALLS,"THE PREDECESSOR TO THIS UNIT STAINS THE PAINTED WALLS. THIS ONE PROBABLY DOES THE SAME THING.I HAVE AN IONIC BREEZE QUADRA COMPACT THAT I REALLY LIKE. WAY BETTER CLEANER THAN ORECK. MAYBE IF YOU LEFT ORECK ON HIGH SETTING ALL THE TIME, IT WOULD CLEAN BETTER. BUT THE NOISE FROM ORECK IS LOUD, EVEN ON THEIR QUIET SETTING.BUT, I WOULD NEVER PUT AN IONIC AIR CLEANER CLOSE TO A WALL. BOUGHT ABOUT 6 OF THESE FOR LAUNDRY, 3 BATHROOMS, AND 2 HALLWAYS. EVENTUALLY THE DIRT THEY ATTRACT STAINS THE WALLS. FORGET ABOUT CLEANING THE MESS, YOU HAVE TO REPAINT.I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE THESE ON A PAINTED WALL. I DID KEEP ONE FOR MY MASTER BEDROOM. ONLY BECAUSE THE RECEPTACLE ON THE WALL HAS A MIRROR AS A BACKGROUND. MUCH EASIER TO CLEAN."
3,Gz20090504,Not what I expected. This is interesting the first time but since it has no story line it gets boring on subsequent viewings.
5,A gift to humanity,"Walter's reading of the Mozart Requiem is said to be the classic one. But you'll find several versions from his hand on the market. This surely is the best. It has a far better choir than the Vienna Philharmonic-set (who conducted that awful choir??) and the soloists are magnificent, both Seefried and Simoneau at the peak of their powers. But what classifies this recording as outstanding is of course Walter's conducting. He knew better than anybody what this piece is about. Norrington, Hogwood, McCreesh, Gardiner etc., this is a question of music - music of the highest order - not about being authentic or not."
2,Bruckner's Te Deum fails to move the listener as it should,"This is a remaster of a 1953 performance that may have been a great performance, but not a great piece of audio recording. The distant microphone placement fails to deliver the depth and power of Bruckner's mighty Te Deum."
5,The most complete book I've seen on IP Multicasting,This 600+ pages book is the most complete I've seen on IP Multicasting. Goncalves and Niles are known for thoroughness. They did the same with their other book IPv6. Excellent job!
5,A marvelous recording of a great piece.,"Though I have not experienced the wide range of recordings of these works that the previous reviewer has, I fell immediately in love with this recording. The work itself is wonderful, full of dynamic colour and a great range of emotions and sounds. But the recording is what pulled me in. A perhaps more sentimental Walter (I have heard much of him) does add a slightly darker and richer feel to the works, but the effect is very nice, especially in the last bars of the New World. The orchestra is in peak form, and Walter directs them incrediably well, in spite of the fact that he has aged. He just seems to be able to feel the piece, which he somehow manages to infuse with energy. I strongly recommend this piece to anyone who likes Dvorak and/or Walter."
2,Not so good,"Listened to the 3rd and 4th movements of the 9th symphony, and found the entire experience uncomfortable. The tempos get uncomfortably slow for my taste, the orchestra lacks dynamic range and tone. I hate to bring it up but there are even some glaring intonation and ensemble issues (listen to the sample of the 3rd movement, trombones) - those looking for a solid recording of the 9th should look elsewhere."
4,Just like the book says...,"A new book by my favourite author was a definate must, even though it is a cook book. I wasn't dissapointed. The scene is set with a flashback to the part in whichever book the meal came from, making me go and start reading them all over again. The recipies are fantastic, easy to make, and taste great. Next time Kay Scarpetta whips up some of her fabulous pasta, I'll know just how good it is!Only negative thing... I can't get Key Lime Juice in Australia!"
4,Great Gift !!,"I love this book!!! It is so easy, the instructions are easy to understand and knowing that it came from a fiction book just puts it on a different level.The bad thing is that I do not have Kay's kitchen so everytime i want to make those yummy recipes, i have to go shop for some specific items..!"
2,food to die for,Not as great as I thought it would be. I love cookbooks but was a little disappointed in this one.
3,For the SUPERFAN,"If you are a PC superfan I am sure you will like this book. It would make a great gift. I was not inspired by it, or the recipes and I actually like the Kay Scarpetta books. As a gift, great, as a cookbook.... I don't think so. And it just seems too ""full of herself"" of Mz. Cornwell."
4,Wow,"I am so glad that I ordered this book. Now personally, I am lucky to boil water without burning it, but I actually made the Jack Daniels Chocolate pecan pie and it was great!!!!! Mark yet another good book up to PC."
4,cooking,I love Kay Scarpetta and this just gives it another twist because you can cook like her ......
4,Copland's Simplicity,"I ran across the Copland sonata and this performance in the early 1970s. I was ambivalent about chamber music at the time, but the beauty of the piece won me over. The stark simplicity of the second movement was unlike anything I had heard before. The climax of the final movement echoes Appalachian Spring in mood but the triumph in the sonata seems somehow harder won.The Hindemith and the Bloch (particularly the Bloch) are well worth hearing, too.The CD either reveals a bit of the original's sonic limitations or wasn't done perfectly. You don't notice after the first 10 seconds, but that's the reason I only rate this 4 stars."
3,Worth it for the photographs alone,"I agree with everything the other reviewer said, the photo history presented is quite superb. I remember reading that the author and Mr Gurney did not get along at all well, hence the lack of interviews."
3,Dan is disappointed he wasn't consulted,"I bought the book a year or so ago. Enjoyed it but when I went to AAR and talked to Dan, he mentioned that he was disappointed that he was not asked or consulted in any way. I felt as though I let him down by buying it. It does have excellent photographs and appears to be well written."
3,Worth it for the photographs alone,"I agree with everything the other reviewer said, the photo history presented is quite supberb. I remember reading that the author and Mr Gurney did not get along at all well, hence the lack of interviews."
3,"Five stars for the photos, ooh baby! Text? What text?",I got this book as a birthday present and I can safely say this is one gorgeous picture book. Let's face it - people will buy this book for Antonio's photos and well-chiseled body. The workout tips aren't anything not featured in countless (cheaper) men's magazines before.But those photos! Ooh yummy.
4,PLEASE....,The reality is we all know how to lose weight -- eat less and move more. The fact is this book is simply about Antonio! These are some of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen of him. Come on -- that is really why we want the book :) and it is worth every dollar!
3,Not Bad!,"Despite the fact that he has all of those stupid pic's of himself his workout is actually tough. His workout is at least 45 min long and I only did about 8 min worth of it and it wore me out. All I did was a shorter workout of his and it made my upper body feel like jelly. I don't think his workouts are that bad. The workout involves supersets done in a circuit training fashion.But the part I didn't like about the book is that his workout isn't for the beginner. It's too intense for a beginner to go for 45 min.Overall, the workout in this book ain't bad!"
4,On target!,"This book is informative, interesting, and provides solid information. As a middle aged man, I could have done without all the ""cheesecake"" photos. However, he provides a unique way of workouts. I have done this for a couple of weeks and the workouts are tough. I end up lifting weights less poudage wise, but seem to be getting better results due to the intensity. For people who have been active, this book is ideal.On the negative side, Sabato makes you figure out which body exercises to do. I would have preferred seeing sample sets for given days. Also, the book is expensive for 144 pages. Had it been less or if Amazon would provide a bigger discount (and beat their competitors-hint!) I would have rated it 5 stars."
5,Terrific Thriller,"There are only three characters in THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED: two kidnappers and the rich young woman that they grab for ransom. Most of the story takes place in a single setting, the apartment where the criminals hold the girl captive.Not wanting to be a spoiler, that's all I'm going to reveal about the story of this smart, fast-paced British thriller from writer-director J. Blakeson that is filled with some very surprising plot twists, as well as superb performances from Gemma Arterton, Martin Compston and Eddie Marsan.This is, indeed, one of the most intense, grittiest caper movies I've seen in years, and I cannot recommend it too highly.Michael B. Druxman"
5,I hope your seat has a comfortable edge.,"Excellent film! ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" successfully mixes compelling characters with an intricate plot. From the title, you may correctly guess it has something to do with a kidnapping, but little else. I recommend you know as little as possible about this movie before you watch it, just as I did. I won't spoil any of it for you, but I can't think of another movie that kept me on the edge of my seat like this one. There are so many great ""what will happen next?"" moments expertly woven into the plot. Nothing ever felt forced or unrealistic. The characters were believable, interesting, and wonderfully acted. Five stars, no doubt."
5,"Unexpected turns, semi-original, Alice Creed delivers the goods!","I've seen several ransom/kidnap movies in my time, but this one took some directions that I didn't expect. In fact it took several! Definately one for the library. I'll spare you the repetition of how impressive the film is, everyone on here has displayed that plenty, because overall I agree with them. I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. Suffice to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, hence the rating. If I'd had bought it first, I would've been no less impressed."
4,"Myopic, taut, Quirky","Ah, the Brits! The thinking cinephile's 90 minute quiz but with quirky British plot twists. The rather punctilious methods are an alert to simpler failings, such as individual motivations and dominant human fears: loneliness, abandonment. With a cast of three, a disproportionate responsibility for carrying suspense falls on each actor's character, but in independent film fashion, it holds interest with a nice measure of suspense, albeit, somewhat predictably. While it won't enrich your life, it's entertaining and fashioned into a single, cohesive dramatic fabric. One caveat for Americans: depth rather than superficial violence and tawdry sex prevails. Begs plausibility at key points."
3,Somewhat entertaining British crime drama.,"""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" is a low-budget British crime drama that starts off in a very exciting manner. Two young men are setting up a soundproof room that will hold a hostage that they are planning on kidnapping. They kidnap Alice Creed and bring her into the room. While the title of the movie suggests that the plot concerns the search for Alice, it actually deals with what happens in this apartment over the next few hours.There are a couple of twists that come early, and add to the intrigue of the film. However, as the movie went along, it didn't live up to the promise. While the acting by the three leads is very good, the movie limped along near the end. I enjoy watching crime dramas because they tend to have very exciting endings, but ""Alice Creed"" ended with a relative whimper. Overall, I would say it's worth watching, but don't expect a fantastic crime thriller."
3,Old Plot With A New Twist,"""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" was a slow, somewhat boring old plot...BUT with a new twist...and that is what kept me tuned in when I almost tuned out. Alice comes from a rich family and the movie failed to provide enough info on the rich family, which had me in doubt about the reality of that. The kidnappers were in their own gay lovers drama, while trying to pull off a major kidnapping. One of the kidnappers knows Alice and once the details start to unfold...a new twist...kept me watching. The ending was not predictable for me, which was another plus for this movie."
3,Great and Pointless,"With brilliant cinematography, great screenwriting, and good acting, this film has everything. Everything, that is, except for a point. The visuals are simple yet still compelling; the plot twists keep you glued to your chair; and the few characters in the film are believable, but if you are looking for deep meaning in a picture, this is not the film for you. Though there was plenty of opportunity for some big ideas and some underlying themes due to the intimate theater feel of the piece, the writer/director falls short here and without comic relief, a true romance, or other pop movie crutches, the film suffers for that."
2,"Come on England!,","Almost, but not quite.Not sure about the twists and turns either, saw them coming at me like a truck.As a made for TV drama this would have been top-notch. As a feature film it falls short in most every department.Nice try."
5,Very good crime procedural,"There is not much to add to the generally good reviews for this film. I happened to watch this movie right after watching a very dissapointingly bad film, so I was doubly appreciative of how good this movie was. I only find it unbelievable that 4 people gave this film only two stars! The acting was exceptionable (try to find a more scary kidnapper than Vic!), there was a well thought-out script, good directing; what else do you need in a thriller? The beauty part is that it remains a mystery as to what Danny's real agenda was had not everything happened as it did. We know what he does in the end, but we do not know what he would have done had everything gone according to plan. No Hollywood-style explanation!"
3,Could be 4 Stars with some editing.,"If only Alice Creed wasn't so annoying, maybe I would have a bit more sympathy for her situation. OK, that is not completely fair. ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" has good bones. There are twists and turns that I was not expecting and suspenseful moments. There were also some long drawn out moments of not a lot of plot or long conversations which didn't appear to move the plot along. I fell asleep twice towards the end where the film became more psychological thriller and less action. If you are into character conversation and development in your suspense films, watch it."
4,Twist-y and Thrilling,"Honestly, the name of the film had me expecting a ham-handed, boring, b-movie. Maybe something with a couple shocks and poor acting that went straight to DVD. I was pleasantly surprised by a film with great acting, great character interaction, and some genuinely entertaining twists. Besides Gemma Arterton, I was unfamiliar with the small cast, but Martin Compston and Eddie Marsan make for a dynamic crime team, with many layers to their relationship, slowly peeled away as the film progresses.It's a solid R rating, buyer beware for interested families or teens."
4,Plenty of Twists and Turns,"The Disappearance of Alice Creed is a simple movie, we only see three different characters thought the whole film and ninety percent of the film takes place in a nondescript room. But that is the mastery of the acting, directing and the writing that they can take such simplicity and still make a compelling hundred minute movie. The plot is also simple, two men kidnap a daughter of a millionaire and hold her for random in the before mention room.And then the twists start to happen. The first one can be spotted from a mile away, and I got a sense that it would happen from a moment Alice Creed first comes on screen. The second one: not so much in that I had to rewind to believe that I saw what I just saw. But by the end there are so many twists and turns you begin to expect them and start think maybe the writer went with one too many of them. But the movie is still compelling enough that it is still worth giving it a look to see how many twist you can see coming."
2,And K9 makes three...,"The Doctor and Leela have entered the TARDIS' secondary console room when it is entered by a mysterious force, which effects the Doctor. He takes the TARDIS to the Bi-Al Foundation, a space hospital in orbit around Titan, for his own treatment. Little does he know that he is effectively the Trojan Horse for a malignant virus...A pretty stock standard story which, aside from its 'Fantastic Voyage'esque section, has its main claim to fame in the introduction of the robot dog, K9, who joins the TARDIS crew at the end of the story.Terrance Dicks adaptation is not terribly inspired or inspiring, and may even represent a low point in Doctor Who novelisations."
4,Me and Rumi,Me and Rumi is a rich book that explains Rumi's life and his spirtuality. i highly recommend to read this book/
4,Best Cheese I ever tasted,"I tried this Diana Supreme Teleme Cheese and it was good but not as good as the Teleme Cheese I tried in Los Banos, California from a Company called Peluso Cheese Company. They sell a Teleme Cheese under the label ""Tomales Bay"" Peluso Teleme Cheese and it was the best cheese I've ever tasted. The cheese was soft a little running and a great nutty taste. It's the best Teleme Cheese around the western states. I researched the company and it so happens to be the company who started that type of cheese back in 1917. Try it and you'll like it."
4,Remarkable,It shows the power of meditation and the long-lasting effects. I was impressed with the meditation group's abilityto utilize their new-found self.
4,"Amazing, but what is it?","I've heard of vipassana and would like to learn how to do it. This film shows dramatic evidence that it works. From what I understand, it's rare that any prison or counseling program effects real change in inmates (or in those on the outside, either). How many people do you know who truly change?So, an amazing film.However, I thought this film would have been much better if it had explained, even if just the basics, of what vipassana is and how it changes people. They talked alot about vipassana, and showed people doing it (sitting) - but what is it? You watch these amazing results but have no idea what caused it.I have to assume this film is for people who are already vipassana practicers. But it leaves the other 99.99% of us in the dark.(If anyone can point me to a video or audio course teaching how to do this, please tell me in the comments section of this review.)In short, an amazing film. But also maddening to the uninitiated."
2,"its the seller, not the product","Terrible communication from the seller auto barn led to me being strung along over a month when my order was actually canceled a couple days after it was placed. I ended up getting what I believe is the same product from Oznium.com but I can't really be sure since I never got these. If they are the same, the product is 3/5, durability could be better but for the price just order a few more, you'll always need led rocker switches for something..."
1,The Emperess Wears No Clothes.,"What do I mean by that? I mean this show is a farce. MTV tells all of the morons that watch their idiotic network (that no longer has any connection to music) that Tila Tequila is this hot commodity. Have any of you really looked at this haggard supertramp? Tattoos on her biceps, slightly below average looks, no education, no class... come on. If that's what you want head to Times Square."
2,Wrong color,I ordered white and was shipped yellow... I could get the yellow trace easily in my area... the whole point was getting it in white. Returning it was not an option.I will not be ordering from this distributor again.
3,"Slowly,Slowly.","He starts well,immaculate phrasing ect,then he like all performers gets wired up to the audience,gets excited,this in turn makes him sing faster,excellent for most artists it gives there delievery that extra edge,""LETHAL"" as far as he is concerned.why? becauce his trademark,or that special magic he has whatever it is,of making you believe every word,is only achieved with snails pace time! there are musicians out there who will tell you,that he had them play slower time again than they taught possible.""THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WORKS FOR ME GUYS "".Only at this snails pace can he work his special magic otherwise its lost."
1,Potentially dangerous design flaw,"I bought this cooker at a big box store and have been using it for about 2 weeks. I cooked a large pot of rice for my dogs yesterday using the time delay feature. When I got home yesterday, he told me that the rice cooker had exploded! Apparently, the steam vent on the rice cooker had gotten clogged with rice gluten, and the cooker pressurized, causing the lid to pop open and rice to fly everywhere! If someone had been standing there when it happened, they could have been seriously burned! The steam vents on this unit are easily clogged. If you use the unit, do not cook a full 10 cups of rice!"
3,It's okay for a bargain price,"Bought this at a discount box store - perfect example of ""you get what you pay for"". For a bargain price, this does an okay job on brown rice; however, there is zero indication in the instruction manual about how long brown rice takes to cook. Reviews of more expensive cookers said as much as 2 hours....this one takes about 105 minutes and does the rice pretty well. I'd change it to 3 stars if amazon would let me...$30...and of course, now it's available in stainless and black at the box store."
4,Just as good as her last one,After listening to her first CD I had to get this one too. Enjoy it very much.
5,Great CD!,"I have all of Terri Clark's CDs. She is a remarkable entertainer. Staying true to herself and not following others in her industry to pop, she continues to show her fans and others just why she is so loved by her fans. Terri is the epitome of womanhood in it's finest form. This is just another of her fine works."
5,Fun and energetic!,"I love Terri Clark, and this is an excellent album! All of her songs are great on here, and my favorites are 'Emotional Girl' and Poor, Poor, Pitiful Me.' Her slower songs are pretty, too. What can I say? Terri is just fantastic! I'd recommend this album. Happy listening!"
2,"Book, booklet might be a better description","I was extremely disappointed when I received this book....I guess that's what you get for not reading the description...48 pages, that are half the width of a regular book, the size of a small booklet."
1,The same worldly arguments were made to Noah...but he kept building the ark,"""...Scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, and saying, 'Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.' For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water. But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. "" ~2 Peter 3-7"
3,Not new remastering,"Bad news for reviewer Michael Allen, but the official sources confirm these are the 2001 remasters - none have been done since, so if you have the 2001 album reissues, they will sound exactly the same as this. This is just another repackaging job."
3,My Wife Asked Me To Get It For Her,"Well, at 72 I can remember Abba. That's OK too, I guess. But, the reason I bought it was because our grand kids like it, or at least my wife thinks they should. Anyway, what the heck. I haven't anything against Benny, Bjorn and the gang. So, enjoy. As it happens, I went down to the local flea market and to tell the truth, there wasn't much Abba to be had on old Lp's' So, there you go, I bought the CD. Can't be all that bad. If someone gets a kick outta it, well, great. Waterloo is my favorite. Best regards, Ray."
4,ABBA,I ordered this CD after seeing the ABBA movie. It contains all the hits that I was aware of as well as a couple I had not heard. Excellent.
3,pleasure to listen to,"After watching ""Mama Mia"" just had to get this cd, A real pleasure to listen to"
3,Something new? Anyone?,"The stars I give are, I assure you, for the songs themselves. I have been an Abba fan from the beginning and bought the 45s, the LPs, cassettes and CDs. But this is getting to be a little much. We get repackages of THE SAME SONGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN! Come on now, all the fans know that there is a lot of suff in the vaults just waiting to see the light of day (the oft-bootlegged ""Just Like That"" comes to mind), not to mention demos and alternate takes. I know that Benny & Bjorn are perfectionists but it's been long enough. Let's hear some 'new' Abba - it's not like the original songs are going to vanish. Heaven knows we have enough copies of them."
5,CD ABBA,"I LOVE the CD. And your service was excellent. I will be a steady customer.Thanks a l,000,000 -MarciaSan Diego"
5,ABBA CD,"This product was as good as I expected. After seeing Mamma Mia I wanted to be able to continue to enjoy the great songs, and this CD provides me this opportunity.The process of receiving the product however, was less than satisfactory, and I am not sure that I will be using Amazon.com anytime soon for my purchases. It took almost 2 weeks to receive the product and until the day before the product arrived I received very poor customer service. I do appreciate the customer service person that I spoke with the final time - he was VERY helpful and offered the refund of the shipping costs."
4,Disturbing the Priest!,"Don't get MAD at child-abusing priests, get EVEN, with KILLING FAITH by Keith Gouveia. This book--or at least its theme--is sure to spawn an army of imitators, since it really IS torn from today's headlines. Fueled by the trauma of pedophilia, a serial killer targets wayward priests as a detective races to stop him. The conflict is cranked up a notch when the killer becomes possessed and loaded with destructive supernatual powers. There is a LOT of violence in Killing Faith, and it won't make you proud to be Catholic, so be warned. Still this is KG's best work yet--packed with horror, suspense and controversy. It'd make a HELL of a movie!"
5,What a beautiful mirror.,"After looking around for a mirror to add some ""umph"" to my living room wall I discovered this one. I wasn't sure what it would look like but when it arrived I was very happy . The quality is excellent , it is well constructed and built to last for years.The only problem you may have is that the back of the mirror has two metal hooks that allow you to hang it on your wall but I prefer the wire back to secure it to the wall , so I purchased some of the picture hanging wire and added it myself.Other than that it is a ""statement piece"" on the wall and brightens the whole wall. I absolutely love this mirror and would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Lovely mirror, wrapped great, still had a chipped piece","I have been looking for a mirror like this one for the last few months. Based on the other reviews I decided to order it. The price certainly was great. It arrived quickly, and was wrapped very professionally. It took me some time to get it unwrapped, and of course, it is just as lovely as everyone else describes, and is very large and impressive. But when I inspected the mirror a little more closely, there was a chip along the inner edge of one of the small pieces that outline the central mirror. After inspecting it carefully, I don't think it was damaged in transit, it was shipped this way. I am going to keep it because I really do love it, and am hoping I can hang it in such a way that no one will notice the chipped section."
4,GRTSTUF!,"Square in the Face by April Henry is the second in the Claire Montrose mysteries. It's a heart grabber when Claire starts looking for a matching marrow donor for an old friend's dying son. In the meantime Claire's mother is buying everything her new best friends on TV's home shopping network are selling. Lots of family secrets! This is a wonderful story with terrific characters. I loved Charlie, Claire's roommate. It is fun watching Claire rediscover her family, too. Humor, a little love interest, lots of intrigue, and some sad history, too. As with any mystery, the 'bad guys' leave their mark but our Claire is not going to let them get away with it. This is a strong follow-up to Henry's first book, Circles of Confusion, and moves this series onto my 'must buy' list. April Henry is a sharp young writer with ever-increasing skills, a superb imagination, and the wit to use them well."
3,An easy read,"This latest book by April Henry is a quick and easy read. An excellent book for an airplane trip or the beach. Slightly better than her first book Circles of Confusion, Square in the Face still lacks the depth and ""completion"" to be a ""great"" mystery. There are trails leading in all directions and not all of the answers are forthcoming. Still, this book is fun entertainment and worthy of a relaxing read."
3,Less then Perfect Watch,I have had this watch about 3 weeks now. The black around the Bar and Shield is worn off already in places on each one.... Just not what I expected from Harley Davidson or Bulova....
5,Blue zerran,"Wonderful product received many compliments for my silver hair. Concentrated shampoo not color, a beautiful Silver highlights. I always try to buy the 320z for it last about a year."
5,The real Frank Nitto.,This is a very well written and acurate account of Frank Nitto. Nitto is either typecast in movies or ignored in most accounts but Mr. Eghigian Jr. shows that he was in fact a major player in the Capone gang and the gang leader after Capone. This is a must read for those seeking the real Frank Nitto.
5,The Enforcer Unveiled!,"Myths are dispelled and years of mystery settled in this enlightening, entertaining, and highly readable account of Al Capone's successor, Frank Nitto, a.k.a. Frank ""The Enforcer"" Nitti. Mars Eghigian has uncovered the real Nitto, who was neither Al Capone's cousin nor Paul Ricca's puppet but a shrewd, quiet criminal businessman able to consolidate the Chicago Outfit and expand their operations after the fall of Capone and the Repeal of Prohibition (the underworld equivalent of the stock market crash). Forget Bruce Gordon's comic heavy in ""The Untouchables""--Nitto has emerged at last from the shadow of Big Al."
2,its ok,It's a good book if you want to read all about Frank Nitti from the view point of the authorities. There are not too many new stories in this book from people who were around Frank Nitti; it's mostly the same old stories that have been printed a million times. But it is put together well and it is still a good read. I just don't understand why all these new mob books are coming from people like Mars Eghigian that have no connections to any mobsters for the good and new stories.
4,(5 stars if you are from the U.P.) this is a must read,"If you are from the U.P. this is a great book. It is a collection of short stories that depict the U.P in the early 1900s. Incredibly funny and witty. The author establishes characters that portray real people from the U.P. Finns, French Canadians, etc. come to life before your eyes. You won't want to put it down. If you have left the U.P. --- the book will bring you back."
2,Snooze... not the best book on this subject,"There are vastly better books out there for natural beauty recipes. This book, unfortunately, is an ego trip for the model-author, with often impractical or unimaginative recipes."
4,Great Teaching Tool,"Not since ""School House Rocks"" has a teaching tool been so useful in reaching history students across America. As a teacher, I have used the ""Hip-Hop Approach to U.S. History"" with great success and educational outcomes. The CD is a great supplement to the history curriculum, with a different perspective of historical events that is not usually found in our current history books. Catchy, historically critical, and very easy to use, this book and CD will enhance any student's insight into U.S. history. Listen to O.D.W.M. to get a good sense of what Flocabulary is all about."
2,Great concept- didn't grab my students or me,"This sounded like a fantastic resource. When I played it in class,however, neither I nor my 8th grade students wanted to hear it again. If they aren't listening, they won't learn from it. I thought it was too ""hard"" and loud, and, surprisingly, my diverse class of students did, also."
3,"No subtitles, just english","I bought this for my dad for father's day, it is a great movie for that time and he loved, fortunately he speaks and ready english very good coz there are no other langauges for subtitle available."
3,'The Three Stooges Meet Hercules' (Columbia Pictures) Running time: 88 minutes,"Now, this 1962 Three Stooges feature film actually isn't half bad. I thought it was hilarious when the three knuckleheads are mistaken for gods. 'Three Stooges Meet Hercules' simply isn't as 'lame' as a couple of their other feature-length films. Call me narrow-minded but I still much prefer their twenty-minute shorts. I mean - even Shemp had his moments. It didn't hit me until later, but maybe the reason this flick isn't great is because Moe, Larry and Curly-Joe (Joe De Rita) was already over the age of sixty + this movie was most likely aimed toward a weekend matinee audience."
3,an ok movie? why soitenly! nyuk nyuk nyuk,ok before i say the bad things about the movie there are some good things1.an ok villainthe bad things1. not that much violence2.not a very good battle with the villain3. just not classic stooge matireal4. there getting old.
2,If your a stooges fan... buy it...If not...Don't bother,"The only reason I thought this movie was even slightly good was cause the stooges were in it. I've only watched it twice (that means it's bad, other stooge movies/shorts I've watched 20 times or so) and the movie in my opinion is horrible. It had a very bad plot, but even at that I think the Stooges did good, it's the writers who need to come up with something a little better than meeting hercules..."
5,Nyuk nyuk nyuk....,"This is quite possibly the single greatest work of that great comedy troupe known as ""The Three Stooges"".Laughs and more laughs from start to finish. If you are a fan this is the one title you cannot do without in your dvd collection. In fact, the price is so reasonable you should buy extra copies for your friends and family."
5,The Best of the Stooges features,"This movie is the best of all of the stooges movies made in the late 50's and early 60's. Of all of them it captures the spirit of the classic shorts which made them them one of the longest lasting and most consistant moneymakers (at least for their studios) in the comedy business.The plot is simple the boys aid a geek trying to build a time machine while keeping the villian away from his girl. The result is a trip to ancient Greece, a meeting with the legendary Hercules and the changing of the Geek to a man.Pure unadultruated fun. a real winner."
3,I like it,There are only 3 video clips and there are all nice.I would have like it more if there was more material
5,Mr Bacchi,"This CD brought back many memories of the time I was courting my wife. One selection on the CD was the one that made my wife say yes to my proposal of marrage. She is gone now, it means so much more to me now."
1,too oily,"I found this product too heavy on my hair. I use it along with Dr. Bronner's shampoo, and I feel my hair oily right after it's blow dried. Plus the scent (I bought the original one) is so strong it doesn't even smell clean or fresh. I will use it until it's gone but I just can't wait to go on to another product."
2,Not Good for African American 4c/d hair,"I have very coarse, dry natural hair and this conditioner did not moisturize my hair but it did leave a sticky residue on my hair, in my shower, around my tub, on towels and everywhere else I put my hair while it was damp. I could have gotten the same level of conditioner from pantene or aussie. For the amount that I paid I expected more. Not reccommended."
5,Satisfied Customer,My teenage daughters and I are transiting from a perm to natural. Our hair is soft and manageable and we mix it with coconut oil and aloe Vera for an every other day cream for our hair.
1,alcohol,"So disapointed!!! I read info about Ingredients, and decided to buy this conditioner. Then it come it has the differents Ingredients like Aqua, cetyl alcohol, alcohol denat!! so bad for my hair!!"
5,Wonderful for fine hair,"I have fine, wavy hair, and this GPB conditioner perks my waves up and brings them to life each time I use it. Since it really is heavy on the protein, I use only use it once a week. I apply a thick amount, clip my hair up while I wash my body and shave, and then rinse it out. The heat helps it permeate and my hair ends up much curlier than it was before washing it.You can also use this as a deep treatment if you leave it in longer and sit under a hooded dryer or use a blowdryer.It's also Curly-Girl-friendly for those who don't use silicone or sulfate products.The only downside is that the herbal scent is really strong, so you have to be sure to really rinse it out well if you don't like it lingering in your hair. Sometimes the scent tends to linger, even though I thought I'd gotten it all out.Overall, this is a great conditioner, one that is a Holy Grail product for me."
3,"Ok, but not what I thought","This conditioner is very thick, almost like glue and hard to get out. Did not work well in my transitioning hair, but I love the product line; just not this one."
4,Great Light protein,"Definitely worth trying, great for a light protein for women with chemically relaxed hair. I usually used under a shower cap to keep the moisture in...will have to try without it too!"
4,You've never heard this before,"Those eager to hear something really unusual might want to check out this CD, a homage to Albert Schweitzer that combines the music of Gabon, Africa, with that of Bach. Schweitzer worked in a hospital in Lambarene, Gabon, and, as you may know, was a Bach scholar and organist. While, the concept sounds almost as bad as Roy Orbison tunes performed in traditional Celtic style (there really is such a CD), surprisingly it's wonderful music. The disc's best pieces combine excerpts from Bach's St. John Passion with Gabonese percussion and chants. It's truly amazing how well such disparate music blends. The track ""Sankanda"" which features incredible vocals by a Gabonese woman combined with a chorus singing a slowed down and rhythmic version of ""Lasset uns nicht zerteilen"" is simply stunning."
2,Not a good fit,"I'm not sure what Bach ever did to deserve this treatment. What we get is an overlay of Bach with African music, much as one might hear going down a street with radios playing on both sides. A cello gigue in triple meter against drumming in some unrelated duple time, for example. I don't know what one reviewer found sinister about cut #6, but this is the first time I've heard ""sinister"" applied to ""Herr, unser Herrscher.""If you want Bach, buy Bach. If you want African music, buy African nusic. This pastiche (whose justification you'd never guess if it weren't for the too precious liner notes) just doesn't work."
5,Lambarena,"Talk about crossover--look up ""multicultural"" in any dictionary and you will see this album cover. Jaw-dropping in effect and so simple in concept. Do you want to ""come home to a place you've never been before?"" Give this one a spin. :)"
1,ONE interesting track,"3 stars for the fourth track, which showed some promise, but -1 star for everything else on this CD in which Bach's music is merely SUPERIMPOSED on African music, with nary a hint that the African musicians are responding in the slightest way to Bach's music.Except for the one track, it's clear to me that the African portion of the CD was recorded completely independently of Bach's music, and that the ONLY cross-cultural collaboration came after the African tracks were recorded, when the two producers (one French, the other Gabonese) tried to figure out how to now combine some Bach with the African music. To me this approach is completely misguided.On track three -- which shows what the album might have been -- it's evident that the two percussionists, Nana Vasconcelos & Sami Ateba, are actually hearing the opening to Bach's St John Passion, and are responding to it. Purists will certainly still hate it, but with an open mind, it's actually fairly interesting."
3,Lambarene-Bach To Africa CD Music,This CD was recommended by a returning Peace Corps Volunteer and it is what I thought it would be. Interesting music.
3,Low budget thoughtful low key commedy,"I watched this DVD with very low expectations, realizing before viewing it that it was a low budjet movie. The story is that of a twentyfive year old guy, that has moved away from his home town to LA. He returns home as he find out from his friends that one of his best mates is getting married. However there is a snag: his best friend is getting married to his ex-girlfriend from high school. From here a story develops that is part comedy, part reflection on growing up, friendship, love and the nostalgia that is always shared with people we have been close to in our younger years.This is not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed watching these carachters at work...Almost every single character reminded me of someone I knew in real life. The friendship interactions feel quite realistic and I got more and more involved as the movie progressed, after a lukewarm start. A good movie for an otherwise boring evening with nothing to do."
1,"good idea, poor execution","Bagdikian manages to take an important subject -- deserving of sober and careful analysis -- and buries it in a shrill, overwrought and largely useless diatribe. His general thesis, that the mass media are undergoing consolidation antithetical to consumer interests, is beyond serious debate. Yet the book is so bereft of serious analysis and scholarship that the case is hardly to be made out. For the wholly naive this book may, perhaps, open some new vistas. But for anyone who regularly gets past the sports pages and comics there is little here of interest."
4,The press has become the lapdog instead of the watchdog.,"You know, it's interesting if not frightening, at the concentration of ownership of the mainstream media, and that one of the owners ,Dan Quayle, (see Indiana and Arizona Newspapers and radio stations) commentted, upon return from a Latin American junkett, that he wished he would have studied Latin more in school. I think the only salvation of our liberties, in this day and age may be in the simplicities of the Dan Quayles, running the corporate medias, truly, without a clue. One hopes, that, with the merger mania, there is not some evil plan to merge until there is one corporate feudal company, and our job description is, SLAVE. But we are entertained! Truly Brave New World is upon us. Keep the Net free. It may be the last bastion of freedom of the press, let alone the mind."
3,"""Fifth"" edition is misleading - needs updated facts","Interesting and worthwhile book needs a major update. Many things that were facts in 1977 - 1982 are no longer true. This hurts the book. Please - Beacon Press - don't let something be called a ""new edition"" if it is only slightly updated!"
2,Should have been better.,"During the opening scene, it appears to be a very action packed movie, but the action is hard to follow sometimes because of the close ups on the fighters. I could not get a good feel for the movie because of this. I thought Donnie Yen could have done a much better job with his skills, but I was not impressed. If your looking for a good Donnie Yen movie don't look here. Try Iron Monkey or Sword and Butterfly, the latter may not show a lot of Yen, but what it does show is damn good."
4,A really great budget optical mouse,"This mouse is really great. It moves really smooth. There are no problems at all. USB/PS-2, two buttons and a clickable scroll wheel. This is a USB mouse and it comes with a pluggable PS-2 to USB adaptor.I'm not too happy with its shape. It is a little longer than it should be and has a flat hump, that doesn't fit your palm nicely like other expensive mice do. The scroll wheel's texture is not as smooth as it should be. These are just the only trivial problems I could find."
3,Works good,"Works good, not particularly fond of the shape, but not bad. Bought a classroom full of them for 6 bucks each."
4,Optical Mouse Review,"I liked the Labtec Optical Mouse, it was well priced and provide the right features. I like the Optical feature, so there is no roller ball and I also like the center wheel. In fact, I will not purchase a mouse without the center wheel. Overall, it fulfilled my need well and at a good price."
4,Behaves funny !,I bought this mouse about 18 months ago. It worked fine for all this while. Now its behaving funny!It is double clicking everything. For e.g. if I click on a mail in my outlook espress - I want it show it in the preview pane but now it opens a fresh window of that mail. Many such instances.So I guess it doesn't last tooo long. But great mouse for as long as it lasts.
5,The REAL Optical Mouse for a REALLY LOW price!!,"I just recieved my new Labtec Optical mouse that I ordered and I must say I love it! It is just as described! The ""Real"" Optical and a nice scrolling wheel on the top of it. I compared prices from my local department stores (like Walmart..ect) before I bought this and their prices were much higher for an Optical mouse. I have to say, I highly recommend this mouse to anyone trying to get rid of all the hassles from the wheel mouse."
3,Uncomfortable,"I usually not one to nit-pick or complain but like others have said, its shape makes it a bit uncomfortable.I am not a fan of microsoft, but there mouses and keyboards are pretty good.Other than that the mouse works really well. Accurate and simple. nothing more nothing less. I guess if you are ordering many of these for workstations its fine, but for personal use its irritating. Maybe its my mousepad..."
2,Give 'em enough rope,"The mouse itself is fine. Fits the hand well and is responsive. However, the cord is about to 2 feet short than the ball mouse that I was replacing, so it just didn't work out for me set up."
4,Good choice,"I purchased the Labtec Optical Mouse recently and I am very, very pleased with the performance. It does not matter whether I'm using the mouse with the mouse pad, on the desk or floor. The optical eye is great compared to the old fashioned roller type. I feel like I've arrived!"
5,My New Mouse,The mouse I received was great! It arrived fast & works good! I will be shopping with this company again!
5,Scardy Cat!,What a fun plant! Growing well - and the animals avoid it and any plants close by. The seller sent it promptly and transported it well. All plants in good condition when received.
5,plants received,"the plants came in a timely manner, were in good shape and are growing nicely. Am not sure that it repels cats, dogs and bunnies, but time will tell!"
3,i don't think its working.,I bought 2 plants . My garden is so big may be that's why it didnt work for me. I'm really tired of cleaning cat poop from my vegetable garden!
4,favorite memory,I had forgotten about this movie until I came across it on 'on demand'. It was one of my favorite teenage movies - I graduated from HS in 1972 - and wanted to run away to California and find the perfect love & the ocean. I didn't. Still a sweet movie. Kay Lenz is soooo sexy.
4,A May December romance with a little nudity thrown in for fun.,"If you'd like an older man, let him look like Bill Holden. He would be my ideal of a hunk. Imagine him making love to you. Now, tell me what would happen if the tables were turned and if Breezy was 40 and a young Bill was 20, would it be as interesting a story. Maybe."
4,1970's Revisited,"This movie is somewhat of a time capsule of the hippie generation in Southern California in the early 1970's, coupled with a May-December relationship between the youthful Breezy and the middle-aged Frank Harmon.It's a nicely done story, although the spiritual purity of Breezy is a bit of a stretch considering her homeless and vagrant past. Still, this is a movie worth seeing because it represents a fond era that no longer exists."
4,South Korean Army Story,"This South Korean production emphasised on servicemen's barracks relations embedded from a notion of mutual attractiveness and harsh reality of behavioural issues this country's movies present usually.Same gender affairs, suicidal, violence topics have in modern drama been depicted."
5,Poignant May/December romance,"Superb film. Eastwood captures the good and bad in this romance between 50ish Frank and Breezy (18). Realistically portrays the guilt Frank feels. This one has a happy ending, so different from most similar stories."
3,"Great film, but it never came in the mail.","Yes, I had seen this film prior to purchasing it, it's actually a marvelous film as I'm sure other reviews on here can tell you. However, I'm making this brief and only giving it three stars out of the five I would've given it, except that my DVD never arrived. At all. I don't know if the seller had anything to do with this or if something happened along the way, but I'm not pleased. And I ordered this months ago, I think somewhere between October and December would've been a nice time for arrival."
4,Key Lenz becomes an actress/William Holden still hanging in there,"True this is no ""World of Susie Wong"" nor ""Picnic"", but Holden's still good if you can believe his role. I was part of her era. This is a charming little picture way over-the-top as far as hippie Breezy is concerned & Holden as the older/unhappy/shallow man. Parts Are truly insufferable - the dog ""Sir Loves Alot""? Give me a break... It's fun/simplistic/a fairy tale & I became a life-long Kay Lenz fan..."
3,"May and December meet, and sparks fly.","Well, to my mind, Breezy is a minor classic. Perhaps the foremost May-December romance film - that I'm aware of. Kay Lenz's first starring role. She's maybe a little over the top, but it works as a way to illustrate her ""free spirit"", which yanks William Holden out of his post-divorce funk. Breezy (Lenz) is a penniless hippie and Holden's character is a wealthy real estate agent. Seldom have two people been so mismatched, and that makes it fun. It's hardly a great film, but the relationship between these two extreme opposites may jolt your impression of human possibilities a tad. So suspend disbelief just a little bit, and enjoy the time-machine trip back to 1973."
2,Beware - full screen version cropped to fit widescreen,"Here the studio cropped the top and bottom of the full screen version to make it fit anamorphic widescreen format, so you lose more of the picture than the full screen version.Universal is deceptive in not saying picture has been modified to fit your 16x9 inch widescreen tv's. This is not a true widescreen and should state that the original apect ratio was modified to fit 16x9 tvs.Cool movie though, and the transfer quality looks very clean on DVD. It Just is a shame to have to sacrifice watching a movie that chops off the image of leggs and heads, or ground and sky!"
4,Good book,This book discusses a topic not many people like to talk about. It will answer all of your questions for you
2,LACKS PROPER REMASTERING; BUY THE INDIVIDUAL CD'S,"Although the packaging for this set is lavish, the sound quality of the earlier tracks is very disappointing. ""Evil Ways"" sounds like it's coming out of an AM radio station, and the tracks from ""ABARXAS"" don't sound much better.Fans should skip this set and buy the first 3 Santana albums that were remastered in 1998 (which sound better than even the Mobile Fidelity CD's).Those 3 CD's also contain extra live tracks from the era of the original album's release that make ownership a must.In addition: Columbia/Legacy has released the first Santana album as a ""Legacy Edition"". Expanded to two discs, it delivers the first album, remastered again in 2004, with additional session tracks; the first, discarded recorded sessions for that album, plus for the first time, the entire Woodstock performance set."
5,joe 1317 from boston said it all,"I could not say it better myself. Joe 1317 from boston described this set in a few sentences. Not only is this a great diversified collection of santanas material, it is an outstanding showcase for the many talented musicians who played with him over the years any santana fan should own this collection"
1,Dance of the Rainbow Serpent,Ordered weeks ago and didn't receive. Paid w VISA. Contacted seller--christycali777--to check ship date and seller said CD was damaged and didn't ship and indicated she contacted me thru paypal which I never use....won't order anything thru this seller again.
3,nothing special,"they do look good, works when you don't wanna look too casual, but still wanna wear thong sandals.but not that comfortable on the foot."
3,Solid Roundup of Soulful Classic House,Deliveries what the CD title & subtitle promises. No hidden gems but a nice solid roundup of soulful classic house.
1,Wrong Product Pictured,"This is not a CS50-USB, a wireless VOIP/Speech recognition PC mic. This is a landline telephone mic. Big difference."
2,"A snooze, but a change of pace for Presley","The second film in which Elvis plays a character named Walter (the first was ""Kid Galahad"", ""The Trouble With Girls"" is a snooze, but a worthy addition to the King's filmography if only because it represents a complete change of pace from most of his other 1960's vehicles. Set in the 1920s, he's the manager of a travelling tent show rocked by assorted scandals, and he's surrounded by a cast of solid professionals (Vincent Price appears in a cameo). Slim, relaxed, and impeccably dressedin a white suit, Elvis looks better here than he has in a decade, and it's no wonder. By the time this film entered production, the TV special that would represent his return from the ashes of low-budget Hollywood pap, was already in the can, and he had only one more movie to go (""Change of Habit"") before bidding adieu to the film capital that saw him as nothing more than bait to reel in an often undiscriminating teenaged audience."
1,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS THING!,"This is certainly the WORST movie that Elvis had anything to do with, unless you count the final televised which can be just as disturbing and difficult to watch at this ""ATOMIC"" bomb. I enjoyed SEEING the sweet little Anissa Jones, John Carradine, Dabney Coleman, and Vincent Price, but beyond that this movie is absolutely unbearable. Please avoid even VIEWING it. Bottom of the trash can, literally."
5,Glad to see it on DVD!!,This is a great Elvis movie set in the roaring 1920's.I'm glad to see that it will finally be released on DVD along with his other great movies!!
3,Better than average Elvis vehicle,"I found this to be quite entertaining. What raises this above the usual dreadful Elvis movies is: the cast is better than average (Marlyn Mason, Dabney coleman, Sheree North, Vincent Price, etc.), the songs fit the context of the movie and there is quality not quantity (of songs). Elvis got mired in light musical comedy - more often than not it didn't work. If he had only made a few movies of this quality (and less like Paradise Hawaiian Style and Girls, Girls) I don't think his career would have suffered so much. I agree with another reviewer about the quality of the picture and disc - a good reissue. Worth checking out."
3,His Best Post-Formula Flick,"It's funny to consider a movie title suggesting the SAME OL'-SAME OL' ELVIS MOVIE, when the actual movie is such a success in a new arena: it's Elvis Presley in an admittedly light but enjoyable old-timey comedy/drama with decent tunes. The project was previously discussed with Dick Van Dyke in mind, and that would have been interesting, but he couldn't touch Elvis on ""Clean Up Your Own Backyard"" - just kidding. (Actually the anachronistic country blues rocker is another plus for this enterprise). The fine cast is well-utilized and the art direction is impressive. Marilyn Mason, Sheree North, Dabney Coleman and others work well with Elvis."
3,"Nice hat, too small outside!","The hat its self is lightweight and fits well. The problem is that the hat is tiny. Not the inside fit, but the outside brim and top. Looks like a bobble head hat. JMC"

4,Muy buenos productos para practicar Ingles,"Creo que los CDs para practicar ingles son muy buenos, yo los escucho a menudo en mi auto y me ayudan mucho en mi pronunciacion"
3,Good for moms of 4-5 year olds.,"I liked it, but I wasn't expecting a book written for moms of young children. I was seeking a book geared towards moms of babies and kids of all ages, but it really is geared towards 30 something, married women of a 4 or 5 year old. It is funny though!"
2,Disappointing compared to Guide to Pregancy and First Year,"I LOVED THE GIRLFRIENDS' GUIDE TO PREGNANCY AND GUIDE TO THE FIRST YEAR. She was so real and easy to relate to. After reading all of the prescribed books for new mommies, I found her first two books to not only be helpful but also humorous. When purchasing the first two for a pregnant Girlfriend, I ordered the GUIDE TO GETTING YOUR GROOVE BACK for myself. Yes, I could relate to her experiences except for the ""family bed."" When I ""Ferberized"" my daughter at 3 months old, it stuck, thank God! Anyway, I never really found the advice I was looking for, and the ideas she did have are already a part of my current lifestyle. I'm sorry, but I don't feel like this book will help anyone get their groove back. Also, I was also blown away by the lousy editing. As a teacher, misspellings get on my last nerve. They don't belong in the final copy of a book that costs $14.95. Sorry Vicki, but this book was a true disappointment to me. I was a huge fan."
1,"Good idea, horrendous writing","I loved the idea for this book, but Vicki Iovine drowns any useful information in a sea of boring personal anecdotes and terrible writing. Reading this book is like getting a phone call from that dear friend who just won't stop talking about herself. At 280 pages long, you'll learn much more than you ever wanted to know about Viki Iovine and not much about how to get your groove back."
2,Awful book- her husband should be mortified,"....since she makes him look like the worst man alive. Anecdotes about how she has to beg him to do his part as a father and how he negatively reacts to her pregnancies really set my teeth on edge. Am I the only woman alive whose husband truly cherishes his role as a father? Even worse, I put 2 and 2 together and realized the man in question is none other then THE Jimmy Iovine, famous producer. Is THAT how she was able to get this drivel published? I agree with the previous reviewer who noted the overabundance of run on sentences as well. Don't waste your money on this book:The Iovines have plenty as it is."
5,Panic! At the Disco Poster,"The poster came in great condition, and I had no problems once it was received."
1,"Oh, dear!","This is a very sad effort. If ever a song lends itself to emoting, ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE surely does! Tony Martin manages to produce a totally bland--even boring rendition. Annoyingly, he does not sing the verse, either. I must presume his first run-through is sung in Kern's original key and Martin is unable to hit the high note. On his second run-through there is a perfectly hideous, unanticipated change of key--I mean, does he have a tuning-fork in his ear?--presumably done in order for him to finally hit: ""When all the things you ARE (the high note) are mine."" It's a beautiful song and this is disappointing."
5,tamagachi handhilld camputer toy,i love it i carey it were ever i go it can be acat a dog a dinosaur
2,Chat with me Laptop,I really think that the screen could be bigger. you have to hold the laptop different ways before to can see the writing on the screen. Very hard for little girls to work with.
1,This is a waste of money!!!,Don't waste your money on this lame toy! It does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!!!!!!! My daughter was excited to receive this laptop only to find out it doesn't do a single thing and it is BORING!!! I tried it myself several times and have to say I see zero learning value and it is just the DUMBEST toy out there especially for the money it costs. It is a total waste of money! The maker makes you think it does all of this stuff when in actuality is doesn't even play a (real) song!
1,Awful,"Yea okay me again, last january I said its great and colourful you should get it. I was dead wrong. I was dieing I mean DiEiNG for it when I heard about it last summer, Well online it sure did look awesome. When I got to toyrus I saw it and looked at it, walked away. My advice: Dont buy this unless its like for a 3 year old."
5,great show,"this was a great show super interesting i dont understand how could it be canceled. The final chapter wastn that good i gues is because they had to ended in a rush i dont blame them, but this show deserved a great finale. its so sad. :(. Still i love 4400."
5,Good show that ended too soon.,I loved the 4400 when it was on and have missed it. I wish the DVD set had more extras but I love getting to watch it again. Season 4 improved on Season 3.
5,4400,"This is one of my all-time favorite shows...heroes be damned. 4400 did it better...first! The storyline is intricately compelling, the acting is phenominal, its all very much there. All of my closest friends love this show and we have talked about it and its mythos for hours. There were a few random spots where the pacing was a bit off...too much going on here...not enought going on here...a possible plot incumberance there. Still, here's to the good times."
4,WHY???? CANCELLED!! MAYBE SCI-FI CHANNEL WILL PICK IT UP.,"CAN ANY ONE TELL ME WHY?? THE SERIES WAS EXCELLENT,THE WRITING,ACTING & PLOT WAS ALOT BETTER THAN MOST OF THE SHOWS ON NETWORK TV, HBO OR SHOWTIME! IS THIS SERIES GOING TO BE PICKED UP? ARE THEY GOING TO FINISH THE STORY? IT'S NOT FAIR TO SPEND MONEY & TIME WACTHING A SERIES, THEN YOU DON'T GET THE WHOLE STORY! IT'S LIKE BUYING A BOOK, THEN WHEN THE STORY GET'S EXCITING THE PAGES ARE MISSING!!! PLEASE STOP RIPPING OFF US; THE CONSUMER'S! DVD'S AREN'T CHEAP TO BUY!! SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH THE TELEVISED VERSION, AND SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THE DVD SET! SO IF THE STORY IS NOT COMPLETE, CAN I/WE GET A REFUND?!"
2,"Slightly disappointing,","Still great effects, cinematography and all of that but I noticed the slip in storyline and dialogue quality in this season. To be honest, I am a few episodes off finishing the series because I can't bring myself to sit through the show anymore. And I bought this DVD over a year ago. I used to love this show but this season definitely slipped in narrative quality. I would recommend you buy this to add to your collection of 4400 DVD's if the price is good because the first half isn't so bad but you will notice your interest rapidly declines by the final disc possibly mostly due to character inconsistencies.I'll be generous and give it a 5/10, although I am saddened to do so as it was once my favourite show."
4,"Great show, Crappy way to end it....or lack of an ending","Nice DVD set, your standard box set. No complaints there. USA sucks for cutting the series short though, if you missed the last season and need to play catch up it's worth it, just dont expect a whole lot of much needed closure."
1,Pathetic!,This book doesn't cover half the topics that are asked in the exam. Its the most pathetic book I've ever read.Does not cover:IIS in detailNo Terminal Services (and there are tons of questions on that)No delegation of control and host of others.This book is pathetic.
2,Confusing to follow the flow,"This is just not my style of writing. The story teller throws in too many random thoughts that (in my opinion) have nothing to do with the story line. The book was selected for my Christian Book Club so I felt I needed to finish it for the discussion. Had I not had that restriction I wouldn't have lasted past 10%. When I hit 80%, the book became exciting and I had to finish it."
3,the fall of american,"did not meet my expections, seem to me some of the wording has been changed. poor inserts, hurt the book."
2,"WE'RE DOING A REUINION, HERE'S A CD....","This album, which was released to coincide with the Reunion Tour of 1996, makes this Kiss fan smell ""contractual obligation and money."" Sure, the unreleased live tracks are great, but THEY DON'T PLAY THEM IN CONCERT. The first three weren't included on ""Alive!"" because they didn't make the cut. And, for all that's good and holy, how many more times do we have to hear ""Rock N Roll All Nite?"" Die-Hards only, please."
2,cool idea...just lied to,"Ive been a KISS fan for over 30 yrs. The""unreleased live tracks"" were obviously recorded in 1996 with a live audience track pumped in. Any KISS fan can tell the difference between the vocal range/change of Gene and Paul over the last 25 yrs.The drumming is alittle too busy...the lead guitars are alittle too slick...could this be Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer? I would bet that they are playing on these supposed ""live tracks""I will always love KISS...but who do you think that you are fooling?not me"
5,kiss live,"great ""LIVE"" compilation for 96 reunion tour . should have added KISSIN' TIME,DO YOU LOVE ME,LADIES IN WAITING and HOOLIGAN, as there were played back in the day."
4,4 Nuevas canciones,"Contiene material en vivo de los dos primeros ""Alive"" y otras cuatro canciones que es lo que le da valor al disco. ""Room Service"", ""Two Timer"", ""Let me Know"" y ""Take Me"", versiones bastante mejoradas en cuanto a las versiones en estudio. Además contine una entrevista de 17 minutos a la cual no le he prestado mucha atención. Son solo cuatro canciones nuevas, pero como valen la pena!!"
3,The Best??,"For starters, I am the biggest Kiss fan, and have almost all (if not all) their material: Kisstory, Boxed Sets, etc. But, I must say I was hugely dissapointed by this album, and by the whole Kiss reunion. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the original Kiss lineup and what they did during the seventies but, objectively speaking, Ace and Peter (specially Peter) can't even be compared to Bruce and both Erics (Carr and Singer)... Bruce and both Erics simply blow Ace and Peter away!! Anyone who's had the chance to see Kiss perform live with both lineups, has to admit the striking difference, which again reveals itself in this album. As a Kiss fan, you should buy this record, but I trully must say that Paul and Gene sold out by getting back together with Ace and Peter."
2,You want the best? Try elsewhere,Ive never been a Kiss fan but ive had a few of there cds laying around for awhile and decided to give them a listen. I picked this one out and played it. The first four songs remind of Spinal Tap and I wondered what the hell do people see in these guys? Then I read that the cd was made with the audience pumped in and I lost a little respect for them after reading that. The songs are alright but nothing id pursue an interest in.
2,Don't make them even richer,"This album is a rip-off.The 4 ""newly discovered"" tracks are not vintage recordings, but new ones done when the band reunited. No one really knows if the original four are playing in them, since Kiss has been lying to their fans since 1976' Destroyer by not giving credit to outside musicians on their albums.If you listen closely to Paul's vocals you'll notice they sound kinda shot, ""ala '96"" style. Also, the drum sound is recent, check it out. And oh those added crowd noises!!! They sound SO fake it's disturbing.If you only want the four unreleased tracks, then borrow it from a friend. That'd be the smartest thing to do."
3,"Mostly rehash, some unheard songs, but skip the last track","This is a compilation of stuff from ""Alive"" and ""Alive II"", plus some previously unreleased stuff. But above all, skip the Interview track at the end. Kiss sat down with Jay Leno (why, I don't know) to record this interview, and most of what you will learn from it is that Leno loves the sound of his own voice and is less interested in holding an interview than in being the so-so stand-up comic he is. The band doesn't seem to be enjoying the interview either. What a waste of 15 minutes of disc space that could have been used for more music."
5,Blackhawk2009,"Hello Amazon Thanks you and This is the Greatest band on the planet YOU WANTED THE BEST YOU GOT THE BEST !!!! THE HOTTEST BAND IN THE WORLD ""KISS"" !!! Still Rocking after 40 years..."
2,Lacking in many ways,"Done in 1980 may explain the inadequate video and sound recording, a complete disservice to the fine choreography and highly professional dancing. The orchestra was another disappointing feature of this production with its timid use of percussion. Gayne is a passionate ballet and Khachaturian is a master of passion with his unique use of percussion throughout the entire ballet, even during the more tender dances. Only during the famous Saber Dance does the orchestra come to life, incidentally, this choreography of the Saber Dance has to be one of best ever performed."
2,CONFUSION,"THIS BALLET WHICH I HAVE IS NOT BY THE BOLSHOI BUT BY THE LATVIAN BALLET COMPANY CONDUCTED BY VILJUMANIS AT THE BOLSHOI THEATRE IN 1980. WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING WAS THE ORIGINAL VERSION CLIPS OF WHICH ARE AVAILABLE ON U-TUBE BUT NO COMPLETE PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL SEEMS TO BE IN PRINT. MAYBE ""HOOKHAM"" KNOWS DIFFERENT.STILL THIS IS BETTER THAN NOTHING BUT ISN'T ONE OF THOSE YOU LIKE TO WATCH OFTEN.WHEN IS THE BOLSHOI GOING TO RELEASE COPPELIA ON DVD?"
4,Fun toy.,My oldest (5 yr old boy) has had this for about a year already and it still gets 'found' and played with every so often. One of the magnifying pieces fell out of its housing at one point and I don't remember what I did when I fixed it but it hasn't come out again. It's a good toy and my son really likes the one that makes you see a lot of the same thing (beveled?). I'd buy again.
4,Starting it Off Right!,Jeff does a wonderful job in listing the rights and wrongs in starting a small group ministry. I have used this book as a guide to both adult and youth ministry. What a great way to start your creative insights to the world of small group ministry
3,OCR Copy needs re-work,My problem is not with H. Rider Haggard but the quality of the OCR copy. Notorious as OCR copying is and considering the book is only 122 pages the publisher could have spent a few hours with the original and cleaned up the mistakes made by the optical reader (which are numerous).
2,not substantial enough,"When I read Gourevitch's original article in The New Yorker on which the book is based, I was intrigued. It was in interesting story, well told. But the book seems padded and is occasionally boring (I skipped bits which I almost never do on principle). Worse, it doesn't seem that difficult or profound a case, and you start to question the original story. Really, not a lot happens, though there is a little insight into detection methods and the hoodlum milieu. Gourevitch is a good writer and journalist, but this shouldn't have been a book."
2,"Interesting, but not accurate","This was a present for my husband. We like it although, it is not quite accurate. We live in Arizona and it always reads about 5 degrees off. It never shows the Sun/cloud info correctly. And seldom is the barometric pressure in line correctly."
5,Great for Weather & Temperature,I love these things as they tell you the out side Temp and pressure. You can be your own weatherman.
2,Adequate product: Lousy service,"Owned for 10 months.Overall: Buy it if you are willing to treat it as a throw-a-way.Great when it works, fun and a good value BUT junk when it breaks. The ""Atomic Time"" feature has worked sporadically and worked for less than 2 months in the past 10 months. Other reviews suggest that this problem is typical of this and of other Oregon units.When it breaks: Oregon Scientific email support takes weeks to respond as noted in other reviews. Responses are less than helpful. Then, they make it as difficult as possible to get warranty service. For example, you must send them a copy of your orginal, clearly dated receipt before they will even respond to warranty inquiries. Then, after they verify the receipt, you go through an elaborate registration and approval process before you can return the product."
3,"Performs Basically as Advertised, Except ---","I have used this item for about a month now, and it seems to work well with one somewhat major exception. The mount for the satellite unit is similar to what you would expect on a picture frame, so it is way too flimsy for outdoor mounting where it might be exposed to wind, which is common here in metro Denver. So, we have it indoors, in another area of the house, where it performs well --- but, this makes the weather predictor and outdoor temp/humidity feature useless. When the weather improves, I may try to rig a sturdier mount for the satellite, and expect then it would work fully as advertised."
4,"Has its problems, but still a good device","I have had this unit for a few weeks now and have had a pretty decent experience. The temp and humidity seem accurate enough for my own personal use and the weather prediction is accurate more than 75% of the time.I did run into the same problem as one of the other users where it wouldn't take the information from the remote unit without it being right next to the base. I proceeded to change the remote and base unit to channel 2 and reset both devices (as I didn't feel like trying to figure out which one needed resetting) and it work immediately.For the price, this is well worth it."
2,Poor Predictor of Weather,"I bought this unit due to it's ability to tell me the weather changes. It is poor in this ability. If you have a sprinkler running within 100 feet of this unit, it will tell you it is going to rain...even in the middle of July in California when a heat wave is occurring. I would not recommend this product, especially if you are thinking it is going to tell you the predicted weather due to barometric pressure.If you want to know the temperature, time, date, this will do it, but you can purchase a much less expensive product to do that. The clincher with this weather unit, was to predict, or interpret the barometric pressure, not tell me I had my sprinklers on. Oh, and if it is foggy, it will tell you it is raining. Look elsewhere, don't waste you money on this one."
1,Doesn't Work - Poor Support,"I purchased the unit, new. From the start the outside temperature did not work, the display indicated that the temperature was out of range. Since the unit was indoors, it's hard to believe that 69 degress is out of range. Dealing with their support has been painfull. They will not support the product when you make the call. They put in a case, and say ""Someone will get back to you"" Well, I've put in three cases now, and no one has gotten back to me.Dealing with Oregon Scientific has been a miserable experience. This unit is a POS."
5,Almost perfect alarm clock,"Forget the weather features, this is a great alarm clock. Completely battery powered so no power outage issue. The atomic clock feature keeps perfect time. The snooze/indiglo button on top is very convenient. The alarm on/off button in the front is convenient, but not so much that you turn it off instead of snoozing it. Very smart alarm tones, changes throughout the course of a few minutes before giving up and then tries again after an auto snooze period. This makes sure you get up, but doesn't disturb the neighboring rooms for a whole day/week/month that you might be away and forgot to turn off the alarm. Very portable... I like knowing the temperature outside when I get up. The only thing that could be improved is the visibility in the dark. The indiglo works great, but only for a few seconds. This is good for battery life and if you like to sleep in darkness, but bad for seeing the time in the middle of the night."
1,"Month/day wrong starting Jan 1, 2008","A decent product but beginning Jan 1, 2008 the month/day began being reported as 00/30. It can be manually overridden but when it auto-synchs it returns to an invalid date."
3,Weather Forecaster with Clock,"I bought this item even after reading some of the reviews. There is some truths I discovered about this product and it's about the lack of instructions. The tempeture never reads the same according to the forecast and I had to try for more than a day to configure my time to the atomical clock in CO. Otherwise than that, this clock is pretty good for the price. Extra sensors costs more than the clock itself. That's a downfall."
3,Time and Temp,"This system is overall nice, except that the time will not go to CST. I have tried to manually set the time on it and within 24 hrs it reverts back to Mountain time. I have reset the sensor and the main unit to pick up the correct time, but it always goes back to one hr before what I originally set it at. Does anybody have an answer for this? I have read the manual and the website over and over, can't seem to find the problem. Also, temperature always seem to be off about 4 degrees from any other thermometer that I have in my house. I would think that if a couple of temps are correct in my house that this one should be close anyway. I do like the humidity reading and the forecast seems to be accurate."
4,My husband's favorite Christmas gift,"This was just what my husband wanted. :)It was very easy to set up and has a nice large, easy to read display.I just wish it always had the back light on... you have to press a bar on the top to turn the light on for about 7 seconds.Don't forget to purchase batteries, they weren't included. It takes 3 AA's for the unit and 2 AAA's for the sensor that goes outside, and the instructions say NOT to use rechargable batteries.Overall, it was a very good purchase. :)Linda Rogers[...]"
4,Value packed Unit,"Solid product works very well; I like the time feature thats connected the United States official time site, very accurate.The only area I would change is the numbers could be a little larger; minor."
2,"Good, but NOT accurate","I tested this thermometer against 7 others, 3 of them Oregon Scientifics. All 7 were within plus or minus one degree, but the BAR608HGA base unit was off by over 3. I emailed Oregon Scientific about recalibrating the unit, but was emailed back that there was no way to recalibrate and that the inaccuracy are acceptable to them. I just left it at that, even though they advertise accuracy within 2 degrees. In conclusion, I use it, but when I look at the base unit I just have to mentally add three degrees to the inside temperature."
3,Issues with Daylight Savings Time,"This weather station works well for reporting temperature, humidity, and pressure (which it reports both by direction and level, unlike most stations that just report pressure direction)However I live in Arizona, where we do NOT use Daylight Savings Time. Unfortunately this device always automatically sets Daylight Savings Time (as I understand it this is transmitted in the radio signal used to automatically set the time.) this means that twice a year I have to change the time zone that the device thinks that it is in. This could have been resolved, as many devices do, with a simple switch to allow people living in areas that have wised up and don't use DST to prevent the automatic time change."
4,"Puccini, Arias","This is truly a historical recording. Kiri Te Kanawa presents an outstanding performance as does Pavarotti. The two soloists together blend magically.The other two singing roles are slightly weaker, but the beauty of Puccini's orchestrations and the orchestra's performance of it help you forget the strained notes of the baritone. It leaves you wanting to here more of Luciano and Kiri Te."
2,Not Much Of A Deal,This really isn't much of a savings versus just getting it at the grocery store or Sam's Club. Plus the package was open when it arrived and it was a few short of the 24 advertised.
3,"Was okay, but I wouldn't buy it if I had seen it first.....","If you are purchasing this DVD and working on very young children, I think it is an okay investment. I was disappointed on the quality of the finished work. It seemed to be 'sloppy' or 'gloppy'....but I think it is partly due to my expectations. I wanted to invest in a DVD that offered up more detail and a more quality finished product."
3,Song of the Exile,"This novel is about an aspiring jazz musician from Hawaii who gets mixed up in the social injustices of the times, and war (WWII) along with his girlfriend. This book, also, depicts the horrors of the Japanese ""comfort women""."
3,Just Got It,"The UPS guy just brought my watch to me. I was really excited as I opened it, but honestly kind of let down that it was skinnier than I thought from the ads I see of it in magazines. This is the first gold tone watch I have owned, so that may be playing a factor in my initial shock. I think it will grow on me. The band is way to big. I guess I will take it to the jewelry store at the mall and see if they can take a couple of links out, or maybe there are instructions on that in the paperwork. Does anyone know?"
3,another swell flick,"This is another 3rd party movie from ei cinema. It has a good look to it, though it has some technical flaws. I very much liked the comentary that Mike Raso did, which as before was just a long apology for how this movie falls short of what he really wanted. I also too enjoyed that we got the dubbed version and the ""raw"" version with all the flaws to it so we could see how it was that they cleaned it up. As for the movie the gals in the production were very nice, the acting was adequate, the plot itself is acually very well thought out. The problem is in bringing this thought to the screen. Far be it from me to criticize a movie made for eye candy but the exposition just wasn't enough. Perhaps its the use of flashbacks to explain a story that irritates me, over all I would say I'd rather sacrifice a few minutes of the eye candy to get the plot moving. Also the fangs were laughable, even for this budgeted of a film."
3,Better Than Nowhere Man?,This book is okay but I had to laugh when I saw it was supposed to be better than Nowhere Man. What a way to set someone up for disappointment! Nowhere Man is the best Light Street book ever and this one isn't as good. It's too predictable. You know everything that's going to happen. I was kinda bored in spots. Then the action picked up. Still better than most.
2,Boring,I usually love Light Street books. I have read them all. This one was too similar to other ones. There was already an amnesia story a couple of books ago. Now here's another one. That makes three amnesia cases involving 43 Light Street. That sounds like an epidemic to me! Someone should check that out. It reads like every other amnesiac book of this kind I've ever read. Nothing new here. I'm guessing all these people who loved it so much didn't read those other books. If they really loved it. What's with all these people posting reviews from magazines? Don't they have opinions of their own? I didn't think The Man From Texas was anything special. Took me a week to finish. I kept finding other things to read.
5,A WHOLE BUNCHA MEMORIES,"This album sorted out sanity vs loud insanity in most instances comparing the old fashioned music and the mod mix of rap and rock of today's world. Music is a generational thing and I am an old timer that thrives on the mix of many wind and string instruments vs guitars, guitars and more guitars. Why they put ""Happy Birthday"" on this album is beyond me, but the rest of the cuts are pure enjoyment. It set me in the mood of pleasant song lyrics and arrangements so much that I am now buying more of the 30's and 40's bands that I either missed or forgot about.This gives me a moving music experience"
1,Ms,I am having blood pressure problems. I bought this monitor to check my pressure daily. It was grossly different (in a negative way) from the reading my doctor got when checking my pressure. The monitor gave me a false sense of accuracy whcih could have been life threatening for me.
2,convenient,convenient and works very smoothly but i can take 3 different blood pressures consecutively & get 3 decidedly different results which makes me question the accuracy of this unit.
4,blood pressure,Very good product for the price . I really like the large cuff it makes it easy to put on . The unit is very simple to assemble and operate . I would recommend this product .
5,Acurate monitor for the price,My dad had two monitors. This one is more acurate and consistent. This's the most important thing for a blood pressure monitor. The only problem is that it is not portable. But it is a good idea to have one in your office and one at home for such a cheap price.
1,blood pressure monitor,I do not remember purchasing this product. If I did I must not have liked it because I now use a wrist monitor.
4,Omron HEM-712CLC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with Large Cuff,"I already have an older model of the Omron and it is accurate for an over-the-counter blood pressure machine. I was in need of a bigger cuff machine and purchased the HEM-712CLC. It is a good machine and very accurate. I have only two concerns. I am a big guy but the cuff is huge! I could wrap it around my arm almost twice. I am concerned about the readings if the cuff is that large but there haven't been any inaccuracies because of it. Secondly there is the shape of the machine itself. I have to travel with it and it is an unnatural shape and larger than my old model which makes it difficult to pack for travel. Performance-wise, it was easy to use out of the box and the memory aspects of the machine are as easy to use as well. I am pleased with it overall."
3,OMRON automatic BP machine,"Purchased this to start routine home checking of my blood pressure. Cuff is too wide - but that is apparently an industry standard. Nice clear readout but machine has tendency to start inflating cuff and then show ""error"" message. No explanation for error code and sometimes it takes 2-3 tries to get it to take a reading. Otherwise a fine home monitor."
2,Unworkable,"We bought this ""large cuff"" blood pressure monitor for use by my wife who has heavy arms. It caused her too much pain upon use. We were unable to take her blood pressure with it. It seemed to work fine on me, but I didn't need the monitor."
1,Terrible,"It's just big enough to be difficult to pack when I travel. And it's terribly inaccurate. If you buy this, **BE SURE** to check it against your doctor's BP cuff. The Omron consistently shows my lower pressure 10-15 points HIGHER than my doctor's."
4,Good and Easy to Use,I have purchased the BP MOnitor 3 weeks back and so far I am happy with its performance. One issue what I have found with the product is that it makes a lot of noise when inflating the cuff. Othervise the readings look ok.
2,Validate your Warranty!!!!,"This monitor worked great for the first few years. When it stopped working I called the manufacturer and they told me it was probably the cuff. I bought a cuff and unit still doesn't work. I know nothing last forever but I've taken immaculate care of this unit. It was rarely even used, maybe I didn't use it enough??? I don't know, all I would advise is be sure to REGISTER YOUR PRODUCT WITH OMRON AND KEEP UP WITH THE WARRANTY INFO. Paying $60 for something that only works for 3-4 years is just a little frustrating for me personally but this is the brand that was recommended by my doctor."
5,blood pressure cuff,"This is the second one I bought, the 1st was mine and this one is going to my daughter. They are easy to use and I think it is pretty acurate."
3,good,"this monitor has tested out to be fairly accurate, not perfect, but good enough for home use. I would purchase again."
3,Must be positioned perfectly,Not easy to place the large cuff correctly without assistance. It will give an inaccurate reading (high) if the cuff is not positioned perfectly. Right arm cuff placement is different than left arm. Otherwise the monitor works as discribed.
4,IT'S OKAY,THE BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR IS BETTER THAN NOT HAVING ONE. I WAS HAVING QUITE A BIT OF TROUBLE WITH MY BLOOD PRESSURE AND WAS ADVISED TO BUY ONE. I FIND THAT I REALLY HAVE TO TAKE IT WITH ME TO THE DR. EVERY TIME I GO TO MAKE SURE IT IS ACCURATE. IT TENDS TO ADD 10 POINTS TO THE DISTOLIC.
4,Mostly pleased with monitor,"I bought this item because I'm a pretty big guy and needed a cuff that would fit me as well as my wife. My wife has suffered a stroke and needs to monitor her blood pressure twice a day. The monitor works very well when I use it, but my wife has trouble getting the cuff to fit and sometimes gets errors. The monitor is very fast, getting a reading within two minutes and I consider it very accurate."
5,Comfortable BP Measurement,I am slightly claustrophobic and dislike any sort of constriction like blood pressure cuffs. The Omron HEM-712CLC with large cuff was the most comfortable way to take my blood pressure I have experienced in the last 25 years. It automatically inflates to the perfect pressure and is very fast at giving you a measurement. Hypertension can be a serious condition if you don't take steps to measure and control it. I am now very comfortable with my BP measurement procedure.
2,Inaccurate as the 711,"I bought this because my arm is right on the edge of the size they say for the small cuff, being 13"". I have the 711, and it is very inaccurate, as much as a 40/20 change WITHOUT MOVING THE CUFF, so I though perhaps the larger cuff on the 712 would work better. Nope, it is just as inaccurate, so I have no idea of how one is supposed to get reliable readings of bp short of going to the doctors. I am not buying another Omron, no matter what.Best Regards,"
2,Omron Blood Pressure Machine,"The product is giving varied results each time you are checking your Blood Pressure. Also, the adaptor is not working, so I had to purchase a new one.Think twice before purchasing this product."
3,JJ,This is good to buy if you really want to just have a BP measure tool at home but if you really need it for personal use I would rate this 3 out 5The price should be better based on the feature and the product looks...Not bad and not good too... so so situation for this product...
2,omaron hem-712clc automatic blood pressure monitor,blood pressure monitor has 4 aa batteries and i have to put new batteries in unit every 2 weeks they go dead i have to check my blood pressure about every 3 days for the rest of my life a lot of batteries i'll have to use also i have to take it to my doctor's office and compare it with their monitor
4,Omoron Hem-712c with large cuff,"This is my first BP machine. It works well and is giving readings comparable to those I receive in my Dr.'s office. The product description mentions that the cuff is 9-13 inches but this LARGE cuff machine actually has a cuff that fits 13-17 inches according to the box. Fits my larger arm nicely. Just wanted to clarify this for all of you who are looking for large cuff machines and noticed that the product description gives the size of a regular cuff. Good machine, easy to set up and use."
1,At least it fit my arm...,"I needed a big cuff so I was excited about this product. I get it, put it on, turn it on and poof, my blood pressure is OUT OF CONTROL. I brought it to the Dr's office to have them test my blood pressure manually then with this machine. It was 30 points off, taken 3 different times on different days. I am not satisfied with this product, returning it as soon as I can and would discourage you from buying it. There are other big cuff products to purchase, pay a little more and get one that you can trust."
1,Useless,"This machine has consistenly registered my BP at much higher levels than my doctor's monitor. I was concerned that my blood pressure medicine was not working, as every reading I took was around 145/100. So, I took the Omron machine with me to my most recent doctor visit and had the doctor take her readings and then the Omron's readings. The doctor's readings were 130/85, in both arms, where the Omron was still showing 140ish/100. So, my doctor took readings from both arms again with her monitor, and still got 130/85. I haven't used the Omron since. It's junk."
5,Quality,"I love this thing...I'm hard of hearing, so I can't use a stethyscope.. This digital unit works well for me..I recommend it highly.."
4,Photographic History,"This was written a long time ago. While an f stop is still an fstop, unless you are into historic cameras and processes this book will not help you much. If you are interested in the how and why and the things that come before - you will enjoy this immensely. It is important to know how we got to where we are. If you are a serious photographer, with an interest in this (like me) you will find this a very good book. If you are just wanting to be able to take better photos at 5 fps it won't help."
1,Outdated,"This book is a ""how to"" for photographers about 100 years go. (maybe not quite that long, but it's close) It's great as a little history lesson; learning what it took to get photographs so long ago, but unless you are ready to pull out some VERRY old equipment, or do a report about it, I'd find a different History book to read."
5,I can't get enough of this CD !!,"Crime ROCK !! it's that simple , i'd go as far to say they were the best Rock n Roll band from the West-Coast of the States. Personal favourite songs - Piss On Your Dog and Murder By Guitar , these guys influenced bands from Sonic Youth to Guitar Wolf , they must have been amazing to see Live back in the early 1980's , if you love Dirty Rock n Roll you really need to own this , 10/10"
1,Did not like this movie,"I watched the VHS version purchased some years ago. I am a big Timothy Dalton fan but this is far from his best work. The scenes are disconnected and the sound quality is poor. The Irish accent gets in the way of understanding conversations, and therefore the plot. Having spent some time in Northern Ireland, I know the history of the IRA ""revolution"" but if not for the news stories of that time, the story would not be revealed very well."
5,Awesome Dance versions,All of these tracks have its own touch to make the same some unique...u are certainly dancing to each track.
5,more than expected,"I was extremely hesitant to order these counter stools. I had been researching and pricing counter stools and they were quite expensive for what I was looking for. When I found these, they looked good, sounded good and the price was right - could this be true? Usually not - you get what you pay for. But I ordered them and received them in excellent condition. They were easy to put together and the end result was a very pleasant surprise! I love the look and the quality. If I had the opportunity I would order the table and more counter stools without question!! Someday"
4,good value,"These chairs look very nice and they are comfortable too. I ordered four of these and one of them had a small crack on its back when the box was opened. I just didn't want a hassle to return it and get another, I just took it. Overall, I am happy with the chairs, though. The price is nice too."
5,One of the best kept secrets of pop/folk rock of the 90s,"Wood and Wire is a real treat for the ears. Chris Von Sneidern is one of the best kept secrets of modern pop music. This album, which is much better produced than his previous ""Sight and Sound,"" shows a true melodic genius reaching a wonderful stage of maturity. It brings a 90s flavor to the folk and pop rock of the late 1960s and early 70s. From the opening chords of ""Starting Out"" to the Dylanesque pathos of ""The End,"" this CD is full of hooks and lush harmonies. Instrumentation varies from simple guitar to more complex arrangements using everything from horns to harpsichord. If you have any attraction at all to power pop, you will find this to be one treasure that you will play again and again. Truly one of the outstanding pop recordings of the late 1990s."
3,I wonder where these were made?,"It's hard to find a 60 degree v-bit and these came highly recommended. Although I would question if they were made in china because the quality was horrible. On my v-bit there were machining burs on all the cutting edges near the top. I had to remove them myself, if I hadn't it would have surely ruined any project I would have tried to create."
5,Great!,"Needed the book for class asap, luckily the book came in very soon! It has some writing in it but I don't mind, if anything the notes on it helped me study more and think about certain passages!!"
3,It's okay.,"If you want to know how George Orwell and Aldous Huxley were influenced, it's a good read. However the pacing is off, the format is difficult to follow and the plot is underwhelming. The main character is not really indentifiable or likeable in any way.For serious dystopian fans, only."
3,Orwell's original source of inspiration for 1984,"If you read 1984, then I recommend this book. 1984 was a diluted version of this extremely survailanced society, where everything you do is synchronized with the rest of the populace. A world where the word privacy is not even in the dictionary. Yevgeny was a Russian Rocket Engeneer, and his character is a reflection of this. It has been a long time since I have read this, so I might not be so acurate, but it is worth checking into."
5,Lyrical Precursor to Orwell,"While this is the book that inspired Orwell's 1984, the focus of We is much more artistic than 1984. While 1984 is an overwhelmingly political dystopian novel, We emphasizes the artistic loss in an authoritative state. We is indespensible, even beside Orwell, because We is much more an epic poem, a beautiful piece of prose and lyricism, than merely an argument against the restraint of freedom for 'one's good.'"
4,The precursor to other famous dystopias,"WE was the prototype for both Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD and you can see the elements of both contained in this novel. Given the fairly obvious allusions to Communist Russia it is no surprise that the novel was suppressed for so long. The representation of people by numbers (the central character is D-503), and the conditioning of people to accept the denial of their individuality, are still things which raise alarms in various parts of the world today. The novel is complex in that there are some aspects of this society of which Zamyatin seems to approve. Our initial impressions would normally be that his presentation is focussed upon negatives. In this translation the novel is not too difficult to read. It is a good challenge to all of us to think about how our own societies (and the parts of them that we have some influence upon ie: our families etc.) are ordered."
5,A Dystopian Classic,"This precursor to George Orwell's 1984 is undoubtedly one of the finest works of science fiction produced to date. If you're a fan of dystopian SF, or have even only read 1984 and/or Huxley's Brave New World, the basic elements of the story will be familiar to you. This book is as good, if not better than those two works, which is high praise indeed. Zamyatin's writing style is breathtaking (though how much of it can be attributed to translator Brown I'm not sure - I haven't read Ginsburg's translation).If you enjoy dystopian SF, be sure to read this amazing book."
3,Strange...,"I found this story very strange and uncomfortable... depressing even. However, the work does provoke thought and inspires an appreciation for freedom, personal independence, and privacy."
2,Not what is listed,"Dissapointed with product . Product actual size was 4.5 Height x 11.5 circumference x 3.5 diameter all in inches not what is listed, i.e 6 x 13 x 4 ."
4,Rivers War,"Enjoyed the book. Eric Flint gives us an intresting outlook of the battle of New Orleans. He uses many famous characters like Sam Huston, Presidents Madison and Monroe and the firey General himself Andy Jackson. This book is a fun read for alternate history buffs."
3,Getting Better,"Here's what everyone should know about every Eric Flint book ever written: He gets a really good idea, and slowly wears you down the more you read. He adds point-of-view characters the same way a labrador gets ticks in May. He meanders like nobody's business. He uses more anecdotes than a Baptist preacher. He has so many projects started he'll never finish them all. Please understand I enjoy reading his novels because the ideas are great but he writes in such a roundabout fashion that I skip whole paragraphs and pages. That said, ""Rivers"" is the best book I have ever read by him. It's a good crisp, read. He's either learned a few new tricks or has a better editor."
2,Flawed Alternate History,"To qualify as an alternate history, there must be a critical point which results in a completely different future. The problem that I had with this book is that the point chosen to diverge from actual historical events is so inconsequential that, other than a few battles which only a historian would be acquainted with, the reader is hard pressed to know or care about the alternate outcome.In addition, this book lacks the scope or vision which one usually expects from this type of work. It reads like a college history book peopled with a few characterizations of the people of the time. From a historical perspective, the only really interesting character is a minor player compared to the other historical personalities which are mentioned.Finally, this work appears to be only the first of several, designed to drag the reader through a tedious serialization which only a scholar, intimate with the minute details of Native American history could appreciate."
4,A Good Start for a Promising Story,"Rivers of War suffers just a little from being a preliminary for what will likely be the main story in the second book. Nevertheless, it stands up pretty much on its own. The premise is that Sam Houston is only slightly wounded in a battle during the War of 1812 (in real history he was laid up for the rest of the war.) That starts a whole series of events that brings not only Sam Houston, but some of his Cherokee relations to the Battles of Washington and New Orleons and what promises to be a far kinder (and more exciting) fate for the Cherokee nations years later, which doubtless will be related in the second book. I'm looking forward to it.(...)"
1,Alternate History or Bad History book,"Well, I like the Alternate History genre, but this book reads like a bad History book - The Cherokee people call themselves this, and Cherokee is a white man's word, and blah-blah-Zzz - this novel spends so much time explaining the characters, which if you did not take American history EVER you would need, however, I did go to school and I know who these people are - quite honestly, I know that the other series is supposed to be better, but I will not be spending any of my future book shopping time going out of my way to find the 1632 series - eventually I will, but first, I must finish my Eric Flint induced Coma-nap inspired by - Zzz......."
5,"Modernization, Globalization, and Confucianism in Chinese Societies",A well written book. The author gives an accurate picture of what is going on in Chinese Societies which give a better understanding to the latest social developments that may be occuring in these socities as well as with the diaspora Chinese in Western countries.
5,The Way Punk Ought To be,"The suicide commandos make a record"" is a fine example of the heart and soul of punk- if indeed punk has a soul- it is adrenniline on vynil and it doesn't reek of clinical depression the way its decendants tend to....the lyrics have a sense of humour without being precious or precoucious...it's a gem of an album guaranteed to remind you why the slam pit graces the earth."
5,Intro to Mere Christianity.,"C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors, he is witty and clear, and when he explains a point, if you don't understand it, you probably never willl.In the case for Christianity, Lewis draws out the argument for Christianity, begining with the Law of nature, and step by step drawing the reader to the existence of God, the necessity of Salvation, and Christ's salvific work in the world. The book itself is out of print, but if you want to read it, don't despair. It's the first part of Lewis' larger work, Mere Christianity."
4,One of Bennett's very best pop-oriented albums,"Although he includes pop songs like ""Something"" and ""Everybody's Talkin'"", Bennett sings them in his darkly jazz-influenced style which wrings new meaning out of the lyrics; and the orchestrations, in tune with Tony's wry penchant for offbeat, jazzy inflections, keeps things in perspective. This isn't the light, airy outing you may expect: songs like ""Coco"" and ""Wave"" are imbued with a melancholia that isn't exactly reassuring, but is still strangely blissful(in a low-key fashion). It's quite a remarkable mood piece, actually, and the 4 1/2 minute ""Make It Easy On Yourself"" is heartbreakingly sung. I was only disappointed in this early version of ""What a Wonderful World"", which seems an after-thought. B+"
3,Adultery & Greed At the Forefront,This is right in line with most of Wilbur Smith's books. The development of Africa on the backs of the impoverished blacks. A theme throughout all of his books is the coexistence of these diverse groups and the mutually beneficial relationships that can and do exist between them.This book falls about in the middle of his tales of Africa. I liked the earlier books on the development of gold mining in Africa better but once you are hooked on Wilbur Smith you have to continue until all are read.
5,Wilbur Smith is a great author,"One of his book, ""Eagle In The Sky"" was the best book ever. ""Gold Mine"" is also a good book. And ""Train rom Katanga"" AKA ""Dark Of The Sun"" saved my life in Viet Nam"
3,Short Story,I've read many of Wilbur Smith's novels and enjoyed them tremendously. This book falls into the category of a short story for the author. It was entertaining but didn't have the depth of detail that his longer books have. I got the feeling that this could have been a longer novel cut short for some reason.
3,Gold Mine,Gold Mine Good book as you would expect from Wilbur Smith but not one of his best.But am looking forward to new releases.
4,Worth the $$,"I purchased this set probably 5 years ago, I am very satisfied due to the price of the set. I do have scratches and dings on it but would buy them again no question. Now, if you are looking for high quality this is not the set for you, however, they are very sturdy, attractive, and you can't beat the price. We use our coffee table as if it were a dining room table, put our feet on the bottom shelf all of the time and it has held up like a champ."
2,wouldnt buy it again,"For the money I paid I expected something a little better. The style is nice, the color is dark. It's not wood. The overlay is peeling off in all parts of the set. I tried to clean it n it just leaves smudge marks all over. I guess u get what u paid for. Easy to assemble but quality sucks!!! Wouldn't ever purchase again."
3,Could've been better,The tables are nice but i received them and they are all banged to hell. Wont be ordering anymore furniture from this site.
1,CHEAP!!!!,"Do not pay attention to the regular price of $999. This set is exactly the value of what you pay for $200.Also furniture arrived with several nicks and scratches, if i din't have to swallow the return shipping, i would've sent this back.buyer beware.BTW this is my first bad review i've given for an amazon purchase!!"
1,Terrible!!,"Oh dear!! The sound quality of this DVD is very poor and the presenter has an unusual accent so it is virtually impossible to understand what is being said. Save your money, there are a lot better treadmill workouts out there...tryTotal Body Sports Conditioning: Treadmoves- very good and as challenging as you want to make it. Never has 40 minutes gone by so quickly!"
2,Oh Dear...,"Yes this DVD has some new moves that you can use, but man it is incredibly boring. Sound, picture, cut, music, light, presentation etc. It leaves a lot to be wanted. It is NOT worth your money."
2,"Surprisingly small, too poofy to be useful.","I ordered this to be shipped to grandma's house for a recent visit, when our 4-y-o wouldn't have a bed. She'd gotten him a sleeping bag, and we thought this would be good padding below it on the floor so he'd be comfortable.It turned out that when inflated, this was actually too small to be comfortable for him to sleep on, signficiantly smaller than the sleeping bag, and so ""poofy"" once it plumps up that he would have just rolled off of it. Because it didn't meet our needs, I returned it.It was, however, apparently well constructed, had a valve that operated easily to allow you to roll it up / roll the air out of it and keep it compressed, and when compressed took up a very small amount of storage. Came with a patch kit and a set of velcro straps that hold it rolled up and provide a handle. If it had been just a bit bigger, and maybe had a few more ""quilting"" points to keep it from being so pillowy, it would have been perfect."
5,It is so cute!,"This combines my 4 year old son's two favorite things baseball and Spider-man! He was thrilled and has me read this to him all of the time and he has not asked me to read to him this much in a while! There is a whole series that goes with this and I hope to be able to get all of them! There is a basketball, soccerball and a football one!I was so shocked to find anything sports related with Spider-man! What a great find!"
2,Uninspired,"With my interest whetted by the recent Encores presentation of Pipe Dream, I got this from the library, along with the OBC recording of Pipe Dream. There's only about a half hour of music on the Me and Juliet CD and frankly, it's terribly uninspired.I understand why this musical, a Kiss Me, Kate wannabe, was a flop, although it's not mentioned as one in Ken Mandelbaum's brilliant book, Not Since Carrie!Pipe Dream may have been the bigger flop, but the OBC recording is livelier and far more enjoyable than this. Does this one need to have the book fixed and a revival staged? Unless Encores deems it worthy, I suspect it won't see the footlights ever again. While the new libretto for Kiss Me, Kate is ghastly, at least it's getting produced on occasion.I would much rather see a production of the grittier Pipe Dream, which is a much more interesting show than this thing!"
4,GREAT CONCERT / LAME EXTRAS,"the concert looks great, besides the fact that they dubbed the sound. it has some studio enhancment on it. but its still a great show. and the DOCUMENTRY sucked nothing interesting hapens, just them acting stupid and blowing up basketballs.plus WHAT THE HELL IS BAM MARGEREA doin in there????"
2,Ultra-Lame extras..oh and the concert plain lame,"I'd like to agree with most of the reviews here presented, since the extras really sucked, te setlist was awful...many new songs and as heavy-left handed they failed to play perfectly on many songs i don't know if it was because they were drunk, or the change band members constantly but I wouldn't really expect from a band that old to play out of tempo. oh..and no nipples or whatsoever..at least not like it used to be!"
4,"simple story, boy meets girl...","Boy meets the girl of his dreams at a party, stupidly misses a date(heh, you'll see...) the day after, and spends most of the rest of the book pursuing her. Along the way, he encounters more crazy stuff than you can shake a stick at. Damn funny in the English translation, I can't imagine how it must be in the original (Dutch?). A delightful used bookstore surprise, this really needs a re-release."
2,i don't get the twist,"I don't get the 'twisted' part of these, all i saw was a thicker end that was shaped a little funny, more like some kind of manufacturing error, plain condoms feel better than these do-they don't have a thick end to dull sensations, I'd rather get the 'pleasure mesh' or 'her pleasure' by trojan, those you can actually see and really feel the textureThis review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com"
4,Great Gift for Dad by Dad,"Just got this 50"" Panny on Father's Day. It was a terrific Father's Day gift to myself. I was torn between this 1080i plasma and the new 1080p, but the new models cost twice as much and there is no 1080p programming, unless you have a blue ray or HD dvd player. Some say go with 1080p to future proof your tv. However, since the major network just spent millions buying 720p/1080i cameras, I'm doubtful 1080p will appear soon. I'm in the process of ordering HD cable, so I can't attest to the quality of the HD picture yet. However, SD and dvd are great so HD should be too. It does reflect unwanted images in bright light, but this isn't a problem for me because I usually watch tv when it's dark. (That's why it gets 4 stars.) For the price, it's hard to go wrong with this tv."
5,After exhaustive study...Panasonic TH-50PX600U wins handsdown,"Clearest and brightest high-def image of all the plasma sets available. Discovery HD is awesome on this set. If you are in the market for a 50"" plasma TV, and you are not looking at Panansonic, then you are probably making a mistake."
5,Satisfaction out of the box.,"From order to delivery was 5 days. They took it off truck, placed it in Living Room , deboxed it and left. Husband and I hooked up wiring along with base and have been happy since.Soon We will get HD from Directv and they say it will be even better. Right now We are extremely satisfied with our purchase. The sound is great and watching our trip pictures on a 50' TV is awesome."
1,Do not waste your money.,I bought a package of 6 fish vegi clip and as soon as I opened the bag and took one of the clowns clips out the spring broke and after 4 of breaking I gave up on them. I will never buy this product again.
5,Good Sippy Cups...,"These sippy cuos are of a few that actually are No-Spill. The only thing is that you have to make sure that the no-spill valve is secure in the lid, because if that comes out then they do leak. I've had a bunch of these cups (Dora, Spongebob, Diego, Backyardigans) and they all have worn very well, the non-spill valves still stay in the lid and the designs are still in good condition. They are also insulated and definitely do keep their drinks either warm or cold longer than a normal cup."
4,BPA FREE!!!!!,"I'm not going to lie, these do occasionally leak, mostly when overfilled or when the top isn't properly screwed on, but that said they are still great cups, and one of the only affordable and BPA Free sippy cup options I have found. BPA Free is much more important to me than a few leaks, and I would totally recommend this to anyone."
1,These um....SUCK,We bought these for our son and it was spill proof the first time he used it and after that the part of the inside (makes it spill proof) wont stay on. you pay $8 for 2 cups and they dont even last a day. Were not made of money throw away on their crappy product
1,don't fall for the cartoons on the cup!,"I don't have the sippy cup version, but I have the ones w/the straws attached. These LEAK too, so don't buy those either. Plus, the rubber straws get moldy and are hard to clean. So far, all my Munchkin brand items are horrible! I'm looking for new cups tomorrow that don't have the bisephenol risk either."
3,Leaks too much,"I bought the Munchkin Dora 2 packs and my 1 year old loves the images and easily can drink from them, but they leak too much. Also, the stopper inside comes out easily and you only realize it once the water is allover the floor and you baby is crying because she slipped in the water. The images also fade very quickly. I bought them because they were similar to drinking from a regular cup and now need to research what other cups I can buy."
2,Cups Leak,"We own 4 of these cups, of which 3 of them leak from under the lid. We own plenty of other cups that don't have anywhere near the issues these seem to have. I would stay away."
4,Great cup!,"My son has been using this cup for 2 years with no issues. The only time it leaks is if you overfill it or don't screw the top on correctly. The only downfall is that the image wears off of the cup too quickly from handling, washing and general kid bashing. Its a great cup though."
5,Fritz makes history come alive!,"Jean Fritz makes history intersting for all ages. She has an uncanny way of seeing a historical figure as a real person with a well-rounded life that encapsulates more than just what he or she did in public. The life of her subject is of more importance than dates and events. Somehow this shift of emphasis makes the dates more memorable. She tells her story fresh, not told in the typical detached fashion. Her research and enthusiasm for her subjects make the stories come alive in interesting ways for today's student reader and interested adult."
1,Laughable.,"If you're curious as to the writing ability of this ""author"", read the 5 star reviews. Clearly, they were all fabricated by her. Three of the four contain wonderful! in the title, 2 of them are from A Customer (that originality is reflected in the poetry) and the other two are from women both, coincidently, named ann. Each of them talk about how modern it is (if by modern you mean uninspired, mundane and poorly written, then yes it is very modern.). Seriously, what kind of author makes fake accounts to rate their own work? If the author doesn't think their work is good enough to gain 5 star reviews on its own, then why would anyone else. Use the look inside feature before you buy to view samples of the poems this book contains. The quality of poetry found within can be compared to that of a child. Seriously, expand your vocabulary, invest in a thesaurus and don't review your own work."
5,WONDERFUL!,"insightful,knowledgeable, informative. reaches into the deep seed of the soul and touches the spirit!"
5,Weathertech floor mat,It fit like a glove and what I expected since this is my second one. I would definately recommend to anyone.
5,OMRON Blood Pressure Printer.,This item was purchased by me for my mother. She uses it regularly. I plan to make this a purchase for me personally the next time I am in need of a new OMRON blood pressure machine.
5,There is none better than HEM-705-CP Blood Pressure Monitor,"This particular Blood Pressure Monitor with Print-out, hasbeen used by my sister for 3 years with excellent results.Our doctor has been happy,too!MANY THANKS, EMRON!!U R THE BEST!!"
1,Can't buy,"My Husband needs to track his bp and Chol as we are well over 40+. He is having a mid-life whatever and is back into ""body building again"" but his bp is high normal. I cannot find a cuff to fit his 20"" relaxed upper arm. This one is a max of 13"". Hello?!?! Men are bigger and biceps are larger than women! Make something for the men. Useless to me did not order for my husband. I have been looking and did a search and this is the best of a google search? I have to go back to the med stores for this and look for one. Men's arms are LARGER with more muscle mass, Hello? Just thought I could save a few $$$$. Note the other great reviews were for women, not men!!!"
4,Grace,Good book about the grace of God and salvation to everyone that believes in Christ Jesus.We need to believe in the forgiveness of our sins. God gives us a new heart and a right Spirit through salvation.Recommend to those that want to understand what salvation is all about.
5,Prince of Preachers,"No one has ever matched Charles H. Spurgeon with the grasp of the English language. This great English preacher will never be matched for taking that which is profound and making it simple. He had the ability to take the most valuable of concepts and put tem on the low shelf where from the most simple to the most intellectual, all could bring something with them that would satisfy a need."
5,Excellent service!,"Very timely delivery, the product was new and in original package...and its a wonderful book that focuses our faith back where it should be; on grace. Spurgeon obliterates the works mind set in this timeless classic. Check it out! Great listen for car or office while working."
5,Greatest Witnessing Tool,"There are three great strengths of this book; 1)the ability to make the gospel so clear that even a child can understand, 2)it is written in modern english, and 3)the chapters are very short and to the point. Asking someone to read this is one of the easiest ways to introduce the subject of Christ. The book provides a basis of discussion and followup that many can not deny."
5,Classic for All Time!,"As with all works done by Spurgeon, this is a timeless classic. First printing in 1894, it is still in print. Simple yet profoundly true, Spurgeon explains the true Grace of God with a heart desire that many will come to know Christ through this work. I actually bought a whole case of 120 of these in paperback to give away from Moody Press. The audio version is awesome. I loaded it onto my iPod to listen while on the go."
1,People with problems - Mostly sad soap with few highlights,"Often on the twisted and abusive side with few revealing sexual scenes, but cute well figured girls - Plots bland and mostly disconnected with being a airline stewardess."
4,Great Child's Book,"This book was very fun to read; light-hearted and easy reading. I think this book would make a great bedtime story book, because each chapter is short and tells a very cute story from the memory of the grandma. She is a great storyteller. I definitely recommend this book to parents of children who like to be read to."
4,Buddy lackey or Devin Graves?,"The strange mind of Buddy Lackey, I truly believe if you are a fan of an artist you can apreciate all of their musings, for fans of PSYCHOTIC WALTZ and DEAD SOUL TRIBE, this is a must have! this material came about from a label that gave Buddy/Devin a solo contract,this material is pure Devin Graves, although not the same genre as progressive metal, this is a lyrical masterpiece, showing everyone that he can play anything and sing anything, and wearing his influences on his sleeves."
2,Bad Quality,"Looks nice when it comes, but after a couple weeks, it gets all scratched up and it no longer even keeps time. Very bad quality."
4,Thanks for the Mammogram,"This is a wonderful book for newly diagnosed breast cancer victims. Humorous, yet honest and open. I have met Laura Jensen Walker and she is a delight. I am 11 years a survivor and this was the first book I read after I was diagnosed. It helped me a lot and now I give it to newly diagnosed women."
4,The Hits Just Keep On Coming!,"P.J. Tracy has put forth another solid effort with Snow Blind. When two policemen are found housed in Snowmen, Minneapolis PD detectives Magozzi and Rolseth are called in to investigate. When another body is found in a Snowman they begin to think serial killer. With the help of the Monkeewrench crew and a rookie sheriff, they uncover a conspiracy that goes back 50 years. Interesting characters and an escalating plot."
5,Mom and Daughter do it again!,"I just finished Snow Blind and it was another great book by this mother and daughter team. If you have never read any of the Monkeewrench novels, it is okay to start with this one, because there is not as much monkeewrench in here as the others, and the background on them is not necessary to really enjoy this novel. However, if you have not read them, you must do so at once, this series is a great series.Which brings us to Snowblind. A great story, great ending, perfect atmosphere, I needed a blanket even in this heat of August....I look forward to the next novel of P.J. Tracy, they can't come fast enough."
5,Snow Blind,"This was the first book I have read by this author and was so impressed that I purchased all of her books.Snow Blind catches your attention immediately and you can't put this book down. As an avid mystery reader,I can hardly wait to start her next book."
4,Horrifying Premise!!,"Originally, this book actually is the one that brought this series to my attention. And I must say, the startling premise feels even more shocking within the story - I can't imagine a corpse being hidden inside something as sweetly innocent as a snowman! The mystery unravels in a very interesting and thrilling manner, but unfortunately the book ends with some rather serious loose ends. Like in Live Bait, the authors leave readers with a moral dilemma clouding their sense of justice, complicating the novel beyond that of your typical thriller. I do hope that the next book in the series brings a little bit more of a resolution, though - the loose ending spoils the intriguing premise just a bit for me."
5,Monkeewrench Crew,Loved the book. A really great read! I know if the characters were real that we would be great friends. I didn't have the plot figured out till the very end.
4,Good introduction to the topic,"Alland's book is a good introduction to the topic of race and IQ. He goes over the history of the associations and gives numerous examples and case studies. He gives a very clear description of the nuanced meaning of heritability which is at the crux of the debate. The book is academic, but not overly dense. Worth reading."
3,M'eh,"As a reader of more scientific texts than I'd like to admit, this book is dry by comparison. It is no more than a curiousity and a poorly done one at that. The author may have been trying too hard to make it sound factual. It does get points for the subject matter and taking it on as a scientific subject. The best part of the book is the ending in which a 'diary' is shown of a student of the dragons."
2,Predictable,"This book is not one of my favorites. Stallsworth did not balance such intricate and complex characters, I did not feel like I got to know each character until about the sixth chapter! Stallsworth did not bring the characters alive, in my opinion. It takes a true writer to bring that across, I can see that potential in her writing. Basically, her use of words and phrases were not detailed enough. I was disappointed because I looked forward to reading this short novel. Also, it was obvious, Stallsworth tried to take a vastly different approach towards the end the story remained predictable. Her twists and turns were not polished. Towards the end I did feel the pain and suffering of Mary, but it was not long lasting. I thoroughly did not enjoy this book but I will read the sequel because all writers deserve a second chance. I can't base my opinion on one novel. Hopefully, I was not too harsh."
3,Character Surprise,"I had the pleasure of Meeting Linda at a book signing of another African American female author and began reading the book right away. The storyline caught my attention and peaked my interest. Very interesting reading for a first novel.The main character, Mary Ann Mantle seemed to have varying behavioral and emotional attitudes. In the very beginning she is young and innocent, but within the first chapter she changes to curious, naive and freaky. This attitude continues throughout the book, but by the end she became angry and vindictive.Though I found these changes disturbing, I believe the author is an interesting story teller and has lots of potential for improving with future works.One word of advice is to improve the grammar, especially with tenses.This review is meant to be constructive criticism and not meant to discourage potential readers. I am looking forward to reading the sequel and recommend this novel."
2,"Very comfortable, bad zipper construction","I bought a pair of these for use as a firefigter/EMT under a year ago, and had the zipper on one boot fail during duty. I have the 6"" version of these as well, and both zippers are starting to tear away from the uppers. Very comfortable, lightweight boots, but the zippers are terrible! If you don't need quick on/off, buy the non zippered version of these, and you will probably be fine."
3,Missing pieces,"I got this puzzle as a gift for my mother. It is a beautiful puzzle, and she enjoyed it, but unfortunately, it was missing several pieces. This isn't the first time this happened. What ever happened to quality control? Is is too much to ask that a puzzle be complete?"
2,"Missing pieces, never finished","I purchased this puzzle for my husband and I to put together while I was pregnant with our first child. I was very tired and often ill, and there wasn't a whole lot I could get done before I needed to lay down for a while. This was the second puzzle we bought and we were pretty proud of our teamwork, so we expected this one to go smoothly. However, after we had gone through and located all of the outside pieces (double- and triple-checking) we realized that the puzzle was missing several pieces. I looked into it, and the manufacturer said they will send out a new puzzle if you mail them the proof of purchase, but they can't promise that it will have all the pieces either. What?! In the end I decided not to mail them proof of purchase and plead my case and we just tossed the puzzle out. It was a waste of money, but honestly, I shouldn't HAVE to ask for a new puzzle. They should have included all of the pieces with the first one I bought...."
3,"Fascinating, but unevenly presented","Sudden Fury never received the praise it deserved and it is probably out of print, but it's still a good read overall, and quite a heartbreaking true crime story. Leslie handles the investigative aspects of the case well, and presents a clear picture. There's no suspense here, of course, but it's such a well known story. I reread this recently, and was surprised to find I found it quite engaging."
1,"A rip-off, so look for other DVD releases of this movie!","Don't buy this piece of garbage. Godzilla fans have been subjected to sub-par VHS and DVD releases for years, and this is just the latest in a long list. Purchase ""Godzilla vs Hedorah"" from Sony/Tristar for the best DVD release of this film. Languages are the original Japanese w/ subtitles and the Toho International English dub. To get the AIP English dub, which was the version released to American theaters years ago, find a copy of the Smog Monster/Megalon Double Feature cheapie DVD on eBay. It's full screen and vastly inferior to the 'Hedorah' DVD, but you get the original AIP dub."
1,Bootleg!!,This is a cheap bootleg. Do not even waste your time looking at anything beyond this review. Why is this even on Amazon?
1,Amazon's standards are going down the toilet,They list this bootleg but don't list the legitimate Sony Tristar release of Godzilla Vs The Sea Monster. Who's getting paid off!
5,Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster,"What can I say...if you love Godzilla, and collect the movies you have to have this. My sons are such people, and this is one of the Christmas gifts for them. They'll love it!"
5,I fell in love at first listen.,"My sister introduced me to the wonderful sound of William Topley last year when I was looking for something different from the radio friendly garbage that is out there. From the first word out of his mouth I was completely and utterly hooked! I can't get enough of his beautiful voice, captivating lyrics and amazing soul. ""Black River"" is probably my favorite William Topley cd but that's only because it's the one I acquired first. ""Sink Like A Stone"", ""Drink Called Love"", ""The Ring"" ""Black River"" and ""I Don't Wanna Go Uptown"" are stand out songs for me but there really isn't a single bad song in this collection.If you haven't tried William Topley yet, don't miss out on this great performer. If you've tried this cd and want to expand your collection, all of the William Topley cd's are worth purchasing. He doesn't do bad music. Ever."
2,will not properly handle ATSC Digital Channels over CTV,"Unlike most other new TVs with ATSC tuners, this unit will NOT properly tune the free Digital HD or SD channels that are included by many cable tv providers now.The documentation leads one to beleive it will work properly. A call to their support line confirmed it will NOT."
2,Poor Sound,"The picture on this unit is passable, but the sound is limited. It will change volume randomly and even at full volume it is hard to hear. The remote control works but it often requires several tries to get the command to take."
1,Not worth buying! Take your money elsewhere!!,When my boyfriend moved in he brought this t.v. with him. It is not worth it. Right when we turn it on you have to do the settings button then hit the input button to get to cable. EVERY single time we turn it on. It sucks. THERE IS NO WAY TO PROGRAM IT TO OUR CAGLE BOX REMOTE. No code for Sylvania televisions would work. The cable guy tech could not even get it to be programed. Take your money elsewhere you can find a better tv at a better price that will work better
1,Do not trust the durability,"I do not have this particular model but have own TWO 14"" Sylvania LCD TVs and you need to be warned. After three years of use, both within a matter of three months (!), had their transformers go out. This means their power and the ability to stay on is gone. These TVs I believe are made for Sylvania by Funai and they are garbage. I paid $300 for each of these TVs and now neither works. That is horrible durability and value for the money. And repairing them is no easy or inexpensive task: at least $200 for each with no guarantee of future durability. Maybe we should just go back to the tried and proven tube technology. Stay away from these."
1,Beach ball contains TOXIC Taiwan Material!!! Do not give to children.,"I was shocked that after my husband blew this up, a sticker stating that it contained a materials that causes cancer and reproductive issues became visible. We were going to let my 1-year old play with it but threw it away immediately. I know it was made in Taiwan, but really, a beach ball that children will play with? Waste of money and scary to think of the material decomposing in the sun. DO NOT GIVE THIS TO YOUR CHILDREN. Are there any regulations? There are many inflatable objects that don't contain this type of carcinogen. Would have appreciated knowing this so I didn't purchase. Too much of a hassle to return. Wonder what my husband ingested blowing it up. Buy at your own risk but please don't expose your children to it."
3,half of the cicumference is not the diameter,"The ball is just what you expect for a beach ball and my 13 month old loves it so I don't really have a problem. However it's a little annoying that I was expecting a larger ball. Either they sent the wrong one or they forgot their grade school geometry. It does indeed measure 24"" going halfway around the circumference, but if it actually had a 24"" diameter it would be about 10"" larger end to end. Not really worth getting upset over, but it is not quite what I expected."
4,Another Barbie Movie,"My 4 year old grand daughter is just thrilled to get this movie. She has already watched it at least a dozen times. I think it was worth every penny. The shipper was great, no problems at all."
4,Barbie is so much better than when I was a kid,"I've never been a big Barbie fan, and was a little disappointed when my 5 year old became one. However, after watching this movie with her, I'm impressed.Although still way too skinny for my taste, Barbie is a bright, strong, brave female character and - dare I say - a good role model?The movie itself is cute. I could blow holes in the plot line, but it's a kids fantasy and a great story. I highly recommend it."
3,Trouble with the 3-D,"Does anyone else have trouble with the 3-D just looking bleery? I've seen a few things with 3-D and I remember the effect being a little sharper and more dimentional.Other than that the movie is GREAT! This is our first Barbie movie but now there will be lots more owned in our home, for sure! Do we ever really grow out of Barbie?????"
2,Worst of the Barbie movies,"This is definitely the worst of the Barbie series. I was leery at first about any of them, but the first three (Nutcracker, Swan Lake and Rapunzel) were good. A bit sugary but nothing offensive in them. This one however ... The heroine sneaks out and deliberately disobeys her parents on several occasions, yells at them disrepectfully and is generally smartmouthed. The hero (Aidan) is just as bad. Even the animated looks they give sometimes, turns my stomach as a mom. I wouldn't recommend this movie to little girls ... especially if they like to repeat what they hear! Screen it first."
4,"Wonderful movie, terrible 3-D!!","As far as the acting is concerned, this is a terrific Barbie movie, one of the better ones by far, but the 3-D effects leave much to be desired. I was very disappointed when we donned our glasses, only to have a very blurry visual with terrible discoloration. Moreover, the glasses were far from comfortable, but then again, they were probably made for much smaller faces!Nevertheless, I loved the storyline -- a beautiful princess who is not only courageous, but never gives up hope in her quest to save her parents and her kingdom from certain destruction. To succeed she must secure three rare objects (not tangible) within 36 hours. Hope"" is the central theme in this movie -- that one should never give up on it, and should always expect succeed with even the ""teeniest"" amount of it no matter what circumstances come their way. It's a very positive message for young (and perhaps not so young) audiences.Cris Cunningham for Amazon.com"
4,Much better than Barbie in the Princess and the Pauper,"My little girl is not a big Barbie fan, but she loves this movie. She is 4 and is horse-crazy right now. She has watched this movie over and over again. She watched Princess and the Pauper once.This movie is worth the money. It comes with 3-D glasses, but watching the show in 3-D is optional.This is a great movie for a young girl who loves horses, likes to dream, and reinforces the idea that girls can be strong, competant heroines."
2,On the Dark Side,I was disappointed in this movie - especially after Fairytopia - as this is much darker and sinister - I will not show it again to my 4 year old. While the villians in Fairytopia are on the comical side and not that threatening - there are dark and scary villians in this one (to a 4 year old) and abundant use of weapons/swordplay - not appropriate in my book. I can not rate the 3D - as we did not watch it in 3D - but my kids loved playing with the glasses ;-)
1,Does not live up to expectations,"I have watched this movie with my 4 year old daughter only once and had a very bad experience. This movie will not be seen or shown again in my house, at least not for a few more years. Perhaps its creators tried to make the movie ""more edgy,"" which is completely ununderstandable, as ""edgy"" is not something little girls want, and presumably they are the main audience for a Barbie movie. Those who are looking for gentle, beautiful princesses and polite knightly princes should not buy this movie. The characters are shallow and sometimes display a bad attitude. Their manners and style of conversation occasionally borders on bratty. The plot is rather forced. The ""bad guy"" is beyond bad and is way too scary. Only occasionally do we get to focus on the lovely colors and beautiful pictures for which we watch Barbie movies. I would highly recommend Barbie of Swan Lake and Barbie as Rapunzel instead. To sum up, this movie is just too much, too over the top for little girls."
2,Not for kid,I bought 2 Barbie DVD and this is one of them. It's dark and scary at the beginning and the story line is not that great compare with the other one I have (Mermaidia). It doesn't attract my daughter like Mermaidia and she doesn't like it that much. Don't buy this. Get the Mermaidia one.
5,Can't Wait to See!,"I can't wait to see this movie! It says it is supposed to be 3-D so that will be really neat! The characters and storyline are really good! By the way, check out the next movie Fairytopia: Mermaidia, it looks super cool."
2,BARBIE? AGAIN?,"Fairytopia was going far, and this movie is going WAY too far.I liked the first barbie movie. It was nice. But now I don'ttollerate it! Here's 5 facts why they shouldn't make this!1. There is at least 5 movies about barbie without this one.2. Bratz replaced barbie a year ago.3. Griffin ( a creature or a bad guy ) is a name, too, mattel!4. Barbie and Ken's "" breaking up "" is innappropiate.5. It's the same dumb money scheme.The only reason why this gets 2 stars is the 3-D feature."
4,Very good,The Dvd played perfectly. Then still had 3 out of the 4 3d glasses. My daughter is very happy.
4,a little too weird,OK this movie is a little too magical for me! Put the glasses on you cant see a thing! i like to watch it normal.
5,Best Barbie movie!,I rented this movie yesterday and I love it!It's better than her last movie!The horse in the movie has a cool secret!Whatch the movie to find out!
4,Movie arrived as described.,"The movie was okay. My daughter enjoyed, bu the story was lacking. The movie looked like it had been re-shrink wrapped."
4,"Eerie, Atmospheric, ridiculous","A very atmospheric film with an eerie feel throughout. I am a little more forgiving in my review of this film having read other reviews and seeing what it took for the director to complete this film. Filmed in Russia, it was anything but easy. The whole thing was destined for failure with the ripoffs, location changes, etc...Either way the director was able to pull off quite a nice film in the end. The ending, however, was thrown together with no real explanation for the ridiculous creature. I think this is one time where the visual gave a bit more than we needed. I feel that it should have kept with the mystery and maybe eluded to the evil behind the wall with only noises, growls whatever...Maybe even just a shadow of things to come so-to-speak. Anyway everything that leads up to the disappointing conclustion is beautiful, haunting and visually acceptable."
1,dead waters,"title is a little deceiving thats for sure. but surprised at all the good reviews this movie got. i like off the wall B movies and a few independent films if their entertaining and keep you involved in the movie but this movie is just plain sad.especially the end, you get a glimpse of the creature and can't really tell what's going on in the movie towards the end. does have good atmosphere and good acting but not very entertaining and not a very good movie to laugh at. was just plain disappointed, especially after i saw the ending. i'd stay away from this movie, but of course thats just my opinion."
4,Inside the Asylum: Why the UN and Old Europe are Worse Than You Think,"Corruptness, mismanagement, self-intrest and anti-Americanism are what we get for our billions of dollars spent for this bad endeavor. We all know it is bad, but should read this book to get the whole story that the media won't tell us."
2,There is a much better book-- hands down,"While this book is OK for a popular account of the problems with the UN. The finest criticque and analysis of the UN is by Michael J. Glennon, professor of international law at the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, Tufts University. He wrote ""Limits of Law, Prerogatives of Power: Interventionism After Kosovo"" (Palgrave, 2001). Limits of Law is, hands down, the most thorough, effective and devestating analysis of the UN ever published and the problems under international law. It is not an easy read because the author's thought process is acute and razor sharp. However, if you truly want to understand the UN and its problems this is THE book"
5,U.N. Apologists will not like this book,"This is a great book to read for all of those who reflexively defend the first-class, world country club that is the United Nations. This book chronicles the corruption and greed that seeps throughout the operation, and the disdain for America on one hand as they gladly hold out their hands for financing on the other.Typical of what a large majority of Americans expect out of the UN and Old (irrelevant) Europe.Cheers to Jed Babbin"
1,Fascistic farrago of fallacies,"Mr Babbin should note at least some of the following facts. The (unelected) Bush regime supports the integrationist EU. The UN General Assembly does represent the world's nations. The US state has consistently promoted the nuclear proliferation of its favoured allies - Israel and Pakistan for example. The author's technique is the McCarthyite smear - those who disagree with him (that is, most of the world's people) belong in an asylum.The reason why most of us think that the Bush regime is arrogant is simply that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld show the contempt for the decent opinion of mankind displayed by Mr Babbin."
1,Shorter Jed Babbin,The John Birch Society was right after all.And those commies under your bed are now Islamic terrorists. Dont' think. Just be afraid!
1,Voice of Fascism is on the air,"July 15, 2004. I just heard this person promoting his book on a local radio program. He says that the UN, France, Germany, Russia... well most countries are our enemies. The best countries are Turkey and Poland. Australia and New Zealand, for some reason also pass. He says that maybe Japan is okay. He doesn't care what any country thinks of the US, especially insignificant non-countries like France. He says the bad countries hate Bush because of his religion. He likes Bush because rather than waste time talking... he acts to set things straight.He seems to have been Bush One's Paul Wolfowitz. But obviously not that bright. Jed Babbin is a right wing fanatic who makes Limbaugh seem like Walter Cronkite. Pay attention to him if you think Hitler had the right idea."
5,Inside the Asylum is a MUST read this year!,"If you don't read another book this year ... you simply MUST read Inside the Asylum: Why the UN and Old Europe are Worse Than You Think. As he lays out his arguments with clarity, detail, and corroboration, Mr. Babbin will open your consciousness to the corruption, mismanagement, political chicanery, and abuse that is the UN today. The case is simply overwhelming that the UN has outlived its usefulness. He not only makes the case that the UN is utterly corrupt, he also provides suggestions about what to do about the problem. There can be no justification or excuse for the US to continue to pour money, time, effort, and lives down the UN rathole. Don't take my word for it, read the book and see for yourself just how critical it is for the US to leave the UN in the dustbin of history."
3,Unfortunately unreadable,"So sad, a very nice looking book with an interesting approach -- looking at Islamic art and architecture as seen through Western eyes over the last few hundred years. The book showcases some excellent reproductions of fabulous old paintings, historic photographs, and contemporary photographs. Why sad? because the narrative text is printed in light gray in a very skinny sans serif type that swims before my eyes. I admit I don't have perfect vision, but I can read most books perfectly well. In Moorish Style I can read a paragraph or two under a strong light, but it is so agonizing (actually nauseating) I soon give up.Curse the art director who came up with this great idea!! .... Books have to be more than just pretty.If it weren't for this 'slight' problem, I would give it four, maybe five stars. For the excellent graphics, I give it three."
5,Expired Product still Good,Purchased after expiration date cheap still good for pictures and keeping machine clean by using manufacture product
4,Good company to deal with!,"This company gave me fast service. I saved mmoney by purchasing HP ink cartridges, with free shipping."
5,The Geneva Saga Continues,"Ayden travels to England with his sister and her new husband. He plans to take over the family's English holdings. Taking charge of the manor he meets his next door neighbor, Paige. She is exquisitely beautiful and she falls for Ayden, literally.It is a battle for Ayden to win Paige. He has to battle an old enemy of the McGillinen's and an interferring mother who wishes to keep Paige under her control.Paige's father gets the two together and to protect Paige from the McGillinen enemy and Paige's mother is to take Paige to Geneva's Hope."
1,poor remains of good movie,"good movie but cut and screwed up, not what it used to be. real big disappointment. in future i will be more careful with movies from same distributor."
3,NOTE:The above review is for a different movie!,"Ignore the first review. it is for another movie entirely! ..On the Line is an action flick/love story of a prostitute in ""Boystown"" on the Texas-Mexico border. It has some fine actors and is pretty entertaining....It was made in Texas & Mexico by a director & crew from Spain!"
4,Olympus Stylus 720 SW,"I bought this camera because I am a fly fisherman... and every once in a while I fall in! After six months I am pretty happy with the camera. It takes good pictures, very sharp and good color. I miss having a view finder, even though the display is large it can be hard to see, especially in bright light. I skip all the special shooting modes, they are a waste of time. But it's light and durable and waterproof, and that is what I bought it for. I have not dunked it yet but have used it in all kinds of bad weather."
2,Needs work - not for the outdoorsy type.,"This camera can take some pretty nice pictures. But for outdoor pictures, which mine tend to be, you need to do a lot of button pushing. This camera won't save ""modes"" as default settings. I find that outdoor color quality stinks unless I have it on a particular mode. But the camera won't save that as a default. Olympus says that feature isn't available on this model. If you're a kayaker - this probably isn't the right camera for you."
4,"good camera, short battery life","i have owned this camera for about 3 months and i have dropped, used it under sea water and in rain storms and it hasnt missed a beat. my only complaint is short battery life. needs a charger that doesnt require removal of the battery. overall great product."
4,olympus waterproof camera,"takes good photos, but I don't like not having a viewfinder. The screen is hard to see outside, even with a shade over it. Battery does not last long, and the charging mechanism is bulky. Some of the features don't really do what they are supposed to do. Don't like how photo info is displayed over photo on the led screen when reviewing photos."
2,Water proof is the only good thing -,"The Olympus 720SW is great for in water shots and movies - surfing, snorkeling and boating. However, the good things end there. The camera (7.1MP) takes poor images for your average (out of water) shot. The shots are blurry and it is hard to find the proper settings in each condition. The Xd card is super slow, takes several seconds before the camera is ready to shoot again. My suggestion buy the canon elf and just take the extra time to put it in a waterproof housing. My 4MP canon elf takes a much better quality image. I will not buy another Olympus product, my next camera will be the 7.1MP canon elf."
1,Do NOT buy this camera,"This is the 5th digital camera I have owned and am trying to figure out a way to get rid of it! Bottom line*No way to remove picture information when reviewing shots...remains on the screen for about 3 seconds and is very annoying*Shots are ALWAYS blurry, unless you us the stabilizing mode. If you use this mode, it cancels out any other mode you try to select.*Recharger is very bulky and not travel friendly, combined with...*Short battery life.Positives are that this thing is bullet proof and can take underwater shots... that is about it! I strongly suggest you look at either Cannon or Sony cameras instead of this one."
2,It takes underwater pictures but........,I got this camera about two months ago. I took a lot of pictures and I am not happy about the camera. It takes a lot of blurry pictures. Almost all of the pictures I took are blurry. That's a shame. I am thinking about returning it.
2,too slow,This camera would be great if not for the latency between pressing the button and the actual taking of the picture. I sent mine back.
5,Camera Review,This camera was purchased for my teenage daughter. She likes it so much she sleeps with it! Great camera. Incredible pictures.
1,olympus is garbage,"i bought an olympus camera several years ago. huge mistake. worked once then stopped working 1st day on my trip to jamaica...got about 8 lousy quality pictures. olympus refused to repair it, so spent $35 to fix it. didn't finish a roll with it and took it about 10 months later to cancun. optimistic fool me. stopped working the 1st day after half a roll. lucky for me my friend had a kodak and got double prints. avoid this company. they make garbage and don't stand behind it. and take a spare camera along if u can."
1,Huge disappointment,"I was so very excited to find a camera that was rugged and could be used at shallow depths underwater. I shot some photos for a few weeks and tried to convince myself that the quality was satisfactory (200x sharpening in Photoshop Elements II among other fixes were needed). Then took it on my once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and floating on the surface I pointed the camera down (perhaps a few inches below the surface) and the screen went blank. I guess it is not water tight after all, and now will go back to the seller as a bad purchase. I know, I know -- I should have tested it under water before I left home rather than believe the specs but was too rushed to do it. I've owned 9 different cameras and this is the only one that has proven truly unsatisfactory."
3,Nice camera but not for the beginning photographer,"Takes nice pictures with a lot of practice. I like that it has preset scene selections to help get a good picture but found that I needed to take a lot, to get one really clear picture. My Sony Cybershot almost always takes really great clear pictures on the first try. Underwater function is cool but again I had to take lots of pictures to get one really good one. Video also works underwater, which was quite cool. Lens is hard to dry without spots after using it underwater. Hate the rechargeable battery. I would definately prefer to be able to use AA batteries like my Cybershot."
5,Awesome camera!,"I am always at the beach or canoeing and my fiance is always fishing, so this camera was a logical choice for us. We have only had it a week, but we love it. We felt slightly superior to the other passengers on the Busch gardens Log Ride this weekend. They were trying to protect their cameras from the water as we snapped away. Great purchase."
4,shockproof camera for young child,"We bought this camera for our (precocious) grandson's 4th birthday over a ""toy"" camera. It was a bit of an extravagance, but not that much more than we would have spent anyhow. The key appeal is its purported ""shockproof"" feature. We added a gel case for extra protection. The other thing that made it preferable to cameras made for 4-year-olds was a rechargeable battery. He is amazingly adept at operating the camera, using the menus, etc. And he LOVES that it's a ""real"" camera.So far so good on the shockproof..."
3,Good choice for butterfingers,"My last compact digital camera was a Canon SD700IS. It took much better pictures than the Olympus 720SW, until I accidentally dropped it and it busted to pieces. The compact digital camera before that was an Olympus that got wet and died when my sailboat capsized. Now I have a 720SW that has not gotten wet yet, but it has been dropped at least once, and it still works. In good light, it takes excellent pictures. In poor light that requires flash, it takes very grainy pictures. It is very small and easily fits in a pocket or purse. If I had to buy another camera, I'd probably choose this one again. But I really really hope I don't have to buy another camera any time soon."
3,nice but not perfect,"Just came back from snorkeling. Nice thing about this camera is that it is campact and waterproof, and it takes decent pictures. However, it is hard to see the LCD underwater, and it is hard to get a steady shot. The lens is poorly positioned, and your finger easily finds its way into the image. The battery doesn't last very long.Now it starts making very weak clicking sound when it is turned on and standing by, as if it is keep trying to sense and adjusting itself. Just in case you wondered, we never dropped it or let it soak for more than 1 hour at a time."
1,Does not take clear pictures,"I bought this camera new, does not take clear pictures, took if back to the camera shop and they said it was ok. I do not use it, it does not take clear picutres.I wasted about $400.00. Would not recommend. Yes you can drop it and put it in water but what good is it if it does not take good clear pictures?"
1,This was the biggest mistake of my purchasing life.,"I bought this camera years ago. I'm still so angry with it that I'm writing a review years later. It will help no one, because no one should be buying this camera anymore anyways, but I'm still so angry at its horrible picture quality that I can't sleep without writing a review.The pictures are terrible.The underwater shots are terrible.The microphone for video is terrible.It's waterproof and shock proof up to 5 feet. Great, but that doesn't help if you through it out your window deliberately.I will never, ever, purchase an Olympus again. I'm finally waiting for a new camera to arrive in the mail so this horrible horrible chapter in my life can be closed."
3,"Don't use as ""fancy camera""","I figure it's the perfect present for someone you don't like very much. Really. Very frustrating to learn and get used to.If you keep the resolution low, like for e-mailing, it makes an ok point and shoot. Otherwise, the multiple features only get in the way.Drop-able and waterproof are the reasons I bought it, and these attributes are great, I just which it took better pictures out of the box.Oh, and it keeps reseting itself to the default camera usage settings when every you turn it off. I almost was kicked out of a museum in Texas for using a flash, because I had to keep resetting it every time I turned it back on."
1,Awful pictures!,"I have a small child so I thought the shockproof would be a good idea. What a mistake!!! I've taken about 100 pictures (indoors, outdoors, low light, good light) and almost all of them are either blurry or the color/flash is way off. I've tried changing the settings to no avail. I have a much older Sony digital camera -- other than power up, its speed is comparable to this piece of junk. At least my old bulkier slower Sony takes decent pictures. I'm returning my new Olympus! I'm incredibly disappointed."
1,Avoid this camera,"I purchased this camera in December. It was broken out of the box. The resulting images are rotated about 15 degrees clockwise. I sent the camera back to olympus for repair, ad received it back in exactly the same broken condition. I called olympus repeatedly to try to get the camera repaired or replaced (it is still under warranty) and have had no luck thus far. In short, avoid Olympus products, particularly this one. Check out a Sony."
4,Bobby McFerrin can do it all,"I listen to artist such as Bootsy Collins, Jimi Hendrix, and Funkadelic. I never listened to classical or even considered it. I just happened to pick up this cd and give it a try. I remember Bobby McFerrin from ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" and decided to buy this cd. Man! This cd has added another demension to music for me. I don't know much about classical music but thanks to this cd I plan on learning and listening to much more. This cd kind of has a jazzy essence to it. Its like McFerrin added some of his own jazzy grooves to the classical writings. Bobby McFerrin is a very talented musican, vocalist, and conductor."
3,Tiring,"I grew up with Klemperor conducting Brahms and always found it restless. It is tough. Brahms was a tragic figure full of angst and if you want to blow off steam then get Klemperor who also had ghosts. Now it tires me and I went exploring. I found a pastoral Brahms: Mendelsohn meets Beethovens 6th via Smetana. Its called Haitink and the LSO. Its magicland.Klemperor is too close to the music, the listener is forced to ride every turbulent wave. Haitink withdraws and keeps it at a distance, strangely you get more detail but its not tiring,the detail is beautiful and fulfilling."
2,Excessive errors,"Admittedly, 0.99 is practically free but I have found the number of typos, misspellings, gibberish, missing content, etc., in this version very annoying.I don't know how the content was prepared - by scanning old books, typing, or speaking - but it was obviously never edited for accuracy or quality after completion. I have downloaded inexpensive or free items before but the quality has always been good. For a classic document to be this poorly done is not a good advertisement for Amazon."
5,savage Country,This is excellent reading. I just love the way this auther covers all thedetail and does not leave one hanging.
5,Canyon Mystery,"The story of Glen and Bessie Hyde is the greatest Grand Canyon mystery. They are the honeymoon couple that disappeared without a trace in 1928. Many myths and legends have evolved in the intervening years (including a segement of ""Unsolved Mysteries""). Brad Dimmock is a Colorado River guide (and a very good writer) who duplicated the couples ill fated journey down the Colorado. He has interwoven the historical material with his own modern attempt using a sweepboat similiar to the one the Hyde's used. I read this while visiting the canyon again. It was great sitting on the patio at the Lodge on the North Rim reading this fascinating account. If you love a great mystery or you love Canyon lore, you'll love this book."
3,Sad Short Story,"The Hyde's story on the surface has the elements of intrigue: ambition, adventure, love, death, mystery. But what follows is a strangely distant account of two individuals who miscalculated and died. Through their own actions, their dream of fame and fortune failed fatally and publicly. The result of this failure, ie. their disappearance, is the focus of this book. The actual mystery is more complex: their personalities, motivations, and experiences, all which eventually led to their demise. And that mystery still remains."
1,Fantastic Mystery!,"This book is one of those can't put it down books. It is well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. You end up with all kinds of ideas on what happened to Glen and Bessie. It is full of actual photos from Glen and Bessie on this trip. If you like true life mysteries, get this book."
1,Self-serving book by a gallery owner,"This book does not reflect art in Alaska. Rather, it is a self-serving piece of work by a gallery director to promote sales in her gallery. If you want to pay [$$$] for a 'Vanity Press' book, this is it. However, it in no way represents real and important art in Alaska."
3,Not quite what I expected...,"I must not have read the listing well enough... The large port is 2 1/4"" in diameter, and does not fit my 2 1/2"" diameter hose. I also didnt realize that the hose was so thin, but this does help in making it easier to use when attached to the sander. It does do the job, just not sure how long it will hold up to shop conditions."
1,A complete waste of money,"The small diameter, coupled with the length and deep-ridged construction causes this hose to produce so much friction that there is no vacuum to speak of and therefore NO DUST COLLECTION. I first connected this to my 2hp cyclonic dust collector. There was barely any air movement at the 1"" end of th hose. I then used my 6.5hp shop vac with similar results. I went back to duct-taping a 2"" hose to the underside of my bosch sander handle which works fine, except that the hose is a little unwieldy. Better unwieldy that dust all over my shop and the work. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,Screaming Banshee,Beware of this product. I purchase the Vac001 to use with my Bosch detail sander and orbital sander. I hooked it up to my 6.5 HP shop vac and it screamed like a banshee. I called Bosch and said that some of them do this and I should return it. I did so and hooked up the second Vac001 to my Shop vac and had the same results. I called Bosch again and they admitted that it won't work with an more powerful Shop Vac.
4,Works for me.,"I agree with the other comments that it is a light weight plastic. But that is what I like about it. When using a hand held router or sander the other heavy hoses tend to pull against you. I also like the hose because it is extra long. My shop vac hose is only about 6 feet. The 15' in this hose lets you move around the work piece with out having to lug the shop vac with you.I've used this hose for about 3 months now. I've even stepped on it a few times and have not had it collapse on me. Maybe my shop vac is not strong enough, but even then there is a flow control to reduce the suction in the hose.In my opinion this product is fine. Maybe after several more months or years of use these other folks comments will come true."
3,An alternative,"After reading the comments on Amazon and elsewhere, looking at the unnecessarily large hose shown in the picture, and looking at the price, I decided to try to make an adapter for my existing Porter-Cable #39332 hose. No luck at the local auto supply store, but the local plumbing supply house found that a 1"" O.D. grey plastic coupling with outside threads on both ends worked great. They carefully tapped the inside of the outlet on my Bosch 1294 detail sander and screwed the coupler inside. The PC 39332 intake (1"" I.D.) slides snugly over the other end of the coupler."
1,Disinchanted,Did not come with the tip that screws on to the top of the plug. usless with out it.Tossed it into the junk draw.
4,Plug for Harley,I installed a pair of these plugs in my Harley after reading great reviews about the performance of the plugs. After installing I noticed a slight difference in the performance of my bike. Bike seemed to start and idle better.
2,Not that great,This did not do much for perfomance...the original plug works much better. I use this plug now as a back up.
5,Very good quality plugs,"Installed these plugs into a 2009 1200 sportster, they are great plugs. Highly recommend this product. The pricing is fair and if you buy at the auto parts store you are going to pay more.."
4,Iridium Spark Plugs ordered for older Honda Rebel,"Took a bit to find some platinum style, Iridium spark plugs for our older Honda Rebel.Going to NGK site directly and working the search helped identify the correct plug.Installation was a breeze because we did not have to gap the plugs ourselves. Bike seems to be running stronger - but the intent was to make sure it has the best, fresh plugs."
5,the best,"These spark plugs are among the best, they last the longest and never foul. the shipping is a little slow but worth the wait"
5,Great Plug.,Great plug. On sale its just a few dollars more than a copper core plug. Seeing that this is for use in single cylinder engines a 3 or 4 dollars is not much to spend for such an important part of the overall engine performance. Ive had great luck not fouling this plug on my CR250. It starts real well even after a crash (usually anyway) not that I like to test anything by crashing :) but it happens.
4,testing,"Bought this plug to try in my Aprilia Scooter. I wanted to see if I had a performance change using the Iridium plug. I really can't notice any big improvements. Too early to tell if mileage gets better. The plug comes with a threaded end and I needed a terminal cap to use it with my scooter - that was hard to find - parts store guy stole one off another plug and gave it to me - none of the parts houses here in Boise carry the terminal screw on cap - what a pain - I suggest (the manufacturer) putting one on the plug and letting us (the consumer) take it off if we don't need it, instead of making us search for one if we do.:)>>"
5,Half the price of regular stores,"Everywhere I looked these were 20.00, I wanted the best plug I could get for my 150cc scooter and this definitley fit the bill."
3,it made no difference,"I paid almost $70 for this air filter,thinking my van(2002 GMC Savanna 3500)will get better mileage.But it did not happened,it made no difference.I don't think you will get better mileage with this air filter.If you will keep your vehicle for 5 years or more than buy it."
4,K&N Air Filters,"With expensive paper replacment filters, this K&N air filter investment pays for it self in no time."
4,The Hunted,"This book is an easy read but lacks an easily followed story line. What child? Where is the child? Lauren does not react to that line when it is uttered.What about Lauren's experience with the killer in the cabin. That exciting event is left out of the text and not mentioned again in any meaningful way as the story now continues its march toward Virginia.Also, I don't particularly like or see the necessity for the numerous ""collateral"" deaths toward the end.All in all, however, the writer held my attention.Frannie in Missouri"
2,Couldn't finish it,"Check this one out from your public library and save yourself $4.99. If your library uses Overdrive, you can borrow the kindle edition.I couldn't get past page 5. This book contains numerous examples of bad writing: adverbs and adjectives everywhere to prop up weak verbs and nouns (respectively), info-hiding, direct (as opposed to clever or original) dialogue, and no actual setup of a plot. I could not sympathize or identify with either character--I was simply bored. Jacobson tries to make up for this with shock. Yawn. As soon as I saw ""decimated"" used as if it meant ""obliterated,"" I deleted it from my Kindle."
4,The Hunted,"See story summary above.I have to agree that this is definitely a page turner. The cat and mouse thrills are here, as is the suspense. When I started reading the book I was thinking of comparing it to Baldacci. The further I got into it the more I decided I was wrong. Though the action is exciting, it's a little far fetched. Some of the scenes actually made me stop reading and say to myself, ""Yea, right"". The entertainment value is there if you can swallow some of the action scenes. I think with each novel, Alan Jacobson's writing improves.Recommended."
5,Hunted - Excellent Second Novel,"Alan Jacobson writes in an engaging fashion that makes you not want to put the book down. It is clever how he mentions Philip Madison from False Accusation in the beginning of Hunted. It is a page turner, with an excellent unexpected ending."
5,the hunted,"as a long time mystery reader I find Mr. Jacobsons' books two of the best I have read in a long time. I knew he had some strange twists in The Hunted and I was determined to see if I could spot them---sure enough he slipped some by me---there is so much action and the plot carries you forward, you just can't stop reading--the characters are not super heros, but everyday people caught up in strange but believable happenings. When I finished the book I thought what a great movie this would make."
3,A little too long,"I liked this book well enough but I have to agree with a former reviewer that this story was slow-paced. If some parts could have been edited out (instead of dragging everything out for so long), it would have been better. Other than that, it's not bad."
3,Too Complicated!!,This book was too long and drawn out. Just wasn't interesting. I was totally surprised considering Mr Jacobson's previous novel was awesome. Hopefully his next novel is better.
4,A different kind of DBZ movie,"Long ago a monster was sealed away by two brothers. They used magical flutes to imprison it. In the present a stranger named Hoy arrives on Earth with the intention of reviving the monster. The Z fighters must rely on the spirit of the one that sealed it away.This is one of the weirdest DBZ universe films. It is mainly about a day in the life of a bored and mischievous Trunks. He befriends a stranger and has his friendship tested. It's proof that Vegeta is a crappy father until he sees Trunks die at the hands of Cell, or when he saves the lives of Goten and Trunks in the battle with Buu. This movie is definitely different. I can see many people not caring for it much. I liked it though. It's nice to get a new look at DBZ. I think it's worth giving a chance."
5,Probably the best DBZ movie for effects and storyline.,"Wrath of the Dragon is definitely an alternate storyline. However this is the case because it is directly linked to the Trunks storyline. Without giving a spoiler, you find out the origin of the sword that Trunks carries in the series. In the manga which gives more details, young Trunks, in his timeline, defeated the monster at a very high cost to the planet. Of course, this movie is the ""what if"" Goku survived after Majin Boo and faced the monster."
3,The Wrath of the dragon,it's.....good great visial it needs more action more in depth and gohan become a ssj again 3.4/5 it's not worth buying unless you LOVE!! dbz
3,OK I guess....,Well I watched this on youtube and I felt the ending was quite retarded and not enough action in this movie but I still think its good not buying good but good.
3,Not Happy at all!!!,"I thought this was the perfect kitchen when I saw it online. My five year old wants one very much, so I had Grandma order it. After seeing it in the toysrus I am taking it back. My daughter had to get on her knees to play with it. It is very small and not very practical. I will say it is built for a 2 year old but in the mind of a 5-12 yr old. A very smart kitchen, just not very well thought out."
3,Where are the accessories?,"My 8 year old daughter wanted this kitchen for Christmas and loves it.....although it is very small. A taller kitchen would really be helpful. Also, she got tired of the few foods that came with it pretty quickly, but I can't find the additional food kits ANYWHERE!! I tried calling the manufacturer directly and they told me they should be available at Wal-Mart....but I've looked and they are nowhere to be found. Help?If your child is 6 and up....you may want to consider putting it on a small table or finding a kitchen more suited to an older child. Great idea.....just give us the accessories!"
5,A Great Play Kitchen Set !,"This Barbie kitchen play set is very nice and is just the right size for those of us with not alot of room for large toys, and if your child is 5 yrs old, like mine. I put it up on a small table so my child doesn't have to play with it on her knee. She loves how chef barbie helps her cook, and how the smart chip recognize the food you are cooking. This is on of the best toys she got for Christmas. I would recommend this playset to all my family and friend who has a child boy or girl who loves to play cooking!"
3,Not fully functional,"Loved it but my top burners NEVER worked. I also wish there was an ""off and on"" button. Even though there is an off (whish really doesn't turn it ""off"")..sometimes it will go ""off"" in the middle of the night - little scary! I am returning it."
4,very cute couple glitches,"I just got this toy for my daughter's 6th b-day. I ordered it on line from wal-mart and when it arrived the batteries that came in it were corroded. Then the thing wouldn't come on after I replaced the batteries. I finally took the back off and found that a connection cord had come loose and now it works perfectly. My other problem is is that I thought it would come with a whole turkey and instead it only came with 2 wings. All in all it's a great toy and I have enjoyed many meals that my daughter has ""prepared"" for me. She loves it and that's all that matters."
1,What a waste of money!,I thought it was over priced but there were so many good reviews so I took a chance. OOps that was a mistake. My stove malfunctioned after a few times playing with it. My four year old daughter was bored in no time at all. It is neat that the food has microchips in it but there is a warning that if the food is placed in drawer under stove ( the only storage place on this toy) that microchips could no longer work. Please don't waste your money on this toy. (...)
5,billy ray cyrus - trail of tears,"this is my favourite cd It is excellent, as are all of his cd'sKeep up the good work Billy Ray Cyrus"
5,The Best!,"If you only buy one Billy Ray Cyrus album in your lifetime, let it be Trail Of Tears. This album is Billy Ray and Sly Dog making the music they want with no outside interference from anybody, what you get is country music's most underated album of all time. It contains 3 cover's that Billy Ray gives his own sound to. Harper Valley PTA should have been his second biggest hit. He rocks on Tenntucky, and gives his most personal performance on the title track and Call Me Daddy."
3,Shamrock is good - Gracie is better,"I feel that this book serves it purpose quite well- it examines the mans life, and then serves as an instruction manual on Submission fighting. However, Shamrock is not that good!! He is not a proven fighter, and his style is severely lacking in depth and grace. For grace, look to the Gracies."
1,Shamrock Fans MUST READ,If you are a Ken Shamrock fan you owe it to yourself to get this book. It will tell you everything you ever wanted to hear.
2,Gives himself WAY too much credit,The first half of this book reads like a sixth grade book report. There are many contradictions of his opinions of the people he has fought and takes FAR TOO MUCH credit for a not so illustrious NHB career. This is a book that just strokes Shamrock's ego. The training part is worth reading though.
1,a slobbernoker,This boook is not a vary goood becauase it has tooo muny pags i dudent lick it and will not tell pople too by it . Must by book for all reasons.
1,Thisss boook ise ntoe verryy godo,"Thisss boook ise ntoe verryy godo, it ise aboout a mane thate ise obvosle fakeee"
3,"Good exrecises, good story. Badly written","I don't want to hate on this book, because Ken already gets plenty, but it wasn't exactly the best book I've read.Firstly, the exercise instruction is good! As others have mentioned, Hindu squats and such were printed here way before it became mainstream. When I first read this book I took on much of the workout he prescribed and I was working it hard! I also found it inspiring.So, it's not all bad.Also, despite his setbacks, Ken really does have a heartfelt story. And it is also a good insight into the early days of UFC and MMA.But the bad bit is the writing. It is written by a sports journalist and that is how it reads. It's like a sport feature, but instead of being 2,000 words, it's 65,000+ and it is hard to read a news article for that long!Anyway, could be worse I guess, but it could have been a lot better."
2,"Well written, but a disappointment.","This book is well written, informative, and entertaining. Why the two star rating, you ask? The author's positive bias destorys the book's credability. The book didn't need this bias in order to describe Ken's triumph over his past and his inner demons. He is a man who has gone from being a thug to a more complete human being (who now plays a Thug on TV.) This is the real story, and his wins and losses (especially against Severn) doesn't change that. Too bad the author didn't understand this."
3,One-sided bibliography,"This book is divided into two sections. The first section is the short history of Ken Shamrock by Richard Hanner. The second section is the ""fundamentals"" of Shamrock's submission system. Part 1 is highly one-sided. The events being written are seen from Shamrock's perspective an undercuts all his opponents, over-glorifying some of his wins, and making weak excuses for his rare losses. Part 1 should only be read when the reader has enough background info her/himself to compare and contrast what went on in Shamrock's mind. Part 2 is basically something you would read in a boxer's workout handbook. Shamrock does have unique and seemingly effective holds for submission and intoduces more positions than the regular 5 (he lists 10). The photos flow poorly when it comes to instructional value. This book is only for Ultimate Fighting Championship or WWF followers."
4,Great information hidden in jumbled text,"So far I've only read the first half of the book on the biography of Ken Shamrock. There is priceless information about his life from childhood on up. There is great stuff on his physical and mental strength as well as his philosophy on fighting and life. However, the book jumps back and forth leaving the reader somewhat jumbled up. The grammar of Richard Hannar is by no means impressive. His sometimes fantastic descriptions leave out valuable information that lead to a not so realistic view of what took place (people who witnessed the fights will know). Shamrock, however, is without a doubt one of the most successful and influential mixed martial arts fighters of this era."
4,Invaluable book to own,"If you want to know about Shamrock's life, get this. If you want to know about his conditioning methods, get this. If you want fighting techniques, this is skimpy. There are a few grappling techniques and a few hitting techniques. While you probably won't be a champion fighter from reading it, the techniques are good for someone wanting simple self defense, though I am sure there are better books for that. The bio was a good, interesting, and quick read. The conditioning is the best part of this book and what makes it ""Invaluable."""
4,Inside look at the world's most dangerous man,"part 1 is quick, simple reading that provides a look into the life of ken shamrock, the world's most dangerous man. i enjoyed the inside look at ken's thoughts about the UFCs. this part also provides an overview of ken's life growing up, helping you to understand his motivations and inner rage. part 2 alone is worth the full price of the book. it is filled with valuable information for any serious shootfighter or grappler."
5,A WINNER..A VERY INSPIRATIONAL BOOK...I CRIED !!!!!!!!!,"THIS BOOK IS A ""MUST READ"" FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON. IT WILL PROVE TO THEM THAT YOU CAN OVERCOME ANYTHING IF YOU HAVE POSITIVE INPUT. IF GIVEN LOVE AND GUIDANCE, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. FROM BEING BASICALLY A HOMELESS CHILD. TO BECOMING THE ""WORLD CHAMPION"" IN ULTIMATE FIGHTING, TO NOW BEING A WWF SUPERSTAR...WHAT A ""POSITIVE"" ROLE MODEL TO TODAYS YOUTH. KEN SHAMROCK, I WISH YOU THE BEST IN LIFE....YOU DESERVE IT AFTER THE BATTLE YOU HAVE ENDURED..."
2,"too dated, too early 80ish",oh this cd [stinks]!!! the best songs on it is 'i'm a rainbow' and'don't cry for me argentina' though madonna's version of the stunner is better...it sounds too campy and homemade...no wondersummer's record company shelved this thing. only for dieharddonna summer fans who love all of donna's stuff including thefrisbee 'shout it out.'
5,An Artistic Watermark-Summer's strongest Album,"After the success of ""Wanderer"", Donna Summer recorded a follow-up album in 1981, ""I'm A Rainbow"". This album reveals the soul of Summer. More than any album previously recorded. here she sings about the hard won truths about the search for love; ""I Believe In You"", ""True Love Survives"" and ""I Need Time"". There are deeply intimate songs here too, like; ""You To Me"",and ""Sweet Emotion"". more autobiographical material (ala Once upon A Time), ""I'm A Rainbow"", the compelling ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"" (which Donna transforms into a message to her public) and ""Brooklyn"" (a song celebrating the birth of her second daughter Brook Lynn Sudano). Here too are fun songs that are great to dance to; ""Romeo', ""Runner With The Pack' and ""End Of The Week"". And if that's not enough, there's a telling Celtic Rock song""To Turn The Stone"". To sum it up! ; the album is a mixed bag of various musical gems. if you don't have it already, buy it now! It's a must have album."
5,DURAN DURAN AT ITS BEST!!,"5 reasons why you should buy this awesome DVD :1- The audio and visual quality are absolutely amazing!2- The band has never sounded this good live.It's incredible to hear how they manage to sound even better than on their actual cd's,especially Simon Le Bon.3- They play their greatest hits and for the hardcore fans there are even songs like the chauffer,careless memories,planet earth..what a treat!!4- The stage,the huge screens and the audience participation are nothing short of breathtaking!5- They set the bar way too high for other bands as far as live shows go,proving us once more why they were one the greatest pop bands ever to come out of the wonderful 80's era.Just get it...YOU'LL LOVE IT!!"
5,Bringing back the memories,"As a long time Duran Duran fan (I go all the way back to the beginning) this DVD brings my love for these guys and my memories flooding back. I must admit, when Roger and Andy left the band I lost interest in them as to me is just wasn't Duran Duran without the 5 original guys. Now that they've come back to the fold, well lets just say this DVD truly brings back the passion for performing that they shared. My biggest regret is that I never had the pleasure of seeing them live, but this DVD is almost like being there in the front row. Even if you are just a casual fan I highly recommend seeing it. It will give you a new appreciation for them. Even my 8 year old son loves the DVD. It was great seeing them perform all of their older music (How much do I love New Religion and Careless Memories.. WOW). I hope that they decide to do another tour and it comes back to New England. I will make sure that I don't miss them this time!!"
3,Somewhat disappointing...from a old timr Duranie,"Sure it looks good and sounds good; maybe too good! You see, this footage, especially the vocals have been pitched corrected beyond the beyond!And Simon's vocals are not even in sync. Either he re-recorded the vocals or the soundtrack was recorded on a different night than the video footage. Why don't they give us a real show with a few bad notes and all and the real sound coming out of their voices and guitars on the actual night??? It's too flawless! If you've seen other Duran videos or bootlegs, then you know that they aren't pitch perfect and really and truly, that rawness is what makes them as great as they are.PLUS, they only gave us the hits with only a two new songs thrown in.Give us the whole deal un-edited please!The documentary is nice and this out of sync thing isn't for every song, but it's painfully apparent on quite a number.Sorry boys..."
2,Boring,"Boring. Predictable. Acting is below average at best. The giant avalanche actually looked computer generated to me, as did the less threatening breaking of the snow. Typical storyline in that one person warns of a super avalanche pending, but others don't believe it for various reasons."
2,needed more,"this movie could have been very good if it had more action in it, there were to many same cut on movie used for avalanche seens come on people we know when you are using the same part over and over to cut cost. There were also some dead spots where the movie just did not move or were boring but for the most part you could watch it. I would have been very upset if i went to see this at the movie up to look at it on video it's alright."
2,too artificial,It is too artifical. Many of the scenes were too unnatural quite predictable. I couldn't believe in this story.(reviewe by Angela)
1,A Waste,"This movie was completely predictable. I sat through the whole movie, waiting for the plot to start. The characters were undeveloped. THe story line was not plausable. If an avalanche like this was to happen, why is it that more people didn't get hurt. The movie tried to combiine a love story with a disaster story. This can only be done right in Twister. I am a huge fan of disaster movies. I have seen most of them (Twister, Day AFter Tomorrow, Independence Day, Jaws, and many others). This has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. And even on top of that, the sync with the voices was off."
4,My bible growing up...,"As a lefty child, this book was my bible. I searched high and low for a copy last year after realizing as a grow-up that it was still a book I could enjoy. It does a great job of de-mystifying dominant-handedness while dispensing some interesting biological facts about it (how it's a recessive gene, for example.) It's filled with humorous drawings and fun factoids (did you know that Gerald Ford writes left-handed sitting down, and right-handed standing up?) that anyone -- not just a lefty -- will appreciate. As an added bonus, it succeeds in its goal to provide a good source of self-esteem for lefties who feel left-out."
3,Welcome to the twilight zone,"Not what I expected at all. If you are looking for a serious study of the left-hander THIS ISN'T IT. This is a childrens book, however it is a very funny one. The book cracked me up, probably worth what I paid for it. Good to read to children asking about left handers. It even has childrens pictures."
3,NOT for kids!,"My 8 year old daughter has been frustrated with being the only lefty in her class, so I ordered this book after one review said that it was geared toward a younger person, & thought it would encourage her. I'm really thankful that I read the book before giving it to her!!! There are interesting facts, fun illustrations and captions, but the scene where two men are looking at a brain is TOTALLY inappropriate for a young person!! First man: "" Looks like the right cerebral hemisphere to me."" Second man: "" Either that, or group sex.""So I guess if you're looking for a gag-type gift for an adult lefty, it might be okay, but this book is definitely not for children!I would tear out the page, but the opposite page goes into more detail of what each side of the brain does. I may just use white-out, but that would look tacky, too, so I'm not sure whether this will be a gift for her or go in the trash."
1,"Rude, rude, rude.","As a lefty, the ideas presented in this book are outdated, insulting and disrespectful. I am returning this book. It should be taken our of print and not sold until it is revised. Shame on you for offering it!"
2,Morre of a kid's book.,"I thought that this book might be a little more scholarly or scientific. Instead it turns out to be more like a fun facts book on being left handed. I have many left handed friends, so I'm sure I'll be able to give it to one of them."
3,kind of too basic,"it's okay, I expected a little more grown-up presentation but it is interesting. it was a gift, unusual thing to give. he liked it."
1,ignorant,I received this book as a gift thought this is an insult to lefties. Yes we are special not were. I'm adult I wouldn'trecommend this book to any children. Personally don't think this book is humorous. Very ignorant find the person who wrote this book must of been a. right (y)Really don't know nothing about us lefties. By the way have a HEART it is on the LEFT side of the body...
1,Superiority of a Left Hander,"I didn't realize it was written for a young child...I must not have read the summary. It is fine for a young child, but somehow I thought it would be a little more adult."
3,"Interesting Facts, but not what I was looking for.","This had fascinating facts about Lefties, but not exactly the insight I was hoping to find. Definitely a good gift for anyone you know who is a lefty and might feel insecure about it. Very fast read...approximately 30 minutes from cover to cover!"
2,I Wanna Learn To Serge,"This book is NOT for beginners despite the name and is a disappointment. It contains projects but has little if any pictures and is totally narrative. You cannot learn to serge by ""jumping in with both feet and doing"" despite what the author claims. If you are just beginning, you need to know the basics like what the different stitches are and what they are used for. This book might be an OK book for those who are past the beginning phase in serging and I might be able to use it later on. A MUCH better book to buy is ""The Complete Serger Handbook"" by Chris James. It is a better investment of your time and money."
2,Not keen on it,"This book was all about simple (and ugly) projects, rather than the how-to basics book I was looking for. Ugly graphics, too."
4,VISIUAL ACOUSTICS: THE MODERNISM OF JULIUS SHULMAN,"Loved it. My daughter's home was one of the homes featured (John Lautner home). His photography of the mid-century homes was so well done...with his timing of the shots to get the best light and angles...one of the best and a beautiful, humble person as well."
4,Very Interesting,Very interesting and I think a must-see for aspiring architecture photographers out there; A good history lesson and an inspiration.
2,The Transition From Porn To Mainstream Isn't An Easy One To Make.,"It's painful to watch Moran struggle through this film, clearly trying too hard to prove herself as a legitimate actress. Zimpel is adequate, given the material he's working with. I didn't necessarily want these 32 minutes back, as the film was mildly entertaining. However, I don't think I would pay $15 to view it."
1,Neo Prog? OK !,I will admit that this band gets closer than other bands of this supposed genre: NEOPROG . This band has Floyd influences and a touch of Genesis and IQ. I was a bit skeptical at first but they are very good musicians and good writers. This particular release unleashes the best of their history and it's pretty faithful to it. Takes a few listens but al in all very good!
4,Really easy to use,Works as indicated. Very easy to get in the truck and get down the road quickly. I'd definitely recommend this product.
3,"After only 4 uses, ratchet system broke loose from frame.","Just what I was looking for in an easy to use, removable bike rack for my tacoma. BUT after just four uses the cheap rivet attaching the ratchet system to the frame broke loose. This is a big flaw since this holds the strap that locks the rack into the tailgate. This ratchet system seems cheap to me for a rack that costs almost $150. These ratchets should be fastened to the frame using bolts - not some cheap rivets that can pop loose! Once I fix this flaw hopefully I can get a few years of use out of this thing."
3,Unstable,"The bike carrier works Okay, but the rachet straps slip and do not allow it to be tightened down very well. This leads to the whole unit moving around. It is quick to get the bike in and out of it though. I would suggest looking at different options before buying this unit."
1,Ratchet straps are not attached securely!!!,"I bought this carrier, and before I could even use it, one of the ratchet straps fell off. I returned it to Amazon for a new one. On the replacement carrier one of the straps was not even attached when I opened the box. So all in all I have had two of these and not been able to use either one even one time. Perhaps I was just unlucky, but I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is poorly constructed with rivets that don't hold the straps on, so I would be wary of even using this thing with a bike, since the straps can't remain attached when they are not under load. At least Amazon is good about returns, but even so my experience with this item is you will be out the high cost of a really low quality item for as long as it takes to receive a refund and be making a few trips to the UPS Store."
3,Good but not perfect,"The insta-gator will not work on a bike with a front fender. That I discovered only by looking at the installation picture (no fender on the bike used). The other (minor) problem is that my truck bed is high off the ground and my bike heavy. That means I have to open the tailgate to load / unload the bike. When I do that, the insta-gator comes loose and that means it has to be re-adjusted when the tailgate goes up again. For daily use, I found this annoying. However, once adjusted and the bike in place, it is secure and does a good job of holding the bike."
4,Gator Rack,"If you are looking to haul one bike in a pickup, and want the simplicity of moving the bike without taking the wheel off then this works great. It is very easy to use and holds the bike firmly without marking it. I also didn't want to mount a bar across the my bed, and have to deal with the cover getting in the way when rolled up. This just locks into the tailgate and wrenches down and you are done. I rated it 4 stars becuase - it didn't come with the lock and it is more expensive than other options out there, but to me worth the money."
5,holy sh#$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This band is amazing!!!! A perfect blend of hardcore/metal and punk and it's done right!!! I think this band will change what people think is ""hardcore"" back to what it should be!!"
1,The Work of a Beginner,"I was very disappointed in this book. I like to support new and promissing local talent, but this book is minus one star rating. The book rambles, and this reader really had to struggle to finish the book; which I did do in order to judge it fairly. A very poor attempt, hopefully this author has a day job to fall back on. I feel I am open minded and the subject matter of homosexual living is immaterial. The structure of the book, the unlikeable characters, the presentation all combine to make the book a real chore to read. There are too many good books available to waste ones time on this one!!!"
4,Very engaging!,"As someone who commutes on the New York City subway system two hours a day, a book has to be QUITE engaging in order to keep me reading and focussed. While reading Within These Walls, I almost missed my stop several times! I found the style of the book (which switches narrators and narrative styles) very interesting, as it keeps the plot line fresh and offers multiple perspectives on the various events of the story. While I sometimes questioned certain aspects of the characters' personalities, I found the events in the plot compelling enough to continue reading. The author's use of language made me laugh out loud in several parts (remember, I mostly read on the subway!), while other parts of the plot had me close to tears. Overall, I enjoyed Within These Walls very much, and I look forward to reading other books by this author -- he appears to have great potential!"
1,NEVER AGAIN!,"I ordered a watch from this seller on Dec. 24th of 2011 and STILL have not received this item. I have sent 3 emails and have spoke to them via phone twice. The first time I was told that the factory where the watch was made was shut down for a few days. I contacted Bulova and they ensured me that the plant was not closed other than for Christmas. The second time I called the seller I was told the watch was being delivered to there store within 2 days and the watch would be shipped to me and I would receive it in 5 days. That was 10 days ago. After 2 unreturned calls within the past 3 days, I have decided to finally post the negative review that this seller deserves. As a side note, I order items via Amazon on a regular basis and understand that reasons arise for a late delivery so have never posted negative feedback prior to this. This review is based on the severe lack of customer service I have received."
5,"Good quality, everyday sliverware","Have had this for 2 years, this is my second set to add to my existing set. Holds up well, looks great."
1,This is the *WRONG* SEDUCERS movie!,"The cover art for this title clearly indicates this version of The Seducers isn't the one with the stars depicted in Amazon's description, nor the video summary details mid-way through this page.This DVD displayed, entitled The Seducers is about the jet set, which is a completely different story altogether.Peter Traynor's Death Game (AKA The Seducers) is about two girls who torment a middle-aged businessman the entire weekend his wife is away & nothing to do with this film whatsoever.This is NOT Death Game (AKA The Seducers) from 1977 with Seymour Cassel, Sondra Locke & Colleen Camp. Furthermore, whatever this movie is, is stated to be a DVD-R & NOT a retail product, as Peter Traynor's 1977 film is, which is available on this site for purchase.BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
4,Good Preview,Great book to read before you go to St. Andrews. Will give you good background and make a trip to the Old Course and the area even more special.
1,Nothing Good About It,"I can not find one good thing about MS Office that I can't get from a cheaper alternative. MS Office tries to ""read your mind"" and ends up formatting your document in goofy ways. When it crashed it asks you to send an error report, the report contained data from my Excel file! It takes forever to load and to install and if you do not do the step by step (ugh!) install you end up having to put the disk in every other week to get the feature that was not originally installed.In short:If you want to share personal info with MSIf you want your work to look like MS wants it toIf you want to ""never"" be done installing to softwareIf you think wasting $$ is goodThenBuy this product. Other wise look at Star Office or another product."
1,overpriced,"This software is incredibly over priced for ANY level of usibilty. There is No reason for you to pay this much for anything Microsft unless it will run a server, give you lifetime on site support, and make you coffee. Consider something less costly with the same useability like StarOffice or gobeProductive."
1,Waste of Money,"Man, did I waste my money! I used Office97 before, and have switched back to it. Office continues it's steady march toward doing this FOR you, instead of offering useful tools. There is nothing useful in this package that O97 doesn't have, but it DOES have stuff like Activation, lousy table support, crazy 'automatic' font size changing (I set it to 11pt, and it changed to 10pt).Pass on this one unless you, like me, have money to burn!"
3,Stick with what you have.,"I wasn't going to post a review up but I must seriously disagree with the last post. Office is nice, looks pretty, but the price is ridiculous. If you've got Win98SE and an old edition of Office then stick with it and keep your money in your own bank. You worked to hard to just give it away. If you have a different office suite package that does what you want then you'll be alot happier if you treated yourself out for a night of fun instead of buying this. With the price of this software you can have ALOT of fun! I guess this is what a monopoly gets us...inflated prices!!!!"
3,Worth the Money?,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to buy this thing. Let's face it, Office is an outstanding multi-task tool, however complicated it may be. My problem is having to pay so much damn money for it. I have tried Sun's StarOffice, but I found that it's not FULLY compatible with MS programs, especially if the file in question is remotely complicated. I'll bet that I'm like a lot of other people in that I already have so many existing MS Word, EXCEL, PowerPoint, and other Microsoft files that I need to work with, I am kind of forced into buying this program for my new computer.I would have no problem whatsoever switching to another brand if I weren't ""locked in"" to using Microsoft, especially considering the highway robbery. What ever happened to the anti-trust thing?"
1,To expensive for what it is,"I was about to buy this product since its the one I use at the office, but when I looked at the price I did some research first.Why would I buy it, when I can get very similar alternatives for much less like StarOffice? of even for free (OpenOffice). It does have nice features but most of them I have never used. I have been using OpenOffice for the past 3 months and I haven't missed a feature yet. If you are buying this office suite I would recommend you try OpenOffice first, it could save you a lot of money."
3,Why pay $$$ for a new version of Office?,"I mean have you ever used more then a fraction of Office features? When my wordpad at hope stopped to recognize office xp file format (which was not a problem with previous version of the office) I lookd for an alternative and I found one, for free: an application package from openoffice.org. 50 MB file reads md .doc format and doeas it all for free and very well."
3,"Product Great, Turnaround time a little lengthy",Muscle Milk n Oats is one of the best nutrition products out there. My only complaint is that it took two weeks or more to arrive after I ordered.
5,Delicious Food for the Intellect !,"I like the way Cambeira demonstrates a firm understanding of the lexicons of several languages and his ability to transition between languages without confusing the reader. These transitions successfully bridge the cultural gap in communication between the Eurocentric and the African-descended Caribbean culture, especially with the amazing depictions of Caribbean spirituality. Cambeira's writing style, especially his utilization of figurative language, conveys the experience of life in an environment of human exploitation through the eyes of his ""AZUCAR"" and the others characters he created with skillful artistry. Cambeira's Azucar was most surely food for the intellect.Highest Recommendation for this Excellent Novel."
5,Painfully Honest and Wrenching,"This is an author who is adept at understanding and illustrating the complexities and multi-layered dimensions of Caribbean culture. Many of Cambeira's characters are confronted with the challenge of various kinds of resistance. This resistence in one form or another restricts and limits the ways that these characters can define and redefine their lives. With characters like Don Anselmo, Dona Fela, Harold and Marcelo, Estime, and of course Azucar herself, there is a clear sense of historical, social and political awareness and internal development of self. Cambeira's artistry is outstanding in this honest, real and wrenching novel. Congratulations again to the author. I see where another of his works is suggested reading for the stage adaptation of Vargas Llosa's ""Fiesta del Chivo"". Cambeira is a Caribbean writer to definitely watch. I await his next sparkling tale. Very Highly Recommended."
4,Sugar Refined,"In general I liked this book. Cambeira's visual style of writing painted a detailed picture of life in the Caribbean. At times the realism of the story made me uncomfortable, but I think that was the desired effect. The personal conflicts and struggles of the characters in the story reminded me of Arthur Millers ""Death of a salesman"". While the education and development of the Azúcar reminded me of a modern day Edmund Dantes from Alexandre Dumas's ""the Count of Monte Cristo"" as he was educated in the Chteau d'If. I especially liked that the story held a theme similar to many works in literature that emphasizes the importance of liberty and the determination of the human spirit to over come oppression."
5,Wow! You really took me there!,"I can't consume a grain of sugar without thinking about Azucar. This book and a glass of wine was the best date I've had in years. I couldn't put it down. Not only was this book entertaining, it was educating as well. Every chapter took me deeper and deeper until I found myself in the cane field. The writing was so hypnotic that I found myself experiencing everything first hand! And when I thought I had figured it all out, I'm shocked over and over again! Cambeira really took me there. Give me more, Give me more! (I would love to see Erica Badu play Dona Fela)"
5,Shocking Eye-Opener!,This novel by Alan Cambeira is an enormous eye-opener. It is full of intriguing events that keep the reader locked in and wanting more. The characters seem so very real and believable. The action moves in a kind of blurred fashion across time lines from the past and into the present. I thought this was a very skillful way of sustaining the suspense. I thorougly enjoyed this very unusual story.
5,Classic Caribbean Realism,"I have been a reader of Caribbean Literature for a long time. I am originally from Barbados and have read the best of our regional literature: Anglophone, Francophone, Hispanophone. With Cambeira's gripping first novel, the reader wants it to go on endlessly. This is a riveting story. The author offers an eloquent tribute to women's voices everywhere. His characters are truly fascinating and the tale itself captures the Caribbean realism in marvelous fashion. Here is a unique and valuable book. This is the Caribbean novel we have been waiting for. Anybody who is serious about good fiction will surely have this book on her list of Must-Read novels. Cambeira deserves attention."
5,Secret Caribbean Powers,"Maryse Conde gave us Tituba. Now Alan Cambeira gives us Azucar! Here are two epic Caribbean heroines ---like the classic Medea from the pen of the Greek Euripides --- that serve as the symbolic embodiment of revolt and opposition to all forms of oppression (mainly of women) in the Caribbean. Both Tituba and Azucar join together across the ages as victims of violent oppression, but who nevertheless exercise certain secret powers ... but with different results. What a story! It would be ""tres formidable en francais."""
5,AZÚCAR! and Celia Cruz,"You automatically think about our beloved Celia Cruz anytime the word ""azúcar"" pops up! Because that word is her immediately recognized artistic trademark as the Latin diva and legendary songstress sings the seductive rhythms of AfroCuban music. But when I learned about Alan Cambeira's novel with this unusual title, I wanted to read the book right away. And I'm glad I did. This is a powerful novel from every possible angle. I loved this story and all the amazingly dynamic characters in it. The author makes you feel that you are right alongside the characters, experiencing exactly what they do. Cambeira's book reaches out and grabs you. As Celia would yell, AZÚCAR!"
5,Compelling Reading,"I think when writing fiction, a writer has one of her greatest challenges in creating compelling characters that both interest the reader and fit the story. The author here, Alan Cambeira, did a superior job in doing this. The characters in this (for me) most unusual story were so visual that I could feel their pains and their joys. From my perspective, the best aspect of this novel was the feeling I got after I finished it; I felt as though the characters became a part of me. It was extremely difficult to put down this novel once I had begun reading about Azucar's life. I am seriously recommending this book to everybody I know."
5,AZÚCAR is Exquisite Prose...,"What a wonderful narrative... honest and masterfully written! Dr. Cambeira humbly offers me, as a reader, the joy of exploring great virtues thanks to the loved characters of 'el batey'. Love and compassion, strength and honor, faith, endurance and pride... all found in Doña Fela, Don Anselmo, Azúcar and all the other residents of 'el batey'. Reading Azúcar's story made me think of the balance between faith, love, and respect for one another. Bravo for Alan Cambeira...what a talent...what an unforgettable reading experience.Also Recommended: Azucar's Sweet Hope...Her Story Continues, Alan Cambeira's Latest Novel."
2,Let down by bad editing and an unrealistic storyline,"I was very excited when a friend bought me this book from my wish list for Christmas. With all of the excellent reviews on Amazon I couldn't wait to get started. Initially, the book was very good, however, the further I progressed, the harder it got to read. I felt that the book was let down by poor editing as it was full of spelling and typographical errors which were extremely distracting. The deathbed confessions were simply blurted out, almost like the author had to finish the book quickly and the reveal the 'mysteries' - and to be honest, I would have been happier if the book finished there. From hereon in, the storyline became predictable but at the same time ridiculous. The final chapters were particularly weak and simply unbelievable; reminiscent of a trashy cheap novel. I won't be purchasing the rest of the trilogy."
3,Disappointing,"It is obvious that Sr. Cambeira is an expert in the cultural history and development of the Dominican Republic however his overly professorial view of history inhibits his story-telling ability. The story line tries to cover too much ground while leaving the reader completely lost without the safety line of a clear plot and adequate character development. The lack on consistent writing style is unnerving and the lack of depth to the characters leads the reader to disregard the characters as unreal and frivolous.The decision has to be taken by the author if they will present the characters as a novel or as a biography and unfortunately, Sr. Cambeira tried to do both, unsuccessfully in this book."
5,Entertaining,"Writer Cambeira, has a real winner on his hands with his Azucar! The Story Of Sugar. I was truly entertained with his interesting story. The characters, dialogue, and plot, I found most appealing. Nicely done Alan!John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures Inc.Beverly Hills, California"
5,A Promising Author,"Cambeira's story of Azucar is so abundant with luscious detail and description just like the tantalizing tropical setting that I felt I was really there. It was like actually meeting and talking along with Azucar morena, Dona Fela, Don Anselmo, Estime, one-eyed Clementina, the wicked Montalvos, Harold and Marcelo. I learned so much about Caribbean culture and the sugar industry and the mysterious Caribbean spirit world that I never knew before. And how could anybody ever forget the ""batey"" and its unbelievable horrors? Doing some related research, I found Cambeira's name and another of his books listed among suggested readings in a study guide for a stage version of Mario Vargas Llosa's novel La Fiesta Del Chivo (The Feast of the Goat), that I will see soon.My congratulations to this promising author.A Must Read Novel."
5,A Haunting and Passionate Story,"The author presents a deeply haunting story that overflows in passion on every page. This is excellent Caribbean storytelling that contains all the necessary elements for the authentic flavor and texture of this exciting region. The characters draw the reader into their conversations and situations. And the descriptions are mesmerizing and real. Dona Fela and Don Anselmo are the most intriguing fictional individuals since Conde's Tituba and Lovelace's Aldrick. Cambeira includes alot of little known culture and history and spiritual beliefs of the Caribbean.Readers will enjoy with bold story. I recommend this novel very highly.Gracias, compatriota, por tu regalo al mundo literario."
5,Brilliant Writing! A Movie is Waiting to be Made!,"Reading AZUCAR! was a soul-searing experience for me in which I was forced to go back into time to see the origins of plantation life: the horrors, the abuses, the excesses of power, the exploitation, the greed... but also the loves, the joys, those stolen moments of humanity among the workers. At times during the reading I felt certain past traumatic experiences seven times stronger. AZUCAR! exploded out of the author in an outpouring of suppressed hursts that boiled over into an ice-cold rage. Cambeira deserves praise for his dramatic rendering of a difficult subject and brilliant novelistic treatment. I now see the Caribbean differently thanks to this novel ... so unlike any other I have read about the Caribbean. The visual effect is astonishing.A movie has got to be in the making!Very Highly Recommended."
5,The Year Of The Dominicans,"Sammy Sosa, Amelia Vega [the new Miss Universe 2003], Ruperto Vanderpool [the 1st Dominican to do nationwide stand-up comedy in English], Mariela Encarnación [the 1st Dominican female to have her own show on Telemundo network], the films Raising Victor Vargas and Washington Heights and now a dynamic new literary voice in Alan Cambeira! This Dominican author has written a bold, provocative fictionalized account of the ugliness and brutality of the sugarcane industry in the modern day Caribbean. Cambeira tackles a sensitive, but carefully hidden story of the disgraceful mistreatment and exploitation of sugarcane workers. And he certainly knows what he's talking about. He thoroughly convinced me that he was there! What a terrific novel. This is the Year of The Dominicans for sure! I am recommending this novel to everybody I know.ARRIBA LOS DOMINICANOS!!!THANKS CAMBEIRA FOR THIS EXCELLENT NOVEL!!!!"
4,Astley's books always entertain,"This is the 3rd book of Judy Astley's that I have listened to on Audible. I have enjoyed the books and the narrators have been very entertaining with attractive voices. The thing that bothers me about Judy Astley's books is that a lot of the main characters, women, seem to let things happen to them. This book is disappointing in that the main character seems to have a lax attitude about her marriage - A simple contented, but doing nothing about it sort of attitude and when something goes wrong she doesn't get outwardly angry or demand her pound of flesh. I guess the character is kind of emotionally passive which bugs me to no end. Saying all that it is still highly entertaining with dry humor and funny situations. Quirky British island life."
5,What a joy!,"This book was just wonderful. Being a Celt by blood, I was inspired by these wonderful works included in this collection. I hope that there will be more of this kind of compilations that will continue to come out."
3,"Okay, but a bit too small.","I ordered the correct pad, but they seem to have made it perhaps one half inch shorter in dimension. Otherwise it appears to be equal to the original pad, and it works just fine."
5,Good card for a great price.,Bought this for my Canon HG10 camcorder. The read and write speed isn't the best but more than satisfies the need for casual picture taking with the HG10. I'd recommend this if you need a mini-sd card and you're looking on a budget.
1,2GB Mini SD Card,"I received the card very promtly and the customer service was fantastic! Unfirtunately, the card did not fit my cell phone, even though it was a Mini SD Card."
5,Great product - Awesome Price,This 2 GB mini SD card was less than a 1GB card at the store and has functioned perfectly for the past month. It arrived within a week and is one of the best deals I have found online.
1,AutoXray EZ-Read 2000- Did not like it.,"You can get a code reader cheaper than this one. A lot of the functions on the unit like 'MON' and 'DATA' buttons require an upgrade for $99. The unit did not come with cable to link it to a computer to do the upgrade, you also have to purchase that.K. Telfah"
5,"It's a remake, and a rather good one at that","Regarding the previous review, this CD is not by a different group but rather contains a remake of a few of their hits for DOOTONE as well as some aditonal material recorded for Mercury."
2,"Helpful, but not that helpful","The case briefs are subpar and the software is worse. The skeletal summaries of each case aren't that helpful, and more detail and analysis is found in competitor's briefs. The real downside of the software, however, is that it is very clumsy and difficult to use. You can't always copy/paste between the e-Legalines program and whatever other program you usually use for notes. Formatting options are terrible and the search isn't as useful as searching in other programs.It isn't all bad. For example, it is nice to have the software which you can use in class and have with you without another book on your back. And although skeletal, the case briefs do give you a basic idea of what you need to know."
3,This is NOT 15-30-15,I ordered this from a google search for Miracle Gro 15-30-15 and they linked to Amazon and this product which you will find has DIFFERENT numbers when they send it!
3,"Great product, but too expensive than HomeDepot price","Great product, but too expensive than HomeDepot price of $18+ tax, i would give 5 star for product but because of price it's 3 star"
5,Great price for a good product,"Bought this last year for my lawn and garden, still have about half of it, which makes it a real bargain. It is easy to use with the sprayer (which we already owned) and seemed to make our flowers healthier."
2,Doesn't really work as a movie,"I think Dave Barry's writing is akin to stand-up comedy. His flow, pacing, ""delivery"", and choice of material fits with the concept of a comedian on stage, giving a show with nothing but a microphone. His books are almost all based on the idea of picking a topic, then making lists of sub-topics, and cracking jokes about them. So to translate this into movie form required that the material be augmented and sometimes significantly changed. The writer of the movie had two choices I think. He could have turned it into a kind of sketch-comedy show, with a series of sketches but no attempt to connect them. The second choice, which he took, was to try to architect a flow more akin to a tradition scripted comedic story. I just don't think it worked. Maybe if it had a screenwriter with talent equal to Dave, it could have worked.So basically, some of it was funny, but more often it was just dumb, and the ""flow"" was awkward. I say, read his book, and skip this movie."
4,JOhn,Easy to use and compared readings at the Doctor's office. The numbers were very close. Very satisfied with product.
5,Easy to use........,This cuff is real easy to slip on and off. It's great that it covers all the sizes. I am very pleased with this unit. Glad I bought it. Have checked it against a manual cuff and seems to be consistent.
3,Big device,"The device is large and bulky. Not good for travel- too big. Has multiple modes and features, but relatively complex to learn to use. Works well if you take the time to learn to use it."
1,Cuff problem,"I am a slender woman 115lbs., the spring cuff is difficult to hold tightly enough to secure a fit capable of reading my blood pressure taking it on my own. IT IS A STRUGGLE TO TAKE ON MY OWN, the loose cuff is the only way for me to secure a tight enough fit to take my blood preesure, not this SPRING CUFF. Seriously, for all you single slim people this is not the cuff for you & I have tried to find the old model cuff for this model unit & CANNOT; I do not think they make a different cuff for this unit. One might as well throw the $100 & some $'s away if one is a small individual. Your blood pressure will only increase while attempting to take!"
4,Works well.,"This blood pressure monitor is easy to use. I haven't had it long but it seems to be well made. It fits comfortibly and gives you a reading quickly. It is far superior to the wrist type unit I also have. Two very minor concerns. The battery compartment is not very secure. If the unit drops or is hit sharpely on the table, the batteries tumble out. Also, there is no way to disable the buttons. I packed it in my suitcase, in the storage case. Pressure on the button caused it to start taking a reading. Had to remove the batteries. All-in-all I would recommend it though."
1,Omron HEM-780,"Unit arrived and would not take my blood pressure. It was represented as being made in Japan but had a ""Made in China label"". I would not have ordered it at all if I had known this in advance."
1,Amazon sells used products as new items,"Do not buy from Amazon. I got the product yesterday and when I opened the package, the instrument had scratches and clearly an used item. When I called the customer service, they did not care about sending an used item and finally I have to return the product. Amazon is shipping the used product for the second time (once for the Plantronics Voyager 510 bluetooth headset). I cancelled my Amazon Prime membership but they deducted the $20 from membership fee. Beware if you buy any product from Amazon."
1,The machine is totally inaccurate!,"I bought this machine at my local supermarket pharmacy. Before I left I knew I wanted to test it so I tried the supermarket bp kit (where you sit down at a table and the cush inflates and reads for you). My pressure was 146/90 and my heart rate was 90high for me - I'm usually lower in bp and my heart rate has a hard time pushing 60. But I was stressed. I asked if I could try the Omron HEM-780 and used the adapter plugged into a socket by one of the tables in the store. It was within 5 minutes of the testing from the store's machine. The Omnron read me at 118/70 with a heart rate of 72. Wrong! I got back up and went right back over to the machine, and again I got 143/88 and this time the pulse was 92.......One more time I tried the Omron on my right arm (afer following the instructions for right arm fitting) and this time it said 123/88 pulse 67. So off! I didn't even bother to cart it out the store!"
3,Blood pressure monitor,"The monitor seems to work o.k., but the instructionslack a bit. It has features that are not fully explained,like how to get the history of person A or person B or how to lookat yesterdays reading, or two days ago. It appears to hold record by the weekand somehow it infers thatnthey are averaged.. Not sure,As you might see it's a bit of a mystery.We could have purchase a much simpler unit for less money."
4,High Blood Pressure Monitor,"I am very pleased with the Omron BP HEM780 monitor that I purchased. Easy to read and easy to use. Checked it out with my doctor for accuracy and it was accurate. The only con (and not a big one) is that putting it on takes a little getting use to; but if you do not do it properly, it lets you know it with symbols on the machine so you try it again."
4,Good quality,"I feel this blood pressure monitor is good enough for blood pressure measuring especially for olders. But I think it would be better if it has more functions than as at present. Anyway, it is a good gift for parents who want to keep measuring these body parameters and make themselves safe from high blood pressure and diseases."
4,Blood Pessure at home,This product was recommended by my doctor. It arrived and I found it easy to use and have checked its accuracy with my nurse several times and found it very true. I would recommend it for anyone needing frequent tests of blood pressure.
5,Just what the Doctor ordered,"I researched several sites before making the decision to purchase the OMRON blood pressure monitor through Amazon. Amazon offered the best price. Other sites offered the same product for twice as much as what I paid here.The instructions that came with the monitor are easy to follow, and in no time I had the unit set up. Using this monitor is very easy and I've been pleased with my purchase."
5,BP Monitor,Have used omron before and was very satisfied. Wish you could print out results but know they don't make those anymore. Especially like the way the cuff is - easier to manipulate and feel getting more accurate reading from machine.
3,Not user friendly,"This machine produces a lot of readings that end with ""errors"". When you can get a good reading, it is very accurate, but overall the machine is very difficult to use properly. It is certainly not user friendly for a non-medical person."
3,Maybe fewer options would be better,"Product is larger than I thought -- kind of bulky compared to my previous monitors. Some of that is due to features available. While I eventually set it up to do what I wanted, it required careful and repeated use of the manual -- not intuitive. My 89-year old Mom has even more trouble.Cuff is not the easiest to place on your upper arm. More than 50% of time get error message and have to adjust.Good to have adapter for power, but cord is short enough it is somewhat of a nuisance."
4,Performs as stated,"This seems to be a nice machine that performs as advertised. The cuff is easy to position, and I like the fact that it came with both batteries and an AC adapter. It has some pretty sophisticated memory functions that are a bit difficult to understand/operate without the instruction book in front of you. The controls to operate it are very simple, but the memory features are not intuitive. Overall a good bargain and very nice machine."
5,Perfect!,"My husband gets anxious about going to the doctor's office so when he does go, his blood pressure usually records higher than it usually is. My husband's doctor has been recommending that he get a blood pressure monitor so that he can record his ""normal"" rhythm of blood pressure readings and then guage his medication according to that as opposed to his ""spiked"" blood pressure readings at the office. We have been hesitant because of the cost of the monitors we had seen. Then this Christmas, we saw this one through Amazon at such a reasonable cost, we couldn't resist. The detailed description (we were able to order the extra large cuff model); ease of comparing models and features before we ordered along with the excellent prices was exactly what we needed. Thanks Amazon!"
1,would not purchase again,I have found this cuff to be very difficult to put on properly causing device to give to many errors
4,good,"its very easy to use, it was for my grandfather and its so easy to use even he can use it for himself. very nice."
3,Awkward,The cuff is awkward and difficult to use if you have thin arms. The unit also consistently reads pulse rate significantly higher than actual.The blood pressure measurements are consistent with those I receive during a physician office visit.
4,Quick and Easy,"This blood pressure monitor is quick and easy. I don't have to guess how high I need to go with a bulb pressure unit. The cuff fits my upper arm which exceeds ""normal"" cuff measurements. It is comfortable and partially permanent formed so it grips your arm while you are wrapping the rest of the cuff around your arm which makes it very easy to put on.Has a memory which makes it easy for me to keep a record for my docotor. I even bought one for my sister..."
