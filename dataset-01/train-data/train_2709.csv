3,"just ""okay""","I thought this book was just ""okay."" I read a lot of true crime and enjoy stories that delve into the personalities of the people involved. I did not find this book did that to the extent I would have liked. I never really understood Jane. It's difficult to believe anyone could be as naive as she appears to have been."
4,skin,"Written under the pressure-cooker conditions of the three-day novel contest,Bonnie Bowman has come up with a funny, twisted book which I thoroughly enjoyed. Focusing on the sexually frustrated (even tormented) Dr. Swan, who suffers from a""deformity"" most men would give their eyeteeth to share, skin is by turns funny, erotic, disgusting. Mainly the story of Dr. Swan's relationship with his porn-star patient Cynthia Poole,skin has some very well-rendered and humorous flashbacks and set-pieces. A light and easy though well-written short novel, I don't hesitate to recommend it."
5,WILD WITCHES DON'T GET THE BLUES,"What I like to do is compare books on Wicca and see what examples they have in common with other writers of Astrology, Ritual,and Healing, type of books.I beleive this book is more down to earth than most other books I have read on Wicca."
1,Fatally flawed and worthless,"This book could be informative and interesting, except for two things:1. The information in it is available in many other volumes, much more easily available.2. The book is marred by man-hating sentiment and is utterly lacking in balance. According to this book, men only want to rape and beat and control women, and only want to be Christians, and any man who claims to be a pagan is only doing so to get to women so he can rape and beat and control them. Lesbian love is presented as ""the only true love that can exist."" There's other examples of stuff that can only be called hate speech directed against the entire male sex; funny coming from people who claim to have peace and love in their hearts."
4,Dog loves em,Taste wise my dog thinks these tabs are a treat... she goes nuts when i pick up the bottle and runs into the room when she hears me shake the container.. Other then that i cannot tell you or anyone if they are good for any animal. I dont know what is in them or if they make any kind of difference or impact in my dogs life. Blind faith i guess that they do help. Got a german shepherd and the hips go at the end. just trying to starve off that terrible affliction.
4,My dogs love them.,Unsure cannot tell any difference? Note only 4 stars because well how would you rate? They should have a spot for this. Both my dogs love taste that's the only thing I'm sure about.
1,Beware!,"Please be careful! The contents of these vitamins are inaccurate and potentially dangerous. Check out consumerLabs.com and see what they have to say about this particular brand of pet vitamin. I would give zero stars if I could. I have nothing against the seller, the item arrive on time and packaged well. However, I cannot recommend this product.[...]"
3,Birds won't use them,My birds won't go anywhere near these. They are perch sleepers. Make sure your birds like to go inside of things before buying these. I've wasted so much money buying them stuff that they don't use. They don't even play with their toys. The prefer to play with trash like junk mail paper and paper towel rolls.
3,Happy Hut Hideaway by Multipet Green - Medium,"It's good if you want to give your bird something else to poop on, otherwise it served no purpose.... ;)"
1,Very disappointed,"I was really excited to get this telescope, having spent years using my old, manual one. The first night I took it out, the motor didn't work correctly. The telescope would move left and right and down, but wouldn't move up. I thought maybe it was just rather stiff because it was new, but after several more attempts, it still doesn't move up. Without the motor working, the telescope is impossible to align correctly, which makes the computerized viewing list of stars and what not worthless. I am returning it and thinking that I will purchase another brand of telescope next time."
1,Celestron's lack of customer support,"I don't know how good the telescope is. I bought it for, and had it shipped to, my son who lives in Colorado. He had a problem with closing the battery compartment after the batteries are inserted. He sent an email to Celestron and it was never answered. He tried calling them (long distance, no 800 number) and they didn't answer their telephone within 25 minutes.As I said, I can't rate the telescope, but Celestron gets only one star."
1,Buyer Beware,Just unpacked this last night. Did not work. Called tech support thismorning and that was no help. There only suggestion was to send it back to them. I guess I did not do a thorough a job of researching as I thought I did. My bust.
5,Very Nice Telescope,"I heard great things of Celestron products, and this was dissappointment. This thing does it all! Computerized movement, easy to use keypad. A really nice telescope."
3,"Decent scope, needs upgrades.","The construction of this telescope leaves a lot to desire. The battery case cap pops off, the telescope seems a little too fragile and it shakes while looking through it. The optics it comes with are not powerful at all (even though its advertised by celestron as deep-space capable). With the 9 and 25mm eyepieces it comes with you are not gonna get that far so you need to get better eyepieces. If you decide to get this scope get the AC adapter too. The motorized mount will kill you batteries after a short while of use."
5,Love this lens! Very affordable and versatile.,"Slight distortion on the sides, but expected for this kind of lens. Very impressive and allows you to get widers shots in doors or outdoors."
3,"Shogi? No, this is Janggi.",I found this while searching for a cheap shogi set. If you look at the picture this is not shogi. It is janggi. Janggi is the Korean variant of chess and is similar to xiangqi.
1,Out of Date,"I am writing this February, 2001. The book was written in 1998. It has a calendar and tide charts that would have been nice, perhaps even useful in 1998, but are now worthless. The book also contains ""over $250 in savings"" coupons that expired over two years ago.It remains to be seen if the featured attractions, restaurants and businesses are still operating. I will check it out this summer.I recommend a pass on this item. Look for something more current."
3,Entertaining,"My honest opinion is that this isn't the work to seek out if you're a literature critic who cannot stomach anything less amazing and breath-taking than Shakespeare. This is meant to be light reading. Some of what was included was strong, and most of it was ok. All said, I'd say it was mediocre. You won't hate yourself for reading it, and you won't necessarily wonder why Columbia Pictures hasn't snapped up the movie rights. I did see potential in some of the writing which may grow with practice and maturation."
5,good book,"This is an awesome book! The collection is full of stories that are real suspenseful or super terrifying! There were ghost stories, serial killers, psychics, demons--everything to make a good book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspenseful short story--novella length writings.A+"
4,good accuracy on most cards,"i was very pleased with how the 800c performed. by and large it is quite accurate. it does have challenges with very creative card designs, so people in advertising and design, like me, need to have realistic expectations. but it takes about 90% of the effort out of the process. 130 cards took me about 45 minutes to scan and verify content. give it a try."
1,As Fast To Enter Manually - A Lot Cheaper,"This thing never worked that well to begin with, but it was kind of cool to have a card image occasionally. As other reviewers have noted, you still have to carefully look at the card and compare it to the data and something will need to be added or corrected on nearly every card. The last straw though was my long ""chat"" with Tech Support when in the end they wanted $120 for new software to run with Win7. No way. It was never worth $120 to begin with. In the end, manually entering the data is faster."
3,"Executive CardScan Review - Nice, but NOT Highly Accurate","I would have thought by now that current OCR software would make reading business cards fairly accurate and reliable. I am the President of a company and expect to be able to quickly enter business cards without having to spend a lot of time reviewing for accuracy. However, I have to make modifications to scanned cards about 50% of the time which arguably defeats having the device. A quick typist could enter just as fast.My recommendation is that if you are quick on the keyboard, this is not a great investment unless you can afford to waste the money. If you are slow at data entry, this probably will save time over the course of a 100 or so cards.More time or money needs to be spent on improving the OCR software. When they can reliably obtain 80% or more accuracy, I would more favorably endorse."
4,Worth Your Investment,"Fantastic. Saves many hours and gives peace of mind. Very accurate but not 100% perfect. Compact, light, attractive, simple to use. The included software and website backup is worth the purchase. The best one on the market."
1,Lost All My Contacts,"This is the worst electronic product I've ever bought in my life.After buying the product, I scanned all my 200 business cards and throw them away. It went on to lost all my contacts within a week.I have not been using for about 3 months (since it is not usable) and my cards begin to pile up again. I thought I should reinstall the software and give it another chance. I tried to download the driver from their website, I was taken through the registration process, promising at the end I will get the driver. Instead, I was shown a broken page after I went through the registration and provided all my information.It is an incredible horrible company in terms of products and services. All it has given me is grief."
1,Great (if it worked longer).,"This is a great product from a functionality perspective, but really poor quality. The first unit I had worked for about 2 weeks, and then crashed. It took days to get someone on the phone, but when I did, they were great, and sent a replacement unit right away.That one lasted for 3 days before it had the same problem as the first one (gets stuck in continuous feed mode without recognizing cards).When it worked, it was great - very little editing needed - and good synchronization software - and obviously some folks have no problems - but the quality of the scanner unit itself is just very inconsistent. I just can't recommend it..."
5,Works Brilliantly!,"My boss plopped this machine on my desk last week. He has boxes and boxes of business cards. It has worked amazingly. Really fast scanning (all color). The software picks up everything- sometimes it mis-categorizes data, but the software allows you to drag and drop, and right click copy and paste, so it is really quick to move data around. 85% of cards are perfect the first time. Highly recommend."
5,CardScan,The product is easy and very fast. It's great to eliminate all the business cards. I wished I got one a lot sooner.
2,Cardscan WAS great until Dynmo bought them,"I bought the Cardscan V7 a year ago, now I tried to buy upgrade parts. the Dynmo web site is so poor, they do not service it at all. Customer support and feedback is an afterthought.I bought the Blackberry connector so that my scanned cards would go into my Blackberry directly without Outlook. The web site crashed many times trying to even look at the product, then after my trying 10 different routes to buy it, it finally allowed me to view the product for sale.once I bought it, it had no serial number and here 3 days later, there is still no serial number for the software. I cannot use it or install it.IMHO Dynamo bought a good product and company and is driving it into a poor product. they use the normal redirect all customer support to a user forum rather than answer their own problems. Buy at your own risk, as they will drop you on the floor flat the day after they have your money."
1,Buy a Cardscan product only if you want to waste your time and money.,"Actually zero stars.I've bought hundreds of items off of Amazon since the site began and have never written a revue until now. This has to rank as the most disappointing and frustrating product I've ever purchased.I had the scanner for a week and scanned less than 20 cards before it broke down. It stopped capturing card data and syncing with the software but the motor on the scanner would run incessantly. The only way to make it stop was to go into the task manager and shut down the software.I tried updating the software, reinstalling it on my computer and reinstalling it on a new computer.Tech support is as terrible as the other reviews state. I was on hold for 48 min before they picked up and then the tech was frazzled, rude and ultimately unhelpful.After wasting $200 and several hours I'm cutting my losses, tossing it in the trash and starting over."
1,Refurbished doesn't work.,I purchased 2 different CardScan packages from Tech for Less. Neither one of the refurbished scanners worked. Now I'm leary about purchasing a new scanner.
1,product deserve be in a trash can and the technical support does not exist,"this product does not support 64 bit Windows, the Customer NON service is HORRIBLE...try something else not this scanner it does not work"
1,not worth the price.,"This product was a disapointment for me. I found the writing style confusing and unprofessional. More than half of the info in the book is taken directly from the FAA. I could have found this info on my own probably for free on the internet. The book itself is a photocopied booklet, physically not what I expected for the price."
2,Banish Fear of Flying,"I found that this pamplet did not provide anything more than basic information. The author only acknowledges that it is reasonable to be fearful. I would not recommend this to anyone who has ever flown or who is looking for a solution to their problem, you will not learn anything new."
4,A Solid Dragon Set,"The main reason why I purchased this set was because of the red dragon. There are very few red dragons released in the Dragons building toy lines and it's bright color drew me in. I had no idea that the toy was encased in a metal tin, which is a terrific convenience for storage.Many of the other pieces are repaints from previous Dragons collections, but I had never been able to purchase them in time because Mega Bloks only has one production run of any set. The arches and staircase really make this piece stand out viewing from the front, but the back is really forgetable. The catapult as a siege weapon and the bonus winged beast (at the moment I cannot remember what they are called) were nice touches.Over all I would say that it would be a fabulous starter set for anyone getting into Dragons."
5,"DOOD , IT'S SOUTH PARK POKER , SWWEEEETTTTT!!!!","THIS IS MY FAVORITE POKER SET ( OKAY ... IT'S ACTUALLY MY ONLY POKER SET DOOD !!! .) THIS IS HELLA COOL BECAUSE , LIKE , ALL YOUR FAVORITE SOUTH PARK CHARACTER'S ARE HERE . AND IT'S EDUTAINMENT TOO DUDE BECAUSE EVERY KID NEED''S TO LEARN HOW TO BLUFF AND STUFF , RIGHT ??? IT'S LIKE THE COOLEST THING SINCE CARTMAN WENT TO CASA BONITA , OOOKKAAAYYY !!!"
3,Has pros and Cons,"Pros- Its good, Strong bag, Can be used roughly and carries a lot of stuff..Cons- not much sections in bag where you can place stuff which is needed frequently. Eg. i travel by train so i keep my monthly pass in the bag . I expected an easy to access section where i can keep the pass. Side pockets are good but not that useful.Overall. A good decent bag .. am happy with my purchase .."
2,"FALSE ADVERTISING - 17"" powerbook owners beware","If you have an Apple Powerbook 17"", DO NOT BUY THIS BACKPACK.Although the product is nicely made and attractive, especially for the price, the notebook compartment is padded on the sides and bottom, but not on top. There is only an elastic band on top that holds the laptop in place.Although the manufacturer's description says that this backpack can hold a 17"" powerbook, I suppose it would fit -- but the top of the notebook would be against the edge of the laptop and UNPADDED. If you care about avoiding dents in your powerbook, do not order this.On the other hand, if you have a 15"" laptop and don't need a really-well insulated notebook compartment, I would recommend this bag. 16"" is just borderline. It has a comfy gel padding on the back and a sporty look."
3,Okay Loppers,"These are okay loppers, but not great and not as good as the ""Fiskars 15-Inch PowerGear Anvil Lopper 7972"" loppers. I don't understand the difference, but these have trouble cutting compared to the 7972 and I will not be buying these again."
3,Just Make Your Own,"I thought for the price this drummer's rug would've been something more than it is. All it is a piece of thin carpet with a 2 x 4 rolled in the end and stapled shut. I haven't tried it yet, but if I really like it I'll update my post. I wouldn't recommend this product for this price."
1,Interesting but misleading. Don't buy.,"This book is mistitled. It should be called ""Gypsy-Flavored Wicca"". Wicca, of course, never existed before Gardner. While Wicca incorporates some older practices, it is not identical with them. If you call this Gypsy Magic, you may as well say that Catholicism is the same as Paganism, and that Tibetan Buddhism is the same as Hinduism."
4,"Good, well-written book","As a fan of Regency romances, I enjoyed this book. It is well-written, with well-developed characters and a spunky, lively, likeable heroine. I also appreciated the fact that it is the first novel of its genre that I have read that contains the observance of Guy Fawkes Night. However, although I liked hero Geoffrey's fun-loving, romantic side, I did not find him particularly respectable. He humiliated his rival at the Fawkes celebration and employed dirty, ungentlemanly tactics during their fistfight. However, I can understand why the two main characters fell in love. I look forward to reading more of Regina Scott's work."
4,Perfect Squeal to the 12 Days of Christmas,"This is book two in a series, I would highly recommend reading The 12 days of Christmas first. It is a great book stand alone, but is an excellent book if you read in order. That is the only reason why I gave it four stars. As always, Regina Scott has a well developed story and beautiful romance. I am reading the third book now, The Marquis Kiss."
5,THE book for real Web developers who care about business,"If you have already been through the unspeakable pains of a web client relationship gone awry, you will appreciate like never before the words of wisdom present on this book. In fact you would probably not need any other book in the field. Web project management is more than a head for numbers or the gathering of technical expertise: It is about business, and good-conducted business at that. If you know how to handle client demands right and structure your workflow efficiently, things will be much easier. Siegel's book encapsulates all of this neccesary knowledge. Go ahead, press that ""add to cart"" button."
3,Visually exiciting! Creative heavyweight. A must NOT have.,"The book reads like a daily guide on the interaction of creatives to arrive at a solution. Granted they are good at what they do, but who needs to know if ""project management requires phone time"". The book easily loses its audience's attention by taking itself too serious-- publishing thumbnail sketches--really now. I don't want to travel that deep into the ARTIST's brain fellas. The book was good looking, visually stunning, well organized, superbly documented, but the ""bathing suit (content) was too tight for the beach"". Leave the beauty at the store, go for the shade of a good book not just fluff."
1,Pretentious waste of time,"... This book is aimed at graphic designers, marketing agencies and the like who put together nice marketing oriented sites, whose sole job is marketing the company. For people such as myself who implement lage scale ebusiness websites, intranets, corporate portals etc there is nothing. The concept of dynakic database driven sites isn't even mentioned.These projects are a cross between an IT project (with all the traditional skills and techniques that implies) and a maketing project (such as a TV campaign). There are multiple wildly different and largely incompatibel skillsets at work and these have to be welded together to promoite efficiency, while not destroying the motivation and qualities of the diverse people involved.Traditional IT managemnt skills have to blend with the world of the graphic designer and the business analyst. This book doesn't even start to cover that. An utter waste of time.Added to this I personally find david siegel's designs immensely overrated."
2,Very introductory,This book will be helpful to you only if you need a basic introduction to the business of Web development. It's also fairly outdated advice!
4,Great lessons learned,This book is great for its lessons learned with the projects discussed in the first part. The second part on project management contains less new information for anyone who has any project management experience.
4,A nice guideline for project managers,This book gives a clear overview of the different steps in a project cycle. What's even more important it warns you for possible pitfalls and adds some tips to avoid these. A well written book that gives a complete general picture of site building.
5,An important book for web site designers/clients,"David Siegel's new book provides timely and importantinformation regarding the web site creation process and both thedesigner's and client's role in all of this. As a publishing/book designer of twenty years I am now beginning to apply some of my skills to this new medium. The third generation concept should make this possible. I wish I had had this information/David's thoughts a year ago. David offers a lot of things to think about, some pitfalls to avoid, and some concrete ways of helping the process."
5,Concise,"A concise no-frills to-the-point handbook. Immediately applicable, and which I cannot be without!"
2,Too Many Case Studies,"Secrets of Successful Web Sites is a great resource if you want Case Study after Case Study with very little content ascribed to Project Management. Pages 161 and beyond contained the only worthwhile content for Project Managers.Secrets lacked back-end integration processes, discussions on powerful web apps like BroadVision and Vignette and was fundamentally positioned for Web Agency types like US Web and agency.com. It lacked serious discussion on the technology and the Project Management methodologies could have been expanded on, instead of wasting 161 pages of case study narratives. I did, however, like the fact that the author included the client in the chapters.I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in what the competition is doing and not in how to Project Manage a web development project with serious integration and legacy build applications."
1,For Those Interested in Web Site Design Only,If you are looking for a Methodology for managing the successful development of an ecommerce project in the 21st century then keep looking. This 1997 edition addresses only the front end graphic aspects of web site development.
1,Please! This has nothing to do with creating USEFUL sites!,"I bought this book based on the dozens of accolades here at Amazon.com. What a joke this book is! The thing is UNREADABLE. It is as if a graphic designer simply was let loose. It is impossible to follow the narrative and get at the ""project management on the world wide web"" part that the title promises. I really don't care that this web designer nearly had a heart attack when their ISP was down and Bill Gates was going to introduce IE 3.0 using it, in front of thousands. This is more of a scrapbook of a cadre of overly proud graphic designers. This book needs a major rewrite if it is to become useful and provide guidance to building USEFUL websites"
1,A JEWISH HOMO,"I couldnt even read a page money wasted , these people should be prohibited from holding even a pen ripping of readers like this its unbelievable"
3,For web comapnies,"This book is targeted to little web design companies or people who do big web sites. Very useful for that audience. It's of little use to anyone else.It has useful info for designing ""commercial type"" web sites"
5,"Buy this book, before you make even bigger mistakes.","This book is great. The case studies are helpful, but what happens afterwards is worth it's weight in gold. If you're an old advertising dinosaur, who thinks he knows everything about everything, and that you can move seemlessly into the Internet business, think again, buy this book, before you make a really big mistake."
1,not sure of the unit,"The concersion bar seems extremely flimsy compared to other models on the market, does not seem sturdy enough for long distance. The telescopic tubes should have stopper so that they would not disassemble during installation on the bike. The conversion bar is extremely awkward to install with the bolting type mechanism."
1,Disappointment,I purchased this item from the Amazon description saying that it would run on Windows 95. When it arrived the product was listed as Windows 98 and upwards. I had to return it. Not good!
1,Please Don't Buy This CD !,"The only reason I bought this program was because the American Greetings CreataCard Gold CD that I've have been using was so impossible to use with kiddy layout that I gave up using it. So, I bought the Hallmark CardStudio3 thinking it would be better ... but would you know it has the same kiddy layout that's even worse yet. They had to use the software developers for this program!"
1,Locks up computer,I have a PII 350 128MB memory 20GB hard drive 8 MB AGP videocard computer. The graphics are beautiful but this program locks up sometimes and the little balloon won't move. This the second Hallmark program I've purchased and the same problem exists. My other program was Card Studio Deluxe. Frustrating! I just purchased Hallmark scrapbook and this program needs some help also.
4,excellent,"I opened this program, installed it and printed the first card within 10 minutes. Love it!!"
2,Greeting Card Program,I have had previous versions of Hallmark Studios and liked them much better. My old files did not convert to the new program so I lost my saved cards. There were not that many new features. I will not buy the next version.
3,An OK scanner for an OK price,"The scanner is a little noisy. The software leaves a little to be desired. Your settings are not remembered between scans. Overall, it is a good scanner for the money and the scan quality is very good on prints."
3,HP Scanjet G3010 Photo Scanner,"It took me 3 weeks to figure out how to get it to work with my Windows XP. The directions said to install the software, then hook up the scanner to the computer. Didn't work, and I couldn't find any online help from HP. I finally decided to uninstall it (again, for about the 6th time), and then hook up the scanner to the computer first, then install the software, and it finally worked. Installing the scanner first prompted some other software already on my computer to install the hardware, which it didn't do by installing the software first. Does a nice job of scanning and editing, except no print-preview when selecting copy."
1,Performance just isn't good,"I have used scanners for years. This item is the worst, I'm afraid.It is my first and last HP scanner. I don't know if I can even return it. after 3 months, I have barely been able to use it once. I have a vista computer. I installed and re-installed the software 3 times. I downloaded the latest drivers. I got online with HP Tech for 2 hours and nothing.I now have a paperweight."
3,1st Scanner,"As an artist I purchased the ScanJet to scan my art slides. In order to get nice definition I have to set the pixels at 600 and it takes FOREVER to scan one slide. It is going to take an ETERNITY for me to scan hundreds of slides. However, the scanned slides I've done so far are beautiful."
2,Very Disapointed,I recently received this item from Amazon in brand new condition. After setting it up I cleaned the inside of the glass to remove the dust inside. After cleaning twice I realized there was a two inch smudge across the top of the entire scanner and it wouldn't come off. This is because this smudge along with a couple bits of dust are on the inside of the scanner and can't be cleaned. After searching HP's webiste and attempting to email them (after taking a couple minutes to fill out an online form I got a response back saying they were haveing technical difficulty with their mail system) and searching the web I couldn't find an answer to this situation. The scans are great and it has a lot of good features but when I get dust spots and smudges from a brand new scanner through no fault of my own I am very disapointed.
3,Wish this worked,"I'm sure this is probably a really good scanner IF IT WORKED WITH WINDOWS VISTA. I had a prior HP model and I loved it. I was very disappointed when I ordered this scanner and it said it was certified for Windows Vista and YET IT DIDN'T WORK. After many hours on the phone with HP they basically said ""Send it back"" because it just doesn't work with Windows Vista. My review is not to shed a bad light on an HP product...this is definitely a MICROSOFT ISSUE!!! Hope this helps someone before they go and order it and have to return it like I did."
1,HP Scanner,"After entering program, could not use because it could not be initialized so after several hours of total frustration including time with an HP agent, sent it bak for refund. not a friendly scanner. aare they all like this?"
1,"Unreliable, slow, unreliable, user-unfriendly and unreliable","This is a dud scanner and should never have been made.Constant communication problems and a mind of its own led me to spend hours and hours over several weeks trying to get this scanner to simply work and, on the odd occasion when it did, do the same thing two times in a row. No luck there.Many software re-installs and checking of everything even down to checking power supply voltages and trying on different computers led me to simply put this crud heap in the bin and wave it goodbye.The seller sold it as a 'non-returnable item' and I kick myself for not asking myself why this was. Avoid."
4,"Grim, glossy and witty","Exotic, bitter concept album.Songs by and about men. Wickedly atmospheric, a sensual study of pain, frailty and brutality. Often funny, too.Sparse and swirling, channeling country-rock, psychedelia and electronics, with some incisive rhythms. Sally delivers an unnervingly intimate and intense vocal, an etched, slithering purr coiled viciously tight.Severe but empathetic."
1,Not so universal,"The reason I bought this fin comb is because its description said it would work for any A/C unit, i.e. that it was universal. However, this comb actually further damaged my a/c unit. Bottom line, not universal--the metal wires were too thick to comb out the fins on my a/c unit and just further bent them. I believe that the fin count on my unit is somewhere between 25 and 30 fins per square inch. Also the company I bought this from on Amazon said they would give me a refund for this misleading part, but has never actually given me a refund. That company was the Appliance Care Store."
4,Good Way to straighten lightly bent fins,"I own a carrier heat pump with 25 fins per inch, most standard fin combs do not support that spacing. In using this comb I found it does a reasonable job straightening lightly bent fins but can make a mess of things for really bent combs. I recommend if you are straitening mashed fins that you also obtain a pair of fin pliers to pry up the fin before running this comb over it. Also don't expect to fix mashed fins quickly. I spent a day on a large section and I still have more work to do. This is a very manual process but I already see the improvement in the performance of my heat pump. I noticed my heat pump is now drawling 0.3KW less energy so I plan on further working with the fins to get better air flow."
2,Didn't work too well for me.,"My AC has tiny little fins, about 20 per inch, and I got this to avoid having to pull the AC out to measure it to find out that fact. Sadly, I think this product did more damage than good, having mauled the fins even worse. This might work for larger fins, but I urge care using it on little ones."
1,doesn't get the job done,I purchased this product to straighten the coil fins on a heat pump. It does not work and I would give it Zero stars if possible
4,HFC .25 Semi Auto Pistol...,"My friend has this gun and we all call it the ""faggot"" gun 'cause it only holds one shot after he broke the magazine. However, good backup gun; decent accuracy, awesome power. Overall, it't pretty cool."
4,Another Deadly CD for the collection,"As a ""die""-hard Deadbolt fan, the guys do not disappoint with their latest CD. I Should Have Killed You. From the opening self titled track, right away you know its Deadbolt. Again, not a song goes by that I don't enjoy... some highlight... Telephone the Dead, Tell Me Where He Lies, but my FAVORITE is the bands rendition of Big John... their added verses at the end are Deadbolt through and through! Of course not suited for all audiences and my only disappointment was no reference to Patches the Clown?"
2,"As Deadbolt albums go, this one blows.","""Die-hard"" Deadbolt fan or not, this one blows when compared to the other Deadbolt albums. The only thing ""deadly"" about it is the hit you're wallet will take.If this is your first Deadbolt album, go buy a different one: Tiki Man, Tijuana Hit Squad, Voodoo Trucker, Zulu Death Mask, even Hobo Babylon before purchasing this one. If you're buying a second, third or fourth Deadbolt album, try and listen to the samples first. I didn't and I wish I had.Singing, melodies, rhyming and clean mixes were never part of Deadbolt's vocabulary. They started to change with Hobo Babylon, choosing to bleep out most of their swearing for some reason (some claimed this was all part of an inside joke), but even that album was true to their heard-one-heard-'em-all approach.I Should Have Killed You on the other hand sounds like they're getting soft, or the inside joke that was supposedly going on in Hobo Babylon got out of hand."
5,stories for all time,"Come & be enchanted by Peter LaGue's great illustrations to Ethel Pochocki's radiant stories of foxes & cats, dogs & rabbits, trees & girls, gypsies & mice, & the wealth of Christmas joy in The Mistletoe Girl; That's the Way It Was; The White Rabbit; How M. Philippe Spent Christmas Eve; Cat's Christmas; The Attic Creche; The Baker's Dog; A Christmas Tree for All Seasons.What I have always liked about this author's writing is its evocative, old-fashioned fantasy telling. Animals talk, trees have feelings, people think new thoughts. You will learn a little history, a little culture, as well as something about emotions -- amusement & worry. You will also have to think about ""What if the same thing happened to me?""... & Ethel Pochocki will give you some ideas, in her inimitable style.RebeccasReads recommends THE MISTLETOE GIRL & OTHER CHRISTMAS STORIES. It is filled with compassion, beauty & the meaning of community...to be reread to your grandchildren's children."
5,Given as a gift...,I gave this to a friend who collects The Simpsons figurines. He absolutely loved it! I apparently made a great choice of gifts for him.
2,I disliked the heroine too much to be able to enjoy the book.,"I loved the hero, Remy, and much of the book was a fun read. But, I don't recommend it because of my dislike of Rachel.CAUTION SPOILERS:I hated the reason she broke up with Remy. The author should have used another reason to break them up. When she finally agreed to have sex again at the cabin, it was after three days of denial. I didn't like that she made them wait three days before having sex. Then when he came to her after two weeks to try to get back together, she wouldn't have him. Also, I didn't buy the ending. She was mad at him for several reasons. Then after she saw him go onto the stage, she all of a sudden forgets the past and goes off with him? It was not a reasonable resolution.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: not counted, but at least three. Setting: the bayou, Louisiana, and a small part of the story is set in the Washington D.C. area. Copyright: 2003. Genre: contemporary romance."
1,Two thumbs down.,The early books were fun and well written. She could carry off jokes that most could not in the same circumstances. I howled. This one was a snore.Like others I had a hard time with the female character who bored on the sterotypical dumb woman syndrome with a bad case of PMS. I don't like that portrayal. I like females with a bit more brains. Perhaps that is because I like having one.It was a desperate confused romance. The male character had a lot of potential but never reached that. The ditzy female would not have been missed. This had great potential. I almost wonder if the contracts aren't forcing books too fast for Ms Hill. A bit more time in Pattee wouldn't hurt either. With such resources available a bad soap opera is not acceptable.Badly written. Badly plotted and GREAT for those with raging horomones and the syndrome.
5,The only thing that has ever got me to lose weight,"I lost 30 pounds in 6 months on this diet and kept it off. The reason this book succeeded for me where all other diets failed is that it supplied me with lots of recipes for food that I could stuff myself silly with. There is no limiting portions or stopping at one serving (with the high fiber, low fat recipes). I can make a whole pot of stew and eat the whole thing at one sitting if I want. It works for me because I find the recipes absolutely delicious. This book won't help people who dislike grains, beans or the exotic flavors it uses. But if you like this type of food, this is THE weight loss book to use!"
3,An interesting and enjoyable story.,"Two stories, actually, with only the most tenuous of connections: one set in the distant past, the story of the exiles from Vulcan who became the Romulans, their long, arduous, and near-fatal trip and the planetfall on their new world, and one set in the ""modern"" period of Star Trek, sometime, as near as I can tell, between the third and fourth Next generation movies given that Data is present with an emotion chip.The characters are handled well, the writing is smooth, the timing is good, and the plot is reasonably interesting. Definitely worth reading.Of course, it loses a star for having no beginning and no ending, but simply being the middle book of a trilogy. If that doesn't bother you like it does me, feel free to consider this a four-star review."
3,"If you read the first , you'll read this","Chekov's rescue (of course you knew he isn't dead!) is too easy. The backstory of the long trek across space of the exiles is tedious. I did like the explanation that surfaces as to how some exiles end up on Remus instead of Romulus, but that's about the best thing in this story. Still, it is new Trek lore, and it's nice new stories continue to be written."
1,vulcan snoring,"these writers have done so much better than this. granted this was a book that had to tie together two spots in vulcan/romulan history, but it was so dull, it was hard to keep reading until the end."
1,"Good story, so so author.","This book tells the interesting story of Gerald E. Huber. He won't be winning a pulitzer, but if you like pool you'll find this book interesting."
4,for the beginner,Not what I was expecting from a company that Makes one of the best cutlery on the market. OXO & Calphalon make a better product at this price point. However is a very good starter piece from the beginner cook. Would like to see this built a little heavier like their knives. (The two man Henkels that is)
2,Where was this going?,"Yes the prose about the desert was lovely but a story has to be much more and I am not sure what the point of this was. A lot of long pointless descriptions of Theobold Moons daily ablutions do not fine literature make. A story of unusual people who's lives cross over to what end?--the so-called enigmatic ending was more like the publisher lost the last chapters. All through this book I kept asking is this supposed to be a story or pieces of a puzzle which add to nothing. Yes, we solve the mystery, as if it wasn't obvious...and now. And now???"
1,dribble,"As the title suggests, this is a frivolous novel by an author of little depth. Basically, it is fluff.For the serious intellectuals (those seeking philosophically penetrating literary works), this novel is NOT for you.Fans of soap operas and made-for-tv movies, however, might want to give the book a go.The plot (centered around Theobald Moon and his daughter) is unrealistic and the description/detail is drippy. As a new novelist, Elderkin goes into elaborate (yet over the top) descriptions of everything, including flatulation.As a student of literature, I found this novel dreadful."
4,If only they'd make a sequel...,"This is a fun alternative album. Imagine that. most bands do a good job of the songs, but a few are TOO different (like Helmet's version of ""Gigantor."" It's way too heavy to be enjoyable.). However, there are several tracks that are standouts, like Violent Femmes' ""Eep-Opp-Ork-Aah-Aah."" Unbelievable! If you are only a marginal fan of these cartoons, then this may be too gimmicky for you, but if you are a fan, then ""Dig"" in. Hey, hey, hey!"
5,Love it!,This is the best Saturday morning cartoon CD! I love that they had 90's alt rock bands give all my faves growing up a new version.
5,Awesome bands for awesome cartoons,"I have been a huge fan of many of the bands that covered these children's cartoon songs. It's primarily a joke, but a great one at that."
2,Disappointing,"I knew they were covers, but it would have been nice if the songs were more like the originals. Some songs just shouldn't be altered."
2,Disappointing at best,"I'm afraid most of theses covers of cartoon based songs are uninspired and devoid of joy. They're just rehashes of the original work without much innovation or new interpretation. A couple of the songs, ""Gigantor"" and ""Eee, Opp, Ork..."" were done earlier by The Dickies in much better form.The tracks which work for me are ""The Tra La La Song"" - Liz Phair & Material Issue, ""Josie & The Pussycats"" - Juliana Hatfield and Tanya Donelly, ""Spiderman"" - The Ramones, ""Johnny Quest/Stop That Pigeon"" - Rev. Horton Heat and ""H. R. Pufnstuf"" - The Murmurs."
2,Disappointing.,"We read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper. We (my husband, three kids 14, 10, and 5) tried it on a warm, spring evening in the car. One or two songs, like the Banana Splits, Speed Racer, and Scooby-Doo were fun. Most however, were harsh, and too fast for the parents and youngest guy.I would rather try these songs in their original state and skip the covers."
4,oh to be 11 again...,"frente and w:ax make this album worth a look. still not convinced? who hasn't wondered what a ""spider man"" cover by the ramones would sound like?"
4,Good for the Guinns,"I bought this album based upon their name alone. I thought it to be an interesting novelty since my last name is Guinn. However, I found the music to be very fun and entertaining. This CD is a perfect example of R & B during the 80's. Surprised that they weren't more successful."
5,Best Business Book By Far,"As a professional organizer, I'm always interested in learning new efficiencies. This book offers more, page for page, than any of the current ""best books on business"" found on the best seller's lists. Francis makes her points briefly and succinctly in a conversational style that keeps you interested. Not only does she describe easy-to-understand techniques, she offers forms and worksheets to put her methods to work. I recommend this book to anyone who's serious about making career, business and and life as efficient and stress-free as possible."
4,My mom's a huge Betty Boop fan,"I purchased this Betty Boop bobblehead doll for my mother's birthday and she just loves it . It's red , white and blue . Very patriotic . Being that her birthday is on Independence Day . So I thought this would be a perfect gift . It's another one for her collection . Shipping wasn't fast enough for me . It took about a week . But she got her doll ."
2,Too limp,"Even when I use only a pea size amount of this conditioner, it makes my hair limp and flat. Not for me. It does smell good though!"
4,Great Product,"This is a great product and worth the penny. Your hair will feel and look healthier after using it. With other products I would have to use at least a half dollar or more of product with every shampoo. With this use maybe a nickel amount of both the shampoo and conditioner, so even though you spend more, you are using less."
3,too little for me,"-2 stars for sizei couldn't get my eyes placed on the rubbers right so stablization for me was not possible..probably ok for a small female or on a tripod but a tripod defeats the purpose+5 stars for a beautiful piece of workmanship, nonetheless"
1,Very Poor Digital Camera,"My wife bought me these binoculars for Christmas. It has finally warmed enough to try them out, DISPOINTING! The camera has no focus dial so you have no ability to get a clear picture no matter what distance you are from the subject. The binoculars are not that bad, just a little small. So save your money because these are not worth the price."
2,No good for birding,"I purchased these to record my bird sightings and although the binoculars were very good the camera images were never in focus. The instructions said to be 49 feet away from the subject to use the camera, but even then the images were fuzzy. When birding the details are important, and this camera just doesn't deliver the quality needed. If the bird had a color close to its background it was difficult to just pick the bird out of the picture, let alone tell what kind it was. In addition when using the optical zoom the images were incredibly grainy. I just can't recommend this product."
1,Piece of junk...,Not a very good binocular and a lousy digital camera. Save your money and buy a good spotting scope and a digital camera adaptor. Product returned.
3,As a matter of fact...,"I would recommend this book for all passing horror fans and experts alike; Clive Barker, that well respected mentor of modern English horror, has created a fine compendium. If at times a little pretentious, particularly in the sprawling and philosophical introduction, the layout is first-class and it doesn't dwell on the statistics-for-anoraks that so many of these type of film book do. Enjoyable, perhaps even essential for your film shelf. It is at times a little lightweight; at others, snobbish and frothy."
3,Poor binding; GREAT information,"While the first chapter of the book fell from its shotty binding, the information within is extremely interesting and Clive Barker's writing is great. I recommend this book to any horror fan, especially those of Clive Barker's fan base!"
4,Should be in your Barker library!,"This book is not written by Clive Barker, but is based on the tv-series that took its que after the successful author. As far as i can see most of the text is written by Stephen Jones. But this should not scare away the Barker fans, because the book is packed with illustrations and qoutes from our favourite author. On top of that the book contains a lot of interesting essays about a lot of horrorrelated subjects(A-Z).Great buy and beautiful book!"
2,too small,"I have a pair of SSG gloves I love. I thought this lined pair would be good for winter. I could not, however, find anything to help me know the right size. Turns out, the ladies universal 6/7 is very small. I have small hands. I can wear the gloves, but I cannot move or bend my fingers easily, which makes them rather useless."
2,Need a handbook,Not as easy or as much fun as the other Tycoon games. This is difficult to learn and should come with a book that teaches some basic stuff. I am a Tycoon player from years back and have trouble with this game. Not for young people.
1,Bad,"This game is very bad compared to the first. Really hard to make money. And why the hell do we have to build a freaking power plant?! Ugh. Buy the first. The first is very fun and addictive. This one was a miserable failure. Yes, I know, harsh words, but so true."
2,Awful,"There's no instruction manual. The tutorial is useless. It is not user friendly, and the graphics are terrible. Don't even get me started over the annoying music. It takes a while to figure out how to play."
1,YAAAAAAAWWWWWWNN,"This is the MOST BORING tycoon game ever. I take that back, the first ski resort tycoon is alot better. This game is really boring cause its impossible. they start u out with a miniscule amount of money and there are no directions on what to do at all. everything costs too much. u could just be done finishing a ski lift and boom, u are out of money. Also, the building strategy is very confusing. u could try to put a run somewhere, and without knowing it, you could accidentally run skiers off the mountain. i also dont like the ""if u buy this, u get another thing"" way the buy mode is structured. last, there are pretty much NO NEW FEATURES on the second one. so my advice is, if youve already wasted your money on the first of this series, dont waste more of it on the second one."
1,The worst tycoon game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all i never bought the first game! They start you out with like $50.000 and every building costs $20.000 and as soon as you build somthing your money goes down 10 dollars a second.another thing u have to buy buildings to earn extra buildings witch is retarted witch is normal about this game, sometimes you don't even see the ones collom because it's going down so fast. every single guy get's cold in about 10 seconds wich means that you have to build a warming shack so you have about 1,000 of these $1,000 each!So if i were you i'd bye the other tycoon games!!!!!!!!"
1,Ski Resort Tycoon II,"This game is awful, it looks like so much fun and isn't at all. There are a lot of hangups and it doesn't run well. Waste of money, which isn't necessarily the seller's fault. It got here in good condition and on time, it is just a horrible game."
3,Not as good as the first,This game is not as good at the first but still is really good. The maps are much smaller than the first but has more lift choices and has a better first person mode. There is even night skiing!!! You also have to build a ridiculous amount of buildings before you build your resort. Good advice: Buy the first one.
1,Save your money on this one,I just read through this entire book and as a SAP consultant I don't think this book is useful for either the process or the technical sides of the house. The only useful thing about this book is a short listing of the most common tcodes and menu paths that are used for FI and CO. If you are new to SAP or wanting to understand the modules from an executive perspective skip this book entirely.
5,An Intimate Account,"Most books about Grover Cleveland suffer from the same problem - no matter how hard the author tries, there is an unavoidable distance between the biographer and his subject. This is inevitable, given the carelessness with which President Cleveland preserved documents from his life, the general aloofness with which he greeted any attempts to discover more about him, and the antipathy with which he was viewed by most of his contemporaries post-1897 (when the times seemed to have evolved beyond him). Richard Watson Gilder was a close friend of President Cleveland, however, and his memoirs here provide us with something that is very hard to find elsewhere - a up-close-and-personal look at the man himself. From breezy anecdotes about fishing and children to accounts of Cleveland's mind and emotional state during the most trying periods of his presidency, this book is about as comprehensive a look at the character of the man as one could hope for."
4,Revealing,"The scandal of the 1919 Black Sox is probably the most disilluisioning chapter in the history of baseball. Asinof captured the feeling of America and its reaction to the scandal on and off field. The story is told accurately and with great insight. ""Shoeless"" Joe was a wonderful player who made bad decisions. He can be both admired and loathed by fans who now know that he wasn't completely innocent as the Sox threw the Worl d Series. It shows how baseball perserviered throught the gambling. Baseball tradition has kept the game alive through many adverse situtations and when gathered together make the history of baseball very rich. A must read for ALL baseball historians and fans."
1,horrible,did not even recieve this book! The people i rdered it from did not return many of the emails i sent! they were not cooperative! will never orderfrom them again
4,UnCovered!,"For all of you diehard New York Undercover fans waiting for the detective drama to surface on DVD some day, this selection will walk you down memory lane quenching your thirst in the interim. It was definitely a flashback ride! Listening to this CD, I could actually pin each of the songs to a particular episode and scene. You will enjoy it. I also recommend its sister soundtrack - New York Undercover: A Night At Natalie's."
4,"This Is A Good Soundtrack, BUT. . .","I'm anxiously waiting for ""New York Undercover"" to be put out on DVD. Hoolllaaa!"
4,Cool Tunes,"I had purchased this cd about 4 years ago in a store and loaned it to my brother and never got it back. Since he like it so much, I let him keep it. I finally found it! I love Amazon.com"
5,Excellent work that demands more attention.,"Sociologist Martin L. Gross has written the definitive criticism of racial/gender preferences, affirmative action, set asides, and other politically-correct nonsense. This text should be a must-read for human resources and university administrators, professors, government officials, and other members of the ""New Establishment"" (Gross's terminology).Unfortunately, this important work has not been promoted as it should. I listened to aninterview of Gross, and he has been shunned by most major media outlets regarding thiswork. They apparently don't want to deal with an intelligent argument against affirmativeaction and the ""diversity"" movement. The media would rather interview members ofextremist groups in order to discredit the anti-racial-preferences movement. Gross alsomakes this point in the book.I highly recommend this book. Please tell your friends and colleagues about it, because themedia won't."
1,The End of Sanity is a book in search of the bogey man.,"The End of Sanity is full of facts, linked together in an effort to convince the reader that the ""New Establishment"" exists. It's silly in its logic and dangerous in its invitation for people to jump to absurd conclustions. The ""New Establishment"" is akin to the nonsense spread by ordinary Germans in the 1930's - the target has changed, not the tactics."
1,Trivializes Important Issues.,"Gross' simplistic and misleading rant ignores so much reality and has so many gaping holes in its reasoning I hardly know where to begin. For one thing he is wrong when he says that the Left is the enemy of the Judaic or Judeo-Christian tradition. The Left shares the Hebrew Prophets' dream of a world where the lion will lie down with the lamb and swords will be beaten into plowshares. Righting past injustices and urging society to turn away from the sins of its past. The ""victim mentality"" as Gross calls it is really a cry for a higher standard of justice and the protection of the powerless and marginalized."
4,Gives understanding to absurd behavoirs,"Mr.Gross takes an in-depth look at the underpinnings of 'Liberal Thought' and offers numerous expamles, from court cases to university and government programs ( such as affirmative action ), to support his conclusions. Well written and compelling, It makes for an excellent read and provides the reader with a much needed sense of urgency to get involved rather than be relegated to the outer darkeness of obscutiry where much commonsense is exiled to."
4,Dated,Wanted to read up on someone who is being a watchdog to shed some light on what is going on in politics. This book makes you feel a bit bad about what is going on. Heard he has another book on how to cut some of the fluff from the budget to balance it and start paying off the big US debt. I'm into that.
5,Great book,"This book is full of information weather you are interested in rock hounding,prospecting, or just enjoy the the formations that geology brings. Great book for research too."
3,Okay basic kit,"I needed a good kit for my new 22lr pistol. This is a rifle kit with a 3 section cleaning rod but it's compact. The box is pretty sad. It's super thin material and if you ever sat on it it's ruined.Since there's no kit contents description here's a list from another kit that's correct.Contains Hoppe's No. 9 solvent, lubricating oil, patches, aluminum rifle rod, knob and slotted ends and brush.For anyone just needing something basic this will take care of you."
4,Hoppe's Cleaning Kit,"This is your typical, workman-like, .22 cleaning kit. It has the segmented cleaning rod that you screw together to clean a rifle. Everything you need is here. A good deal, and I have loved Hoppes products for over 50 years."
3,Remake not as fun,I love pokemon in the day and when I heard about pokemon red was being remade I knew I had to try it but I ended up bored with it. The only new thing is the color and new trading system but was it really needed. The game is great but it was great before. If you never played pokemon red than buy this game but if you own red than stay with it.
1,Amazon.com's customer Service Sucks,"The game works. I odered the game for my son because they had the game with a pocket video guide. There web sight seems to be messed up or buggy. Amazon.com sent me the game but failed to send me the pocket guide. I tried their online customer service to correct the problem. But, their responce was ""We don't understand"", so I called there 1-800 number. There I found a very unsympathetic and very unhelpfull customer sevice represenative. My advice is to buy the game somewhere else. I wish that I had. To bet it all I could have purchased the same product that I received from Amazon.com for less and wouldn't have had to pay shipping cost either. I am very disappointed and will never buy or give favorable advice to buy from Amazon.com"
1,this sucks,man pokemon just got whimpier it's the same thing but better graphics so what please dont by this game
4,I know this will be one of the Greatest Pokemon games ever,Pokemon has been a very great game series just like the anime on KidsWb. I have played many Pokemon games. This game has you in the very first Region called Kanto. But this remake sounds like a very great game. Also you can trade your Pokemon from Fire Red into Pokemon Ruby Version and Pokemon Sapphire Version. Also Leaf Green comes out the same day as Fire Red. This game also comes with a wireless adaptor if you did not read above. I know this game will be great. (...) This game is a must buy
2,Create a Calendar,"Almost despaired at downloading my pictures. Once I had, it was nearly impossible to replace one - almost have to take what you can get. Very disappointing. Have one more try and then I'll send it back."
5,A well researched book on false doctrine,"In Beyond Seduction[Dave Hunt's sequel to The Seduction Of Christianity] teachings that have corrupted the body of Christ inside such as; meditation, self-esteem, faith, divine revelations, prayer, healing and psychological teachings are all discussed. In this book as all the other books that Hunt writes are non-biased, well researched, and very biblical. As Hunt says in the book and I quote[pg.6] ""Moreover it should be clearly understood that hearts,motives,and ministries are not being judged but doctrines only, that there are varying degrees of error"". The material in the book discusses how the church is today.2 Timothy 4:3 describes it [KJV]; ""For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears."""
1,cheap part,I agree with others about the quality of this part. It is very cheap and does not last long at all. Mine cracked in six months and got worse and worse.
1,Product too thin and cracks easily.,"I am so frustrated that this is the best Oster can do. I have literally been through at least four of these bases in the last few years - when the original lasted at least ten. They are too thin and crack with the slightest over twist. Frustrating. I have had more than one smoothie end up on the counter thanks to these, yet I must purchase yet another now...argh."
2,Oster blender jar base replacement part,"The item I received was a lighter weight version, not as heavy duty as the original. I'll have to be careful not to tighten it very much to avoid cracking it."
2,Cheap,"There seems to be a recurring theme with these replacement Oster blender parts, ""we make cheap junk"". I have a really nice chrome Oster blender I've had for years, and I wanted to order some extra parts for it but everything I have received has been worthless. The quality of materials and workmanship is pathetic compared to what originally came on my blender. The shipping cost is more than the parts so they know you aren't going to return it.If you are at the point of needing to replace the tops and bottoms of your blender, you might as well just go buy a decent blender because, either they aren't making the same quality anymore, or nobody's selling it here."
1,flimsy -- not what the picture is,"Yes, it does fit the standard osterizer blender. Yes, it works. But the quality of the material is horrible. The threads are weak and the plastic is is quite thin -- much thinner than what the picture shows and much thinner than the original base that came with my plastic. So, if you try to screw it on a little too tight, it'll flex. Over time (a few uses) the base will start to form cracks and then it'll break. Sucks to have a $75 blender and then have to throw it out because the stupid flimsy base keeps breaking."
4,Does the job,"This jar base is actually made by Oster (as opposed to deceptively labeled NON-OEM parts which can be seen advertised all over the web). It fit the base of my 12-year-old Oster blender just fine. That being said, this replacement base is thinner and flimsier than the very thick and sturdy base that came with my original blender. As long as I treat this new one carefully, it should be OK."
5,"Worked great with Osterizer Classic, but buy a sealing ring too!","This was my second replacement jar base for a glass Osterizer classic that I bought many years ago. Yes, it is not as thick as the one it replaced, but it works very well *if* you also replace the sealing ring (rubber washer) at the same time. Those need replacing every few years, but most people just keep tightening the jar base tighter and tighter to compensate for the deteriorating ring. Eventually the base cracks, but it is not enough at that point just to replace the base, you have to replace the ring too! The sealing rings get stiff and shrink over time, so the only way to avoid leakage is to replace them periodically."
3,cracked blender jar base,"bought about 5 of these, they are not the greatest, do not overtight or you will crack it. Buy several."
1,What a piece of junk,"The threads are so spare; it keeps popping off when I try to screw it on with the blade and washer in place. It screws on great without them, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the blender. The price was cheap and that's what it is."
1,Was a total rip-off,I used this product once before it cracked. I pushed my blender under the cabinet and the base broke into several pieces.
4,the replacement blender jar base was a great quality,I received it right away and the quality of the product its good. I would definetely recommend this product to others
3,"Oster, make thicker blender jar bases PLEASE!","While the blender jar base was a perfect fit, I noticed a huge difference in the thickness of the plastic for the base from the older models. These new ones are cheap. It's no wonder it broke. I've only had this blender for two years and use it moderately."
4,Basic Replacement Part,"This is a basic/OEM replacement base. The piece fits the Blender Jar/Pitcher perfectly well, but has some difficulty in seating on the blender base. I think this is due to it being a universal piece. So far, I've had no problems from it. I just wish it would seat better."
3,Cheap but good enough!,"I agree with a lot of the other posters in that this is not the same quality as original Oster products. But at this price, I never expect it to be as good. And it does not fit quite well into the motor as the original ... but it works!If I expected original quality and fit, I'd pay about 3 times more for the original product. For this price I understand that corners are cut and I accept that.Would I buy this again? I don't know. I guess it will depend on the price difference when I need to replace it. Would I recommend it for others? Probably not."
1,Does not fit,This replacement blender jar base does not fit my glass Oster blender. The description said it would fit Oster blenders.
4,It works!,"Not much to say about this replacement base. It fits and it works fine, as it should if you've shopped carefully. But it's way overpriced for what it is. I waited until I had $25 in Amazon purchases so I wouldn't have to pay S&H."
1,Do not buy this!,"I wish I had listened to all of the negative reviews. I have an Osterizer blender but this didn't fit right at all. After trying for a few minutes I thought I had finally gotten it threaded on correctly and tried to make a smoothie but it ended up running out the bottom of the blender and all over the floor. After taking a closer look I realized that there was no way this base was ever going to tighten down on by blender, the threads were just totally the wrong size or pitch or something. The seller was nice enough to refund my money and said I didn't even have to return it so it just went straight in the trash. I know it's cheaper than the part on the Oster website but buying this is just not worth your time."
4,Good Replacement,"Works great with both my standard Glass Carafe and the Stainless one I purchased afterwards, buy the orgiinal, my only complaint is I wish this would have been made out of Black Material all the way through, the paint chips off and it is white underneath. Happened to both of these."
1,Caps Don't Fit,"I bought a couple of these and the threads of both were off just enough to make it nearly impossible to seat the cap properly which resulted in a huge mess all over the blender several times. Conversely, trying to get the caps off iwas equally near impossible even after running under hot water.All edges are unfinished and sharp so look forward to lacerated fingers.I've since thrown them out. A complete waste of money. Try to find true Oster bases which will work properly."
4,I was expecting to get the 5-fined...,I bought the product from Goodman's thinking I was going to get the thick 5-fined version like what the others posted but got ol' cheapo one. I guess it's a lottery but the one I received will do for now. I'll update my review in a couple months..
4,SO GOOD,"IT FIT PERFECTLY BUT I WISH THAT THEY HAD A STRONGER ONE. I'LL HAVE TO BUY THIS AGAIN AFTER THIS BREAKS. IF ONLY THIS WAS A LOT MORE DURABLE. OH WELL, YOU CAN'T FILE A LAWSUIT."
1,Oster Replacement Bas,"I'm glad that I ordered two of these as the apparent quality is no different than the lousy original. Neither has broke yet but I haven't used them either. Needless to say, my expectations are low."
1,Blender jar base does not match picture.,"I have posted a picture of the old, thick, heavy Oster blender jar base next to the new, thin, lightweight model. The Oster blender jar base being sold by Amazon matches the unit shown on the right of my picture. It does not match the Amazon picture. Oster has chosen to replace its original, heavy-duty blender jar base with a cheaply-made, inferior knock off. This poor quality blender jar base seems to come with all new Oster blenders. This is an important point to consider when shopping for a new blender.Update, April 29, 2011:Today, I called Oster and the representative said that the Oster replacement blender jar base shown in the picture is no longer available. This representative also told me that mine is the first complaint she has received about the poor quality of this part. However, she also said that if enough people call and document their complaints about the blender jar base, Oster will produce an improved part."
1,Poor quality,"I revently bought an Oster Blender to replace the one I had for over 10 years. After one use, the wall of the blender jar base split. I noticed that the wall of the base was much thinner than the old one I had. Looking at the picture of the replacemnt part, it appeared to me to have a much thicker wall than the one that split, so I ordered it. Regretably, the base that I received has the same thin wall as the one that split. I suspect that it won't last. The picture is deceiving and the price for a replacement is outrageous given it's poor quality."
1,Poorly Made,"Before purchasing I read the other reviews so I already knew that the replacements break easily. Considering this I have taken great care not to tighten the bottom too much. However, after maybe one month of use the bottom has already cracked and broken. What a shame that I have a great blender that I can't even use just because the replacement parts are so poorly made."
2,Not as pictured,"The item pictured is the old-style melamine blender jar base that was virtually indestructible. What I got, instead, was the new-fangled plastic version which is imminently destructible."
3,only adequate,"The blender jar base is not as well-made as the original. The plastic does not seem as strong. It has been painted and the dark paint immediately began to wear off and show white plastic underneath. Finally, the jar with the new base is a bit wobbly on the machine. As far as I can tell, it still does the job after a month of use for making smoothies. No leakage from the base has been noted, so far."
2,It doesn't fit my blender,"It doesn't even fit my blender tightly enough to use it. I ended up having to buy a whole replacement kit from Walmart (that included a new blade and lid) All I needed was a base (mine had cracked) so this option was the route I wanted to go, but it doesn't fit the blender."
1,IT LEAKS,"THE DAMN THING LEAKS! No matter how many ever times I try to screw it properly to my blender jar it still leaks through some sort of gap. My washer and other parts are new and in good condition, so that isn't the problem. SO annoying. Have to go to Walmart and buy a new jar+base I guess"
5,Blender Jar Base - Oster,No problems!! Order arrived on time and I was soooo happy to be able to use my Oster blender again since the original base cracked and I needed a new one.
3,"Good, but breaks easily","Ive purchased two of these because I've had two break. They aren't very sturdy. Also, the seal with the actual jar of the blender seems to be less than ideal. Not sure if that's the rubber washer or this piece. Either way, I'm saving my pennies for a BlendTec."
5,Oster base replacement,"The replacement part for the Oster blender came on time, at reasonable cost and works great. I love no hassle purchases."
1,Replacement Blender Jar Base,I could not get it to screw onto the jar. It seems to have a different thread. I had purchased another one earlier and it worked perfectly.
5,works as expected,"When my blender's jar base of 15 years cracked, I ordered a new jar base and it works like new."
3,It will work,"The base doesn't fit exactly right, but it will work. This is a common occurance when ordering on-line. The review requires two more wods. so here are several."
5,Good purchase,I bought this for my husband for work. He says it works great and when needed will purchase this product again.
5,love it,i broke my blender jar abut a month ago and was trying to fix it all different way (non of them worked)i found this replacement on amazon for REALLY good price plus free shipping.worked perfectly for me!!!
1,Didn't Fit Beehive Osterizer; Seller Didn't Respond,"Like others note, this product is different than the base that originally comes with the Osterizer Beehive Blender. While some say that it is thicker--and thus better--it did NOT fit my Beehive Square Jar AT ALL. I wrote to the seller to request a replacement or return, but never heard back. Look carefully at (a) the grooves that are meant to screw onto your glass jar, and (b) the center opening that secures this base to the blender. Compare this base to the one you're replacing (mine old one unfortunately got warped in the dishwasher--but it clearly had a different lip around the center opening that allowed it to actually sit on the metal blender peg; this base opening DOES NOT)."
1,A Poor Quality Knock-off,"I attempted to screw this into a glass base and it wouldn't screw all the way down tight. Instead there was a gap where if you shook the glass with base, the metal blades would clang around. It has to be tight in order for the gasket to seal the liquids in the glass container. My first (and last) attempt in blenderizing with this product resulted in liquid squirting from the base all over the blender and counter top.This is a knock-off of the original Osterizer part. I thought it was an authentic Oster part when I placed my purchase. I should become policy of Amazon to demand knock-off information on the product page as a warning.I am learning that you must be very careful when you purchase anything on Amazon. It has cost me a lot to have my head in the sand about these things."
1,product is poorly made and does not fit,"I bought this as a replacement base for my oster beehive blender. It did not fit and leaked horribly; when I tried to tighten it further, it immediately cracked into 2 pieces. This does NOT fit and is badly made. I'm still looking for a better replacement."
1,Base too flimsy for heavy glass blender,"The image shows a base that appears to be the heavy duty kind that came with the original glass Osterizers many years ago. However, this base is made from a thinner plastic that cracks too easily, and didn't even last as long as the similar one that came with the newer glass blender. Better to rummage garage sales for an original base."
1,Poor build quality. Will destroy your blade. Is this really an Oster?,"This plastic base (is it really made by Oster??) is thinner and does not fit as well as the original.Not only that, the dimensions are very slightly off. Due to this the jar no longer fits snugly into the blender base.Because of this, the blender drive does not engage very well with the blade. Occasionally it slips. Over time (in my case over 4 months), it smoothed out the blender drive and the blade socket enough that it no longer engages.This piece of crap has made my blender unusable."
3,Ok,It was a good book but It could have been better. It had a great plot but the ending left something to be desired. I'm going to give book number 2 a try and see if it gets better. Fingers Crossed.
3,comfort reading,"Dog Soldiers was a quick and enjoyable read. Peyton clearly writes about a topic that is near and dear to his heart so he writes authoratatively. I read the book in one sitting. It has solid character development and a good plot. I recommend the book for those who are nostalgic about the their freer and easier younger days as well as those that like Harleys. Unlike many biker books, Peyton steers clear of the sensationaized excesses in his tale. He writes about the normalcy of being different."
5,Peyton strikes again!,"I have been reading Quinn's work for a long time, and his books and videos have changed my view on self-defense. I was a litle worried about how he would transition to a fictional work. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed, Dog Soldier is great book that keeps you involved in the reading all the time, with characters that stay on your mind even when you've finished the book. I really hope that this is not the last fictional book written by Peyton Quinn."
4,Dog Soldiers,"I dont typically choose this genre, but I have read some of Peyton'snon-fiction work and always appreciated his direct, no nonsense style and approach. I ordered Dog Soldiers with some apprehension, but right from the first few pages the subject was captivating and the story engaging . If you are a fan of this genre you will really enjoy this book. And if you are a fan of the subject matter as well, you will certainly love this book. Once again Peyton delivers with his familar style and doesn't disappoint."
3,A Mirror Image of Greatness Lost.......,"Les Claypool's interpretation of Pink Floyd's masterpiece Animals does not vary much from the original work. There is no doubt that Claypool is a master bass player who has a penchant for the offbeat, but here Les' oddball personality is shackled and chained within the Floyd framework. For curiosity purposes only I bought this cd (and because I own everything else Les has ever done) with low expectations knowing full well that it would be difficult if not impossible to live up to the Floyd legend. I'm sorry to say, they don't pull it off. The Frog Brigade is an immensely talent band (much of which consisted of Sausage) but they should put their talents to original compositions instead of just retreading in common waters. Bottom line: if I want to listen to Pink Floyd Animals, I would put that Cd in my cd player. Recommended for hard-core completists only."
5,As good as it gets!,"The idea of hearing Les Claypool playing the Animals of Pink Floyd was to good to be true. And it ends being waaayyy to good!!The best of the disc is that they play the way they do, not trying to imitate the Animals itself. Making their own sound of it."
4,Quite good!,"I'm a hardcore Floyd fan and really enjoyed this album. I do prefer the Floyd version but the Frog Brigade did a good job on this cover. The keyboard is a bit weak and the vocalist on Sheep sucks - they should have used Les. Nevertheless, they stick to the songs and take few liberties except on Sheep. A few of the lyrics are off but not by much. Despite these weaknesses it is worth a listen."
4,Die Hard Pink Floyd Fan,"Credit Les Claypool for recording a live version of Pink Floyd Animals, the most underated album of all time. An great addition to my collection."
4,not too shabby,It's not perfect. My only comment is that the one thing lacking from Floyd's original version is a driving bass line. This version offers the thump that many of us are look for with the talent to fill in the surrounding essentials.
4,Les does Pink,"This entire album is a live recording of Les Claypool's band covering Pink Floyd's ""Animals"" album. This happens to be one of my favorite Pink Floyd albums, so when I happened to hear that he did this I picked it up. It definitely does not disappoint, staying relatively close to the album throughout. The musicianship is definitely on par with Floyd, and the vocals are surprisingly well done. A great effort and a great listen for any Floyd fan."
4,Les Claypool covering one of the best albums of all time,"This is certainly one of the best albums by Pink Floyd and displays master musicianship in forms of simplicity.Les Claypools cover of the album is not exactly note for note and has a much darker and esp. bass heavy feel to it. This hole album keeps a strong beat throughout and it has some very soulful instrumentals. Mocking Les' vocals is like suring in nabraska it just doesn't count. Clearly Les was not trying to be tounge and cheek, and his effort is good.I listen to this cover album as often as I listen to the original. The vocals certainly arn't as good, but the musical aspects and esp. the saxophone have a unique nastalga that is hard to overlook.This album is for open minded music lovers that love to induldge in the instrumental part of the album rather then the vocal sections.EnjoyCAH"
1,Buy a different Les Claypool CD,"I love The Floyd and I love everything Les has done up until Frogs: Set 2. Don't get it. It is a pale carbon copy of a masterpiece. Instead, get Oysterhead: The Grand Pecking order. I haven't heard it yet, but it's bound to be better than this.That's my 2 cents.P.S. Buy Syd Barrett CDs: Madcap Laughs, Barrett, Piper at the Gates of Dawn."
1,Wrong Album Shown for MP3 version of How To Make An American Quilt,"You have the wrong album posted for the MP3 download version of How to Make An American Quilt movie soundtrack. You have something called American Quilt, which is not composed by Thomas Newman and which does not contain the pieces from the How To Make An American Quilt album. PLEASE TAKE THIS DOWN AND PUT UP THE ""CORRECT"" MP3 ALBUM!!!"
5,At grandma's house on a sunday afternoon....,"I just watched this movie this past weekend...excellent movie AND music - i watched the movie twice, once for the movie, the second for the music. It's just a very soothing soundtrack, it takes me back to visiting grandma's house on a sunday afternoon. My grandmother used to quilt, and she'd always humm different tunes..something about this music reminds me of those days. And Cherry, Cherry reminds me of my mother - who absolutely LOVES niel diamond ;)This soundtrack is an excellent for background music while reading, or just relaxing on any day of the week. I give it 5 ***** stars!!!"
4,Lovely,I enjoyed both Whitney Otto's book and the movie - the stories were so touching and having the music extends that enjoyment for me. Some pieces are quite haunting...
1,Motor just quits,"I've had two of these Remington DT-1000's. The first one quit after a few months. (Yes, the batteries were inserted correctly.) I liked the way it worked so I bought another one, and kept this one outside the bathroom in case the humidity was affecting it. But the second one quit in less than a month. Needless to say, I'll be buying some other brand now."
2,Not exactly what I expected.....,"I decided to purchase this item after ourWAHL Detailing, Battery Trimmerdied. I thought since this item had a few more attachments it would be a good deal. I unfortunately was very wrong. This item does not have the power to trim my boyfriends goatee. I have the hardest time getting it to cut any of his facial hair. I have tried changing the batteries, etc, and it still does not have the power to do what I want it to do. I wish I would have just replaced the original item with the same item. I strongly wish I would have never purchased this item. I would not buy this item again if I knew it was going to not have the power to do anything, as it was a waste of my time and money. Now I am out the money I paid for this and the money I am going to have to spend to replace it. I will just go back to the old faithfulWAHL Detailing, Battery Trimmerbecause I know that it works. If I were anyone I wouldn't waste my money on this item because its not worth the time or effort."
4,I wouldn't have thought that I could get so many features at this price,"Once one reaches a certain age facial hair grooming takes on extra dimensions. That being said, I also have a pretty good sized mustache that requires regular grooming or else it takes over my face. I was looking at several more expensive sets when this one caught my eye. I thought that at the very least I could use it for traveling. Much to my surprise it is a very versatile trimmer that I now use every day.The assorted, interchangeable heads makes it like having 4 trimmers instead of one. I have had it for several months now and it seems to hold up well. I am very happy with my purchase."
5,great value,great convienient razor for the money. have 2 at home. been through 3 sets of batteries on first and still cuts great.
1,Poor quality,This is a cheap product. My chocolate pieces chipped and would not slide easily off the mold. I ended up wasting perfectly good chocolate. I would recommend purchasing a polycarbonate plastic mold instead.
3,Maybe I'll use it someday,One more thing that sounded fun just long enough to buy the supplies (making chess pieces out of chocolate for the chess teacher at school)... glad I didn't pay too much since they're now in the basement with the rest of my 'good' ideas.
3,Good enough,"About the same quality stores in my area carry but slightly less expensive. They are mushy. Taste is adequate for pizzas (which is what I wanted them for). One can was dented and leaked (not the fault of UPS or Amazon, this was at the packing plant). Amazon immediately gave me a choice of a partial credit or to return all the cans. What more could you ask?"
1,Third spoiled tin,"this is the third 2 ounce tin of Reese Anchovies that is about to explode, I forget where I bought them, it may have been world market or trader joe's, however at the moment they do not have this product in stock.Generally they are ok for the price but when they spoil in the can the price is too high. I have not had any response fromWorld Finer Foods Inc.300 Broadacres DriveBloomfield, NJ 07003and after 2 weeks I don't expect oneReese Flat In Olive Oil, 2-Ounce (Pack of 10)Best before date is 06/01/2011Code - AS031108-1105"
1,Bony and spiky,This is the worst product that I've ever had. It is spiky and bony. I am surprise no one has yet choke on it. I would never buy this again. The more expensive Spanish imports taste much better than this without the spiky bones.
4,underrated true adventure story,"SKYWARD is a terrific book about the early days of aviation in this country! Written by one of our country's greatest explorers, the most highly decorated american ever, Byrd takes us from his early trainning days at pensacola to his north pole flight, transatlantic crossing, and south polar flight, and includes some other pretty exciting adventures along the way. It is a vibrant story written by a young man who is probably best known in literary circles for ALONE , a much more introspective book which he wrote later in life."
5,Sus Mejores Exitos,"Yo compre este album y la verdad es que es la mejor recopilacion de exitos de sus dos ultimos albumes y algunas canciones de cuando se llamaban Onda Vaselina. Definitivamente un disco excellente, pero si tu ya cuentas con el disco CD00 de este grupo, no te lo recomiendo pues contiene gran parte de este cd, las mismas canciones, pero si te encantan las canciones de este grupo, simplemente lo vas a adorar..."
2,Not so good,"Not a total bust. It provides some smoothing, and may be good for those with sensitive skin. I can get close to the exfoliation as this product provides, with scrubbing gloves. I wouldn't buy it again, there are better products on the market."
2,#KC1379,"This product came with damage to the leather strap. I would have returned it , but the person to whom I gave it would not let me. Considering that it was in an unopened package, it is a bit perplexing. Did it come from Kenneth Cole like that? If so, they need to improve their quality control."
1,damaged goods,"The watch appeared to have been glued into the watch box and the glue damaged the leather strap, striping the colour from the band. There was also damage to the clasp. I returned the item to Amazon and noted the damage, but was charged return postage, even though I received damaged goods. The refund was processed quickly but I did not receive a response about the damage and have not been refunded the postage! Ugh!!"
3,see through,Although I did use these for my wedding invitations (I am not to picky about that stuff) I did notice that I could see my information right through the envelopes when addressing them. Also I bought some of the same size from Walmart which were the same price for 100 but came in sets of 50 but the total for 2 boxes of 50 was the same price as on amazon. The walmart brand closed and stayed sealed well but these from amazon over half the box of them had to be extra taped shut. Not really a big deal but just something to be prepared for I guess. I used the double sided tape to close the ones that came open. Oh and the walmart brand was just as see through.
2,"Ok, but redi-seal strip not in good location","The envelopes are thin, and don't feel like they'd stand up to having anything more than a flat card in them or they might tear - however, by being thin, they don't weigh much so may save on postage if you're close to going over that ounce. Additionally the seal strip is not against the edge of the envelope flap, so it leaves about 3/8"" loose which may or may not get caught in the mail system's automated conveyors. I prefer the type with the gummed flap that you have to moisten since it goes to the edge."
2,Keep jamming in my printer,"I bought these to replace a different brand that I couldn't find on Amazon. Unlike the other brand, these always jam in my Epson R200 printer, even though I press the edges flat and try to loosen the long sides by pre-curling them. I can usually finally get them to feed, but it takes way too much babying."
5,Works great for home printed cards.,I like to make my own birthday and holiday cards at home. It's quick and much cheaper than buying cards for everyone for their special events. The only problem I've had is finding an envelope to fit my home made cards into & these envelopes are a perfect solution. They are sturdy and my cards fit perfectly into them.
4,Nice quality,I like the nice weight to these envelopes and the self sealing strip is great. I would definaitely buy again.
4,Exactly what we need,"Perfect for sending out 5x7 pictures to family and friends. They're a little thin, but not so much so that it feels like the photos will be damaged. Plus - they were cheaper here than any other place I looked. Exactly what we need."
3,Too big for 5 x 7 cards,"These envelopes are decent quality, but they are really too large for cards that measure 5 x 7 inches. I am going to return them."
3,See through,"These envelopes were see through and a but flimsy. I am using them for wedding invites, and I will need to wrap a piece of paper around the informtion to prevent the information to been seen."
2,Weakly written,"This one seems like it was a hash job done to get something on the shelf for the movie. The time-jumping is unnecessary, as is the first person perspective. This book is 202 pages or so, and by page 65 I was done. It's not a hard story to tell, and there was a lot of characterization going on that felt half-hearted and forced. Clearly the author had a deadline to make and a paycheck to earn. There wasn't much effort made to make this book worth reading. I'll check out the movie instead."
1,Broke during warrantee- will TEAC honor warrantee?,"About 10 months after I bought this CD Player, it died. I sent it in for warrantee service on 3-23-2006 - yet as of today, 8-4-2006, I have not received it back. The service center says that Teac needs to deliver a part. Teac acknowledged as much. For a while, Teac said they would try to find the part, but now Teac no longer even answers email, and telephone support seems non existant.Bottom line: Maybe you'll be lucky, and your machine won't break right away, but if it does, even if it is warranted, good luck!"
1,Teac CD-P1250 did NOT work out of the box,The CD player I recently bought from you arrived in non-working order. I e-mailed the seller but received no reply.
5,OOF Sound track,What can I say? Love the music. Can't beat the price either. Sound quality excellent. Arrived quickly. I listen while driving in the car and it's very calming.
4,Even more hardcore than Tithe,"People say this book is much too adult for teenagers, but I beg to differ. The explicit language, sexual overtones, and drug themes among teens are, sadly, much more realistic than adults would like to think. Black does tend to throw in too much shock value material, but as a fourteen-year-old I can say I wasn't scarred for life. Black is an expert at creating an atmosphere, and in Valiant she weaves a dark portrait of the outcasts of urban society, and some of Val's feelings are very relatable for teens. For instance, I could have sworn Holly Black reached into my head when Val was thinking about how she thought of herself as a secondary character, the one who set up one-liners instead of delivering them. The mature themes are dealt with without the moralizing that is so common in teen literature. If the writing had been shined up a bit, and the characters developed a little more, this could have been better than Tithe."
4,Faerie Exiles,"Holly Black's second modern tale of faerie leaves Tithe's Kaye and Roiben in NJ. This tale introduces new characters all living in some sort of exile in NYC. Faeries exiled from both the Seelie and Unseelie court are introduced and interact with new human characters, Lolli, Dave, Luis and Val.Hard images of drug addiction, prejudice, family dysfunction, and homelessness are seen through the once innocent eyes of heroine, Val. Through the pen of Holly Black, the reader sees Val cope with horrors and adjust to heart-wrenching conditions. However, Val also finds solace and the freedom to love that comes from forgiveness.This is a touching story that again shows the guiding force of humanity and concern for others as the key to self-realization and happiness."
4,"Not as Good, but not Bad","The story has the same mood as Tithe, but there are significant differences... I personally prefered Tithe to this one, but there are good points I must say. The book takes place in New York City, perhaps this makes more people familiar with the setting then they would have with Tithe. As for the comedic values that were occassionally thrown in Tithe, there might be less here, but they still exist. All in all, if you liked Tithe, you'll probably like this one."
4,Jbird,Black continues to create a world where the reader is drawn to it's mysteriousness. The characters are so well developed that you imagine yourself reeking havic on the city.
3,It's ok.....,"I wouldn't recommend this book to young readers at all. It's filled with bad language, drug use and casual sex. I didn't feel that it really expressed the wrongness of that behavior though it tried in the end. All in all I wouldn't have finished it if I didn't enjoy it on some level but I wouldn't recommed it to teens."
5,valiant indeed,"Although the story may have seemed unbelievable at times with how things worked out, I couldn't put it down and wasted half my day reading it. The descriptions and characters are vivid, and the story is definitely different in the way that it's like a traditional fairy tale turned completely around with shamelessness, violence, reversed roles, and a heap of a lot of other nice bad stuff. There's love and kindness in there too, but that doesn't spoil how awesome the story is."
5,wonderful!,"Black is a gifted storyteller with the ability to show the true harsh reality of the real world. The way she is able to blend the now with a fairie realm is amazing.In this novel, seventeen year old Valerie catches her mother and boyfriend together intimately and runs away from home. It was not her intention to ""run-away."" She simply just doesn't want to go home, yet. After missing the tram, she sleeps the night on a bench and in the morning buys coffee at a nearby coffee shop. There she meets two unusual people. From there she gets deeper and deeper into the world of faerie. After meeting a troll, who lives under a bridge (LOL), and discovers she likes him, strange as he may seem, she wants to help him when he is accused of murder.Wonderful tale you won't want to put down. I'm anxious to see what else Ms. Black has up her sleeve!"
2,Ehh...,"Well, I'm not going to say it's TERRIBLE, but it's not great (or even good, really). Very readable and it certainly keeps one occupied. If you have time to fill, then I'd probably suggest this book.However, Holly Black puts in a lot of shock-value and little substance. Every person in her little universe is terribly dysfunctional to the point where her characters aren't believable in the least.It's definitely not 'favorite book' material."
4,More Fey Travels,"Valiant takes off in different directions from Tithe. There are some similar tertiary characters, but overall it's a completely different book. This book also touches on some gritty themes: teen addiction, homelessness, sexuality, shoplifting, and mother/daughter problems.I found the writing stronger in this book, but maybe I enjoyed the plot/story more so than Tite. (Tithe is a good book). These books are not for young kids, but rather for teens. Some parents might find the themes in these books to adult-like; however, I think that it might be more realistic to offer the books as examples of the problems of addiction and how unromantic homelessness is for these street kids."
2,Skip it go to Ironside,"I really didn't like this book and thought that the title was ironic, no one in the book ever acts Valiantly. I like Holly Black as an author but I feel that she struggles to make you feel for and care about her characters. Ironside is back to being a good story so don't give up here, I wanted to but I am glad I read the next one."
3,Riding the Crest of the Young Adult Wave,"YA fantasy seems to be more popular than ever, and Holly Black's right in the middle of it.As another reviewer mentioned, this is better than Tithe, though the world of teenagers that Black serves up is a bit raw and sensationalist. In Valiant, the magic drug use keeps it honest, and not edgy for edgy's sake. (Still a few too many unnecessarily ""brutal"" elements make it a bit callow.)Definitely a fast paced book that'll hold your interest."
3,I enjoyed it.,Not my favorite YA novel but I enjoyed it none the less. POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD!!!!I thought I'd be somewhat uncomfortable with the burgeoning relationship between Val and Ravus but I really ended up rooting for them as time went on. I think it cleared things up too quickly at the end but I am happy with how things turned out.
2,Too slow introduction into the world of Faerie; too much preamble.,"The action is too slow. To encounter a single fairy the reader has to go to a slow and painful journey of minor unimportant details through almost five chapters. To say the least I was completely dissapointed. I read Tithe, and although it was not the best book on fairies i've yet read, It was entertaining with plot and characters well presented. However, Valiant is a poor follow-up. As a reader I did not feel any empathy for the main character, and the author was more concerned in presenting EVERY aspect of the life of homeless kids than presenting the magical world of Fairie and the extraordinary creatures that inhabit it.I almost gave up reading at the first two chapters because it was completely boring, but I have the practice to finish every book I start. So for your own sake don't begin walking through a road of empty words, dull characters and unbelievable plot."
3,For the sake of the legend maybe this story is better untold,"I jumped at the chance to read this, looking for that bit more info to explain the extraodinary phenomenon that was, and surrounded, The 'Roses, but unfortunately all I got was information I largely knew anyway, which is no fault of the author.However, it is on the not-so-well-written side (for me) of the ledger, and I was annoyed at the author's seemingly implied part in it all.The key to The 'Roses was their enigma, which time, and any bio, is certain to destroy, so in fairness anyone tackling this is up against it. I guess their tragic (for good music) career and demise also makes reading this hard. It's tough when you know how a story ends, especially when it's sad."
2,Awaiting the resurrection,"This is a thoroughly researched, but poorly written book about a fascinating band."
3,Over-rated,"Granted the story of the Stone Roses is fascinating enough. The problem I have is that the author's writing style is around tabloid level. The text is cliche ridden and typos abound. The photo section is sorely lacking as well. No childhood, family, or early band photos are included. A good discography including bootlegs is also missing. Too bad this is the only book on the band currently available. I would say get it if you're a fan but buyer beware !"
3,"Reading Shouldn't be Physically Painful, Should It?","It is really unfortunate that Robb's book seems to be the only comprehensive one written about the amazing Stone Roses. While the book contains much in the way of content and information, it is horribly written. This book is, despite the compelling subject matter, truly painful to read. Characterizing Robb's writing style and editing skills as amateurish is insulting to competent amateur writers everywhere.A talented, professional writer really needs to take up the task of writing a scholarly biography of the Roses."
3,For delicate hands only!,"Although the idea of offering illustrated ""scenery"" so you can play each time a new variation of a pooh story is great, the background is actually too simplistic (not that a lot of details are always a good option) and the colours have an overall greenish hue, nothing of the vivid pooh colours we are accustomed to. The puppets are better made (more durable) than other finger-puppets, but still, if your child is biting, forget it! At least I throw them in the washing machine without thinking twice and if you have small fingers they fit perfectly. If not, they are way too tight! The ""box"" on the front cover is too delicate (mine was crushed at the corners from the delivery already), and little fingers can get cut from the easily-torn plastic cover, if they decide to fumble a lot. Finally, it would be far greater value if at a small extra cost they could add some other characters too..."
5,A Highly Practical Resource on Team Rewards,"If you're reading this review you already get it -- you can't engage teams while only rewarding individuals. But how do you do it? The literature and seminars that purport to deal with team-based rewards are heavy on theory but lean on actual application. ""Rewarding Teams"", however, provides an outstanding, highly practical resource for executives, line managers and HR professionals. It builds on the reward systems model presented in Jerry McAdam's prior book, ""The Reward Plan Advantage"", presenting strategies that reposture compensation dollars from a cost of doing business to an investment in performance improvement. The many case studies in the book provide an extremely helpful framework for understanding the issues, alternatives and key success factors in designing team-based reward systems. The last chapter, a summary of ""lessons from the trenches"", is alone worth the investment in the book."
5,A TIMELESS TALE,"Somerset Maugham's ""The Moon and Sixpence"" was definitively brought to screen life by George Sanders and Herbert Marshall.Sanders' portrayal of the brilliant but obsessed artist Paul Gauguin is nothing short of mesmerizing, and Herbert Marshall holds his own in the understated urbane manner for which he became known.This is a timeless tale that moves compellingly to the inevitable denouement.I've found Ivy Classics Video of Charlotte, North Carolina, makes some of the finest VHS releases - classics all and well worth keeping in a collection."
1,Just awful!,"The GoodI only had to sit through five songs. I really dug the model on the cover too.The BadI tried and tried to find something good about this release, but every time I thought I had something, I was reminded at how piercing, whiney, annoying, and out-of-tune the vocals were. The band has some decent beats and chord changes similar to 70s David Bowie and more recently Jet. However, Jeremy Lublin's vocals are so accentuated and over-emphasized to mimic the style of late 70s glam and post punk, that they are jarring to the ear and impossible to enjoy. Despite his American roots, Lublin does a great job of sounding like every British punk band frontman that didn't quite have it. Perhaps if he was backed up by hard charging punk rock distortion and frantic chord changes, things would be different.The VerdictJust awful!"
4,Interesting travels,"I thought it was well written, and kept my interest. I was just disappointed that her dog was attacked by other dogs on the walk and she did not protect him with a beebe gun or something!I am an animal activist and rescuer and it is not wise to allow your dog to wander and be at the mercy of other animals, wild or domestic."
3,I thought the beats had swizz probably cheese...,"Wow, I felt this CD was going to be #1 since it's me bitches and money in the bank are awesome club anthems. So I thought hey the whole CD comes pack with different sound that will revolutionized music in this Year. I'm listening right now through amazon and Wow was I disappointed. I hate when artists put amazing singles expecting people to buy their album like we were hipnotize by one song. Believe me, people with music knowledge obviously know what kind of material artist come out with and an average how the album sale will do.Is obvious to much talk and doing nothing. The album sounds the same rapping and braggin and only two songs from the album work!!Oh my swizzy should think next time...Don't buy this album!"
2,Loses contact with base twice a week,"I just got this set up and all looked well. Nice design....except it won't stay in contact with the outsidebase that is only 20 feet away on the front porch (covered and protected) only one wall to penetrate.Have to reset the clock 2 and 3 times a week. It's a shame, this is a nice designed unti with a backlite.UPDATE...........called Honeywell.....they say when it looses contact.PUSH THE DOWN BUTTON to reestablish contact with the base..it works, the outside temp came back on........but for how long it let you know in a new update in a week."
3,Works OK most of the time,A pretty good little unit. Gives good information and has a few extras that help like auto setting of time daily and indoor and outdoor temps. The only problem is that the base tends to lose contact with the outside sensor about once a week and requires resetting the main unit to pick it back up.
3,Surface efficient but....,"Pros: design looks nice, space efficient (takes not too much area from your night stand). Cons: setting clock alarms not intuitively, number display could be improved."
2,Dual Alarm means 1 for weekdays and 1 for 1 day only,I bought this specifically to have alarms that would go off twice a day (as I have had in the past on other atomic weather clocks). After getting the batteries in and setting all the functions I found that the alarm could be set for 1 time a day for the weekdays and then an alarm for 1 other time during the week. Now what good is that for people that don't work M-F or need an alarm that is used twice a day. As you can tell now I need to send it back and search for another one. Otherwise it looked nice and was not terribly hard to program and I did like that you could have 3 remote sensors and see different temp and humidity on them.
3,Not very durable,"After about half a year of use, the remote transmitter's temperature will no longer show up. Time to test this unit's warranty services."
4,Good range and information,Got 2 of these and have transmitter on each side of house. The connection was good and never lost it except when the batteries in one transmitter went dead. I ave the unit 50 feet from the transmitter and it works fine. Simple and easy to set up and can use 2 together on different frequency.
1,Having the same problem as the other 1 star guy,"This unit worked great for about 9 months, now it loses communication with the outdoor sensor? I've diagnosed it to the main unit , not the sensor. If I remove the batteries then re install them it'll work for a few hours , then go blank for the outdoor temp once again? I expected more from a name like Honeywell?"
4,Great little unit!,This is a slick little clock that we use in our truck camper. The temperature remote is in the fridge and very accurate after you put lithium batteries in it. My only beef about it is that it is hard to read at angles.
5,Fun!,"My kids love this saxoflute! There are lots of pieces that you can assemble in lots of different shapes. Cover and uncover the little holes and you'll play different notes. Helps the kids learn what affects the pitch. It comes with some pictures of possible layouts. The kids love copying them. We haven't had any pieces break yet, so I'd say they're nice and durable."
4,Loud and Fun for Two,"This is a hit with our boys, ages 2 and 3.5. They will actually play together, each with a mouth piece and a horn attachment. It is loud, but with our boys loud is the norm and anything that helps them play together without our help for an extended period (twenty minutes or so) is worth the noise. Thanks to the Super Saxoflute, the couch cushions and dog get a break while we get dinner on the table. We will be purchasing other Quercetti toys."
4,Fun Fun Fun,"My 3 yr old daughter loves. We bought it along with Querceti Tubation kit. To beginwith we helped making different shapes and made her blow the whiste/s. Now within 2-3 weeks, she has started connectin the tubes on her own. Here is a secret. I like to play with this tubation set.Only concern: Some tubes don't fit well.. free flowing. Makes it lil unyieldy"
4,Fun Toy,This toy is very fun and entertaining. I do notice that some of the pieces do not hold together as firmly as I would like.
5,Great Fun,This is made in Italy and a wonderful toy. What is more exciting than building your own instrument and then getting to play it. When they are created they look like something you would see in a Dr. Suess book. They are so much fun and compatible with Quercetti's Tubation set. You then can build even bigger and sillier instruments or build any amazing creation you can think up! These are also safe for houses with babies. The pieces are quite large!
3,Nice film and print in UK package,"""100 men and a Girl"" is the second film which catapulted teenage Deanna Durbin to superstardom in 1937. It is a brilliant showcase for the young star who plays with a self confidence and versatility rare in such performers. With her crystal clear pure singing voice, her natural warmth and charm and all the exuberance of youth, she was a natural. The only gripe is that her speaking voice is rather shrill here but in later films, this was clearly ""corrected"".The film is a depression fairy tale whereby young Deanna obtains work for 100 unemployed musicians via a wealthy benefactor, (marvellous Eugene Pallette) and superstar conductor Leopold Stokowsky, playing himself. The supporting cast are fine and the film is fast moving and amusing.The DVD is a British production (not for US regions), contains a good enough print and the only extra is a selection of on set shots. In the US, it is hideously expensive on Amazon but there are alternatives!"
1,Snooze Fest !,This album is only good if you have insomnia. It's boring to the nth degree. Better get the String Quartet Tribute to Janet Jackson or Madonna instead...
2,Video is Awful,Boring video that should be sold on the DVD for the same price. Good little summary that's outdated but I refuse to spend the money to buy a DVD where the quality is that bad.
1,Didn't work,"My wife is very sensitive to sleep aids (medical or ""natural). This didn't work at all for my wife and actually caused an allergic reaction (despite her not being allergic to anything listed on the product label). I called Source Naturals regarding some of their ""natural vitamins."" Learned that while they don't use GMOs, they do use some synthetics. Buyer beware."
3,Wish this had worked for me...,"The good: this supplement definitely helped me get to sleep.The bad: after a couple of weeks, I noticed I was groggy during the day and had trouble remembering things. I went back to straight melatonin and those issues disappeared."
2,"BIGGEST ""PILLS"" OUT THERE !","Night one: Worked great; almost gagged.Night two: Took 1 1/2 pills; didn't work, almost gagged.Night three: Took 2 pills, didn't work; gagged.These pills are HUGE HUGE !!! For my chemistry, the strongest thing I've ever tried is Sub=lingual Melatonin, ONE milligram, Source Naturals peppermint. Less is MORE with Melatonin. Trust me. I know sleeping pills."
5,Very Helpful,I have had insomnia for 30 years but I do not like to take medicine. If I have a night where I really can't fall asleep these help. I especially like this product because I usually sleep 5-6 hours straight. I don't feel groggy when I wake up.
5,Love this stuff,I have had real good luck with this as a way to settle in at night. I teach night classes and am often wound up in the evening. These help settle my brain down but I never feel sluggish in the a.m.
2,Not effective,"Source Naturals NightRest with Melatonin, 200 Tablets /bottle* Just received it less than a week ago. This is absolutely not effective for me. For 3 nights consecutively I took 1 tablet /night around 30 minutes before going to bed. Awake all the same without any sign of wanting to fall asleep. Fed up and have had to take other type of sleeping aid, by then its was almost wee hour. Thus the whole process could not help me at all. However, I have not tried to take 2 tablet /night yet. As I am reluctant to decide on taking more of it going to bed."
2,Simply didn't work for us,"I'm not giving this 2 stars for simply not *working* for us because everyone is different. I'm giving it only 2 stars because our friends love it but we saw literally no difference, even when two tablets were taken. Additionally, it was giving my husband very very bad stomach aches. He tried to take them two or three times for a week and the stomach aches arrived the day he took them and stopped happening the day he stopped taking them the next week."
2,ACCELERATED MY HEART RATE,"Night Rest accelerated my heart rate which is the exact opposite effect of what I needed. I recommend to try first with the fewest cap. bottle to see if its suitable for you. My second option was ""Knock-Out"" by Schiff and I didn't had any secondary effects with that one."
3,Night Rest Review,"It is not a bad product but I would not advise anyone to rush, beat the streets, the bushes and buy you up some either."
4,fun puzzle.,"this puzzle is really challenging and beautiful even though it is only 1000 pieces. Each piece is unique and fits perfectly. the only unlike is some fish is zoomed, result in really long weird shape. the fish is the yellow one at the top, the dolphins at the bottom, and the red one in the mid-bottom."
2,Not Good Enough,"Sound Quality Great,earbud comfort Great, Range Poor, Battery Life Poor, Recharge connector should be standard to be able to charge via car lighter."
3,"Just okay, not fantastic.","I've had some problems with static off and on when using it with my verizon phone and with my Ipod. It will also cut in and out on me, and or the sound will be garbled at times."
3,Oster blender,I was only in need of the cap on this which fit fine. The entire lid was smaller than my blender and would have need to be returned. Perhaps specifying the size would have helped.
4,Packed with information,"I really enjoyed this documentary. If you're a fan of the American Gangster series on BET, Gangland, Cocaine Cowboys etc you should also enjoy this. This is a fairly long doc that covers a lot of information about the city of Detroit, it's history and the drug gangs that inhabit it.Editing and audio were subpar and it's not a heavily stylized doc that features tons of music overlays and imagery, this movie is truely about the stories. Overall the film could be descibed as gritty but then again so is Detoit. This movie covers the topic of the most violent individuals, in Americas most violent city, during the most violent period in our countries history."
3,Wobbly front wheel,"This bike is very fun and attractive. However, it requires some expertise to put it together. It is packed with the front fork backwards to take up less space, so you need to turn it around before putting on the fender and wheel. There is nothing in the instruction booklet to explain this to you. Also, ours came with a very wobbly front wheel. I did some research on the internet and figured out how to true the wheel by tightening the spokes, and now the front wheel is straight and no longer wobbles. If you don't have much mechanical aptitude you might need some help putting it together, but other than that, it's a great bike!"
1,I Only Read It Because I Had To,The book is a book completely devoid of any sensible plot at all. The villain isn't tangible. The main characters are kids. The plot and characters are very boring and I only read it because it was a school assignment. Perhaps if it had covered the Oyster Wars...
3,Waterman's Boy,"Waterman's Boy is about a 10 year old boy who wants to be a waterman (a person who catches crabs, oysters, and fish) when he grows up. The only trouble is that the bay where he lives is being polluted and the fishing industry is failing. The boy stuggles to find out why this bay is being distroyed. In the end, the boy learns about the effects of chemicals on the enviroment, sticks up for his believes, and discovers what he is ment to do in life.This book has a very slow plot, not very much action. It wouls be great to read if you are interested in the enviroment or fishing. Overall, it was pretty good."
3,My Feelings About Waterman's Boy,"My feelings about the book were very adventorus and thrilling.The things that made the book exciting were The Crab Festival, the boatingtrips,and Matt and Ben finding the oil spill in the marsh in the harbor.Those are my feelings about the book."
1,fading sign,I've found that signs of this type are worthless after a short time when placed in the sun. They fad severely and quickly.
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this article in hopes of finding an intelligent discussion of the merits anddisadvantages, technically speaking, of grab sampling. To start with, I was never able to downloador print the article, just read it on line. But no loss, because the ""article"" is so nontechnicaland lame that it would not be worth the paper it was printed on anyway. Save your money."
3,Interesting Reading,"I bought this book for information on 429 and 460 engines (it includes 460 in big letters on the cover). The information on 429/460s especially the heads is weak, tables are partially complete and the casing numbers are inconsistant and sometimes just wrong. It would be foolish to buy parts based solely on this reference. There no material for 429/460 engines after 1975. For the price it is a good value, I just wish it was more accurate and complete."
2,Leaves a bit to be desired.,"This book is a wonderful source if you're looking for STOCK interchange info on FE or small-block motors. However, if you happen to be a fan of or are seeking information on the 429/460 (385 series) motors, I think you'll be disappointed. While almost entire chapters are dedicated to the FE motor family, more often than not the last 1 1/2 pages refer to the 429/460's. Sure, that wierd one-off NASCAR 427 motor is neat to look at, but you're highly unlikely to see one at the local swap meet. And even if you do, you probably don't want to buy it anyway, due to lack of aftermarket support. This book reads like an art museum guide, extolling the virtues (or lack) of obscure parts that we'll probably never see. Interesting, yes. Helping with building a performance motor for a street or strip car , no. Good coffee table book, but not recommended for the average info seeker."
2,Not useful after ~1980,"Even with a publishing date of 1999, most of the information is about pre-1980 Ford Engines. For anyone working on 1986 to 1995 Ford 302's there is little information. Many of the Spac. tables end prior to 1975. For me rebuilding a 1995 5.0L to a 1986 Mustang GT, not much help."
2,interchange with what,this book was a bunch of bs. its more of a parts description then parts interchange. it doesn't tell you barely anything about what parts can swap with what
3,interchangeable,"Always wanted to see what parts were interchangeable on your engine. This book has a lot of it. Sure, since it's original printing many of the numbers have changed (if you are going to buy them), but if you attempting to do a full restoration of your old Ford, this book could save your butt with the judges.The author references to many of the OEM numbers and casting numbers you find on engine parts. It is necessary to have the matching part numbers to get the original part for some ground up restorations on vehicles. It is a good reference book for restoration, but not much else. Most of the numbers have been now superseded with Service Numbers (replacement part numbers) which the judges at most shows frown upon. Although it might be an official Ford replacement part for the engine, if the numbers don't agree to the OEM numbers, points are taken off."
4,Extremely confortable,"These shoes are very confortable... The other downside is that I find them to be a bit warm, and since i live in the caribbean... But anyhow I wear them every week!"
1,"atrocious, had to turn it off","Starts innocuous enough, but once they get to Vegas it's one degenerative situation after another. Nothing funny that I saw. Furthermore, cheesiest depiction of Vegas ever, they didn't even bother to shoot on location, but created tacky sets. Nothing redeeming, shame on Matthew."
2,Damaged,"It was damaged with scratches, Finders were bent. Bolts were missing and I had to buy new one's for it to be riden."
2,J. W.,"The cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places, which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and/or inept handling by the shipping company. A fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched. The front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire. A required tool, a 5mm allen wrench, was not provided. I have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated, however, the bike seems to perform adequately as is."
3,Nice bike for the money,"The bike is a good all purpose road bike. Would have rated higher, but the instructions for assembly are not good."
1,Do not recommend this cycle,The following were the problems:1. Bent fender - poor packaging2. Sratches in paint in several areas3. Three nuts were missing4. The front wheel hub had lateral play - cannot be fixedPlanning to return cycle if amazon accepts it.
3,Bicycle,"Color was green not the black I ordered.It came scratched and wheels were out of ""tru"" like box had been dropped hard several times, brakes were out of adjustment and can not get adjsuted without paying at a bike shop.Speed of arrival was fantastic."
3,Good reentry bike,"I am 66 and purchased this bike as a way of resuming bike riding. It served the purpose well. I found it relatively easy to assemble, though it took some time to adjust the fenders so they did not rub. It was comfortable to ride. I live in flat county so I seldom used all seven gears, but they were nice to have when the wind was occasionally at my back. The gears generally shifted well but occasionally slipped from one to another. I used it for approximately nine months before it was stolen. I learned that I still enjoy riding a bike and I'm am replacing it with a somewhat more expensive model."
2,Rim got bented,"I got this bicycle, and I assembled it. After I assembeld it, I was trying to ride on the bicycle, but I felt that the wheel was not smooth. So, I looked it, and the rim got bented, therefore brake kept reach.At first time, I thought that it was a brake problem, so I fixed a gap between a rim and a brake.However, it was not a problem. Rim was bented. So, now what? I have to go to a bike shop to fix it.There are also a dent and a scratch."
2,"An interesting, humourous 'discussion'.","It is difficult to write a review --something which tends to be concrete and objective-- about a book which takes as a basic premise the escape of both rigid modes of analysis! Patrick Henry's ""Companion"" is an interesting book, from all angles: whether Christian or otherwise. His insights into the 'irony' of Christian life and God's grace in the world are interesting, though they tend to speak less of ""finding the marks of God's grace in the world"" (from the title) than finding the author's own 'looking-back' interpretations of the events in his life. Perhaps they are connected, perhaps one and the same; and that idea is, in a way, one of Henry's main points. This is an entertaining book, if nothing else, and what may be found objectionable in the author's theology is offset with his own humour and anecdote."
2,Contradictory Philosophy,"This book is a continuous barrage of opinions from Patrick Henry, whose philosophy seems to be that ""nothing is certain except the fact that nothing is certain,"" which is intellectual relativism. The good thing about the book is its style. As a sort of journal of lessons learned in life, it would be interesting even to someone who disagrees. I would like to see more books out there that take that approach, but I hope that future authors view their work as an addition to the existing 2000 years of Christianity, rather than a modification of it."
3,The Ironic Christian's Companion,"It's somewhat entertaining. Perhaps the ideal book for those who are of a liberal bent and who pursue ""Christianity Lite"" and enjoy pschobabble. I found very little solid foundation based upon Bible scripture. On the other hand, Mr. Henry provides us with much worthwhile food for thought."
3,My son loves it but odd ending,"This is similar to the tortoise-and-hare story but with an odd twist which doesn't entirely make sense to me. It's basically old car versus new car in a race, only at the end, the slow old car gets pulled over by a police officer who congratulates him on his great driving (and meanwhile, the new car drives by and wins the race). But the old car is happy because he ""won the praise."" It's nicely written and has lovely pictures, but I still can't get over the ending.My 3yo loves it, however, and wants it read most nights, though I'm not sure he really understands the moral of the story (which I'm still trying to understand myself). Kids understand that ""winning the race"" is good; I'm not sure they can pick up the subtleties of: ""praise can be better than winning."""
5,My Favorite book,This was my favorite book growing up. Unfortunately it was located at my grandmother's house and I was only able to read it once a year. This is great adaptation of the tortoise and the hair. At the time it was considered a modern interpretation. Now the cars etc are dated which lends to the story.I had to give this to my god son.
5,Good product,This works great for taping my feet and the price is very good. It has made all the differences in getting over the Planter F. It comes on time and just in time...great product. Highly recommended by my family.
3,Only the fundamentals,"The Fundamentals bit of the title suits this book well... The range of subjects the book covers is adequate, and it is visually attractive and very clear all the time, but this is achieved sacrificing the depth and detail some topics deserve (for instance, integrated circuits technologies). The exercises the book provides are too easy all the time, and that is a disadvantage for the serious engineering student."
1,Condition Misleading,"Received the book quickly; however, the book was listed in ""Good"" condition which is misleading. The corners of the book look like a dog has chewed them. Multiple pages in the book are filled with writing. Condition is closer to a 4 out of 10 and I feel the condition should have been listed as ""Acceptable"". Although the shipping was expediant I wouldn't recommend purchasing from this user nor will I purchase from them in the future"
3,tbr,"I am currently re-reading it, as all the other books i rewieved when it came to my attention my rewievs may have been inaccurate.pls don`t vote on this and pls come back and read my upcoming rewiev."
3,"Well written, but not teeming with examples","This book is of a high standard and is very well written, but I found that there isn't a great number of examples of theory in here, because the theory is covered by complete matches rather than the fragments that matter. This reduces the educational value, in my opinion."
5,Topical and a great buy,"I do not expect this review to be seen at this point, due to the length of time of publication, but, here goes anyway. As of now (2011) there is a series of books by Everyman on a Move by Move theme. Years ago, this book came out. It stands on an equal platform with the Everyman series. With the very first game, one learns at least five lessons that are valuable. ON THE VERY FIRST GAME! The concept of a move by move book is to slow it down, to show the themes of every move. This book is a great example of this. A must buy, for those who are at the club level who need a slow process of explanations, that every 2100 + level player goes through by instinct."
1,"Uncomfortable, and sits too high on the back","This is the worst backpack I've ever owned. The straps don't seem to fit correctly on the back - probably due to the built-in handle - which make it extremely uncomfortable for long rides. Also, the roll top is too high, and I can't see anything behind me unless i turn my entire body, which doesn't feel safe.On the plus side, I have no doubt it's waterproof, and the pack itself seems all made, though the straps seem pretty cheap to me."
3,The Vets will leave it/The Newbies will take it!,"Ok I feel this is how it should be I have owned the cd for a few days and got the feel to it And I have been a fan since the 4ad stuff has been around. Yes over 15 years! I feel david is right and there will be others to agree. Yes it is a best of and yes Ronny forgot the Two other albums to include Phoenix and Twist of shadows. And yes to some degree there was a problem with him doing tracks from those albums. And as for the new versions! Stranger that stunk! Louise was ok, A-day was terrible. And the others I will end it at that. Ronny It is really time to hang it up. As for the newbies who love the album that is fine they can love it. But the true die hard fans will agree. Some things are to be left alone! You get the best of Both worlds. Good and Bad!"
3,Fair,"Out of curiosity I purchased this best-of collection and unfortunately can't say that I was greatly impressed. Don't get me wrong however, this is quite good music for its genre which is, I guess, called dark wave. I would highly recommend this album to fans of darkwave or melancholy electronica in general. However the only stand out tracks for me were the 2 pre 1990's songs ""a day"" and ""louise""... everything else on this compilation just seemed too derivative. Clan of Xymox sound as though Andrew Eldritch of the Sisters of Mercy and Martin Gore of Depeche Mode got together to make a German Industrial album of love songs... which would be great if it hadn't been done a million times already. Meh."
2,Love Hate situation,"I don't really want too say i hate this album,but i don't really like it either.Being a fan of Xymox for quite sometime now i just don't understand what really is going on here.All of the songs on this album should have just been left alone.I didn't really see the point of remixing or re-recording any of these.Personally in my opinion the live album is a best of,this is just another sale in Ronny's pocket.One more thing i can't understand is how the hell tracks from Notes from the Underground and Farewell made it on a ""best of"" is beyond me.Okay they were supposedly picked by fans but come on,those are in no way ""best of"" songs."
2,The Best of Sadness and sweet sorrow! Ronny sad Chronicles,Fan for 18 years and I have heard ok best of lineups and some bad line ups. The new re-recorded tracks were the old with the new Beeps and Tweeks that go Bleepers in the dark. Back door was my fav let alone Louise but they were lost and I dunno the other two were not quite good enough. I mean You have to be a true fan to understand and the Vets like The prophet and David I dunno seem right and yes I feel the newbies would love it. COX Founder has run out of ideas. Ronny little advice when you want to put out something new and have it do good or better then the other albums never talk trash about the U.S.
3,Best Of Ended Long Ago....,"I agree with Robert. The best music that this band released was with the original clan of Ronny, Anke, and Peiter. Newer material is unoriginal and uninspired. On a good note, the cover-art for this album is stunning."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING! WHERE ARE IMAGINATION, OBSESSION, AT THE END OF THE DAY??? HIS VOICE IS GETTING DARKER AND DARKER... REALLY HATED THIS!"
5,One of the best gothic bands ever!,"I was really surprised to hear about this Best of Cd! Even though I already own everything they've ever recorded, I will still buy this cd. It's a great compilation of most, but not all, of their different time periods and style changes. It will be nice to have this representation from most of their albums. I find Xymox to be great evening driving music! They never disappoint and it will take you back if you used to go clubbing in the 80's and early 90's. Many of the early tracks were staples then. I'm sure Ronny and the gang will be around for a long time and I'll still be listening to these songs when I'm 80!"
5,Tell the audiophiles yours is better.,"This is a quality piece of equipment. Many entry and mid-level ""audiophile"" turntables are nothing but MDF with a motor glued on. They reek of cheap, but they are the hallowed belt drive systems that supposedly offer vinyl Nirvana... after $500 worth of upgrades. Audiophiles sniff at the Technics and call it a DJ table, and, in truth, it is popular with DJs because it's almost indestructible. But it makes a great Hi-Fi table as well.I recently bought a 1210 (black) with some KAB upgrades and it literally sings. Put a good cartridge in it (AT 150 MLX, or a Grado Gold), do a proper set up and sit back and enjoy the music.I should have bought one of these years ago."
4,Excellent for the price,"Fully user-adjustable if you like to tweak, easy switching of headshells, solid and well-made, rock-steady platter, and...most important of all, somehow quieter than any belt drive turntable I've heard. Let's the cartridge speak for itself. IMO, A-T and Denon cart.s are the ones to use with this.One star taken off since if it had auto-return and maybe a straight tonearm it would be perfection."
5,The Rolls Royce of Turntables,"The standard which all others turntables are judged~! PERIOD!! Belt driven are good but direct drive been around for ages... Besides, audiophiles claim that belt driven tables are the best but??? Don't let that ""opinion"" stop you from purchasing this awesome TT..."
4,works as advertised,"It is slightly challenging to get the pieces out in once piece, but it works as well as it can. As long as you take it slow and are careful, it should work as well as advertised. I have the chess piecers that go with it and they fit nicely."
4,Whitley being Whitley,"I love the way Whitley compresses it all into one volume that won't chew a hole in your wallet. This is not the last word in battleship references, but it's among the best first words you can find. The one weakness is in its illustrations. Modelers can pass this one by. The line drawings look like the author did them himself, out of necessity--which is actually the case. And there are no armor schematics. However, Whitley goes beyond where other references (like Conway's) grind to a halt, and he goes to the trouble of describing the armor layout rather than simply slapping statistics onto the page. What it lacks in detail, it makes up for with its handiness and broad scope. I'm aware of its limitations, especially where the author was trying to pry information out of Russian and Japanese sources, but I find myself getting plenty of use out of it."
2,Awfully brief for an Encylcopedia,"M. J. Whitley does his best to describe the world's capital ships of the WWII era but just does not devote enough material to adequately cover the rebuilt ships from the WWI era, the new designs laid down and completed in the 1930's and 1940's, and the designs planned but not laid down or completed. As with his book on Aircraft Carrier Development, the line drawings are crude and not particuarly accurate. Mr. Whitley includes descriptions of the Soviet dreadnoughts laid down in 1938-39-40 (Sovietskii Soyuz class) but indicates nothing about the U. S. Montana class, which were the first US design to be wider than the locks of the Panama Canal. Overall, the material contained here can be found to much better effect in other references."
4,Tom Petty Playback,"I bought this after reading ""Conversations With Tom Petty"". I really like TP & the HBs and have every album/CD, so it's no surprise that I quite enjoy this set too. Fun hearing different takes on songs I know and hearing new material as well. Perfect for the TP fan-"
3,Ok .... But Not Great,If i had to do it again I would stick to the albums... Lots of this stuff has been so overplayed ( not Tom's fault) that it goes in one ear and out the next...The oddities are ok but not mind blowing... That Tom has come up with so many great songs is testament to his remarkable ablilties as an artist... To have so many back to back is just a bit numbing... Best to buy the albums you like and enjoy the songs as they were intended... as part of a whole....
2,Very expensive delivery!,"The actual D.V.D. is okay and fulfilled the requiremnts that I wanted it for. However, it is contained in a very slim case.The actual D.V.D. quality is okay only.Goin Coconuts as a film is fun and fine for Donny and Marie fans. The accompanying film is very poor and is a poor accompaniment to Goin Coconuts.The real bugbear is the cost of shipping for such an inexpensive film - I'm certain it could have been done cheaper."
5,rock salsa kings,if you like this record wait until you hear their new one that will be released early next year. the new music is more latin flavored and made for dancing and groovin.
2,Theses guys don't know a Mambo from a Mamba,"Low-buget, b-studio, unfinished, poorly produced, also-ran effort by ""the next big thing."" Might be more impressive if it actually was an indie record and not a major label outing. One thing I will give them credit for is the beat. Nothing too ground breaking, but your toes will tap as you try to stomach Alfalfa, I mean Potz, or whatever dumb name the singer goes by. And what's with the Van Halen guitar? Are you serious? Santana had Carlos. Sublime had Brad. The Wailers had Bob Marley. You get the theme here? They obviously don't. Pick it up at a $.99 used bin near you and save the postage for a..."
1,Misrepresented Quality,"Quality of packaging far exceeds the quality of the product. The ""Heavy Duty"" fan is noisy and will barely blow a piece of paper around. The wires are so small it was difficult to connect to the power leads. Badly misrepresented in it's description!!"
3,Works but noisy,The item was received quickly and installed easily. Fan works and the 2 speeds function normally. So I'd say the item works as promised. The down-side is that the new fan is significantly noisier then the original and obviously not made to the same high standards. I intend to leave the new fans in while I figure out a way to rebuild/lubricate the old fans.
1,Did not last 3 hours!!!!!,"My husband intstaled these fans (which I gave to him as a birthday present) in our motorhome. On our next trip out the fans worked ok not great but ok, but after 3 hours of running started to have a bearing noise. And became so noisey we had to turn them off. We have have sence replace them with better fans at a cost of $4.00 more. It is our opinon the money spent for these fan was a waste!"
4,nice fan price could be 5$ lower and it would be a great deal,its a decent fan i use it in my shed with a solar set up to move air around it worked fairly well hooked directly up to an Npower 18 watt solar cell on highspeed i have a 103 watts total of solar power atm its a little load on high on low you can barely hear it and still moves a fair amount of air on high i felt it blowing at 12 ft nicely its made of all metal yes but its a thin gauge sheet metal has a 7 inch blade roughly it will do most jobs well and fit most applications where a small fan is needed
1,Road Pro 12 volt fan,Service from Amazon was fine but disappointed with fan performance. Two out of three fans did not work properly.
4,Family Similarities.,"This short kiddy book uses pictures and illustrations from the first 5 STAR WARS films to display the lifestyle similarities between the Skywalkers: Anakin and Luke, Padme and Leia, Luke and Leia. The book is really short, but is fun to look through especially if you are or know a young STAR WARS fan."
2,a major misstep,"Having read Wallace's other material, I think it would be best if he stopped writing about Ashland completely. The characters in this book are just too simple to have any believability to them. The first part of this book is well-written and Wallace always has a knack for some great imagery. Nonetheless, this book just did not involve me like his others."
5,Impossible to put down,"I've read Daniel Wallace's last two books, and I think The Watermelon King is his best, even better than Big Fish, which I heard was being made into a movie by Tim Burton. The Watermelon King takes stock Southern characters-- the village idiot, the old man with stories-- and turns them on their heads by making them the heroes. Daniel Wallace's writing is always funny and sad at the same time, and in this book, it's also pretty absorbing and much more risky. I highly recommend this book to people who like something a little different, funny, and moving."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this book. It had a good premise, and the interview section was intriguing. However, I felt the dialogue, and character development fell short once the book reached part two. An excellent storyline, but I felt the book was too short to fully explore it. I will read other work by Daniel Wallace in the future. I hope it is merely the case that this is not his best work, because the piece had so much potential."
3,TR-670,"My old tuner of 35 year died so selected this one.It does the job. Signal capture is good.Cons are not very important fidelity-wise, but I think:- unit has far too many presets, must be a hundred, so you have to key in multiple number keys (how many can YOU remember?)- re phantom energy, it would be nice to have option to not have a clock shining.I do want to end by saying it does do a good job at what I paid it for - to listen to the radio.M."
5,Excellent performance at reasonable price,"My SONY FM tuner developed lots noise in listening to stations, so I began searching a replacement. I was concerned if I could ever find a component tuner. I was very pleased to find this TEAC model at Amazon. The sound is superb with 30 preset stations! Personally I think it has really pushed the envelope with so many presets. It was easy to use and set up. I am very satisfied with its performance and its price."
5,Very pleased,"Oddly enough I still like to tape certain shows off FM radio. Just got this tuner. Very simple setup. Very clear sound - but not harsh. Beats the tar out of my (admittely low priced) Pioneer receiver's tuner. I have owned nice equipment before (ex: Cambridge Audio). I decided I wanted a * good * (dammit) but affordable tuner. This exactly fits my needs.Storing channels is a piece of cake. The remote is sort of a frill and a bonus at this point. It may be that I come to rely on it. Tuner has a sleep mode, hmmm could be useful for some. While there's no tuning strength meter, once you are on the exact frequency two different red indicators appear: Stereo, Tuned.P.P.S. If you want to rack mount it, I think there's rack mount ears available separately for it. Either that or you can buy one of those Middle Atlantic rack trays and take the feet off the unit, vecro the bottom of it to the tray - it works."
4,Initial thoughts about the Teac TR-670 AM/FM tuner,"The TR-670 replaces a tired Denon analog AM/FM tuner in use since 1983. The programming of the Teac tuner is not quite intuitive and, sadly, the manual lacks important details. Nevertheless, the sound quality is just fine, and some users will find the tuner's clock feature useful. The audio output level from the Teac tuner is considerably greater than the Denon's, and the digital tuning protocol eliminates the issue of frequency drift. There is clearly one aspect concerning the Teac tuner I like least: In my application, power to the tuner and associated electronics in my recording studio control room is shut down at night. If power is removed from the tuner, it does not come back on when power is returned; it must be manually switched on. This is a quibble, I agree, and those who need to purchase a component AM/FM tuner will be more than satisfied with the TR-670's performance."
2,"Potential was there, but","I was very disappointed - the characters were not well constructed. Gordon's relationship between his wife and father-in-law was weak, but apparently important. The first SEAL mission in the Mideast was interesting, but lead nowhere. Riker introduces Oliver North as a character, describes a high intensity mission, and does nothing to link its outcome to the main plot aboard the Pittsburgh.Biker bar rumbles, switchblades, beer-maidens with a heart of gold, the Big C..... it was pretty tiresome testosterone with no focus. I enjoy the submarine/SEAL genre and there are some great stories to weave, unfortunately, Riker missed the boat on this one."
4,Have to buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Love the way H. Jay Riker marry the Seal Team and the Superb SILENT SERVICE together. Although it is bit slow moving, it is interesting to read many aspect of the Submarine life of a person living in it. Those who had read the previous Grayback Class book, will either love it or hate it. I simply love both of them. It this book center around, the LOS ANGELES CLASS Submarine, SSN 720 Pittsburgh. Displacement standard, tons:6082 Displacement dived, tons:6927 Length, feet:362 Beam, feet:33Draught, feet:32.3 Speed, knots: 32 dived. One of the most fearsome underwater manmade machine as it pitt itself against the enermy. Love the author way of telling you Naval jargons and then follow up by explaining, the way he create a charactor, give him a background and then LIFE. So dun wait, go get it!!!!!!!!!"
2,Los Angeles Class,"Although the book contains a relatively engaging story, I was severely disappointed in some of the flaws in technical details. One that jumps out in my mind is the statement that certain classes of Russian submarines had an advanced aluminum hull. It has been common civilian knowledge since the mid 1980's that this class of submarine in fact had a titanium hull. Aluminum is not a suitable material for submarine construction. Had the author done ANY research he would have known this. I have never stepped foot on a nuclear submarine and was able to pick out several technical details that were incorrect just based on my previous research of the topic. I can only imagine how many flaws would be found by a real submariner.I have a few other books by the author that I have not yet read, perhaps this book was just a fluke. It is an entertaining story, I was just disappointed at the apparently lack of research conducted before writing."
4,Another Fine read from Rendell,"I have never read a boring book by Ruth Rendell. This one centers on a quiet and unnoticed psychopath. As she often does, Rendell places two stories side by side, and brings them together in a mind-blowing resolution. Here, the story of one man's romance with a woman married to a violent mate, and a psychopath brought to the edge by seemingly tiny cirucmstances. It may be a bit schematic - two men who coinicdentally have the same first initial and last name, a woman who leaves her violent husband just as the other story has reached a climactic crisis - but it is so much fun, so imaginative and not-quite-predictable, and such a fitting reader-revenge - that it is forgiveable.It does seem: you can always count on Rendell."
4,This one won't disappoint,"Imagine my delight as a hard-core Rendell fan when I discovered a book that I had never read! Lonely Arthur Johnson is about to lose control of his carefully built defenses against his tendency to violence. If the first two pages of this book don't grab you, nothing will. Demon in My View is another voyage into the unexpected from the Grand Master of psychological suspense. It is not the very best of Rendell, but just a notch below."
5,A breathtaking novel,"Ruth Rendell is unquestionably the best novelist in this, or any generation. Her stories of psychological suspense and downright sheer chillingness will, and deserve to, go down in history as some of the most artful novels ever written. And this, is one of her very very best.The atmosphere is chilly and hostile, the plot and characters are disturbing and strange. She mixes the normal everyday tpicalities of life with the quirks in the mind of the mentally...different, brilliantly, so that the consequences are amazingly cathartic.Disturbing, compelling, utterly absorbing, with a shock ending that is a masterpiece of irony, this is an amazing novel."
4,Psychological Thriller--4 1/2 star quality,"This small book starts out slowly but soon picks up speed such that you can hardly wait to see what will happen. It has some dark but subtle comedic elements too--especially with the two characters named A. Johnson. It seems more thriller than mystery--certainly not a whodoneit. The psychological elements are very interesting if you are into psychology--especially the method of coping with the central pathology. It does have a number of problematic coincidences--especially two related ones at the very end. I could almost guess the final one. Still, it was a satisfying book, my first Rendell too. I shall read more."
2,Java Data Objects made complicated,"I can usually comprehend and apply new technologies very quickly. I read this book and JDO still has me baffled. In my 7 year, Java career, having worked with many large companies, I have been exposed to many homegrown persistence APIs. I though that through these experiences, learning JDO would be simple. I keep waiting for the author to apply parts of the JDO spec to concepts and challenges to which I have become familiar. The author lost me early. He failed to mention how JDO solved common problems developers face while persisting Java objects to XML or RDBMS. I still don't know how JDO handles composite primary keys, or many to many joins. This is one of those rare cases where the spec may be easier to understand that the explanation of the spec."
1,Terrible!,"Things done wrong from the very begining when the author put outhis first example, and failed to show the realationship betweenthe property file entry and the database underneath, and how all things work together. The writting is overly complicated too (reminds me of Mr. Don Box's writting on DCOM)In summary, this book teaches you nothing about the JDO. it only confuse the heck out of you. I left it on the table in the bookstore. terrible, just plain terrible!"
1,steer clear,"I wish I could give it half a star, and that would be strictly for aesthetics. the unit is small and does look pretty slick, but that's where it ends. This is the main problem: at some point, the unit stops reading discs. At first this happens with CDRs & CDR-Ws, but the problem quicly spreads to all CDs. I've owned it for two years, and have sent it twice to Teac for repair (it comes with a two year warranty). My warranty has now worn out and guess what? It not only has stopped reading discs once again, but it also does not respond to any commands from either the remote or the front pannel. It won't even turn off unless it is unplugged.On top of it all, (when working) it is very noisy when switching between discs. Also, be aware that the shuffle mode will not work between discs. It will only shuffle tracks among one disc at a time...."
1,Horrible CD player... it will break on you.,My parents bought this CD player with the matching tuner. It seems they were lucky and it actually lasted two years. The warranty ran out and it stopped playing CDs. Actually to be fair...it will play about 10 min of a CD and then starts skipping around wildly. Avoid this defective product.
1,Shame on you Teac,"I can't agree more with the previous review about the poor quality of the CD player. It has been serviced three times during warranty, and no big surprise, that after the warranty ended, it stopped working again. It basically ""freezes"" up and stops dead. Apparently, the technology and inner workings of this CD were not figured out correctly prior to production. After the fourth time, I returned it to Teac directly, paid $165 for repair to have a new mechanism put in, and 9 months after, it stopped working again. What a disappointment. Especially, that it is a perfect match to the Teac tuner which works perfectly."
2,A Little Thin on Content,"Normally, the Arthur series of educational CDs for children are enjoyable, educational and engaging. It was for this reason that I purchased this CD for my 6 year old child. However, when we recived it, the ""Thinking Games"" turns out to have only 5 or 6 activities, and no automatic leveling (where the CD challenges the child when the child correctly completes an activity. Further, the games that are used seem more like arcade activities, with very little actual ""thinking"" necessary on the part of the child. While my child enjoys it, I would much rather have them playing with Arthur's First or Second Grade CDs which are challenging, interesting and multifacited. As both the ""grade"" CDs and the ""Thinking Games"" CDs are the same price, go for the grade ones -- you will get a lot more for your money!"
2,Extremely Disappointing from an Arthur Fan,"Like other reviewers, I find this game to have very little educational content..or content period. My sons (2 and 3) tire quickly of its few games, and really just enjoy the regurgitating sound the garbage can makes in the painting section.Save your money for better quality games."
4,Great for 3-5 yr olds.,"I bought this cd for my niece and nephew about ten years ago. Both liked it, especially my niece. Now my grandchildren are using it, ages 3 and just-turned-five. It is good for teaching them mouse control and how to navigate a page with directions. It has some critical thinking skills in the hide and seek game as well as the maze. It has some creativity in the ""painting"" of stage sets. It also has a bit of sight reading with the jeopardy type game.I did not really want a cd that had too much on it for a three year old to navigate. It suits its purpose just fine for me!"
1,Not for MacOS,"We just purchased this and recived a version that is NOT compatible with the MacOS. Perhaps there are newer versions that work with the Mac, but be aware that some of the used ones may NOT be Mac compatible."
5,A must have reference for ALL digital design engineers,"After ploughing through this book, I found it to be a treasure trove of useful information. It's well layed out, and well explained. As with their first ""black magic text"", it's full of helpful hints, guides, and rule'o'thumbs that will get you up to speed quickly so you can apply them and get expected results from your design. Well done Mr Johnson and Mr Graham, another excellent reference!"
1,"This book is OK, if you are a three year old.","I found this book to be properly detailed, but way too silly for my taste. The author's style is whimsical and folksy that I found to be too junvenal for me. If he had stripped out all the silliness and gotten right to the point I would have been more satisfied. But, I'm over 50 so maybe it's just me."
4,My favorite water pill.,I've tried several brands of water pills. Natrol is my favorite brand that works better than the others. Amazon's price is great.
3,Okay water pill.,"This is an okay water pill. It is not anywhere near a prescription strength water pill. The instructions say that you should take 2 pills once per day, but not for more than 5 consecutive days. The pills are medium to large size, about the size of a small multi-vitamin."
1,Nope. Nothing. Nada.,"I was hoping I'd get good results with this product with the great reviews, but no luck whatsover.The first time I tried this pill, I have to admit I was a little gassy. So since I was unsure of whether water bloat or gas bloat was my problem that day, I couldn't really accuse the pills of doing nothing. So I tried them again on a day I was not gassy at all, and it did nothing again...no additional trips to the bathroom to indicate it was having any effect whatsoever, and no reduction whatsoever in bloating - a complete waste of money IMO."
2,bulb,Product wasn't correct and it just wasn't worth sending it back . So I just threw it away. It could have been my fault.
2,Disappointed,When my bulb in my Scorpion Streamlight blew I put one of these bulbs in. It did not fit in the light as it should and would not work after it was installed. Would not buy again.
4,Pleased rider,"Came promptly and in good shape.Having some (remote) experience with bicycle assembly, getting it in riding shape was not too hard and the directions were good. The hard part was determining which directions went with the purchased model.Riding has been a pleasure for this casual recreational rider."
3,"Looks good, BUT!!","Bike really came quickly, but packaging wasn't great. Some minor scratches and dents. THANK GOODNESS I had a friend who is a real bike fanatic. After much adjusting of rear wheel for whobble, and problems with the rear brakes, I finally took a ride. I love the way the bike looks and rides, but if I didn't have a friend!! I would never have gotten it together. Novice bikers beware!"
4,Great Overall Deal,"I am so pleased with my new bike. I'm 32 and it has been several years since I have done any cycling, but I'm determined to find interesting ways of getting my 10 month old daughter out and about. The bike was easy enough to put together. My husband & I put it together without any fights (and only a couple misleading instructions from the bike booklet). My front fender was slightly bent in transit, but I can cope. It's comfy, easy to adjust and takes the baby bike trailer with no complaints. Just the right price to aid my re-entry into cycling."
2,Would have been beter off going garage sale/vintage,"My friend and I both purchased this bike. The bike was easy to put together, but the decals were falling off when I took it out of the box. The instruction manual is in no readable order. Both bikes had to have the gears worked on to stop them from trying to shift contstantly without the shift knob being touched at all.Over all, I'm not happy and i think I could have done better buying a second hand bike."
4,Bend tire frame due to shipment (I assume),"Got all parts of the bike when shipped; took about 45 minutes to put it together. The frame of the tire was bend, wheel wobbled, and the uneven part of the wheel thrusted against the brakes. Took it to a bike shop to fix that and put some air in the tires for $13. Over all a cool bike if you like the retro look, I also bought a basket and a traditional bell for the front; drove it for about 4.5 hours today, so far so good!"
4,evaj,"Overall the bike is fine. Very traditional design, exactly as I wanted.Could be lighter. Too heavy tires."
1,The bike did not assemble correctly,The bike did not assemble correctly. The wheel touches something and there is a drag when I ride the bike. Tried a cycle shop and they said it would cost me to fix it. so this is lying in my garage unused.
5,Love it,"I bought this bike over a year ago and it still works perfectly. I attempted to build it myself but that was an ultimate fail. I ended up just taking it to my local bike shop and they assembled it for me, they did a full tune up and it was $70. I've compared prices in stores to bikes similar to this one and the total cost with the tune up is still cheaper than most places. Since then I've had zero issues with it and I ride it regularly on the road, sidewalk, and park-grounds. I've had to put air in the tires a few times but I think that's normal. Overall I love it. Every time I ride it at least one person shouts that they love it or ask me where I got it."
2,Not unhappy but not happy either,"Pacific cruiser was very easy to put together but the decals don't lay flat on the frame. Almost like there bubbling. Also the gears are really hard to set up. After hours of adjusting I still can't get the top gear and the low gear. Now I feel like I gave my wife a cheep mothers day gift cause it doesn't work like it should. Now I have to go and spent the money to have this part of the bike replaced. If I were you I'd spend more money and get something with a better gear shift, and I think the main problem with this bike is the rear derailleur (part that moves the chain in and out so it changes gears). Happy bike hunting. Wish I could do it over."
3,"Bike ok, arrived with cut tire","Bike seems ok, assembled without needing any instrictions. Good options for adjusting to rider's build. Only irating issue is that that the front tire had a cut in it (from assembly at factory). This prevented my daughter from riding it until I purchased a new tire tube from the store. She was disappointed not being able to ride it on her birthday."
1,Disappointing quality,Quality and ease of assembly are disappointing. Fenders came bent and rub tires (I just removed them); brakes are difficult to adjust; chain pops off and gears need adjusting. I am left with decision of returning or paying local bike shop to repair...My frustration increased by fact tha this same bike was retailed at loacl HEB Plus store for less than $90.00!
2,Cute is not enough,"Due to such poor packaging, one of the wheels was slightly bent and one of the fenders was even more bent out of shape. Both the front and back brakes do NOT work as they should. The front brakes do not fully release back to their starting position after squeezing the handle bar brake so then it rubs against the tire unless you reach down and manually adjust the brakes away from the tire. The back brakes look as if they work fine until you go to ride the bike. The back brakes did not stop me whatsoever. If they were all I had to rely on, I'd be in serious trouble.Bottom Line: It's a very cute beach cruiser style bike at a great price BUT I wish I would have spent a little more money for a better quality bike. Pay the extra cash for a safer, better quality ride everyone!!!"
3,bike review,"The instructions weren't that easy to follow, so I needed assistance to put it together. Once I got it together it was a little wobbly to ride as if it weren't balanced. It was a nice bike all in all."
3,Way too small for tall people or people with long legs.,"I ordered this bike thinking it would be big enough for me. I'm 5'9"" and thought that it would be big enough. I couldn't be more wrong. With the seat all the way up, my knees still get caught on the handlebars. Its a very cute bike and I would recommend this model...as long as your under 5'6"" tall!"
2,decent bike,"you get what you pay for with this bike. it looks ok but feals very cheap. the chain guard and fenders have to be bent into place due to poor packaging, they are made out of very thin sheet metal so its easy to bend. the only things that need to be installed or tightened down are the seat, handle bars and neck, pedals, fenders, and the front wheel. i also needed to adjust brakes. it rides nice but i doubt it will last more than a couple years without needing a chain or spockets or crank bearings. i wouldn't be suprized if the fork bent on this thing too, just from normal riding. thanks china!"
4,Good deal!,I recently got this bike for my birthday. I love the colour and find the handlebars nice and wide which makes it comfortable to ride. I'm happy with the bike and recommended it to a friend. It is perfect for around our hamlet and some recreational biking. I do not find the seat very comfortable though and I'm going to switch it out. My husband assembled it. We are having problems with the back breaks; they aren't working quite right yet. One fender came with a small dent from shipping but I think a few dents are to be expected. I was excited when it arrived sooner than the website predicted.
2,BEWARE of Amazon Shipping Practices,"If you order ANY bike from Amazon, Beware of the Shipping Damage. AMAZON has a contract with FEDEX that states FEDEX is not responsible for any Damages caused by shipping, and you have to take it up with AMAZON. This Means they can Smash it, and tell you ""tough luck Call Amazon""Call amazon and its the run around, ship it back 3- 4 weeks to look at it, a week to ok it, another couple weeks to replace it, and it comes via the same truck and driver that brought the fist one with the same answer.. sorry its mashed.. take it up with AMAZON.. go back to square one with are you sure it was damaged by shipping, etc.Go visit a bike shop.. do not buy one from Amazon, unless you like buying a new damaged Bike."
2,Not worth it! Keep looking.,"The bike was sratched to the metal in several places,the fenders were dented badly, the nuts and bolts were loose in the box and there were broken pieces of plastic in there.I would not purchase this bike again."
4,"""Late"" Mother's Day Present","I purchased this bike for my 50+ year old mother. Bike took about an hour or so to assemble by just following the directions and thinking through the parts that I didn't understand. She enjoys riding the bike, but since it is a cruiser bike it did take a little getting use to. She wanted a cruiser bike so she wouldn't have to lean forward while riding and put pressure on her back. The only parts that needed tweaking were the brakes and the gear shifter. They just needed some loosening of some screws and tightening or slacking of the wires.All-in-All, I am very satisfied with this bike and my mother loves it."
3,NICE PROODUCT - SLOPPY PARTS DELIVERY,"Nice product, but..... Several screws were missing in the box. A part for the front fenders is missing. The ""manual"" is ""generic"" for many (other kind!) of bikes. Instructions poor at best! We still like the product but the seller has to do a better job delivering what you expect....Again, made in CHINA!"
2,Shorewood bike,"It came damaged the fender was beat up and lots of dings and chipped paint. However, I didn't have the energy to send it back and I really wanted to go bike riding with my girls. So, idecided to live with the dings and dents"
5,Good,"I bought this bike despite of some of the negative reviews and so far everything has been well. It arrived in a double box, without any damages, was put together by my husband within an hour. Functions well. I think it is a nice bike for the price."
3,Nice Bike,I really like the Pacific Shorewood Beach Cruiser. I think it is a nice comfortable ride. My only complaint would be that it is really squeeke and the tires tend to go flat every couple times I use it. I really do love it and if those two things didn't happen I would have absolutely no complaints because I am getting a great deal of use out of it. I want to get my friend one and they have no more in stock and that is also a problem. I loved that i could find such an affordable bike and have there be no shipping costs. i have been referring all kinds of people to Amazon. Thanks and let me know when you have more of these bikes in stoke please.
2,Not thrilled,"If you are into aesthetics and have an old fashioned sensibility...it's hard to resist the retro design of this bike.However, I will reiterate that this bike was hard to put together. There were a number of screws missing, and you have go out and buy a sized wrench that most people don't have...(it's funny I bought a $35 dollar bike lock and they provided all the necessary tools in the shipping)The other huge problem was that the brakes were misaligned. And the front tire kept hititng the front brake making it impossible to ride. It took my boyfriend and his friend about two hours to fix this problem. An expert could have done it faster but lets face it if you have a lot of money to pay a bike shop you wouldn't be buying this bike.Also, this bike is longer than a regular bike...which can be a problem if you have any storage space issues."
1,Inside only bike?,"The bike got wet in the rain. Now the entire handlebar is covered in rust, and we've had the bike for less than 6 months... Add to that the difficulty in putting the thing together due to the lack of proper instructions in the manual (which is not specific to this bike), it's hardly worth the $$"
1,Damaged in Shipping,"I never got to try the bike because it was damaged during shipping. The frame was substantially bent, and the return was too difficult. It's very different to return a large item like a bike rather than a book.The shipping box was flimsy and did not protect the merchandise at all, and Amazon was not helpful in returning such a large, cumbersome item.I was very disappointed with the materials and the bike."
3,Adorably retro,"I was looking for an inexpensive bike for exercise and find out if some biking would fit in my life. This one fills the bill. However it does have some flaws. It doesn't feel very sturdily built and even my size 8 shoe touches the front fender on turns. Also my right heel brushes the chain guard. Maybe bikes are like shoes; you should try them on before buying. Also, after shipping and having it assembled at a bike shop, it cost just as much as a fancier Schwinn [...]. Overall though, it does the job and looks great. If I end up biking a lot, I'll shop more carefully for a replacement."
2,Stuck in smoothness....,"Eric's music is part of my life since his days with the GRP label and the Chick Corea Electric Band. What a time, what a brilliant music and what a sax-player!The first song I heard from his latest album was ""One day in Venice"" and I like it. The rest is what we call Smooth jazz - but too smooth - too trivial melodies - just a typical record to be played in the smooth Jazz radio stations.Money talks - musical performance looses.What a disappointment."
4,Old But Still Very Useful...,"Published over 30 years ago in 1964, ""IR Theory and Practice of Infrared Spectroscopy"" has served students and become one of the classics texts in the subject. Unlike many texts in molecular spectroscopy and physical chemistry, this book meets the need for an introductory text devoted entirely to IR and can be utilized even by those who approach the study with no previous background.The section on IR theory focuses on explaining the principles that are most frquently encountered in current literature and research. Presentation of theory is clear, succinct, and thorough. It, however, is not a utterly theoretical presentation that will baffle undergraduates and beginners.You might have to find this item from the library or used bookstore. It is no longer published."
4,A very Nostalgic Doll,"I've had this doll for many years,since I was a yound child. It has endured everything me & my sister put it through,& it's still in fantastic condition. I beleive it's worth the price,as it is a nice doll. The Gashapons are nice too,but this has a very nostalgic power that those may not offer."
3,cool doll,"this is a steep price for this doll, ive bought the lil mini dolls for just $5 & this very doll i got 2 of & they were only $1.48 & thats with tax.. it is a very nice doll however.. these dolls ar every very nice i bought my gf 1"
4,JUST GREAT JAZZ!,"What can I say? Great listening.I'm playing back on a Sony SACD player connected to a 2307 Denon receiver and use moderately priced Boston Accoustic speakers.To my ear, the SACD disk is more than a bit, get it - bit, better than the standard CD disk. Perhaps the recording could be better, but, it is good.Don't you hate it when someone points out a tiny tiny freckle on a beautiful woman. From that point on you miss the beauty in nature's imperfect world. The recording is what it is and will never be redone. So what. It's good stuff."
3,A delightful book in many respects . . .,". . . the only problem being is that some of the contributors could best be described as ""Catholic in Name Only"".This collection of thoughts, essays, lists, etc. describes what the contributors love best about their faith tradition. (Individuals who really do come from many different walks of life -- and have varied and divergent opinions on what the Church would consider key issues).Don't look for doctrine or even spirituality here -- that's not the point of the book. Enjoy the anecdotes, but realize that fidelity to the Magisterium was apparently not required for inclusion!"
1,Zero Stars for Modernism,"The title of this book should be ""I Like Being a NOMINAL Catholic."" The subtitle is inaccurate too - there's very little on ""tradition"" or ""ritual"" here - and when they're mentioned, they're usually trivialized or dismissed. The ""stories"" are mostly about Catholicism at it lowest common denominator - ""feel good"" stories about people who call themselves Catholic but who are really neo-pagans in disguise (some, like Mario Cuomo, are openly pro-choice, for example). There are some exceptions of course (Mother Theresa comes to mind), but mainly what you get here is a modernist perspective on Catholicism that is far from orthodox.Stay away from this book if you are interested in reading about what authentic Roman Catholicism is (not what the disobedient would like it to be). I suggest reading Living the Catholic Faith: Rediscovering the Basics by Archbishop Charles J. Chaput, and A Shepherd Speaks by Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz."
1,Big disappointment,"This performance of Mozart's Requiem is simply the best. Heartbreaking and glorious. The remastering to CD, unhappily, is simply terrible. I have this performance on LP. It's gorgeous and beloved. A successful remastering from the original recording to stereo LP in June 1972. After nearly forty years of frequent playing the surface isn't perfect anymore, but the emotion of the performance still comes through. What joy to find this performance on CD after years of looking! What heartbreak to hear how awful it is! I've tried listening through a closed door in hopes it would soften the harshness of the sound. No luck."
2,Psychobilly??????,"This album is just.........OK....Lets get one thing straight these guys claim to be ""American Psychobilly""....well its not psychobilly this is POP! More billy less psycho. Compared to the European bands this stuff is pretty soft and watered down, and not too evil. Typical Hellcat Records release I'd say. Buy their first release scrap the rest! I just hope this doesn't spawn a bunch of teenagers to think they are ""Psychobilly"" because its not! ..."
2,Dissapointing,"If it wasn't for Nick 13's distinctive voice I'd probably confuse this album with some wannabe Rockabilly band trying to sound like Tiger Army. The fact is, this is a poor attempt by Tiger Army to sound like they did on their first album. The first album was a breath of fresh air, a new style of Rockabilly music that was borderline Punk, borderline Psychobilly. The sounds were cool, crisp, and powerful. This album lacks the heart and soul the first one had. The sounds are pretty dull, and at time I found myself thinking ""Why does this remind me of some 80s pop band trying to sound Rockabilly?"" If i had to guess, and I do, most hardcore Rockabilly fans won't like this nearly as much as fans of Punk rock will, and thats just because the former are used to a more traditional, honest Rockabilly sound. Buyer beware on this one."
5,tiger army...afi? whoa...the resemblance...,i listened to this album...i'm definitely gonna buy it...no doubt about that...i find it strange how tiger army and afi sound nearly EXACTLY the same. the lead singer's vocals are almost quite similar to davey havok's vocal style...just listen...try to find the similiarity...cause there is!!! they sound so much like afi...and i as a HUMUNGUS afi fan...i know afi's music...and davey havok's vocals...whoa. usually i'd get annoyed if there was another band sounding a lot like my favourite band...but this band is so cool they get away with it...which is why i've given them 5 stars!!! tiger army rock!!!god..i fell inlove with vocalist...his vocals are f**king amazing. TIger army might be their latest album...but unlike other bands...their newest album is far from pop or mainstream...it rocks. i hope this band stays around for along time...they rule...
5,TIGER ARMY NEVER DIE,"I love tiger army, and I loved their first album so much too!I cannot even remove The Power of Moonlite out of my cd player and it goes with me everywhere. I love this cd and all the back up vocals from one of my fav people Davey! If you don't have this get it, NoW!!! Nick 13's voice is the coolest voice next to davey havoks. Tiger army and Afi forever!"
3,This Is AFI! Surely? - Seriously Similar to the old stuff,"This is AFI of yester-yearThis is Very Proud Of Ya - Answer that and Stay FashionableIT sounds SO similar it is somewhat scarySO all those AFI fans who prefered the old stuff - This album is perfect for youIts Good - And I feel guilty for only giving this a 3 cos It's cast under the giant shadow of AFIMAybe I should give it a four - I feel tempted toNo - A 3.5 we'll say -But IF you liked the old AFI then this is a must haveAnd I like it and I prefer the new AFI stuffBut A Good Solid CD from Tiger ArmyAnd I really hope they progress and evolve into a full, remarkable band of the new modern era like AFI"
4,Tiger Army knows what they're doing,"I had to go all the way to New York to pick up a copy of this (It's not available in Canada) but this CD was definitely worth the 15 bucks I spent. With amazing songs like In The Orchard and Incorporeal, their music takes on the same style lyrically as AFI and The Misfits, while keeping its own music style. Rock on Tiger Army."
2,have you checked out the fat content???,"We bought this dog food for our beagle who has a sensitive stomach and the tendency to easily pack on the pounds. Eukanuba does not have the ingredients list and nutritional analysis online, but it is on the bags. This particular food's fat content is 17%! To put that in perspective, our equally high end organic puppy food has only 12% fat. Needless to say, our beagle picked up 3 pounds in 1 month on this food. Also, she was still vomiting once a week. We're now giving the Eukanuba to the 10 month old puppy and have switched our adult dog to Natural Balance's limited ingredient formula. The puppy seems to like the Eukanuba, but she had no digestion problems to begin with."
5,Great Food for Dogs with Sensitive Stomachs,"Finally this dog food is again available. The bad part is the increased price. I paid way too much for this food, but my dog needed it. I was paying $50 for 50#'s and this was $75 for 30#. I think the price was a matter of supply and demand."
5,wonderful book with message for everyone,Ordered this after watching Greg Laurie on TV...thought it might be a book our teenagers would like...very down to earth and honest....similar to hearing Greg's talks. Focuses on the basics of why we need God but not in a way that would turn someone off. I will be getting more copies...wish it were on kindle like his other books.
3,Informative and Ebtertaining,"I actually Bought this video as a welcome home gift for my boyfriend. He had said he wanted the film so i knew he would like it, but what suprised me was that i also enjoyed the film. I have no interest in bodybuilding but i try to make an effort for my boyfriend and really enjoyed the film. it was very entertaining and informational."
4,"Bigger, Stronger, Faster",Well presented and researched. I would have liked to see more information on steroids as they relate to heart problems.
4,Great video to show my students,"I will shoe this video to my students to help them understand the affects steriods have on them. We are in a constant battle with this as the students want to get stronger or bigger for sports. They do not see how it will effect them in the future, they only think about right now."
4,Great Doco,"As an avid weight trainer myself it was interesting to see just how far some people will go in the pursuit of the perfect body or sporting achievement.The documentary itself was well researched and presented in a very ""Michael Moorish"" fashion but all the better for it. It's a slice of America very few would like you to see.From Arnold and Stallone to Carl Lewis and Tiger Woods you see just how far these athletes and stars will bend the rules and manipulate the public to achieve their ends.A great watch."
4,Gives You the Other Side,"What I really like about this documentary is that it gives you an objective look at steroids that considers both sides of the debate. Another thing I liked was how the producer connected steroids with America's culture of ""Winning."" The many hypocrisies of politicians and stars was also revealing."
5,Emotional and Entertaining...,"The director and his family are like most American families with very loving and religious parents, who in all honestly deal with their own emotions, feelings and beliefs in a very realistic approach. Extremely educational with facts and reality. This is a documentary which analysis steroids in many facets medically, nutritionally and more important politically. It makes you see the way that big business, news stations and other entities operate and manipulate the facts for financial gain with the help of the same representatives that you voted for and placed in public office. Can not say enough good things about this documentary. Superb, well done, honest, humane, educational and emotional. Bravo."
4,"Interesting, no doubt","As critical as the title is, I actually enjoyed this documentary. I'm always interested in behind the scenes bodybuilding, and this film inspired me to look into more natural and less dangerous ways to achieve the same goals as steroids.If nothing else, this film will make you think about the role that steroids has in our world, whether your are for or against it.The production quality is good and never distracting, the narrative is pleasant, and I would watch this again without hesitation.I would suggest checking it out."
5,Definitely worth watching at least once,"Thoroughly enjoyed this onePurchased it after watching it on cable and have watched it numerous times since I purchased itInformative and entertaing, yes people can oppose the thoughts and views in it, as long as they don't go as far as the debaucle the is ""Fat Head""The one thing I would have liked to see more of in this was the Chris Benoit storyIt just seemed to be thrown in there for like one minute, I would have really liked to see them go into some depth of that particular story and any other ""grim results"" due to steroids"
2,Meh -- no miracles here,"Two stars for working like a normal shampoo -- cleans hair just like a $4.00 grocery store brand. I'm almost to the end of my first bottle, and I unfortunately have no miracles to report. My hair continues to thin slowly and surely, just like it has since my mid-twenties. Of course, I didn't really expect this to work, but thought I'd try it out anyway. While I don't think I'll be ponying up for a second bottle, I do think I'll be watching more movies with Bruce Willis and Jason Statham. Go bald guys!"
2,Interesting but unoriginal and rudimentary,"Bertolini uses the driest of styles to discuss a rather basic theory of American individualism through some fictional works. In the end, his ideas, which are based on the work of other scholars, fail to yield any real insight."
1,HORRIBLE SHIPPING!,"I would like to tell you my opinion of the bike, but I never even got to see it. The company that amazon uses to ship the bike (Eagle freight) lost my bike (even with a tracking number!) They refused to admit this after several rounds of calling and waiting on hold. Even the supervisor never returned my phone call. I explained the situation to amazon and they were very helpul and offered to send out a replacement immediately, but unfortunately they would only send it by Eagle, so I took the refund. If you want to pay a small amount for a bike, buy it here. If you want to actually own a bike and ride it, buy it somewhere else."
3,You Get What You PAY For,Basically a first bike at almost no cost for someone returning to using a bike after years without riding. Arrived in box in less than a week. Put it together easily in less than 30mins. A little shakey and rattles when you ride but for the cost a pretty good deal. If keep riding on any regular basis will definately want to upgrade to a better made bike though.
2,Missing Parts and Customer Service,"If you decide to purchase this bicycle, may I offer some advice. If your bicycle arrives missing a part, please immediately return it to the store where it was purchased. My wife's bicycle arrived minus the front fender with bolt. The folks at the Customer Service Department at Pacific Cycle were understanding and said that I would receive the missing parts with 10 business days. After two weeks passed, I called again, this time the parts were on backorder. Curious, I asked why I wasn't told that two weeks earlier. ""You have to dig down in our system"", was the answer.I asked when I might receive the missing parts. ""Could be two or three more months"", she replied. When I suggested that two months was a long time, she said something I didn't expect, ""You know, there's no reason that you can't ride the bicycle without the fender""."
3,One speed,"The other reviewer apparently failed to understand that this is a ""one-speed"" bike. I can't judge quality of construction, since I haven't received the bike yet, but it seems to be as advertised: ""single speed""."
2,NOT Funny - and only for Teens,"Although the basic tenants of comedy are presented here, the sketches that are used as illustrations are: (a) not funny and (b) useful for teens or younger only. This book seems geared to for middle school teaching usage when there's not much other material around. I put together sketches each year for a community variety show and was looking for some new inspiration. Hopefully, I thought, this book could give some ""Second City"" types of baselines. This book definitely did NOT come even close. Additionally, the AMAZON write-up did not properly identify that the book is geared to young themes and interests, ignoring older funny-bones."
2,Underpowered,The unit just doesn't have the needed features to make it. It does not have an auto-stop for the auto-reverse deck. It does not have the power to drive the longer tapes. I find that many tapes end up with significant wobble as the tape reaches the end.
1,TEAC W-518,"THIS CASSETTE PLAYER IS FLIMSY PLASTIC, THE CONTROLS FEEL LIKE THEY WILL BREAK AT LIGHT PRESSURE. ONLY ONE OF THE DUAL CASSETTES SELF-REVERSES. A CHEAP UNIT. TERRY WILLSON"
5,Chi-Chi,"Easy and delicious! Have made it in a 9x5"" loaf pan as well as in a mini-muffin pan; both methods yield a great-tasting product."
5,This is some GOOOOOD stuff!,"I made the recipe on the package and my family LOVED this dish. I will make it many, many times. My grandson said he wanted a whole dishful just for himself!"
4,First Ingredient is sugar...dessert for sure!,"I had never made this or had it at a mexican food diner, so I did not know what to expect. It is good and very moist, but if you use creamed corn with added sugar in it your muffins or corn loaf will be very sweet. I will make my own cream corn to add next time instead of using Libby's canned cream corn which is high in salt and sugar. I like sweets but this was a little over the top using canned cream corn. The first ingredient in the dry mix is sugar, not Corn Masa as listed on the Amazon site so be advised this is definitely a dessert."
5,amazingly delicious!,sooo happy amazon sells this! the one grocery store that has it in my neighborhood is closing!!!! this is delicious!!! perfect for a fiesta night!
4,Makes bringing a side dish a little easier,"I've got no talent in the kitchen but in today's economy hosts really appreciate guests who contribute to the atmosphere by bringing a side dish. I'd sampled this corn cake at a friends and couldn't believe it came from a mix. I immediately ordered the mix from Amazon and put it to the test. So easy (water, melted butter and a cake pan) even I couldn't mess it up!! I took it to the next gathering where it was a hit. I only wish it came in a smaller shipment (min. shipment is a pack of 12) but since everyone always seems to want the recipe, we can share."
5,A must have for our annual houseboat trip,"Our daughter was very unhappy because she could not find Chi-Chi's Sweet Corn Cake Mix in her grocery stores. Thanks to Amazon.com the ""fix"" was easy. We had Corn Cake while dining on Lake Powell. Heard the grand kids were enjoying more Chi-Chi's Corn Cake last night. Thank you! SR"
3,Quality over quantity,"This anthology is like no other. Rather than including every single comic in a given time period, it only picks out selected ones. The 3 stars corresponds to the 3 out of every 5 comics it decided to publish. Too bad it didn't include every one."
3,No pickles,Imagine my disappointment when this book arrived and I discovered that it had nothing to do with pickles. Three bushels of cucumbers went to waste.
4,Timeless,"Although this book is somewhat dated, the cartoons created byBrian Crane are timeless and apply today."
3,Could have been better,"I really enjoy reading Pickles every day. That makes it a bit discouraging to buy this book and be disappointed. I hoped that by buying the collections, I would be able to catch up on strips that I had missed since I travel for work. Unfortunately, the publishers have chosen only a small fraction of the available strips - and the strips seem to be out of context/continuity. Some of the funniest strips have been those that take several days or a week to unfold and they aren't here. No Sunday strips at all!"
5,Present for Dear old Mom,She laughed and laughed! This is one of her favorite comic strips and it was read before the morning was over.
4,A very good album,"Although it can't match his ""Bat"" albums, I still thoroughly enjoy this cd. Even the Dianne Warren penned songs. Of course nothing can stay the same or it would get boring after a while, which is the reason artists like to change styles and songwriters etc every so often. And this is one of those albums. But Meatloaf is still Meatloaf, (although I have recently heard that he no longer goes by that name). I really can't find much if anything, to dislike about this album. Most fans of 'The artist previously known as Meatloaf' will love this. The 18 page booklet has all the lyrics written in a 40's style gangster/crime novel style, complete with pictures of 40's paperback crime novel covers."
5,Welcome to the Neighborhood,This is great album.Of course not better than Bat I and II. But it belongs to the group of his best records. Even it was able to enter top 20 in the USA( I think 17th place and was platinum for almost million sold coppies)and it is not so usual.And for the rest of the world it was big success( in the UK reached 2nd place).The song I'd lie for you is amazing and Original sin too. Meat is really able to make a great album without Jim Steinman( wrote only two songs).I really recomend this album.
3,A dissapointing follow up to Bat Out of Hell 2,"After Bat Out of Hell 2: Back into hell was released I saw Meat Loaf in concert. It was the climax of my love affair with Meat and Jim Steinman's music. I was extremely satisfied. What more could this man do? Well, basically what goes up must come down. This album is a small slip in Meat's career. The biggest mistake is that Jim Steinman's influence is not on this album very much. Now, I love many songs by Diane Warren. I though that he collaboration with Meat Loaf was going to be great. Well, I was wrong. It's like he's trying to hard to make an album like the Bat albums without Jim writing the whole thing. There are some good songs on them but they just aren't as complex and passionate as the Bat out of Hell albums. I'm lucky that my husband was a radio DJ at the time this album came out because he gave it to me for free as a promotion from Meat's record company. I would have felt jipped if I had bought it."
2,Say it with me -- Diane Warren is the Antichrist.,"As we all learned with Midnight at the Lost and Found, Loaf - Steinman = middling-to-bad album. Now add a +Diane Warren, and you've got a date with disaster. Warren is not so much a songwriter as a cliche-database -- type in your subject and she spews a lukewarm, familiar-sounding song about it. Steinman takes chances with his wordplay and imagery, Warren never would. So her three tracks sound like an imitation of a parody of Steinman's work.Steinman's two tracks are good but not his best. Rounding out the album are what sounds like a Van Halen B-side, an over-histrionic cover of Tom Waits' sedate ""Martha,"" and a couple more Steinman knock-offs interspersed with less-than-a-minute filler.All of which leads me to one conclusion: If it features Meat Loaf and the title does not include the words ""Bat"" or ""Rocky Horror,"" leave it on the rack."
3,Good but not great,"3.5 stars. The sentimental joy of Bat Out of Hell I and II are not quite here in this release. Diane Warren has a strong piece MeatLoaf with ""I'd Lie for You"" and Jim returns for a couple good tracks here as well. I was hoping for a monumental follow-up to Bat II here (hard to do) but had to settle for a little less. There are some great tracks with superb performances on this record including the aforementioned however just not much else besdies them.For Meat Loaf records, this is one of his best. I rank Meat Loaf records.Bat Out of Hell IIBat IWelcome to the NeighborhoodBad AttitudeDead RingerBlind While I SleepMidnight at the Lost and FoundHave not listened to Couuldve Said It Better"
4,Great timing,When I ordered this product I was worried how long it would take to get to me. Before I knew it it had been delivered & I was watching it.
1,Good idea poorly implemented,"LED bulbs simply don't fit in a standard mini-mag. No amount of finessing worked. Sketchy, incomplete instructions were written microscopically on a tiny sheet of folded paper. This product is useless and a complete waste of money."
3,so far so good,I ordered the the light coversionI have used from time to time and it seems to work fine. It is a little brighter that the stock mini mag light bulb(but not by much)I don't know how it will effect battery life yet.
3,Bright but the beam is lacking,"I bought a couple of these trying to save money rather than buying the Maglite 3 watt LED flashlights.What I found is that the light produced is bright white, and if you use it in close quarters it's OK. But the standard 2 AA flashlight in the beam mode will light up a path much better than this 3 LED upgrade.So in my opinion I wouldn't waste my money on this particular upgrade, and either go for one of the AA Maglite 3 watt flashlights (which range in price from $16.99-$24.99 depending on color). I think the only other consideration might be the 1 watt single LED upgrades made by this company and a few others. But rather than spend $10 - $20.00 and more on a LED upgrade kit you might as well send the money on a new AA Maglite flashlight. At least you know you're getting quality from them."
2,"Where Are The 12"" Versions","The Almighty group states that this hard to find 12"" versions, but they may have cut down from the 12"" version, but 80% of these songs have been edited down to about 4 minutes or less. This was a big disappointment."
5,All about value,"The wipes do not take off all the cloudy smudges on the glasses when cleaning them as they are. If you wet the glasses with a bit of water and then dry them with the tissue they work much better.Personally, I use these things as a great every day wipe that gets off all of the dust and general use smudges. However, I always keep the most towelette wipes of other brands ready for those smudges that these wipes just won't get or when I want that ultra-clear view.This is a great product if you are trying to save a little money over the moist wipes, and they get the same job done with an extra minute of effort for a fraction of the price. It's all about value."
1,OPPSSSS..............,After I order the product they send me an email about after five days and told me that they dont have the product in their stock. R u kidding ... u should have check ur stocks before u advertise on the internet and charging my card. They return my money but I needed that phone to gave some one but I wasnt able to get the phone. That was messed up and I will never buy any product from this seller in my damm life. I promise it?
4,Gift to daughter Nokia 6126,"Daughter is very happy with the Nokia 6126. Now, little sis is demanding one. Very nice phone."
1,Great Phone But.....,I bought a Nokia 6126 in December of 2006. It was a great phone but it has one major flaw. The internal LCD is very fragile. It does not have any kind of hard surface on it. It's like touching a LCD computer monitor. I had the phone in my pocket with some loose change. A coin worked its way between the interior screen and the keypad. In the course of about an hour it ruined the screen and the phone will not work. I sent it to be repaired and they wouldn't cover it under the warranty and wanted $160.00 to repair it. I told them to forget it. I ate the cost of the phone and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i.
4,Good phone,"I found this phone quite nice. The speaker phone is quite loud, and the screen is large and bright. The button to flip the phone open with one hand is very usefull, although I dont know yet how durable it is. I bought this phone especially because it is a quad band, for good international coverage while travelling, for the speaker phone and because it looked like a good Nokia clam shell. I am happy with all these functions. The battery drains quickly if you use the speakerphone (as with most models) so it would be good to keep a spare."
3,Did not have all songs,"""Sad Sweetheart of the Rodeo (live)"" and ""Cream and Bastards Reprise"" are listed on the track listings in the product description; however after much exploration I have not been able to find either of these tracks on the record. They are also not listed on the album's case. The product description does not match the product itself and this was disappointing. However, the item shipped quickly and with good quality."
4,Nice set,Kind of a quirky collection. I can see why it did not sell too well and can be picked up cheap. Not a lot of 'hits' but interesting to listen too once in awhile.
2,There Are Much Better Books Out There,"An unabashed aviation and 747 buff, I try read every aviation book I can find. While this title does have some interesting photos, the number of inaccuracies and gross errors made me cringe. For example, the number of windows on the upper deck (three vs. ten) is not the way to tell a series -100 from a -200 aircraft; while this is a common misconception, an aviation writer should know better. As for the photo captions, these range from banal, with phrases such as ""shows to good advantage"" used many times, to entirely fictitious: a photo showing a KLM 747 surrounded by KLM servicing vehicles and modern jetways is not ""somewhere in the Middle East"" but Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, as anyone with at least some familiarity with this major gateway would know. My recommendation: type ""Boeing 747"" in Amazon's search engine; all the in-print titles there are highly worthwhile."
4,creepy edge-of-your-seat suspense that will please most fans,"this movie is actually a trilogy of three short stories, with creepy, yet sometimes predicatble twists at the end. The first story contained the best surprise, and the last story was the worst. the second story was the most atmospheric and also had a twisty ending. If you avoid the last segment and stick with the first two, this is a movie that will be enjoyed."
5,Explosive and Threatening!!!,"With the discovery of the MJ12 Documents in the national archives, Friedman made history. How accurate are the papers? And how reliable is the list of these 12 top scientists and military men?? That is the question.Nevertheless, there are plenty of evidence and dat to substantiate Friedman's claims. Great book!!!"
5,I support Stan F!,"His research is awesome,and I think this shadow group is real.I have a book at home (Ufo's Exist!) where Donald Menzel claimed he is one of a few people to have seen a flying saucer!!This book by Stan F is an eye opener for MJ12 lovers and I think Stan F is on the right track!"
1,gen x ad copy,"This is not a gardening book, its a Gen X ad copy, coffee table book. Save your money, buy a real garden book, I garden and found it just useless."
2,NOT MUCH USE IN THE REAL WORLD,I'm a professional resume writer who works globally. I found this book to be filled with outdated and simplistic templates rather than intelligent ideas.
5,Extremely Valuable Resource,"This book is well written, and so comprehensive that anyone considering a business career overseas should seriously consider it. The fact that all of the chapters are written by professional recruiters from their own country is a double plus - they know what they're talking about, and they give good, clear advice on the cultural differences that are really so important, in both the application and in the interview. I find it particularly helpful in the area of job information sources within the specific country; it lists newspapers, directories, employment agencies, and regional newspapers, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc., etc.! I have already recommended it to a number of friends."
3,"Good for job hunting tips, low on sample CV's","If you just want a guide that explains some of the unique cultural aspects of job hunting in a lot of different countries, this would be the right guide for you. It covers almost every region in the world and explains the visa process, interview practices and job hunting tips. On this aspect it is an excellent book for the international job hunter. However, if you are looking for a lot of sample CV's, this won't be very helpful. The sample CV's included are limited to a few countries and are mostly geared for a new graduate or young professional (most CV's here are 1 page long, whereas overseas CV's are generally supposed to be at least 2 pages if you have any level of experience). There should have been at least one example for each country, but if you read the country details, you can figure out how to adjust the CV to fit that country."
1,Nice Try,"While the AI has improved significantly, and the 3-d effects are nice, overall this isn't much of an improvement over the original. Instead of upgrading your core units, your sub-commanders gain experience which is far less satisfying. The heavy reliance on reinforcements throughout missions left me cold. Playing as the Americans is unbearable due to the pathetic voice acting. And the StarForce ultra-intrusive copy protection was the final blow, I want that thing off my computer but it can't be uninstalled."
3,Great Game,"I had a lot of fun with Blitzkrieg 2. It was very replayble, and decently historicly acurate. I would recomend this game to any RTS fan who loves tanks or wwii."
1,Blitzkrud,"DO NOT BUY.DO NOT INSTALL.Will not run properly! No patches or updates or customer support, my machine more than meets minimum running requirements too."
4,A fine Work,"This work done by Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark and Chris Hillman is different than the work they have done before. It does have the disco flavor of the seventies but I find that not to be a negative thing (even though I was never a disco fan). The first side of the LP appeals to me the most with the sadness that laces the songs that continues to ring long after it has stopped playing.This album appears to be highly refined in the studio, which to some seems to be a bad thing, I don't hold that view.(The CD with the extra tracts, which are demo versions, gives a peek at what can be done with the raw song in the studio.) The harmonies are splendid, the variation of instruments is nice and I hope that the ones who truly love music will sit down and really listen to the beautiful work these three men (and the other musicians and professionals) have created."
4,Anyone But You,"I enjoyed reading Zeises's new novel. Seattle was a great female narrator and was more than a character on paper. She was real, easily relatable since she obviously wasn't perfect.Critter was even more fun. He acted exactly like I'd think a boy his age would. The fun part was seeing into his mind. His little quirks and reading along with his embarrassing moments.And I laughed out loud more than once and really felt for the characters till the end. I definitely recommend!"
3,Need more monkeys.,Needs more monkeys for the kids to play with.the barrel comes only 1/3 full. Buy more than one barrel.
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","If you are looking for poems that contain more than three words from a word family then this is not the book for you. Most of the poems only contain two or three words from the word family being focused on. The author gives many additional activities for working with word families, but I purchased this hoping for poems with many words from a word family to focus on with my first graders. Although, overall it is a well organized book."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book looking for inspiration for a Celtic or Viking tattoo design. Hearing what a revered artist Courtney Davis was, I thought I couldn't go wrong with this book. Unfortunately, all the drawings were incredibly unsophisticated and they remind me more of an amateur's work (perhaps at copying Courtney Davis). All of the designs were in black and white and many of them were just plain - and I *do* mean plain - knotwork patterns better suited to tablecloths than tattoos. There is none of the beautiful intricacy you find in real Celtic art - almost all of the patterns have huge unfilled or ""blackened"" spaces.If you're looking for inspiration in Celtic design, buy a reproduction of the Book of Kells. I know that will put the shoddiness of this work to light. I suspect this was just a cheap attempt at making money and that Courtney himself does not prize this work.The good news is - it's cheap, so it wasn't a total waste."
4,a good resource for charted scrollwork,"This is a great resourse for those looking for charted scrollwork, knotwork and other Celtic or Norse motifs."
2,Norse and Celtic Designs,"Not exactly what I was looking for, thus was not what I was expecting. Will need to go to book store when I need more information on Norse and Celtic designs."
3,Good for long distance sports,"I found this Item to be good for Horse races , Baseball games , and things that are a good distance from you but the action will all happen in frame. There is a delay in pushing the button and taking the picture that you have to get used to. timing it , but you can really get some good shots once you get a custome to it. To hope for the best timing on short actions , like a pitch the multi frame function works best. If you are within 100 ft. of were the action is use a digital camera."
4,Can You See Me Now!,Hard to figure out what to with it at first.After I learned how to use all of buttons and focus on it I've had fun with it. Take your time and practice with it.
1,Yuck,"I got this item instead of a regular digital camera since I loove photographing nature and wildlife. However, I have had nothing but problems with it and I am sending it back. Beware"
2,Not as good as I hoped,I bought this on a lightning deal. I figured the price was so great that I was not all that worried about the quality.The optic are clear and provide good visuals. They just don't extend as far as I would like them to. I was hoping for this to be something to use while birding but I'll stick with the binoculars that have been in the family forever. This will become something I let my granddaughter (now 6) use when we are out adventuring.
5,Elegant,"This album is magnificent. The music is beautiful. If you have enjoyed other work Hisaishi has done for Miyazaki films, more than likely this will be no different. It's peaceful and melodic; then suddenly, it attacks with dazzling turbulence. I very rarely write reviews but the only other one did not do justice to this work and may have turned you away from something so marvelous."
4,A playful exploration in music form,"For as talented and popular as Takako Minekawa is in Japan, its a wonder that she hasn't maintained as strong a following in the US. Minekawa differentiates from other breathy Japanese vocalists in that she is also a talented composer, producer, and arranger. The playful numbers she has been so closely identified with are present on her EP Maxi On!, and flow effortlessly into deeper arrangements that suggest an urgency and emotional complexity that makes the EP so engaging. Minekawa's understated vocals guide the listener equally well through both the playful and somber, the distraught and ecstatic, and altogether seamless collection of songs. Song titles including ""Lullaby Of Grey,"" ""A Report On An Investigation,"" and ""Sleeping Bag"" allude to this playful and varied emotional romp, making for a listen just as rewarding the nth time thru."
3,Slow Ballad,"The ""tough guys"" release a ballad. It doesn't really sound like them. I love Point Break, but I like their ""bad boy"" tough attitude and type of music. The ballad doesn't work for them. If you like them for being ""tough"", then I wouldn't reccomend this single, but if you're up to seeing what it's like for them to actually sing instead of their rap, then give it a whirl."
4,Love Heroes Season 1!,"I'm very picky with the television shows that I watch. The quality and creativity of movies and television shows coming out the past few years, just aren't as good as they used to be 5-10 years ago. Heroes when it came out was unique and different. Most of the time characters are flat and what you see is what you get. The writers of Heroes really did a great job in creating characters are fully fleshed out and have great character development."
3,"Great show, NOT truly Blu-Ray quality","The show is great...watched it on DVD once already. But I'm very disappointed in the supposed Blu-ray quality of the discs. Scenes are granulated and few scenes are truly Blu-ray'd out. They were so much more expensive, but you can just about get the same quality on DVD...certainly not enough of an upgrade to justify the price increase."
4,Show is awesome,I have watched this multiple times. I love this show and season one is definitely the best. Wish the show kept going.
1,A Real Disappointment,"Celestron may have a good reputation for telescopes, but these binoculars are pretty awful.They're mostly cheap plastic... more the kind of construction I'd expect for children's toy binoculars. The cover for the SD card slot and USB connection didn't fit properly, and kept popping out of place.I've been using binoculars for over 40 years, and have never before handled a pair that performed this poorly. Adjusting for the distance between my pupils was easy enough, and the diopter adjustment worked well. But nothing improved the problem of double images when focusing beyond about 25'.I can't really say how the camera works... I never got to try it! I certainly expected much better quality from Celestron."
1,Celestron 3.1 MP Binoc,"These Binoculars are pure trash. The quality of the binocular build is horrible, and the pictures that it captures are even worse. I couldn't get a clear picture with it mounted on a tripod. DO NOT spend your money on these unless you feel like wasting it!"
4,You can even put a sail on it,"I prefer the Intex Mariner and the Intex Seahawk II, because they are firmer, but this is not a bad boat. It has more weight carrying capacity and can take a bigger motor than either of the Intex boats I mentioned.I use my Sevylor Super Caravelle with a SailboatsToGo sail kit. I love that I can have a sailboat that fits inside my car and can travel in checked baggage on the airlines. I posted some pictures (click on thumbnails under the main product picture)."
3,Oster Blender Blade Assembly,The Oster Blender Blade Assembly I received started to to show some corrosion /oxidization -right ater the first day- at he top of the axle where it was probably hammered together instead of pressing it together. That part of the blade assembly is where the food is being blended and obviously this oxidization shows that the part used is of inferior quality and may further interact with food that enhances oxidization and interact with taste. The old part which started to leak after 4 years of use had no corrosion at all. They must have used the right steel material not just some steel covered low grade iron. I hope the manufacturer gets this message and they will upgrade to a better metal.
4,Mine came with a gasket/sealing ring,"FWIW, I ordered this and it did come with the gasket/sealing ring."
1,Where the X#@%&^* is the gasket?,"Look, the product plainly reads ""Oster Blender Blade with Gasket"" and the package that was delivered is titled ""Processing Unit with Sealing Ring"". The blade was in the package but there was no sealing ring/gasket to be found. I'm sure there is the possibility that I got the one defective package off the line but what kind of quality assurance is that?! I'm not telling anyone to buy or not buy this product but just be aware that you may have a problem. I now need to buy a whole separate gasket which maybe costs all of $1.50 and will pay shipping of probably $3."
3,Includes 1 Black Medium Ball-Point Refill (8513) in pen,"the spare part I do not arrive in the box, the ballpoint pen is excellent but they deceived to me with the one of the spare part"
2,Misled.,"I have a twelve year old copy of the English version of ""Pray The Rosary"". It is an excellent booklet on how to pray the rosary. However, it is falling apart. I was looking for a replacement. I came across this title, and thought I was going to get an English/Spanish version. The title gives the impression that you are receiving one book which has both English and Spanish versions of the rosary. This is not the case. You end up with ten boolets. All are in Spanish. If that is what you want, I'm sure the booklets would rate five stars. The old English version booklet that I have, most definitely rates five stars. However, if you are expecting one book, with both English and Spanish, you will be sadly disappointed."
4,We're Free Now!!!,"As I am writing this review, ""Music For People"" has less than a month until the release date (9/12/00). Until then, We can all stay somewhat sane with ""Free"". Amazing song, definatley has more of a groove than almost anything the first album. Iffy lyrics, but hey, It's VAST!!!"
2,Tried the product for 2 months,I tried the product for 2 months.. didn't notice a change at all... however I was pleased that the cream had a plain scent (not flowery or smelly at all)... I had no troubles taking the pill or using the cream... but I never felt any tingle... and the size was not changed at all.. so it did not work for me but I gave it a try...
3,Still On First Bottle,"I just purchased the one month supply of the Breast Actives Kit just to see how it goes. So far I'm half way through the month so I have about 30 pills left. I don't really notice a big difference. It still looks the same to me, it just looks more lifted and firm. I'm still a 34A though. So I can't really say if it works or not because like I said it's only been half a month and they said for permanent results it has to take like 3 to 6 months or more if you want them even bigger. It's weird though because sometimes they feel heavy and then the next day I feel nothing. But I'll tell you more by the end of this month."
1,Unfortunately Breast Actives does NOT work.,"For all of you ladies considering Breast Actives...please don't waste your money, I certainly did. I have never bought a product like this before and decided after reading all of the convincing website info and reviews that I would at least give it a try. Not only do the pills and cream not work in the slightest but they both have a very potent stench, not a good one. I for one, would rather have small breasts that do not stink like a strong herbal cream. Unfortunately since I tried the whole quantity and waited each day to see if they would somehow miraculously grow, I am pretty sure I will not get my money back. Just wanted to give all you lovely small chested women some honest advice. I guess there are several women with overly huge breasts struggling to hide stretch marks and find ways to shrink theirs...we should just be happy with what we have. Lessen learned :)"
2,"SO FAR, NO RESULTS","SO I BOUGHT THESE BREAST ACTIVES AND BEEN ONLY 2 WEEKS AND NO RESULTS.I WILL GIVE IT MORE TIME, ACTUALLY I WILL FINISH THE 2 JARS OF SUPPLEMENTS,AND WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW TO KEEP YOU PEOPLE POSTED. I TAKE THEM EVERY DAYAT DIFFERENT TIMES AND MAYBE THAT COULD BE THE PROBLEM.I READ WHERE YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM COFFEE, AND I TAKE THE SUPPLEMENTS 2 HOURS OR MORE LATER. I ALSO APPLY THE CREAM EVERY MORNING, AFTER MY SHOWER.THE ONLY TIME MY BREAST ARE FIRMER, IS TIME OF THE MONTH.I JUST HOPE I DID NOT WASTE MY MONEY, CAUSE THAT WOULD SUCK."
1,no effected,i didnt got any effected from this item untile i finisht it i make all the details on the bell with massage but there is no effect.
2,Has too many side affects,"i bought this hoping to gain any size (barely an A) I took this as directed regularly for a month. First week nothing happened. Second week I started to notice my breast felt fuller. I was super excited. Week three though I started having digestive issues, but that was expected from the fennel (it keeps you regular) but then it turned into IBS symptoms. Week 4 I developed really bad acne.Since the herbs in the pills mimic hormones during puberty it makes sense. But then it turned into cystic acne and I quit taking the pills. I've never had cystic acne in my life! It's been 2 weeks since stopping BA. Any gain from the first month of use is gone."
1,Not for me,"I had high hopes after reading other reviews, but it did nothing for me. Oh, well, I'll try a diferent one."
1,Did not work for me,"I tried using this product for 3 months and it did not work at all for me. Not only did it not work, it also caused me to have a lot of yeast infections during the period that I used this product for. After I stopped using it, the yeast infections stopped occurring. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem but it was a horrible experience for me and a complete waste of money. I hope this review is helpful. From reading reviews that others have posted it looks like it has worked for some people but obviously, it's not for everyone."
1,Not worth the money,I have been taking this stuff for a week now. I have been gaining weight like crazy. Normally I don't have alota cravings. I'm not prego and with this stuff i've been craving alota sweets. This product is not worth it. Spend your money on mamonite. That stuff works great!! I wanted to save alittle money. But ima go back to mamonite!!!
2,Product Does Not Do What It Claims,"May work for some, but I haven't had any results or benefit from this product. I have been using for three months."
1,Not happening!,"I was looking through my previous orders and came across this mess! I should have reviewed this already! This is a complete waste of time and MONEY! I dont understand why these people have positive misleading reviews about this stupid product! It is a scam! It does NOTHING!!! NOTHING AT ALL! You people who have GREAT things to say about this product are not being honest because if you did have any kind of growth, then it is not or will not be permanent! Just stop already and take this off of amazon! I dont understand people these days! Dont matter if you buy here or off the actual website, it is a phony product and EVERYONE needs to know that! Don't waste your money on this. Honestly, I took this for a LONG TIME and it did nothing for me. I am a healthy eater and everything you can imagine and this product still did nothing for me! Even a few friends tried this and hated it! Dont be crazy people, do not waste your money on this CRAP!"
3,Still a working process,"I am giving it a 3 star, because it has only been a month. I ordered a second month already and plan on checking back then. As of now I do not see a change in size but I am hopeful."
1,Didnt work,"I used this for about 3 months, and it didnt do anything. If fact, im pretty sure it just caused me to gain like 5 pounds. Biggest waste of money ever! I spent over 200 on 6 month supply."
3,Breast Actives,I have notice so far a slight fullness on my breast but is barely Ive been using it for a month now so have to give it more time if it works
4,Good product,Good price for both. Definitely would recommend this product to others. It is probably one of the best products that I have tried.
4,Just got it.,"I got it and opened it up. The jar is smaller than it looks in the picture, and I'm hoping lasts a month. After opening the bottle, I smelled the pills immediately. The smell isn't too horrible IMO, but it definitely is not remotely pleasant.I knocked off a star due to the shrinkwrap around the jar (you'll need a knife to cut it) and the smell of the pills.I will write another review after using this for a while."
4,Good Product,"This product save your money by not performing plastic surgery. Until now, I am about to complete the third month. Positive result is slightly there, however, I will wait until the completion of 6 months as advised to give final comment about this product."
4,breast actives!,"I bout a couple months suply of the lotion and pills..used it every day and night like it says.I didn't see any grouth,but I'm still veary pleased with it.I resently had a baby,and breast feeding can do a number on them!using breast actives I could see a dramastic lift and fuller and firmer!it made my breasts look healthy agin!and I love the smell of the pills!!!smells like fresh suger cane to me!I havnt had any money to get more but every one says they say a change at 3 months."
2,Effects did not last,"As much as I wish this wasn't true, any size increase I experienced (which, after 6 months, was minimal), disappeared within two months after stopping the program. I took the pills every day and applied the cream diligently, and now 9 months later I have nothing to show for it. I sincerely hope this works for you, but it did not work for me."
1,DOES IT REALY WORK??,"OK I NEED SOME HELP HERE I SEE A LOT OF PPL SAYING ITS A FAKE,NOT REAL .SOME ONE PLES TELL ME THE TRUTH .U CAN E MAIL ME SMETLOW@YAHOO.COM"
2,How do you take the pills?,I have tried it before but not truly gone through it all the way... I'm very confused how to take the pills...one in the morning one at night or two at the same time????pls help!!! I really want to try them and want to take it correctly
4,it worked for me,I used these pills for 5 months and my breast increased two sizes i was a 32b now im a 34c!! it takes time to notice anything and they do get bigger before your period. i am going to continue to take them even after 6 months. im switching to bust boom for a while to try it out because its cheaper and has more ingreidents.
3,Very gradual but works,"I'm on my 3rd bottle and I could see a very suttle difference at 2 months. I could see and feel that I was a wee bit fuller. I had no side effects, no headaches or sore breasts. I can't really tell if it is still working but I'm going to keep taking it. I bought it when it was for sale for $35 each so I thought it was well worth the risk. I say wait until it goes back on sale. I feel more confident and a little fuller so I'm going to keep taking it."
2,SO FAR.....,I've been using this product for almost two weeks. I do feel tenderness but then again i started taking it a week before my period was supposed to come on and so i can't tell if its the product or my cycle. also i'm breaking out on my face and i have pretty good skin so im pissed. I also model and its not helping my career lol. I don't know whether to continue or not because these breakouts are discouraging. I only have the month amount because I did not want to waste a lot of money on something i wasn't sure of myself. If it shows better results in the third and fourth week i will def purchase more along with some proactiv smh. Like i said its only been almost two weeks....we will see i will keep you updated.
3,No sign yet...,"I just bought this product - I'm not quite finished the 1st bottle of pills and cream. I have not noticed any changes in my breasts, as others have noticed within the first month. I will continue to use this product for a few more months and will post updated reviews.As I imagine, the effects vary from person to person so I just have to be patient.I read the reviews before purchasing this product and they were outstanding. So I am hopeful it will work for me. If not, looks like I'll be getting my money back!!"
1,No growth and weight gain,"Since I have been on this product, I have gained about 15 lbs over the course of 3 months. As a result, my breasts have grown slightly but only due to weight gain. I did NOT change my diet or anything like that as I work as a model and promo girl so my looks are always a high priority to me and I make a conscious effort to look slim and such every day.The pills smell awful... do not take a deep breath.The cream has a slight scent to it and it leaves a residue that looks funny on your skin afterwards. As I would sweat throughout the day, it would leave little dark flakes. Not so good.The product itself does not make your breasts grow sadly..."
5,Very Useful Book,We bought this book after purchasing our first goat. We are very pleased with our purchase. Always referring to the book and finding the answers that we need. We recommend to any and all goats owners. Well worth the money!
5,No matter how long you have goats there is so much tidbits that Invaluable,"I learned more in this book & was truly surprised at even though it is written to be a guide for children, it is a universal book for all!! Very informative, great tips & with us doing a new Christian Education center for children on goats & other animals, it gives a new perspective for everyone on our Pure of Heart Farms here in Florida. Even if you are not a goat owner, there are great aspects for any responsible pet owner!! A MUST HAVE!!!!!"
4,For Kids - But Great for Adults,This book is written for kids - but the author has written it in a way that works for adults also. Good solid information that is communicated for all ages. Excellent for the person thinking about raising goats or the novice just beginning with goats.
5,The book I recommend with every goat I sell!,"It's not just a guide for kids, but one of the best guides period! This is the book I recommend to first time goat buyers with every one of my pygmies,, and the book I bought for my grandson before his first goat. Frank and descriptive, It describes everything! Feed, housing, picking out your goat to assisting with kidding, hoof trimming,vaccinations...this book has it all! I highly recommend!"
5,new goat owner handbook,"i recently gave my boyfriend a fainting goat, to join his aging wether which came with his rural property. he is from chicago, and knew nothing about the care, feeding, or otherwise necessary knowledge regarding goats. he has raved about this book, and is reading it cover to cover, sharing enthusiastically about his newly aquired knowledge. i also read it before giving it to him, and agree that although this book appears to be geared toward the younger owner, it is invaluable to anyone starting out as a goat owner, as well as a reference book for those needing reminders."
5,Rod Serling + Art Carney = MAGIC!,"Every time I watch this I tear up at the end.This was a hastily done show to get it done in time for Christmas. Serling himself said that there was a holiday spirit on the set, maybe because they had more children than usual on the set.Art Carney's acting ability makes this episode shine with the magic of the season.A must have for sentimentalists who still enjoy the Magic of Christmas."
3,not as shown in picture,"I expected a variety of bisquettes, as shown in the picture. Oak, Pecan,Apple, etc. But it just one type of special blend, whatever that is!When I order something I just expect things to be as represented."
1,Bradley Hickory Bisquettes 120 pack,"This is waste...1st:you need propane torch to start smoke on this(don't want to talk about Bradleysmoke generator,only 1/3 burns before is replaced with another biscquette)2nd:looks like hickory wood is mixed with some different kind of wood(its darker then normal,maybe I'm wrong but somethings is not right with this)3th:it's not a miracle why is so cheap instead original Bradley Hickory Bisquettesi was using 3 years in row without any cons,but this is garbage.I did not have choice because got 300 pounds of meet ready for smoker..got usethis with angry feeling...never again!!!"
5,Apple for Turkey,"I brined and smoked a small turkey using the apple wood. It seems that apple wood is a little sweeter and lighter in flavor and goes great with a light meat like turkey. This is the second one I have done like this in my Bradley Smoker, and there will definitely be more to come."
5,Bradley Hickory Bisquettes 120 pack Bradley Hickory Bisquettes 120 pack,fantastic products - will make your meat smoke flavor subtle yet yummy - not too much - and the large multi-pack ensures you wont run out in the middle of smoking
4,"Nice on the ears, but missing something? original material!","Plant's voice is not ruined as many would like to believe but is deep, rich and smooth. His versions of ""Song to the Siren"", ""Morning Dew"" and ""Hey Joe"" deserve recantion because they are beautiful and perfect. But all in all the album has such a bare old feel that almost seems like it was recorded in the 70's. ""Funny In My Mind"" sounds exactly like a zeppeling on page/plant song. Well the concept and album are work are perfect. the music is three stars, concept 1 star= 4 stars. Worth the money yes.."
4,In a different space ..,"I just picked this up today and I really like the album!! The mellow vibe and sultry sounds will take you away and there are moments that will remind you of times of old and make you smile. I think the band sounds really good and there are some great non traditional sounds (electronic ones included) and instruments on this record. Robert's voice is very good too, he sounds great in his current range and very comfortable singing the songs.Highlights on the album for me are: Fixin' to Die, Song to the Siren, Darkness, Darkness, Hey Joe, Win my Train Fare Home.I definitely would recommend this cd to everyone, it has some of Robert's best work on it!"
3,A strange album,"This one is a bit strange. On one hand I think it is a beautiful and brilliant, passionate album. On the other hand I think that he lost a bit of his power. What I miss here are new songs after so many years without doing it solo, and the frue fire he used to have, it is also sad to notice that his voice, THE voice of rock, is not what it used to be.But, can't wait for the next album, as this time he put a realy good band together. Sadly missing only is Michael Lee."
5,Great Listening Experience,"I was a bit apprehensive when I heard Robert Plant was doing an album of old songs.But fear not, he comes through. It's not an album of hit singles, instant rock out gratification or bump and grind metal.You need to listen to the whole thing to really connect with the vibe Plant is putting across. After a few listens it really grows on you. It has a psychdelic, melodic, trippy, 60's / 70's rock feel to it. And make no mistake it's definitely a rock album.Years from now fans will return to this album and the underrated but equally as great ""Fate of Nations"" for the definitive solo Plant. Just saw him in NYC and it was great. He really looks to be enjoying himself and that's what music is all about."
5,Psychadelic Blues,"This has to be one of my favorite Robert Plant releases. Sure I know its a cover album, but if that is bothering some people, they have to put it aside and grab this release. I have had this record since it first came out, and always seem to be coming back to it. What is amazing about it, is the restlesness of the songs. Very cutting edge psychadelics going on here. Seems like this record could have come out in the 1965-68 time period. Roberts voice is nowhere near the range he once had with Zep, but the songs match his strength on this record. I hope this is a continuing trend for him. Putting out discs that constantly challenge his audience ala Neil Young. And his band is top notch also."
1,WHAT HAPPENED??,This is by far one of the most disappointing CDs I have bought from an established artist. What the heck happened??
2,some have it other's don't,"robert plant the fantastic singer with the heavy rock band led zeppelin who in 1980 dis-banded due to the death of their drummer john bonham so led zeppelin went their different ways with jimmy page only doing a few collaboration albums here and there and the excellent ""no quarter"" unledded album with robert plantbut this my hard rocking friends is a dismal covers albumgod this songs are fantastic but robert's vocals and the whole musical escents sucks BIG time i've never listen too it all the way through...also i love folk rockthis is a below average album from the wail of a voicewell this album puts too rest that robert plant won't be reconstructing the days of led zeppelin in a hurrya damn shame really"
5,Dreamland,"Bought this album on the strength of the Youngblood's Darkness,Darkness hoping the rest would be at least as good.It is.Hendrix would appreciate the take on Hey Joe.I really enjoyed Plant and his musicians. Good stuff. Wish they had put their stamp on Procol Harum's A Salty Dog and included it here."
5,This CD is one of his best solo efforts in MANY years!,"The music is rich in sound and makes you want to wear headphones at night with no distractions. I recently started playing all my older Plant CDs and then found this one at the store and was BLOWN AWAY. Yes it's mainly cover songs but the production values are well worth the listen, and he does justice to Dylan's One More Cup of Coffee from the Desire album (my fave Dylan album). Morning Dew is a sad but beautifully done song, and Plant's interpretation of Hey Joe is quite different from the one we're used to ala Hendrix but if listened to on its own merits it is still very good, relying more on Plant's voice to build it up with the music mainly keeping the beat and rhythm until the lengthy bridge section then it goes very Led Zeppelin. All in all an excellent CD well worth taking time away from everyone and dusting off that big old set of headphones you may have laying around somewhere."
2,Weak...very weak.,"After months of reading reviews of RP's live performances, I was looking forward to the new release...and was hugely dissapointed. I've listened to it again and again..trying to find some hook..some jewel..but it's just a bunch of moaning..whining...its boring. Who in his right mind could condone this treatment of Hey Joe?..YIKES! I had to play Zep I and Fate of Nations for 2 days just to get Dreamland out my head.Robert..please go back in the studio...NOW..with a venomous guitar player and do what you do best...wail...not whine!...and we'll forget this ever happened."
2,2 songs don't make a CD,Morning Dew and Darkness Darkness are the only songs on this CD worth listing to. These to songs are exceptional but it's not enough to justify buying this CD.
2,Not Like His Last Album,"If you like (as I do) Plant's previous solo efforts, you won't necessarily go for this one. Plant's vocals are as good as ever, maybe even the best ever...but the songs don't rock. At all.After a solo career that had seen Plant get better and better with each album, I was really looking forward to this, his first solo release since 1993's Fate of Nations. I was disappointed."
4,Music is alive and its here.....,"Recent releases from Tom Waits, David Bowie, and now Robert Plant demonstrate that good quality music is alive and well.This is a great album. Period.Only weak point seems to be the recording. I cant understand why there is distortion at the start of the second track. Tape hiss (and a bit too prominent) on others. I also found the sound quality of Clarksdale lifeless. This music deserves better mastering."
4,Plant pleases...,"'Dreamland' is a superb album, proving that the guys I grew up with (Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, David Bowie) still beat the snot out of the muck that's vomitted daily on MTV. Plant doing a cover album seemed a little dubious to me until I listened to it. He pretty much owns 'Morning Dew' as far as I'm concerned. 'Darkness, Darkness' is my favorite song on the album & 'Song To The Siren' is one of the most beautiful melodies I've ever heard. Plant's take is reminiscent of 'The Rain Song' from his Led Zep days. Another song that's interesting to listen to is 'One More Cup of Coffee'. The White Stripes do a version of it too, & their take is how I would picture Plant doing it & vice versa. This album is as good as 'Fate of Nations' & a wonderful follow up to 'Walking Into Clarksdale'. Do yourself a favor & pick it up."
5,Uniquely Robert,"This album has a similar sound to his ""Fate of Nations"" CD. ""Darkness, Darkness"" and ""Song to the Siren"" really display his unique solo sound nicely. I saw him perform some of these songs in Chicago, and you can hear how his voice has improved with age. I only wish ""Sitting by the Window"" was included on this CD. He does a great cover of ""Hey Joe"" and the blues sound really comes through on ""Red Dress"". Well worth the 9 year wait."
3,Vanity of vanities all is vanity.,"With the darkened sun and black bodies disembarking on a distant shore on its cover, this is a theme album about death. The topic appears directly or indirectly in most of its songs. So if you are in the mood for something of that nature you will probably enjoy this. It is quite a valid artistic attempt in my opinion although some of the songs do plod along like a funeral march and Plants vocals are so whispery and croaky in places it sounds like someone singing from their death bed, perhaps this was done on purpose to increase the effect. The music is mainly a sort of folky rock with a couple of more noisy numbers thrown in for good measure. I remember getting this at succot (feast of the tabernacles) where we sit in temporary structures to remind us of the transience of life so it quite suited the situation really. Not recomended as party music."
3,Sibilance and harshness ruin terrific content,"This is a review of Robert Plant's ""Dreamland"" CD, which I purchased after watching Plant's performance during the Nobel Peace Prize Concert.A lot has already been said about the content of this CD and I am equally positive about it. What has me bewildered is the recording quality - the entire CD is overly bright. I mean, bright to the point of harshness that makes it painful to listen to. I have to turn the treble down quite a bit and it still can't compensate for the brightness and excessive sibilance in Plant's vocals (without upsetting the tonal balance).My audio system is reasonably high-end. I have also tried this CD on two other music systems, with similar results. I am tempted to pursue the matter with the recording company but hold no illusions that something will come of it.A shame, really, given how much I like Plant's performance."
2,Disappointed,"I have always looked forward to every new release by Robert Plant, but when I heard Dreamland, I almost broke into tears. It made me realize that larger-than-life music legends like Robert Plant also get older and the years begin to show in their vocals. Robert sounds very tired and threadbare. While this album was more ""accoustic"" than his other albums over the last ten to twenty years, it did him no favors to go for a more unplugged sound. He is going to have to rely more upon the magic of the recording studio now in order to remain salable.I am, sadly, not going to keep this CD, and it does very much bother me not to keep one of Robert Plant's works. However this work was a distinct disappointment."
1,VERY DISPOINTED,"HUGE FAN OF LED ZEPPLEIN AND ROBERT PLANT, THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST ALBUMS I'VE EVER BOUGHT, WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY"
1,dreamland,Dull.....Robert Plant should stick with what he knows best...rockThis cd is the cure for insomnia....
2,"ok, but not great.",I bought this mainly for the long version of Roll Over Beethoven. I knew this wasn't elo's best before I bought it. I just wanted to have it for that Chuck Berry classic.
1,Horrible!,"I bought this disc hoping for pristine remastered sound and what I got was shrill noise with all the hiss sucked out. The guy who typed a review in all caps is a moron! It's better than an MFSL disc because the artist approved it? Yeah right! Get real! I might need a new hi-fi if I don't like the sound? Please! You idiots know nothing about what good sound quality is and either does Peter Mew or Rob Caiger. Thanks for nothing!Sony should be sued by people who bought this horrible disc for deceptive practices...saying that the full-length version of ""Roll Over Beethoven"" was used! What a crock! And so what if they used the original master tapes? Using a master tape doesn't mean anything if you're going to smother it in noise processing and master it poorly!Don't buy this disc! Hang onto the old US versions, or even better, the Japanese issue. Don't give Sony your money for this shambles of a product!"
5,Awesome!!,Since 1980 American players have been waiting for a comprehensive book on the most common Super Grandmaster Opening in chess today. This book is big and covers everything! Common lines to hardly ever seen methods. If you use e4 or play the Sicilian this book is manditory!
3,It's ok,"I recently purchased a Yamaha SV-200 and the dealer provided the bag. It works pretty well, fits the silent violin. My only issue with it is that it can't fit the full size bow that I bought along with it.http://www.amazon.com/Full-size-Pernambuco-Nickel-silver-Mounted/dp/B003HPQDYC/ref=sr_1_1?s=musical-instruments&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1341119729&sr;=1-1It juts out by about an inch so I can't close the slot. Minor inconvience but the bag is really well built, just for a silent violin/ not full sized bow."
2,Topos are good,This is not a topo map...and it tells you that...but after trying to use this one in the field I'll go for a topo map anytime. They are just more helpfull.
2,Not What I Expected But Not Bad,"This is a panoramic map -- not a topo map. It is, in my opinion, of little use in hiking."
2,Middle School Art Project,"Name is a misnomer, it's not a 'hiker's map at all. Dont know what I was expecting, but something more than free hand drawing of 'nice mountains', altho the color coding of difficulty on trails may be helpful to some. Descrip was of a 3D map, and that's true, but with GoogleMaps and other online details of the earth these days, this belongs in early childhood education. There should be one of those ""look inside"" things from Amazon to ward off unsuspecting buyers. Just possibly not enough detail for a hike to get one lost, and that in a map, is NEVER a good thing. Pretty, yes. Useful, no."
5,Deceptive box creates astonishing sound,"Reviewer: An electronics fan from Oak Park, IL United StatesI walked into my sister's home yesterday and was surprised to hear her living room full of rich orchestral sound. She is no audiophile, so I skeptically glanced around the room for high-tech speakers, when my eyes caught this fun retro-styled radio. Having seen the Model One in a specialty shop the week before, I immediately remembered the reviews that I read of the product, and was dazzled. While the windows did not shudder at the sound of it, the speakers reproduced a hearty bass range of the cellos and a cystal-clear TINGGGG! of the triangle during the Christmas carol that was playing. I can't believe that somehing that costs so little can create such sound. I went and bought my own immediately and am deeply impressed with both its reception in the city and its tonal brilliance. Even without stereo, this must be heard to be believed."
4,The Best up to '95.,This s a good overall album is you like Vince Gill. An added bonus is his duet with Dolly Parton of the massive 'i Will Always Love You'. Forget the RCA recordings and stick to his MCA years. Soon be time for a Vol 2 greatest hits I would think. Check out his guitar playing.
5,His Very Best,"What I look for in any album (by any artist), I found in this one -- enjoyment of every song in it. His ""Look at Us"" is one of the very best! I am a Vince Gill fan, but this album is outstanding by any measurement!"
4,Different from others,"On previous reviews I mentioned that generally I don't like 90'sCountry Music since they mostly are POP orientated with a lot ofhard-rock electric guitar playing instead of the traditional pedalor steel guitar. This CD with some of the greatest hits by Vince Gillis more traditional country-like with one special feature I reallylove within Country Music: the blues, that means country blues.There are some really great country blues tunes that became CMAsongs of the year like ""When I Call Your Name"", ""Look At Us"" and""Not The Future In The Past"". Besides these there are also a lot ofother #1 hits especially ""I Still Believe In You"" (another CMA songof the year) + his biggest hit ever ""Don't Let Our Love Start SlippinAway"". A real great and well sought after compilation."
3,Not Much Geology of Lake Superior,"The book is technically quite good, but there is too much emphasis on Wisconsin geology. The cover photo is of Palisade Head along the north shore of Lake Superior and there is very little mention of the Geology of the North Shore."
5,Perfect!,"My old Oster Kitchen Center mixing bowl was glass and, through the years had become chipped around the top edge. I ordered the stainless steel replacement bowl and am very pleased. It's a perfect fit and I don't have to worry about cutting myself on the bowl any more. Thanks!"
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH CANON LENSES!!!,"Description of this product is incorrect. This teleconverter will ONLY MOUNT TAMRON LENSES ON A CANON CAMERA BODY!!!!The instructions included with the teleconverter specification notes state ""This device is designed specifically for use with Tamron lenses. It is not compatible with other lenses.""This is in direct conflict with the Amazon description ""Tamron AF 2X Teleconverter for Canon mount lenses""I am in the process of returning the teleconverter. It was very disappointing Xmass present."
4,Tamron teleconverter,"nowhere in the item description did it state "" this teleconverter is not designed for digital use"" It does work with my XTi/ tamron lens"
1,Not as advertised,"Description of this product is incorrect. This teleconverter will ONLY MOUNT ON A CANON CAMERA BODY NOT LENS!!! You cannot mount your lens back on. So you actually need to buy a lens as well. And to make it worse, BEACH CAMERA WILL NOT ACCEPT MY RETURN. Going to fight it. But if you think you're buying this for your Canon and you're all set, think again."
2,could be better,"Very dry reading. Of all my CNC class books, this one is definitely the most boring to read. The graphics could be better, as well. An example, there is a diagram of a engine lathe. There were tons of names and arrows to the parts, however, the diagram was so small, you needed a magnifying glass to see what they were pointing at. Either explode some parts, then label them, or have the diagram take up the entire page."
1,Can someone please write a better book!,"This book needs to be completely scrapped and rewritten from scratch by someone who reads their own definitions and illustrations. Example: The definition of ""resolution"" refers to hand width at one point, to band width at another point, and the drawings contradict both of these.A plea: Would someone who has experience in the field please write a better book?"
5,great service,I was in a hurry for this book so I chose an express option. The book arrived even sooner than I expected.
5,ENGAGING ENTHUSIAMS,"Here is a book, at long last, that does not derive its energy from sniping at authors. Rather, Dirda has read everything (EVERYTHING) and will tell you which humor, sci fi, mystery, romance, intellectual history, european bildugsroman, thrillers, well, I could go on for a while -- which ones are worth reading. His descriptions are exact, his enthusiasm enlivening, and as a reader of his for several years, I can attest that his recommendations are spot on. Here is a book to live with -- it is that good. My only criticism is that it will leave you with an ever lengthening shelf of books you are eager to read!"
3,Good for those traveling to Croatia,"This book & audio tapes are useful for those who are traveling in Croatia and need to know tourist information. The tapes are great to learn the pronunciations. However, this book & tape combination is not for those who want to learn and become fluent in the language."
1,there is no such thing as serbo croatian language,there is NO such thing as SERBO CROATIAN language! these two are separate languages and should not be mixed.unfortunately there are too many people who are not aware of this fact and ignore it.so please take it into consideration before you buy this artificial language dictionary!
3,Nice book but little about the cards,"The book is nice. Has a lot of information but nothing that directly deals with the images in the Mayan Tarot Deck which is the main reason I wanted it. I was rather let down on this, for while the divinatory meanings are more elaborate than the LWB (little white book) that comes with the deck, they are nothing but traditional Golden Dawn astrological associations and meanings. I think if you are interested in Mayan History there are better books out there.The Mayan Oracle: A Galactic Language of Lightby Spilsbury or her earlier oracle deck The Mayan Oracle: Return Path to the Stars [With 44 Full-Color Cards] [BOXED-MAYAN ORACLE, alas she did no tarot,will inform you more of the traditions and symbols of the civilization than this. Don't let this deter you from the deck though, it's superb. It's just unfortunate Balin does not share his thoughts for why he chose what pictograms he did for the cards."
4,I like Todd,"but I'm baffled by this CD. The first track listed is ""Elmo and Henry"", but track 1 is just some short, faint instrumental. The lyrics to ""Elmo and Henry"" are in the CD liner, but no such song on the CD. Also, the liner contains lyrics to two songs titled ""Dance, Dance, Dance"" and ""Promises to Keep"", but again, no such songs on the CD. What is on the CD are some pretty cool songs by a talented wordsmith and musician. I highly recommend it! Just can't make sense of what's in the liner and what is and isn't on the actual CD."
4,Useful,"This dictionary is far more detailed than anything else that most of us can afford. It has a large vocabulary. Welsh words are defined in both Welsh and English. The definitions are, regretably, quite brief. For anyone but the exceptionally curious (stubborn, crazy) student trying to muddle through early Welsh literature, this dictionary is ample. Since, the last time I checked, the Welsh equivalent of the O.E.D. was likely to run over $400 plus shipping, I'll stick with this volume for a while"
5,A Concise Book About Women's Health,"This is a wonderful book for any woman from Teens to Age 100! It is like sitting down and having a chat with a friend who happens to be a doctor. There is no stuffiness, institutional reading but a concise place to learn about what is happening to your body as a woman ages, what tests she needs and what the results could be and possibly mean without causing panic. The reader doesn't feel like she is either being spoke down to or that the information is so technical, it flies over one's head.The reader is not only treated to knowledge to empower her to good health to grow old by but the material is also practically related in Dr. Reichman's sharing of her own stories.I think this is a must have for any woman's personal library!"
3,The only thing that bothered me about this book....,"... is that it is sectioned off according to age groups, like 20s, 30s, 40s, and so forth... which makes it difficult to pin- point a particular topic that you're interested in UNLESS it just happens to fall in your catagory OR you read the book from cover to cover. The layout of the book also suggests that if you are in your 20s, you need not worry about facing the types of probelsm listed for women in their 30s, which may not necessarily be true in all cases... It depends on the individual health profile of each female..."
2,School Business Administration: A planning Approach,I have never read so many simple concepts written in such a convoluted and verbose style. The authors seem more intent on showing off than on communicating effectively.
3,"Sort of a ""bi-coastal romance"" type thing","Nice job by these two together. I like this album better than any of their respective solo dates that I've heard. But on the used promo copy that I picked up, Russell Malone sounds like he's playing in the next room from the recording studio. I'd like to think that was corrected on the commercial release, but I doubt it."
2,Poor sound mars a great performace,"Great sound can't make a poor performance better, but bad sound can sure hurt a great one. Such is the case with Bluebird. Green turns in another great performance only to have it wrecked by the recording engineer. The piano mics are so poorly positioned that there are severe phase problems. This isn't a subjective judgment. Mono the two channels together and you get cancellation, rendering the CD almost unlistenable. Proper phase is 101 in recording. How Green and his producer selected an engineer that can't properly mic a two instrument performance is a mystery. This has got to be the worst sounding major jazz release in years. Two instruments and the guy screws it up. Please Mr. Engineer find another occupation that doesn't require listening skills.I would have given this four stars if the recording wasn't so bad."
3,"great playing, terrible sound","Benny Green's playing has matured nicely, and the arrangements with Russell Malone are first-rate, with both players swinging and surprising. A terrific effort by the musicians is ruined by the sound quality. Another reviewer noted the poor engineering, but Malone himself had to turn his guitar all the way to the bass to make it sound as if he is underwater. What a waste of a great session! Re-master it and it's five stars."
1,NO DOUBT THE WORST ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!,"There are absolutely no good song on the CD.The only reason to buy this CD is if you have a sleeping problem,it will put you out cold within the first 5 minutes of listening.For any other reason than that,stay away from this horrible album!!!"
1,Tacticalboard?,"The main problem is that time [between keys] cannot be edited. With long chains of keys one must be able to actually press the keys, a feat often impossible, and editing of time is not included.The Nostromo N50, while only ten keys, does support editing of time and seems to be faster."
4,Amazing saga of poor management and lack of design direction,"For anyone who has worked in multimedia, or a movie or other creative collaborative project, Fred Moody's account of a Microsoft team developing a children's reference CR-ROM may be oddly comforting. Moody gives an objective account and avoids making judgements, but the lack of direction provided by the project leaders makes you want to jump into the story and say, ""Really, you should finish the design before writing the code"" and other such statements. Still, the individual personalities and group dynamics captured by Moody make for a surprisingly compelling story. Bill Gates also makes an impressive appearance"
3,A pale shadow of his other work.,"After indulging in this author's other work, ""Fighting Chance,"" this was a little disappointing. I missed the quotes from 19th century Russian literature"
2,Eagles flying high and low,"Just like half the human population I guess, I've been an Eagles fanatic for the longest 30 years...actually when they aired Hotel C. Since they broke up in the late seventies, I've been hunting for every single piece of new material, but I must say this one is pretty boring. Nice vocals,(you would expect so anyway),but too repetitive, with an impression of ""been there already"". I would rather strongly recommend the new 2CD album. That's where you will find them flying high again.."
1,Hole belongs in a deep hole.,"Some of the bad lyrics: How can people be so blind? - Like who? YOURSELF!! Fussing and fighting over who will be annointed-people are not fussing and fighting, they are being blown apart and dying!! If you want to roll over and give up everything our people have fought and died for, GO AHEAD! Donate all you've got to the peace lovers and I'll move into your house and take over your family. I'm all for peace, but this weak-minded garbage sounds like bending over and liking it. So are you saying you dont care who the leader of the free/not free world is? Well heck, run this tune over and over around the globe and convince everybody it doesn't matter, then just give the world to me! Thanks."
2,Be Wary,"This is only a CD-single and should be listed as such. This song is available as a bonus CD on the DVD-single release, which you can get for less. As for the band: Outstanding. The song: outstanding. The price: rip off."
3,hole in the world dvd,I bought the hole in the world dvd/cd set.After listening to it I was a little disappointed it wasn't recorded in dts and the snippets of them recording the song and their farewell tour.I had hoped to see more of them. The recording was in BLACK AND WHITE :( . They did not sing the whole song through on the dvd which was also dissapointing. I have to say I love the song it was a nice change for them.You can hear the song on the cd that comes with it.
5,"A very, very good book!","There are many books out there written on Windows 2003, including the ones published by the Microsoft Press, but Bill's book stands out easily. The simple reasons are: Bill is a very, very good, writer, and his techincal knowledge is so obvious. I'm glad to find out that Bill, unlike many other authors, ddidn't pull the stuff from the online help, paraphased them and called them his own, but from his own practical experience, and know-how.I strongly recommend this book to everyone."
3,decent book but . . .,Decent practical reference but there is one glaring problem. It's not written on the final release. Look on . . .
1,odd little book,"This book is an apparent attempt to provide comfort and meaning for those bereft in the 9/11 disaster, culminating in a long address by God to those who died in the airplanes and their attendant destruction. It's not great writing, and the dialog is predictable. Nor is it theologically satisfying--the only criterion addressed at the ""judgment"" scene is whether those who had died were among the 19 hijackers.Some will find this a reassuring effort. However, it is limited in scope and flawed in delivery."
1,you must be joking,"This is truly a gag book. From the font and the spacing to the intro to the plot, it is a 'first book' from an author who, unfortunately, does not have a future in writing. Please do not impulsively purchase this because it's cheap, like I did...unless you want a good laugh."
4,"""The Convention""","A must read book for everyone that beleives in a Supreme Being, has Faith and Beleives in it. Very mysterious with a riviting tribute to the end.""Harry"""
1,Was not compatible,"Looking to replace remote eaten by dog. This was not compatible. With no packing slip, there's not way to return item. It's the first time i've been disappointed by Amazon and affiliates."
5,This is Really a Very good all around remote control.,"This is Really a Very good all around remote works damn near on everything,i have even opened a garage door with it ,actually a couple of them even turned on lighting, stereo's and the list go's on,i found that out by just playing with it.Its tough and reliable, honestly i thank this 8.0 uhf remote is really underestimated and overlooked, because of the 6.3 Ir/uhf & 6.4 Ir/Uhf seems to get the lime light. i would recommend it, if you don't like it return it. i hope dish network starts using them again especially do to the abundance and price."
2,I prefer CA diaries,"Ann M. Martin seems to know a lot more about teenagers in California than she does in the BSC. Dances in the 8th grade are nothing like the BSC's. Also, Mary Anne and Logan have been going out for TEN YEARS NOW! And they've only broken up once. I used to be an avid BSC fan, but it got pretty stupid. Now I read the CA diaries and I love it. The early BSC books were great...but not really anymore I think."
2,It's getting old...,I have to agree with Spacecat...the Babysitters have been in 8th grade for about ten years now. Oooo-kay. I used to read these books all the time but lately they seem really preposterous.
1,History Proves Briggs Wrong,"Briggs has missed the point. It is the orthodox women religious, from Mother Tearesa's Missionaries of Charity to the Nashville Dominicans that have experienced an explotion since Vatican II while those orders who have (miss)interpreted church teaching in un-orthodox way have declined to nothing. Briggs does a noble job of trying to rationalize his politics, but fails to understand the overwhelming facts before him."
4,Compelling narrative,"Well researched history of the Vatican's treatment of women religious.For me, a real eye-opener. Really drives home the extent of the egregious treatment of these devoted people at the hands of entitled men who despised them.A must read for those interested in the topic."
4,Interesting,"Have found this book to be very interesting. There has been way too much cover up within the Catholic Church, maybe if people would open their mouths more not so many people would have been hurt."
1,Double Crossed,Still waiting to receive Double Crossed: Uncovering the CAtholic Church's Betrayal of American Nuns. Another betrayal! Can't provide a critique without the material.
2,Warning Direct TV will not connect this product,"The item can't be connected to Direct TV because it is part of ""a very large bill"" says Direct TV customer service. Unless you want a paper weight it has no value. I contacted the seller, but have received no reply. Beware..."
5,Fabulous overview on building a budget engine,"I needed to build a stong motor on the cheap, and this was the guide I was looking for. He tells you all the little tricks, and tips that you need to know to build a strong competent motor without spending too much money. I highly recommend it."
1,Faded & Torn after 90 days,"I ordered two banana leaf covers for my teak chaise lounge chairs this past spring- 2011. Based on the reviews of the product, I figured it would be a great all-weather chair cover. After only 90 days of the sun & rain on my deck, both covers have faded to a gray color. One of the covers actually has a tear in the top of it. Needless to say, I now have to buy new covers. I am very disappointed with this product."
4,An entertaining send-up of academia.,"In the vein of ""Moo"", this book sends up several academic types, each in their own search for Emily Bronte at a conference dedicated to her in England. The writer manages to be touching, as well as funny, in her portrayal of the characters' relationships."
1,Only for huge fans of Emily Bronte,"I tried very hard to get into this description of four rather different people who have one thing in common: an obsession with Emily Bronte. They meet at a conference about her work and just....well, I had hoped the book would get interesting when they finally meet, but it really didn't. I gave up and skimmed to the end. Quite disappointing, actually. I didn't identify with or care about any of the characters, and, as it turns out, I don't really care about Emily Bronte."
4,Book is Oversimplified,"This good book is too simplified. Layout and generous screen captures are good, but some graphics are too cute. I learned several things from it, but the audience for this book is on par of a ""dummies"" book. Word beginners could get better value with a book with more tips and advanced features without the fear of getting lost."
4,Foot lotion,I ordered this foot lotion because I like the scent of peppermint & plum. It does smell very good and goes on easily. I have not found it in any stores as of yet but the shipping costs were higher then the actual cost of the product.
3,It's OK,"A fairly heavy lotion that did help soften. The scent, however, was pretty strong & very sweet. My daughter said it smelled like bubblegum. Luckily, that shouldn't be too much of a problem since not a lot of people go around smelling others' feet!"
5,"one of the best moisturizers for tired, freshly exfoliated feet....","This lotion has a great scent (peppermint and plum), and also invigorates your skin. Peppermint has the botanical property of cooling hot skin, and this lotion definitely gets the job done. It's also great for your legs, after you've just come out the of shower. Be sure to use Freeman's Foot Soak, the Freeman Exfoliant (I reccomend you stick to the same scent as the lotion), and then follow with the Bare Foot Softening Lotion. This stuff is great."
4,Wonderful Stories; Great Reference,"This book has great stories and well organized reference for finding other similar stories. It also has an introduction to storytelling to teens. The author seems a little out of touch with teens or assumes the reader will be, but overall, it is good."
3,You get what you pay for,Mildly disappointed with this cartridge. Was very difficult to 'open' (didn't realize that I had to take the 'lid' off to remove a seal; the directions say nothing about that). Basically wasted one of them trying to get it to work before I realized the trick. Better to buy Epson original cartridges.
5,Title Says it All,"Michael Bono's book is an invaluable resource for working electrolgists to become familiar with the blend-or to review and expand their current knowledge. Clear, easy to read charts and graphs make for quick references, and the illustrations are well coordinated with the text to provide insight and explanation of concepts. For the working electrologist (permanent hair removal-not metallurgy) it's one of the first books to pull from the shelf for questions and guidelines."
3,electrolysis platting,well......i need information how does electrolysis platting works in chemical reaction.For example i used a solution pf silver chloride and i got a spoon to plate.In the +ve terminal i got iron rod.What will happen if i used silver spoon if the solution that i used didnt change?meaning i'm still using silver chloride solution.Will the spoon dissolved or else? this is the question that i try to find in this book but it seems that it only shows a little information about electrolysis platting.
1,For Real?,I'd like to see an image of this one since ACE only published up to #120! Sure you didn't get the number wrong?
3,Block this party,"Easy warm-up for their popular full length debut, this EP remains pretty unnecessary for all but the obsessed simply from very little compelling material remaining exclusively on here."
4,Was great while waiting....,"I was waiting for the complete record to be released earlier this summer and this was the only record that I was able to buy to satisfy my Bloc Party cravings. It is still worth having as the ""Marshalls"" is somewhat unlike the rest of their work."
3,"Heard 100 times before, unless you're the people below","Bloc Party make competent genre music which never really transcends its reference points: Gang of Four, Wire, blah (all listed below). How many times you can hear the aforementioned bands reinterpreted, I don't know. Quite a few, I guess. Yawn."
4,A Good Read!,"Lilly Walters focuses on the success stories of 19 top speakers and their hints for speaking well. She highlights their backgrounds, turning points and key sayings, and then provides tips on becoming a top speaker using their methods for developing and giving effective presentations. Hearing what these speakers say about the principles of good speechmaking is interesting, but their ""insider"" tips are pretty obvious, even to an outsider. Most of their advice is widely known within the speaking industry and is presented here repetitively. Don't be put off by the ""read this resume"" nature of the initial introductions, because they put the speakers in context and show their success. We [...] recommend this book to virgin public speakers or those who want a refreshing booster, to those who book big-name talkers, or to those who like to read recreationally about celebrities and their ideas."
3,Needed better editing and organizing,"This book imparts many pearls of wisdom, however it could have been better edited and organized. It is presented in a way which does not help the reader organize their thoughts and approach."
2,grommets missing,"Product appearance is good. However, three of four corners have no grommets. There are grommets along the edges every two feet or so. I would describe the poly rope in the border as poly twine. I am using it to protect my boat cover from UV in the bright Colorado sun (7400 foot elevation). We'll see how it stands up to the elements."
3,I love Jessica,"I believe I have all the Murder, She Wrote paperbacks with Donald Bain. They are every one enjoyable. This is not my favorite, but I'm glad I bought it. For all of us who commute by public transportation the Murder, She Wrote paperbacks are perfect."
5,Extraordinary lens for the price,"Using a Canon Digital Rebel, sold my 28-135mm lens for this lens. Quality is superior. Is almost at the Canon ""L"" series level. It's lighter, more compact & weighs less. Very satisfied with the photos I've taken. A serious contender."
5,A gift from heaven,"Excellent album, great voice, singing wonderfull compositions by Chris Rea. On first listen, it took me by surprise, incredibly powerful melodies with a voice to compliment them perfectly. This CD possesses the magic to touch you the first time you listen to it and the feeling will just not go away. Track 1 and 4 are gems but there is not a bad track on this CD. Sarah and Chris deserve much more airplay and commercial backing her in Canada and America. Its a shame that they do not get more exposure here. Jazee Blue and Chris Rea have supported a bright new talent in Sarah Randle and appear interested in producing good music. Cudos to them. Commercial success will follow eventually. Don't expect to find this in your local store, go out and order it now. You will not be disappointed. Absolutely fabulous..."
4,Not bad for a textbook,"If you have to read a textbook, this one is more readable than most, which is kind of the point since it's about not relying on textbooks to teach reading. Written in more of a story-telling vignette kind of style than straight pedagogy. Also, chapters are very short, as is the whole book."
5,A must for any teacher,Every secondary teacher should read this! Great ideas and hard to put down. I will be recommending it to many of my colleagues.
5,Worth it,"The description on this one doesn't go into much detail, but I've been happy with Patricia Rice books in the past and decided to give this one a shot. I have to say that if you like her other books you'll like this one as well. It tells the story in her style with a nice heroine that's not too shy to stand up for herself (my fave)this one's worthy of a read (or two) imo"
1,"Unreadable, BORING",I could only struggle through 140 pages of this horrible book. Doesn't even deserve 1 star.
1,Not my cup of tea. Boring Gothic.,"This is my first book by Ms. Rice & I shudder to try another. I have a distinct aversion to Gothic romances & I was misled by the blurb on the back cover into paying full price for this. Still, I finished this one hoping the story would get better--it didn't. Maybe longtime a fan of PR's might appreciate this more."
5,"So ""Dog Garn"" Cute","My one year old daughter loves this book. She constantly points to each dog and says ""doggie"". And now she is starting to point out their noses, etc. She loves this book so much it is about to fall apart and I plan to buy a new one to replace it. I have a degree in photography and was introduced to William Wegman in my photo classes.I have other coffee table books by him and am thrilled he has books and videos for children so my daughter can enjoy his dogs for years! A must have for kids and dog lovers!"
1,just let go already,"The third wave agenda in an attempt to defend it's modern day merrit, in the face of ""post-modern"" critics, has only succeeded in promoting ""post-modern feminism"". The arguments made are proof enough that the third wave is out of touch with the current direction in feminism."
4,I like it,I like the I idea of dean making a crooked way of winning the car and of course Jerry is always the one who will always come up being the other guy having the other ticket
5,It's all been said,"Great product. Does what it says. Do yourself a favor and buy these because you cannot get COC certified with anything else. And who wouldn't want to be certified in a category similar to Magnus Samuelsson and other strong men?Actually when I got my #2 I was able to close it once the first time. Do yourself a favor like someone already mentioned, have #1 mastered by being able to do several sets of 10 of #1 or at least close to it. My personal goal is to close #3 some day and maybe beyond."
3,Expect Blisters,"This really is a great product, but with one annoying flaw. I've been working out for years and started with the #1 which was perfect. I can just about close it 10 times per set and I already feel the difference in my grip strength when I do heavy lifts at the gym.However, the issue with the abrasiveness of the handles is a very true and annoying one that you won't realize until you really start using it. I read the other reviews before purchasing and thought people were just exaggerating but it's true.I definitely don't have soft, girly hands but I developed blisters on my fingers that caused me to have to stop using it for a while to let them heal.Maybe I'll develop tougher calluses, but until then, it sucks to not be able to use it as often as I'd like to."
3,"""all gripper"" ratings should be taken with a grain of salt.","According to ironminds website, the lbs rating for these grippers is approximate. That's fine. So it says it's 140lbs to close, could be anywhere from 120-160 in reality. But then they go on to state that this is true of all grippers and not just there's and imply that it's the fault of science and not manufacturing. Sorry Ironmind, but I'm quite sure that there exists the science and methods to make a gripper that can match it's performance rating. Just think of all the parts and machinery used in manufacturing or in the building of things like, I dunno, jet fighter planes. Are you telling me that all their building specifications and subsequent results are just approximate? Just admit it, your operation isn't hi-tech, but then don't go making the bold and dishonest claim that your problem is a fault of science and that no gripper can be made to perfect performance specifications.With that aside, the gripper has worked well so far."
5,"Wow, what a difference!","At first, I was really skeptical because of the price. Similar looking hand grips had reviews that complained of peeling plating on the metal, loose grips, etc. However, price aside, these are head and shoulders above anything else I've tried.The spring is very sturdy compared with other grippers.The handles are a lightweight aluminum and have a very fine machined grip grid (like very fine sandpaper that doesn't tear up the hands. The handles are attached very strongly to the spring. I can detect no wiggle or give at all. They are also very thoughtfully machined and precision rounded and stamped on the end. I mean, if hand grips can be considered a work of art, then these fit the bill.As stated, these are USA made, which I appreciate.If you're looking for the best gripper out there, look no further."
4,"Great for strength building, but watch the humidity","After getting frustrated with the crushers I found in various sports shops because they were too easy, I decided to get a #1, #1.5 and #2.These things are awesome. They really train your strength! When I got them, I could barely close the #1, but over the months, I can now do a couple reps on the #2 (Don't cheat though - you gotta TOUCH the sides to each other), and am thinking of getting a #2.5 at some point.However, you want to be careful where you live. I brought these over to Malaysia (tropical, near the equator) - and the humidity just made the springs rust on all of them. So keep them somewhere dry! That's the only complaint I have about them. Otherwise, they're made to high quality standards!"
4,Captains of Crush--Excellent Hand Grip Strengh!,"I am really enjoying using the ""Captains of Crush"" hand grips and my hand and forearm strength is alreadyshowing vast improvement! I am using the COC along with some jelly balls and guitar finger grips and of course I am exercising with weights. Overall, the COC grippers are MUCH better than any you may find in stores so I use those for warm ups and the Captains of Crush Grippers for SERIOUS STRENGTH training!Thanks for an excellent product and thanks for the quick delivery,Michael Twomey"
5,Great Product,"If you can do the plastic time wasters 50-100 reps, the trainer (100lb) will be a challenge to get 10 reps. Excellent product. Get rid of the girlie hands."
4,TAPE THE GRIP!!!,"Whatup! The fist thing I noticed once I had these things in my hand was the build quality. These things are impressive! They feel as though they will last much longer than a human lifespan. They are almost perfect, with the exception of one design flaw. Unless you have the hands of a farmer, the sandpaper grip will tear the skin of your fingers if you squeeze it several times in a row, but fear not! In my genius, I found the solution,lol. I just wrapped both handles in electrical tape, but the handle that rests against your palm slips around when you squeeze, so I removed the tape from one handle. Just grab it so the tape is against your fingers."
4,100 lb not easy for me,"Pretty much like everyone else said, this is tough to squeeze. The grips are rough on the hands. However, there is no doubt in my mind it will make your grip stronger if used regularly. It will take me a while before I can squeeze it with ease and move up to the next level."
5,"It's true, high quality..","So, like everyone has said, this thing really is well made.I bought a #1 to improve grip strength which has recently failed me while doing deadlifts. The only problem is that this thing is almost TOO high quality. I've had the #1 for a couple of weeks and I'm ready to move on. It might've been smarter economically to buy a cheaper grip trainer that breaks within a month, as that's all the use I really needed out of it. Having said that, I'm just about to order a CoC #2. I have no doubt I'll be working with that one a bit longer!As far as where to start, I've been lifting weights for a few months (overhand grip failed at 320 lb. deadlift) and #1 was not difficult."
5,GRIP,"These things are awesome. I've been weight training for a while but never really focused on my grip, thinking I got enough grip work from just hold onto a bar. However, I've been using these things 2x per week for about 4 weeks now and my grip strength has improved substantially. I initially bought the #1's but that was overly ambitious, and now I own the Sport, Trainers, 0.5s, and #1s. I use the Sport for a warm-up and the others for my work sets. I wasn't able to close the #1s with my right or left hand when I first bought them, but after working consistently with the lighter weights, I can now close the #1 with relative ease."
3,It Squeaks,The resistance is fine and all but after a few weeks of use the grips make a very audible squeaking when compressed.On the positive side I found the grip texture to be just right. I don't have rugged hands and I still did not find them to be too abrasive or require gloves. In fact I think gloves would be a hindrance.
4,Built to last.,"These things do not wear out, or ""season"" like some say they do. I am progressing in grip strength almost solely due to these grippers. I can currently close the #1.5, and I feel much stronger. A few months ago, The trainer was hard for me to close. I went from very weak to beyond the crushing grip most men in a short time."
4,NOTE: Will hurt your hand,"These are great. I'll give credit when credit is due. But darn, they hurt my hands. I usually put on my lifting gloves when I use these. The little grooves in the handle stick into my weak hands and cause extreme discomfort and with gloves, i'm able to use them without worry about my hands getting hurt. I read the reviews and bought both the Trainer and the Level 1. I figured i'd do the Trainer as a warm up and then do the Level 1. Boy was I wrong. The Trainer was hard. Eventually I got used to the trainer and I now use the trainer as a warm up and i'm on the Level 1. I'm not sure how long i'll be on Level 1 before I move up but I love them. They seem like they'll last for years. Built really sturdy. Nothing looks like it'll rust. I don't know what can be done about the grips other than strengthen the skin on your palms."
2,Way easier to close than I thought,"I have the 100lb and though I could in the past, I can barely close it now, so I wanted something to do more reps on. I definitely should've gone with the 80lb instead. No fault of IronMind, but this gripper is so easy to close, it's not even worth buying. It is the equivalent of a cheap gripper from any generic sporting good store. Maybe it's a little more swank-looking, but seriously, what does it matter? You can pay $5 or you can pay $25 for the same thing.I don't think I can return this as the grippers come in a hard shrink-wrapped package that once opened destroys the backing. So just a word of warning in case you were considering using this as a builder to the 100#. Buy the 80# instead, and a cheapo if you need to build up to that."
2,Too costly for functionality,HelloI saw some grip products from a copany like grip or sth which were similar and in the range of 6 bucks.This one does what it is intended to do just that too costly for the job i paid above 20 and lil bit on the higher side for what it does....Thanks
5,A good starter if your new or have fairly weak hands,"If your in decent shape or healthy these shouldn't be too hard to close. I use them as a warm up and my girlfriend can close them for a few reps.Quality. Good. I don't expect these things to break anytime soon, they appear very solid.TIP: The grip WILL callous your hand hands if you have smooth hands. If for whatever reason that is your own you don't want callous here is what I did.Someone suggested using bandage tape, but I found overhand grip wrapping to be great (used on the handle of a tennis racket). These will stop your hands from getting any callous but you still have to do all the work. ""Microzorb or Tourna Grip Tennis Overgrip"" I use Tourna but either should be fine."
4,Alot harder than a normal gripper,"I purchased the trainer with almost no previous grip training. Although i did some weight lifting, i could not close the gripper one full time. It has been about 2 weeks and i can close it still only 3 full times. Even though i can't close it i still can close it as far as possible for about 12 times, or i close it as far as possible once and hold it 10-30 seconds. Even though the Trainer is supposed to be easy compared to all the other ones, it is alot harder than the normal gripper, which i can close about 40 times for 3 sets (i did this once about a week before i got this one). So the point is if you have little grip training get this one and a lighter one so you don't just have one hard one. Also, one bad thing about the gripper is that it squeaked the instant i first used it, and squeaks alot more now."
4,Captains of Crush No. 2,I have a C of C No. 1. I was able to close it a few times when I first got it and then went up to about 12 reps. I then bought the No. 2. I have had it almost a month and I still cannot close it completely. There is a big jump in level of effort between the No. 1 and the No. 2. I am considering getting the 1.5.
5,Best Gripers on the MARKET!!!!,"These crushes are EXCELLENT. I at first bought Number 2 underestimating my own strenght but I couldnt close that so I moved down to a Number 1 but also couldnt close that then finally here I am settled at Trainers, these are hard and unlike the store bought plastic do not BREAK, all in all these grips give you a real workout.I do recommend buying leather gloves or any biking gloves with these since the metal does take toll on your skin and eventually really damages it."
4,wow,"just got them today & i have to say first these things are the real deal, i've played with hand grips for yrs. but never did any training with them. like other reveiws stated if u are not a workout & grip training freak start out with the lowest weights, everybody says get the trainer but that even takes allot of strength if u (like me) just started with this type of workout. I say get the sport 60 or 80lb. gripper befor the trainer. if u have done this befor then get the trainer and work your way up. they are rough on the hands, i double wraped some electrical tape around them it helps a little. I always say i have hands like bear paws and my pinky barely fits on the grip (but 4 me thats normal) 4 me its easier if u hold them up side down and use them."
5,These babies are no joke!!,"Man, these grippers are the real deal!Like the other reviewers, I had used many of the average store bought grippers. Those just don't cut it.The COC grippers define the word ""effective"". I got the Trainer, and managed to get myself up to 4-5 sets of 15 reps after about a month.My grip felt oh-so strong, and my forearms took on a noticeably more muscular look. No joke here; I have never really SEEN the effects of fitness training so fast. But, like me, if you use these grippers you will catch yourself looking at your forearms more and more with a smile on your face! Recently, I purchased No.1. It's gonna take a little longer to get that one mastered! (Don't ditch the Trainer!)Highly recommended!"
4,Great for people that work at a desk all day.,"I started a new job where I had to work at a desk all day and I noticed I was having problems with circulation. When I woke up, my arm/hand would be ""asleep"" and would take 3-4 minutes before I could even move it.I started using a store brand gripper and it was pretty good, by after I got to 50+ rep on it, I got bored. I purchased the Trainer(100lb) and I've noticed that I no longer have circulation problems and my hands & arms are noticably stronger.I'm now ready to move to No. 1 and can't wait to get it.The only criticism I have is the grip is not comfortable. I had to wet sand the metal grip, so it didn't hurt my hands when I used it. Also, it would be nice if they could curve the grip, so your pinky could fit around it easily.I Highly recommend this to anyone wanting to relieve stress or build hand/forearm strength.""Remember, Train, Don't Strain."""
3,"Nice resistance level, but the knurled handles hurt like hell","These are well made and have a serious, ""all business"" look and feel. My hands are by no means huge, yet I feel the two handles should be at least 1/4"" longer in the interest of providing a better overall fit.The knurled grip handles just flat out HURT. Applying this kind of compressive force on a knurled, small diameter bar WILL ALWAYS HURT! Why on earth don't they sell some nice, durable rubber sleeves to save their customer's hands?Also, don't kid yourself about your assumed strength. I've been lifting weights on a dedicated basis since the summer of '83, but have never owned a pair of these. At first I bought the 140 pound version and admittedly found them ""overly challenging."" I then bought the 100 pound version and they initially felt ""perfect."" It took me a month or so to work up to the 140s."
3,Go Straight to the #2,"I have the CoC grippers from sport through 1.5. I just recently purchased the 1.5 thinking it would be good to help transition to the #2. I think it was a mistake - I barely notice a difference between my 1s and 1.5s. If you can close the #1s for 10+ reps, I don't think you will find that the 1.5s are much more difficult. I will be picking up the #2s as soon as I can afford to."
5,PAGES OF HISTORY THAT COME ALIVE,"We all know the stories of Noah and his ark, Moses and The Ten Commandments and Abraham in the Promised Land. Now noted photographer Bruce Feiler takes us to the actual places where history was made. The photos --- intimate portraits, breathtaking vistas and fascinating panoramas --- are nothing less than astounding (and, in the case of the close-ups of the mummified Joseph, a bit shocking). From the heights of Mount Ararat (where Noah's ark landed) to the desert outpost in Turkey (where Abraham first heard the words of God) to the summit where Moses met His maker, Feiler puts a face on the stories that have long inspired the human spirit and kept man's faith alive. Thou shall not ignore this gem."
3,"Nice book, mediocre quality","I was excited about this book, and enjoyed the storytelling and images. However, I was expecting higher resolution photography. The type that really take you in and make you want to study them for a long time. The images in this book, while beautiful, have a grainy feel to them. I'm quite surprised that the authors were filming a series and didn't take a professional photographer with them."
2,Jeers to the way it describes Mt. Ararat,The author Feiler wrongly ignores (or honestly doesn't realize) that the Holy Bible claims mountains of Ararat to be where Noah's Ark landed. Not Mt. Ararat itself. In the early Christian era (long after the Old Testament was written down) Mt. Ararat was known instead as Masis Mons or Mt. Masis. The people of the early biblical writers's time all felt the Ararat region where the ark landed was far south of where Mt. Ararat is. There are many mountains that have traditions of being the mountain of Noah's Ark.Feiler also refers to WW1 Russian pilots spotting something resembling the ark on ararat. This story is rather fictional. It was pretty much created by one writer Benjamin Allen in 1940 for a magazine. Roscovitski was the name of the pilot that Allen invented to have seen the ark. Read books from your library by Prof. Lloyd Bailey on the real possible locations of Noah's Ark.
3,This book is not for christians perse,"I think this is an Ok book, but did not enjoy seeing Jesus being called a prophet. The picture quality was fair but that may have been the print quality. Altogether I regret having bought it.Herbert J. Everstijn"
4,You Go Girl!,"80's Diva. Sexy. Cool. Tattoed. Coupled with former Prince bass player Andre Cymone, they crank out some nasty grooves on this CD. Funky, funky, funky! ""Still A Thrill"" is organized chaos, with thumping velocity bass, reverse gated effects, and a heroin sheik style vocal track. ""Looking For A New Love"" became a theme song for many liberated minded ladies. Never failed to pack a dance floor at a club on lady's night. Of course my favorite is ""Don't you want me,"" an infectious dance mix that will help you get your groove back. Look, Jermaine Stewart wrote a song about this gal. She is on to something. Check her out. Meanwhile, live life! ;)"
4,A must buy for Jody Watley fans.,"This album is pretty good. It contains the smash dance hit single ""Don't You Want Me"". This was a very hard single to find on cd as the original album it came from contained an album version of this song. This album also contains her smash hits ""Some Kind Of Lover"" and ""Looking For A New Love""."
1,Was Never Impressed with Watley,"I never cared for Jody Watley's music and I can see why she was dropped by her record label back in the 90's. her songs are so lame and boring! nothing fresh, nothing original. she always came off to me that she was trying to be like Madonna, Paula Abdul and Taylor Dane and now she has this crappy new cd out called ""The Makeover"" in which she sings tired on songs Like are you ready for this Madonna's Borderline LOL. still trying to sound like Madonn! So pathetic! No wonder her career is down the Toilet!"
3,RAINMAKERS,Would not purchase another item from Newbury Comics did not arrive when promised July 21 sent a second via priority mail which wrrived in three days.The point I have a hard time in understanding is why three weeks for dilvery from the east coast to the midwest I could have drove there faster than that.Will be more alert when shopping with Amazon.com.
5,Quick response!,This was the 1st time I've ordered from MicksMuse and I was very impressed with the speed of the delivery. The quality of the used CD was excellent too; like new.I recommend them highly and will certainly use them again.
5,Long Gone Long,"This song is a story of a night a small town farm boy got out of High School and moved on to College or jobs or what ever. I to lived that night laying on the ground looking at the stars, drinking a few beers by the campfire with my friends, pondering what was going to happen with our lives. This song brings that night back like I was living it today.Great CD by an EVEN BETTER band, much like RUSH, these guys are Poets of society, and our interactions with one another.My Favorite CD of ALL TIME...."
4,southern fried rockers,"I saw these guys years ago (mid 80's) and was blown away by there performance.....they were opening for Berlin (""Take my Breath Away)....It was an odd pairing....but these guys stole the show...I wished there set wouldn't have ended.....The frontman was charismatic and theatrical, totally commanding your attention....the music was nothing like I had ever heard before.....feeling nostalgic and familiar yet new and exciting....I can't believe these guys are still somewhat underground...... I love these guys......It's very rootsy and unpolished by todays standards but that only adds to it's appeal.Some major issues are tackled in some of the songs but generally it's just a feel good album. Put it on when the sky is clear....the sun is shining.....and you're heading out on the road to anywhere.Major highlights include .... Downstream ...... government cheese.... and most powerfully "" information""...Give it a listen"
5,"Great customer service, nice product","We very much like the Kaloo doudous as gifts for new babies, and this is our second time ordering from Mini PomPom ([...]). They have fantastic customer service - quick shipping this time and last time was even faster -- they managed to deliver the same night when my daughter was in the hospital and lost hers. They totally went out of their way to help us out. So much appreciated. Will always try to order from them."
1,really wanted to like this radio,I've had this radio for about a week now and other than the cheesy plastic knobs it looks great and until today worked great. It just started to drift as others have observed. Sure glad I bought it from Amazon as it's going to have to go back as defective. I chose this one over the Sangean for looks and (perceived) quality. I made the wrong choice.
3,"Great design, but very poor radio reception","This is a well designed radio with excellent sound quality if you can connect your ipod. However, the FM radio reception is terrible. I can't even pick up local radio stations that comes in loud and strong in my car. When I do get a signal, the audio fades in and out when you walk around the room. For a type of technology as simple as a radio, I would think Tivoli would have mastered the antenna. Now I have to go out and buy one just to make this a worthwhile investment."
4,Tivoli Model One AM FM radio,"Contrary to what you might think looking at the photo, this radio has a beige front, not white. The photo is misleading, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Otherwise, a really great radio!!!!!"
3,not awed,after a little research i expected to have my socks knocked off by this radio. however i'm sure my expectations were way too high. it's ok. had to move it from where my cheapie set was just to get my station. then had to position just right. an antenna would help but it's a production to get 1. seems they don't sell them in stores anymore. i'm sure i'll get used to it.
5,Good reception and simple.,This radio has excellent reception but I couldn't recommend the sound quality as I am hearing impaired. My wife likes it and she has good hearing.
2,Looks nice but...,"The sound is too boomy. Plays loud and distortion free but the sound is unnaturally bottom heavy with phony bass. This radio would be vastly improved with the addition of tone controls. FM sensitivity is mediocre and AM reception is especially poor. The on/off and vol controls are too small and too smooth. The tuning knob is large and precise but there's nothing behind it. Overpriced at $100 , I hope I can get some of my money back selling it on eBay."
2,The tuner doesnt live up to the hype.,"I bought a Model One for my desk at work due to its compact size. A big plus was that it accepts external am and fm antennas. It has a clean sound, but the tuner doesnt live up to the hype. First, the tuner dial isn't accurate, and can't be calibrated. After three months my radio tuner developed static. I was annoyed enough that I sent it back to Tivoli at my expense, since my radio had a one year warranty. The radios are assembled in China, and the tuner is a sealed unit that cannot be serviced, or cleaned with tuner spray, like in the old days.///////////I asked about exchanging this unit for credit for one with a digital tuner, but Tivoli wouldn't work with me because I bought it through Amazon, not direct from Tivoli! They sent me a replacement radio, which appeared to be another customer return, The replacement radio also developed static after a couple months.//////////"
3,great radio with one big fault,"This is a solidly built radio with excellent sound for its small size. However, I am really disappointed that stations tend to drift. After tuning in a specific (FM) station, I find that I have to make minor adjustments to the tuning dial every 10 minutes or so to maintain best signal strength. This is not a radio where you can set it on one station and forget it. You have to make minor adjustments periodically to get best reception."
4,"solid, simple, great sound","I purchased this item because one of my brothers has one and I was impressed. I have read audiophile reviews of it in the past but it was the first time I heard it. Great sound, tuner is very good at isolating stations."
5,Awesome Radio. No Frills,"We use this radio in our kitchen to listen to talk radio. It works awesome! Sound quality, clarity & reception are all excellent. I love the way the knobs and dials feel! Excellent Quality. I have not heard the same thing about other models of this same brand; only about the Model one."
4,Love the Tivoli,"I recently purchased an ""iHome"" radio/clock/iPod player on the spur of the moment at a big box store. Big Mistake. The sound was terrible, tinny, with a low roar in the background. HATED IT. So I got online and did some research. My new Tivoli is great, with a clear and full sound. It has no clock (which I didn't want anyway). It's supposed to accomodate my iPod, which I haven't tried yet. The sound is SO much better I can't believe I'm still stuck with this iHome contraption (lost the receipt so can't return it).I like the smooth clean look of the Tivoli and it's very user friendly. I recommend this product as a good value for the price."
1,"Great at first, then slowly lost its ability to tune in a station","Bought this Tivoli radio in December, 2009, which at first worked and sounded great. However, over the past year it has become increasingly more difficult to tune it in to the local public radio station, to the point that we have given up. It is now an expensive door-stop. Read the reviews of this radio and you will see others reporting the same thing - a slow degradation of its tuner. There is obviously a design or build flaw. For as much as we spent on this radio it is very disappointing. Now we have a 20-year Sony old clock radio in its place on top of the refrigerator, which works just fine."
4,"Great radio, but pricey","After frustration with cheaper radios, I bought this flash-from-the-past: a well-crafted radio that does what it is supposed to do, i.e., tune in radio frequencies, and play them with decent fidelity. Why it costs so much to produce such a unit when the technology is so old, I'm not sure, but this radio works, and it works well, so I am, despite my empty wallet, happy."
3,Good radio,"This is a very good radio. But that is all it is: a good-sounding radio. It is not high-fidelity, it is not stereo, it is not something you can crank up for pulsating your hardwood floors.I bought this for my home office and am very pleased. For home office use, it is generally on low to moderate volume. It is much better sounding than the radio on a clock radio, but I have a boom box that I take on picnics that sounds better. Since my boom box doesn't fit into my home office decor, this one fit the bill nicely. It is nice to look at and very compact.I highly recommend this for office or den use where you are listening to NPR, big band, or easy listening stuff."
5,What a change!,"I've been listening to a good portable Sangean AM/FM/SW radio for years now. It's got great sound, and the option of two sound profiles - music and voice. But the reception is not the best and it doesn't look so great.The Tivoli, on the other hand, is a great kitchen-counter unit. It looks sharp in a clean, simple, retro kind of way and has easy to use controls. The reception is better than the digital radio it's supplanting in that location, and there's no telescoping antenna to get in the way anymore. The sound is different, too - very full and rich due the the resonating chamber inside the wooden cabinet. I would like to have the option of changing audio profiles at the flick of a switch - I listen almost exclusively to FM talk radio and sometimes the deeper bass that sounds good when listening to music doesn't sound so great with talk. But the Tivoli reportedly has less bass than a comparable model - the Sangean WR-1."
3,Good sound...okay tuning.,"Very good sound from a box this size, very nice stereo headphone output. The tuning started great but degrades quickly, just like any cheap transistor radio. 4 years in and I can barely tune anything in. Stations had wandered across the dial and all compressed in. Had to open it up and adjust the capacitor, blow some compressed air in there...that helped somewhat. They need to go digital with the tuner and the product will be a lot better. Granted I wouldn't have this problem if it weren't that the only 4 quality stations are all within 3 Hz of each other all the way over at the thinking man's end of the dial."
5,Great Reception !!!,"Purchased this radio for a bathroom that has a reception problem and had worn out many cheaper models..plugged this one in and it worked like a charm from the beginning...this may cost a bit more than other models, but it is more than worth it....can't figure out why I waited so long to purchase it!! Great Investment..."
2,On/Off/Freq Switch Fails,"I like this table radio for all the reasons others have cited, but it has a fatal flaw. The On/Off/Freq switch has failed after about a year on three of the four units I have owned or given as gifts (two Tivoli iPal radios and two Tivoli Model twos--I assume they all use the same switch). Tivoli replaced them out of warranty for $75."
3,Just what I wanted!,The Tivoli Model One AM/FM radio is just what I've been looking for. I love the compact size and the reception and sound quality is excellent. I'm a happy shopper!
3,Tivoli One not so hot on FM,"Just a comment on Tivoli One's FM sensitivity. I've got about15 tabletop radios, and have hooked them, one by one, to anoutdoor Yagi antenna.I think I just got a bad one, but the Tivoli had by far the worstfm sensitivity of all 15. Stations that I get wonderfully on my WR-2 orDuo were very weak on the Tivoli.I remember the original radios of this type, and always wanted one.Pity that this one did so poorly.For example, I like to listen to a station 70 miles away. My other radiosget it fine, but the Tivoli almost couldn't hear it.I finally gave it to a Lady I know who uses it for a kitchen radio.By far the best radio I've had is a Boston Acoustics, with a CD player built in.But the Tivoli is just not for DXers.Jerry ODell"
4,Nice Radio,I use this unit with my iPod and the audio quality is quite good for a unit of this size. The sound may be a bit boomy for some users with accentuation of frequencies in the 150 - 250 Hz range. The case is very nice and the reduction gear on the tuning knob makes it easy to locate hard to tune stations. I found the volume knob to be a bit too linear and awfully sensitive. Overall my biggest complaint would be the yellow tune light. When using the unit at night with my ipod I found the yellow glow to be a bit annoying on my night stand.
2,Great sound - Tuner drifts constantly,"I bought two of these units about a year ago. The audio is amazing for for the small size, it can really fill up the room. I have not tested the AM tuning, but the FM tuner constantly drifts. Every 30 to 40 min you start to hear a bit of distortion in the station. You have to go and bump the frequency up a bit then all is well again. When it does tune into a station the sound is wonderful (for another 30 min). I can tune both of these units along with a digital pll receiver on my stereo to the same station, leave the house for 2 hours and both Tivoli's have drifted far enough off the signal that you cannot tell what is playing on the radio from all the distortion, the digital receiver is still locked in and playing perfectly.For sound for pound, I give this unit 5 stars. However, the tuner section gets a solid 1. Since this is an AM/FM radio I would think the tuner is important enough to the function to justify a 2 star rating."
1,Bad Customer Service!,"I wouldn't ever buy a Tivoli product just because of their bad customer service.No, I don't own this model I owned the Tivoli Pal but based on my experience I'm offering my advice to stay away from Tivoli.I registered my new Tivoli Pal and I had to install two new batteries at almost $24.00 each and then it died completely after only eight months.Tivoli customer service refused to honor my registration as proof of purchase, does anyone ever keep a receipt?They wanted to charge me another $50,00 to repair it."
1,Not A Bose!,"I purchased this radio based on previous owners reviews. But I do not agree with them. This is no Bose-like sound quality. Yes it is a lot cheaper, but I am not satisfied with so much less in sound quality."
2,very over rated,"I just bought one. Its very small with limited volume level. The FM tuner is very average, certainly not superior as the ads would suggest. Its very expensive. Im quite disappointed with this product."
2,too much base,I liked the sound but I returned it because it had so much base that women's voices were hard to understand
2,Half baked,"I've had this radio for a year. Good retro looking, good sound. But all those people who call it's reception excellent must be on something. The FM reception is only OK, and the AM is just not working. It's not whether the signal is strong or weak - it doesn't matter. The engineering of this part of Model One is thoroughly screwed."
2,Very disappointing,"Whatever you may have heard, this Tivoli product is NOT the Apple of radios. I in fact didn't even take the wrapper off so I cannot comment anything about functionality or radio performance. I paid $150 because I expected a very high end product with nice wood and a classy appearance. The wood looks like cheap pine (mine was maple/hunter) and the overall look is idential to a child's toy that they would get for a gift. I returned it same day. If you're expecting something special you need to look elsewhere, this is a rip off."
2,What's all the hoopla about?,"I'd heard many positive reviews for these radios, and figured that plus the astronomical price must mean it's got something going for it. Wrong. Other than the heavy wood cabinet, this is a run of the mill table radio. The reception is no better than any other radio, including the FM tuner in my cell phone - even with an external antenna. The sound is OK but nothing to rave about. I've had 30 year old Sony table radios that sounded just as good or better. A close look at the componentry reveals this is the same electronic junk that has flooded this country since the American manufacturers threw in the towel. This is a classic case of the placebo effect - it looks cool, and the box raves about it's superiority, so everyone just jumps on the bandwagon."
2,Good Reception? Really?,All my aunt wanted for her 80th birthday was a radio that got good reception of WBZ AM radio in Boston. She only lives one city away but her not so expensive radio was loosing signal. I was going to spare no expense for this wonderful woman. I was about to get the Bose Wave radio but read all the reviews and it seemed people were raving about the reception of this one. I was so proud of myself and bragging to the rest of the family of what I got. When I set it up I was horrified to see that the cheap radio she had got better reception than this one. I finally got WBZ but I had to move this radio to the corner of the room to get it. Is it me? I don't think so.
4,"Looks Great, Sounds Fantastic, but Needs a Better Tuner","I got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it. The unit is beautifully designed, fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small. My only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong. I live in a tough area for reception, and there's slight static on my favorite stations. The FM antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit, but the reception is still not totally clear.That being said, I'm glad I got it, and when my wife's happy, I'm happy."
2,"Too much bass boost, not enough treble.","I bought two when they first came out because I am a retired KLH dealer and assumed that if it was designed by Henry Kloss they would be great. I listen mainly to NPR talk radio and find that speech is harder to understand than on my two really old KLH radios or even my 35 year old Tandberg portable. Usually a resistor or capacitor removal would help, but Tivoli will not give out a schematic. Now that my warranty is up, I will take them apart and try to improve the speech sound. Music sound is better, but still boomy."
5,"miraculous, audiophile wonder","the Model one is the most amazing table radio available on the market today. What makes it superior to other table radios? the build quality is superb, with real wood, retro good looks and a simple layout that will appeal to all. You'd think it was built in Switzerland or Germany. The sound is delighful, with a tube like warmth that will be appreciated by audiophile and audio rookie alike. To whit: I had some friends over for dinner one night and was playing jazz/salsa from a local NPR affiliate. During the middle of dinner, one of my friends, a student at the Curtis Institute, asked ""is your RADIO putting out that amazing sound""? nuff said. I just bought Tivoli's new music system and give the radio out as christmas/bday gifts. You'll be glad you stepped up!"
5,Fabulous and Simple,We love the Tivoli radios for their beauty and quality. The Tivoli Pal radio is so amazing and convenient.It is amazing how different prices for the same item are on Amazon! Weird!
4,Tivoli AM/FM Table Radio,"I bought the radio for my wife who works in a large officebuilding. She was looking for a radio that would give her clear, static free music, and resonable sound quality. The Tivoli AM/FM radio has met both criteria and she is very please."
4,lacking just a little...,"I like the sound the radio produces very much. I only use it to listen to the Red Sox. I find 2 things a little disappointing. Although the tuning dial has a ratio that gives you some extra turning to tune in the right spot, the exact station location is easy to tune past (for the broadcast I am looking for) and the little yellow light doesn't have much leeway with respect to brightness. The antenna must be positioned just so for any of this to happen. I do not know whether an FM antenna would fix this or not. The good antennas are not cheap and I was trying to keep my investment to the price of the unit."
3,Please note the hiss before you lay down the cash!,"I needed a little radio/music just by my bedside.The Model One is well reviewed, and has great styling. I bought the product and was aghast that when turning it on at only slight volume, there is a really annoying hiss that you can hear at night. And over-priced!You may not notice it in a loud shop, but take care to look for it!I got my cash back from the local retailer and bought a Sangean WR-2 and it is amazing!"
1,Tivoli M1CLA,"Well built but the AM ""Hum"" is overwhelming.I am very disappointed that a $100 radio has such lousy AM. It's not like AM radio design is something new!!!For a company that prides itself on sound quality, I'd be embarrassed to deliver such a product.It's For Sale."
1,"Terrible, terrible quality","i bought the whole package: radio, CD player, and external speaker.AM reception - even a 50,000 watt local station - is too weak to use.The knob for switching between AM/FM/CD is going out.The CD player has gone out.I have had no problems with the external speaker."
1,Absolute junk Tivoli will not stand behind warranty,Radio stopped working after 3 months -no response from Trivoli after numerous phone calls and e-mails. When I finally did get a hold of them they said the repair would be minimum of $100.00 without even knowing the problem.This radio is less than 6 months old.Tivoli Model Satellite Table Radio (Sirius Satellite Radio / AM / FM )
2,Ponderous sound in a pretty box,"Four stars for the retro styling, and for the overall fit and finish; zero stars for the sound quality. Even played at low volume, the radio has a chesty, muddy sound whose ponderous mid-bass poisons the midrange and high frequencies. This problem can be improved slightly by plugging the bass-reflex port on the bottom, but still, a chesty and unenjoyable sound that makes all kinds of music sound ugly. I cannot believe Henry Kloss would have approved of this abominable sound, let alone have engineered it. Rats."
5,Like My Old KLH,"In the mid-60's I bought a little KLH component tuner that looks exactly like the Tivoli Audio One I recently purchased. I loved that little tuner, but it became a dinosaur when receivers came with radios built in. My new Tivoli replaces that little KLH and stands on its own. I bought the radio primarily to listen to NPR in my kitchen, so I don't need stereo. The sound quality is clear and crisp. Some reviewers complained of a hiss, but I don't find that. Of course I love the retro look of the radio and remembrance of days of yore. The style is simple, yet effective. I was lucky to find this model on a deep clearance at Target and bought it for less than half the going price. A great radio for a great price. I look forward to years of enjoyment from it."
2,"Nice Sound, AM is bad","I have the Tivoli PAL and Songbook. Those are great. The PAL battery is not too hot, but the sound is great. So I bought the Tivoli Model One radio. One for my inlaws and one for me. The AM reception stinks. The PAL AM is fine. Not the Model One radio. Would not work well in our kitchen. Any other radio was fine. I emailed Tivoli and they recommended the AM antenna. No luck. That did not help. I live in the Seattle area, not ""way out there"". So I gave mine away (along with the AM antenna) as it was too annoying. I felt better knowing somebody else may like having it. Looks nice.:)Oh, the Model One FM was OK, but not as good as the PAL. My father in law uses his occasionally. I should have bought him the Songbook or the Sangean PR-D5P Portable Radio (real happy with that and it has RDS). I would get that instead of a Tivoli next time. But the PAL is slick, but those batteries just don't last. :) I had thought the Model One would be as good as the PAL. Oh well."
2,No FM reception at all after about a year,"After about a year, my radio started periodically making loud interference-type noises. Spent quite some time trying to figure out what device might be interfering. No luck. Now it has no FM reception at all. It plays AM on both settings. Shame that it has only a 1-yr warranty."
5,Get the updated version of Model One if you can!,The new updated Tivoli Model One adds AUX option to selector knob so you need not disconnect your ipod or other device before listening to AM/FM radio. The price is identical and it is not clear if Amazon is selling the older or newer model. (The photo shows the older model)
2,Very disappointed,After reading all of the reviews about this radio I was very excited to buy it for my husband's 65th birthday. We have a cheap little radio in our bathroom and the reception is not all that great. I researched to help me find what I thought would be the best possible radio for reception.He was delighted with the gift and it is beautiful. But when we went to plug it in the bathroom the reception was terrible! Our little cheap radio was far superior to this one. Consequently I sent it back and now I have nothing to show for his birthday...
1,The tuner doesn't last very long,"I, too, wanted to love this thing. The problem I've had is that the tuner goes bad --And I see that others have had the same problem. I suspect that a lot of the positive reviews were written when the unit was relatively new. I'm on my second unit after returning the first one, and now my second radio is starting to go. The tuner get's real scratchy and imprecise and the unit emits an obnoxious crackle while tuning... and it jumps on and off of the station. The tuner is probably a poor design, and just isn't durable enough. It sounds pretty good out of the box, though. And it's got a nice look to it sitting on the counter."
4,Kloss Tivoli Radio is perfect...,"for a bedroom or kitchen, where good reception and sound are more important than overall volume. This little elegant radio delivers its value and more."
1,"Drifting and drifting, tubby tone","I would give the Model One zero stars is I could. I'm sure this was once a fine model, designed long ago by the justly famous Henry Kloss. Whatever has been done to it, Mr. Kloss must be turning in his grave.The good: This is a fine-looking radio.The bad: 1. It can't hold a station. 2. It can't reject adjacent stations (which are plentiful in urban areas), so re-tuning requires an almost endless back-and-forth turning of the tuning dial. 3. As many have noted, mid-bass is over-emphasized, creating an unpleasantly ""tubby"" sound. Male voices sound like they're coming from the bottom of an oil drum. 4. There's no tone control to fix #3, so I had to stuff paper towels into the speaker vent to make the sound less noxious. Ugh!"
1,Very Disappointed,"Based on the rave reviews in Amazon,I bought this unit to reach some weak signal stations.It absolutely did not perform even with the attached aerial.In fact,I feel ripped-off by the reviews and would never again purchase an item based on so-called customer reviews.Tivoli Audio Model One M1CLA AM / FM Table Radio, Classic / Walnut"
2,FM channel drift,"Fine sound when you get it. The tuner is a weak point, the main symptom being FM channel drift. It either has poor phase-loop locking or some other flaw. Can't recommend this."
2,I Found the Sound to be Muffled,This radio really needs a tone control. The sound is quite muffled. Also turning the tuning dial from a station at the lower end to one at the higher end is a chore. The dial is quite stiff.
2,Good looks. Horrible audio,"The audio quality of this radio is really poor. Yes, I know it only has one speaker, but I'm not talking about lack of stereo. The tonal quality is so bad I can barely stand to listen to it. I only give it a 2nd star for a pleasing appearance."
5,Incredible Sound,"This radio produces absolutely incredible sound with a very, very small footprint. Ideal for office or kitchen. Buying my second one now."
1,Looks aren't everything,"This is a good looking radio, BUT, I have a huge problem with the FM reception. The only time I get good FM reception is on a cloudy day. I'm in Arizona, so that doesn't help. No where does it tell you how to find an FM antenna for this radio that does the job. My old timey boom box does a better job than this without the antenna. Why do they try to market this for visually impaired?"
3,"Nice sound from small package, but ...","This radio has a nice rich sound for the size and having only one speaker.The quality of construction seems well done.My only gripe would be that the reception is pretty weak and I would suspect that is why the tuner knob was designed the way it is to allow fine tuning in an attempt to get a decent reception.The wire antenna does help but having a wire strung up a wall not only looks displeasing, it doesn't do a very good job of doing what it's suppose to do. It's been my experience that anytime a radio/stereo comes with a wire antenna, you can expect poor reception.I would rather it come with a telescoping antenna like the one on the iPAL which I suspect has better reception.For the price paid, I'm disappointed but will be keeping it.I'll be looking for a 3rd party antenna that might help bring in better reception that isn't bulky, obtrusive or require having a wire strung up my wall."
3,one major defect,"I bought the Tivoli radio for my bathroom and is sounded fine but after a while it developed a loud rumble when tuning stations. Their customer service suggested I turn the tuning knob back and forth several times. That helpedonly for a few minutes. I returned the radio to Tivoli and they sent a new one (after several weeks.) This one developed the same problem after a week or two. I agree that its sound is fine and it is sensitive enough to pick up most stations. But, I can't help wondering if there is a defect in the design of the tuning mechanism. I also have a competitor's table radio. It is not as sensitive but it does sound fine and has tone controls. If you listen to onlyone station, then you don't have to tune it and won't notice this defect."
1,Such A Pity...,"That a fine-sounding radio is built with such low-grade, non-audio parts. Don't get me wrong the exterior is very attractive in a cool retro way and I've never had such rich sound from a small table radio. The timbre of the sound is incredibly life-like. However, the mechanical switches and intervening connections are incredibly cheap and poorly constructed. The volume will suddenly go to zero only to be fully restored by the slightest tap on the volume control. Turning the radio on and off often results in a loud pop through the speakers, even if it's kept unplugged between uses. It's not just one bad radio, either. Before the first one began failing, I purchased 3 of these over the course of a year from 3 different vendors. They all have the same flaws."
4,Nearly Perfect Table Radio - Just One Small Flaw,"The Pros: Great sound, small, retro-looking, easy tuning, easy on the ears and eyes, back panel connectors so you can patch in your iPod or CD player, use with headphones, even has a record-out if you want a nice clean mono signal to record, accepts either 117V AC house current with supplied cord, or can be powered by 12 VDC. Sounds good with everything from jazz, classical, rock, country and voice.The One Small Flaw? The volume control isn't consistent at lower volume levels. If you're trying play this really softly, it's hard to adjust between very very low volume and slighly louder very low volume.(Note: I own the black/silver version, but didn't see it listed elsewhere.)"
2,Planned obsolescence?,"We enjoyed our Model One for nearly two years, and then it died. Though we treated it well, after just 22 months the unit's signal would drop to inaudibility within minutes of turning it on. I wrote to Tivoli to see if they would fix or replace it. Didn't get a word in response. A radio is not a terribly complicated device. I've had radios 30 and 40 years old that still worked fine. Was the Tivoli designed to break down in so short a time? I couldn't say. Maybe mine was simply a lemon. Still, I would have expected that Tivoli would take pride enough in their reputation that they'd make things right. I won't make the mistake of buying another of their products."
2,Tubby bass.,"A long-time fan of Henry Kloss and KLH, I jumped to buy the Tivoli Model One. Love the look, size and obvious Kloss build quality. But, it needs at least a bass control if not also a treble control. At first I was impressed with the amount of bass this little radio produces. But, as time passed, the boomy, tubby bass began to annoy.I also have the Model 88 by Henry Kloss that has a subwoofer control. That is the only near-perfect radio of many I have tried and owned. Unfortunately, I cannot put it where I have the Tivoli, a cramped corner of my wash stand.With its retro styling, the Model One is visually appealing, but with regret I can't rate this a good listening radio."
1,watch out for the hum/buzz,"The radio had a hum/buzz that was quiet but distracting. For a product that purports to have such fine sound, it was unacceptable. In fact, other than an ungrounded phonograph player, I've never had any product, no matter how inexpensive, with this problem. Another reviewer (whose review can be found under the white on white version of the product) said that the problem, which is apparently not unique to my unit, can be solved by purchasing a filtered direct current power supply to use instead of the internal power supply, but this thing should work properly right out of the box - it's supposed to be simple, right? Also, the faceplate was glued on a bit askew. All in all, very disappointing, and I am returning mine."
3,Meant to Review the Model Three,"Sorry folks, I meant to review the Model Three that I own and I put it in the wrong spot. but if the One is anything like the Three.........."
4,"Nice radio, however overpriced","For some reason, Tivoli radios have skyrocketed in price with no changes to the products (40 - 60% increases in 2008). Anyway, once you get passed the price, the radio is actually pretty nice. As advertised, it projects a pleasent full sound from an attractive package. As others have stated, the tuner is very good, and the knobs are smooth and accurate. It also has an auxillary jack for your ipod. There's really not much more to it. Simple.If you like the look, and can deal with the price, you could do a lot worse than this little mono. Four years after my purchase I'm still excited everytime I turn it on. While not my go to audio system for a party, it's perfect for a kitchen, den, or office. Looks great on a bookself.I'm now considering the Model Two for my basement, however the price increase irks me to no end... Might just have to give Cambridge Soundworks a try..."
5,Great radio,"Great sound, simple to use and can plug all kinds of audio into it. Amazing sound for the size and price and can fit anywhere. Makes a great gift."
5,This is a great radio,"I got this for a friend who wanted a good radio for the kitchen. I was skeptical of this thing, since it seemed a bit too small for good sound, but I changed my mind when we opened the box and plugged it in.I have nothing negative to say about it. The design is simple and classy. It just looks good. Even better, it sounds great. It's easy to tune as well. I was listening to some Bach a few days ago, and I was really struck at how clear and clean the sound was. It almost sounded like there was a piano in the room. I don't know how they did it in such a small package, but the bass response is clear without being boomy or muddy at all.This is a product that works exceptionally well."
2,Take complaints seriously,"After some 25 years the old stereo radio finally began to give up its ghost. What to buy next? We listen to 3 or 4 FM stations only. Liking Mr. Kloss's design and not paying sufficient attention to complaints in other reviews resulted in a purchase a few weeks ago, a step I now thoroughly regret. The FM station we listen to most is only 12 miles away. We are regularly annoyed by the drift of the tuner that requires constant adjustment. In addition, the sound at regular levels is poor. Ready to chuck the piece. So much for Henry Kloss. Buyers beware."
1,FM Reception unacceptable,"I don't understand all the hype about Tivoli radios. I have a model 1 and a PAL, and both of them have terrible FM reception. The model one in my office is next to the window. I am 3 blocks from our local NPR station, with uninterrupted signal path. I cannot tune into the station for more than 30 seconds before the static becomes unbearable. This is also the case with my PAL. If you can lock into a station, these radios have pretty good sound for such a small package. The retro look is very appealing, and I bought them for the simplicity in their design and based on the reviews. However, the knobs on the model one are very cheap plastic-y and as stated above, the FM reception is deplorable. These radios in my opinion are overpriced junk.I will continue my search for a decent sounding tabletop radio - but it will not include anything by Tivoli."
5,Best Radio,"I have one of these in my home, and my boyfriend is always listening to it, so I bought it as a gift for him, for his house. He loves it. Receoption and clarity of sound is excellent for fm stations."
5,"To the point,informative,and accurate","I found the information to be very enlightening,and a good source for the novice.After investigating several farms,and using this guide,I found myself able to look at a possible purchase with a much more informed point of view."
5,Great!,"I bought this as a cassette tape almost 20 years ago and couldn't believe my good luck that I found it in CD form. If you like to listen to thunder storms and rain as much as I do, BUY THIS. It has cello music in the background but it doesn't detract from the natural sounds. I listen to it nearly every night to sleep or whenever I'm stressed out - it's awesome."
2,2.5 stars.,"** In the Lord of the Rings, Eowyn fears above all else to be caged and useless. Her fear seems to be an apt description of the life that Elizabeth Cockey's patients, people trapped in various states of dementia, face. Yet, for an hour a week, with the help of a dedicated art therapist, they are set free from the walls of their mind, and in their freedom, the one helping them finds the meaning of her life. More than one message might be found here. In helping others, you become the best you that is possible to be. As long as someone is alive, there is hope for them to have purpose. Just a little bit of light is enough to turn back the darkness. Perhaps, if you are facing such a twilight time with a loved one, you can find some comfort if you read this book. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."
3,comentarios sobre el formato,"El contenido muy bueno, el formato regular. Es demasiado grande para resultar cómodo de leer y las cubiertas son demasiado endebles. Sin embargo esta tradución es digna, hay una edición unos años posterior cuya traducción es pésima ¡no la adquieran!"
3,"Bueno, pero fundamentalmente enfocado al trabajo con grupos.","Si practicas en solitario o quieres utilizar elementos sin seguir estrictamente rituales más religiosos que prácticos este libro no te resultara especialmente util. No obstante aquello, el libro es excelente para iniciar un grupo o enriquecer la práctica de uno ya formado en terminos de agregar formalidad y riqueza a los rituales y practicas en general."
1,toshiba sd-5000 player not any good,I have had lots of issues with this player. it will not play half of the discs that I watch even store bought dvds I would not recomend this player to anyone because it is nothing but problems. I have the toshiba sd-6100 but it does work good but better improved than the sd-5000 player
1,Toshiba = Junk,"I purchased this expensive player, and it stopped working after a year. During that time, it refused to play a large number of disks. Thankfully, I had an Xbox that could play DVD's fine.Also, Toshiba customer service is abysmal. When you have a problem outside of warranty, they offer to sell you the same product again, or the newer model, at almost retail pricing. Avoid Toshiba products like the plague."
2,Very poor DVD player,"I bought this DVD player to pair with my Toshiba 42RV530U (Which I love). It is a sleek, sexy looking DVD player. That concludes anything positive in this review. The player frequently pauses during playback, creates distortion or stuttering the picture, and occasionally freezes and will not respond at all! The only option is to reboot the player, which is very frustrating when in the middle of a film. It's caused me much embarrassment when watching movies with friends. I wondered if the problem was with me using older, possibly scratched disks. That ended when I put in a brand new copy of Kill Bill and experienced the same issues. I also wondered if it was a heat issue, and so I put the player by itself with longer cables to give it plenty of room to breath. The player still crashed during playback. Frankly, this is the worst piece of consumer electronics I've ever had the misfortune to purchase. If it wasn't too late, I would return it.Stay away from this DVD player!"
1,Toshiba SD 5000 Located at the Local Landfill,"This product freezes on every DVD I try to play on it. Usually, not until late in the DVD when things are getting interesting. You cannot fast forward or do anything to get around this problem. I tried to contact Toshiba Customer support during the warranty period without any luck. Then I realized life is too short for this and that trash pickup was on Thursday so off it went to the landfill. This is the last Toshiba product I will ever buy."
2,Broke after a few months,"I bought this dvd player a few months ago. It wasn't fancy but it upconverted relatively well. However, it stopped playing discs and I probably watched less than 10 movies on it. Too bad the warranty is only 3 months. Based on my experience as well as some other reviews, I'd suggest staying away and paying a little more for a better dvd player."
2,Too many problems,"This unit has a number of drawbacks that are deal breakers for me. Firtsly, the manual is not available on the Toshiba web site (even though most other Toshiba DVD manuals are posted there). Secondly, the system does not use discrete IR remote codes for on and off which makes it difficult to use with my Harmony remote. Lastly, if you stop a DVD it will not start where it left off (my $35 cheapo DVD does)."
1,Avoid like the plague,"I had the 4990, which is the same model as this one, only in the multi-region format. I bought it last November and two weeks ago, the drawer refused to open. I brought it to a repair place, only to find that it required a new belt and motor, making it not worth repairing, considering the price. During it's year life, I also had the same issues with it that others here have described -- it doesn't hold its place, it freezes occasionally, etc. The picture did look great on my 42"" plasma but ultimately it's just a piece of junk. Avoid."
3,"Acceptable player, decent value","I bought this from Circuit City without any research, so I was kicking myself after I read the negative reviews here. Fact is, yes, the player skips a little, but it was not so annoying. I've played half a dozen movies. One I think didn't skip at all, the others skipped maybe twice during playback, for a short time. Mind you, I was really looking for it, so after a while the short skip may not be noticeable at all. The PQ is pretty good. I decided to trade it in for the highly rated Sony NS75H last week. Frankly, not much difference in PQ. So, I won't say I recommend this unit, but if you want to get a unit for $70 then this is not bad."
1,Not worth buying,"This product never worked. I sent it back to Toshiba and received a new one. The new one worked for less than 48 hours. I had bought this because it had been highly rated by Consumer Reports. This now makes me question the research of Consumer Reports. It seems I cannot write a review without giving this product a rating, so I gave it a single star. I really did not want to give it any star."
4,great deal,i bought this for seventy dollars at CC.44.97 plus free shipping. grab it.just be careful with the tray.you can always return it if defective.
1,Want frustration? Get this DVD player.,"Works fine.... until it starts freezing. If there's a rare chance that you're one of those people who only watches movies up the tracks 12 to 15, you're in good shape, because the DVD player starts freezing around there. Overall, it's a piece of crap. Sorry, Toshiba, you really bit the dust with this one."
1,stopped working after a month,"Good picture quality, good sound, worked great... after a month, poof, it stopped working. Any dvd I'd put in the player would not read and the player was stuck on ""load"". Nothing I did to try to remedy it worked. The repair shop's fix would cost more than what I paid for this piece of crap machine. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Toshiba SD-5000 1080i Upconverting DVD Player,"Upsampling is so-so. In fact, I prefer my progressive Sony DVP-S900ES video quality over this very reasonable player. My display is a new Samsung 50 inch plasma display."
2,Surprisingly Poor,"I tried this model out with my Sony HDTV using the HDMI connection. Watched a recent movie with quite a few dark scenes and was surprised at how bad the picture was. It almost looked like a cartoon. At one point the playback slowed, became very blocky and froze! It was so bad I had to stop the movie and try the disk in our Sony Playstation 2. The picture from the PS2 showing the same scenes was fantastic and it doesn't do up-conversion of course. On the positive side the Dolby and DTS sound from the Toshiba was great. I returned the Toshiba and purchased the Sony DVPNS75H and now am very pleased. The picture quality on the Sony is far superior - much brighter and sharper."
4,Great upconverted picture,"I formerly owned the SD-6980, but the device failed while under warranty. I liked that device a lot, especially its card reader port. I received a new SD-5000 from Toshiba to replace the obsolete SD-6980. The DVDs upconverted to 1080i really look like the images I receive from HD cable. The SD-6980 did a good job too, but you could see grainy areas or images that weren't perfect. I love the SD-5000 . The downsides I found from this device are no Optical port for audio, and of course no card reader. I used coax for my surround sound and its fine. The quality of the picture easily outweighs the cons.In dark scenes though, the blacks tend to pixelate...likely and upconversion issue. Also the player has an issue where it may lock up for 5-8 seconds during playback. Its annoying, but you can live with it."
1,cheap but you get what you paid for,"I found that it skips here and there. It also freezes here and there.It can be very annoying..If I knew about this quality of dvd player, I should have bought phillips for $40 instead of this $80 sd-5000 toshiba.HDMI resolution option is there but it didn't really make a lot of difference in pic quality between the 3 settings. I cannot even tell if the option is really working.Well, I couldn't bear the frequence of these instances, so I ended up returning. The return shipping was free."
3,"Good picture, lacks features, feels cheap","Picture quality at 1080i is good. However, there aren't many other pros. It won't resume a disc where you stopped, it has no time display on the front, plastic case feels cheap, no forward/back buttons on the main unit, and worst of all, every disc we've watched pauses for about 3-5 seconds. It must be the layer change, but I've never seen one that long. I think I'm going with the Sony NS75H, given it's stellar reviews. Too bad it doesn't come in black. Maybe I'll spray paint it. lol"
1,weirdly sucky,The drawer doesn't do what the remote tells it to do -- it'll say it's loading when it won't retract the drawer then it'll complain that the dvd can't be read. Or else it'll retract the drawer then open it immediately on its own. Once you cajole it into ingesting and reading the disk it seems to work fine. How do I get my money back?
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this player to play dvd's through my new widescreen 720p/1080i hdtv. Image looks okay, the difference between the three settings (480p, 720p, 1080i) are not that noticable. The real problem with this player is that it skips...a lot. The skipping is really frustrating. The other day I put in a brand new simpsons dvd and it skipped so bad it froze up and wouldn't accept discs for about an hour. I finally got fed up and returned it to the store. I have since bought a samsung upconverting dvd player and am much happier."
1,Avoid!,"This DVD player produces great picture quality, but has two fatal defects. With most DVDs, it will randomly pause for a few seconds, and sometimes freeze completely. It is also very slow to respond to the remote. Do not buy this piece of junk."
3,Soft picture,"Compared to Philips 5982, the picture of this player when sent to a 100"" projection screen is way too soft. Upconversion doesn't seem to change anything, and sharpness (that can be adjusted via remote) only brings out compression artifacts. Besides, the adjustments are lost after you power cycle the player.It doesn't remember play position, can't resume DVD after you take it out and put it back in.On the positive side, it didn't freeze a lot on me. Only once. And didn't have problems playing those disks that Philips was continuously choking on."
1,Died After 3 Months,"So much for a ""bargain."" The player now will accept no disks at all. I would be surprised if more than 30 disks were every played. And there's no support of even mention of this model on the Toshiba website. How hard can it be to make a dependable player?!?!?"
1,Old news!,"This has been rewritten it appears with a few new covers for a half century. The basic premise of the book's teachings would apply to someone coming from another planet and states that yes, in theory, you can do this. If you slowly go into real estate and work it, by the time you retire you should have made a bit of money. It reads like a turn of the century boring book."
2,Alarming folktale,"One day when their mother was in town at the market, her 7 children are tricked by a witch, and she turns them into various items of food. The mother returns just as the witch is about to eat the children. The mother must solve a riddle proving she knows and recognizes each of her children in order to restore them to their former shape.The illustrations by Don Wood remind me of Maxfield Parrish prints. They are awesomely grotesque and could be frightening to children."
3,Not for little kids!!,"I bought this book for my 4-yr-old friend, but returned it because the subject matter is not appropriate for her. My primary issue with Heckedy Peg is the witch telling the mother to cut off her feet before she can enter the cottage. Although the mother only pretended to cut off her feet, I found the idea disturbing. This is very much in the vein of Grimm's fairy tales, which are quite grim. Some children & parents would not be disturbed by it, but it is not a story for sensitive kids.The illustrations are incredible! It is a beautiful book and the story conveys the important message of stranger danger. However, it is violent & some kids will find it scary."
4,good but upsetting to me later in life,"I read this book as a child and liked it a lot; I still think it's an entertaining story with beautiful pictures. However, it is one of many stories about a witch, in this case a devalued version of the ancient Greek goddess Hecate. This just saddens me a bit because children tend to be exposed to few stories about positive interpretations of ancient goddesses from the before-Christ era, so I recommend that parents look into providing a more balanced repertoire."
1,never got my order!!,Never recieved my order and the seller would never get back with me!!!!!!!! Do not buy from this guy!!!!!!!!!1
3,Heckedy Peg,"Our whole family enjoys this book. Audrey Wood is one of our favorite authors. All of her books are a delight to read. I meant to select 5 stars, and I can't change it now!"
5,Heckedy Peg,"This is one of the best books ever!! I took it to a baby shower, as we each needed to bring a book. This was one of my children's favorites!"
5,Best for the price,"Very clear,and can focus as close as 7. Equal to binoculars that cost much more. Light and easy to use."
4,Nice brush,"I like the quality of this brush. It is shaped differently than the generic brand one I had that fell apart, so it's taking me a little while to get used to, but it's a very sturdy brush. The handle is just a tad long but it is so much better in quality than any other retail store-bought brushes. I expect it will last much longer!"
4,Rock the boat!,"Ok, first of all this thing inflates and sencond, it's A BOAT! What's not to love here? I love it because I'm on a boat with my flippie-floppies! Rock'n the boat is easy cause this boat rocks! It came with some sweet oars and it makes for a smooth ride into the seacaves of the Channel Islands. Awesome accessories that I paired with the Sevylor Inflatable Boat include tying the inflatable floating cooler to the back and using the inflatable pink flamingo as a sweet hood ornament. Passing kayakers will be totally jealous of your ride because you can chill out with a modelo and kick back in all the room you got in your boat! Also the hand pump makes for a great way to fan the campfire coals when you are roasting dogs! I give it 4 stars only because it makes for an uncomfortable bed at night."
1,Beware boat it too small for even one adult,This boat is good for kids only. Don't buy if you are an adult. Consider buying a four person boat instead. For some reason the advertised capacity of the boats are not accurate. For practical purpose a six person boat is good for three persons only.
2,pretentious and shallow,"The acting is excellent, the locales exotic and the cinematography is beautiful. The problem is, it all adds up to nothing but a trio of banal stories from which the director is deperate to extract meaning from coincidence.I suppose one of the Grand Themes is how we are all interconnected, or how it's a small world after all or some such sitcom-level Deep Thoughts. I suppose this might come as a revelation to anyone who's never thought about anything before, but hitting the audience over the head with contrived melodrama and overwrought peril for 2+ hours doesn't make it any less trite.The characters are stereoypes, the script is lazy and superficial, expecting the audience to do the work of supplying motivations to the characters. Any tragedy is generated in the laziest way possible: by contriving extreme, implausible situations.If the movie didn't look so good and didn't have such a strong cast, I wouldn't have given this waste of time any stars."
2,Mish mush,There are several different stories here only slightly related dealing with several different families in separate countries. Nothing that went into a whole. Some of the individual stories were touching. I particularly liked the Moroccan boys story. However overall it left me wondering what is the point of the story.The acting is above average. Not surprising as it has some good actors. The filming is good.
1,Bad things happen to stupid people,"This movie is both stupid and pointless. It is one long and dreary series of bad decisions by stupid people. It is sad and depressing for no good reason at all. There is no redeeming value to the pain and misery inflicted on the characters. It isn't worth making or watching a movie merely because the characters in the story suffer. For pointless suffering I can watch the news.Unless you are a masochist or need to become depressed, don't buy this movie. I am shredding my DVD to make sure it isn't inflicted on anyone else."
1,A Poor DVD,"The concept for this film was a good one. But the execution of the concept was dreadful. Brad Pitt can't act so he was not given much of a part. However, even if he could act, it wouldn't have saved this film from the trash can that I put it in.I felt sorry for the ""wife"" of Brad Pitt. She spent the whole film face down in the dirt. For someone who was shot she did manage to bleed very little and hung on until she could be rescued. There was a lot of gratutious sex, which--if it fit into the story wouldn't have been so bad--but it seemed that it was just something that the film maker put in because the story line was so weak. It was a poor choice and I hope the screen writers find work picking vegetables and leave the stories to those who actually have writing abilities and imaginatiion."
1,"Definition of ""babel""",Confusion of sounds or voices; i.e. see movie of same name. Better yet -- don't waste your time and money.
1,Stinks,"Babel is a collection of seemingly unrelated stories much like Crash and Syriana. The films sucks at least as much as those too. There is no central character, and nobody is a better person for their experiences. This movie is basically the worst day in the lives of several people. The two lessons to be learned from this movie are 1) Do not use occupied vehicles for target practice, and 2) Do not leave the country while babysitting."
5,plain awesome,this movie was greatmexican film makers are amazingi loved how global this movie isand the comparison of cultures
2,Not appropriate for classroom learning,"I was encouraged to use this movie with a Freshman Year experience class in the hopes that there would be some lessons from popular culture. I'm sorry to say that the movie was not helpful. In the same vein as Borat, I feel like less of a person after watching this film. There is no redemption."
3,"Story is full of blahs, acting is great","There's been many so-called ""intertwining"" movies made over the years, and I generally don't like them because they present characters, but don't really tell stories. It's like adapting the phonebook. There's better ones like Short Cuts and Crash that at least have characters and stories I actually cared about. Magnolia was an extreme whole lot of nothing. Babel falls somwhere in the middle.The acting gets an A+ all around, could have won Best Ensamble at the SAGs but the characters are way too isolated from each other the be an ensamble. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett did well pulling out of The Fountain and winding up in this production. The supporting actors carry their segments admirably as well. The problem is whatever resolutions their stories reach, if at all, are very anticlimatic and do not satisfy. This is more of a theatrical and/or rent type movie, not so much a buy-to-own."
4,Interesting and it kept my attention,"No big review here, just that it was interesting and involved 4 separate yet linked events going on around the globe. Brad Pitt more angry than concerned of his wife being shot while Cate Blanchett didn't really get to do much acting, besides laying there. The kids in the village were the key to the movie."
3,Solala,"Well, I expected more of this. Sort of. Or maybe the problem is, I didn't exactly know what to expect.Three quarters of the movie you can listen to something else, just not my type of thing. Maybe because I have my personal Babel since 4 years.The parts were very well played though. Not like a not very convincing Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Their story and acting was at parts very unrealistic and I just didn't buy their play.I hope, the other actors did get as much money for the movie as these two did, for they for sure deserved it more.You can follow the story well, that's one good thing, I guess and I love the part that plays in Marocco."
3,Not for the squeamish,"There's a profound sense of dread throughout this that makes the viewer fear what is coming next. It's not a horror film, though horrific things happen. It doesn't make for comfortable viewing. And it takes awhile for the tapestry that links the three disparate stories to come together. Impressive film-making, I guess, and the captions add to the authentic feel. The message: a feel good theme about home and family. Brad Pitt doesn't have a lot to do here, though he's billed as the star. Others in the film make much more of a splash, such as the Latinos and the Japanese."
2,"""Babel"" Collapses Under Its Own Weight","Director Alejandro González Iñárritu's well-intentioned drama of cross-cultural linkage gradually falls apart due to its narrative contrivances and excessive length. Despite strong performances and stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, ""Babel"" never connects as a satisfying whole. A serious miscalculation is the Tokyo storyline, which belongs in a different movie. Though he captures some powerful moments, Iñárritu's overreaching ambition gets the best of him."
4,Wasn't what I thought it would be but was interesting and Brad Pitt was gorgeous!,This movie wasn't what I expected it to be like BUT it was very good. Gives different viewpoints on how the actions of one person can affect many many lives. Brad Pitt was in it so that is always a great thing to me in any movie. I don't know if you need to own a copy but it is worth it to watch. I only watch movies once so I would have been better off renting it.
2,Dragged on...,"It was great for a Sunday nap. Maybe if I had seen the end I would have felt differently, but I'm not interested in trying again."
1,Terrible,"Maybe it was just me, but neither my husband nor I liked this movie at all and we stopped watching it about 1/2 - 3/4 of an hour in. Just wasn't getting anything out of it!!!!!!!"
1,Hated this movie. End of story.,Thought since Brad Pitt was in the movie it would be decent but don't be fooled. Even though this was free on Amazon it still isn't worth wasting your time.
2,babel,did not like movie..hard to follow.what did the oriental girl have to do with it? confusing and not a good movie
1,Confusing and Boring,"I ended up fast forwarding until the plot started tieing the four separate storylines together (about 1/2 way through the movie) and by then I didn't care any more. The plot drags and it is like watching TV with some one who can't keep his hands off the remote, shifting back and forth between 4 different movies.I am not easily offended, but the total nudity of Rinko Kikuchi acting as a deaf 16 year old offended me. I realize she is older than that in real life, but protraying her as a high school girl made me feel dirty, like I was watching kiddie porn. There are a lot better ways to spend your time than watching this junk (like spending an hour and a half in freeway traffic)."
1,How do I hate this movie? Let me count the ways....,"This movie takes four different story lines, all involving disasters, and weaves them together in pointless tales devoid of character development, plot or purpose. Blanchett and the other cast can't rescue this stinker.I don't find it entertaining to watch people getting shot, or in pain, or sinking into disaster, all for no reason and with no redeeming artistic or intellectual value. This film takes you on a long arduous journey without any destination in sight. I cannot believe it got so many Oscar nominations, or that the script attracted this A-list cast."
1,What was good about this?,"Wow, what a stinker. I was told this was like ""Crash."" I liked Crash - a lot. This movie drags like molasses as we are shown several different stories that so obviously interconnect that you would have to be a simpleton not to connect most of them long before the reveal.But mostly, in between long boring scenes which are supposed to teach us about other cultures I suppose, you get to watch stupid people make stupid decision after stupid decision.My wife and I were talking aloud during the last 30 minutes without even pausing the movie as we discussed the stupid things that were happening and how annoying the whole thing had been.THEN, they wrap it up with a Hollywood ending that leaves almost no one paying real consequences for their actions and even contradict what you have supposedly known the entire movie.This was just plain pathetic. I'm disappointed in humanity that this is considered an acclaimed movie."
2,"Great performances, crappy movie","This film is an overrated mess. 4 stories that are supposed to somehow connect. And yet, 2 out of the 4 really sort of don't and are needless. Especially the Japan one. Was it interesting? To a point, but it also did nothing to enhance or help the film. I found I couldn't symapthize with any of the characters except Brad Pitt's. He did an incredible job portraying a man in distress. I love Cate Blanchett, but even her character was borderline annoying. There was nothing in this film that I truly found to be interesting. It was very bland and dragged quite a bit. All these movies that are supposed to connect characters in some way almost never work. It didn't work for Crash, and this is even worse. I expected so much better."
2,Extremely overrated,"Has some interesting moments, but the politics is simplistic and heavy-handed. The separate storylines do not coalesce convincingly. Don't waste your money on this nonsense."
3,Babel,Plot line too contrived to be realistic; While timelines are always concurrently multi-faceted this one was just too much.
2,2 hour 24 minute waste of time,"Had to pick a movie out of four others and decided to watch this one because of all the acclaim. I wish I had ignored it all. I want that time back. I learned more life lessons watching Legally Blonde 1, 2 AND 3. I feel like the director was taking advantage of the hype surrounding the United States' battle against terror and illegal aliens to make lots of money off of a pseduo foreign film. I don't want to give it only 1 star because the acting was great, but that's pretty much it."
1,One of the Worst Movies I have ever seen!,"For the first half I keep waiting for the real story to start. It never got any better. So if you want to watch a really bad movie with Brad Pit, this is it."
3,emerald33,"A very dramatic emotional film about one incident that affects four families in different countries throughout the world. I still haven't figured out the last scene between the Japanese teenager and her father(she is naked on the balcomy of their apartment holding hands with her father). Anyway, I don't know if I really liked this film or not - I will have to watch it again."
5,Near Master Work,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu can now be considered one the world's first rank directors. With ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams"" he has delivered some of the more compelling cinema of the new Millenium. Both films are connected by a similar theme that despite the distances between people there are also things in this world that bind us together. In ""21 Grams"" the device was the human heart. In ""Babel"" Inarritu uses an inanimate object to connect people from different sides of the hemisphere. The object is insignificant. What Inarritu is really trying to say is that tragedy and the possibility of redemption is the real binding force. Inarritu does a superb job juggling the various story strands as well as filming in different languages. The International cast is uniformly excellent. A challenging film but one worth your while."
1,Another one of 'those',"that doesn't resolve itself. Multiple stories going on at the same time - I don't mind guessing games, but I like films where the guessing ends when the film does. Perhaps this is 'intellectually challenging' for some in college art class,,but this old technique just seems to go on forever. I liked the acting - I liked the visuals. Felt like going down a ladder where the bottom 5 rungs are missing. Academy Award?? Are you kidding??"
3,It was hard to get into it,"I hated the background and environment of this film. I stopped it twice, then went back later. I don't think this was Brad Pitts best performance. Maybe this would have been better on a larger screen but on Kindle it appeared small and uninteresting to me.I eventually watched it all but somehow I couldn't get into it."
4,Three strands with one theme,"Unfortunate decisions seem like irresponsibility as three stories portray people whose rippling mistakes threaten people they love.The camera and its perspectives give the film a sense of universal truths. Besides, there is something 'haunting' about these people and their problems."
1,Bizarre,"One of the oddest movies I have seen. So many bizarre scenes that you keep asking, why, what's the point?"
2,I didn't make it through,Random art film with no plot and no point. I like art films like no country for old men. But this one wasn't going anywhere. I hung in there until almost half way through but I couldn't do any more. Maybe it gets really good and maybe I'll come back to it. But I doubt both because I'm not the only one that thought it had no point. I can watch almost anything but this thing is boring.
1,Wierd and pointless,"It came free with our prime subscription and that was too much to pay for it. The biggest joke is on the title page.. ""Brad Bitt's Best Film"""
2,Babel,"The beginning story line was very good. Not knowing exactly what the movie entailed, I was very confused when the movie changed to the story in Japan which I felt had nothing to do with the beginning story. I thought it was some X-rated movie that somehow got spliced into another movie. I would not have watched it. It took me three times trying to finish the story in Morocco before I realized the kind of movie it was. I even had money refunded for my Kindle because I didn't know what the movie was and apparently they wasn't aware of it at Amazon. Loved the Brad Pitt part."
5,Amazing Film.,"A tale that intertwines throughout different peoples lives, from continent to continent. Everyone's Performance in Babel feels Real. One of the Great Films of 2006 along with ""Sicko""."
1,Goes Nowhere,"This film relates to two popular concepts: the ""butterfly effect"" and ""when it rains it pours."" I feel this film is a slick attempt to manipulate these concepts. In Babel the butterflies are very big and it rains in the desert.A rifle is fired carelessly in Morocco. A Japanese girl is devastated by her mother's death. A nanny decides to take two children under her care across the border into Mexico without their parents' permission. These events all come together and have a traumatic impact on many different people. People suffer in this film.Particularly slick and exploitive is the segment about the deaf teenager. Her story is only very tenuously connected to the others. The viewer must decide why it is included.A lot of money was spent and a couple of star actors were hired. For what purpose? What do we learn? Who was entertained? The actors followed their directions and the script...to nowhere."

2,This movie wasnt that bad but I wouldnt watch it again.,"I liked the story in the middle east, I enjoyed the story in Mexico, But the Japanese part was pointless. If you like movies like 21 Grams, and Crash you'll enjoy this film. If you dont, like me, you'll be waiting for it to finish an hour in a half into it. Unfortunatley, Directors are trying to be someone they aren't. Director's should stop trying to be a Tarantino or Scorsese and just direct films in they're own way. However, if they did that, they wouldnt have a job as a director. The movie's worth watching once when no good movies are available."
3,An interesting excersise,"Three films rolled into one, with Brad Pitt almost ruining the whole thing. Not as good as Amores Peros, but better than 21 Grams. Worth seeing."
2,huh?,"My wife and I looked at eachother with one eyebrow raised basically saying ""huh?"" The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because a couple of the stories were actually interesting, however, they just didn't go anywhere and I was left disappointed. There was no apparent purpose or meaning to this movie.If you are wondering whether or not to watch this movie, please pass this one by."
4,Huh?,"This is a very good movie - about gun violence. It's really not about 'human interconnectivity', as it's been positioned or reviewed by others. In a sense, the gun connects, but it's misleading to say this movie is about interconnecting human lives. This is a movie about a gun and the hell that it wrought. Human beings were merely a conduit."
5,NOT a Crash rip-off.,"BABEL is a great movie. I loved it. Ofcourse opinions are for morons, everyones got one. But here's my two cents. The reason this movie has been getting slammed by the general audience is simply cause Crash stole it's thunder the year before. Dont get me wrong Crash was grea movie too. But both of these movie are nothing alike except for the story telling. Whereas Crash is political, this movie is more on personal family problems. Alejandro González Iñárritu is a great director. Most people aren't aware is of previous work: AMORES PERROS & 21 GRAMS. BABEL is suppose to conclude his 'Death' Trilogy, and I have to say it may not be as heartbreaking as AMORES, but it still delivers. Just becareful cause this is a slow movie and won't play out to wide auidences. Hey same can be said for THE QUEEN, for some reason i dug this movie found the THE QUEEN a complete bore, besides the acting."
1,Waste of Time,"Very low budget, jumps around without really explaining whats going on. The Asian part didn`t even need to be there except they got some young girl to be nude, complete waste."
3,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:","THEIS FIM COVERS 5 STORIES AT ONCE, ALL GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME. NOT ENOUGH BRAD PITT IN IT. JUMPS AROUND TOO MUCH JM"
1,I don't understand all the holaah about this garbage,"This movie is so overrated! I found it boring, confusing, with no plot and no resolution at the end. You will literally end the movie thinking ""and the point of it all was...?????"". I am still wondering how in the world it ended being nominated for an Oscar (I guess Paramount had money to buy a nomination). I like movies to challenge my intelligence, not insult it. And I felt very insulted to have wasted almost three hours watching this garbage."
2,Smut for Art's Sake,"Let's see.. When it's not being cloyingly sentimental and deeply manipulative, it's leeringly voyeuristic. In short, it's a shoo-in for Best Picture!Its politically correct themes are delivered with the subtlety of a steam roller. America..? Bad! Indigenous peoples..? Noble and exploited! Guns..? REALLY BAD!Then there's the deaf girl who can't seem to keep her pants on. If I want to see teenage girls flashing their underparts, the internet is full of it. But that's not ""art""..Art. Is that what these people really believe they're making? Behind the admittedly impressive craft and technique is a pathetic deficit of wisdom. This movie could have been the brainchild of a very gifted 8th grader, someone who knew very little and had experienced even less. Don't send your kid to film school."
2,BORING,"I thought the movie was too long and boring... I just wanted it to get to the point, which never came cause the movie had no point. The only thing I learned was never travel out of the country."
1,Aptly named,I don't care for movies that appear to start in the middle. There are 3 or were there 4 stories going on in this movie and each one appeared to start in the middle. Finally after almost an hour they start putting them together. I also found myself wondering why anyone would travel to a foreign country without knowing how to speak their language. It's bad enough this type of thing happens in America but at least help is more available and most would be speaking English. Definitely check this one out from your local library before buying it.
1,Far Left Propaganda Film! Pro sexuality in minors.Pro drugs.Anti Second Amendment/anti gun.Pro illegal immigration.AntiAmerican.,If you are far left and hate America this is your favorite film or close to it...so if it is please go live in a communist/socialist country.Thankyou!
4,"Don't get excited, it's only cake.","This movie takes a very unique look at the cultural and linguistic barriers that exist in our world. I really enjoyed the way Babel incorporates stories from families living in different parts of the world and ties them together. Not quite a five star for me, but still very interesting."
5,Love this movie,"This movie has definitely grown on me. I liked it the first time I saw it at a theatre, but the second time really grabbed me. There were subtleties that I had missed, and I appreciated the acting much more. Subsequent viewings have simply deepened my affinity for it. It's not for everyone, but it is for me. I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who has never seen it, especially if you enjoyed Traffic and/or Crash."
3,Not so good....not so bad,"This movie is not as good as so many reviewers claim, but not as bad as others tell me it is. It is somewhere in between.The movie is too unnecessarily long, why do we have to watch the mexican caretaker walk through the desert for so long? a minute or a minute and a half had been enough time to make us aware of her predicament; and the sequence of the deaf-mute japanese girl in the ballroom seemed like it went forever,I fast forwarded a lot of it, it should have been shortened, for that matter the entire ""japanese tale"" should have been edited out and I think it has been a better film.This is one DVD that I will not keep in my collection, since I'm sure that I will never view it again."
2,What was the point?,"Throughout this movie, I kept having the thought, ""What's the point, here?"" There were supposed to be three or four different cultures portrayed here, all tied to one another in a tragical way. But, so many scenes were entirely unnecessary.(SPOILERS)It was unnecessary to show a young boy masturbating, this had absolutely nothing to do with the film, and, if anything, was disturbing and perverted.It was unnecessary to show the entire point of view of the undersexed (though, still a virgin), deaf-mute, asian girl whose father supposedly started the chain of events. Her entire part in the movie was boring and had NOTHING to do with the story.It was unnecessary to show Amelia (the children's keeper), have a makeout session at the party following the marriage. And what point did the marriage have in this movie, for that matter?This movie was ridiculous and pointless, not to mention, hard to follow. Don't waste your money!"
1,Don.t waste your time,I found this film to be one of the most confusing I have seen in years. The story line was extremely weak and by the end of the film I was wondering why it was even produced.
3,Not great a bit vulgar,"I really didn't like this movie much although the acting was outstanding.Some actors definitely deserved academy award nominations for having to portray unscrupulous and perhaps mentally unbalanced characters. There are 3 movies in one in various locations around the world that have a connection.The movie was slow to get started and I just became impatient with the bad decisions most of characters were making.It was pretty easy to figure out the bad results.I felt sorry for and disgusted by some of the characters and some prolonged and continual scenes were unnecessary. I don't think I needed to continually see a particular characters nudity (We get it). Even though it was just acting, the amount of time the director spent on filming a child masturbating made me feel like this must be what child pornography is about.I guess the point the film was trying to make was about miscommunication. What a long unpleasant road it took to get there.If you have to see it ""rent"" it."
1,Babel ...You will never get the 3 hours back!,"The definition of Babble is to utter in an incoherent, foolish, or meaningless fashion. Which this movie does for more then 2 1/2 hours. It's supposed to be 3 stories woven togther, but comes off as 1 story with 2 other ""stories"" paperclipped to it. I really was floored after I endured this movie, to find that some of the acters were actually nominated for Oscars. WTF? Like I have heard in the past, I only gave this one star because I had too. I wouldn't have wasted my time writing this, if this movie wasn't so hyped and horrible."
2,Hard to stay awake...,"This film is really boring, filled with non-sense and poor production.How can this movie can be nominated for seven Academy Awards ? I really don't know. It is supposed to be Brad Pitt's best performance...I disagree, he is very common actor in this one. He has done better in almost any of the film he was involved. Bad and boring film..."
1,Pathetic!,"Very bad acting and even worse plot. One of the worst movies I ever tried to watch. I tossed it in the garbage after the 1st viewing. Ten minutes into the movie they have an extended scene showing a 16 year old guy masturbating. Yes, they have an extended scene showing the guy masturbating. I DID NOT WANT A SNUFF FILM!"
1,BORING! ONE OF THE WORST FILMS OF 2006,"WOW, it shocks me that so many people write glowing reviews of this film! I just rented it and thought it was BORING! I had trouble staying awake while watching it the film was so boring! The Film goes NOWHERE, it tries so hard to be like those far superior films TRAFFIC and CRASH but it doesnt even get off the ground. The stories dont seem to connect and the characters are so forgettable. It didnt surprise me that the film didnt win many oscars, shouldnt have even been nominated . Trust me, your time is to valuable to waste your time with this mess. Its a shame because Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are Excellent Actors but they were wasted in this film. I HATED IT!"
3,simply running out of ideas.,"watching this movie gives me the feeling that script writers are realy running out of good any real good ideas. this movie was too much ado about, well the fact that a japanese hunter gave a rifleto his guide it was not necessary to watch the whole fiasco about his spoilt teenage daughter.all one sees from kate (great actor) well, not much. just in partial coma and total spoken words by her well, not even apage of script but much to much grawling and moaning. great waste of good actors like brad and kate in this very forgetable movie."
3,Can't enjoy a movie when all I do is read subtitles,I want to enjoy a movie. This film was almost all subtitles. If I had known that I would have never watched.
3,A bit odd,"This is a very odd and confusing movie. I liked it bc it kept me wanting to keep watching it just to figure out what was going on. One the other hand, at the end of the movie my husband and I found ourselves saying 'really, that was it?' Some of the scenes were so odd and days afterwards I would think about how weird they were. Not sure I would tell someone 'oh, you have to watch this movie, it's really good.' If you have seen everything else and just want something to watch, this movie is worth watching."
3,Not bad but not good,"This film, since it won some Academy Awards and getting positive fame around the globe, giving me great enthusiasm. However, the film was more than difficult, it was kind of boring.I really liked the theme or shall I say concept of the film, but it is no denying that the film was advertised more like a exciting spectacular film. If the film were advertised more accordingly to the film I might not had this type of dissapointment.Moreover, as a Japanese, I don't like how Japan was described in the film. There ain't no high school girls like Rinko in Japan! Their fascion was like that of more than 5 years ago!Last but not least, I really liked the score of this film."
1,I do not see the attraction to this movie,"I waited several years to watch this movie and was very disappointed, it was not the movie I thought it would be. What the hell, a couple goes to Morocco to get over the death of their sun and leaves their kids with an illegal alien that takes them over the Mexican border to the middle of nowhere, then leaves them in the dessert to die. And what the hell was the deal with the mute/horney Japanese girl. Just seemed like a movie about people making dumb choices. I've read other reviews about how some people say it's about ""human psychology and behavior"", and we all can relate to this movie....? I know when I was a teenage girl I did strange drugs and ran around wearing no panties and flashed people in public places. In real life most normal people do not deal with tragedies or to everyday life in general the way his movie portrays. I can't believe it made that much money at the box office....I don't get the appeal of this movie."
2,Forgettable and Far Too Self-Important,"The sweeping shots of mountains are at first awe-inspiring, then soon start to resemble something from a National Geographic special.There's a lot of ""The Ugly American"" message in the story (as if there aren't any poor people in America), and the message is delivered in a very heavy-handed, bludgeoning way.Brad Pitt phones this one in. There's nothing really memorable here; there's no humor to lighten the heavy plot.""The Constant Gardener"" is a much better film. Rent that instead."
1,Babel or Babble,"A boring, rambling movie with gratuitous, graphic nudity (not involving a return benefit). I was glad I didn't buy a ticket or spend money to rent this movie either on cable or at a video store. I checked it out from the local library. Doesn't surprise me that Brad Pitt was involved, but I was surprised that Cate Blanchett chose to waste her talent on a lesser quality movie like this one. This movie does have some value and that is that I learned Babel and Babble have similar meanings and a combination of the two pretty much describes this movie:Babel: A confusion of sounds or voices b: a scene of noise or confusion.Babble: To utter meaningless or unintelligible sounds."
2,Wildly overrated by film critics,"This film is basically 4 interconnected stories that are suppose to make us walk out of the theatre and think about our social values concerning immigration, sex and gun control, i doubt many people will walk out thinking about anything other than the fact they are glad the movie ended and that they can go and do something more fun with their time. This film will be quickly forgotten by the vast majority of the people who watch it and if it does win the oscar for best picture than i guess the fix is in with the academy that votes for these awards. the acting is fine but i cant see how 2 of the people in this film got nominated for best supporting actress unless this was a really weak year for that category. in summation - dont waste your time and money on this turkey."
2,Stupid characters ruin the rest of it,"Okay, the positives first: great soundtrack and scenery; good performances.Otherwise, as noted by Sake Drinker and some other reviewers, many of the characters are so incredibly stupid that it's a wonder they lived this long. Hiring a nanny who's in the country illegally, taking your employer's kids into another country without permission, allowing your drunken moron of a nephew to drive you and two kids through the desert, jeopardizing the health and welfare of a bus full of people, taking your wife into a nasty little village with no sanitation to see a doctor with dirty fingers...all of these are acts of stupidity committed in the film. Apparently, they took Stupid Lessons from the characters in House of Sand and Fog."
1,"Confusing, disjointed, pointless",Reasonably well-acted. Poorly photographed. Very poorly written. Hard to understand how a turkey like this can get all those nominations. Must have something to do with industry politics. Not worth buying.
1,Horrible,The worst movie I ever saw in my life. I want the 2 hrs of my life back. It was pointless and made no sense. I wouldn't even give it one star.
1,A true stinker!,"Here is Hollywood trying to act like PBS with a pretentious, long-winded story line that is a true waste of a precious evening off! And trust me, PBS woulda turned this turkey down in a heartbeat.Pitt and Blanchett hereby go on our ""downgrade list"" of stars after pretty much just showing up on an Algerian set with nothing much meaningful to do except look uncomfortable and confused (and that wasn't acting, we all were)."
2,"""Crash"" with a passport","Haven't film fans suffered enough with these multi character films that center on race relations, communication misunderstandings ? After last years worst film of the year ""Crash"" (I know the Academy disagreed with me on that one) we get ""Babel"" another over wrought hit them of the head film about modern day race relations. I give this film one more star than I gave ""Crash"" because Cate Blanchett was in it and the story involving the Japanese teenager was interesting. Like ""Crash"" there were plenty of ""oh brother are they serious"" moments. The final moments when it is revealed how all the stories are connected was well can you say STRETCH. Oh well at least the Academy had the good sense not to repeat last years debacle."
1,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.,"This movie is so disjointed that you watch it hoping to understand what's going on. Brad Pitt, who I think is great, walked through his role, what there was of it. Kate Blanchard was the heroin that you couldn't like. Everyone else in the movie did what you would expect them to do, no orginality. I flat cannot recommend this movie to anyone, Academy awards aside."
2,Not bad...But not great...,"I have to say I liked about half of this movie. The Japanese deaf mute story was a bit much however, in a word pointless. I'm glad I rented it and didn't see it in the theaters, at least on dvd I could ff all the parts that just dragged on and on and on. I found the the story that revolved around Morocco and Mexico very interesting, but they could have excluded the whole Japanese story completely as far as I'm concerned. Just when things got interesting in Morocco it cut to Japan and I kept thinking come on get on with it. The Mexican party scene also dragged on way too long. The movie had a nasty habbit of getting me interested and then a minute later boring the holy hell out of me. I give it two stars because two out of the three stories were interesting. It reminded me of Thin Red Line, a bit too bold for its own good and yet parts did manage to impress me."
4,Babel,"this is a very good movie. it's a good Drama and brad pit plays an awesome role. The only problem i have with it that most of it was in subtitles, nonthless it was a good drama."
3,What A Dumb Movie,"This movies is about dumb arses: one after another, after another. Good performances by the actors tho. And, 'full frontal' from that Japanese chick!"
1,Self-indulgent but kinda obvious; doesn't deserve the hype.,"I am not a paid reviewer. There are some good performances in this, mostly of the child actors, and the dialogue sounds realistic which is a refreshing change for Hollywood. However, the plot is interminable and the time it takes for the tale to spin doesn't justify the message being delivered by the film. It seems like a film that the actors wanted to do, not that the audience wanted to see."
1,Yawn........,"Not my thing at all, found it messy, misjointed and as movies are really about being entertained from the comfort of something like a Layzboy, this was hard work to the point I turned it off and pulled the cork out of a bottle of wine and called it a night."
1,Brad Pitt's MASTERPIECE,"BABEL is like traveling through an elaborate hedge maze to get to Jessica Simpson's high school sociology report.Pitt gives yet another of his towering, multi-layered performances. The black hole vacuum he creates on the screen is so great it even sucks in the usually brilliant Kate Blanchett. Not for one minute will you believe the scenario these two play out.Kudos to one solitary brilliant moment when a deaf-mute attends a rave club (though its relation to the film is laughable, as is this whole story thread). The rest of the movie plays out like a bad remake of TALES OF MANHATTAN, only this time with a gun instead of a hat.I can think of episodes of Three's Company that had more original, profound statements to make than this film."
4,A suprisingly good movie,"The biggest surprise for me is that Brad Pitt gave such an excellent performance, I am not one of his fans and find his acting rather flat, but in this one he comes alive and really shines. The story is an excellent self-examination of just how ignorant most of us are about the other."
2,iritating,"The feeling is of being trapped in a nightmare-everything that can go wrong will go wrong(the marrocan kids will shoot someone, japanese girl will get in some trouble, something will go wrong with the kids in Mexico), you don't really grasp the whole story and you can't wake up.And when you wake up you ask yourself why?Otherwise, too long, good performance of characters, some disturbing scenes, and the biggest problem is that the story doesn't catch you."
1,Don't bother...,There is a reason this only made 18 million in the states...it is a Crash ripoff. That amount of money couldn't have even covered Brad and Cates's salaries. Don't waste your money.
1,"If you like stupid movies about stupid people, watch this one.",The storylines are stupid and the characters are stupid. What a waste of time.
4,Not Brad Pitt....Bad Pritt,"This movie was on the screen sometimes ago in Switzerland.Much to say that it's not a bad movie at all for those of Brad Pitt's fans.The story relates more to how careless some adults can be in guarding little ones.On some opinians,not mine anyway,the little ones should be cared by those who have knowledges,not by those who are just bigger.My nephew called me that evening and said,""Don't you want to see Bad Pritt?"".I said,""No,my dear,it's Brad Pitt!!"""
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this movie before seeing it. The movie turned out to be very slow-moving, which would have been okay except that I didn't care about any of the characters except for the deaf teenager."
1,Awful,"This is a perfect example of what happens when a decent idea is poorly developed. A shame.We waited for it--it being the plot, and characters worth caring about. And now that the movie is over, we are still waiting. Even though there were several interesting aspects, overall it was a waste of the concept."
1,Another smart movie,"I am tired of these supposedly smart movies. Oh Pulp Fiction was a gem when it came out in 1994. In Babel the stories are simple and not that dramatic. For me it was just paining to drag it out any longer. Because of a lack of individual character development, I just didn't feel much for any of them. That can suck if that is exactly the motive of a movie such as in Babel. No I'm not a bad person its just that Babel is a movie and movies need to draw you in. Its not like I would be fine with these things happening in my own life.As for the music and scenery, its OK, but this is a movie and not a musical piece or work of art. It seems like not all the components are present to make a good film. Babel seems overrated and I wonder if this has anything to do with Brad Pitt being in it? At the least, I think the title works quite well for the film."
2,"""Babel"" - left wing Hollywood does it again","What did I learn from watching ""Babel""?1. Never leave your kids alone with a Mexican Nannie.2. Being a Tokyo dentist has its perks.3. Americans - just stay the F out of the Middle East.Of course, the way this movie is produced is you're supposed to feel bad for the drunk Mexican endangering the lives of two little kids, and the ""bad guys"" are the border patrol officers who try to help them.We are also supposed to feel bad for two Morrocan kids who shoot an innocent American tourist, and a Japanese deaf/mute slut (I'm not kidding) who flashes her snatch all over Tokyo.I give this movie a ""C"", unless you're a smarter than the rest of us liberal movie reviewer, who all loved this lame movie."
1,Self-indulgent and irrelevant,"This movie is SO over-rated. This movie is pointless and boring.I swear, every time a movie is 150 minutes, it should ALWAYS be 45 minutesshorter. There is so much schlock footage, just wasting screen time.Ok, so three different stories about communication problems. WHO CARES?!?!The movie had no intrigue, intellectual stimulation, or emotional pull.This movie is flat out dull. Don't waste your time, I beg of you."
1,Brain Damage,"I was so dissapointed in Babel. Just because a movie is filmed well doesn't mean that it is a good movie. If you want to fall asleep fast, take some Babel."
2,What the hell was that?,"That's 2 hours and 23 minutes that I'll never get back.Highly overrated and overblown, there are some great scenes and some great acting in this movie, but at the end of the day, you'll be shaking your head.I especially loathed the story of the deaf-mute Asian girl and her sexual difficulties.Critics and Amazon scribes fell all over themselves praising this ""epic"".Maybe if it was an hour shorter.I kept wanting to fast-forward.Cate Blanchett is wasted in this role and to call this Brad Pitt's best performance, is just laughable."
3,Goes off on a tangent,"This movie is definitely one of the stranger ones that I have seen. It has a lot of good scenes (especially in Morocco, with the 2 boys and the tour bus shooting). While I understand the close connection between the Morocco situation and the California/Mexico situation, with a married couple and their children, I was thrown off by the constant shifting to Japan. The only connection between Japan and the other situations was that a Japanese guy sold a hunting rifle to a Moroccan man who then sold it to another Moroccan man who gave it to his sons, who then fired on the tour bus. However, this connection is so indirect that it becomes a little absurd to include it. The whole Mexico situation was a little disturbing, to put it nicely."
1,Defective HD-DVD,"I watched this movie with much anticipation. However, it is impossible to evaluate a movie in which two-thirds of the dialog is not in english when the Captioning system does not work. I also use the XBox HD-DVD player, so I can't say if the DVD or the player has problems, but the movie was rendered incomprehensible by the flawed captioning. You could only see half of the dialog. Don't buy this movie - rent it and make sure it plays properly."
1,I give it an F-,Think of the four most boring movies you've ever seen. Now imagine what would happen if you took the MOST boring scenes from each of the four films and edited them together to make one super-boring movie. You have now imagined BABEL.
2,Babel,"A triumph in redundancy. The entire Mexican wedding and its aftermath added little to the central story of the impact on the lives of a married couple of American tourists on a bus tour in Morocco when one is senselessly shot by an Arab kid trying out an illegal rifle. The resultant collapse of the Arab family as a unit was touching. The rifle belonged to a Japanese hunter who gave it to his Arab guide who sold it to the Arab family. It transpires that the Japanese hunter has a deaf-mute teenage daughter with alienation problems heightened by her intact virginity. Why the focus should be on her and not the bereaving widower father escapes me. The only telling point was that everyone failed in ""talking"" to the other."
2,One Weird Movie,"For such a long movie, it sure didn't have much of a point. Best thing about it was the Moroccan dessert scenery. Lots of goats and goat women... It was a waste of talent and time. My advice is to give this one a miss."
4,Friends and the movies,Seen it in the theatre ..and loved it ...as part of a non serial of movies by Latino directors ...That are friends of course...and it seems that they are in competition with each otherThe audience is the winner....period!
5,A rare gem,This is a difficult CD to find. I had to buy it at one of those Amazon's zshop.Tht being said the Music is marvelous. Once again James Horner composed some orinigal music. For a children's movie it does not sound childish (maybe a little). I highly reccommand this for all of Horner's fans. If you like this CD I would reccomend Willow and Land Before Time (Both composed by Horner) as well.
2,For completists only,"There are some good songs on here, but I just don't enjoy listening to this one nearly as much as my other David Barbe recordings. At least three of the songs (Beer Commercial, Anyone, Where Diamonds Are Halos) were performed with Sugar in 1995 and they just sound so much better with a more capable band. Part of this is due to really primitive production. You can tell it was recorded on 4-track. The lo-fi sound just doesn't work as well here as it does with other bands. The bottom line is that you could probably do without this one."
2,Not very good,"I assumed that this product will be good but, after installing i found bubbling and corner raising issue. due to this is covering out side of the screen little more. if it has .5 cm less in each side it shouldn't have these issues.after spending a lot of time i could bale to fix with few bubbles."
2,you get what you pay for,"I got these binoculars to leave in my car in case I forgot my other binoculars when I go birding or in case I saw an interesting bird or animal when I was driving around. The price was right and I did not expect much and got it. The optics are poor and the view thru the right lense is slightly distorted. Still, they fulfill the job I got them for and if they get stolen it's not like they were really expensive."
5,"Quick and easy setup, solid net","Nothing to not like, really. Comes already nestled in its carrying case, sets up in a couple minutes, works perfectly. Tears down in a minute.Works great for soccer, too. Just be sure to use the stakes and keep this securely anchored. Otherwise a strong gust of wind can blow it down, as could a corner kick or very errant knuckler.Seems well-made and should last many years.Good value for the money.Any kid who loves to toss or kick the ball would love this net. Big kids too."
1,does NOT perform,I just finished using the Quickster(tm) 5' x 5' for the first time with my 14 year old son. He hit 60 balls off a tee and 60 soft toss. Out of the 120 balls hit into the net guess how many stayed in the net......3 balls. This product should be called a pitch-back. We spent more time chasing balls than hitting.TERRIBLE product !Glad I kept my receipt.
2,One and done,"I just used this SKLZ net one time during a 12U softball tournament and realized the net was sagging. After inspecting it I realized the two tabs that keep it bowed on the bottom have broken off. I like the net the easy set up and my team liked it, so I am ordering a replacement and hopefully the first one was a defective part. If not I will send this back and get a ""Big Mouth"" net hopefully it will be more reliable."
5,Great product!!,"Assembly could not be easier, the first assembly may have taken all of 5 minutes. It is sturdy enough that the anchors are not necessary. We were able to setup in an indoor facility and hit balls off of a tee into the net without the net turning over or moving. Would highly recommend."
4,Gets the job done,"After reading many reviews I decided to purchase the SKLZ 7x7 net to use in the basement for soft toss drills. We have been happy with the net and overall quality. The frame is sturdy, light and easy to put together. The largert 7x7 net stops the balls from going all over the place (I think the 5x5 would have been too small). We haven't used this outdoors yet, but it looks like we'll have to stake it in to the ground to keep it from blowing over. The only thing I want to caution people about is that when balls are hit hard enough in to the net, they tend to bounce back out near your feet - the black strip that runs across the bottom doesn't always keep the balls in, but the net slows them down enough that it hasn't caused a dangerous situation. Overall, I would highly recommend this net - especially for the price."
1,Broken elbows on corner,I purchased this for my son and he was only able to use it a couple of times before the elbow at the corner broke. My son was in the process of moving the unit and only moved it a few feet when the plastic elbow broke. I tried to repair it with epoxy but was unsuccessful. I like the net but it would seem the plastic elbows could be stronger or perhaps made of metal.
3,Somewhat flimsy,"This practice target is of a good size. It is also strong enough to withstand the impact of a baseball thrown by average pitchers.If you want to leave it in the yard or driveway, however, soon a storm will bring strong enough wind to wreak havoc on it. For multi-year usage, I recommendATEC Pro Pitcher's Practice Screen with Stand. I have had it for 5 years. It is a little beaten up but still usable."
5,Excellent design and function,I read nothing but positive reviews and I'm here to simply offer 1 more. Quality build and simple setup make this the perfect product to help your youngsters improve their skills. We're very impressed with the Quickster.
5,Awesome net for hitting stations!,"If you're like me, you have been reading review after review, looking at picture after picture, trying to figure out what hitting net to invest your $100-$150 in. Stop researching and buy this net now! I use it for my 9-10 year old team and utilize it for several different soft toss hitting stations. After about a month of use, it seems to be holding up very well (these kids are tough on it).I also have the net that ""folds"" up in a circle. Does anyone ever really figure out how to get them back into the carrying case? The SKLZ 7X7 net is sooooo easy to set up and take down (under a minute for each). After dissasembly, it actually will go back into the easy to tote carry bag!I am very picky about the equipment I invest in for my team, and I am absolutely pleased with this net!"
4,Boy I wish they had this 45 years ago,"Got this for a nephew who's name I can't recall....funny how a growing family can cause problems like that. But what's his name was very appreciative of the gift , and it was nice to see his father using it with him.'The kid is going into Little League this year , and this will hopefully help him perform better"
5,"Fast, durable, functional","Sets up fast, comes with duffle-like parts bag, with stakes. Get the full 7' x 7' product, don't settle for less. I would recommend this to others."
5,best of class,"Challenge: fill an office with soft high quality music with CD capability from an ancillary bookshelf unit. I own a BA Receptor radio used as bedroom clock radio and love it for the sensitivity of the tuner (best classical FM is 50-60 miles away), so I went to the BA CD Microsystem. See my review of that: two successive units had defective CD players. The Tivoli tuner is just about as sensitive as the BA, and the Model Two has the advantage of stereo separation via the separate speaker. You have to use the ""old KLH"" analog tuner to become a believer that it's as accurate as any digital. The subwoofer is a useful and desireable addition to round out the sound. The BA Recepter has more base and has a ""sweeter"" sound, but maybe too sweet. The Tivoli Two seems more natural or even, and with the subwoofer the base is quite adequate (yes, there is a slight weak-signal hiss). I have it on for hours each day and it's a wonderful companion."
1,Very poor reception,"This receiver has terrible reception. And that's with *an antenna attached; using the radio's internal antenna brings nothing but static all across the dial, both AM and FM. I have two clock radios -- one of which is a twenty-plus year old Radio Shack cassette/clock/radio -- that gets stellar reception compared to the Tivoli. It's to Tivoli's credit that the static sounds great. But that's no reason to buy this radio. I've never been so disappointed."
2,not all that,"It's ok at best. The ugly white cord and white antenna make for a real eye soar, I can't see how it would look good anywhere except your kitchen."
2,Stereo mode didn't work for auxiliary mode,I love the way this looks but the functionality just wasn't there. At this price point that just didn't make sense. I ended up with another Tivoli product but found that for the cost this should work better. The Stereo mode didn't work (the 2nd speaker) when I was using the auxiliary input. Returned and got the iPal and am very happy.
2,terrible workmanship,"Great sound, nice looks, when it works. The main, on off etc, switch shorts out leaving the stereo mono. I baby my equipment and this just fell apart. I rarely used it. It went bad just about the day the warranty expired. Won't ever buy from them again."
4,Good but could be better,"Excellent sound, would be better with remote to turn on and off and control volume. Hard to read writing on front panel. No tone control.JHP"
5,I could not believe ...,"... the sound that came out of this stereo when I first tried it out! I had listened to Bose Wave system before I bought Tivoli 2. I decided for tivoli2 based of price and reviews, and I'm glad I did. It's hard to imagive such small speakers can deliver such rich and colorful sound until you actually hear it.The radio reception is extraordinary with the provided FM antena (which is just a piece of wire).I find myself using the AUX input more than radio. It makes a high end jukebox once you plug in your 60 GB of mp3's.As far as the appearance goes, I don't think I could be happier. Very simple, yet elegant. Excelent deal overall."
4,Excellent radio,"I have owned this radio for a couple of years now, and am pretty pleased with it. I use it as computer speakers along with the Tivoli subwoofer. I have also hooked up an ipod dock, and both sound amazing. I love the retro look, the finish on the main unit is excellent, the other speaker not so much..So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, 2 things. The finish on the satellite speaker is not good, it is white and splotchy, which really detracts from the unit's attractiveness. It probably should have not been released as a first quality unit because of that. The other is that radio stations just do not stay in tune, and usually have some static. Since I rarely use it for the FM tuner that's not a huge deal for me, but it is annoying."
2,it's ok,it smells okay I guess I'm just not a fan of the sent. It didn't really do anything to my skin except dry it out. Did not help clear any acne or prevent any acne. It didn't leave my skin peeling smooth. It just didn't work very well for my skin
5,exfoliates like no other,"great face wash, it exfoliates very well and leaves your face feeling tight afterwards. some people don't like that b/c it indicates its leaving your face dry. it does leave a bit of a residue. used this for years and its done a good job for my skin."
5,love this product!,"Really love this product.It works well in cleansing my skin, leaving it feeling smooth and fresh."
5,Wonderful!,"This is wonderful, beautiful and a great joy to listen to. The music, the lyrics and the greatness of Bing Crosby's voice combine for a joyfyul experience. The other people singing with him are very good as well. Everybody who comes to my house gets to hear this and everybody has a great time listening to it. There are beautiful and moving love songs. And several that are full of fun and laughs. And when the music starts, the feet want to move and dance! I love it."
5,great sound,"I enjoy singing along, great practice in building up your bass strength for, I don't know..."
5,Fabulous Hard to find CD,This is a great collection of all the great Irish tunes sung by one of the greatest crooners of the century. You won't be disappointed!
5,Just like being there,Reading Kristin Espinasse's first book is just like walking along the paths and sidewalks of rural France. She knows how to reveal enough of her personal life to make it real for the reader. She is very generous with her life--sharing it with her readers in a way that brings it alive.
4,Pleasurable and fun to read if you like France and French!,Kristin also writes a blog and the book is a glimpse into her life as an American who marries a French wine producer! Vocabulary and anecdotes are fun!
5,FRESH,A WONDERFUL FRESH BOOK THAT ADDS DIMENSION TO WORDS IN FRENCH TO MAKE THEM MORE MEMORABLE FOR A STUDENT. LIGHT AND PERSONAL AND A GREAT AID TO MAKE A LANGUAGE YOUR FRIEND. WELL DONE!
4,helpful,"Easy to use, Painless vocabulary growth. For me it works. Also has a "" word a day "" website which is very helpful."
3,A bit light-weight,"Purchased this to read before spending a couple of weeks in Provence, and happy to find a book set in that specific area of France. However, interesting as most of the short vignettes are, I don't feel that these are the terms and phrases that I'm likely to need to have on the tip of my tongue."
2,"Luckily, France actually is more interesting than this","The general notion is excellent, but the vignettes themselves are too mundane to hold the attention of anyone but the most generous of spirit. Simple, pastoral tales can be entertaining--witness ""A Year in Provence""--but these ones are almost entirely without interest. Reading this book may be a more boring way to learn French words than simply memoraizing them."
5,Dreaming in French with Kristy!,"Kristy writes with charming simplicity! Her words capture our imagination taking us behind the blue shutters of Provence. There her hand opens wide the view of the life we dream to see inside...cupboards full of homemade goodness, baskets stacked high of humor, dresser drawers overflowing with lavender-scented laundry! Kristy shows us her family, their lives in France, with her collection of tender hearted love and words that you want gobble up page by page!A wonderful, delightful, enchanting book to help you learn French while eating a baguette and saying, ""Bien Bien Encore!"""
3,On the small side,"Great shades, but they really are on the small side. I've relegated them to wearing in the car, too small and windy for riding."
3,LIKE A CHILDS SUNGLASSES,"Great looking product and nice quality- but very very narrow. If you have a large head look elsewhere. Probably giving them to my son, more his size"
3,Original Kd's Biker Shades,Glasses were nice but too small for me. Looked more like glasses for a child. But they did look like they were well made.
2,Disapointed,"I am a spin instructor and purchased this video in the hopes that it would give me some new and exciting ideas for my class. The title ""Super Cycle"" is misleading. This video is basic. Level of energy is low. It is a good video for the basic beginner in spin, and that's it."
3,A bit too cheesy for me,"If you have ever taken a spin class at your gym you are probably used to the loud music that 'gets you in the zone'. If this is what motivates you...this is not the dvd for you. This dvd is ok for most part, but I personally like the music to motivate the cadence not a imagining a dog is chasing you. Just my personal opinion"
1,Mindy Mylrea: Super Cycle: The Best Ride in Town,"Most of the disc content was ""missing"" .. The presentation began on the disc somewhere past the half way mark .. A total waste of time and money .. In addition to which I paid extra for next day delivery , which did not occur .. I received the package two days later anyway .."
2,Boring ride,I purchased this based on the reviews and I was really disappointed. The trainer at my local rec center does a much better workout program than this.
3,Not all that!!!!,Nothing great about this DVD... very little instructional information provided and despite adding scenery the whole ride was quite a bore!!
2,Not my style.,"Not your typical spin class instructor. I can't get into her style of coaching. She just doesn't seem ""real"" to me."
2,I didn't like it,This product was boring. I did it once and now it is sitting in my video basket collecting dust. The delivery service was good though!
2,Get ready to be bored,Very disapointing. Should've had much more bike scenery than a just a few seconds here and there. Instead you're stuck watching ol'Mindy huff-and-puff as she peddles her thick thighs throughtout your workout.
5,A Wonderful Book!,"I had a chance to read this book because my roommate received this copy from the author, who was handing out free copies to UCLA students. I was jealous that I did not get the free copy. And after reading my friend's book, I ordered a copy from Barnes and Noble bookstore. I think every Korean should own a copy of this. This is a proof of Korean leadership in western universities. Koreans are not only academically smart, we Koreans are social leaders who bring about social good. This book inspires me to be a better social leader, not just for Koreans but for all people of color."
4,This is a classic rock cd.,It belongs in everybody's CD collection. Temptation is a rock masterpiece! THis is up there as one of my favorite CD's as well as THey Might Be Giant's John Henry!
5,Semisonic- The Great Divide,This is the best album ever. My favorite song of all is Falling. I saw them in concert and they were excellent. You must own this.
5,Pleasing spring,"One of my favorite CDs. And a very rare one of those CDs, which you can't listen, unless you're in a certain mood and the world around you is in the same mood.All of the songs, even the sad ones, have such a certain upbeat, new, comforting, confidently fresh tone to them that I personally can not listen Great Divide unless it's spring (or autumn) and I feel great.I had the privilige to listen the Band live in Chicago back in 1998 and would recommend everybody to see them in concert. Not only for the lively performance you'd expect from them but to just see three guys doing what they love to do, enjoying themselves, really caring for the fans and absorbing and reflecting back all the positive feedback in their music. I'm all keeps!"
5,Phenomenal braided line,"I have used just about every type of braided line on the market for Salmon in the Pacific Northwest and Tuf-Line XP out preforms them all. First off, the coating on XP is much stronger and doesn't fade as easily as Power Pro. Secondly, the line diameter is small in comparison to the competition. Overall, XP is a much better line for the price."
3,Ok quality for the price,"Fishing this line mainly from the public piers, the quality is not that great. After just the first few casts the line already started to fray. Though I did not specifically test the weight of the line, I am sure that it has caused a significant decrease in the maximum weight of the line. The line seems to tangle quite often. I would sometimes reel it in and find that my whole rig was intwined with the line. I would not recommend this line for the more serious fisherman, rather I would suggest going with a something more along the lines like Berkeley or Power Pro.As a novice, or somebody who may only fish once or twice every 6 months or so, this is a very well priced line that will let you get out there and catch something big. It is strong enough to handle the occasional entanglement with kelps which reduces lost of tackle."
5,Strong sequel,"I watched Into the Storm tonight, a beautiful HBO film starring Brendan Gleeson. I'm not sure if it is because Gleeson has always been one of my more favorite actors, but this film really worked for me. Beautifully played, with a to me quite emotional ending, but also throughout a very strong portrayal of a fierce, intelligent man, with his flaws, and his strength, and his relationship with his wife. Very good.The film starts in the period just leading up to the war, with Chamberlain getting the sack and the far more useful Churchill taking over in a national government. It ends with his losing the post-war election, the film does not extend into his final years."
2,A weak sequel,"Let me begin by saying that Brendan Gleeson's acting is one of the few things that saves what otherwise could have been a disastrous movie. For one thing, the story does a poor job of telling why Churchill was so instrumental to England's survival in WWII. The story is random and bouncing and really does a poor job of showing both Churchill's character and the events he lived in. The first film, ""The Gathering Storm,"" was told much better as it gave a firm view of Churchill and showed who he was and what he was trying to accomplish.While I do enjoy seeing Brendan Gleeson act, Albert Finney did a much better job of catching Churchill's often difficult and brilliant spirit. The rest of the cast, except of Churchill's wife Clementine were almost wall paper. The best role which went unexplored was Churchill's first encounter with Montgomery. That bit was brilliant but went unexplored.All in all, I found this very dull and a poor sequel to ""The Gathering Storm."""
5,Winston Churchill: A Man of Extraordinary Courage,"This movie is the best historical movie I've ever seen. This movie revealed in great depth the character of one of the most extraordinary men of the twentieth century. Through this movie I have seen that Winston Churchill was a man of extraordinary courage, perhaps the most courageous of the 20th century. I have also seen that he had the extraordinary ability to pass on courage to others through his words. This is a ""must watch"" for anyone interested in history and highly recommended for everyone else."
4,Not Bad,"This book really helped me with all of my auditions.There is a wide variety of skits to choose from.Whether you want the audience to laugh or be moved, this book has the scenes to make that happen."
4,Suspenseful entertainment,"""Sorry, Wrong Number"" has to be one of the most well-done suspense films to come along. Adapted by the writer of the famous radio play that starred Agnes Moorehead, Barbara Stanwyck brings to life the invalid socialite who overhears a telephone conversation that will send her into a panic for the rest of her bedridden evening. Burt Lancaster is well cast as her neer-do-well husband, whom we learn is not as devoted as he seems.The story is told in a series of flashbacks by various characters that Ms. Stanwyck encounters on the telephone, that one by one leads up to the shocking climax of the film. This film is perfect to watch with friends and family on a Saturday night with the lights off, to experience fear without the need for violence and gore. Filmmakers of today should take a lesson."
5,"""There's someone on the stairs!""","Leona (Barbara Stanwyck) is a rich invalid who is driving her husband (Burt Lancaster) crazy with her attempts to keep him dependent on her financially. When one night he doesn't come home, Leona attempts to call him. Picking up the receiver, she discovers the line in use. A moment of unintentional eavesdropping reveals a murder plot that Leona is helpless to prevent.For her performance, Stanwyck earned an Oscar nomination. The film is exquisitely directed by Anatole Litvak (the philandering husband of Miriam Hopkins). This is a classic example of film noir and the perfect date night movie. ""Sorry....wrong numba..."""
2,"Sorry, Wrong Number","The movie was OK because of the actors, but not that well written. The DVD itself was a bad copy...not sure if it was the DVD itself or the copy, had to throw it away. I would not recommend it and I love the actors."
3,Very good adaptation of an all-time classic radio play,"Barbara Stanwyck & Burt Lancaster do well in this cinematic version of the radio classic -- which was essentially a one-woman, one-act play with radio's all-time greatest female actress, Agnes Moorehead. It's sad that Moorehead didn't play the role in the film, but then again it's somewhat understandable, given that she was no movie star. Although the expansion material can get a bit too drawn out, this was an excellent noir film. Highly recommended -- almost as much as the radio play, if you can find it."
4,"Barbara is, as always, fantastic.","Barbara is not in this movie enough. That's why I gave it four stars. I also don't like Burt Lancaster, but you're not really supposed to. The plot is well known: woman hears murder plotted over telephone, could it be hers? Maybe. This movie is incredibly suspenseful, but I knew what was going to happen. I heard the radio version of the movie (with Burt and Barbara, not Agnes Moorehead). Amazingly enough, Barbara plays an invalid. An invalid that walks around. However, with flashbacks, you can see her, chipper and spoiled as always. Barbara starts to look rather disheveled as her character gets more and more frightened. It's quite effective. That and the fact that Barbara screams really well. This is a good movie, and I highly recommend it."
2,a convoluted mess,"did not like this movie,except for the acting which was it's only redeeming quality. this movie jumps all over the place and after a while i just gave up trying to follow it,although i did watch it to the end,hoping it would end up making sense.boy was i wrong.was never so happy to see end credits roll. i do not recommend this movie unless you are one of those people who can keep track of ten things at once.if you are,you'll love it.otherwise don't waste your time"
4,Good Movie -,"In this gripping thriller, Barbara Stanwyck stars as Leona Stevenson, a young, beautiful, rich hypochondriac who rarely gets out of bed. When she dials a wrong number by mistake, she accidentally overhears two men plotting a murder. As she tries to trace the source of the call she becomes convinced that her husband (Burt Lancaster) is the one plotting the murder, and that she's the target. Turns out she's right -"
1,A 200+ paged advertisement,"I thought I had encountered bad writing, but boy was I in for a shock when I opened this one. For the life of me I do not see what all the applause was about. I read somewhere that in order to succesfully write in first person you either have to be a genius or a mad-man, Grosvenor has proved she is neither one. The writing level was meant for someone in the fifth grade, who had no intentions upon going to the sixth grade. What was all the bolding about throughout the book. I don't need anyone to highlight Maxwell or Pepsi or Versace for me, to know that they are either celebrities or name brands. Not only was the writing juvenile but the description of the dialogue, i.e. he said. . . then I said. . .? What was that? And for it to be a Christian novel but for the writer to only start quoting scripture three quarters through the book. I don't understand the accolades she has gotten on this book, because she has clearly missed the mark."
3,Too contrived!,"When I first started reading this book I thought it was pretty interesting, however midway through it, I couldn't help but feel like this book was a little too contrived and that the main character was not a very realistic one. I stuck with it until the end and completed the book but it turned out to be unfulfilling and a waste of time."
4,This novel portrayed a sensitive topic in a profound manner.,"Having an affair with a married man is a situation many women, unfortunately find themselves involved in. Ms. Grosvenor took this topic and with much love and care, told a story that a lot of women wish would come true. I enjoyed reading this book and was very surprised by the ending. I liked how God played an important role in the main character's decisions. I have recommended this book to many people to show them that love, with God's help, will work out if it is meant to be."
3,The other side,"When I read this book I was looking for the reasons why some women get involved with a married man. I was also trying to understand why anyone would willingly try to break up a marriage. I realize we are not all saved. Some of the things we thought we would never do, we end up doing. I am pleased things worked out for the main character in the end. Nine times out of ten, in real life the man does not leave his wife. For that is how god intended for it to be. We have to be mindfull that the enemy is out to destroy families, not keep families together. I understand the author is trying to help heal those who have been in this situation. I wonder if any of these women stop to think about the effect an extra maritial affair has on the mans wife and children. This book proved to me we need to continually stay in prayer and always look to god, so we may be in his perfect will."
3,A good first try!,This book was a pretty easy read and I really did enjoy it. However I think the way it ended was a bit unrealistic and it almost seemed like the affair was condoned. Overall it was still good and I liked the way the author incorporated religion into the book and showed how Lea in the end put everything in god's hands. It truly was a fairytale ending but there was still a message in it that we can all get something from.
3,Thoughts,"I think Linda's first novel was OK, hopefully the second will be better. Dealing with married MEN the circumstances are always different but the situation is always the same, no matter how you look at it. THEY WILL NEVER LEAVE THEIR WIFES AND THEY CAN NOT BE TRUSTED!"
5,Finally!!!! A book everyone in a relationship should have.,"One of the most challenging occupations of today is being a Christian. This book illustrates what many people have or could be experiencing in the quest for their soul-mate. One of the best attributes to the story is that it teaches us not only to be a faithful to our mate, but faithful to the word of God. While reading this book the words, chracters and situations come to life. The story captures my imagination and becomes vivid. I could actually feel the pain, joy and spritual healing Aliyah experienced. The author has been blessed with an amazing ability to bring her stories to life. Were waiting for the next one..."
5,"Fabulous, a must read!!!!!!!","Sometimes I Cry is a powerful tale of loving, losing and finding oneself. It is a must read for every woman, young and old, Black and White.Linda is an excellent author who we will see in very high places soon. Not to be missed."
1,very disappointing,"This is the first terrible review that I have written, but this book deserves it. Seduction, betrayal, infidelity, adultery, and children born out of wedlock - I was quite disappointed that this book claimed to have a ""spiritual reconciliation."" I didn't like the main character, Aliyah at the beginning of the book and felt the same at the end of the book. The title for the book was crappy when it should have been ""I Cry Because I Feel Ashame."" If I could have given this book a rating of ""O"" for the number of stars, I would have. I will not this book to anyone. Let's hope the author's writing will improve with her next book."
4,NICE and COMPLEX!!!!!,"This is one of the best works, by a first-time author, that I have read in a long time (not since Sister Sister by Eric J. Dickey and Invisible Live by E. Lynn Harris)! Aaliyah is a very real character, and the situations that occur are extremely plausible. I also have her second novel, Like Boogie On Tuesday (but I'll review that one later). Kudos to Dominique!"
4,The author has a nice writing style,"This is Linda Grovesnor's first novel. As a person who plans to enter the industry, I am learning how difficult writing can be. So I applaud Linda for her efforts and for coming forth with a fresh and unique writing style. Mind you there are many grammatical errors in her book, but I have recently learned that those errors may be due to the typesetter's fault, and not necessarily the author's grammatical skills. Yeah, yeah, this is not a good excuse, but my point is, let's give the woman a pat on the back for publishing her first book. Applaud her for her efforts and let's look forward to the next book she has to offer. She does have a likeable and thought-provoking style and she is indeed a writer."
1,miserable joke of a watch,This watch is a joke! Do not buy it.The face is black with dark silver LCD numerals and no light of any kind.You cannot see it except in extreme bright light and then only at just exactly the right angle. Useless at night or even in average room light.I could only barely see the numbers when I held the watch DIRECTLY under a(like 2 inches away)60 watt light bulb.Sent it back the first day. What a waste.
4,Some back ground music gone??,This sound track is pretty good with 2 things that i will note and i hope some one will respond...the seen where joe pesci is talking about tonys dogs shooting the bar upwhere is that back ground music??if some one knows that could the please respond..and one of the last songs in the movie where every one starts to fallhouse of the rising sunthat song is not the same on the sound track it is a diffrent version..
3,"Good, But Missing Some Vital Tracks","While admittedly there are terrific songs on this soundtrack, the running order could have been organized better (even if Robbie Robertson did put this collection together). Many times I had to reprogram just to listen to it all the way through, something I didn't have to do with the short but sweet ""Goodfellas"" soundtrack. And where is Ray Charles's ""Stella By Starlight"" and Jerry Vale's ""Love Me The Way I Love You"", two very prominent songs in the movie! It's personal preference to be sure, but that's what this forum is all about, right?It's still an enjoyable soundtrack as all the other reviewers allude to.Peace."
4,Superb Soundtrack all the way through,"Martin Scorcese may have peaked a while ago with his movies, but his soundtracks are nothing short of fantastic.He always takes great care to ensure that the scenes in Casino are represented by the most appropriate tune available, and in this case, he was unable to obtain (probably due to money) any of the early stones tunes ('Can't You Hear Me Knockin', 'Gimme Shelter') for this album. That being said, every tune will remind you of the scene you saw it in. By doing so, they actually replace the dialogue at times.From Dean Martin, Otis Redding, Dinah Washington, Fleetwood Mac, etc., the list is star time all the way, and if nothing else, this is a great music sampler that will inspire people to pick up items from most of the individual artists."
1,Taqiyya Fest,"This is holy deception (Islamic Taqiyya).For the truth about Islam, read the books:Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out edited by Ibn WarraqWhy We Left Islam: Former Muslims Speak Out by Crimp and RichardsonJihad in the West by Paul FregosiUnderstanding Muhammad: A Psychobiography by Ali SinaThe Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam by Robert SpencerReligion of Peace? by David Gregory"
2,Are you a prog snob? This CD will test you!,"Do you prefer songs in 7/8? Do you love Steve Howe's guitar tone? Do you like your rock stars in pirate shirts? Are your favorite songs over 15-minutes long? Than this is the album to test your prog snob aptitude! Contained in this album you will find your favorite prog songs molded into Christmas carols! King Crimson, Zeppelin, Genesis and Kansas (is Kansas prog?)...just to name a few! I guess it's all great fun and shouldn't be taken too seriously. But damn it, prog rock is a serious business! We proggers are supposed to be miserable and hate others who can't appreciate our sophisticated music! Okay, I'm having a bit fun here but I can't help but think that this is a bit of a self-parody. I guess I am a prog snob because I just can't completely get in to it. But its all in good fun. But it does mane me cringe at times."
5,Absolutely Great,"If you are not a fan of classic rock (say Queen, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Yes, etc...) you may only find this a mediocre CD. I absolutely love this CD, it is great. The emulations of the bands are great, but they're not actually trying to ""copy"" the band... which is a good thing. There is not a song on there that I do not like, even if I didn't like the band emulated. I am very pleased, and I would highly highly recommend this CD if you like anything remotely similar to Classic Rock."
2,I can't stop my tears,"It irritated my eyes even though I didn't apply around the eyes. I can't stop my tears. I also feel a little itchy when it is on my face. But after I washed it out, I did feel my face become cleaner than before. But the cost is too much! My eyes can't open when it is on my face."
2,ehh..,This clay mask doesn't do anything for my skin. and also it has a funny smell. I don't recommend it.
4,Nice mask,"This is the first clay mask I've ever used, so I can't speak on comparing it to other masks on the market.It has a nice, somewhat strong scent, and is very creamy and goes on smooth. I did have some trouble keeping it from streaking, leaving the mask a bit thicker in some areas, but overall it went on fine.It tightens some while drying, but not uncomfortably. It burns and stings a little, nothing too bad, but I imagine more sensitive skin types wouldn't like it.It leaves my skin feeling soft, and after using it for a few weeks, I've noticed improvement in my skin's appearance overall: less pimple breakouts, less redness. It doesn't close up pores all that much, but it's slightly noticeable.Overall, I'd say it's a great buy for the price, but it's not a miracle-worker."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I never write reviews on anything, but I just had to for this! I got a trial size of the freeman avocado and oatmeal mask, just looking for something inexpensive to give me a little break during one of my late night study sessions. I can honestly say I wasn't expected to be so excited after using this! I always think the more expensive something is, the better, but I got such great results from this mask! I have dry, sensitive skin, and was worried that this would really dry out my skin even more. But after washing this mask off, I first noticed that it left my skin extremely soft and smooth. And after applying moisturizer like normal, I could feel that my skin was also really hydrated! I love this mask, and have now purchased the full size! I will be using once a week, and think it has been a great addition to my beauty regimen. And I have learned a lesson- not everything wonderful has to be top-of-the-line!"
5,Love This,"I love this product, this is my first time using a mask and I have to say I wish I knew about this sooner. I have been having problems with acne and dryness for the past 18 years. I brought expensive acne products that would help with one thing and create another. I tried this product 3 months ago, using 3 times a week nightly before I go to bed leaving it on. Next morning when I wash it off, my skin is so soft and refreshed looking. I also have not used my acne products since I started using this and I can say I have not had one single breakout or dryness of my face."
5,incredible,"A friend recommended this to me and I'm so glad as its one of the best books I've read this year.The story is so intertwined between the fiction and the reality its basically a great therapy and really got me thinking how my own story would be told in such a way.The story itself is an adventure that rivals the Twilight series and it addresses the serious issues that many children are facing today. Penn State is not the first professional organization (school) to have a child predator lurking its hallways and certainly won't be the last. This is nothing new, it is an ongoing problem. The Wolf is a healthy way to look at these interesting and challenging issues and for me made a most compelling book to read.Well recommended."
5,Groundbreaking subject for African American Writer,"Amanda Grihm takes you to the depths of intrique with her unique style of writing. Her characterization of the wolf takes you on the inside of this strong, ferocious animal. The visuals created by her descriptive prose is unmatched. She writes this animal from an intimate, internal stance that makes you wonder if she has, indeed, shapeshifted into a wolf.The image of a woman sitting on the edge of a cliff (front cover) is appropriate for this story as each turn of the pager is a cliffhanger! Sarissa's journey is one that I am sure each and every one of us has taken, though not in the form of a wolf, and one that each of us can learn from. This is a wonderful, exciting, uplifting story about a woman who finally learns to love herself enough to move on in life!I'd love to see this become a best seller and a movie."
1,"If I could give it less than one star, I would",I didn't like this book one bit. I couldn't suspend reality enough to buy ANY of it. What it needed more than anything was a proofreader! I found the spelling errors on every other page extremely distracting! It was a battle to even finish this book. I wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE.
2,doesn't hang together,"This short book is a memoir of about 2 years in the author's life, told in short vignettes. The style of writing and the translation are easy to read, but the story is hard to follow. The chapters are short and choppy and intervening events tend to be left out. For example, the first several chapters are all about how the author and her lover are so poor they can't afford food or wood to heat their apartment with. A few chapters later, however, they seem to have enough money to live without scrimping. It is quite unclear how this change in fortune came about. Similarly, in the latter chapters, a book is mentioned which is referred to as ""our book."" The book seems to be in the final stages of publication, but the reader has no idea what the book is about (although the contents seem to be subversive since they feel as though the Japanese police might show up to arrest them at any moment). All in all then, this is a sort of confusing read."
5,Cases in Consumer Behaviour - a helpful tool,"I'm a Consumer Behaviour teacher in a Marketing University in Portugal, and I had problems in finding texts to work with, about this subject.I usually used some magazines, but it's not easy to build special cases to study and to make some examples, to demonstrate the theory.I've already read this book, and I can garantee that it's a very helpful book. I adopted it for this year in IPAM (Marketing Administration Portuguese Institute).... the book is really good."
1,"NOT a ""Revolutionary""","R.U. Sirius has so little talent as a writer that it a miracle this piece of trash was ever published. But he has ""ways""--throw enough money at the publisher and they'll print it. Eve Berni is NOT a real editor---check for yourself. No talent and no brains.All through this book, one can vividly see that R.U. Sirius has a hyper-inflated ego. He throws out strings of profanities and calls it ""art"". I suppose this book would make a good soporific.R.U. seems incapable of coming up with an original thought. So much of the material in this book has been plagerized from other sources; it truly is disgusting.A huge disappointment for anyone seeking REAL counterculture literature."
3,Red Hot Reads,"The Man...Newspaperman Grey Masterson. He's responsible, conservative...and he's at the end of his rope! Only, little does he guess that when he and his brother, Zane, switch places, he's in for even more excitement....The Woman...Jewelry designer Reina Price. She's smart, she's sexy and she knows it. She uses her sensuality to keep her where she wants to be - in charge. Only, with her friend ""Zane"" she's suddenly lost her edge - and her control. And she's likeing it far too much....The Pleasure....After a sexy tell-all book by his former lover hits the stands, Grey Masterson discovers he's suddenly notorious. He's even acquired a stalker! ""Becoming"" his reckless, wild, identical tiwn brother , Zane, for awhile might be just the break Grey needs. Only, once he meets Zane's friend, sultry Reina Price, he discovers there's no rest for the wicked. Luckily, Grey's planning to be very bad...."
5,Fancifill Cake Pan,Used it the other day. Everyone was very impressed with the cake. It's a quality cake pan. I'm very satisfied.
1,Not available anymore,This wasn't available the last few times I tried to order it. My husband has since stopped drinking it.
2,"good, but not really coffee","I've almost finished one can, and while it is quite tasty, it tastes only remotely like coffee, if even that much. It is a bit sweet, which detracts from its taste for me as I did not add sweetener to my coffe when I drank it. All in all, though teeccino is quite tasty, I'm still looking for a real coffee substitute with a real coffee taste as I am convinced that the negatives of coffee outweigh the positives."
5,Teeccino IS coffee,"I know, it's not really but you can't really tell the difference. It's the best coffee that's not coffee I've ever tasted. I put 1/2 coffee and 1/2 Teeccino in my husband's blend - when I told him he wasn't drinking 100% coffee, he was amazed and said he didn't realize the change."
5,Very usefull,Exactly what I needed to help me out. I suggest for all collectors. You will not dissapointed with this book.
1,look elsewhere,"There is VERY little information here for the price, and the author focuses on lyposuction as the cure, which has been proven ineffective time and again. Not worth it."
1,Piece of garbage,"Well, this movie is pretty much a piece of crap, storyline is a joke, child actors are horrible, special effects suck, overall, it's a piece of crap. Don't buy this."
1,Save your time and money,"Poorly written, poorly developed characters, and has little to grab one's interest. It is certainly not a ""page turner"". In fact, there is nothing here to make one want to turn to the next page. Of course, I did. After all, I bought the book. Big mistake!"
5,The dawn of a new faith,"Set in the seventh century A.D. during the beginnings of Islam, KHALIFAH, John Elray's riveting historical novel of conquest and triumph is also a compelling fable of star-crossed love, clashing faith, and the rise and fall of empires. A powerful, fascinating story that encompasses ancient ways of life and the dawn of a new faith that will forever change the world, Khalifah is a superbly written, totally engaging novel from start to finish and enthusiastically recommended for personal reading lists and community library collections."
5,Dazzling tour de force!,"John Elray's vivid descriptions of people, places and pivotalevents are memorable.With masterful dexterity, he has embroidered strands of history,political intrigue, culture, religion and romance into a tapestrythat is totally riveting.A dazzling tour de force!"
5,You should know what you are looking it at,"If you are looking alto buy a holga you should what kind of camera it is, it limitations, and it's wonders. Just let me give you some tips on how to ""work your holga"" wrap black tape around the edges of the back cover to prevent light link and enjoy it.Just know developing 120mm can be a bit expensive"
2,the flash doesn't get the job done,Don't get this item unless you plan you plan on not using the flash or only plan on using it when you are 2 feet from the subject. I have wasted about a 10 pack of polaroid film and a couple rolls of b/w 120.
2,This Camera Amazing & Cheap,"This Camera is Amazing & Cheap. Just a few comments about its packaging, i love to see some improved package on this with some colorful booklet and manuals. The rest is fine, the camera itself, Holga delivers dreamy Lomo Image."
1,Terrible sound quality!,"This disc says ""newly remastered from the original anaolog tapes"" and but it's a lie! This disc is an exact copy of the heavily noise reduced and badly EQ'd ""First Light"" remaster that came out in the UK a few years ago! They even admitted that they used the UK CD as their source! In other words, if you already have that disc, you won't need this one. FaceTheMusic.com says this disc is different from the UK remaster but it's a BALD-FACED LIE! Sony, and everybody involved with this reissue, should be ashamed of themselves!"
3,White Basket.,"I purchased this tiem for my wife. The size was not listed, and I was surprised, that when it arrived ,it was only about 12 in square."
1,If you're looking for a clothes basket THIS IS NOT A CLOTHES BASKET,"I bought this under the pretenses that it was a clothes basket and the $8.00 price seemed fairly reasonable.Instead what I got is a piece of plastic that would normally have cost $2.00 at a local department store, so not only was it advertised somewhat misleadingly the price is also ridiculous.Don't buy this. Go somewhere else... go ANYWHERE else."
2,Not 6pack,"I also ordered the 6 pack and was surprised to find only 1 in the box! I needed them in my classroom to use as book bins. It was disappointing to not have the bins I needed for the first day of school. With that said, however, I bought some a few years ago and they are still holding strong in my classroom! Sterilite is great, it is the seller you need to do research on :-)"
4,"bigger than I thought, not to much though. OK manufacture here.",I used mine for medicinal types bottle storage for oragnaization. They are also sturdy when moving them about.Seems you may get the good I price I didn't expect too for a single one or many.
4,Assemblage Intro,"I thought this was a very useful introduction to Assemblage theory. Of course, as with all of De Landa's work, it is unapologetically Deleuzeian, evinced by copious footnotes citing Deleuze and Guattari at length. This is just an introduction, and I think the title is horrible, despite his explicit statements that he wants to open the debate for an ontology of sociology (personally I think the title evokes a New Age contingent). Finally, the book is written in essay form (intro, body, conclusion) and his conclusions really are recapitulations of statements already made in the body of the text, although, his conclusions seem rushed and truncated, as though he just wanted to get the book to print."
4,history by an aviator who was there,"This is a sound history of U.S. Navy night operations from the beginning to the present. Along the way, the reader picks up a lot of carrier lore that applies equally to day operations. What distinguishes this book from the usual Naval Institute Press study is that Mr. Brown was one of the aviators that he's writing about. Where he can, he gives first-person recollections, and throughout the book he relies heavily on interviews with fellow aviators."
3,Shocking Revelations Of On Going Government Waste!,"To some extent this book is a re-hash of old stories about government waste,however,many are new revelations.....You may be numbed to the waste in government....But I did find it very interesting.Worth a read.Paperback price makes it appealing as well."
5,My cat's name is Mittens,"If you like Simpsons, you will love Ralph Wiggum.So if you choo-choo-choose him you will enjoy looking at him."
5,NEW CIRCLES,"Amazing Grace Praise Band ""Glorious Triumph"": ""In the Bible, Psalms 150, Verse 4 says `Praise God with the stringed instruments and with dancing. And that's exactly what we plan to do ..."" That's the way the CD starts, and I'm tellin' ya, that's all she wrote, `cuz the band takes off from there. In the vein of Robert Randolph and the Family Band, this Toledo group rocks the house - or the church, as the case may be. Eric Russell is assured a place in heaven, by virtue of his steel-guitar playing alone, as is amply witnessed on the opening track ""Eric's Praise."" And it is the instrumental tracks that rock this disc - which is not to take away from Kelli Grace, Tressa Boles and the other vocalists on this homegrown production. Praise the steel guitar."
5,the best,This is my most favorite cookbook. I even bought one for both my mom and mother in law. I can't think of one thing made from this book that wasn't delicious and amazing. I love the pictures that accompany most of the recipes. Love also that the recipes are low calorie but you'd never know it.
5,Delicious Variety,"Having just graduated from college, I'm fairly inexperienced in the kitchen. Yet, thanks to this book, I have impressed not a few dinner guests (including my very picky parents) and am known for my biscotti. The recipes range from the traditional (Italian Meatloaf w/ Fresh Basil and Provolone) to the deliciously unique (Seafood Lasagna) and everything in between with a relatively healthy spin. And, as a novice, I enjoy the many glossy pictures (they assure me my creations are not total flops). Even my whisk-warrior of a mother has copied some of ""my"" recipes. She's getting her own copy for Christmas."
5,Will order again!!,"Book arrived, on time, and in near new condition...Will order again...Thank you for the great book and prompt service."
3,Cute but Trite,"The book was fine. I read it in about an hour and a half and had some laugh out loud moments. However, I thought it was filled with predictible characters- like it was written to be a screenplay of a Lifetime movie. We'll see if M. Guterson can follow up with another book and if it just more of the same or if she can go deeper with more compelling charcters. I also think the font and large margins were trying to make a novella into a novel."
2,Just OK,"This was a ""just OK"" book. It was readable, but very short and didn't delve into the characters as much as I would have hoped. I would borrow it or buy it used. It's not that great."
3,Has anyone else.......,"Has anyone else noticed how this book's cover is almost IDENTICAL to ""Savannah Comes Undone""?Savannah Comes Undone (Savannah)Very odd indeed."
2,Slim & grim.,"I bought this book based on the blurb on the inside cover and while it does follow the story line there I found the writing lacking something, specifically dialogue. Most of this novella takes place inside the confused mind of Julia, a married woman who discovers she's pregnant shortly after a tryst with her boyfriend from long ago. Since she also had sex with her husband (apparently, an usual occurrence) she is not sure who the father of the child is. She tells both men and while her husband, although initially not happy about the idea, slowly comes around to being a father for the second time (their son is a teenager) her lover doesn't seem to care much so she continues her deception with her husband. I enjoyed the author's musings but didn't enjoy the way she flippantly treated cuckolding her husband and found the ending trite."
3,we all face hardships,"This book made me think, cry and laugh--all qualities that make a good novel. But it was lacking a certain something in its dark humor. It seemed like a discarded plot from ""Desperate Housewives"" that packed a bit of an emotional punch at the end. I'd be interested in seeing what else Guterson writes, but I won't be waiting in line for an early edition."
2,art instructor,"Not acceptable medium for middle school. Thought I had ordered scratch board. My bad, thought that price of product was too high."
5,"Not really a toy, but very good display piece",I bought all the pieces in this collection. They are really good quality an now that the show is over I am glad I bought them.
4,"not my fave, but pretty good","In this book, Jeremy is faced with a tough decision. His family is moving to Arizona, and he must decide whether he wants to finish his senior year at Big Mesa with all his friends and Jessica, or if he wants to stay loyal to his family and move with them. His parents leave the choice up to him, and what he decides surprised me. Ken gets offered a scholorship to Michigan, but Will find out that something fishy is going on between Ken's dad and the Michigan scout. Read to see if Ken does get the scholorship, and what Will decided to do. Alanna is having a hard time staying on the wagon, and feels nobody loves her. Read the book to find out what happens between Conner and Alanna. Tia and Andy are hardly mentioned in this book, and I hate that. We also don't really hear anything from Elizabeth either. This book is good though, and I reccomend it. It's not my favorite, but it does have some surprises with Jessica and Jeremy. Happy Reading!!"
1,"ridiculous, actually","Stohl has very little to add to his computer's analysis--and if that were not already unforgiveable in a chess author, his lack of judgment in the lines he evaluates and includes, too many of which are entirely irrelevant to the themes and motiffs the players are exploring, completes the assessment. I am rated > 2400, and find analysis like this, UNLESS I CONDUCT IT MY SELF, next to useless: it is unlikely that a person can learn mathematics by watching someone else add.Stohl's two volumes on Kasparov is better, but let's face it, Stohl is not a great chess player, and he is not a great author. He is, as Davies has complained more generally, one of the ""organization men"" of the chess world, not really needed, but wanting any other form of life, compelled to impose themselves where they would most like to fit.I rate it one star, but it perhaps deserves two--if I were grading it as a doctoral thesis on the unimportant.tlt -"
1,Heavy Duty? ... usual plastic bat,"Not really ""Heavy Duty"" - usual wiffle ball bat. Should last one year before needing to be replaced. Screwball bat much better selection."
2,Rootless - Rotten Wood For Smoking Bees,"Well, for calling themselves Rootless, they seem to display plenty of roots here, mostly on the party hip-hop side. But lack of roots isn't the major issue with ROTTEN WOOD FOR SMOKING BEES. Despite the fun, sunny vibe of ""Savannah"" or the blissful beats on ""There's Music in My Mind,"" the album as a whole seems to lack much drive. The tracks are content to wander on in repetition, without any further development. Similarly, the tracks are awfully similar to each other -- there's not enough internal variation, despite valiant attempts, like the dub of ""Forty Four Dub"" or the pseudo-Skinny Puppy lyrics of ""Gas"" or even the quasi-African ethnics on ""Mystical Purposes."" Though there's no doubting the funkyness of the bass or the beats, I'm afraid that the loops just don't do enough. They end up just being dull."
5,swanson strikes again,"I have taken arginine from countless brands and swanson's arginine seems to be just as potent as any other. it's a free form amino acid and nothing else so there is no real way for it to be less strong than NOW or gnc or any other brand. it's definitely a safe supplement to take in correct dosages. i'm surprised to see anyone on here saying its not safe...i would like to see the research on that. if taken in combination with other circulatory supplements (i.e. gotu kola, citrulline, etc.), the effects are even more pronounced."
2,Questionable Potency,"I have used the NOW brand and results were noticeable. Thought I would save money and use the Swanson, but it has little or no effect even taking high doses - 2Grams 4x day."
