1,I'm forced to give one star,What a goof !!!!!!!!! I can't believe someone could come up with this kinda crap. This book won't tell you how to get rich.....but it will definetely provide you with a lot of information about how to become a bragger.
3,What could have been,"Trump's book is another marketing vehicle for the Apprentice. It gives no advice on how to make money. The material is weak, however if you want to learn how to boast this book is it. I gave it three stars because is does talk about business management, but that's not the title of the book."
1,Trump HOW TO GET RICH!!,"This book sucks! All he does is brag. Who cares about how nice a guy REGIS IS!!!! 2/3 bragging rights. 1/3 content~!!! What the hell are we paying for! BRAG BRAG, pages of buildings and ex- wifes!! who someone else is on top of now!!!!DON'T BUY THIS BOOK IT SUCKS!!!!! NOT WORTH THE MONEY!DONALD TRUMP!! I have two words for you. No three!YOU'RE FIRED CHUMP!!!!!"
1,Recipe of Spicy Sesame Linguine seems to have changed for worse & Price gone up by more than 50%,"We have been ordering Spicy Sesame Linguine for the past 2-3 years as this was our favorite pasta! However, we recently realized that the taste of this linguine has lost its sesame flavor completely. The pasta now looks very different in color and texture and from our experience has now become completely tasteless.Moreover, the price of this pasta has increased from around $13.71 in 2010 (via Subscribe & Save) to $20.30 in July 2011, hence the price has ramped up MORE than 50%!What a pity the manufacturer of this pasta seem to have changed the recipe for worse. We were so disappointed that we even sent a complaint note on Amazon, who informed us that they have informed our disappointment to Al Dente. We hope that Al dente will make this pasta as delicious as it once used to be. Thank you."
3,Disappointed - need to hand stitch after one wash,Other than the crotch and left seem coming apart in the first wahs they are what I expected. I had to hand stitch both seems - about 2 inches on the left and a one inch opening in the crotch
4,yo KUFO,"Rock101 KUFO is my favorite radio station and they keep talking about this band playing at that rockfest thing that happened around july, so i decided to try these craving theo guys out. they've got great riffs and rythym but the vocals aren't all that good.on the the upside, they're from portland, OR, which is where i live and almost no bands emerge from Oregon. these guys are pretty good, but i think it would be a better investment to wait to hear 'em on KUFO."
5,Good for all kinds of ailments,"Initially I bought this oil for my own respiratory allergies. I was getting sinus infections and then I picked up whatever viruses were around. I haven't had a cold or flu since starting this oil. I take a tsp morning and night, in a little warm water with cinnamon and a little (1/2 tsp) honey. It worked on my dog's allergies, which I'd been paying vet bills to try and solve for 2 years!"
3,I can't feel a difference,There have been many positive reviews about this product however I've been through a whole 16 oz bottle and I don't feel anything from it. Not sure if it's working or not. I know some people like to mix it water and honey but for me to cut to the chase I drink it straight follow by a couple swig of water. So once again I don't feel anything difference from adding this to my diet.
3,taste is spicy ...,Makes you burp all day long but it has lots of great benefits .. I don't drink it every day because of that. But if it helps the stomach why not.
3,"Good, pricy and questionable quality","Seems good, a little watered down, there are others from other countries that are more real and of better quality, seems watered down some and a little pricy."
3,Horrible tast,"This oil has a horrible taste even when mixed with fruit juices. Used topically, I can't tell the difference between using this or any other oil.It does not do wonders for the skin like olive oil. We applied it to eczema as many were raving how good it was for this issue, but we saw no faster or better improvement that using Aveeno (for example)Can't vouch for the health benefits touted all over the internet. Recent research says it is beneficial treating pancreatic cancer cells, but thankfully, I have nothing that drastic to establish a comparison. I have been using the oil for 2 weeks topically and internally and don't have anything amazing to report.I gave it 3 stars because it arrived in good condition and because giving it a lower rating would be unfair. Perhaps the seeds are a better decision since black seed oil is a new thing, while black seeds have been consumed for centuries."
2,little to no detail,"We drove from San Jose, to Arenal, to Punta Islita, to Tamarido, to Liberia. I bought this map as well as the Waterproof Travel Map of Costa Rica, based on reviews I read that each gave important/different type of info and both would be useful. I ended up using the Waterproof Travel Map of Costa Rica about 99% of the time - it does an excellent job of detail on roads/landmarks/hotels/restaurants, and is for the most part up-to-date. This Globetrotter map however lacks in significant, updated detail. I would have been disappointed to have only had this map. The only 1% of the time that it was useful was that it labeled the bridge onto the Nicoya Peninsula as the 'Bridge of Friendship' (this actually wasn't labeled on the other map) and we looked forward to crossing it the entire trip (we were traveling with friends).Now that I've told you about the Bridge of Friendship...skip this map."
4,"By Bus, not driving",We took busses and planes while in Costa Rica. This was a good map for planning our itenerary and making final decisions. You still need to converse with locals and bus schedules etc while there. taxi drivers were good sources as well.Look for a better map of San Jose if you plan to stay more than a couple of days. Lots to see there if you want. We rode the busses all over and the drivers were good at dropping you at odd places or picking you up if you flagged them down.
4,Really good Costa Rica Map,This map is very large and as such has a lot of detail on it. The map is well marked and very easy to read. It does not have as many tourist location marks on it (i.e. where things you want to see are located). For that I recommend the Insight FlexiMap. I would recommend getting both maps: one map for details and one for specific locations.
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed with this album. This is absolutely not 'The Meilleur' of Renaud
5,Very Nice Miter Saw; Excellent Laser System,"Excellent saw. The digital readout is convenient and very accurate to the 1/2 degree. The Hitachi laser is better than any other out there in that it can be used WITHOUT the blade spinning. This allows you to safely line up your work before pulling the trigger. The bevel and angle adjustments are smooth and accurate. The quality of the materials are unmatched. And of course the most important part, the saw is powerful and true.I'm very pleased."
4,Easy to use right out of the box,"I must admit I was concerned about the condition the saw would arrive in based on some of the reviews I read and the bad rating the packaging got but it did arrive in perfect condition in spite of the packaging. The saw cut perfectly right out of the box. I did have to adjust the laser which was very easy, in fact the hardest part was the binder for the tilt angle until I realized it was a left handed thread. The blade that was supplied is good for framing lumber but that's all. To cut trim the blade has to be replaced. If it had a good blade I would have given one more star. If you like gadgets like lasers and digital and don't mind spending a few extra dollars then this is the saw for you. It appears to be well built and accurate. As for the longevity only time will tell."
4,Just what I was looking for!,"I ordered this saw as a gift for my husband, He was really happy with the condition it arrived in and also the order was here in less than a week. He is really pleased with the laser on the saw and as of 3 months, he has no problems or complaints. He is a woodworker, and has made many of our own and our childrens furniture in our homes. One question, if some one could reply and let us know, We were to receive a free brad nailer with our purchase, and have not yet gotten it. It has been 12 weeks. Did any one else buy at this same time and also send for the free nailer? we sure would like to know the time line on the free gift. Thank you. Gloria Montgomery. Pennsylvania"
5,Awesome instructional chess book for beginners,My sister Amy and I have been using this book for a year. We both think it's the coolest chess book. I know about chess a little so I enjoy the cool puzzle part. My sister is new so she enjoys the piece introduction part and checkmate in 1.
3,Good book for beginners,"This book is really for beginners only. For intermediate chess players, another book by the same author ""chess tactics for champions"" is a better choice."
4,Good Second Book as it isn't really a smiple book to learn from scratch,"If you have already finished reading a good introductory beginners book (I like: Learn Chess: A complete Course for example for an adult or teenage reader) and are ready to move on, then Polgar's ""A World Champions Guilde to Chess: Step-by-step..."" makes for a good book. It gives you some interesting techniques to make you a better player and understand important ideas that will help you play better.I therefore recommend this book for and adult or teenage level reader that is just past learning the very basics."
3,Good if you know some basics - Not a starters book,"The problem is clear, the good points are clear! If you are just learning how to play (maybe don't know how the pieces move, or do, but don't understand much else) then you will find this book move along too quickly. Have an understanding of the basics, want an additional primer, then you will want some tips on how to play winning chess. Catchy title, but this book is a big general with some useful information for a just past the beginning stage player. If you are an absolute beginner this isn't the book (consder ""Learn Chess"", by Alexander and Beach for an adult beginner, ""Chess: a complete guide for the Beginner"" for an under age 16 beginner). What the title doesn't make clear is it's intended audience - a well advanced beginner!"
5,Nice!!,"Just what I was hoping for when I bought it. The ability to monitor the temperature accurately while it's in the oven--without having to open the door all of the time. Purchsed for prime-rib, used for a variety of other items. :)"
5,Simply the Best,My husband is the grill master and insists on an accurate temperature reading for meats. We have tried several brands and this one is simply the best. It lasts longer and is consistently accurate.
1,Works until it breaks,"We've had 2 of these in the last 4 years. They work, but break. First, the hinge breaks so the readout flops around. I hot glue them, which works rather poorly - a month or so. Then we prop the whole thing up at an angle so we can see it.Next, the clear plastic cover for the display pops off, which at first can be popped back on, but eventually won't stay on.Eventually, the display becomes intermittent, or flashes randomly, then won't display.Looking for a decent replacement presently."
4,Like It!,I have the confidence to make a great dinner now that I know the temperature of the meat. I love that the dial is outside the oven. It's so readable and easy to use. I previously overcooked meat/chicken to my husband's great disappointment.
3,polder original cooking thermometer,"Thermometer works well, but I wish it had an on/off switch rather than having to remove the batteries after each use. Still worth the money for low priced digital themometer"
2,"Cable breaks, replacement pricey","It worked for a number of months, and then it just stopped. Why? Because the shielded wire broke due to use in the oven. The design should have considered its use in the oven and the shield (which should have been like a mail) should have accounted for that. But, no: cheap engineering.Yes, you can order replacements, pretty much at the same price as a new one! Don't be fooled by the removable feature that gives you the impression that you can cheaply fix it. You can't, but instead buy a new one."
1,Broke after a few uses,"Bummer. The last Polder Thermometer I ordered from Amazon worked very very well for about a year, and then it broke. I was so pleased with the year's performance that I was willing to purchase another, figuring it was worth it if it could get me through the summer BBQ season. Wrong! This Polder(same model)never even made it to Memorial Day. I think I used it about 3 times before it broke. I tried diff't batteries, diff't cords, but no luck. What a waste!"
4,Great product at a nice price,"I really enjoy using this thermometer. I especially like the long cord to the probe which allows me to leave it sit on the counter as I work on other things. A quick glance over in the direction of the stove keeps me updated on where the meat is in its cycle. Also, I'm a big fan of the magnet on the back because I can keep this on the refrigerator and always have it at hand."
3,so far so good...but no On/Off,"After the second same style Taylor thermometer cable went out in a year, I decided to try the Polder. Much better assembled than the Taylor (for the same price). The cable to the probe seems better quality also...but only time will tell. The previous Taylor ones (silicon coated) shorted after regular use, in about a year or less, even with careful washing. My only complaint so far is the Polder unit does not have an ON/OFF switch, so it remains to be seen if the battery life will be acceptable."
1,"Trust the pros, Polder is crap","My Polder lasted through three roasts. Failed to read correctly on the 4th. When knew it had failed when a boneless leg of lamb showed 110 degrees on the Polder and the 145 degree heat thingie on the lamb popped out. Later I tried the Polder in a pot of boiling water. It read 194 when the water began to boil at 212, and it never read higher than 206.Junk, just junk. Cook mag missed badly on this one."
1,Not for the Grill!,"I ordered the similar Polder Classic thermometer/timer (the same unit as this except for the color) based on the strength of the positive reviews. It is an excellent timer, functionally very easy and intuitive to use. I even checked the accuracy of the temperature probe prior to use, and it was very good (read 32 degrees exactly; boiling was 2 degrees low--really quite good for an inexpensive device!) However, despite being very careful about routing the temperature probe cord away from the grill grates and up/away from the flames, the probe immediately died when I tried to use it on some thick steaks. I assume the heat (550 degrees inside the grill) was too much for it. I don't know how others got it to work (some did, some did not)--perhaps it is poor quality control, and some probes are OK, but this one is going back...."
1,Disappointing,"After seeing so many wonderful reviews,I ordered one of these to use for my Christmas turkey. The length of the cord was a bit shorter than I would have liked. It was long enough at my father-in-law's, but wouldn't have reached anything I could attach the magnet too at my own home. I put the probe in the turkey, closed the oven door and everything seemed fine... for about 5 minutes. The alarm started screaming and the unit said the turkey was over 200 degrees. I checked the positioning of the probe and made sure the wire wasn't hitting anything and closed the oven again. This time, it took two minutes. I tried once more and then pulled out the probe and checked the temperature of my palm. Again, over 200. I don't know if I just got a dud, but I won't buy another."
1,Total Crap,"Right out of the box it was defective. Said that my roast was 380 degrees when I pulled it out of the fridge. Tested in on a cooked roast, said that the temperature was too high to measure at ver 450 degrees. Riiiiiiiight.Utter piece of garbage, this product."
1,Thought I Really Had Something,"When I purchased this timer, I thought I had something good. I believe that I have had it for less than six months and I have used it only once. Today, I attempt to use it and the temperature that it is reading is 365 degrees. This is as it is sitting in the air. Now I have not stuck it in an oven. I use it to measure the temperature of milk that I am heating for cheese making so it has never been taken to any extreme temperature. And, as I say, I have only used it once. But if it cannot detect the temperature then it is of no value to me. I don't even know where to begin to get support for it. I hate it when a plan does not stay together."
1,Temperature Cooking Doesn't Work!!!!,"Like many reviewers before me,,, after a few uses the temperature readout stopped working and aways reads LO..."
3,Not having an on/off switch makes me nervous,"Just got this and it works fine, but I was surprised to see it has no on/off switch. Other people are saying the battery lasts a long time anyway, hope that's true."
2,Worked great...,...Then the thing melted. It was just sitting on the counter next to the stove and I was using the burner closest to it (several inches away) when I noticed it was melting. At least the turkey was already done.
1,Didn't work out of the box,"Bought this for my husband for his birthday. He took it out of the box and it doesn't work. We will send it back, but of course that will cost us extra. Obviously, I can't recommend this product."
3,I don't like it BECAUSE!! NOT WHAT I THOUGHT!,It say ~All-In-One Timer/Thermometer!~ I thought is was a thermometer for everything! When I got it which was great delivery time!! THE NEXT DAY! But I was looking for candy and all themometer. And I don't think that this would work good for candy. Maybe I'm reading it wrong but I think its for meat. I had it at 2 stars but changed it because they shipped it really fast and because I'm not so sure about it! I am going to try it for candy!! Then I'll really see!
2,"Great Timer, Crappy Probe","I got this for Christmas this past year, and I love it! It takes all the guess work out of roasting meats rare, medium, etc. We used it Christmas night for the roast beast! What I do no love is the shoddy probe. I am now ordering my second replacement probe. The first one went crazy after about 6 months, said everything was 69 degrees. The replacement lasted about 3 months, and now says my kitchen (never mind when I put it IN the meat) is 298 degrees. I love the timer because it is great, but replacing probes every few months is getting OLD!"
1,disgusted,"gave this to my wife for christmas... here I am now, 5 months later and guess what? did you know that a glass of icewater (1/2 ice, 1/2 cold water, sitting on the counter for 5 minutes or so) reads in as 120+ degrees!!! (what are we taking readings in Kelvin now? even that doesn't work though)after only 4 uses, it now reads 90-something degrees too HIGH. warranty dead, probe worthless, only part that still works is the timer.in summary: AVOID POLDER"
3,No sense for sensor.,"I had a thermometer/timer just like this that I loved. When it finally gave out, I wanted another one. This one doesn't work...period. The timer is fine, but the probe doesn't work at all. I'm bummed, because when it does work this is a great product. Obviously, I won't buy another one."
2,"loved, until it stopped working","This thermometer is a great idea, and I really loved it until it just quit reading temp correctly after about a year of (fairly infrequent) use. It's a cheap piece of you know what, made in China, and like so many products made in China, designed to self destruct. Like others here, I'm back looking for a replacement. If this had worked faithfully, though, because of the design, the built in timer, and the magnetic feature, it would have been a real winner. But sorry, cannot recommend."
1,didn't last,"I owned this for less than one year and now it stopped working, everytime when i connect the probe, it will read ""Hi"" temp. not interested in buying another probe since i don't know if the probe is not working or the thermometer is broken. Mom bought a cheapie one at lowes and cheaper than amazon and it's still working fine!"
3,Good one,"This is an inexpensive, solid thermometer. But don't buy this if you're wanting to use it in a smoker (such as the Big Green Egg). The instructions specifically state that you should never use it in a smoker. Just fyi. Works great in an oven, though."
1,"Fool me twice, shame on me","I've owned two of these Polder thermometers. Both times they've started out working fine, but within a year, they begin to provide erratic readings. It figures that even Cook's Illustrated could only give a ""recommended with reservations"" rating to this model and its identical Taylor brand counterpart.(I also didn't like that the timer could only be adjusted in one-minute increments, so I still have to rely on my microwave's timer.)I'd be happy to pay more for a more durable, more reliable probe thermometer -- still looking!"
3,not for barbque,I understand from reading the literature that came with the product that the probe is rated for no more than 362 degrees. Higher temps. can burn it out. This makes the product of little use with my gas grill since I often grill in the 400-450 range. I fortunately have a high temp. probe that seems to work with the product.
3,No on/off switch!,I've used this thermometer a few times and it works fine. The only thing that is strange is that there is no on/off switch! I have to take the battery out to shut it off. Polder should consider adding such a basic function to their next remodel.
2,There is no ON/OFF switch!,"Polder model 362-90 Digital In-Oven Thermometer/Timer does not have an OFF/ON switch!Polder Original Cooking All-In-One Timer/ThermometerThat is stated in the included instructions: UNIT DOES NOT HAVE AN ON/OFF FUNCTIONPerhaps it uses so little battery power that it will operate for a long time without being turned off? But I just opened the package so I cannot confirm that.ThermoWorks Model TW362B is very similar, but with an ON/OFF switch, has generally larger buttons, and folds flatter for storage. ThermoWorks The Original Cooking Thermometer/Timer NEW AND IMPROVED"
3,"Excellent, when it works","I've already gone through two of these timers. When they work, they're indispensable - it's so nice to be able to walk away from the oven, knowing that the timer will alert you when your baked goods have reached the proper temperature. Very handy. However, I've found that these just stop working after about a year. I've changed the batteries, etc., but they just stop working after a while. I'm going to try a different brand."
4,Great for smokin',"Thermometer works out perfect for smoking meat, you can place it in the meat and re-close the lid so that you do not lose temperature. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the fact that you can't shut it off."
1,poor quality,"I ordered this for Thanksgiving. I unpacked it for use and the probe already didn't work... my king of a husband quickly went to the market and got me a Kitchenaid digital thermometer which worked right away, and still does. Won't buy Polder again."
3,Didn't last.,"I've loved my little Polder for the last couple of years but it recently stopped reading out an accurate temperature. At room temperature, the probe says it is about 300 degrees. With no way to calibrate, it is a bit disappointing to throw the probe part away; however, the timer still works just fine. The sad part is, I have no idea what happened to it. It has never been abused, the probe (old, mesh-style) was never even left in the oven or exposed to flames or high heat. I've given it 3/5 stars because it did last at least 5 years and the timer still works fine."
5,Best Thermometer/timer I've used,"I've been using this for at least 10 years and I love it. It's only on it's second set of batteries and it's used almost every day. I haven't had any of the problems with the probe that I've read about and that also gets used frequently--probably at least once a week.I'm particularly impressed with the fact that it's been left out in the rain several times while attached to the smoker, gotten full of water and as soon as it's dried out it's been as good as new. It's hard to read when the display is full of water.....This is a terrific value for the money. I bought a back up several years ago thinking my original one must be close to reaching the end of it's useful life, but it's still in the box."
3,Is fantastic until it meets it's untimely end,"I've had this exactly one year, and it died on me. Used at least 2-3 dozen times and is a great asset in the kitchen, but I am sorely disappointed that it died after only one year. I expected more from Polder, and am thinking twice about purchasing another, as I don't want to have to replace this every year. Great design and works fantastic until it dies, but dies young."
1,Great until broke after 7 months,"I loved this thermometer until it broke after 7 months of use. I used it only a handful of times and cared for it well, making sure not to get water anywhere it shouldn't be."
2,didin't last long,"i cook constantly, i used this probably weekly on average for about six months, tonight it gave out a high-pitched squeak and went blank, so in the trash it goes. while it lived, it worked reasonably well, although the LCD display always gave me problems. i liked that you can set a max temperature and an alarm went off when the temperature was reached, saved me from setting the stove timer and then constantly checking the temperature of the meat. and, having read many of the reviews of this product on amazon, i was extremely careful to wash the probe only and usually just the tip, ensuring no water ever got into the cord or the device. i will not buy polder brand again."
2,Cable Problems,I have used Polder Thermometers for years. Bought 2 new ones in 2009 and they came with the new plastic covered cables. This cable is just plain junk. Now I am stuck with 2 thermometers with defective cables. Do not buy one unless it has the older woven steel cover.
1,It didn't work -sending back,Out of the Box it read 117 for a roast that was room temperature. Within 15 minutes it said the roast was done. It was still almost raw. Going to return and try another brand.
2,broke,"It broke promptly. Actually, the lead/thermocouple unit broke promptly. I didn't slam the lead with the barbecue lid or anything. I was quite careful. It broke. I'd happily spend 5 times as much for something that didn't break so easily.It was great while it worked though.sigh"
2,Polder cooking timer and Thermometer,"Didn't last long, about six times in my oven before it died out and gave wrong tempetures. It was not battery problem."
4,Good Product,"This product works great as both a timer and a thermometer. Other than not having an ""off"" feature so you have to remove the battery when you are done using it, it's a great tool to have in the kitchen."
4,Great Product,"I bought one of these on a trip, I used it for a few years, it still works, but it's getting on and I thought I'd buy a new one. These are really nice. I use them all the time. The new one I have a gripe about, the cord on the probe is plastic coated, my old probe is a metal mesh (?), heat proof. Other than that, I like items that make my cooking easier and successful."
4,"Good timer/thermometer, not for all applications","Overall I like this thermometer/timer; the display is large and tilts, it has magnets to stick to the stove, oven, or microwave, and the buzzer is loud enough to let me know things are done when I'm outside or in the basement. Even though I've only had it for less than a year, I've had to replace the probe because the cable melted when it touched the metal handle on my toaster oven. The instructions say that you should not leave the probe in the over with a temp over 400, but be especially careful where the probe leaves the oven. If they offered it, I would definitely pay for some type of probe with a flexible metal sheathing so it could stand the metal door handle and heat over 400 degrees."
2,"Junk, waste of money","Bought one of these, the probe must have died after a couple of usages, because it stopped displaying temperature and just displays ""H"". This thing is far too complicated and not user friendly at all, save your money. I give it two stars because at least when it worked, it was convenient because of the alarm setting."
3,Shows a metal probe wire... comes as plastic,"worked great, until the second time I used it and the probe wire melted on my BBQ. My own fault for not being more careful with the wire placement, but my metal jacketed thermometer probes have never melted.Other than that, it seems ok, too bad the probes are 50% of the cost of the unit.Seemed to work well other than that, accurate temp and fast updates."
4,Possible fix,"Have had the Polder thermometer for over a year, has worked great [for the most part]. I have had two separate occasions where at room temp the thermometer reads way out of whack (120 - 160F).This is far from scientific, but I think it has to do with moisture in the probe somewhere. Both times I threw the probe (not jack end) into a 400 deg oven for a few minutes, removed the probe and did a ice water/boiling water check, 32 degrees and 213 F. Not bad. Maybe some can rejuvenate their probes by hot air drying in the oven. Not a guarantee but worth a try if yours has failed."
3,"Nice, simple product","Nice produt...works well, easy to use. Wish it felt a little more ""solid"" in construction and that it had an ""off"" button. It's a bit annoying that you can't turn off the screen without taking out the battery. Other than that no complaints. Works as advertized."
1,Pathetic,"Bought this on sale, and glad I didn't pay full price. I used a few times and the metal cable burned nearly through (so now it's hanging by a few threads). After a few uses it stopped beeping, so now I need to run over every few minutes to check if food has reached proper temp. Also, it's not that easy to set the temp buttons. I'll stick with my digital instant-read one."
1,All polder thermometeres are horrible,"ive had 2 different models and both have gone though 2 probes each..thats 4 probes...Im done. Im going to a different brand. In doing some research, ive come to find that this is a common issue with all models. Id rather they just charge me [...] bucks and give me life time probe replacements. Regardless, this is not a reliable product. Nothing like puttin your turkey in the oven on thanksgiving and realizing you need a new probe."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this item as gift for my son because I have another model of Polder thermometer that I like. The gift I purchased does not have on-off switch, you must remove battery to turn off. Makes no sense!"
1,Short lived,"Used twice, broke on 3rd time. Advertised for use on the grill but warranty fine print says not to use over an open flame. Seems a bit contradictory."
1,Only used it twice...,"The first time I used it, it was fine. The second time, when the probe was unplugged it read the temp as ""lo"". When the probe was plugged in, it read ""hi"" and beeped continually. The probe tip was not inserted into anything to be reading a temperature! I'll try a replacement and let you know how that works. Good think I didn't wait too long to try it!"
3,"Nice Timer, but Engineers Missed the Boat","This timer is simple, straightforward, and works great. The problem is that there is no on/off switch, and when mine arrived, the magnets fell off because the adhesive was not working anymore."
3,"Competently Done, But Still","This book landed in my basket because of The Book of Night with Moon and its sequel. When I started it, I thought, ""Now, I have read about these characters before, haven't I?"" And yep, I had. I didn't remember them off-hand, though things came back.The trouble is, this book is going to slip my mind by next week.This is competently done, decently plotted, and the characters are both fairly likeable and fairly interesting. But these guys are interchangeable with any other group of characters from any number of novels.That nest of adverbial phrases covers it. My feeling about this is ambiguous. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book. But it's a good thing that it's in paperback, or I'd be feeling cheated right now, and probably annoyed.Feel free to buy it. It will give you a couple pleasant hours, but you won't add to your already over-flowing bookshelves."
3,Not For Australia,"Purchased ice cream maker on line delivery was super fast, however the US model ice cream maker does not fit the Australian delivered Kitchaid. The Australian model has a metal ring on the main shaft drive which does not allow the ice cream attachment to couple. You can purchase the correct unit from Kitchenaid in Australia for $80 approx. However we contacted kitchaid via an online forum and the correct beater unit is being shipped to us at no expense by Kitchenaid direct. The marketing for the ice cream attachment says fits all models and thats the angle we used. A very helpful company"
2,Icecream Maker not for the Australian market,This was the first time that I have bought something through Amazon and I was pleased to recieve the Kitchen Aid Icream maker in the time stated. Unfortunately it was not compatable with the Australian design Kitchen Aid stand mixer. It is a pitty that Kitchen Aid has not made it clear that this could be a problem. The replacement parts in Australia cost $130 Au delivered. I ended up buying the local product at twice the price of the US version! Research after the event has shown that other people in Australia have fallen into the same trap. Buyer beware!
4,KitchenAid Ice Cream maker,"My family really likes that I purchased this ice cream maker. So much, in fact, I have purchased 3 more for family members."
2,"Useful - yes, durable - no","When we first purchased this in Spring of 2007, we were excited and very pleased with the ice cream we were able to make with it. We bought an Ice Cream Recipe book from Ben & Jerry and had numerous(10 or so)successes making our own ice cream.We put the unit under our counter in August, the last time we made ice cream. Just this week (December) I got it out and stuck it in the freezer, as we had some heavy whipping cream leftover from a recipe, so I thought I would whip up some ice cream the next day. When I went to retrieve the bowl the next day, it was sitting in my freezer in a pool of Blue. It seems the seal had broken and it was leaking the freezing fluid.So we got about 10 uses out of it, but for the price, I wasn't expecting it to break so quickly.In the end, it is more expensive than most stand alone units and the product, while easy to clean isn't durable enough to warrant the price."
5,just made my first batch!,"Length:: 2:51 MinsVideo I made while trying out my brand new Kitchen Aid ice cream attachment. Can't wait to make more ice cream or try other recipes sherbets or gelato. If you like using your KA, you'd love making ice-cream. IT does require some preparation beforehand, and you will need to put the bowl in the freezer (I just leave mine in there all the time) but the results are worth it."
5,Ice Cream maker works as expected,My husband and I purchased this to make ice cream at home with the cream from our raw milk. We have more perfecting to do but that is more with our recipes than the maker. It is easy to attach. The amount it makes is limited with the bowl but this process with the electric mixer beats working the arm muscles like we used to.
4,Ice Cream Maker Attachment,Love it and use it about once a week. I keep in the in the freezer and it is always ready to pull out and use. Home made ice cream in a short time. I use the recipe I had for my big freezer and save the other half of the mix to use a day or two later. I'm tempted to buy a second one so I could make a full gallon.Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star - - the fact the bowl needs to be frozen first.
2,It works but no better than anything else,This is an ok attachment but it has its flaws. It actually makes a fairly small serving of ice cream and you can only do about 1 batch a day with how long it takes to freeze the bowl. The way the mixer portion is set up it will jump teeth and get stuck if you are mixinf a heavier ice cream. It is just a lot of extra parts to keep track of when there are better options out there with a bowl youhave to freeze. Additionally I would argue that the old school ice bucket method works jstu as well if done correctly and you can do a lot more volume with that design.
5,KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker Attachment,"Love it! Had planned to get it for a while. When I saw the great price Amazon had it for, couldn't pass it up!"
4,Great Icecream!!! Long wait time...,"Makes great, creamy icecream! Much better than you can get in stores. However, you must freeze mixer bowl 15 hours and cool mixture for 8 hours before icecream can be mixed. Fairly easy to use."
5,Works like a charm!,"This KitchenAid ice cream maker is top of the line for making ice creams and sorbets at home. In combination with the Artisan Series mixer, the device does an excellent job of bringing a cold mixture to softserve consistency in 20 - 25 minutes. Be sure you chill the mixture in the frig for at least 2 hours before starting the freezing process. The ensures faster freezing time and smaller ice crystals, which equals a smooth, creamy texture in the finished product."
2,Disappointed,"Considering the quality of KitchenAid products I have owned and still own I was expecting this attachment to work as well, but that was not the case. I tried a couple of ways to keep the bowl cold long enough for the ice cream to freeze properly and nothing worked. It just isn't cold enough long enough and the ice cream just remains slushy and not firm at all. I put the mixture in an airtight container in the freezer after mixing it for at least 2-3 hrs before it maintained an ice cream consistency. I ended up returning this product for a refund and buying the regular electric ice cream freezer that takes ice and rock salt at half the price. Wish it would have worked."
3,careful when buying from overseas,Haven't been able to use the icecream attachment. The australian and european kitchenaid mixer doesn't fit the drive assembly as the USA mixer is shorter. So fits all mixers is not technically correct.
2,ice cream maker,The ice cream maker does make ice cream but is not an efficient way to do so. The dasher doesn't scrape the sides of the bowl close enough and the ingredients either freeze so fast that the dasher isn't able to move or it doesn't freeze it and you have to pour the mixture into containers and put it in the freezer. I wouldn't recommend buying this or any other attachments for the Kitchen Aid mixer. None of them work as would be expected.
4,Good but messy,A cost effective ice cream maker. Very messy to use though because you have to pour the mixture into the bowl while the machine is running. Not the end of the world though if you get to scoop up the dripps and have a taste of them.
3,"Not enough cooling capacity, poor drive design","I have two cooktops, a dishwasher, double oven, refrigerator, blender, food processor, and K5SS mixer from KitchenAid. They're all good products, but there have been several annoying failures, weak links caused by poor quality parts.I bought the ice cream maker to add to my selection of accessories for the stand mixer. While I am very pleased with all the other accessories, I am disappointed with the ice cream maker. Many reviewers write that it will only freeze to a soft-serve consistency. Mine will not even achieve that. The ice cream bowl lives in my freezer at zero degrees at all times, but it still does not have the capacity to do more than barely freeze the mixture.I have not had any mechanical failures with the dasher drive, but it is indeed a baling-wire-and-duct-tape engineering nightmare, caused by trying to make it fit too many mixer models. It inspires no confidence whatsoever that it will last over the long term."
1,Do not buy,"Unless you want your fridge blue! For no reason (it was never dropped, neither it hit any blunt surface) the bowl started to leak its blue coolant."
1,Terrible Waste of Time & Money !!,Like other consumers we now found out too that this product is garbage. Followed all instructions to the letter and allowed the bowl to sit in the drop freezer for 24 hours while the ice cream mixture sat in the fridge for same amount of time. The bowl thaws before the ice cream can thicken. It never got better than milk shake consistency. So back in the box it went and shipped back for a refund. Terribly disappointing product from Kitchenaid.
1,Don't be cheap! Spend A LOT MORE MONEY ON A REAL ICE CREAM MAKER,"I know how to make ice cream. I have had much better success with salt and ice machines. I will be returning this product and spending $1100 on an Italian ice cream maker that had better work. If not, off it will go and I will spend $3500 for a commercial machine that will definitely work. Ice cream starts to melt just as it begins to freeze. There is not enough inertia in this ""magic"" bowl to either get proper overrun or phase change to ANY ice cream mix I have thrown its way. It also does not work on sorbet. It will make slushes and milkshakes, though, but isn't a blender a better way of doing that in less than 50 minutes?"
2,$80 is WAY too much!,"This machine promises that it can deliver soft serve consistency in 20-30 minutes, and for added firmness, you can let it ""ripen"" in the freezer.I've had soft serve ice cream before, and this machine did not produce anything with that consistency for me. I tried twice, and at best came up with something resembling a soupy milkshake.Yes, it freezes to a decent consistency, but I think that for $80, I could at least get soft serve like down at the local Dairy Queen."
1,Not compatible with European stand mixers,"Great disappointment. That summarizes my experience with this attachment.The manual's first page has this phrase ""This attachment has been approved for use with all KitchenAid household stand mixers"". Nevertheless, it does not fit mixers marketed in Europe and Latin America. The mixer has a ring guard in the beater shaft that makes it impossible to use the ice cream attachment.I wish I could send it back, but I no longer have the box and it would cost a lot of money to mail it. I guess I will have to make a lamp out of it :-)"
2,It doesn't say it takes a long time to make ice cream,"I was going to get a soft serve ice cream maker, recommended by a friend, but then I saw the Kitchen Aid bowl and Ice Cream Maker Attachment. Since I have a Kitchen Aid mixer, I purchase this. It was a mistake! From my friend, she says you can just throw some things into the soft ice cream maker and have ice cream about 30 minutes later. This on the other hand is not like that and takes much more work. A poor purchasing decision."
2,Great Soft Serve at a Price,"I thought all you had to do was add the ingredients and it turn on. Boy was I wrong! Really wrong!!!Cook on stove, let cool, mix items with mixer, cook some more, let cool, wait 8 hours, add to mixer. And that was for vanilla only. Soft serve is great when it is first done. But after you put it in the freezer for a few days. It was like ice milk.For the price of the ingredients - I could have bought the best ice cream out there for less and not had to waste a day making it.What a mistake buying this.P.S. I does make a great drink, just like a 7/11 Slurpee. Just freeze bowl and add any soft drink (Carbonated or not), let run for 15 to 20 minutes. Comes out great."
2,would not buy again,"My free standing ice cream maker went kaput this summer, after 25 years. I decided to try the kitchen aid attachment. It is easy to assemble but adding fruit, etc. near the end of freezing is very difficult. Also, it is awkward to disassemble to serve the ice cream. I have been very disappointed by the firmness of the icecream, but it does say soft serve. It is just VERY soft (more like a melting milkshake)?"
3,"Loved it, but it didn't last","My husband and I love making ice cream with this attachment. It is easy to use and we've tried a variety of recipes (we especially love the ones at http://www.users.nwark.com/~piperw/icpage.htm). However, after a couple years of use (maybe used 15-20 times overall), the attachment began to leak the blue freezer fluid. I expected a pricey KitchenAid attachment to last longer than 15-20 uses. The store is letting us exchange for a new one, so hopefully we won't have the problem again."
5,KitchenAid IceCream maker,Bought as a gift for my gourmet cook son. He is very happy with it. Can attest to the fact that it makes DELICIOUS icecream.
5,Bought as a gift,"I bought this item as a gift, so I can't speak firsthand about this product. The recipient of the item, however, loved the item."
4,Good product,Not the easiest to use but made great ice cream. I will buy more KitchenAid products. I would recommend this product.
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I bought this thinking how cool it would be to use our brand new kitchen aid to make ice cream and that I would use this all the time and that was almost 2 years ago and I have only used it once! For one thing it takes an extensive amount of time to prepare the unit to use it. You have to put the bowl in the freezer (if you have room that is) for at least 12 hours to allow the liquid in the bowl to be frozen and than you can put it on your Kitchen Aid and you let it run for about 15 min with the ice cream mixture than its back into the freezer with the bowl to allow the ice cream to harden. Although it looks nice to me it was a waste of money. I would have been better off buying a Ice Cream Maker for half the price.
1,horrible DONT BUY,"it does not work. ive tried it at least 5 times now thinking i did something wrong but no. It just DOES NOT WORK. ive tried and tried. i used the recipes that it came with, and first of all they are WAYYY TO SWEET. but they also DONT WORK. AH too expensive to not work. also doesnt have an option to message the seller."
3,Just another ice cream maker,"I just do not like the fact that you have to freeze the bowl for 15 hours. Otherwise, it is just another ice cream maker."
1,The material made of - anodized aluminum.,"I was about to buy this product because I have the stand mixer and I love it.From the picture can't tell what material the inside of the bowl is made of, so I went to the company's web side [[...]] and chatted with them.The bowl is made inside of anodized aluminum.Anodized aluminum is in fact ALUMINUM.I told them aluminum is no longer acceptable to be used for products which get in direct contact with food; it is too toxic and people are getting more educated everyday, so they should replace the inside with a stainless steel one.Hope the company will respond to this information and will consider making a bowl of SS instead.It's up to us, the consumer, to demand from the producers what is best for us and our health.If we speak up, they will listen, so I encourage more people to call/chat/write to companies and tell them what we want. They will get the message faster when more of us speak up for ourselves."
1,weak plastic garbage attached to a strong motor is a recipe for BOOM,Broke the first time we used it. The paddle fractured in multiple places. Avoid IT!
2,Not worth the price,"I love my kitchenaid mixer and I love most of the attachments but not loving the ice cream maker. There are too many prep steps, the ice cream needs extra time to freeze after making it, and realistically the cost is more than buying a ice cream maker which is much better designed for the purpose."
4,non-dairy ice cream,Has anyone tried making a non-dairy ice cream? I love ice cream but I am allergic to casein. I don't want to purchase it if I can't make a good non-dairy version.
3,Has KitchenAid resolved the blue coolant leakage problem?,Has Kitchen Aid resolved the blue coolant leakage problem?Yes I know that this is not a review. I believe I have a right to question the integrity of a product that has been noted by several buyers so that I may avoid any future aggravations.
4,Only one issue,I made my first batch of icecream yesterday and I have to say it was fantastic. I used the french vanilla icecream recipe from the book and added my own twist with fresh mint and grated chocolate. The icecream was great and worth the effort. Looking forward to trying different recipes.For a healthier version I used egg whites instead of egg yolks in the french vanilla recipe and this also worked great.
5,Love it!,"This is a great ice cream mixer! I love that it isn't another appliance hanging round; rather, it is an attachment for one I already have!Be warned, this bowl needs to be kept in the freezer for 24hrs before you can use it. Mine lives in our freezer. We've made many rounds of gelato with it and it is so simple to use. Just turn on and leave alone until done!I definitely recommend this ice cream machine. It is easy to clean, no bigger than a bowl, and fits right in the appliance I already have."
1,Disappointed,"I preferred the Lumina ice cream machine that Aldi supermarket sold for $30- seriously it was amazing (while it lasted- 1.5 years). Unfortunately the KitchenAid ice cream bowl is uncovered so doesn't seal the cold in like others do. The paddle isn't great. I have used both plenty of times to make the same custard based Baci ice cream recipe by Nigella and the Lumina aerated the mixture, the KitchenAid did not. In other words, I used to get a lot more ice cream out of the same recipe with the Lumina machine. Kitchenaid makes it flat (like melted and refrozen ice cream). Damn. Im going to get a compressor machine next, hopefully that will do it."
1,Cooling Fluid Leaking,I have had this product for well over 4 or 5 years. And it was great until this year the fluid is leaking. I am so bummed. I loved it! But will not replace it. So disappointing that something that is only used in the summer for 4 or 5 batches is all ready worn out.
2,I think mine was a defective product!,"I received this ice cream maker as a gift. I was THRILLED to make my OWN ice cream and feed my addiction =)I tried 3 times to make ice cream...leaving the bowl in the freezer for a week before attempting. I could still hear liquid in the bowl. Needless to say, I tried the 3 recipes and none of them would freeze in the bowl. Everything remained like milk (thought I made the custard too thin, used a half recipe, 3rd time bought a thermometer to get the custard up to the correct temp). With much sadness I had to return it.I was given a cuisinart ice cream maker over a year ago. I hadn't attempted to make ice cream out of fear that the results would still stink! I gave it a whirl this weekend and I used my same recipe (full recipe that I did with the Kitchenaid attachment) and it actually turned out.My wasteline is definitely gonna thank me...HA!"
2,KitchenAid KICAOWH Ice Cream Maker Attachmet,I made a batch of French Vanilla Ice Cream from the recipe book that came with the Ice Cream maker. The Ice Cream was delicious but the bowl lost it's freeze before the ice cream was frozen. The bowl had been in my freezer for two weeks before I used it. I am going to try and freeze the bowl again in my chess freezer instead of my side by side refrigerator/freezer. If it works better that way I would up my rating.I also have a Cuiesenart ice cream maker and it always freeze's properly.
4,"When it works, it works great.","The attachment itself is finicky. I'm using it with a 600 pro series stand mixer, and the attachment doesn't always line up. When it does finally line up, it works well, and the ice cream comes out great. Be ready to alway have this bowl in your freezer, because it needs to chill for 15 hours before you use it."
1,A problem after three uses,"I'm using this with a 6 qt mixer. After two uses, the side holes stopped aligning with the pins in the mixer arms. Might work better with a smaller mixer."
4,Exellent ice cream maker!,"I bought this because, well, I love ice cream and my kitchen-aid (model K5SS-I wasn't sure if it would fit when I ordered it, but it does!). I really couldn't be a whole lot happier with it. It's easy to use, and freezes up awesome ice cream. The only reason I don't feel I can rate it 5 stars is that the paddle attachment is a little tricky to get onto the mixer. Once it's on it works fantastically, and I love not having to pack salt and ice to get ice cream. I keep the bowl in my freezer so I can make ice cream on a whim :)If you're looking for a great, easy to use ice cream maker, I highly recommend this one!"
3,Info from KitchenAid- not for mixers pre- 1990,"I was going to buy this, but our mixer is an older KC45. I saw some references that it might not fit. I contacted KitchenAid via live chat and:""No, I'm sorry it doesn't fit mixers that were made before 1990."""
3,Okay,A little tall for my freezer. Must take out ice bin to fit in the freezer. Ice cream still soft so need to freeze the ice cream an additional day before I can serve.
1,Poorly designed,Poorly designed driver and dasher. Ice cream mixture is not yet close to being soft serve before assembly pops apart. I was left with liquid ice cream mixture and a huge mess. A bit disturbing when assembly suddenly pops apart - and there is no putting it back together. I am a professional pastry chef who bought this for home use. I am deeply disappointed in this product.
5,I LOVE this attachment,This is so fun to use; it makes great ice cream and I love the fact that I just wash and throw it in the freezer for next time I want to use. I am super happy I bought this item!
5,Great product,"I made the best ice cream I have ever had with this (malted milk ball ice cream). It is easy to use and it's great to make your own Ice cream since you know what's in it (no additives, preservatives, etc). It will get you thinking creatively about the next best flavor! Move over Ben&Jerry's!"
5,Good deal,"This attachment works great. I've already used it several times and know I'll continue to use it for family get togethers and birthdays. Very easy to use. I found it works best to make the ice cream in two batches as the entire batch in the bowl is more difficult to manage as the mix turns into ice creams and increases in volume. Highly recommend it for the ice cream lover, who wants to have a special ice cream for a certain occasion or anytime!!"
3,Not as good as I expect from KitchenAid.,"I made a simple mint ice cream base with yolks. I froze the freezer bowl for about 5 days before making the ice cream. My first attempt made cold, chunky mint soup. Super disappointed! I poured out the base, cleaned the freezer bowl and refroze it at the deep freeze setting - to the detriment of the rest of my frozen goods. My next attempt 48 hours later did produce a frozen and aerated product though it had fat grits (probably from the previous attempt) and melted as soon as the product was scooped into a room temperature bowl. This is the first bad product I've used by KitchenAid."
5,Great Ice Cream Maker,"This ice cream Maker is ""GREAT"". The fact that I can use an industrial motor (my kitchen Aid mixer) is fantastic. It is my belief that the ice cream maker itself is as near perfect as you can get, contrary to other reviews. If you read the description and instructions, you will find that it is not the biggest maker on the market AND that it does EXACTLY what it says it will...IT MAKES ""GREAT"" ICE CREAM."
1,Defective...,"I received this product as a Christmas gift for use with my KitchenAid Professional 600 stand mixer. I made a single batch of vanilla without any problems shortly after receiving it. Attempts to churn/freeze ice cream the following summer were unsuccessful, however, as the temperature of the bowl was not sufficiently low to freeze the pre-chilled mixture. In addition, a hairline crack is visible adjacent to the alignment tab on the bowl, and blue fluid seeps from the crack during temperature changes. Since I have owned this bowl for longer than 1 year KitchenAid doesn't cover warranty replacement, even though I have only used it 3 times. While I have previously been very loyal to the KitchenAid product line, this negative experience comes shortly after a catastrophic blender failure. In addition, having owned several bad hand tools from this manufacturer including pastry brushes, cheese graters, and cookware, I think this may be the end of the line for me."
5,The best addition to our Kitchen Aid mixer!,"If you own a Kitchen Aid mixer, this should definitely be the first attachment you buy! My wife and I absolutely love using this and experimenting with different kinds of ice cream. A great thing to get along with this is the Ben & Jerry's recipe book. If you've always wanted to make your own ice cream, this makes it so very easy!"
5,Love it!,"this is the best ice cream maker. I have had others and this one is so simple and easy to use, especially the cleaning."
1,Not compatible as listed. NOT FOR 7QT,"Kitchen-Aid claims that this ice cream maker is compatible with ALL stand mixers made after 1990, HOWEVER it is NOT compatible with the new 7Qt stand mixer."
4,Pretty good,"The bowl is pretty durable and fit perfectly. It doesn't make as much ice cream as the bowl says, if you fill it to what it should take it will overflow and not mix properly. Stuff sticks to the side and you need to use the paddle to scrape the sides every 10 minutes. Work very well and was a good value. We purchased it to make our own 'dairy-free' ice cream: 2 cans of coconut milk, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa, 1/2 tsp salt, 1tsp vanilla, and 1 egg (all pre-chilled and mixed)."
1,KitchenAid Ice Cream maker attachment NOT for non US model machines,"Product is fine if you live in the US, waste of money if you are ordering from overseas. Product doesn't fit on KitchenAid mixers purchased outside of the US so this was a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY and has only cost me more to order replacement parts. Advertising is misleading and unless you investigate the numerous complaints from other people in the same situation you would never know as according to KitchenAid who's accessories/attachments FIT ALL MACHINES 'apparently'."
2,"Worked Great, Then Started Leaking","We had this attachment for our Kitchen Aid Artisan mixer and used it quite frequently to make some really nice ice cream. We took proper care of it, storing it upright, only washing it in cold water, etc. After only two years of use it starting leaking the blue cooling fluid at one of the seams in the plastic molding on the outside of the bowl. I expected better quality considering this product retails for $100.00. How about a better warranty Kitchen Aid?"
2,Does not work with chunky ingredients,"This product does not freeze ice cream well. The ice cream does not turn to ""soft serve"" like it should. Instead, the paddle just spins and spins while the freezer liquid inside the bowl loses its coldness. If you add anything to your ice cream, like fruit or nuts, forget about it working. The items actually melt the ice cream that somewhat froze to a grainy consistency. To top it all off, the blue liquid is now oozing out of the bottom of the bowl, and I have only used this freezer three or four times. Junk. Get the old fashioned kind if you want good ice cream."
3,Fun but not productive,"You have to freeze the bowl. Mix the ingridients first. And then after about 18 to 20 hours, you can make a small amount of icecream. I like the cheap bucket mixer in the garage better."
3,Not very frozen,"This doesnt really freeze ice cream very solid at all, in fact it leaves it somewhat liquid in the middle. I would love to find a good ice cream maker"
3,Lukewarm,"This lasted us 2.5 yrs. before it starting leaking the blue gunk. That doesn't sound too bad, but given I used it probably 10-12 times, I'm not too pleased. I was always careful to let it get back to room temp before washing, because I read the reviews that also said theirs leaked. Anyways, anytime I was in the mood for ice cream, it's a pain to have to put it in the freezer for 24 hrs. I'd forget the next day, which is a big reason I rarely used it. Not a bad product, but I was so careful with it, and it still broke with gentle handling and storage. I do not recommend this because of the sheer number of peopling stating theirs started leaking as well."
1,One Year Warranty in Stone - Leaks later? too bad!,"We have a KA stand mixer and I thought the Ice Cream Maker would be a good addition.I read the reviews and saw the problems people were having with it leaking the blue cooling fluid.Because this is not regularly used, too often the leak occurred in the 2nd year of ownership.I wrote KA with my concern as I would be one of those who would not use is very frequently.They wrote back that their research shows that if a manufacturer's defect is going to show up, it will show up in the first 3 months, so by offering the one year warranty, they're already extending the warranty by 9 months.They seemed unfazed by the infrequent usage effect on defects showing up.I've also written to America's Test Kitchen to ask that when they evaluate items that they go beyond their in-house testing to find out what people have to say about a product over time.I will keep looking for something to sorbet and gelato with. It will not be this attachment."
2,Returned item,"After reviewing the recipe book that came with the ice cream maker, I realized that the process was quite entailed and time consuming and that it was also a very expensive to make. Therefore, I returned the product."
2,Not our favorite Kitchn Aid attachment,"We were excited to get the ice cream bowl attachment, but it didn't live up to our expectations for it. It is a one use item that sits around a lot and gets used a little. It doesn't make much ice cream."
5,"so much fun, and great ice cream - compact","Great price for this item and since I already had a kitchen aid mixer, I figured this would save me some space in my pantry. It was very easy to use and it was fun watching the ice cream churn and quadruple in size. It was a little difficult getting the ice cream off the dasher, but no biggie, just lick it off right? Still plenty to fill a 64 oz plastic container from one batch of vanilla from the recipe book (8cups). Love it."
4,Simply Amazing!,"Who would have thought this simple little bucket could make such fun yum yums! We have tried several recipes and every single batch of ice cream has come out amazing. My only gripe about it is the attachment piece that goes on the mixer. It is understandable to have the lower piece made out of plastic so that it doesn't scratch the interior surface, but the upper piece simply looks like it could wear out quickly. It has these tiny little rubber feet that grip on to the mixer head and I can't stop wondering why they didn't use either an entire rubber replaceable ring or perhaps some type of clamping system. When this part fails, I hope Kitchen Aid can replace just that part. Another boo is that once you mix 1 30 minute batch, you need to stick it back in the freezer overnight to do another batch.Other than those small little thing, this bowl works just as a dedicated ice cream maker should, but without the heft since it is one less appliance to have."
1,Not suitable for Australian KitchenAid Mixers,"What a shame it is packaged as being suitable for all KitchenAid Mixers when it is not! Beware Australian customers, you will have to purchase additional parts to make it work on your Australian Mixers."
2,"Good ice cream, bad product","The ice cream maker works as advertised for about 2-3 years. However, if you use it fairly frequently (about once a month), the plastic housing for the bowl begins to crack. Once that happens, forget it. The blue freezing liquid inside the bowl begins to leak, and in addition to being a mess in your cupboard and freezer, it won't properly freeze the ice cream any more. A friend of mine had the exact same freezer attachment for his Kitchen Aid and the same thing happened, so it is not an isolated incident. It's too bad because it was fairly convenient and easy to use, but at $70 a pop just to replace the bowl, I think I will replace it with a stand-alone ice cream maker."
5,Tons of fun,"We are recently trying to buy things less processed so we added this to our collection in hopes to make our own icecream when we get the craving along with being able to know what is in my ice cream and making it more diet friendly. This thing is very easy to use along with making great ice cream. Yeah when you are done its soft serve but thats fine with me. You can also freeze the ice cream for later use with it harder. So far i have kinda made my own recipe and used the ben n jerrys book but substituting to make the recipes healthier and this has been awesome. I made one the other day that wasnt as creamy but it was delicious..i used ideal sugar substitute, eggs, vanilla extract, FF milk and almond milk and it was 58 cals per cup! you cant beat that for a treat."
2,Don't buy this one!,"I've made many batches of ice cream on both the old fashioned hand crank machines and professional ones. This machine is the worst! The mix has to be icy before it will set and even still doesn't always do it. I hate this machine, if I hadn't had it for so long I would return it. I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because you can make it work, just not in a warm room or within ice cream base that is warmer than almost freezing (34) degrees"
4,It Works,"Purchased this unit on recommendation of Cook's Illustrated. The first unit received did not work! It is not very complicated, but it simply did not freeze ice cream. The replacement unit works wonderfully. The ice cream/gelatos are superior than those made with our Cuisinart unit. I have yet to fill this unit without a bit of spillage. That said, I am very satisfied."
3,Problem with bowl,After several years use the liquid in the bowl started leaking at the place where the spring loaded ball attaches to the mixer probably because of high stress at this point. I patched it with epoxy and I still use it.
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR AUSTRALIAN MIXER MODEL,BUYER BEWARE! This item does not fit Australia/New Zealand models. You must buy additional parts to make this product work. WARNING!!!!!
2,Much better options out there,"I'm an engineer and can fix just about anything. I know machines. While I love my Kitchen Aid mixer this ice cream attachment is a rather poor implementation. The method KA uses to attach the mixer is just a poor design. The attachment bracket is pressure fit to the head of the mixer that relies on little friction pads to keep it in place. The set up works if you're willing to putz with it continuously, but I found it's just WAY too much hassle. It will work if you're making ice cream and don't let it get too hard. Forget it if you're making frozen yogurt, which gets harder faster. By the end of the process my hands were all sticky from stopping the machine repeatedly to push the attachment bracket back on. My 4 year old however really enjoyed getting dirty! I eventually returned this to Target as there are much better options out there for less money."
5,"Yum, Yum, Yum!","Homemade ice cream without gums, stabilizers, artificial flavors, etc. Absolutely fabulous, easy to use, all but the bowl is dishwasher safe."
5,Fabulous,"Well, I finally tried my new Ice cream maker attachment this week-end and I have gotten rave reviews from family, they can't beleive it came out so good. I live in Jamaica where it gets hot and humid pretty early in the day sometimes, so with that in mind, I made the base the day before and the next morning before it got too hot I made the Ice cream. One thing I noticed it did not freeze at all after 20 min so I did it for 30 min still no luck so I went ahead and removed the mixture to my container to freeze, once frozen it was the best. I attribute that to the humidity or maybe because I used heavy cream instead of half and half........all that aside its a fantastic option one less kitchen appliance to buy if you already have a Kitchen Aide.Dawn in JA"
5,Makes yummy ice cream easily,"Since this product has liquid in the bowl itself, you avoid the salt and ice hassle of yesteryear. The recipes in the book are fine, but Alton Brown's recipe for ice cream is my favorite. Look up Mint chip ice cream on Food Network. I mixed his chocolate recipe with the mint (be careful I only use a quarter of the mint oil he suggests)and it is the best!"
4,Solid performer,I have used other electric ice cream makers in the past and bought this because I thought my KitchenAid mixer would have a stronger motor than those did and I was right. Worked perfectly with the first batch and I've been happy ever since. The motor never slows down even when the ice cream firms up and the ice cream is smooth and creamy.
5,icey YUM,"I love my KitchenAid ice cream maker. I especially love making sorbets. I read the reviews before I bought mine and knew it would work for me. I keep the bowl in the freezer, mine is very cold, and use it as the instructions say. I have been cosistently happy with the performance of the bowl. Well worth it...... finding the recipe that I love is a little harder."
4,Should have purchased sooner,I have been on the fence about buying this attachment for my standmixer. I'm so glad I did! I did a beautiful job of making softserve and it was fairly simple to use. Just make sure to follow the instructions and have it well frozen and also make sure all your ingrediants are cool/chilled as well.
3,kitchen aid ice cream attachment.,takes up room in the freezer where you have to keep it. but makes pretty good ice cream. makes small amounts at one time. then you have to refreeze the attachement for another 8 hours.
3,Pretty darn good but not great,"OK, well, it makes ice cream, allows me to make at home, create a flavor, serve homemade ice cream, but it ""aint like they used to be"". The old fasioned ice and salt method creates a much better result in terms of texture. The dasher doesn't quite clear the ice crystals away from the sides cleanly, the bowl does not stay cold enough long enough. I keep the bowl in the deep freeze, insultate with kitchen towels while in use, wtc but it still doesnt seem to stay cold enough. There's something missing from the original method. I have to say I miss the $3 electric maker I got at a thrift shop years ago whose motor conked out but used ice and salt. This one DOES beat a hand-crank though since you can have it running while finishing up dinner rather than enlisting your guests to pitch in with turns cranking!"
5,One Happy Gal!,WOW! Homemade ice cream sooooo easy and sooooo good! The freezer attachment worked like a charm! The only advice I would offer is to use Mexican vanilla in the recipe.
4,Great birthday gift,I bought this for my 26 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves ice cream and loved the gift. She's slowly collecting all the attachments for her Kitchenaid.
1,Makes poor consistency ice cream,"The slowest speed on the Kitchenaid mixer is much too fast for making ice cream. At over 60 rpm, the dasher injects so much air into the mixture that the finished product has the consistency of whipped cream after only 15 minutes. Churning for a shorter time produces a soupy, half-frozen mixture that freezes into a solid block in the freezer. I have tried many recipes and flavors with this device and the result is the same every time. There are many fine uses for a Kitchenaid mixer but making ice cream is not one of them."
2,Doesn't work on Australian Kitchenaid,WARNINGThe icecream attachment will not fit onto Kitchenaid mixers in Australia. I am trying to find out where to get the alternate attachement but it is not easy.
5,KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker,"This was purchased a Christmas gift and has not yet been given. However, I have one of these ice cream makers myself and have given others to my children. Like all KitchenAid products this is a good value and a useful item. The product is easy to use and produces an excellent soft-serve ice cream. It is a great alternative to the old fashioned freezers using ice and rock salt. I strongly recommend it to owners of KitchenAid mixers."
5,KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker,"Talk about an easy to use product! A day after I got it in the mail I was making great ice cream. It takes a day for it to freeze, not a day, more like over night. So you get your ingredients together and 20 minutes later you've got good ice cream. The hard part is keeping it in stock. A great accessory for your mixer."
2,Does NOT FIT all models of Kitchenaid stand mixers!,"Even though on the website, this Amazon page, and in the manual it states that this attachment fits all models, I can testify that it does NOT fit on mine. I have the ""international"" version of stand mixer (model 5K5SS) and it is NOT compatible with my mixer. There is some mention on the Kitchenaid site that there is an adapter piece that you can buy somewhere overseas, but I have not been able to locate it. This attachment looks amazing, and I'd love to have the convenience of making ice cream with my stand mixer, but alas, it is not meant to be.If you live overseas and have stand mixer model 5K5SS, do NOT buy this attachment--it will NOT work with your mixer."
5,So Far SOOOOO GOOD,"This attachment works just as it's supposed to. It doesn't make slush, it makes soft serve ice cream, just like 99% of the ice cream makers on the planet. For a harder ice cream simply freeze it for a couple hours in an airtight container, not the freezer bowl. Also, in my experience, this bowl is only good for 1 batch, then it needs to be frozen again before making another.Ice Cream Maker Attachment 101Use a good recipe (I steal mine from food network)Freeze bowl for a min 15 hoursHave everything assembled, running and mixture cooled to below 40 deg before pouring into the bowl. I usually fill mine halfway, any more and I run the risk of an overflow.Have fun with it."
4,"Excellent , silky ice cream!","We just got this ice cream maker and, while the ""dasher"" was a bit tricky to attach, we're VERY glad we purchased this. There are two reasons why we like it.First, the ice cream was EXCELLENT: truly ""silky"", much like the texture of gelato that you buy in Italy. No ice crystals and FAR superior to any purchased premium ice creams and custards we've ever tried.Second, since this attaches to a Kitchen Aid mixer, there is no bulky electronic housing or motor to store. Basically put the beater & dasher into bowl and ""store""it in the freezer. Then, you're ready to go, whenever you want. What could be more convenient?"
5,EASY - EASY - EASY!!,"Wow, compared to other ice cream makers, this one is super easy! Just do as we all learned in kindergarden....follow the directions! If you're looking for a no-fail ice cream maker, this is the one for you! No rock salt, no hand cranking....yipee!!"
5,awesome,It's a great attachment the ice cream is better than store bought it is ready in about 15 minutes and is very easy to assemble and clean
2,cracked after a few uses,"i received this item as a gift and used it a few times to make ice cream. After only a few use I noticed that the plastic attachment that hooks into the paddle/mixer cracked. It still works, but it looks like it could fail at any time. The bowl and mixer made good ice cream, but I just wasn't impressed that after only a few uses it broke. Normally KitchenAid is quality but in my case not so much on this one.Based on the other positive reviews though it sounds like my experience was a very limited occurance. Perhaps I just got a defective unit."
4,froyo heaven,"I use this ice cream maker to make frozen yogurt! So easy to make, just dump in a container of your favorite yogurt and/or some pureed fruit and in 15 minutes you have a delicious healthy frozen treat!The only con: I wish there was a handle on the bowl to make scooping out the ""ice cream"" easier."
3,Hope for the best,"I had wanted this attachment for my KSM5 for a few years and finally decided to get it. Right out of the box there was an obvious problem. The drive shaft attachment didn't fit onto the motor housing. In the instruction manual it says it will fit securely. No, it doesn't. I called KitchenAid. They said it does. I put it together. Still not right. I called KitchenAid. Well, actually the manual is wrong, it doesn't fit securely what it means to say is that when the beater is in place and the bowl is raised then it will fit securely. I make a batch of ice cream but before it's done the beater and the drive shaft attachment fly off because it doesn't fit securely. I call KitchenAid, they send a video clip to show me how. Okay. I try again. Again as the ice cream firms up, the pieces come apart. I feel like returning it since it's a big annoyance. However, if I can get past the annoyance of having to stand over the unit watching it, the ice cream is quite good."
2,Leaked blue fluid after light use,"My attachment started leaking blue fluid. We have had it for 3 to 4 years, but have used it regularly for the past year (2 to 3 times per month). I am super sad/disappointed! I loved the product, but would expect something that I pay $100 for to last longer especially when it comes from a reputable company like Kitchen Aid."
2,Money better elsewhere,"I bought this as an addition to the kitchen aid mixer. I was really excited to make my first batch of ice cream after leaving the bowl in the freezer for two days. I put my ice cream mixture in and let it mix and mix... never getting to the consistency I'd expect. Its good at making slushies, but not good thick and creamy ice cream. I felt that the bowl never stayed cold long enough. I returned it and bought the cheaper, but far better Cuisinart ICE-30BCuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Makerwhich makes ice cream and gelato without a hitch.I expected more and better from a kitchen aid product."
3,"nice product, but could be better","Overall, I like it but I think that the freezing time could be improved. The unit comes with some liquid inside that requires 15 hours to freeze. That is too long! Also, once out of the freezer it unfreezes in about 40 minutes, which is not enough time to make a second batch. That is frustrating if you are planning an ice cream party."
1,Beware - Only fits US models,"To save you the return process I am going through, please note this model does not fit international kitchenaid mixers. The assembly does not fit over the small ring & spring on the international mixers. It was only after my ice cream maker arrived that I discovered this. A quick check online confirmed, as you will see from this comment from Kitchenaid USA on this youtube instructional video [...]""Hi Thank you for your interest in the KitchenAid Ice Cream Attachment. KitchenAid&#65279; manufactures 2 Ice Cream Maker Attachments. One is for the US, and one for International users.. The International Ice Cream Maker has a different dasher&#65279; & drive assembly. This allows the drive assembly to fit around the disc on the beater shaft of an International mixer.""I am unsure of the model number for the international version, but would appreciate any info."
1,Very disappointing south Africans be warned,This attachment does not fit kitchen aids bought in south Africa even though it says it will fit all mixers! Very disappointing especially for Kitchenaid!
1,Broke after a few uses,After being used about ten times it sat in the cabinet for a few months and started leaking blue liquid. When I contacted Kitchenaid they said it was past the warranty for that defect and wouldn't refund my money. For $70 it should have lasted much longer. And there should be no time limit on defective products.
2,Warning Australian Buyers,A warning to Australian buyers...although the product description says that this attachment fits all Stand Mixers it is not compatible with Kitchenaid mixers sold in Australia as the drive assembly only fits the American model. Very disapointed to have the Ice Cream bowl arrive and cannot use it without purchasing a very expensive adaptor. This purchase did not turn out to be the bargain I thought it was.
3,"great idea, but a few problems","My brother gave this to me for Christmas and I thought it was a great idea, but I had a few problems. The instructions say that you have to pour in the ice cream mixture once you start the mixer. This is very hard to do unless you have something with a nice long spout. Also, I used their vanilla recipe, but only used 4 c. of liquid and 6 egg yolks (instead of 5 cups and 8 egg yolks). The bowl was overflowing by 15 minutes and I couldn't add the stawberries the last 2 minutes like they said. Finally, there is no handle on the bowl, and since it is heavy as lead, its very hard to transfer the ice cream into another container to ripen it in the freezer. However, despite all this, it was the best taking ice cream I've ever had."
1,Creates an unacceptable product,"I am a professional pastry chef, this was purchased for home use. I am not using the product incorrectly. Due to a fatal design flaw, the dasher stops churning the ice cream well before even a soft serve consistency is reached. That means you must freeze the ice cream before it is fully churned which creates large undesirable ice crystals. Furthermore, in spite of the ""Hassle Free Guarantee"" I was hassled for a good forty five minutes, told I was using it wrong and I didn't know what I was talking about. Ultimately had to speak to two supervisors to return the product."
3,kitchen aid ice cream maker,I takes longer than it says to make ice cream. A lot of preparation. Just experimenting now but maybe once get more used to it will be better
2,Not a fan,"I know tons of people love their KA ice cream attachments, but this just did not work for me. I have tried so hard to like this product, but it lets too much air in and my ice cream always turns out too airy almost like a mousse consistancy...I have tried about 5 different recipes and 3 of those same recipes in a friends wooden bucket ice cream maker. They turned out perfect in the wooden one so I know it isnt the recipes that are the problem. Does anyone have good info on how to keep from getting airy, fluffy ice cream? I have it on the stir setting, I keep my bowl in the freezer 24/7. I dont think I am doing anything wrong. Is this just how everyones ice cream comes out? I just cant give a rating for this above a two since my ice cream doesnt come out as good in this maker."
1,Does not work with Kitchenaid mixer on Australian market.,"Very disappointing as the attachment is not compatable with the American made Kitchenaid designed for the European market. Australia somehow falls into this category. There is no way you can possibly know, as the mixer box gives no indication of this difference. Postage back to Amazon from Australia was $99, so I am seriously out of pocket, due to poor communication from Amazon."
1,Doesn't work on 220V (European) mixer,"I'm moving fro the USA to Asia and bought both a new 220V Kitchenaid Heavy Duty mixer and the Ice Cream maker attachment. Well, the ice cream paddle attachment doesn't fit over the beater shaft because there's a large metal disc blocking the way. When I looked at the mixer manual, it doesn't depict the metal disk at all. The paddle works on my regular US mixer, but that doesn't help me overseas."
4,GOOD CHOICE,"f you like homemade ice cream, this attachment is GOOD CHOICE !!It is so fast and eliminates the need for ice or salt.Just keep it in your freezer all the time and you can make ice cream !"
5,Make the best ever ice cream,"Everyone loves ice cream and homemade means making ice cream your way. For me that means ""Diabetic Ice Cream"".... yep, only 3 carbs a serving and I can eat any flavor. I love making my ice cream, but it is not instant. First I make the mixture then chill it over night. That done I set up the Kitchen Aid and 20 minutes later I have soft serve. I make almost half a gallon per batch and freeze for later. Clean up is simple and I store the bowl in my freezer so it is ready when I am. Triple Chocolate sounds good for later, ya think.....KitchenAid KICA0WH Ice Cream Maker Attachment"
5,Yummy homemade ice cream!,"I've only made vanilla so far, but the possibilities are endless. We've mixed in cookie dough, strawberries, and brownies all to rave reviews. I needed an eggless recipe, and I wanted easy. Found this simple recipe online and I don't think you can beat it.2/3 cups sugar2 cups heavy cream1 cup milk1-2 teaspoons vanilla (or to taste)That's it. I am going to experiment with less fatty ingredients, next I'll try half and half instead of heavy cream. But this comes out like soft serve after about 25 mintues. We put it in the freezer and let it get harder before eating, but it is delicious either way."
5,delicious!,"The KitchenAid Ice Cream Maker works very well. I have made ice cream and frozen yogurt and frozen custard and been very pleased. It helps that I am in dairy country (WI) and have access to TWO excellent sources of wonderful cream (Blue Marble Dairy and Organic Valley). It takes about a half hour, but the hard part is thinking ahead. If you use a recipe that calls for heating your ingredients, you have to allow enough time for it to chill before putting it in the ice cream maker. The maker itself has to chill in the freezer, but I just store mine there. The end result is delicious. Downside: if you don't make a custard first, the ice cream is sometimes a bit grainy, but not bad."
2,Great for Milkshakes...,It doesn't really make a solid ice cream. We have tried several times and it just doesn't work like our bucket of ice and salt maker.I wouldn't suggect.
4,good,"This ice cream maker is easy for me to use and produces good ice cream. I've made several types of ice cream using this and the only thing that I have trouble with is pouring the ice cream into the bowl as it is spinning. This may be because I have the KitchenAid lifter and not the tilt head. Other than that, I enjoy using this attachment for ice cream."
1,"I read the poor reviews regarding the poorly designed attachement, but still purchased it...bad move","I read the poor reviews regarding the poorly designed attachement, but still purchased it...bad move. I'm pretty handly around the house and I thought that maybe the other people who gave poor reviews just did not attach the mixing head properly. I was so wrong.....the plastic part that attaches to the rotating arm is fixed in place with friction only!!!!as the ice cream starts to get thicker it will slide off. Also, when we recieved the product the bowl was already leaking fluid.....not worth your trouble......"
1,Ice Cream Attachment for Sale,I recently purchased this attachment for myself:) I live in Australia and unfortunately the American attachments do not fit the Australian Kitchen Aid mixers :(Overseas buyers beware!
4,Kitchen Aid Ice Cream Maker Attachment,"The ice cream attachment is good at making small quantities of ice cream. The french vanilla recipe in the manual is exceptional!!!!A few pointers: 1) even though they say it makes 2 quarts, it is best to make 1 quart batches because is no lid for the bowl to keep the mixture cold, 2) I tie a towel around the top of the bowl placed between the mixer as sort of a lid to keep the bowl as cold as possible, and 3) it is best to chill theice cream mixture before mixing it in the bowl.Over all it is easy to clean and no mess. But you half to like making ice cream in small quantities."
1,Plastic Darts,I purchased these so my grandchildren would have something to use on my bristle hair dart board. I tried throwing them and they won't even stick into the dart board-they bounce off it.
5,Great product,I needed these for an upcoming birthday party balloon pop. They are a quality product for a great price. My daughter and her friends will have a wonderful time.
2,You get what you pay for,I have an old cork board and unless I take a pitchers wind up these darts aren't sharp enough and don't have enough mass to stick in the board. Also they don't fly very straight. Great if you need a gimmick dart though.
2,Bad darts,Don't stick in my dartboard at an exceedingly high rate. I have another set of (admittedly nicer) darts that don't have the problem at all. I'd recommend spending the extra couple bucks for a better set.
2,Great for popping balloons...not so much for hitting a dart board,"If you are buying these for a child's party that involves popping balloons, then I think they are great. If you are trying to find a cheap dart set for your dart board, then don't waste your money. These will bounce off your dart board more than they will stick and they fly anywhere they want to go. Spend a little more for a dart that will hit its mark and not cause damage to everything surrounding your target."
1,Not worth it,"I expected that these would be a little smaller, but I can't really even see my kids learning to throw with these. I'm sure they would be useless for an adult hand. I just ordered some different ones.....for just a bit more $$ you can order a decent full size set of 3 darts."
2,Mini Darts,"In the product description it says ""These darts are slightly smaller than regulation size"". This is a considerable understatement as the darts are quite small, not just smaller. My regular darts are six inches long and these darts are four and a quarter inches long. They were too small to use and I tossed them out."
1,"Too light, Too Flimsy = Waste of money.",At 8 grams they weigh less than half of other products. Due to being underweight they do not fly on a stable path and do not have enough momentum to stick in the board. Their plastic fins are easily bent because they bounce off the board causing them not to fly straight as well. They are also not the typical length so it is awkward to grip them. I urge you not to waste the time and money. Upgrade for $2.50 and by two sets similar to the Halex Competition Darts 18 gram (66200).
1,Crappy Product,Platsic darts with no real quality. The plastic end has no weight and is not worth the super low proce. Only buy if you want to waste money. Spend the few extra $ and get a heavier product.
3,They are what they are,"I bought these for our dart party, they are darts and work well.. wasn't looking for something over the board and they worked out just fine"
1,Waste of money,"These darts are so light a flimsy they can not be thrown with any accuratacy. If you are asking yourself are these a toy, absolutely not! The pionts on the darts are as sharp as a needle, they are sharper than professional darts that cost over $100. I can go to Kmart and for the same money buy a better set of darts. Amazon should take this item off their site, there is no good use for this item."
4,Small Darts,"I bought these to replace a couple of darts that came with my dart board. They are nice little darts but are about 3/4"" smaller or shorter than regular darts. They are good for children but not adults as they are to small. I give them a four star as they should be regular size but if you like smaller darts and that doesn't matter to you then buy them. Guess I'll go to Target or Walmart to buy regulation sizes that I need. And you can't expect to much for $2.50 Cheers."
4,Great for the bar!,"These are fairly small and may not be of professional quality, but they are the only darts I use at my bar. We have darts in almost constant use, so we needed some that are very durable. After going through hundreds of ""better"" darts, we found that these last much longer that traditional darts, and I haven't seen much a difference in performance. Highly recommended."
2,Poor quality,"Actually i dont like them.They were good at first when i firstbought them,but with time they bended a little and did not become ableto aim accuratly..cause the do not fly in a straght line.."
2,Mini Darts,These darts are like they are made for little people. Wouldn't recommend them if you are looking for anything close to regulation size/type. The tails are attached; each dart is just one piece. They are really light and I had to throw them with all my might to get them to stick in my board. I will keep them so that my drunk friends don't break my good set of darts.
2,Dart Set,I had trouble with this dart set. It was so lightweight that I had a hard time getting the darts to stick in the dart board.
2,advantage to stress,"Found 58 softgels in each of 2 bottles instead of printed on label as ""60"". I counted each bottle 4 times to make sure. Never had such a bad experience with any product."
2,UPDATE Review!!,"I am updating my previous review. After using Supercritical Stress Advantage off and on for over a year, I have found this product not effective. This is my second New Chapter purchase that did not work for me. When I initially begin taking this product, I took it in conjunction with other calming products so that is probably why I thought it was doing such a good job. After trying it several times recently by itself on an empty stomach and with food, I felt nothing! New Chapter products are pricey and for the price I thought I was getting a quality product, I will not purchase again. I have started taking L-Theanine and it is working well for me."
4,relax,I had my 2 doctors review this product and both stated it was safe. In my opinion it works as described and that was what I wanted.Kathy K
3,"This was supposed to be peppermint, but in ...","This was supposed to be peppermint, but in my opinion, it didn't taste like peppermint. I did like the way it made my mouth feel -- nice and clean and fresh. I also liked the fact that there was baking soda in it. But because of the taste and the fact it's a little expensive, I probably wouldn't buy it again. I think I'll stick with my Colgate Total."
4,"I've used Tom's of Maine before, but not ...","I've used Tom's of Maine before, but not this flavor. I expected it to be a little more pepperminty, but after using it for a couple of days, I've become used to the taste. I do like the feel of the toothpaste and plan on continuing to use and purchase this product. It seems to be cleaning my teeth very well and I really like the fact that I can pronounce the ingredients!"
4,This toothpaste takes some time to get used ...,"This toothpaste takes some time to get used to. The first time I used it I was making """"that face"""" the entire time. After a couple of days went by, I actually began to like the taste and the feel. My husband noted something that I hadn't noticed -- this toothpaste doesn't foam up nearly as much as the leading brands. Once you've brushed with this product a few times, you'll begin to stop noticing the lack of sweetness and begin to notice the taste of the peppermint coming through. Even though the evaluation time is over, I'll continue to brush with this product. I don't think it's for everyone, but if you want a more natural way to clean your teeth, this is your toothpaste."
5,A must for anyone interested in Jewish musical development,"Mr. Idelsohn takes the reader on a musical trek of discovery. One of the greatest casualties of centuries of oppression against the Jewish people was their musical expression - as a unique art form arose, the community would be destroyed and dispersed leaving behind only an echo which was picked up by survivors. Jewish music today is a hybrid with a strong foundation from Temple times. The author explains the connection and proves the point that even though Jewish music was influenced by non-Jewish music, that same non-Jewish music owes much to the ancient Hebrew modes that preceded it.Stephen Simpson (steves@shani.net) 1997"
2,"so,so",This product isn't as heavy duty as it appears in the pictures. I think a better description would be helpful to know the diameter of the bolt. It didn't meet my needs.

5,Must Read!!!!!!!,I couldn't put this book down!!! I like how the author makes you wait until the last chapter to find out why her mother hates her so.I sent a recommendation to Black Expressions to put this book in their catalog!!1Keep up the good work Kieja....waiting for the next one.
5,Written in Red Ink is HOT! HOT! HOT!,"I enjoyed the book. It was a real page turner. As a mother of teenagers, I can relate to the emotional changes that some of the characters went through. The mother-daughter dynamics were very real. I would recommend this book to those who like romance and suspense. I'd certainly like to know what happens to the Bennett family in the future! Give me more!"
4,Definitely worth your time...,"I had to keep reading. The storyline kept me wanting to get to the reason for Emily's mother's hatred. The various situations that she encountered with her daughter, friend, Maple Honey and most of all herself had you rooted. There were times that I wanted to hug Emily and then slap her into reality. The author brought the characters and the events surrounding them to life for me. I only had one problem, Milo. I could not make out if his dual role, cop/jerk(I don't want to give anything away), was intentional or did the author forget that she had written him in as a cop. Regardless, I loved the book and definitely recommend it to others. I look forward to the next project."
4,Written in Red Ink,"I learned of this book in BBW magazine, and purchased it. It's an interesting story about family relationships within and between generations.Being a former English teacher myself, I did find some minor faults in the editing here and there. But, I thoroughly enjoyed the story."
5,First John Saul Book,This was my first John Saul book. It grabs you right from the beginning and doesn't let go until the very end. No way could I guess what was comming up.
4,Spooky story!,"This was my third John Saul novel and it was spooky and original. I had previously read The Manhattan Hunt Club and Midnight Voices, both of which I enjoyed. This novel wasn't exactly a page-turner but I kept reading to see what was going on. I honestly had no idea what was happening or what would happen in the end so that made it even more entertaining. The ending left a little question as to whether the other tormenters of Seth and Angel were punished as well. But overall, this novel was creative and worth the time."
1,"Unimaginative, Boring, Predicatable, Incomplete","This was my first reading of John Saul and it will be my last. The old haunted house story is admittedly old hat but I have read authors who have brought new spices to the tale. This story, I couldn't wait to finish, not becuase it was good but I just felt obliged to finish, hoping that ,in the end, it would be worth the read, well... WRONG! Seth and Angle were so helpless and abysmal that I could work up no sympathy for them. Angle's mother was ineffectual, Seth's mother was inffectual. Both fathers were sadistic bullies and why did the priest even exist. The characters were formulaic, The plot was predictable and shallow. The ending was dissapointing with no real reason why it ended the way it did. This book will go in the box with all the other losers I've read."
2,Story has been done to death!,"I was very disappointed with the book for many reasons. First, the story is cliche and has been done to death - black cat, haunted house, witches and magic. Secondly, I didn't feel that the characters were believable. An example is the Marty Sullivan character, a loser and a drunkard with an attitude - the guy you love to hate. His wife is very religious and very proper. Towards the end of the book there are a couple of times where she yells at him and he shrinks like a raisin and takes it from her. This is just not believable in a character like Marty Sullivan. The end was surprising and very abrupt - but also not believable."
1,Started off well but..............,"didn't know how to end it so the author took the easy way out. You've got 2 kids who are different so this makes them targets. They find a hidden book that provides them with ""recipes"" that allows them to get even with their peers. Interesting so far, right? Well, instead of developing the characters and allowing them to find out for themselves that retaliation can end up hurting you, the author kills them off. It's almost like two different authors wrote this. You get this wonderful build up of a possible haunting in the first 3/4 of the book and then it ends very abrubtly. I usually get sucked in by the author because of the premise of the story but always end up disappointed. I always hope that the author will improve but so far I've only wasted my time. Thank goodness I didn't buy this book - libraries are wonderful places."
2,Black Creek Crossing - disappointed,"This book started out really good - I loved the setting, and the characters, but when the ""magic cat"" came into the story, I totally lost interest. It almost seemed juvenile and didn't quite fit. I'm having a hard time finishing it."
3,"Interesting, slightly disturbing","I've never particularly been a Saul fan, but this book was quite good. It's a bit slow sometimes and it wakes awhile for it to pick up the pace. Teens will love this book, but It might prove to be a bit of a challenge to get through for the older crowd. The ending is surprising, and you have an eerie feeling after you've finished it. I recommend this for a long plane or car ride."
2,"Started out great, left me wishing I hadn't read it","I was intrigued by the beginning of the story, a mysterious house, a troubled family, a close-minded community, talk of ghosts and sinister happenings.... and the end just left me cold! I was not happy with the way this book ended. I've never read a John Saul book, is this the way things always end? I may not be picking up a book of his again. I can think of so many ways in which the book could have ended that would have left readers satisfied, or at least not sorry to have read the book. Very dissapointing..."
3,"Something Old, Something New....","While this was a mostly entertaining read, the cast of characters was seemed right out of the horror story master template: outcast teen ""heroes"", good-looking cool crowd tormentors, unsupportive and/or abusive parents, etc. We've seen them all before- many times! Even the ""evil house"" theme has been done to death. But if you can take the book for what it is, it can be a mostly enjoyable read to pass a rainy summer day (or night!). My main complaint would be the ending of the story which seemed rushed. The fate of the two main protagonists seemed to come out of left field and the story left several loose ends, namely the fate of two of the main tormentors and also never explained the reason for the ""specialness"" of the tree, which plays a big part in the story. Not a terrible book, but definately not his best."
5,Absolutely Great!,"This is yet another great book by John Saul. After you start reading it, you won't want to put it down."
3,Carrie's Children???,"Although I enjoyed reading this page turner, I couldn't help but think that it was another version of the Sissy Spacek movie ""Carrie."" And, while I willing suspended disbelief at the supernatural elements of the story, I found the lack of supervision in the town's high school unbelievable, especially in this day and age when administrators are living in the shadow of Columbine. The bullies were allowed to pester other children without any hall monitors in sight. They were able to enter and leave the building at will (even in the late afternoon). Maybe it's because I'm a retired teacher that I was annoyed at this lack of verisimilitude."
3,Just like The Unwanted,"Is it me or is this book just like The Unwanted? Both have a teenage boy and girl, both have at least one abusive or alcoholic parent and both have a cat. The troubled young teenagers who are unpopular and get bullied by their classmates are very tiresome. Admittedly these are the first 2 John Saul books I've read, but now I'm reluctant to read more if they're going to be about the poor teenagers that are misunderstood and are followed by a cat."
3,"Starts Slow, Ends Good But Still Falls Short","I thought maybe, when I picked up this book, that John Saul might be able to break away from his mold. But as usaul this book is as formulated as all his others. Abandoned house, small town with dark secrets, outcast teens, and etc. It seems redundant to read the same book over and over, with just small changes. The ending was pretty gruesome but predictable. It was all pretty much predictable. I like John Saul's books, but ever since The Presence, they have been so overly predictable."
2,Overly bad end,"At first the book is really thrilling. But as you keep reading it gets long, boring, ineffectual and of course not eerie. At first I have to tell you that's spooky but after you get inside the book instead of eerie it gets jesty.For example:In this book you'll learn how to play golf and pool. But if you want to learn that you'll buy other kind of books.You'll get spooky at first. But all the eerie things are dreams so after three or four you'll laugh at them.And the worst of all is the end. Why? Because after all the struggling and scrambling of the kids to stay cool and away of their foes they just loose everything they've done just because. Why didn't they go to the concealed shed?And just to keep going don't read the epilogue it's really wimp."
2,Black Creek Crossing,This book read more like a short story. The character development of the families was totally inadequate. I would like to know more about the Wynton family and why they were burned as witches? What about the father of Forbearance? There was so little background that it was hard to get into the story. If John Saul would write a sequel and explain the history more; I would really enjoy that. Perhaps a hidden diary? I was very dissapointed. This could have been an excellent book!
2,Not the best one,"As other reviewers mentioned, the first 100 sides are thrilling. After that it becomes slowly and boring.You know what will happen that's what made the whole book very long-winded.Maybe because I've seen a few movies which had the same story line.J. Saul tells a true story about young people outstanding which made them to outsiders, teased by classmates. That's a true message. ;-)The other part was fiction, boring and not on his usual high level of fascinating readers like me."
3,Back to the Early Days of John Saul,"I have been a fan of John Saul's books for many years but found that his ""children in peril"" theme was getting a little stale.I was pleased to see that he was changing his style with his previous two novels ""Midnight Voices"" and ""Manhattan Hunt Club"", both of which I gave 5 stars.In ""Black Creek Crossing"", he is back to his old style and I am rather disappointed. This is so similar to his older books, that I thought I was re-reading one of them! Although this is not a bad story, hopefully Mr. Saul will continue to address adults in peril suspense and not totally regress to his previous type of story."
2,"Keeps your interest, but then disappoints at the end.",I found this book to be interesting until the last few chapters. It almost seems as though the author tired of writing the book and decided to just wrap everything up quickly at the end. I was so disappointed that after reading this book for hours that the ending just didn't satisfy.
2,Not the Greatest,"While fascinating in subject matter, this story has many inconsistencies and loose ends. The ending with regard to Angel and Seth is strange and doesn't make sense. I don't feel that I wasted my time in reading it, but on the other hand, I wasn't totally satisfied that it was as good as Mr. Saul's previous books."
2,Poorly written,"I did not like this book at all. The writing was horrible and the plot was simplistic. After I managed to finish the book, I wondered ""What has happened to John Saul?"". (...)"
2,Not his best work,"I've been reading John Saul's books since I was a teenager. I think perhaps I would have liked this one better back then. The writing style and plot seemed very juvenile to me, along the lines of an R.L. Stine book. Younger fans might enjoy this book, but it didn't hold my interest at all. Toward the end of the book, I was scanning through paragraphs quickly just to filter out the main plot and get it over with."
2,"This story was much better when Stephen King wrote it and called it ""Carrie""","This a horror story without much horror. The hauntings are strictly pro forma, as are the obligatory abusive parents and school bullies. ""Black Creek Crossing"" has few original story elements, and even the spirit-infested house has few descriptions worthy of even a tingle.The two teenaged protagonists are your typical picked-on outcasts who spend most of the book being tormented alternately at school and at home, until they discover witchcraft and start dishing out payback. The rest of the story proceeds in utterly predictable fashion.No thrills, no chills, and it was hard to feel sorry for any of the characters. The ending was straight out of any Hollywood made-for-sequels horror movie. I can't recommend this book unless you're looking for a lightweight and completely forgettable horror novel."
1,I can't believe I bothered to finish this...,"This was one of the worst books I've read in a while. The teenagers were not realistic in their actions and characterization, and the main protagonist was mopey and annoying. Just about all the adults were hateful in some way -- in reality, the real ""evil"" in this book is not the spirit haunting the house, but the alive people within the community...and the sad thing is, I don't think Saul wrote it to be that way.The ending is abrupt and not satisfying; some things don't make sense within the story and are never explained; the teenagers act and speak in a way that modern teens don't; and the ""scares"" really aren't all that scary and have been done by other, better writers. Don't waste your time on this book; I certainly wish I hadn't!"
4,horror,"Don't read any of Sauls books if you don't like like books that are a little spooky. But if you do like them , as I do all John Sauls books are excellent. two thumbs up!"
1,Terrible,"Boring, tooooooo long, no character development and a rotten ending. A rating of one star is too high."
1,Hated this book -still hate the author,"I read one of Saul's books about 15 years ago, I hated it, but somehow I convinced myself to try this one. Never again. I mean it this time."
2,Yawn.,"Nickel Creek fans, obviously, will love this syrupy solo album by the guitarist of the aforementioned famed popgrass fusion band. Presumably this mostly-instrumental outing is intended to demonstrate Watkins' chops as a picker, yet it follows so closely in the saccharine tradition of Nickel Creek that it doesn't do much to differentiate his work from theirs. The album opens with ""Neo's Song,"" which sounds like a watered-down version of Tony Rice's note-bending flatpicking style; the rest of the album gets progressively muzak-ier and Windham Hill-ish. Watkins has lots of technical facility, but his artistic instincts are hopelessly bland."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"I bought this CD hoping to get a lot of good bluegrass instrumental work, I was disappointed. Some of the songs such as #1 Neo's song, had plenty of good elements but were just a little too long for my tastes (#4 Ferdinand the Bull was another of these)The one track with vocals, #2 Let it Fall, I didn't care for the lyrics but think the music was good to the extent that I could hear it.I thought that The Birth (#6), The Ant and the Ant (#7)and Nostalgic (#9) were the best tunes on the CD although Nostalgic seemed a little long to me.Reading the liner notes you'll find mention of a bonus track, it's hidden at the end of #10 Over the Waterfall. That selection is listed as 7 min 58 sec., the first few minutes are pretty good I thought, then comes a long minute or so of silence followed by a jazz(?) or something track that has nothing to do with the style of anything else on this CD."
4,IMO much better than his later solo albums,"As a guitarist who listens to a wide variety of music, I try to appreciate music for what it is, rather than what I want it to be. This album has many musical elements that make it an enjoyable acoustic album: outstanding playing, great melodies, very good arrangements, and good production. Someone mentioned that it could be a Windham Hill album, and so what? There's a lot of good music on that label for those with open minds and open ears. Overall, this album is much better than Sean's later solo albums. Those are basically pop albums that don't adequately display his guitar playing and songwriting abilities."
3,"Technically adept, but sterile","No shortage of virtuosity on this album, but where's the heart? Track after track displays musicianship and technique, but I found it very hard to connect with most of the songs."
5,This is a masterpiece,"Obviously if you like Nickel Creek, you'll absolutely love this. Sean Watkins is really an amazing artist. His talents weren't revealed as much as I would have liked on the Nickel Creek CD, but here he's had the chance to really shine.I would recommend this to anyone of any age. My personal favorites are Let It Fall, Cloudbreak, and January 2, but every one of his songs holds so much beauty and magic.With a mesmerizing blend of different instruments, there are highs and lows, exciting climaxes and soothing lulls. These songs tell stories, even without words."
2,"So many prefaces, so little annotation","There are some wonderful editions of 'Annotated Hunting of the Snark' out there, but this isn't one of them.It has preface before preface before preface. To the point where you start to get bored before getting to the meat of the book.It has the 'story' proper in ordinary sized, black type face. But the annotation is in light red (not pink, but washed out red) very small print. Hard to read.And the beloved illustrations are not very closely placed to their mention in the book.You better have lots of patience and very good eyesight if you buy this edition of a classic book.Just my opinion."
1,"Look for the ""live"" Paris Concert CD instead","This CD is only good if you're not looking to listen what Nusrat had to offer, that what you need is a rhythm accompanation for doing arobic or Yoga exercise. If you are serious about listening to good and real NFAK Quawwali chants, rather than Disco beat, go to the 5CD set of NFAT live in concert in Paris.That is the bliss of real NFAK's music."
4,An alternative view of what psychiatry calls mental illness,"I first read this book ten years ago and instanlty loved it. I took my time about buying a copy, and it went out of print. I'm correcting that mistake today! The book is about a boy who, from time to time, experiences what modern mainstream psychiatry would call psychotic events (not to imply that those people could ever agree upon a diagnosis). He has had contact with social services and the mental health profession...no luck. He then runs into a native shaman. One of the definitions of ""shaman"" in the dictionary I have here is: one who ""divines the hidden."" The shaman teaches the boy that his episodes are not symptoms of mental illness, but symptoms of being one of ""the chosen."" If you think street people are crazy, if you think crazy people should be at least fixed, and probably locked-up in the process, if you own stock in the drug company which make lithium...this book my help."
1,This book has the worst ending ever!,This is the worst possible book that they could be giving to teenagers to read. It simply teaches them that if things are not going there way then they can always kill themselves. This is not the sort of thing that schools should be premoting
5,Puppy Steps,My two dauchsands use their steps everyday. The quality is excellant. Works great for high beds.
5,Exxcellent Book For Aspiring Romance Writers,I found this book to be very useful for romance writers. It contains much insight to the writing genre. I have been writing for about 10 years and I found information in this book that I didn't know. I would highly recommend this book to anyone writing romance.
2,Tough Going,"This book is supposed to be a good translation. I am not a Hindu, so I found the reading laborious. The translator, Valerie Roebuck, is an expert in her field. However, I didn't appreciate her truncating words just for authenticity. Hindu scriptures are difficult enough without making it worse. Maybe someone will write ""The Upanishads for Dummies."""
3,Childhood Memories,"My mother used this book as a college text book in the 1940's and as a reference book for in her classroom for 30 years as a first grade teacher. I first heard the stories and verse in the 1950's as she read from it to my sisters and me. In our unsophisticated childhood we all thought the poem, ""Little Orphant Annie"" by James Whitcomb Riley was the scariest thing that could happen to a child. Since the book was published in 1940 you won't find anything more recent in it, but that one volume with the tattered and threadbare cover is the only book my mother, now 82 years old, possesses that my sisters and I all want. There may be too many good memories wrapped up in this book for me to be objective, but it is comprehensive for its time and you will find the classic verses here."
1,hate it quailty is bad,my son was skating for christmas and the skate had torn from the boot part of the skate it havent been a 1 week and its already torn
4,Great Bedtime Reading,"My two girls, ages 5 and 3, love listening to a prayer a night before going to bed. I would suggest also getting the companion 365 Stories a Night to read before the prayer book. The two complement each other, telling a story and then hearing the prayer is like a recap of the main idea or teaching from the story. There are no pictures so it is a book for parents/ grandparents to read to the child. It is a nice way for the children to learn the Bible in a style they can grasp and understand."
3,Looks good on a picture,"The over all quality of this product deserves 5 stars, however, the fact that the bottom part of the jacket is almost as wide as shoulders (sleeves included) ruins the entire picture. I realize that we get what we payed for, but I did not pay for a skirt...Updated: Proved to be rather durable and essentially worm over these years, however, the excessively wide bottom allowing too much cold air in is a major problem. Given a choice, I wouldn't purchase this item again."
4,AGMC At Their Best,Great holiday recording! AGMC is fine ensemble of 125 men. This recording shows them at their best.
4,Excellent resource for U. S. exporters of all sizes.,"This book provides valuable information on the social, political, economic and marketing aspects of the 40 major trading partners (countries) of the United States. It rates the credit worthiness of each country based upon its trade and monetary policies, climate for foreign investment, import duties and taxes, political climate, and attitude towards protection of intellectual property rights. It does an excellent job of addressing the cultural aspects of doing business abroad. Our staff uses it often as a resource for conducting international market research and working with consulting clients. Recommended for purchase by John R. Jagoe, Director, Export Institute"
5,Dream Town Rose Petal Cottage,"I bought the Dream Town Rose Petal Cottage for my 4-1/2years old Grandaghter she just loved it,only one problem she can't get her 1-1/2 sister out off the cottage she fits perfectly in the cottage and wouldn't come out,she'll play in the cottage for hours!!!!"
5,If I were little I'd be in there too!,I have two girls (5 and 2 years old) that both LOVE this. It wasn't that difficult to assemble and taking hints from previous reviews we took our time and carefully assembled the frame. It was a little confusing at the part where you have to undo the zipper by the door then zip it on the other side of the metal frame but once we were past that it seemed simple. They have dubbed it their 'clubhouse' and really enjoy it.
4,good for the money,My kids (1 and 3) absolutely LOVE this! The only problem is that they can and like to take them and put them in their sides and play in it. It does have a tendancy to topple over when they put the two sides together to enclose the cottage. But they have had hours of imaginary play in it!
5,Absolutly lovely!!!!,"my baby of 20 months old loves this cottage, the price that I bought was the best, I should recommend this toy for children from 12 months and up, imagine you, my baby is only 20 months and she seems too big for the cottage (maybe she si too tall for her ageand we are tall) even its more or less big, I recommend it too much.P.D: Never leave your child alone, dont put the cottage near or next to walls, the cottage is delicated but durable if you try it well. Its a little bite complicated to emssable but all the time worths, my baby its happy."
2,Easy to put together? You have to be joking...,"Supposedly this is ""easy"" to put together..sure teh frame is easy and as long as you have about 8 hands to help with the cloth part for on top, a genius IQ to figure out the picture directions, I'm sure thats helpful but doing it on your own, forget it. I'm still trying to figure it out and sitting here frustrated after an HOUR of velcroing these pieces to the frame to have it look weird...its not fitting right. My kids have knocked over my attempts, putting it together a few times and for the moment while i sit here and type this out of sheer frustration the annoyingness of it all, I threw a sheet over the thing and they are just as happy with that. Haven't even attempted the stove, nor do I really want to at this point...anyone want this ""fun"" toy?? I'll gladly ship it off to another person who wants to deal with it."
2,Review after 6 months,My opinion of the product+ Durable and easy to set up+ large enough for both my girls to play in comfortably-The add on products are very not very good. They may look cool but they are not as durable (always falling apart) and are not much fun for the kids to play with-This toy takes up way to much room-Even put in the stored postition it still takes up a lot of roomMy girls loved this for about the first 2 weeks. Since they have totally lost interest. I believe that with better accesories it would be very good. They are not durable and really do not encourage play.The house is very durable and well made.
4,watch the insructions on line before you assemble,"It is very cute for my granddaughter she seems to like it and the wall are durable but true to form my husband and my son-in-law thought it would be easy to assemble. An instuction on line was available but we did not watch it sooooooooooooooo it took my daughter, son-in-law, my son, my younger daughter, her boyfriend, my husband and me to figure it out. We have 39 years of college between us."
5,Wonderful!,"I am so glad I didnt listen to the bad reviews on this. This toy is great! As far as educational goes - no but my kids love it! I have a 4 1/2 year old and an 18 month old and they play for hours. They use it as a fort, a house, an office, school. It's fun and different and very durable!"
5,Great Cottage,We bought the rose petal cottage and accessories for my daughter who just turned 2. (I know that it is for children 3 and up) but she absolutely loves it. My son is 3 and plays with it as well. The furniture is very easy to assemble...the house wasn't too difficult to assemble either. I would recommend this for any little girl ages 2 and up.
3,Not what I was hoping for,"This cottage is very pretty, however the durability is NIL. It fell apart within a couple months and my daughter was so dissapointed when I had to throw it away due to matters of safety... Waste of money"
2,Fell apart fast!,"I bought this Cottage as a birthday gift for my 3-year old daughter. It was NOT EASY to assemble. You have to essentially ""build"" the frame with dozens of pipes and connectors then you have to pull the fabric cover pretty tight over the frame while zipping it up at the same time. Kind of annoying.My high-energy daughter was quickly bored with it except for using it to hide in during tag. After some rowdy play in and around the Cottage with friends, half of it was eventually ruined. The connector pieces for the frame broke and the fabric lining collapsed. We had to toss it out in the trash. (The other half sits in the basement and no one seems remotely interested in playing in it.)If you have a rough and tough, energetic kid, then this toy is definitely not for them. If you have a sweet, gentle kid who likes to sit quietly and play tea party with her dolls, then it is. (And as of this date, I saw the Cottage at Toys'R'Us for $15 on sale!)"
5,perfect for a princess,"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter for Christmas and it was very easy to set up and it is big enough for her to play in. She has spent countless hours at play with it. I was worried where I was going to store it, but she hasn't stopped playing with the cottage long enough for me to worry about it. Plus, you can put the two halves together and it takes up half the space. It is so cute looking it is a great decorating accent to any little girl room."
5,great entertainment for little girls!,my 4 year old daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it. I think it's a great toy to get because you can also add on to it. My daughter loves to have her little brother (and me!) in there for tea time!
4,No complaints,"Bought the house for my 2 yr old niece. She loves it! It's a really good size for her to have enough space in there that she can still move around. My son, daughter, nephew and niece all managed to fit in there too. The material seems pretty durable. It's not the flimsy plastic that is on other playhouses. The only thing my sister mentioned is that there is a lot of pieces when you put it together..but she said it was worth it."
3,Falls short of the same toy sold in Britain,"The problem I'm having with buying this toy is that we originally saw it in Britain and then went looking for it over here in the U.S. We found it here, but not exactly the same. The one sold in Britain from places like the Early Learning Center, is at least 3 inches bigger all around and also has a much cuter look to it with the little peak above the door. Of course, to buy in dollars rather than pounds, would cost the earth so I'll probably settle with the American version. Just disappointed that it had to be made much cheaper in look and dimension."
4,cute play house for younger girls,"The house is a cute idea, It is made to leave open I wish it fit together better to make a house thats how my daughter likes it.I bought it super cheep on sale and free shipping so I think it was worth getting.Over all it's nice, but it's for realy young girls like 3ish and under."
4,great toy house for the price,Got this on sale & free shipping for my 3 yr old for xmas. She really likes it. It was easy to put together. and light and easy to move around. The two sides can fix into each other and don't take up much space (compared to other playhouses)
2,I WOULD NOT SPEND MORE THAN $40 FOR THIS!!!,"SO ADORABLE!!! BUT, OUR ARRIVED WITH FAULTY STITCHING AND THE PINK SIDE COVER WOULD NOT FIT. HAD TO CUT IT ACROSS THE BOTTOM TO PUT IT ON. WILL BE CALL HASBRO IN THE A.M. BESIDES THAT, THE MATERIAL FOR THE ACCESSORIES ARE AWESOME@@ I HOPE M LITTLE ONE LOVES IT!!!"
1,Nightmare to put together,"This may be a fun product ONCE it is put together, but putting the cottage together is a nightmare, and took both me and my husband forever.The cover was not going over the frame how the instructions showed.The rest of the stuff was easy, but the cottage was a nightmare.Hopefully once it is put together the kids will enjoy playing with it."
4,great play house,"This rose petal cottage is so adorable, Its not that tall so you child must sit or kneel in it which must kids do anyway, easy to move from room to room cause its light weight. The adorable design and colors are so cute and sweet. The stove and washer which we have also fit great inside, I used my own table and chairs . Once again amazon dropped the price to 29.99 I couldnt believe my eyes, I ordered it and returned the one I already brought from walmart for 89.00. A must have for your princess play...."
5,Her Very Own Cottage,"I bought this cottage for my 3yr. old for Christmas. She absolutely loves it. We store some of here baby strollers, etc. in this cottage when she is not using it. She loves to hide in it and go in and out of the door. When her 3 and 6 yr. old cousins come over, they love to play in it too. I have read some reviews that the outside (fabric) is hard to put on the frame. You just have to make sure everything is lined up correctly. Overall this was a great investment (I got it on sale for 1/2 price on amazon.com just a little before christmas). Next, we are looking for the sink as this is replacing her kitchen set!"
5,My Grandaughter loves this!,"We bought this for my grandaughter for Christmas, she is not quite two yet and she loves playing in this house! It is easy to move around and you can place one side in the other for storage so it doesn't have to take up a whole room.I can easily see her playing in it for a few years."
4,hasbro playschool dream,"kids love it, kinda flimsy, even an idiot can assemble in 5 minutes, if the kids play the big bad wolf and three little pigs a few more times, it may go the way of the stick house. It was way better than the straw one for the same price and time to assemble."
3,SO Difficult!,"This house is really cute and could be fun, but it takes FOREVER to put together. It was very difficult and aggravating to put together. The directions are awful. But once (if) you finally figure it out, it is a lot of fun for the little one to play with. It also is kinda flimsy. You have to prop it up against a wall or something because otherwise, if the little one leans on it, she will fall right over."
4,fun for all!,"I bought this on a whim because of a good deal, and all three of my kids love it. 5 year old daughter and 3 year old son play in there for long stretches and my 8 months old liked to crawl around in it too!I was a little difficult to put together, but there is a video online that helps a lot. I like that I can nest the two sides together and get more room when we need to."
4,Rose Pedal Cottage,I purchased this product on sale which makes me more satisfied with this product. Both of my kids love playing inside the house. It does take up a lot of space but it is worth it if you have room. It was tricky to put together but it seems durable and easy to move around. It is also lightweight and safe.
3,I Hope This DVD Will Do The Movie Justice!,"I see that a new DVD for the George C. Scott version of Jane Eyre is being released on October 25, 2005. So far all of the other DVD's for the Jane Eyre movie starring Suzannah York and George C. Scott have been crappy public domain copys and they have been edited and have had at least 10 to 20 minutes missing from the movie so hopefully this new DVD will have better picture quality will restore the movie to it's original length! But seeing as the DVD is priced cheaply at $4.99 it will probably be another cheaply made public domain quality DVD!"
3,So So,"This DVD comes in a pack like those ""dollar"" DVD's. It says it was digitally remastered. Nope. Image is dark, lack-luster, color ain't real great."
2,Maybe Ya Hadda Be There,"As a Jane Eyre fan, I thought it would be fun to watch an earlier version of this film. But there may be a generation gap at work here. Not only was the film dark and hard to ""see,"" but for me, Joan Fontaine (or perhaps more particularly, her hair) reminded me of the women who used to go to the beauty parlor for a weekly set and style ""way back when."" George C. Scott looked like (pardon me) a portly retired sea captain. The early scenes of Lowood School capture the horror of Jane's childhood well, but Joan Fontaine and George C. Scott seem far too geriatric to play these particular romantic roles. Perhaps in thirty years, our ""contemporary"" version may look as goofy to the next generation, but for now, I'd recommend the current version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens in the lead roles. Although that version has its own sillinesses, it seems to capture the overall psychology of the characters and atmosphere of the book quite well."
5,I like it very much. It had a ...,I like it very much. It had a good taste. Not too minty. I would recommend it.
5,Absolutly Awsome!!,"Kerry is one of the most amazing performers I have seen in a long time. Fabulous voice, excellent lyricist and wonderful stage presence. All of it comes through on this recording! I loaned it (briefly) to several of my friends and had trouble getting it back every time! Kerry's music is like a breath of fresh air through the tired, formulaic, corporate maisma of today's pop artists. This is no doubt some of the wisest money you could spend on music. Also, she is fabulous in person and a real sweetheart, so if you live in SoCal or are visiting try and catch one of her shows - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Little Victory is BIG VICTORY!,Kerry again shows off her song writing ability and her hypnotic voice. I highly recommend this CD!!
1,Tom's WAS great.,"Most minty toothpastes feel like they burn my mouth. This one doesn't do that, and the flavor is pleasant. Also, no yucky fluoride.My local stores rarely carry this, opting instead to stock the ""burn your mouth with mint or cinnamon"" varieties. I've been using Tom's un-fluoridated toothpaste for over ten years.These tubes are 5.5 ounces, not 6 ounces as the listing shows. The truth about fluoride [...]Well, this used to be a good toothpaste, but the Tom's brand was bought out,and now it tastes like mush,and has ingredients in it that interfere with what a good natural toothpaste is supposed to do. At least it doesn't have fluoride.I've now switched to EcoDent tooth powder."
4,Cohens stroy is all over the map...and beyond.,"I have always hungered for an adventure that was ambigious enough that I would be forced to complete it in order to unravel the mystery. Clayton Smith left Andy Mann just such an adventure. Although Clayton Smith is a dead character, he is the most interesting character in the book. Even at the end, I was not convinced that he was really dead; like Elvis and Jim Morrison, I can readily imagine folkore explanations about how he still lives. Read Invisible World and you will find out that Inner Mongolia has more dimensions than shown on the map."
4,"Stuart Cohen, the next Dick Francis?!","Invisible World is a thriller of the Dick Francis genre. I love a book that has a compelling plot, AND lets me into an otherwise obscure world. In this case, its the world of rare and exotic textile traders...and um...smugglers! Cohen weaves a web that kept me up late and fascinated by his Invisible World. You'll feel like you're in on the journey to South America, China, and Inner Mongolia as you read this great first book."
5,Elijah is one of the best!,When you finish reading this book you will have a very good outline of Elijah's life. It is easy reading but detailed in content. I have bought several of these for friends and family.
1,Poor construction,"The content of the book is excellent. Pink is one of my favorite Bible teachers and commentators. I highly recommend the content.However, I was extremely disappointed when I opened the book to begin reading and the pages started falling out!"
2,Black marks!,So I thought this would be better than the older model....six black rubber wheels in stead of four....it turns out that it leaves black streaks on your hard wood floor unless you are careful to only go back and forth in motion....any sideways movement makes a mess....spent some time on my knees with the magic eraser cleaning up after I vacuumed....how disappointing!
1,Hold off buying,"This is a reprinting of an old book in the Tran series. I enjoyed the series, but there is no evidence that the series will every be continued, much less concluded. At least wait until a new book appears. Too bad since the series otherwise worthwhile, but this is one of too many examples where series never get finished. Why get invested in a series if the author and publisher will never get to the end?"
4,A great magazine,"American girl is great magazine for your 8 to 11 year old. Filled with helpful advice, clever tips on parties, and real stories about real girls this magazine is perfect. My daughter loved this magazine when she was younger. Once your daughter hits 12 or 13, you might want to try a magazine such as YM or Girl's Life, for with my daughter she became interested in boys and fashion. Overall, for you daughter's late elementary years, this is a wonderful magazine."
4,Wonderful and Great!,"I am 12 and I love this magazine! It has quizzes, HELP from you, moneymakers, and more! I think that any pre-teen would like this magazine.The only thing I did not like was the long, long stories."
1,American Girl,Ordered. Paid for. Order acknowledged. NEVER RECIEVED any issues. Wrote inquiry. NEVER got an answer.
1,THE MAGAZINE HAS NOT EVEN BEEN SENT YET!,"How can you ask me to rate this magazine when you told me that you won't be able to deliver it until December 2010???????????? I am almost sorry that I ever ordered it since I had told someone that I'd order it for them. They got all excited and then really disappointed when they found out that it would take a couple of months until they'd even get the first issue. Had I known that it would take you so long to get it out I'd probably not even have bothered! Sorry to say but since you asked me for my review, here it is."
2,Oh come on!,"I used to be a suscriber to AG for about two years and I look back at it now, this mag is way too superficial. I have never tried any of the parties(they are lame anyway) AG just doesn't understand that regular girls in America just don't have time for their lame parties. Another reason why I can't stand this mag is the advice in the Help! column. Okay, they make the person feel like losers, and I've noticed that if something happens with someone's friend, and it's the friend's fault, it's like the people giving the advice make it seem like the person has to bow down to their friend. ???? Horrible advice. Just horrible. The short stories most of the time are badly written. The whole time I subscribed to this garbage, there has only been two or three stories I enjoyed, but most of them were stupid.Basically, this magazine does not inspire girls. It just dumbs them down."
1,PERFECT For 6-11 year olds,"When i wuz 9 and just started getting this mag i loooooved it BECAUSE it was perfect (age-appropriate) for my age and my parents liked it because of that. But now i'm 13 and i still have a subscription to AG but i know that as soon as this subscription ends i'm NOT renewing because i feel waaaaaaay too old for this magazine it seems very pointless and boring to me now,so i think that this mag is perfect for 6-11 year olds. If ur 12-15 yrs old try GL, I have it and think its the perfect teen alternative magazine.I really hope that u preteens realize that this mag is way too young for you, don't mean to insult u, but GROW UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,American magazine is babish!,"This magazine is fairly Babish! I am ten years old, none of my friends likes this babish magazine neither the girls in my class!!!! I would recommend this magazine for eight year olds! If your ten years old or older I would say not to get this magazine! The magazine does have crafts and some quizzes and other stuff. PARENTS YOU SHOULD PURCHASE THIS MAGAZINE FOR YOU EIGHT OR NINE YEAR OLD. Plus there is no inapprotient stuff in this magazine!"
1,THE WORST MAGAZINE EVER IS AMERICAN GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really, really, really used to like American Girl, but over the years, I have seen the quality of the stuff decrease by as much as 70%. Who would want to pay $5.34 PER ISSUE!!?? Not me!!!!!! My family only has enough ADDITIONAL money to get Consumer Reports magazines for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! American Girl magazines are only for people who have lots and lots and lots of friends, AND have a rich family, AND who do not have Asperger's Syndrome, because I have Asperger's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good...I think..,"I've gotten this magazine since 1998, I've finally grown out of it. Just recently I switched to Girl's Life and like better. AG has lots of crafts, games, parties, and stuff about being your self. This magazine is published by the people who sell American Girl dolls, but they don't advertise that in the magazine. A great magazine for 7 to 11/12."
4,Good magazine for girls aged 8-10,"Parents, if you are finding a magazine which doesn't focus on fashion, beauty, boys, and your little girl is aged 8-10, then I suggest you to buy this magazine.This magazine is good because it covers pets to parties to real girl articles. It has no sexual, beauty and other things that you don't wish to be seen by your daughter.For girls aged 12 or above, this magazine may be a little too girly for them, as they are now in high school, they might be having crushes, puberty and other embarrasing moments. If your girl is 12 or older, then I highly recommend you to Discovery Girl. It's a magazine filled with interesting articles in a helpful way for your children, embarrasing moments, and it also covers you a bit of fashion.American Girl and Discovery Girl or both very good magazines,if you are not still sure what's good for your child, I suggest you to buy an issue of both magazines first."
4,#1 Best,"This is one of my favorite mag that i subscribe. I love the games, party ideas,puzzles, crafts and real stories. So what if there is no stuff about purberty or boys, there are other magazine's out there that have that stuff like Girl's Life (which I do recomend for girls 12-16). I am 11 years old and I have been getting American Girl for three years now!I love that you get to take part in the issue like the art gallery or the contests. The reason why I gave it 4 stars was because you only get 6 issues a year and the price is a whooping $22.50! But over all this is a great mag for girls almost all ages!"
5,Wonderful Magazine for Girls!,"I've been getting this magazine for 3 years, and I LOVE it! It doesn't focus on drugs, boys, etc. but is more of a ""girl power"" magazine. It includes crafts, food recipes, true life stories, advice, and how to fight boredom! It includes things to do every day, and sometimes gives an address for a movie star. (i.e. Hilary Duff) I don't think I'll ever cancel this subscription!"
1,AMERICAN GIRL IS DUMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"American Girl is lame because they think bimonthly issues are excellent??????? THEY'RE NOTTT!! They think: OK, this is only for wealthy American girls. and they make it so the magazine is boring and the website is boring. THEY'RE LIKE HERBERGERS and i hate herbergers!!!!!!!!! I like teletubbies WAAAAAAAAYYYYYBETTER!!!!"
4,Great But....,"It's a great magazine but it's not really about American Girl Dolls which I love. And it's really expensive for a 40 page magazine. But it's still fun to read and a lot of crafts in this magazine. I wish they could make it a little better and add more stuff to it. They always waste their pages with party plans, stories etc..."
2,"Good for 8 year olds, maybe 9 year olds, but not older","This is a magazine good for 8 year olds, maybe 9 year olds, but if you are say, 10, 11, or 12, this magazine is boring. It doesn't have any realistic advice about school, boys, etc. It is a lot of stuff you usually aren't interested in at this age, like crafts, etc. Only a few articles are good. If you aren't exactly ready for a teen zine, but want something slightly more grown up, try Discovery Girls."
2,OH MY GOD!,Oh My GoD tHiS mAgAzInE iS lIkE sO gOoD!This magazine is boring! I for one am a young girl and I like Teen People more! American Girl is just crafts and how to get along with your siblings. Nothing about boys or any cute boys! I recommend GL or Teen instead of American Girl.
2,NOT for 12 year olds!,"American Girl says it is for ages 8-12. I seriously think it should be ages 7-9 or 10. First of all, the magazine is only 6 issues a year for $23! I don't know about you, but I think that's a waste! Plus, the magazine only has 49 pages! Also, American Girl doesn't really have things girls in the older age range care about- fashion, quizzes with real meaning, and stuff like that. It seems all we ever do is make crafts, make parties, cook, look through the magazine in less than half an hour, and so on. If you have a daughter who thinks she wants this magazine, think again! It's like throwing away money and this magazine has no form of education in it. Basically the staff is trying to make sure that 7 year olds enjoy it without adding in the stuff 12 year olds like. NOT for 12 year olds, and NOT a good combination!"
3,It's okay,"I have read this magazine before and have never really liked it. I think the quizes are pointless, and set people into just one label.But I think that it's good for the younger kids, because it's got the kind of stuff 8-10 year olds would enjoy."
3,Subscription took TOO long to get.,The magazine was a gift to grand daughter and ordered in October. She just now got the magazine in January. NO ONE else takes this long to start a subscription. Very disappointed in your subscription services. Need to speed it up.
3,Pros and Cons,"My name is Kelsey and I am twelve years old. I subrscribe to American Girl, and here is what I think of the magazine.Pros:1.) Fun crafts to do2.) Tips for ""grooming"" your bedroom3.) Advice column4.) It has alot on friends5.) Alot on parties6.) Appropraite for all childrenCons:1.) Too short (Most are less than 70 pages)2.) Expensive to subscribe to3.) The crafts usually require alot of materials4.) The party ideas are often unrealistic or uncommon (Asian themed party, Monkey themed party, Country themed party, the list goes on...)5.) The magazine only comes out every other month6.) There isn't enough on fashion, makeup, health, boys, TV, movies (It dosen't have what typical magazines have)Overall, I think this magazine is perfect for girls ages 7-11. If you want a teen magazine, try Teen People, Teen Vogue or Seventeen."
1,No True,This is not a true rating because this magazine was ordered for my grandaughter and has not been recieved yet.
4,haven't gotten it yet,Haven't gotten this subscription yet. Apparently it takes about 6 weeks to get. We've gotten this magazine before and my girls love it. Very clean and age appropriate.
5,Are we too old for this?,"i think that you can be any age too read american girl. I am almost 14 years old and i still read it faithfully. Some of my friends dont read it anymore because it is too young fot them,but i still think i will read it when i am older too! it may not give tips on boys or makeup but if you are looking for these things, you should read another magazine. I also think you shouldnt be preasured into reading more adult magazines, I have and i just dont give into it. No matter what anyone says american girl is a good magazine and kids and teens of all ages should read it!"
4,Grown out of Magazine.....,"I'd gotten a subscription for 3 years! I thought the magazine was okay because you only get it once every two months (6 per year) and theres only about 50 pages! But, if you like advice on boys and make-up look at ym, twist or seventeen! This magazine does have great stories, and advice from girls from age 6-13! I think march/April issue is the best because if you like animals pick it up NOW its ALL about animals! I recommend this for ages 6-13 and maybe older than 6 if you need help reading or if you read with your mom this is the magazine for you!"
2,For Younger Kids,"I used to be subscribed to this magazine when I was about 11 years old. Back then it was really interesting but after I turned 12 I wanted to read magazines that had more stuff about things like celebrities and make up, and American Girl doesn't have that. They do, however, have a lot of different crafts and recipies that younger kids under 12 will enjoy. I think that after your kid turns 12 you should subscribe them to a different magazine like Discovery Girls which will be more suitable for them, and have more things directed at their age group, and things that will probably interest them more. Either way, American Girl is still a good magazine!"
3,AG's..okay-ish...,"I got this magazine when I was 9 and I really liked it....then. I think the people writing it think all of their subscribers are rich, cute popular, mini-Miss America girls. The party ideas are stupid (I've never EVER thrown a party using their ideas) I wish they would have more real stories with real people and also celeb stuff. Anyways, your girl might like it, but I advise you to look at other maagzines first"
5,Funny and Real!,This book is the closest thing to the truth about being pregnant! The authors hit the nail on the head by not making pregnancy and the birth such a science experiment. It's an enjoyable read and it tells you like it is.
4,A fun read with helpful information,"I really like this book. It counts down your pregnancy day by day, and each page has helpful information, especially for first time moms. At each new week, it tells you the approximate size and weight of your baby, and the rest of their development at that point. Each page provides you with tips and advice from doctor's and moms who have been there. I look forward to each new day, but it's hard not to read ahead! ;-) It's a very fun and easy read. With that said, this book throws out many random facts and 'tidbits' of information. It does not take the place of a true pregnancy guide that covers everything from fetal development to labor and delivery options, to newborn care. I think every woman expecting should have this book. My husband loves to read it too!"
4,Cute book,"I wouldn't have this book as my one and only pregnancy book, but it's a cute book with a lot of advice and antidotes. As I am a person that naturally counts down, this book has helped me keep on track and being excited about each day."
4,Cute little book,It's easy to read and has some funny little anecdotes. It's not serious material. I mean if you want something that addresses the many concerns pregnant women have it doesn't go into much detail about those. If you're looking for a cute little read with some writings you can relate to then this book is a gem.
3,Ho Hum,"The Good: There are some useful hints and there are quotes from experienced mothers offering good advice. It's encouraging to read that other mothers share your concerns.The Bad: Overall, there's very little actual information beyond a handful of tidbits. Some of the information seems outdated despite the fact that this is not an old book (this book implies that you have to buy a bassinet but the fact is you don't actually NEED one). Also, while the day-by-day layout of this book is interesting, it's not very practical. If you're looking for one specific issue, you'll have a hard time finding it.The Ugly: A lot of this book is written in a ""cutesy"" tone that I found annoying. When I'm looking for practical information the last thing I want to read is girly chit-chat.The bottom line is I'm a straightforward, matter-of-fact person and while this isn't a terrible book it's just not my kind of book. I recommend ""Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy"" and ""Baby Bargains"" instead of this book."
4,In my top 3 even if it it contains no pictures; reads smoothly,"The pregnancy countdown is in my personal top 3. I love the format of the book (light, small, 1 day of pregnancy=1 page). Helps you visualize your baby (mine's the size of a lemon right now), you get advice (usually coming from other moms and dads), a to do list (join a bulletin board), baby's activities (flipping, yawning, etc.) and so on. Reads very well. On the downside...no pictures at all."
4,"Fun, but not terribly informative","This is a cute little book. I enjoy reading it every morning (it has a daily countdown)and have fun with the little tidbits of advice and laughter. However, this is not a comprehensive pregnancy book, and doesn't have that much useful information in it. I probably wouldn't have bought it if I had realized what it actually was, but I still have fun reading it daily - it makes even the mundane a little fun."
5,Honest book!,"I love this book! It is so honest, even about the not so enjoyable things during pregnancy. There are quotes from actual mothers about things they experienced during pregnancy. I recommend this book to anyone who is pregnant or looking to become pregnant."
5,A great book to turn to during your pregnancy,"I bought this book when I first found out I was pregnant, and I enjoyed it the whole time. The author doesn't try to sugarcoat pregnancy, she tells it how it is, which is refreshing. I turned to different books for in-depth advice, but this is the book that I read the most."
4,Book,"Book arrived quickly and in great shape. It is a great read and helpful and interesting facts about pregnancy. The only blunder I have found so far in the book is that the length of the baby from 19, 20, and 21 weeks. 19 weeks says 6 and half inches then 20 weeks says 10 inches then the 21 week says 7 and a half so it confused me at first."
2,"Not for me, maybe for you.","This book is really ONLY for the first-time mom who has a corporate job. I happen to be pregnant with my second child, but it will have been 4 1/2 years since my first was born, so I was looking for a book with some refreshers about the little nuances of pregnancy (so many of which i have forgotten)! But rather than focusing on body changes, physical feelings, and helpful suggestions, it is more of a focus on navigating your way through your corporate job while being pregnant.If you fit the first-time-mom-with-corporate-job description, i bet you'll love this book!But as for me, I am disappointed that I spent the money on it."
3,Just Okay,"This book is just okay, I had a pretty normal pregnancy and had a hard time relating to this book in the begining. I felt it was pretty negative. I agree with the other reviews, it does have some good little tid-bits of information but if it's content you're looking for this book is not for you. It's a good reference between other books."
1,Full of useless information but cutesy,"To be completely honest, I found this book to be worthless. It's a tiny book filled with seemingly useless advice... some of which is the same advice that you will have already heard from your friends or family. The rest is common sense. If you want funny little random bits of advice or information and have some extra cash then this might be a fun read. I wanted actual information on pregnancy and useful advice. It was a let down."
2,Disappointed after such good reviews,I was disappointed by this book after reading such good reviews. It is full of opinions and personal advice but no real factual information.
2,Water Aerobic book,The book is older and dated. It was helpful in developing a list of routines for our class. The section on assessments and abilities was valuable. The lack of illustrations for the individual exercises was disappointing. I would rate the book at a 2.5 out of 5 stars. Compared to other books in the field it just is not as a board and helpful.
2,Manf overstates carrying capacity; photo shows optional siderails,"The Manufacturer grossly overstates the carrying capacity of this carrier. I had approximately 250 lbs on the carrier and bent the main support tube. If used as a light weight carrier, it is OK. Also, the manufacturer will not stand behind their product and replace under-designed parts. The manufacturer's picture depicts OPTIONAL side rails that are not included.."
3,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I just got this toy today but I am having a blast with it. It moves alot. lots of weapons. :)
3,"Economical choice, but the clips are a little annoying and full frames look better.","I went through a phase of buying a ton of these. They are very economical and they look fine, but really... get yourself an inexpensive frame with a mat. Sure you'll probably spent as much as 3x the money, but that's still only $30 and I can't tell you how much better your picture will look.For some isolated purposes (such as framing a simple map) they work VERY well.The clips tend to come flying off as you're assembling them and sometimes if you move them around or whatever. Just be careful you don't lose them.Sometimes the backing material is EXTREMELY cheap and has frayed cardboard bits that get everywhere and often wind up in front of your picture, which is VERY annoying. The lighter colored backing ones are much better, but it's random which one you get."
5,The most under-rated novel in American literature!,"This novel would be my selection for Most Ignored American Classic. It is a novel that totally transcends the mystery genre. Few serious students of American literature are familiar with Chandler; that's a shame. In England, he is often mentioned with Hemingway, Steinbeck, Faulkner, or Fitzgerald as a great American writer of the 20th century. Americans seem to dismiss him because his genre is not respected. That's the real crime!"
4,A masterpiece in its genre,"This must be one of the best crime novels I've ever read, even though I must say I'm not a big fan of the genre. The Long Goodbye was my second journey into Chandler (The Big Sleep being the first), and whereas I liked The Big Sleep quite much, it isn't a match for this. The story is brilliant, and Chandler allows it to develop slowly - not too many men with smoking guns this time. The characters are very rich. A suspense novel probably can't get much better than this."
5,THE LONG GOODBYE,"This book is excellent. Raymond Chandler is the king of gritty crime novels. I can see why his books translated so well into film noir black and white movies. His writing is wonderful. Almost lyrical. And quite witty and sarcastic. Also, written in the early 50's, one can see nothing much has changed in society. The rich,( and he does not point out any political party, they r both bad) rule! They rule the press and the police, etc. It's the everyday man that suffers the most. What else is new?? Look what is happening right now!!! Phillip Marlowe represents pretty much the everyday man and even woman, if one is cynical enough and has been burned a few times in their lives. I love the wise cracks sprinkled throughout the book. No need for me to go into the plot. That you can find out for yourself. I could not put the book down and read it in 2 days!"
4,The very noir-est,"One of the noir-est of the noir. Philip Marlowe, private detective. Lone wolf, paladin, man of honor. The usual philosophical drunks and women with ""mink[s] that almost made the Rolls-Royce look like just another automobile"". Crooked cops and crooks with a conscience.Terry Lennox's very rich, very nymphomaniac wife is found dead, her head bashed in. Lennox takes it on the lam to Mexico, and then is found dead with a bullet in his brain and a confession in front of him. But did he really do it? A lot of people want Marlowe to think so, and not to look into the case. But then he gets dragged into trying to save an alcoholic, best-selling novelist, and, as with any good noir novel, there's a connection.Also as in any good noir novel, nobody is what they seem or means what they say. Mysteries are ""solved"", but there are no tidy endings, no real heroes or villains. The atmosphere is all. And there is plenty of that here."
5,Best book ever? I really think so.,"I first read ""The Long Goodbye"" in 1976, before I had read any other Raymond Chandler novels. The book practically set off an explosion in my brain -- I have been fascinated by Chandler ever since. No other book by Chandler matches this one's emotional tone.This isn't a mystery novel, it is a great piece of literature. It is about friendship, love and betrayal. And the plot is complex and satisfying. Marlowe is defeated and in pain, and very, very alone.I have read ""Goodbye"" three times since 1977 -- most recently last year -- and every time I am just amazed at the effect the book has on me. It possibly just touches me personally, but I really believe it deserves a rating among the great books of all time."
5,Arguably Chandler's Best,"You don't read Raymond Chandler for the plots--you read him for the magnificent ""hard boiled"" prose. The Long Goodbye is probably his most complex work, full of world-weary insights and a somewhat more ""tender"" Marlowe. The great pleasure of The Long Goodbye is seeing how the main character, Philip Marlowe, reconciles his cynical view of humanity with a genuine desire to help a few unfortunates in life. The best Marlowe... classic....Donald Gallinger is the author of The Master Planets"
3,"Well written, but a little slow moving","The basics are detective Phillip Marlowe befriends a rich drunk. A short while later he helps the man escape to Mexico when he shows up on Marlowe's doorstep because something terrible has happened. Marlowe then ends up helping a man and wife who he finds out ran in the same circles as his friend and ultimately are involved in everything.I wanted to read this book because of its classic status in American literature and wanted to like it more than I did. Chandler is obviously a talented writer, but for some reason this book moved too slowly for me. I wasn't bored, but also wasn't completely enthralled."
2,Disappointing,"Long on atmosphere but short on plot and character development (save for the character of Marlowe himself), I couldn't wait to finish this novel and move on to something else.The surprise ending isn't much of a surprise, and Chandler's heavy-handed misogyny is distracting."
1,Overlong Goodbye,"I found the book tedious. I wasn't interested in the characters and I wasn't able to finish it. I realize that the genre style of detective novel was more or less created by Raymond Chandler and has inspired many, mostly second rank authors today. He does, of course, have an undeniable gift for description and he doesn't insult your intelligence, but the plotting of this book is dense, hard to follow and ,in general, is disappointing. The clicheed, dated wisecracking is hard to take, but that's just me, I guess. I just don't like the genre."
5,"More than 50 years later, still entertaining and relevant.","Yes, some of the language dates this, yet it is easily his greatest work and at risk of offending most literary types who disdain mystery novels, one of my choices as the ""Great American Novel.""It has all the essential elements; lust, greed, guilt, corruption, the insularity of the idle rich and the abuses of friendship and loyalty, all pricelessly narrated by the cynically observant Philip Marlowe."
4,coulda been five if there was more to read,"this is an excellent book for getting inspired to start a new healthy lifestyle, but i wish there was more than only 200 pages to read. Sly shoulda went more into his daily journal on what he does for the day, I thought that was very interesting. I couldn't put this book down."
5,Sly Guy,"I enjoyed the book. I've been a huge fan of Sly for years anyway. I just read on a blog that Sly is a fan of Roy Valentine (author of The System). Hey, both books are great and I'm a big fan of both guys as well."
5,priceless knowledge on achieving results,"sly has always cheered his fans on, saying if he could do it, anybody could, and in this book he clearly shares his knowledge on how to lose weight, get fit, build muscle, improve self esteem, and basically transform into a go getter. there are lots of full page photos of sly showing how specific excercises are done and includes descriptions and recommended reps. there's also a great section on eating healthy without compromising too much (without dieting). sly has written the book in a friendly way that makes one feel he/she is under the wing of a trusty mentor/friend. the book is inspiring and personal, and cuts straight to the important stuff that you'd hope to learn from such an extraordinary achiever. its rare to see such a tried and true recipe for success given out so freely, and i for one am greatful for it."
3,A general look at Sly and fitness.,"Sly's book has sections on just about everything regarding fitness. For a novice to fitness or the gym, his advice and experience will probably be helpful. For more advanced trainers it's a bit basic. It would have been nice to get some detailed workouts during his physical peak around Rocky IV or Rambo III but no such luck. His tips on living your dream etc. are about as helpful as the fitness tips. Broad and basic."
5,Great book,Very practical book from author Sylvester Stallone. Easy to read and a basic guide for those looking for more discipline in eating and working out. Good format routine and simple instructions. Recommended.
4,Sly Advertisement,"I enjoyed the book, but I was a little disappointed when I went to his web site today. He contradicts alot of what he said in the book, concerning his diet and workout. I was also disappointed when I learned that the protein pudding he mentioned over and over and over in the book was advertising a product from his fitness line. Also, I could have done without the women's exercise section."
5,Definitely not your usual fitness book!,"I enjoy this book very much. Mr. Stallone gives the reader a good look into his life that most people are unaware of, he's an interesting guy. He talks about what was going through his mind as he prepared physically for each of his Rocky & Rambo movies, and also a few of his other movies.The book was written before these last two Rocky & Rambo movies, so there's no behind the scenes stuff on those...I have a feeling that all the reminiscing done for this book may be what lit the fire to do these two latest movies.The final two thirds of the book walk you through his simple & informative fitness formula that anyone can use in their routine...from a fitness novice, to a ""set in their ways"" diehard fitness expert.It's easy to read, informative & often humorous, cuts through the BS & gets to the facts. I would recommend this book for anybody."
4,"A good ""jack of all trades"" book, especially for Stallone fans","It's part autobiography, part workout guide, part nutrition guide, mixed into one. But if you're new to weightlifting, I can't stress enough how helpful this book is; I photocopied most of the moves in it, and still use them nearly six years later. Weightlifting can be incredibly confusing, so it's great to get these moves from someone we all know has had a long career to weed through what works and what doesn't. The photos of him doing each move will motivate you even further, though there are some discrepancies (for example, one move he tells you to use a light 5-lb weight, though the photo has him using weights that are clearly bigger). As for the rest of the book, there are some things I don't agree with (he basically shuns cardio, saying he's never been crazy about running), but it's entertaining throughout, particularly the infamous unhealthy workout/diet regimens he adopted for Rocky III and Rambo III."
5,Pleasant suprise,More of a memoir. The book had decent category for fitness. Demonstration on proper exercise and use of gym equipment. Very positive and inspirational. I enjoyed it.
2,"If you want a workout book, this ain't it.","The workout routines look like they are copied from a Muscle magazine. The diet tips are common sense. However, if you like Sly, some of the stories are pretty interesting."
5,Adjustable bed risers,Good for getting a low bed up. Now we access the area under bed for storage. Husband teased me he needed an oxygen mask now as they did raise it about 4 inches on the setting I used. Now we are used to it and I think its great. Sturdy and stable.
1,ouch!,These stuck out farther than I anticipated and I've stubbed my toe more than once. I eventually repacked them in the original box (they're a BEAR to get back in the right configuration!)and have stuck them in the closet. waste of my money...
5,Big Oil Uber Alles,"War, Big Oil and those that stand to profit are putting themselves above all else. We are but pawns in worldwide game of profit and greed. This book makes a compelling case for escaping the grip of oil and moving on to an alternative - almost any alternative."
1,This sticker leaves a bad taste in my mouth.,"I know the bumper sticker writer was trying to be funny. And yes, even I, a vegan, understand the humor--the popularity of the ""tastes like chicken"" expression, the sudden ""plot twist"" yada yada. And I know the driver of the vehicle in front of me displaying this sticker probably doesn't really eat cats and is just joking.But when you get to know cats, you discover that they are kind, loving creatures with feelings. The idea of joking about eating them is just unfathomable. And if for some reason you don't like cats and are considering purchasing this sticker, please consider (1) This sticker is insensitive to cat lovers, (2) Cats feel pain, and (3) If you'd like to reduce the number of cats in the world, consider donating what you would have spent on this sticker to a spay and neuter clinic."
2,Noisy Slow-Serve,"Too noisy to be in the same room with while running...and it needs to run in order to extrude! Motor acts like a hairdryer that quits if it gets overheated, so don't try to make more than one batch in a short period. It will extrude a flow if the dish/cone is 1"" below the spout...but the extruder handle gets in the way, the flow is very, very slow, and ice cream will simply drop in clumps if container is lower than the 1"". Ice cream melts in the cone/dish before you get a full serving extruded.Overall, makes soft serve ice cream but getting it out is a trick and results are simply okay. I'd try another machine."
1,runny serve,"This ice cream maker stinks, it never mixes enough before the motor gets too hot and shuts down. I contacted the company and complained, so they sent me a new one. It does the same thing! And this after they said it was pulled from production and tested before being shipped to me. STINKS!!!"
1,Need replacement manual.,"I only used this once; it was okay, and would like to try it again, but hv since moved and misplaced the manual that came with it. I hv tried in vain to find the recipes for this machine; would someone please just send me the simplest most basic recipe. I hv given up on finding a replacement recipe book. Otherwise it takes up a lot of room for nothing....thanks, MVanya TX"
2,Not A Good Choice for Stripping Wire,"I purchased these from a recommendation in a YouTube video on an easier way to strip wire. The theory is the hooked blade would conform to the wire shape and make stripping the wire easier. I found this not to be the case. In a heads up test with a standard blade, the hooked blade took longer and required more effort. It also cut stright through the copper more often than the standard blade. If you're buying these hooked blades for other purposes besides wire stripping, they might be 5-stars (certinly they are of good quality and sharpness). But for my application, I found them wanting."
4,Great for Digital Photos,I have used over a dozen of the MCS 11 X 14 frames with a white mat with an opening cut for 8 1/2 X 11 for my self printed digital photos. Look very distinguished hanging on the wall of my office or the hallway at home. Would be five stars but the frame is not quite deep enough for a mat backing-the glass keeps popping out!!Good price and excellent look make these a bargain-particularly for an amateur photographer like me with lots of images to frame!
3,Wrong Thumbnail Picture,"Judging by the original picture thumbnail when I searched for the frame I thought I was getting one of the MCS frames where you press the glass into the narrow black frame. This is actually just the glass and backing with four metal clips to hold it together. I'm not a huge fan of it, as I like the aforementioned type of frames much better. It looks minimalistic and it's nice enough, but it doesn't flow with the rest of my frames and I'm afraid of the clips popping off or the glass breaking. It's not bad enough to return it but I wish they would change the thumbnail picture to show the true item."
3,I'd give Tom's of Maine Toothpaste with Fluoride ...,"I'd give Tom's of Maine Toothpaste with Fluoride an """"average"""" overall rating. The Cinnamint flavor was pleasant, but the toothpaste didn't leave my mouth feeling particularly clean. I'd try Tom's toothpaste again, but in a plain mint flavor. The Cinnamint might be a good option for those looking for something other than standard mint toothpaste."
4,Still Cliff Hanging,"When I first read this book at age ten, I loved it.The story was full of mean-girls-esque hilarity and well done artwork. The only criticism of the plot I've ever had of the book, is that it seems much more like high school than the middle school which it claims to be about.I couldn't wait for the sequel, which the book seemed to make clear (through MANY hints) was going to happen.But Volume 2 never came out.Now, 7 years have passed since the book was published, its doubtful the series- excuse me- book will ever continue.The bottom line? You should totally get Queen Bee. It's a great book for both kids and adults, and at this price, it's a steal. But be warned, don't get too attached to the characters, because you won't see them any time soon."
4,Florida's Diva Reigns,"Mon A Q proves that she is not just Florida's dance diva, but the whole country's. Spectacular voice, great beats and just all around great music. If you love dance music, you'll love this album."
5,This was a great product! It had a ...,"This was a great product! It had a really nice woodsy and outdoorsy smell. It's a man's scent, but I didn't mind using it. It worked as well as any other product of this type. Most days, it kept me dry all day. A huge advantage is that the products are all natural, and they don't use aluminum, which might be bad for women."
2,"A ""rash"" decision","Unfortunately, I must be in the .001% of the population who have hypersensitive skin. The normal aluminum chlorohydrate products give me no problem, but I can last about 2 days on this before I get a rash. C'est la vie..."
1,Not worth the money,"Very expensive for the information you get, only one technique given, which is pretty basic."
4,Coolio's Biggest Hit {4 Stars},"Gangsta's Paradise is Coolio's biggest hit and one of my favorites from him. Produced by Doug Rasheed and backed up by the criminally underrated L.V. (check out his album, it's great) on the vocals, Coolio came back hard after a lukewarm response to his debut album (It Takes A Thief). Though it was originally a song for the Dangerous Minds soundtrack, it can also be found on his second album of the same name (Gangsta's Paradise).This particular disc includes the album and instrumental versions of the song and is worth every penny that you pay for it."
3,Templates,This is a nice book except it uses templates. I rotary cut as much as I can. This book even has templates for squares and rectangles - why in this age of rotary cutting? There should be a cross-reference for the template name and the size of the square or rectangle. I measured them in the book and put the sizes next to the template name. What a hassel. I'm keeping this book but I will not buy another book like this.
1,bad instruction,I did not like this book at all as it involved using templates and not rotary cutting. Very tedious. I returned the book. I wish the authors of these books would be more clear in stating whether these pattterns use templates. I received credit for it in a timely manner.
4,Good Read,"It is always worth it to read Will James. A whole lot more believable than Zane Gray or Louis L'Amour. This cowboy actually rode the trails, got cold, and handled the livestock."
3,Lock strips not included.,"Although it does not state in the description the picture clearly shows the lock strip (the sixth piece that is thinner and shorter then the rest). I was disappointed when I opened the package to find it was not included and there were only five pieces.At first I thought, OK missed packing it. Since I had ordered two of these ""Kits"", I opened the second package to find the same.What good is it to weather strip all around the door except for where the lock and dead bolt are located? There going back...OK product that could have been better."
2,Weather stripped,"Unfortunately this product arrived minus the lock strips clearly shown in the photo used to describe the product. Another reviewer had reported this happened to them also. I didn't return the item because I had enough lock strip left over from a purchase years ago from a lumberyard. Other than that the weather striping arrived quickly, shipped in a heavy cardboard tube that protected it from kinks but the ends of all the pieces were mangled from sliding back and forth in the tube. Still useable, just trim off an inch. Could be a problem on a door larger than 2-8 x 6-8. I would look for another source of this weather stripping unless you can work around the issues mentioned."
1,poor product,Very disappointed. Product came damaged and missing the piece for the top of the door. All pieces were crumpled on both ends and bent in the center. Don't buy this.
2,Less than expected,"I truly hate the LOUD commercials and the constant use of the up-down volume control. This product sounded like the perfect solution to my problem. I suppose it does help some, but not enough to make it worth the price. I am disappointed with this product."
1,Save your money -- this thing sucks,"Bought 2 units, one for me, one for my parents. Both exhibit the same problem: Popping noises when it's doing its volume regulating... too bad, loud commercials are annoying."
3,The Audiovox VR-1 is a BIG disappointment,"The Audiovox VR-1 is a BIG disappointment!This device does the job. It holds the commercials down to a dull roar, and gets rid of those jarring loud movie transitions, however, it is plagued with popping and clicking artifacts.Update: The annoying clicking is a result of the input signal not being strong enough, this seems to be a design flaw. The clicking diminishes or even goes away, if the input signal is made large enough."
1,Clicks and pops,"I guess you get what you pay for, as they say...This is obviously an item with cheap circuitry that actually does what it advertises..BUT...(and it's a BIG BUT) introduces annoying clicks and pops into the audio. It drove me nuts..It's especially annoying during the quiet parts and not so noticeable in the louder ones...How could a reputable company test such a sub-standard product and decide to release it on the market? It's like selling you a car that will get you where you want to go, but backfires every five minutes..Give me my 25 bucks back...Oh, and WARNING: It's not emphasized enough in the advertising that it's NOT HDMI compatible.."
2,Volume Regulator,"Not sure about this product. It worked at first, but after about a month the same old thing began happening....Music and commercials are louder than the talking on the show. It might now be the fault of the product, but rather the Cable company or the transition between HD and regular TV. Anyway, I am not sure."
2,Not so great,This did not work as advertised. It really did not keep the volume constant and had loud annoying clicks during its attempts to lower the volume.
1,Does not work,Audiovox Terk VR1 Automatic TVBought hrough Amazon.com. I could not notice any effect whatever when the sound was deafening or at any level. Do not buy this thing.
5,getting rid of hum,"Your TV tuner/converter and separate stereo amplifier must have either RCA jacks, a headphone jack, or something that adapts to a pair of RCA connectors. The VR1 has RCA jack inputs and outputs.If your volume controller has hum, try better quality RCA cables, with gold plated connectors. If your tuner has volume, turn it UP!!! RCA is ""line level"" input. Other common inputs are instrument (-15 dBv lower) and microphone level (-30 dBv lower). If you can't get your sound to be undistorted, lower the input volume bit by bit. Assuming your amplifier is used for other devices, set its volume a tad lower in volume, so you're certain that it's not distorting in your amplifier.I'm an engineer and tend to make simple things sound complicated. It's really not. For help, contact me at [...]-Mike"
5,vendor remedy was great,Initially the device did not work. I contacted the vendor directly and they more than went out of their way to remedy the situation. They sent me more than one working device. GREAT vendor.
3,It's not so bad but not so good,"I'm using this device for leveling the audio musics from the media player. It actually works ok and levels the sound volume with songs that have higher volume and increases the volume when it's low to a level that is acceptable. Even if you change the volume level from the device, you can see that volume is staying the same level. Basically the volume is set to a pre-set level.The only thing that it would be better is the pop sound when there is a change in the source volume. If you have your system turns on loud you can hear the pop then it's level out. However, I can live with this as it can block the loud audio source."
2,Product doesn't perform to specifications,This product works on & off...often makes an annoying noise (like I need something else to be annoyed at)when it clicks on.
2,Not enough cords!,I was really excited to get this product. I ordered two. I was equally disappointed that in each box there were not enough cords (only one per box) to install the item. This is so poor!
1,Review,"I would not recommend this product to anyone else. I thought it worked when I first installed the unit. However, I was mistaken as some channels seem to have commercials as loud as ever. I finally disconnected the unit and feel like the unit was a waste of money."
2,Does Not Work,"Hi, At first it seemed to work but shortly after It seemed to stop working, commercials are as loud as ever. Hope they will give me a new one to try!"
4,it works,I've had this item for 1 month now and it still works. occasionally one channel seems to be a little louder but not as loud as it was before install.
2,Not compatible with cable TV,"Bought this device to use on my cable TV, but returned it because the RCA-type connectors are not compatible with my F-type (coaxial) cable TV configuration.In theory, this device hits the nail on the head, as I am tired of playing with the volume control on the remote just because some advertising mucky-muck thinks they can sell more toothpaste if the volume of their commercial is unmistakably LOUD.I would purchase a similar product if it would connect to my coax cable TV line."
1,Didn't work,This volume controller was a disappointment. I have tried every way possible to hook it up but nothing works. It is a great idea but I wouldn't waste the money.
1,"NOT the original ""Terk VR-1""","Around 2003 I purchased a ""Terk VR-1"" volume regulator. This unit used slick DSP technology and worked well.I recently purchased five ""Terk VR-1"" units from Amazon.com for myslef and friends and received units with the same make and model number in an Audiovox cardboard box. A friend told me these were not the same, so I opened the new unit to discover that no original Terk DSP circuitry was used in the Audiovox-but Terk labeled-unit, but rather inexpensive and poorly operating analog circuitry is used now. To me this is misleading to downright illegal to use not only the same Terk name, but the same model number for a product that operates in an entirely different, much simpler (and in my opinion worse) principle.While this may control volume, it is not nearly as good as the original DSP based ""Terk VR-1"" from years ago. The name and model number is misleading-kinda like asking for a hamburger and getting a hot-dog.DanNatick, MA"
1,piece of ****,"This is not a very good thing. It constantly humms and clicks and doesn't really control the volume very well. Also the people that sell it to you from Amazon, ANTonline, could care less if it works or not. Their customer service people tell you to get lost and contact the manufacturer.POS"
1,Didn't do a thing for my TV!,This product didn't make a difference in the volume control on my television!
2,worked great for a week,"Arrived in short order, hooked it up, it worked GREAT! sadly that lasted less than a week. I read the other reviews but went ahead anyway as often there are others sleeping in adjoining rooms so we needed to tone down the loud gunshots and commercials and turn up the dialoge. this would have been perfect. I will be returning it. I will be looking for another unit but not much else out there."
1,TV volume controller terrible product.,It worked for three weeks then burnt out. It's my second try at this product...don't waste your time or your money.
2,Lousy product,"It seems to do what it is made for. But I found the following issues:1) The device creates a laud hiss sound when the source sound is silent. So the quiet moments become horrible. I think there should be a threshold where the device stops amplifying the source sound.2) Once, I got to a song that has different levels of volume in a short period of time. The device kicked in and released like crazy and I had to turn it off."
2,Not worth purchasing,Second set of RCA plug not included. Unit does little to nothing in limiting the volume of commericals. No other similar products were offered.
4,Works Well for Some Systems,"Bought this device with the idea of adding it after my cable box to knock down commercial volume blasts.It does that, but, on ordinary content like a movie, with significant silent pauses, it has annoying ""breathing"" and popping sounds.So I tucked it into a drawer.Then I got a ROKU Soundbridge to listen to web-based radio.There I found substantial volume differences between various sources.Hauled the Terk VR1 out of the drawer and tried it... worked GREAT!I suspect that it's because I'm primarily listening to talk radio stations that already use a compander on their content, so the Terk VR1 holds volume pretty much constant without any attack/decay issues.Sorry if this is too technical... I'm an EE ;-)"
1,Did not work,"I purchased the Terk VR1 Automatic TV volume controller, Try to set it up as per instruction.Had no luck, return the product."
1,Not a usable item,I had read some reviews that it would cause some popping during the process of working and found the popping the lack of good quality sound a real pain. I had it hooked up on my TV to a Bose system and the quality of sound was very poor. Removed it and the good quality sound was back. It did however make the transition between some local channels and digital smoother in the audio but not worth the lack of good sound quality and the electronic noise caused by the unit. I therefor sent back for refund.
1,"Don't waste your money, doesn't work.","This item is a rip off, it doesn't work. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Hopefully the problem with uncontrolled sound levels will be solved when congress passes the CALM law (""Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act""). I had to give it one star in order to write this review, but it isn't worth it."
4,Terk VR1,"This product works as advertised and is suitable for general conditioning of various volume level.It is very simple to install.It will not give the performance as professional limiters/compressor/expander units. As such, some commercials still sound loud but not as before and really to correct this would require a lot more. For best results, raise the input volume as high as possible so that when changing channels no channel appears soft.Otherwise it is great value given that the professional equivalent costs about $175.00"
2,Ok if you can stand the audio pops,"Out of the box the unit did a good job leveling the audio in my entertainment setup. But, the audio pops (every 3-5 minutes) are getting mind numbing....If you can afford it, I recommend trying a more expensive audio leveler..."
2,"noisy, failed after 4 months, does help with commercials","I hooked this between my sat receiver and television. It did wonders with reducing commercial volume to normal levels, but had an annoying whine in the background noticable during quiet portions of the shows. Unit then died after 4 months of use, even though connected to surge protector. Don't plan to buy a replacement."
2,Great Idea but Poor Execution,"This product attempts to solve the longstanding problem of large changes in television audio program volume. Unfortunately when there is a sudden change in volume coming from the source, the output of this device first overcompensates and then slowly stabilizes. The result is nearly as annoying as the original problem. Great idea but poor execution."
5,Worked Like A Charm,"The product arrived very quickly, I opened the box, and 10 minutes later, was enjoying no more loud commercials! I liked it so well, I ordered one for a relative who also had complained about loud commercials. She is pleased with hers too. I recommend it for the value, and for anyone who is annoyed by loud commercials."
3,device with limited use,"this device is much needed to regulate the volume on my set. however after ordering one, i discovered it cannot be used with sets that are connected with an hdmi cable. this information should be included in the item description."
1,Terk VR-1 TV Volume Regulator,Does it's job well but will cease to work without the use of a good surge protector.
2,ouch,I am an audio engineer. I am here to tell you this product is not any good at all. It may work for someone with a tin ear and very poor quality sound equipment. If you can hear your wife talking to you from across the room then your ears are good enough to know that this is very poor equipment.Hook it up turn it on. first thing you will notice is a really quite loud hiss.Then when it is functioning it really distorts the sound to the point where you have to turn the volume up to overcome it.I think this might work OK for a person who wants to watch TV with someone sleeping next to them.. It can work for that.ButIf you had hoped (as I did) that you will be able to watch movies without the painfully loud volume levels which are required to be able to understand the speech and yet still keep some kind of sound quality.... You will be really dasappointed
1,Poor Quality - Terk = Audiovox (literally),"This product is made by Audiovox, a company which is notorious for their cheap/poor quality components and devices. Terk is a lie - the box says Audiovox.That being said, I gave it a chance. It is poor. You hear a loud pop when it switches on. You hear a loud pop when it adjusts to a new volume input (when the music or something gets louder). It pops just about every scene change, and sometimes multiple times within the same scene. It's just a piece of garbage.Also, when watching a recorded lecture, (poor quality recording), I could not make out some of the details/words when running through this thing. Had to unplug, and go straight into the tv to be able to understand the lecture (which had bad sound quality to begin with). Basically, it made bad into worse. It does regulate the volume, but it does it in a way that is unacceptable. Better but similar products MUST be available. DO NOT BUY."
1,Waste of money,It didn't control the volume on my TV. It's a pain to disconnect the coax and reconnect using RCA cables especially when it was a waste of time.
4,"New and improved, mostly","So far, it seems much better than an older VR1 that I bought around 2003.The volume level from this new one is very smooth during TV shows.However, a few loud commercials seem to get some volume increase past it."
2,Don't buy this POS.,"It's a good idea. It does work. The problem is it introduces hum and pops when it changes volume. I expected the volume adjustments to be unnoticeable, but it is as if someone in using the remote and changing the level every few seconds. It is too annoying to use, at least for me."
2,"Close, but not ready for prime time","The device does level out sounds, for the most part. However, after a few hours of use, I decided to return it, because:- when changing channels or resuming a program, the device has a short pop sound of the noise it's leveling, as it basically first assesses the noise input and levels it out. Pretty annoying when changing channels- as stated by other reviewers, when you pause a program or have no noise pumping through, you hear an audible hiss (electronic noise) generated by the device- as stated by other reviewers, when there noise of the program is low, you can hear the ""clipping"" of the noise by the device, causing you to lose some of the music, dialogue, etc.- it lacks an optical connection -- purely analog only on this puppy. Time for them to upgrade, given this is the year 2008!"
2,Works but flawed,"It does keep volume level but it also introduces problems. It creates a high pitch whine, most noticeable when there is no input (ex - when program is paused) and is noisy in general. I still use it, but wish that it was a little smarter."
5,flawless operation,"I waited to review this product because several reviews indicate that it worked well for a couple weeks and then quit. It's been a month and so far mine is still working great. It was easy to install, it took maybe 10 minutes or less and we noticed the difference right away. It even has a bypass switch on the front so you can leave it in place and turn it off (or just to have an idea of how well it's working you can turn it on and off during commercials). It's very compact so you can hide it from view. So far seems to be a great product."
1,Pile of Junk - just makes more noise,I was hoping that this device would work as I watch a lot of TV in my bedroom and don't like having to always adjust the volume to hear quiet scenes. This product just makes more noise when plugged in. Don't waste your time or money on this thing.
4,Does what it says,"Really impressed with this gadget. If you're an audiophile weenie though, you're not going to like the occasional pop that can be heard when things go from dead silence to high volume. It's a really faint sound, but notable. A lot less annoying than trying to keep the volume maintained however."
1,The TERK VR-1 Volume Regulator Nothing But Garbage,The TERK VR-1 Volume Regulator is an electronic device that automatically limits the amount of money you will loose buying this junk so only buy one one not like others who have bought multiple ones to get one to work and remember it only comes with one cable you will need to buy a second cable to get plug and play..... mine went out with the trash yesterday lets face it if this product was any good it would get major national attention as the gadget of the year...
2,TV Volume Contoller Volume Chopping,"The Audiovox VR1 Automatic TV Volume Controller was easy to install per the included directions. Automatic operation of the installed device was less than acceptable. The general result was a ""chopping"" of the TV audio with rapid shifts in volume. Fortunately, the VR1 has a front panel switch to deactivate the unit and thus solve the unacceptable volume problem. The same result could be achieved by neither buying nor installing the Audiovox VR1 Automatic TV Volume Controller."
1,Doesn't work if you have a satilite.,"After disconnecting my dish satalite subscription and switching to a new carrier with direct cable acces to all my features, my tech. commented that it was usuals if you have a dish satalite."
1,Nobody said you need a receiver to operate it!!!,Nobody said you need a reciever stereo to work it! I do not have my stereo system hooked up to my TV! I thought it had a speaker or it could be hooked up back to your TV.
1,Terk VR1 automatic TV volume controller,This item simply does not work. It does nothing to control sound volume. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!
4,Volume controller works,After a few weeks of using this I find it works very well with my Home entertainment system.. definitely a good deal for the money..
3,Unit provides some relief from volume variations,"We have had this unit for about a year after adding a plasma TV to our Home theater system.The unit appears provide some improvement in our TVs volume. (Movie audio is noticeably improved).The number of times I jump for the control has been reduced significantly.Some commercials are still a bit too loud, but by listening to TV at a slightly lower than desirable level, the ""intolerable"" volume of commercials has been greatly reduced.All in all, it is OK."
1,Adds hiss to your signal and pops when adjusting,The pop I can live with thought it would be nice to have a product that didn't pop when adjusting the volume. The hissing that it adds to the signal is unforgiveable. Hook this to an amplified speaker system and you wonder why you bought it.
1,Will not work with an HDMI hookup,I just returned the VR-1 after contacting the Manufacturer(Audiovox) who informed me that it cannot be hooked up with an HDMI TV setup. No where in the promotional information provided at Amazon could I find this fact stated. Would have saved time and expense to at least mention it.
5,It does control the Volume,"It controls the volume like it's supposed to. Without it, changing tv channel on the Comcast system requires manually adjusting volume with almost every change. Controls loud commercials, too."
1,Terk VR1 Automatic TV Volume Controller,Very simple device. The Terk DID NOT provide any noticeable or usable volume boost for low input signal - part of the reason I purchased it. Probably didn't get it into a situation where it had to cut the volume on a loud commercial so I have no result for that purpose.. I intend to put signal into it from an adjustable signal generator and measure what it does on an oscilloscope!I called the manufacturer and they couldn't give me any help on how to adjust the components internally to give the input more gain -- something that could easily be done. Perhaps need to make a unit where you can adjust the input gain and adjust the limit also. Would happily pay the price.
1,popping noises,this product does normalize the audio as advertise but it also introduces some significant artifacts. i can heard severe popping noises when i watch movies with high dynamic range audio. it's very annoying. i ended up not using this product.i know everyone is extremely irritated from uneven audio butt he only sound solution is buy an audio receiver with some audio normalization feature. it's expensive but there's no other option. good luck everyone.
1,Not explained,"I ordered the device thinking that it would use simple connections to my cable TV. It was useless. If one does not have a ""cable box"", one cannot connect to cable. I have a condo supplied cable,. It does not provide connections for this arrangement. I found it misleading, although it said ""cable box"". I live in a condo, (a huge percentage of homes in my area market). It does not address the problems in this market. Just another non-magic/non-effective bullet. Watch your feet. Tom Kelley"
1,Unsatisfactory performance,The unit did not perform as advertised. Commercial volumns on TV still remaind higher than regular programming.
2,Not worth the money,"Terk VR1 Automatic TV Volume ControllerThe item is easily installed and works fairly well at keeping volume at the same level. However, when the volume increases, you get a loud ""POP"" to let you know in advance that the volume is bee altered. Hard to concentrate on the program. Very annoying."
1,Disappointed,No problem hooking it up. Results disappointing. Don't see much of a difference in volume regulating at all. Still have loud commercials.Wish I hadn't bought it.
1,Does not work,"I have given this thing several months to prove itself and it simply does not work.I still have to quickly turn down the LOUD COMMERCIALS.The device has very little, if no, effect on the normalization of the audio."
5,Bill's remarks,"This device absolutely solved the annoying ""Commercial Volume"" problem. We forgot about the annoyance in the first few minutes of use and will never go back to ""barefoot"" TV volume."
1,same sound,"This is the second device of this sort I've tried. The first lowered the sound but also distorted and muffled the quality. This unit is HDMI ready but only through the RCA jacks which lowers the resolution on your TV set. To top it off, I did NOT hear any difference in volume when Direct TV blasted it's commericals like they always do. Don't bother and save your money. Do as I do and hit the mute button on your remote control if the Noise bothers you that much. Maybe some day the FCC will issue a noise mandate but don't hold your breath. Money talks and Big Business makes the rules."
4,Exactly as Advertised,"The Terk Volume controller works exactly as advertised. I know some people have problems with it not being hdmi compatible but it works great using rca jacks. I have it mounted between my television and a Boston sound bar and still get great sound but I don't have to adjust the volume on every commercial or action scene. You do lose a bit of that theater sound, but if you can just flip a switch to bypass the Terk if you want that for a particular movie."
5,Great Gizmo,"I'm not technically inclined and my son installed it for me, so all I can say is that it works! Whisper quiet dialog followed by ear-splitting music and commercials are a thing of the past for me. Why this works for some people and not others is beyond me, but for the price, it's worth giving it a try."
2,Helps with loud commercials but it's not 100%,"Following suggestions made by other purchasers, I used the earphone jack rather than the audio output on the TV. Loud commercials are reduced, but some still tend to sound louder than the regular programming."
3,nice but,this system is nice but with digital tv it needs more choices of cable or digital or hdmi tv connections.
1,Doesn't work with stand-alone tv system,"Probably works great when you have cable or satellite. We don't, just an indoor antenna. No manual or other paperwork was included. After a lot of research, I finally found the ""answer"" I needed in a review. Definitely will not work with just a standalone tv."
2,poor quality device,"The experience with Amazon was fine. I found that the product was far less than I expected. When I followed the instructions the decide started working fine and then after a minute or so it started creating a substantial amount of white noise that I could not get rid of. In addition, I would get occasional pops and clicks out of it. I sent it back. Since then I have found out that only connection that I could make to my TV (single prong earphone jack) is commonly a bad connection and could have created those conditions all on its own."
3,Audiovox Terk VR1,"This was supposed to reduce the sound of commercials which are programmed by our satellite dish company to loud levels, especially at night. It works partially, not completely. There are still rises in volume usually preceded by a popping noise, it does modulate volume but does not eliminate completely the bumps in volume."
3,May not be for everyone,"I'm giving this three stars, but conditionally. The unit, like with another user, had audio pops when volume would change. I advised the seller that it may be defective. They promptly refunded my money after receiving my return, without offering an exchange, which told me that they have experienced this before with other customers. It might have been defective, but I opted for the other competing unit that sells for a little more, and that one works fine."
1,Doesn't seem to work,It didn't to seem to make any difference in the sound level when switching between channels or when going between commercials
3,"Not bad, if you know what to expect","This product has worked well, as far as leveling out the volume between commercials and programming. Unfortunately, you can often hear the product working in the form of a loud pop. This happens when I am watching something with a large dynamic range (a lot of difference between loud and soft sounds). When watching movies, listening to music, or anything else where the dynamic range comes into play, it is best to have it bypassed. When watching network or cable TV, when you can expect commercials and heavily compressed sounds, this device seems to work well.Read all the reviews, know when to use it, and this product works. Expect it to be a miracle device and you will find this device to be a waste of money."
4,Well worth it!Simple to install if,Simple to install if you have some knowledge of the audio/video hookups of you system. It does the job of quieting extra loud commericals.
4,Replacement lade,"Since I bought the knife, I figured I better get a replacement. They are easy to replace with a screwdriver. If I have one gripe about the blades it's that they don't seem to keep an edge as long as I think they should. Of course, that may have something to do with the way I use the knife, so it's really not a complaint. More of an observation. At any rate, it's always good to have a replacement handy."
2,Functional but ugly,"Nothing wrong with the product or seller. They appear they will prevent prevent damage to your pontoon boats corners if you hit a dock. They are so ugly and ungainly, I cannot bring my self to attach them to my new boat. Plan on returning them to Overtons."
1,HORRID SOUND,"This live recording sounds like it was made on a dictaphone! Truly terrible remastering, and if you put your ""extras"" on, the sound blacks out, where they tried to hide the flaws. However this recording is full of flaws, overloads, and horrid sound. Don't be a fool like me; do not buy it."
2,Women you don't want to see in panties!,"First of all, the hottest woman in the book is on the cover (and there is only 3 photos pf her). After that it is all downhill. If you are looking for a book of beautiful women in their panties, this is not it. If you are looking for average(mostly) women in their panties, then you have found it. I would ever go as far as to say there are a few ugly women in this book. That being said, the photography is about average. This is not some interesting work that is unque or special. It is kind of boring actually. I probably should have returned it, but i didn't, and it hasn't grown on me at all. So don't waste your money. You can find better. As a matter of fact, i would barely call this erotic."
2,UGHHH!!!!!!,This book will likely fall into two categories for buyers.You'll either love it or hate with no in between.Some of the girls look like they've just turned up for the shoot as is and gone straight into it no prep at all.If the dirty soles of womens feet please some people so be it.Some of the shots were a real turn off.The title was panties it should of been fuglies.Dave Naz has done better work with his legs publication.For this one a price more in the range of $15 to $20 would of been more reasonable.
1,Money Trap,"I purchased this book in hopes of something great, but my hopes were crushed upon receiving this book. It is of very poor quality and the panties used are almost all of material your grandmother would use. The women used in the photos are also of very [...] poor judgement.(...)I would not recomend this book to anybody looking for any decent panty material or beautiful women because you will find neither."
1,Softcore Porn,"This book has little artistic value, more like selections from hustler's barely Legal Magazine. The models have no make up, which is ok, but it seems as though the photographer was trying too hard to make the models look ""next-door""sy. Many of the models are obviously strippers or amateur porn actresses, and there is truly only 1 photograph with any artistic value. The rest seem like an amateur photographer's way of photographing a nude. There is not much variety in the poses, either. You can see the same poses in every model's series - don't waste your money!"
1,:Lovely but didn't last,"Very disappointed. The tree arrived in great condition, I thought it was lovely, bright leaves, lovely shape, very nice. Read the instructions, followed them but within a week the leaves turned brown and it started to die. I let my friend who happens to be an arborist look at it and he couldn't figure out what could have happened to make it dry up and start to die, especially that fast. Anyway, I have not given up and actually a few leaves have started to come back. Still hope it will, it really was a lovely tree. If I could recommend on looks alone, it would have gotten 5 stars. Someone else may have better luck."
4,Jewish women on Mothers and Daughters - a wonderful book!,"I'm surprised I'm the first to review this one as I found it an absolute delight, containing the the viewpoints of 56 Jewish mothers and daughters on such diverse subjects as birth, anger, love, belonging, surviving, talking back, leaving home, when a mother dies, etc. Some of the writers were old favorites of mine (Maxine Kumin, Grace Paley) and others were new discoveries ( Robin Becker, Enid Shomer). A very rich collection of works, from poetry to short stories to memoirs."
5,Patrice Rushen,This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my Fateher. Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. Would consider buying from seller again.
4,Great!,"I have been after the album Prelusion for years and managed to buy the re-issue along with Before the Dawn last year. The standout track has to be H'Awright Now (imagine Herbie Hancock Rhodes solo's 1973-1977), although this isn't really indicative of the rest of the album, which is more in the style of Herbie (again) Speak like a Child era... modal jazz.I don't really care much for the tracks on Before the Dawn as they sound very dated, but Celebration is a great Chick Corea'esque latin track with great flute solos from Hubert Laws."
3,This is not Patrice at her best,"Perhaps she sounds best when she is composing in the pop music idiom (verses, choruses and hooks).After listening to this album, I now understand why there are such things as jazz standards (=useful for separating a performer's compositional ability from their skills at constructing solos/ etc).The songs here were good jazz songs with complex solos and chord progressions-- and that is to be expected from jazz, but there were no chances for me to listen to a well known melody and find ways in which Rushen could make said melody interesting.This is definitely not worth more than secondhand or mp3 purchase price."
4,Like them,"Quite pleased with them. They're real heavy metal, not cheap. The look is good and the light sorta bears its color."
3,22 Jacks double the fun,Excellent value - the 22 Jacks history on one cd. These guys kicked booty on the Oz Warped tour last year!
4,Great Knife/BoxCutter,"Very functional knife/box cutter! Works great since it is as sharp as a razor; plus a damaged blade can easily be replaced. I owned one years ago and misplaced it but had some spare blades in tool box. I went to Amazon and typed in the number on the blade and the knife came up... great price for a good knife to have (thin, light and strong)."
2,weak,I had a dry erase board which was 3ft by 2 1/2 feet and weighed about 2 lbs. The two support hooks would not stay up with anything that weighed over a pound. This product can hold a sturdy cardboard display but that's about it. I drilled a hole through the plastic support hooks and the two front legs and used a screw to secure the support hooks to the legs so that I can use my dry erase board. The description needs to include how much weight the support hooks can withstand.
1,Disappointed,Dont bother taking this product it will be a waste of your time and effort. took it for 6months and nothing. hope i helped you some.
4,"1 MONTH, SEE RESULTS","GOOD. USE THIS PRODUCT FOR 1 MONTH ALREADY, MIMI BECOME A LITTLE BIGGER, WANNA CONTINUE..."
1,fake product,"This item is not the real product, after careful inspection of the packages not only did I receive two differently labeled bottles of pills since I ordered two sets but the label was crooked on the bottle and did not read the same as the label of breast actives - on both the cream and the pills. I'll admit the descrepancies are small but here's a list of them1. Cream says topical cream not enhancement cream as the actual product does2. Pill bottles were completely different in name - both came from amazon and were ordered the same day3. The ingredients in the pills are missing several which are listed on the breast actives website4. the different pill bottle gives the companies former name with the same female shape logo, but this was not their logo when the company was called breast gain plusPs : to the people selling it, I hope you know its illegal to sell an item under another company's trademarked name and logo"
1,"If weight gain is what you want, by all means!","All this product did was make me extremely hungry. I've adapted a healthy lifestyle, eating wise and physical activity wise, maintaing my weight for a year now. In the process, however, my breast size went down. I did some research and this product seemed to be the best breast enlargement product out there....NOT so much! It made me feel ravenous! I stopped taking it after i realized how hungry it was making me feel. I wouldn't reccomend this product."
1,Fake,"Hasn't been working and the bottle labels look like someone remade them. They look SOMEWHAT similar to the real thing but if you look at the fine print, they're different."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this dvd on the recommendation of the reviews and was extremely disappointed. I thought it would be beautiful scenery--it was alot of close ups of green leaves, sticks, flowers. I am sick of looking at green leaves. I didn't find it at all relaxing. Some of the scenes actually repeated. The music was something out of the 60's--reminded me of the sitar music and it had some annoying metalic tinkling going on. I turned the sound off and tried to get into the pictures, but green leaves didn't make it for me. Plus I am having trouble with the dvd sticking and I actually don't care if I see the whole thing or not--you can only take so much of green leaves and sticks. Don't waste your money."
2,Easy Meditation ??,"I bought this product because it was described as a nature meditation. when I played it was a compilation of different natural sites with music in the background, but nothing out of the extraordinary. I was expecting something more spectacular for the price I payed. So, I guess that is how we find out if something is worth the price and this one comes short of it's description."
1,Warped rotors after a few months,"I bought this about a year and a half ago in addition to the EBC Brake rotor that matched my rear. So that was 4 EBC Rotors. I chose them because they had decent reviews other places and chose to just bite the bullet. within a few months the rotors were warped because I paired them with some ceramic pads. When I went to get an alignment for my car and opted for a free brake inspection, the guys told me that there was a hairline crack in the rotor which accounted for the vibration during braking. I emailed EBC and they just assumed I didn't install them correctly and had to do a ""brake lathe"". I'm switching back to Brembos and OEM ceramic pads very soon. These were a big waste of money."
4,So Far So Good (after 1 yr of having them),"I changed all 4 on my 2002 Acura RSX & its working pretty good. I do notice a woo-ing sound. Could be b/c the way the air goes thru the holes, but I'm not sure if that sound was there from before."
4,Great little speaker,"These are installed inside the back doors of my Chevy pickup truck. The sound is clear and they match well with the Infinity component speakers in the front doors. Very clear sound with good base, no problem dealing with high volume listening."
5,"Good frame, like the borderless","Shipped fast and looks great, I love it being borderless.But really, who is the model in this picture? She is gorgeous. I think I am in love."
4,clip frame,I like it and have hung a photgraph in it on the wall. it was easy to assemble but a little short of clips
5,My wife originally recommended this product to me. ...,My wife originally recommended this product to me. Along with flossing Reach Act mouthwash makes quite a noticeable difference. I enjoyed the taste as well as the convenient design of the container; it dispenses just what you need with no waste. For good oral hygiene I'll certainly recommend this product to others.
1,Even with free VOD credit. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,"This was absolutely horrible! The storyline was just stupid and accompanied by a very annoying narrator. If you want it for the nudity, there were only a few times with any topless women, and even then they weren't very attractive. Honestly, there was one woman who I thought was a man until she took her top off. Don't watch this, I beg you!"
2,How much effort does it take to find ecstasy?,"Fair, at best.This runs under 80 minutes, a good 10 from a scene with a nurse dancing on a table, while the narrator blah-blah-blahs about how twisted and sado-masochistic these broads are. Are they really maniacs, and do they find ecstasy?Half the time, I was saying to myself ""when are these sado-masochistic broads going to show some gory, unadulterated action?"" The movie has its moments, but the narrator spells way to much out, a little too much telling and not enough showing (bordering at insulting).No, this isn't as good as ""Rabid Grannies,"" but okay for a cheap thrill. It's not as gory as one would hope, but not bone-dry for that matter.No, these nurses did not find ecstasy because even the annyoing narrator admits that they are bored. I admit, I was bored too."
5,possibly the greatest movie ever made,"Fantastic! this movie has to be seen to be believed, hopefully with a room full of buddies drinking heavily. i was laughing so hard i had tears in my eyes. we've made it into a drinking game...you drink whenever they mention sadism, flash an elvis tattoo, make a list on screen, show the front of the mansion, walk around for ten minutes, or show random stock footage. honestly, i've never seen so much walking in one movie, those beautiful babes could have hiked everest after filming this. i can't say enough good things about this movie, buy it right now!"
2,"Scratched 81/2 X 11"" frame","The plastic frame isn't very expensive, but I really don't like paying for something that has a scratch already on it. I didn't notice until I took out the cardboard backing and thought it was part of the plastic. Unfortunately, it was a 2"" scratch that is very noticeable when you have a white background. Since I bought this for the classroom (no glass) it will do, but again, I don't like paying for scratches."
2,not standard of quality I am used to in this product,"I have purchsed this type of frame at a local art supply shop that is no longer carrying this item. The surface for mounting the picture on was divided down the middle with an open seam in the cardboard frame-filler. Normally this surface would have been a solid smooth sheet of cardboard. Divided, means it undercuts the quality of the surface of the photo/poster or in this case, our grandchild's art work. I kept it because I promised him it would be framed and on my wall today. I would NEVER purchase this again."
1,"Clear Box, Should've Been Called Cheap Box.","As soon as I opened the package I was disappointed. I was imagining done thing a little less cheap looking. The back of the frame is NOT plastic as it seems, it is cardboard & cheap cardboard at that. It didn't stand up well, it was flimsy, & looked awful."
4,Clear box frame,A clear box frame is nothing special. This one was high quality. Fast service from the vendor. Always a plus.
4,"Nice, inexpensive frame that never goes out of style!","I keep a collage of my son's school pictures on my wall, starting with a preschool picture, all the way up to present, which is 10th grade. They look cool on the wall. You really notice the photograph and not the frame. I like these very much."
1,Really? Shipping charges crazy..,"I needed to order 24 frames for a special project. The 24 frames were about $90 as expected.However, the shipping was $495! That's not a typo! Almost five hundred dollars for shipping! For that amount of money, I can buy an airline ticket and pick them up in person. The first reviewer was right. I realize these frames can be delicate so require extra care, but $7 shipping per $4 frame. No thanks..."
2,Fine -but beware shipping charges,"The items purchased were fine, and delivered promptly. Just what I was looking for. But the shipping charges were more than the items!! A real stunner, so make sure you look closely before ordering."
5,My favorite frame for photo collections!,"These frames are actually part of my grief process. My oldest son died in an ugly manner, and we've been redoing our Christmas traditions every year since then. I am using this frame as a way to display our favorite memories from each Christmas trip to re create our view of Christmas from a place that has to be endured to an occasion for the remaining ones of us to have fun and share love. The fact that the entire frame can be filled edge to edge gives me the ability to move photos, emphasizing different aspects as I re create the collage each year."
2,"A good, short study of christian beliefs.","This book is good for beginners. It does provide some adequate criticisms of christianity, but, at times, is too emotional. As a scientist, I am logical and must be emotionless, and prefer books that are the same. Mrs. Hayes does know what she is talking about, and writes with just a touch of sarcasm. Perhaps the last chapter should have been the first chapter. This is not a scholarly book for serious study, but for light reading."
1,Old cliches in old wrappings.,"Joseph Heller and Thomas Paine, to name but two, got there years before this puerile parrot. A weak, pathetic, sad, humourless, unoriginal effort."
1,Complete Waste Of Time...,"""Free thinker?"" Try non-thinker. I must laugh whenever I read someone state as an absolute truth that there is no absolute truth. The contradiction is self evident, but they're not in the Bible. I've read much better efforts than this piece. Usually on the back of the door on a bathroom stall..."
4,the last word,"I am new to apollo and I decided this book should be my way into it. It is a carefully crafted and sensitive piece of writing but its strength is not in the unearthly technicalities but in explaining the earthly politics - this was the biggiest and best pr stunt since the pyramids and is unlikely to be surpassed for hundreds of years. I personally enjoyed the description of the nasa contract management regime and the role of the driving force in the shape of a person, Joe Shea, in this case. This book has to be in the top ten along with the Bible, complete works of shakespeare etc, but if you want a shorter 'rocket-powered-read' and like to read about crazy technical stuff - Ben Rich's Skunkworks is in a class of its own. In fact some of the craziest Lockheed stuff must have been going on at the same time as apollo."
5,Apollo,"Brilliant book and a lesson to us all in what can be achieved from nothing. Although I am from UK I have nothing but admiration for all who worked on Mercury, Gemini and Apollo"
4,Fascinating account of the Apollo program behind the scened,"Many of us who grew up during the space race and the Apollo program particularly remember the incredible media attention focused on the astronauts and their families. It is amazing to me that the equally dramatic stories behind the scenes were largely untold in the popular press. If you are a nostalgia buff, space geek, or want to know more about 20th century history, then you will be riveted by this account. The book is packed with stories and information about how groups of really smart people got together and did this unbelievable thing."
4,A marvellous technical achievement,"I'm a big fan of the space program, particularly the crunch that cam in the 60's. To go from where they were in 1961 to landing on the moon 8 years later ... amazing! This book is a great account of the administrative and engineering side of the Apollo story. For some it will be a dry read, but I loved it!"
4,Excellent,"I was looking for a technical insight into the incredible engineering marvels required to send a man to the moon and this book delivered. The analogy of standing an aircraft carrier on end and blasting it into space really puts into perspective just what an accomplishment this was. I'm thankful for a book like this that can bring the wonder of the Apollo program to a generation like mine that didn't have a chance to live it.The only time I found myself skimming pages rather quickly was during political commentary. I mean, I understand that it was also an incredible feat to get American voters to support this type of expenditure in the 50's and 60's. But the book lost me a bit when talking about the politics. Then again, that may be telling of how we take for granted these types of huge government expenditures today."
5,Superb view of a little covered aspect of the program,"I too and glad that this book is finally back in print. This is not an overview of Project Apollo with astronaut stories and illustrations, for that you should look for the beautiful 3 volume illlustrated edition of Andrew Chaikin's A Man on the Moon. This book focuses almost exclusively on the vital contribution of the engineers and flight controllers and takes us into a world which usually is given short shrift. The missions are portrayed from within mission control itself and presents a superb sense of how the people involved thought and dealt with the problems. Top notch writing, that is accessible, but doesn't dumb things down."
5,Simply the best book about Project Apollo,"I've read many books about the Apollo program.... This is by far and away the best!. It captures the thrilling pace of the whole space program in the 1960s, from the initial efforts of the US to compete with the Soviet Union, the tragedy of the launch pad fire of ""Apollo 1"", the daring decision to make Apollo 8 a trans-lunar flight, the seat of the pants landing of Apollo 11 and the near disaster and ""diving catch"" to rescue Apollo 13! This is a true classic of non-fiction and I can recommend it to one and all!"
3,my review,"This books deals with a tragic event that ends up changing the life of everyone that is involved.The story captivates you from the beginning and the characters are so well defined you indentify immediately with them. This is a very emotional story and very easy to shed some tears while you read.The only unpleasant comment I have about this book is that I could predict with some certainty the unfolding of the plot.However, it makes for a great summer reading!"
5,a great summer book!,"I had not read any of Eileen Goudge's work before, and this book blew me away! If you read a book to analyze all of the characters, motivation, etc. then yes, you will find some holes. But if you're like me and you read a book simply for the enjoyment and escape, this is one good book! I like the way Goudge examines each of the women separately, then brings them all together to resolve all of those suppressed emotions. Great read...share it with friends. I did!"
2,Utterly predictable,"Near the end of the novel, Beryl says, ""When Tyler was diagnosed, it didn't take a genius to put 2 and 2 together."" The same might be said of readers of this book, who can easily figure out the (over-used, trivialized) secrets of the plot. I don't like authors who assume their readers are too dumb to catch on. Once I figured out the secret (only a short way into the novel), I skimmed the rest only to confirm my guess. Everything I had predicted would happen did. Don't waste your time."
1,422 pages of trite,"After reading the reviews on this book, I felt that it would be something I would enjoy. Wrong! Plot is very predictable and characters very shallow. What adult has unprotected sex with someone they just met! If you are a Danielle Steele fan you may think this is great - the rest of, you stay clear."
2,Couldn't hold my interest,"I read the first quarter of the book, but then lost interest and skimmed the rest. Something was lacking with the characters. The mother pleading innocent from the beginning left little mystery, figured the husband was cheating on her. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this. I don't even know what happened to the mother and really don't care."
3,"Interesting, but also predictable","The main story is interesting and with some unexpected twists, but the three sisters stories were way predictable and full of cliches."
1,Too Much Talking...,"...and not enough action. MYSTIQUE is always pretty soft, but only about ten minutes of this vid is actually footage of the beautiful Erica and the runner-up gal doing the posing for the camera thing. The rest is wasted on YAKKING and multiple replays of the award ceremony. SNORE."
5,Love it,I wanted/needed this since I was printing out photos from my college. It's perfect for my minimal use to store and to show off my favorite printed photos.
2,Doesn't Work,I don't sweat much and Tom's deodorant doesn't work much better than not wearing deodorant all. It also goes on super-slimey.
2,Contains no Calendula,"Smell is a bit strong, and Calendula is not listed among its ingredients. The unscented Tom's is a good product."
1,Not what I ordered,"As clearly shown in the picture of the product we thought we were ordering the Toms of Maine Original care natural deoderant stick, calendula. However, what came to us was the Tom's of Maine Long Lasting deoderant stick, calendula, which my husband is seriously allergic to (and we knew that prior to ordering which is why I specifically ordered the original care). The description was not clear either as to what I was ordering. UGGG! so frusturating as I had already spent two weeks searching for the proper product all around town to no avail so turned to Amazon and still don't have what we need!"
3,Very pleasant smell,"I'm very sensitive to under arm products and this did not cause a rash. However, it's not long lasting, if you are physically active. Additionally, it left stains on my undershirts. I've stopped using it."
2,Did not work for me,This did not work well for me at all. I do have to say that a lot of deodorants don't work well for me. It smelled great until I put it on. It smelled like a man's deodorant on me. Luckily I did find another natural brand that works.
5,Gettin Jiggy Wit It,"This is a great video collection of Will Smith's music videos. Although it is not a complete collection of his videos, it is definitely worth the buy. However, I was dissapointed to find that the videos 'Summertime'and 'Boom! Shake the Romm' were not included. Still worth the buy though!"
4,WILL.......DOING IT!!,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD FOR MY KIDS, AS THEY RECENTLY BECAME BIG, WILL SMITH FAN. THEY LOVED HIM ON FRESH PRINCE TV SERIES. I ENJOY BIG WILL MYSELF AND ENJOYED THE DVD MYSELF. HOWEVER,THE 4 STAR IS BECAUSE, I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE VIDEO FOR ""SUMMERTIME"" WASN'T INCLUDED. BUT IT A GREAT COMPILATION OF WILL'S WORK. YOU WILL NOT REGRET THE PURCHASE."
2,A Pain to use!!,"I ordered this kit for my daughter who is interested in architecture. It comes with several sheets of printed paper and you have to cut everything out yourself (windows, furniture, sinks, tubs, etc. etc)! This will take several hours to do (I've done it along with my daughter) and we are not done yet. The instructions are poor and you have to use glue to put it together. It is very open ended which is OK if that is what you are looking for, but hardly a toy for a beginner!!!"
4,"Depends on what you are expecting, I liked it","Keep in mind, this is sheets of paper, not a whole lot more. You do have to cut them out yourself, and glue them together. That being said, the product never claimed to be much more than that. The paper is a good stock to make building easy, and there are a lot of different types of styles. I didn't use it to style the inside of a house, like walls and rooms. This would have been too difficult, in my opinion. It was fun and worked for the project I needed it for. Keep in mind there is a learning curve. Any house built with this will take some time and some patience."
4,COOL CLOCK !,"I GOT THIS CLOCK AFTER SEEING A SQUARED CLOCK ON THE COVER OF ONE OF SPANISH GROUPS MECANO CD. IT HAS A SQUARED CLOCK ON THE COVER ,PRETTY INSPIRATIONAL.! KINDA SOOTHING A SUARED CLOCK AS OPPOSED TO A ROUND ONE ,I GUESS IT DOESN'T REMIND YOU OF THE TIME ALL THAT MUCH! THE ONLY THING IS THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE WHITE BOARDER ALL AROUND IT AS IT DOES IN THE PICTURE, BUT OVERALL A GREAT CLOCK !"
5,Great book!,This is a terrific story about a remarkable girl full of faith. There is a lot of spiritual wisdom to be gained from Anne's true faith and relationship with God.
2,lawn care,The material was satisfactory but I din't pay enough attention to the size (weight) which was much smaller than I had expected. My error.
1,Black Granite stone creations spray,"I was very dissapointedin color listing. Prior purchase of black granite stone creations spray was a black foundation. This product was a dark gray foundation.I had to return, as I was unable to use with current color of black foundation, as before."
5,Great machine,"I purchased this from Best Buy over a year ago. It has been a great, dependable machine. The only complaint that I would have is there needs to be documentation on how to replace the memory that is not in the expansion slot."
5,Indian Art at It's Best,"There is no better means to find, to preview Indian Art than via this Indian Art magazine. Every month fresh, great art delivered to your door. It doesn't get any better than this, unless ... unless, they have come up with a means of injecting Indian Art straight into my dreams. The art work is fresh, it's bright, it's friendly and it's all mine. ... ALL MINE!! ... Until the next month when the next great collection of Indian Art work shows up at my door."
5,Fantástico,"Este libro es fenomenal... tiene fotografías hermosas y temas interesantes. Es sólo para expertos en decoración de pasteles, fresco lindo y moderno."
2,Big Dissapointment,I couldnt wait to get this book because I love Colettes work. What a disappointment. Only has a few cakes as examples and the directions for recreation are sorely lacking. Bummer!
2,COLETTE'S BIRTHDAY CAKES,"I have all of Colette's books, I have even talk with her over the years, and must say that this book was not one of my favorites, infact I sent it back. This book is not for the Beginner or Novice cake decorator. I have been at this(fondant cakes) for about 11 and am not impressed with the cakes in this book. I would recommend any of her other books especially her first book ""Colettes Cakes""."
3,Okay,"I found this book to be better than The art of Cake Decorating by Colette. This book is slightly more modern than the other. But still not exactly what i was after. There are some odd designs such as a large cake of a crab & mosaic jug (zodiac), a beehive, fragile boxes, a weird looking balloon. And again the instructions are drawn rather than photographed."
4,Absolutely gorgeous,"These cakes are beautiful,but will never be decorated by me.I do not have 40 hours to devote to the decoration of one cake.I am also put off by cakes covered entirely in sugarpaste,I want icing,on cakes that I can eat."
2,Not up to Par,"I am a fan of Colette Peters but I was very disappointed in this book. The instructions are clear, but the cakes are very mundane. When I open a Colette Peters book I expect to have ""my socks knocked off"" with beauty and inspiration. I want to fantasize and dream. I want to make one of her cakes just because she inspired me. She has the talent but this book doesn't do her justice."
2,not fabulous,"I wasn't expecting a show book, I was expecting more of a birthday cake book, that you can actually do something with. Oh sure you can do these cakes in here... but would you want to?"
4,"Fondant, sugar paste and more sugar paste","The other reviews are correct; this book is not for the beginner. Nor is it for people who prefer to do piping decorating as every cake featured uses fondant and sugar paste. Although you could possibly take some ideas from it and it is fun looking at all these amazing cakes, some of them are so far out there (like a chess set or leather doctor's bag) you better be a really skilled home baker with a lot of time or a pro. I will say that the book is so nicely done (hardback, color, design and layout) that it almost feels like a nice coffee table book."
2,STEER CLEAR unless you are a jazz musician.,"I am a voracious reader of jazz biographies. The fact that the name of this book includes the phrase ""The Life of Dizzy Gillespie"" is a shame, or sham. There is so little of his life in this book and so much discecting of every note of every solo that he ever played. It's maddening! If you're looking for a great jazz biography that is full of color, try the Louis Armstrong ""An Extravagent Life"" book. I read this approx. 600 page book twice just because it is such a colorful story about a jazz musicians LIFE. I will finish off by saying that this book is only the second one in my life that I had to stop reading because it was so BAD. That was after 250 pages."
4,Just waht I was looking for!,I had been searching for a transcription of Handel's majestic Royal Fireworks Overture for the pipe organ for quite some time. Finding this book was a godsend. Thanks Amazon!
1,GET IT AT WALMART !!! Buy two 420-ct boxes for a total of $18.,You can get this for $9 per box a Walmart. This is one instance where Amazon is overcharging.
3,Nice wipes but way to spongy and soft to clean a messy diaper,These are indeed very soft wipes. I find they're a bit to weak and spongy to clean up a poopy diaper. I prefer the Huggies wipes although I use the Pampers diapers.
5,Great wipe,These wipes are so soft and don't have a strong scent. I use them on my infant and my two year old so the pack of 12 is a great value!
2,What happened to these great wipes?,"Our newborn's skin turned bright red whenever we used baby wipes on him, until we found Pampers Sensitive Wipes. We used them for 7 months and were thrilled with their softness, their moistness, and their lack of irritation. BUT....last month Pampers seemed to have changed their product. We now find them thicker, rougher, and they irritate our baby's bottom like all the other wipes. Did Pampers change the chemical formula? Did they change the wipes themselves? What a shame. These 5-star wipes have become 2-star ones in my opinion. I hope they will return to the old formula which was a super product."
2,Too flimsy....,I tried these wipes today after using the Huggies Sensitive wipes for about 2 months. I was really disappointed in the quality of the Pampers wipes. They were so thin and not very soft. I ended up using 4 on a dirty diaper of a 2 1/2 month old baby. I don't recommend using these.
1,Beware reformulated product,"Pampers has recently changed this product - from ""Pampers Sensitive"" in the green tubs (or plastic wrap) to ""Pampers Sensitive Wipes."" The new product contains some of the same additives in regular wipes that can cause skin irritation. For us, what caused a problem was the change to include citric acid. As far as I can tell, you now can't find a Pampers wipe that doesn't contain citric acid, which causes our kiddo's skin to turn bright red (which is quite painful). We switched to a Huggies senstive wipe which doesn't have citric acid. It's not as good as the old Pampers Sensitive, which we hope the company will choose to reintroduce.So, if your kid suddenly starts reacting badly to wipes, it's worth checking the package to see if something has changed. In this instance, Pampers has made the produce much less 'sensitve.'"
3,buy anywhere else,"Usually Amazon has fair prices, and normally I wouldn't let Amazon's pricing affect my rating of an item, but Amazon's price is crazy compared to what these wipes cost at even the supermarket. I can buy a 6 pack for $11, not on sale at the grocery store. I'm sure WalMart or Target would even be a little cheaper. So anything over $22 is a ripoff.As for the wipes, I like them but they have seemed to change and do not seem as soft as they used to be. Too bad!"
1,You Can Get 420 Count at WalMart for Under $10 plus Tax,"What a joke! This item sells for 6 packs (420 count) at Walmart for under $10 plus Tax. To get the amount that is sold here, buy two boxes of six packs from WalMart and pay ONLY under $20 plus tax. I don't know about you, but $10 in savings is worth it, even hauling children with me ages 2 and 3."
5,"wipes are fabulous, Amazon price is terrible.","These wipes are terrific. They are the only wipes I can use without my son breaking out in a rash (I've tried different brands). Amazon's price is horrible. As a new mom, I first bought them here, and I was shocked to see them in stores for 1/3rd of the price. I learned my lesson. I emailed Amazon to complain, but I never received a response. So, I'd recommmend the wipes, but buy them elsewhere (Target, Kmart, BabiesRUs, etc.)."
1,"Lousy Wipes, Huggies are Better","I bought these on Sale at Target, thinking that since I wanted to try the ""extra gentle"" wipes, that theese were a better buy than Huggies. (From which I usually purchase the Natural Care Fragrance Free)They have turned out to be nothing but a waste of money, having to use twice as many to get a job done that could have been accomplished with 1-1.5 Huggies wipes. The Huggies can torn on half if you want to. (But they don't rip while you're using them) These Pampers are tough, and if you manage to tear one in half, you're left with all these scratchy, stringy fibers on one side. Ugh. Not a pleasant experience... imagine how a baby would feel. They are also VERY dry, and I have actually found them to BE irritating to my own sensitive skin. And if you try using these for a BIG mess, forget it. You'll wind up needing the entire 72-count package.Overall, bad deal and not worth it."
5,Love Them!,I love using these wipes with my sons sensitive skin. They don't have anything added to them that he might have a reaction to.
3,Not good for my Breastfed Baby,"I really like the texture of the wipes and hope to be able to use them in the future. However, my breastfed baby gets his diaper changed a lot and these wipes turned his little bum red, red, red! I have to disagree with their claim that the wipes ""are gentler than a washcloth and water."" A washcloth and water is exactly what I use instead of wipes and my baby's bum is as perfect as the day he was born! When he was 2 1/2 months old I tried to use them again with the same results and went back to water and washcloth. I'll try again when he is on solid food and doesn't have as many dirty diapers. I do use them when we're out and about and that seems to be ok but I definitely can't use them regularaly."
2,Check the experation dates!,My only concern with the product was that the experation date had already past by the time I had recieved the product.. I am expecting and was hoping to stock up for baby but when I had seen that they were past the experation date it made me not want to order wipes from here again..
1,couldn't hate these wipes more.,"I'm very.... i mean VERY frustraed with these wipes. If you have a wipe warmer FORGET THEM cause they dry up soooooooo fast! they are thin and ugh. I hate them I hate their smell and their texture and they are SO thin in comparison to huggies naturals! I'll NEVER buy these again. I'm so pissed that I got the bulk pack! Oh well, at least I'll go through them quickly since it takes 3 wipes to do the same job it only took 1 huggies wipe to do!"
5,Great Product!,"Gret Item! However, I did find that it costs less at Meijer than here.. the wipes are great, though! Huggies gave my daughter horrible diaper rash, but these are great! These do come packaged good, also. 3 big packs with 3 little packs in each one. convenient for storage."
2,too wet and too soft,"I used to use Huggies wipes. I like Huggies over Pampers. Pampers are too wet and too soft. When I take one wipe, the next wipe always come together so I end up with using a few more unnecessary wipes everytime."
2,to soft,"I don't like them because they are to soft, they don't absorbe well and don't work as well as regular wipes. They also don't do well in a wipe warmer.I prefer huggies wipes."
1,Not Delivered,"We would like to order this product and we do like this product but, the last time we ordered from Amazon, we were notified that this could not be filled, therefore the order was cancelled."
5,A lyrical journey for old and young.,"Daniel Kirk's rich paintings are surpassed by his prose. It reads like a lullabye, which it is to a bygone era. My 3 year old and I agree that this is our favorite book, and we have hundreds."
5,FAST EDDIE RULES!,"ALTHOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE ONE OF FASTWAYS BETTER RECORDS, IT'S STILL WORTH LISTENING TO. THIS SAME LINEUP DID ANOTHER EFFORT INTITLED, ""BAD BAD GIRLS"" WHICH IS MUCH BETTER AND DELIVERS A NICE MODERN ROCK PUNCH. UNFORTUNATELY IT IS OUT OF PRINT NOW BUT IF MAY BE LOCATED AS AN IMPORT SOMWHERE. THIS WAS THE LAST TITLE FOR FASTWAY AS A GROUP, FAST EDDIE CLARKE RECENTLY RELASED, ""IT AINT OVER TILL ITS OVER"" AND CONTINUES TO WORK ON SOLO MATERIAL."
2,A commercial flop,"How can a man say that Fasyway was better without Dave King? And then to contradict yourself by saying TRICK OR TREAT was their best record.......Anyways, this record is more on par with like, say Journey or Foreigner or something. If you like your hard rock a little on the lighter side give this a try. If you like it harder and dirtier buy the Dave King records. The original version of Fastway was more like AC/DC mixed with Led Zeppelin at their heaviest......"
1,I couldn't close it around my son's stomach,This was a complete waste of money. I could lock the tray into place. He was only 10 months old at the time. I'd ONLY get this is your child is extremely tiny for their age. As in 3 month early preemie.
3,Not very happy,I got this as a gift.I was very excited to use this booster for my son who is 10 months old.It seems to be ok as a booster without back support which comes off if the toddler leans back on it too hard.Also the straps are not good enough to hold the seat to the chair.This product doesnt seem promising in terms of safety.Doesnt justify the brand name-safety 1st.I may have to buy a better one soon.
1,DO NOT BUY- UNSAFE,"I bought this booster thinking that SAFETY 1st would only make great products but I was wrong. The chair straps loosen very easily and my kid fell off the chair still harnessed in the booster. The swing part of the tray is a seperate piece screwed in which broke for the SECOND time, the first time I got a replacement tray. I would not recommend this booster to anyone who cares about their kids."
1,Don't buy this product,"I had a bad feeling when I first tried strapping this to one of my kitchen chairs and I couldn't get it real tight. Then I noticed after a few days of use that I was always havening to check the straps to the chair and around my 25lb child. They always loosened up. One of the restraint straps that go around my child kept coming out of the back of the chair. It wasn't holding him in anymore. Finally one morning a restraint strap came out again and he flipped the chair by leaning sideways. He ended up upside down on a tile floor with the kitchen chair and booster on top of him. Thank God he wasn't hurt. I called Safety 1st and they are picking up the product from my house for testing since it's a new product and sending me a different booster. Hopefully this one will be ""safe""."
1,Not Safe!,"We have 2 of these for our daughter and son. Tray comes off too easily, and the part that keeps tray attached broke off on one. Backs pop off with little effort. And worst of all, the straps come out of the seat back very easily. Our daughter leaned forward and Fell out of her chair! Our son leaned over the side, the opposite strap came out of the seat sending our son and the entire chair to the ground! We have sent the seats back to the company. They are being great about this, but are only able to send us new seats of the same model. I wish we had spent the extra $ and gotten better seats from the start."
5,Works Great,"We didn't really have the space for a stand-alone high chair, or the inclination to spend 80 or 90 dollars on one. For a kid who can sit up well, this works fine. I also have the fisher price one for the car (to use at restaurants, grandmas, etc.) and like that one as well. This was inexpensive and has worked fine. The straps stayed tightened, the swing tray fastens securely. I think I like this tray a little better than the Fisher Price booster(a snap on, because it's dishwasher safe), and the price was better (14.99 opposed to 24.99). Would buy again."
1,Junk.,"This seat is hard to secure and falls a part with light use.I've only had it for about a month. Don't waste your money on this one, I'm looking for a replacement today!"
1,Not very safe,"After taking the seat out of the chair to adjust the height, the straps would no longer work properly. The straps on booster seat would not stay tight and the seat was entirely too loose and unacceptable to use. Would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Great for Smaller Babies,"I immediately fell in love with this booster because it is incredibly easy to clean, which is why I bought it. We didn't have any problems setting it up and I love how convenient the swing tray is. The big problem now is that my daughter is already outgrowing it and she's only 10 months. The tray is too snug against her belly. She weighs about 22 pounds, but she's not huge for her age. The other problem is that the straps that go around her waist attach only at the bottom of the seat (think T formation) and not to the back of the seat. This means that if she leans forward without the tray in place, she could almost slide off the seat, since it doesn't attach to the back. This makes me frustrated since I can't use it with the tray or without. Will work great until your baby outgrows it like mine did."
5,Flesh Ripping Sonic Torment,"The Gods of Grind deliver four classics from their ""Symphonies of Sickness"" LP. Raw live-in-the-studio production preserves the essence of true grind. ""Reek of Putrefaction"", ""Crepitating Bowel Erosion"", ""Slash Dementia"", and ""Cadaveric Incubator of Endo-Parasites"" sound much better on this release than on the ""Symphonies"" LP. As a listener of grind-core in the late 1980's/early 1990's, I rate this a classic from that era. If you don't buy this you should be exhumed, consumed, and excreted 'til you are rotten to the gore..."
5,"I think Moneypenny would approve, don't you #1?",Shashing! Absolutly shaggadelic. ( And that's from a Brit )
3,it's ink,"It's ink. what else is there to say. Ahh, it is very expensive ink by the time I bought black and the other three (magenta, cyan, yellow) it was almost cheaper to buy a new printer"
1,LOUSY PRINTING,My pictures were turning out beautifully before I replaced the cartridges with these ones. Now my pictures totally suck. They skip and you can't tell who the people even are. Don't buy these.
2,What are we to do?,"I don't print a whole lot because these ink cartridges don't last! I hate being limited on my printing, and I thought the Epson was going to be better on ink than the other printers I've owned, but not so. Another thing that happens is the printer won't print if the color cartridges run out, so I don't even know if there's ink in the black one. It shuts down. It won't even scan! What is up with that? It doesn't need ink to scan. It tells me to replace the ink cartridges when I go to scan...."
2,Extremely low value,"It is clear that the printers are just a hook. The money you have to invest in cartridges, specially with this one, is a total rip-off.Printing quality is ok, but it is too expensive when you consider the cost ot ink. Think again if this is the kind of printer for you."
1,A HUGE waste of money,"I purchased a multi cart printer cx6000 in the hopes of SAVING on ink. The opposite was true. ALL 3 color cartridges and most of the black were empty after about 9 pages of simple text and 2 1/2 pages of ""wallet size"" prints with the quality set at medium which is the default setting. I lowered the quality to 1 notch above ""draft"" and I managed to double the life of my next set of cartridges which is miserable. I will never buy epson products again. This is outright thievery on their part."
4,Epson 69 Series DURABrite Ultra Color Ink Catridges - Multipack,The product was delivered on time and in great condition. I replaced my existing cartridges and straight away i was getting better printing quality. I wish there was the 68 Series (Hi-Capacity) catridges available which would last twice the number of papers as the 69 series.
3,Not enough ink for the money,You would think that they would at least put in more ink so you would not have to keep running out but I guess that is how Epson makes a tom of $$$$. As far as the quality of printing I do have to say it is outstanding.
1,defective cartridge- would not work,"Living in Mexico with a US printer I brought I have to order ink cartridges from the US which adds to the cost. (sorry don't know how to update that info on where I live) I just tried to replace the black cartridge and the plastic part on the cartridge that is supposed to ""click in"" did not and the printer still showed that it was out of ink. I gave up and tried yet another (and my last) cartridge and it did the same thing. They had been in their plastic and sealed in boxes so should not have been damaged.So not only did I lose the money spent on the cartridges and shipping, I cannot print until I get new ones from the US. That is approximately 3 weeks. Will I trust this again? Not only will I not trust the cartridges, the next printer (coming very soon I fear) will not be an Epson."
1,Does not work in CX6600,"Although the printer selection utility says this cartridge works in an Epson CX6600 printer, my printer does not recognize it. Do not trust the utility for verifying cartridge compatibility."
1,Poor quality!!,"This ink only works if I clean my nozzle heads each time I want to print something. Needless to say, it is a huge pain! Do not purchase this product!!!"
2,Product did not work in my printer,"These cartridges did not work in my printer. They made spots on the edges of the paper, and there were white lines in the print. We had to replace them. Will not order these again."
3,Epson ink cartriges,The ink iis fine but the quantity vs the price is not good. In less than a year I have paid about three times the cost of my printer in purchasing ink.
1,refilled Epson cartridges,I purchased re-filled Epson ink cartridges. they don't work very well.They were much cheaper than new and I thought I would give them a try.I am not very satisfied with them at all.
4,ink works well,"i have an epson stylus nx415, and i needed to get new ink cartridges. ink is so expensive, so i expect the product to work. i found this product to work as advertised. i dont think anyone is happy buying this product, but it does work, and its the cheapest legitimate epson product i could find for my printer."
1,Runs out of ink right away!,"Complete waste of money. We use our printer for infrequent personal use, and this cartridge was low on ink after two weeks. Our previous cartridge lasted over a year."
1,texas,"These are not the current prices, even if you try to shop low.It will cost up to $65.00 to get all the ink package.Once the product came with all the ink in one package for one price, now this cost is up because the black has been separated, and all the Epson ink has increased in the last year! Epson Printers are the worst I have ever used!LOOK for a different printer not EPSON STYLUS CX 8400 series for sure!!! Terrible!!! Costly....always an INK HOG and rarely works well.Experienced Buyer to late too sorry!!!"
5,great service-,Great service. My purchase was handled expediently. I would highly recommend this seller for future purchases.
1,Horrible!!!,Next time I will buy the original cartridge from Epson. this one is terrible.My prints are coming out ineligible
2,Dried out ink?,"I should have known a price this inexpensive was too good to be true. Upon installing the ink, I did a test print... the result was very light, almost green in hue. I thought perhaps it would get better after subsequent print jobs -- maybe it just needed a while to get the ink flowing -- but unfortunately I was wrong. Definitely not the quality I need."
3,works great,would like 2 be able to return old cartridges for rebate for I love doing business with U. A little higher but good PR
1,what a waste!,"Like other buyers i thought i would be getting epson cartridges, what a lie! i put them in my printer, NOTHING! they are not compatible, the printer does not recognize the cartridges. i googled the problem, now i need to by some chip resetter. i will not buy from this seller again, not totally honest about cartridges that they carry. now i have 3 black and 1 color refills of junk! and a printer that is all gummed up because the old ink dried up because the replacements didn't work!"
1,Bad experience,"Of course the item i received is not the one shown in your picture, thats the original, it came in a plane box no labels,And once installed simply it doesnt work, computers display says ""cartridge not recognize"" please change it."
3,Too bad the these cartridges are so expensive.,"The ink cartridges arrived quickly and were easy to install. They work well,but Epson charges too much. I will eventually look for a different brand printer."
2,Black cartridge did not fit.,The black cartridge did not fit. the groove shapes were different from the regular black 69 cartridge and would not insert into the printer. The other cartridges did fit.
1,It's a rip off!,"Printer ink cartridges are rip off, especially those $50 printers that uses $40 or more ink cartridges that only print about FIVE color 8x10 pictures and its empty again... No wonder the printer was so cheap!The ink cartridges are getting smaller and less on new ones than the old one, and the price didn't change either.And then you add the shipping and handling cost...? It's cheaper to buy at home, and buy a more expensive printer to make more prints lots cheaper.This was the worst deal I bought."
1,Not recognized by my Epson printer,"Wish I could give it a zero, because that's what I got out of this. I don't know if this was a knockoff or what, but my printer wouldn't even recognize it."
1,Lasted ten pages,"I returned this item. Order it, installed it, printed ten pages and then the ink was gone."
2,Expensive and runs out quick,"Despite being ""high capacity"" these run out relatively quickly.I only ended up buying this because of how Epson printers are a total scam. I only needed to print black text most of the time as a college student, however when I ran out of ""yellow"" ink, the software for the printer decides its unable to print at all despite a full black ink cartridge. I fell for the scam that Epson printers save money because they split up the RYB color cartridges. In reality they are expensive and last a fraction of the duration of ink cartridges for my past printers(I have used HP, Canon, Kodak printers prior to the Epson).I would not recommend Epson products to anyone who enjoys saving money."
1,Very high cost ink,Epson printers are ok. The ink on the other hand is crazy expensive.These cartrages have very little ink in them making the cost of operating Epson printers not good at all.
4,Epson T069120-BCS 69,"Although, it didn't come with its original box to save shipping cost, the genuine Epson ink combo pack, works just fine in my printer. Seller wants to keep prices down. Good product & great price!"
2,black ink did not last,Something was wrong with the black ink in this package.It ran out after 2 weeks. That's not normal and I had to buy another package--very expensive!
5,DuraBrite Ink Cartridge,Product was as advertised and was received very quickly after purchase. Was pleased with the product and the rapid delivery time.
1,Cartridge is Awful,I purchased this new black ink Epson brand cartridge. It does not work. Every other line is barely visible.It prints no better than an off brand recycled cartridge. I am very disappointed since mywork at home has suffered as a result of not going out to Staples and just buying it there.
4,Good Ink,Only reason i didn't give this product a five star was because I could have bought it at a traditional store for about the same price. Product arrived quick and works as expected.
5,Works great,"It prints. What else can you ask for? I'm not a fan of the printer and how much ink is used, but that is a different review!"
1,Do NOT buy from this seller!,"I ordered an Epson black ink cartridge and I received a taped shut box, obviously it had been opened before and the ink cartridge was in no vacuum seal or any other seal. There was scotch tape over the ink opening. I went ahead and tried to use it and my printer stopped printing after a week of use. They are obviously selling refilled ink cartridges and gave no indication that they were. I will not be buying from this seller again."
3,Good ink...,Came packaged nicely. We always buy this ink for our printer.. the colors are always great. I guess it depends on which printer you have but this brand always works well for us.
1,the disappearing ink,"I'm not sure the reasoning, but these cartridges are detected by my printer to be under half full. All packaging appeared to be original. Nevertheless, I'm stuck ordering more after less than a couple weeks."
3,Epson stylus 105 ink cartridge,"I have a Epson stylus 105.I am having trouble with my printer to recognize the black ink. The other colors were 88 but when i bought the black I bought the 69, i ended up replacing all of them but with the 88 cause it was cheaper and i dont print much. I am wondering if i am needing to buy the black 88, is that why it isn't recognizing it? Hopefully someone can help."
2,only got 1 cartridge,i was surprised when i got this order because i had the mistaken belief i was getting a great deal for two cartridges (which is one thing i don't like) that the printer requires to print projects. So i have a 68 (standard) and a 69 (high capacitiy) in the printer. i don't know what i'm going to do when the 68 is out and i still have 69 left (this is what i bought).I felt like I had been duped. I should have realized it was a deal too good to be true.
5,great printing,This style of cartridge is VERY easy to put in the printer and use. I have very happy with the clarity of the printing .... no smudging and clear as can be. Good product.
2,Too little ink for too much.,My major gripe with Epson ink is not quality but cost per letter. I had a four month old Epson CX9400 that drank ink and wore out in no time. I chucked it but kept the cartridges to use in the Epson Workforce 600. The Workforce 600 is head and shoulders superior and does not use nearly as much ink. The drivers do not force me to use letter quality. I have purchased replacement ink and reusable cartridges from Ink Nova through Amazon and wait to use them. I like the idea of cheaper ink and reusing cartridges. I have not had much luck with such in the past but hope that the Ink Nova inks will be superior.
4,No Name Replacement Ink,"Ink came in when it was prommised great transaction. Can not say how long ink will last, but took a while for it to get through inkjet before tru blk showed. Price was right, if ink last just 3/4 as long as name brand, will buy again."
2,Not completely Satisfied,I am not completely satisfied with this product because the Yellow cartridge ran out of ink a day after installing the cartridge in the printer. The ink monitor is working fine because it no longer indicate that the Yellow cartridge is out of ink after I installed a Best Buy bought cartridge.
3,Strane package,I try to keep one set of ink ready when I need it. The set I just received were not in the box pictured. They may be OK but just loose in an envelope?? I am not sure if they are reloads or factory new. I probably will buy from a local office supply store in the future to be on the safe side. Too bad I like to buy via Amazon.
2,dries up in the printer,"I didn't use my Epson printer much. So once the cartridges were opened and inserted into the printer, the ink dried up before I'd printed many pages. I decided to get rid of that printer."
4,"Finest quality, at a high price.","This is the original Epson brand ink cartridge. It is a very high-quality product that produces sharp, bright color printing, and they have lasted a long time, for me, so far. As long as they don't sit idle for weeks or months, they don't gum up or clog like many of the aftermarket or refilled ink cartridges will after a short time. I print between 1-20 pages per week and these ink cartridges have lasted a long time. The downside is that they are much more expensive than the lower-quality aftermarket/refilled cartridges. I'm not saying that these are a better value than the aftermarket inks, it just depends how you define value -- you can spend more for this quality product that lasts and is reliable and prints beautifully, or you can save considerable money on another, lower-quality product that might clog or produce fuzzy or dull images."
5,epson,"excelente producto lo recibi a tiempo como lo estipulo el vendedor, persona seria de alto compromiso y buen trato, lo recomiendo 100%"
1,I'm pissed at these prices,"This review isn't about how well this or any of the other TO69 cartridges work. They work fine. I'm writing because I'm peeved at how RIDICULOUSLY expensive these things are. $5. That's it. That's all I think they're worth and what I think a fair price is. It shouldn't cost me what I pay to fill up my tank with gas, or what it costs for a month of cellphone service for one phone, or the price of w wireless-N router, to put INK into my printer. Even if Epson is trying to make up the difference on a low balled printer, at these prices they should have made their money off one set of replacements. Geez this is a crappy way to treat customers."
1,junk,"bought a new ink cart. for my printer. but some of the jets are screwy, and wont print right. you get what you pay for. ill buy wal mart next time."
5,Very Good! TaTrix ink cart. for Epson.,"Purchased from Ta-Trix. Ordered this product for my Epson NX100 inkjet printer/scanner. Says MADE IN CHINA on the box. They arrived three days after I ordered them. Ink cartridges were professionally packaged with written instructions on how to install. Slightly different appearance than regular Epson cartridges. Went ahead and installed three cartridges: cyan, black and magenta. No problems whatsoever. No error messages. Went ahead and printed out a picture of a flower. Flawless. Printer companies have been ripping us off for way to long. I am very thankful to have found this product at such a reasonable price."
1,Rip Off!,"Sure I bought my printer on sale and for a good price, but the outrageous cost of ink makes the printer an expensive and useless paper weight. I replaced the ink cartridges just a few weeks past and since then I have printed about 100 pages before I ran out of ink. $55.00 for 100 pages is not a bargain. I am tossing the printer in the trash today. Although Kinkos is less convenient, they make good prints. It is a sad world - they get you coming and going."
2,Eh...you're better off getting them from Costco,"8/8/12 -- Update: Even though Costco raised their prices, which led me to give Epson a less than stellar review elsewhere on Amazon, Costco is still the place to get these. Even if it does pain me to pay over $50 to put ink in my printer.Guess I should have read the text more thoroughly instead of looking at the picture. Because for the same price I could have gotten these ink cartridges AND TWO black ink cartridges at Costco. Oh well. Live and learn I guess. Also, because there wasn't anything wrong with the product, the cost of the return was on my nickel. So, needless to say future purchases will be from, did I already say, Costco? Other than that it's Epson ink. I'm not sure if that's a good thing though when 4 complete sets of cartridges cost me the same as a new printer. :-("
1,Can't complete printout,"Just purchased Epson 69 standard capacity ink cartridges. Printed out an ebook, so I thought.Got to page 86 (set on b/w only and text only on the printer), it stopped and said the black was empty.SERIOUSLY.......PAGE 86. THAT'S ALL. Come on.....what good is this package of ink. There should be a message onhow many pages it will print. A total waste of money and time."
2,Short Life on a So So Printer,"This is probably a quality ink but considering its short life and the less than quality Epson printer it is designed for, I can't recommend it. Save your money and buy a Canon. I know that most ink jet ink cartridges don't last long but these cartridges seemed to have a VERY short life."
1,Stylus Color CX5000 and CX6000 Durabrite Magenta Ink,I just used it for about 3-5 times. In a simple file. Theres not much color on the files. And then Its already empty. All of the 3 ink jets i purchased is already empty.
1,THIS INK DID NOT WORK!!!!!!,"I'm so frustrated with this. I replaced all colors from the multipack, as well as a black ink purchased on Amazon. Everything was properly packaged in the Epson packaging but when I went to install the new cartridges, none of the ink levels were full. As a matter of fact, there was a warning that the yellow and cyan inks were expended and needed to be replaced. I can't clean the print heads or do a nozzle check, because Epson does not allow you to perform these tasks while ANY ink is empty."
1,Don't Buy From This Seller,"DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER...Seller listed items with photos and text Epson Originals refurbished, using UltraBrite inks. Contacted seller why order is 1-week late shipping, when already emailed Tracking Number, said order canceled because I gave him 1-star rating for last order, 25-percent ink full and only makes lines. Poorest Quality product I have ever used. So this means, if you don't give sellers 5-star ratings, you can't buy from them anymore? I reported him to Epson USA which said he cannot legally use their images, text and specifications - selling Generics. Also reported to Amazon POOR business Code of Ethics. I think Epson USA will be contacting seller and Amazon about falsely soliciting business...."
3,Epson stylus ink replacement - good but quickly runs out,"Epson stylus ink replacement is good but quickly runs out; don't understand why printer has to use color ink to print out black and white documents, therefore, making the colored inks run out faster. I think it's a gadget by Epson to make people buy their ink cartridges."
1,Waste of money!,When I changed my ink cartridge in my Epson printer says it is not compatible and now my printer does not work because it thinks there is no ink in it. I have had this printer for about 2 years and all of the other ink cartriges I've purchased for it have worked except these. Now I have to by more ink cartriges because the set I bought from this seller don't work. Complete waste of money!
4,its an inkjet cartridge,This cartridge does seem to last longer than generic versions. Ink levels don't deplete too quickly and the print looks good on paper.
5,"Great Product, Best Price",This is a great way to buy printer ink. I found it to be the cheapest way also! Definitely worth it!
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER...,"DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER...Seller listed items with photos and text Epson Originals refurbished, using UltraBrite inks.

1,Not for Stylus cx6600,This Epson 69 pack does not work in the Stylus cx6600 printer. The cartridges are smaller than the T0441-2-3-4 original cartridges and are not recognized by the printer. This is the second time I have ordered these as the drop-down says they are compatible with the CX6600. Please don't make the same mistake.
3,Product is great. Amazon shipping not so,The product is great and I think the Epson printers are awsome.Amazon shipped this product in a paper enveloped and it arrived all torn and smootched.
2,"Beautiful Ink, ""empty"" cartridges","I'll never buy another Epson, because I never want to deal with expensive, prematurely ""empty"" cartridges again. My Canon inkjet was much, much cheaper to use. Even when printing black only, my color cartridges go ""empty"" within weeks (and yes, I've selected ""Black"" in the ""Print Settings""). Also, when any cartridge is empty, my CX6000 will not print (even if it's a color cartridge and I'm printing B/W). Every time I use my printer I love the results, but they're tainted with the feeling of being ripped off. Beautiful and durable ink, yes, but not worth a fortune."
2,cost to high,works like ink what can you say about computer ink. i need eight more words to send this. done now.
5,Fully Satisfied,The order was punctually received and the items was exactly as specified. I am fully satisfied and I would order again.
3,"I really hate buying ink, but this seems to last longer than most","I've bought the generic ink which tends to be hit or miss, and I really hate buying printer ink. There's cheaper alternatives, but I'm just tired of rolling the dice and hoping the off-brand catridge I bought will work. So congrats Epson, I'm buying your ink only because its not worth the hassle to try another generic brand. If anyone knows of a cheaper, dependable alternative I love to hear from you."
5,No problem,No problems with product. Excellent service. Very fast service. Cartridges work perfectly in my Workforce 30 printer. Would not hesitate to reccomend to a friend.
4,Only docked a star for price,"Obviously, you can not do better than genuine Epson ink. The price is still a little too high for me, so we try to use this printer less than our very cheap to print on HP officejet."
1,Wrong Product,"When I opened this packet it contained two cartridges of yellow ink, NOT black! This is not what I paid for."
4,Epson International Printers ?,"This a good news - bad news review. My Epson Stylus printer/copier/scanner NX110came from Florida USA. When it needed ink in the UK there was none available. I had to order and pay freight from America and then when it was delivered it came from Sweden of all places. Sure I finally got it but it makes an Epson a very expensive beast to keep fed with ink and surely questions the international status of Epson.Good news of course was that when UK retailers couldn't supply, Amazon came up trumps."
2,Durabrite Ultra 69 Series Ink Black (T069120),"The Durabrite Ultra 69 Series Ink Black (T069120)came in a very timely manner and in good shape,there was an issue with the item but after contacting the seller,he fixed the problem in a very timely manner and I would order from him again."
2,Stories have been translated better in other collections,"Though the book claims that this collections translates most of these stories for the first time, almost all of them have appeared in English in other books previously. Zipes' translations are fairly clunky and do not capture the nuances of Hesse's original text -- nor do they match up to previously translated collections of Hesse's shorter works. You'd be better of hunting down Hesse's stories at the used book stores."
3,Importance of Imagination...,"Herman Hesse takes us back to the basics of imagination and dreaming. The stories do transmit very essential concepts of life principles and the way to pursue what we believe in...Very easy reading, the humor in some of the stories takes you by surprise since the transition between the different stages of the story is just so smooth...A book that will take you places, and make you have conversations you always thought not possible..."
3,Underwhelming Approach to the Fairy Tale Genre,"Hermann Hesse's fairy tales cover themes -- the illusion of progress, the inextricable and absurd cruelty of humans, the power of art -- that he addresses in other works. With the exception of ""Dr. Knoegle's End,"" which amusingly describes a hippie colony one could easily imagine in contemporary San Francisco, the tales are basically underwhelming. They're too earnest, use metaphors that are too transparent, and don't provide particularly insightful perspectives on the issues. I was much more impressed by the collection of fairy tales by Kurt Schwitters, who was a contemporary of Hesse, held some similar views as Hesse, and was also translated by Jack Zipes."
5,Finally!!,"I have been looking for this album by Randy Brown for over 25 years!! I wasn't able to even find one person who had ever even heard of it. When I found it last night (Christmas 2003),on Amazon.com, I was almost afraid it wasn't the right one. But there was a place where I could listen to the samples. I almost lost my mind. This is my favorite album in all my 42 years!! Thank you Amazon.com for making a long lost dream come true...and just in time for Christmas!!!! Randy Brown is second to none!!!"
2,Poor finish quality on the outside,Just received the yellow 4-Piece Starter set. The set appears to be of second quality. The outside is not smooth. Tiny bubble marks can be seen and felt. There are some lumpy spots on the outside. There are also scratchy marks on the bottom. We compare this set with other Emile Henry products we have and we are very disappointed with the quality of this set. Emily Henry's quality control is totally absent with this set.
1,worst transfer so far!,"These are the worst picture quality of my 90 blu-ray movies. Some of the scenes are pretty good, but most of it is awful. 1 extra-a featurette on the movie. I'll bet they're coming out w/ a better version soon. Maybe a 4-pack jack ryan set like on regular dvd. They did this re-release thing w/ Terminator 2 already! All 4 of the Jack Ryan series looks like crap on blu. Is it better than dvd? Yes, so only buy it if it is a must-have for you."
2,Good harness but horrible seller!!!,The harness is good but it says Digi camo it came in woodland camoflauge and it says + 2 pods mine didnt come with any.DO NOT BUY THESE FROM HERE!!!!
2,"Questionable, sloppy tabs","As another reviewer noted, there are indeed some suspect, if not sloppy and downright incorrect, tabs in this book. ""You Shook Me All Night Long"" begins with a composite tab of what sounds to me like multiple/overdubbed rhythm parts, without acknowledging multiple rhythm parts. Some rhythm and solo parts of that same song seem to be tabbed flat-out wrong, for that matter. The book doesn't even bother to transcribe the outro solo to ""Back in Black.""The only other AMSCO tab book I've bought, a Black Sabbath anthology, is equally weak."
3,INCORECT TABS!,"Beware when purchasing any AMSCO books that tab AC/DC.... some are correct, but alot, infact TOO MANY are tabbed incorectly... i dont just mean there in wrong positions... i mean they havent even tabbed the same song... its half and half with this book... half the songs are ok and correct.... half are bad and sloppy...dont pay any more then $10 for this. There is too much that is incorect. AMSCO dont even take the time to realise they have incorect tabs, because there still putting the same WRONG tabs into there latest books! Avoid AMSCO, or dont pay alot."
3,Heart Like A Wheel,"While I admire her Racing ability and the movie sure depicts that,I do not admire her private personal life,Yes Her First Husband what he did was not Right but how can you leave behind a Son?""If you Need anything Call Grandma""..yes later he worked for her,And then go off with a Talented yet Creep Like Connie? Her life would have been alot more interesting if she had more morals,The racing footage is good And the Early 50s Drags as well As the Corvette,But This whole WomenLib/Fem/PostFeminist mumbo jumbo cannot take away the fact you would leave a Kid behind for Ambition,I dont care if your a Woman,Man,Green or blue. Anyways my favorite Feminist is Phyllis Schafly. the movie is worth watching but she ain't no hero."
5,Great movie!,Great movie! Have seen it several times...love it every time. Definitely recommend buying it.
4,"Nice, pleasant scent. Not overpowering. Probably more suitable ...","Nice, pleasant scent. Not overpowering. Probably more suitable for women than men. Does a good job of controlling odor, but of course, it's not an antiperspirant, so it doesn't control perspiration. The product glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly, so there's no mess."
3,Fat Beats on a downslope,"Actually this release starts out a little weak, but tends to get better every song. That is if you can stand drum and bass and trance. After a while things start to get a little tedious, but somehow, a little change in the sounds start to pop up making you pay attention to the record. Most of the songs come out sometimes innovative, but tend to keep the same mood as most songs in the genre. This cd is a good listen, but may not be accesible to many listeners. Even though its fun and entertaining to listen to, after a while you prefer to pick up other cds."
1,"Too small, throw it back","This charm was so small, it didn't match any I already have. It was advertised as on sale for $99. At this tiny size, it was no bargain, even on sale. I returned it."
4,Plees updeight th' speling for moderne readeres,"I agree with all the positive things said about Donne on this page. Also, this book's great strength is its breadth, including poems, letters, sermons, and other writings of Donne. One gets all the poems and most of his available prose. The only difficulty I had is that all of the poems are presented without any effort to modernize the spelling of words. Often, this distracts from a more perfect enjoyment of Donne's wit, sentiment, conceits and emotions. For those who might find antiquated spelling a distraction, I recommend they find another edition."
4,A Standard Collection,This is the best collection of Donne poetry in its price range. It has all the poems and most of the prose you are likely to need for most classes that cover Donne. It could be even more affordable if Modern Library would make the work available for the Kindle.
3,Beautiful But Hard to Understand,"I bought this book because it was referenced in a book and movie I love, ""84 Charing Cross Road"". In the movie, Anne Bancroft's character quotes a breathtaking beautiful John Donne passage and falls in love with his writing. She states she's, ""dizzy with Donne"".However, I failed to do my research. If I had, I'd have realized that Donne was a 17th Century writer whose English was very different than my 21st Century version. Although Donne's sermons, prose, and verse are eloquent, it takes a minimum of three readings of every line for me to understand them.I'm working my way through the material, very slowly and learning to appreciate Donne's brillianceI would recommend this book to scholars and those who have the interest and patience to ""translate"" archaic language and sentiments. Otherwise, get the Clif's notes.."
2,Very Disappointed,"This umbrella is much heavier than other similarly sized automatics. Also, after you close it you have to mess with 2 straps to wind around the umbrella. Just kind of a pain."
5,great mid size umbrella for travel.,Compact and well made. Probably will order the even smaller type from these guys as I had one smaller that fit in my pocket and saved the day in Rome when it poured unexpectedly. So even smaller is more my speed-though this size is much more compact than the norm.
1,Horrible,"I got this umbrella for Christmas. The company mistakenly sent two so I gave the second away. Big mistake. My umbrella lasted only 3 uses and then got stuck in the open position. I took advantage of the lifetime warranty, sent it back and received a similar London Fog umbrella as a replacement. This one lasted for 4 uses and then got stuck in the closed position. An incredible disappointment. I've heard that Windbrella makes better windproof umbrellas."
1,Defective,I purchased 2 Rainkist Razor Automatic Open & Close Windefyer umbrellas as gifts. Both were defective and did not open or close.
1,"Umbrella won't open, Poor warranty service","This umbrella broke the second time that I used it. The umbrella will not stay open and I believe that there is a broken spring in the central shaft of the umbrella.Futai is the company that manufactures this umbrella and the umbrella has a lifetime warranty. However, I just spoke with Stephanie at Futai 732-225-0416, and she said to send her a check for $10.00.A lifetime warranty where one has to pay 2/3 of the purchase price to get the product repaired is not really a lifetime warranty. It is more like a lifetime service program with a $10.00 repair fee.I will definitely avoid purchasing any Futai products in the future.I hope that this review helps someone."
2,Was good when it worked,"The closing mechanism failed after one year of very light use. Manufacturer offers ""Unconditional Lifetime Warranty"" which I have not tried. But the point is, the auto open/close mechanism should not fail so quickly. I am not alone, you will notice there are so many other customers facing the same problem with this product."
5,Good for talking,"I had this as a small child and found it really useful. Some things in it may seem a little dated, but the basic coverage of the book is excellent. It deals with important but difficult to discuss issues. It's written in a format where children can either read with their parents or read alone, and so find out important facts at their own pace."
5,Exactly what I was hoping for...,This arrived very quickly. I wanted the book for reference and it was exactly what I wanted. It was in perfect condition. I was very happy with this order.
5,Evidential Power of Beauty,"Great book--doesn't completely overcome my doubts about God, but comes close. Everyone should read the chapters on the maxi, midi, and mini marvels we come in contact with every day."
5,A life-changing experience,"We read this book in our book-discussion group. Every one of us found that this book had a significant, positive impact on our world outlook. Reading the book was a life-changing experience that gave us a new wonderment of the universe and its Creator."
3,Better than most things out there,"Like most die hard fans I guess I just end up liking the previous albums bands make over their newer ones most of the time. As you can witness on the dvd this album had a lot of last minute in the studio ideas especially on Randy's part. It serves as a docu closely resembling metallicas ""Moster"" dvd. This band is not always hanging and jammin together when it comes to the music. This cd sounds very influenced by Slipknot, Testament and Pantera. Was hoping for some more chunk in the music ala Meshuggah like the boys used to do. I think Mastodon has the right idea when it comes to being the NWOAM champs."
1,Another exploitation of devout Lamb of God fans,"I am incensed right now after wasting ANOTHER $20 on this. As a loyal Lamb of God fan, I expected the band to do right by it's fans and deliver a great idea (producer edition,) but instead I feel RIPPED OFF. First of all, there is no software on the disc. Other artists have given fans the ability to mix songs on their CDs (Lily Allen ""Alright, Still) and there was software contained on the CD allowing users to mix the tracks. So, now I'm scouring the internet looking for a trial version of mixing software and wasting hours looking for something relatively simple to use that doesn't end up costing me more money. Don't waste your money or time on this cash grab by the band and their label."
5,HOW CAN YOU COMPARE METALLICA WITH LAMB OF GOD?,"There is no comparison, Lamb Of God would chew the non-metal Metallica up and spit them out-and then write a song about it! I enjoy the good ol' metal days as well, but some times you just have to open up another cold beer and throw something heavier in and this is that album. Sacrament rocks from beginning to end with no mercy. I really enjoyed seeing Lamb Of God blow Slipknot off of the stage a few years back and this year they are touring with Slayer! Speaking of Slayer, buy this C.D. with Slayers-Christ Illusion C.D. and you are in for a hell of a treat."
3,Listened once so far. So far I'm Dissapointed,"It sounds like Lamb of God is past their prime. Of course I'm judging it by the standards they set in their previous albums. ""As the Palaces Burn"" and ""Ashes of the Wake"" blew me away more than any metal album EVER. Too me, ""Sacrement"" is just boring. Every song sounds the same. It's like they decided to make an album without much creative material. And to be honest a lot of the guitar riffs seem wimpy. It just doesn't have the amazing caotic moments I live for as a Lamb of God fan.Well I'll give it another listen and hope I enjoy it more."
5,This time the lamb does the slaughter!,"For awhile now I never really liked lamb of god but I decided to go ahead and buy this cd after already owning Ashes in the Wake and discovered a new must have band for any metalhead's collection. This band kicks your [...] from the start to the finish on this cd. I have become a serious lamb of god fan now and I listen to this cd and ashes all the time now. All their political digs aside which I don't fully agree with this band has a killer sound and the vocals make them even better they fit the type of brutallity you hear when you play songs like Walk with me in Hell,or Redneck. This band is one of best in American metal alongside Killswitch of course. I would recomend this cd to anybody who likes brutal,heavy hard hitting metal that kicks [...] from start to finish."
3,Not the best of 2007,"This album is template Metal at its best and you wont find anything new here. Sure, these guys are awesome musicians and the songs are good but it offers nothing new. You dont have to buy this album. If you want something new, then go grab Mastodon's Blood Moutain or the Frenchy Gojira's From Mars to Sirius or even Killswitch Engage As Daylight Dies. Those will fill up you ears way hell more!"
4,"Good. Very good. Well,not very good,but good","I just received my LOG:Sacrament CD and i am quite dissapointed on how they took care of the disc casing. The back of the casing has three cracks,BIG BIG cracks,big cracks that i goes in and out. But the interior was ok though. About the shipment,well,i was stated that after the shipping it would take over a month to ship from the USA to Malaysia. But instead it came to my home wayy less than a month,i was shocked and jumped with joy when i finally got my hands on the CD! Anyway,my country Malaysia doesn't sell LOG CDs,well they used to,then don't know why of all a sudden..Anyway,it's one hell of a LambOfGod.. \m/"
3,Nothing new here,"this album is really just a 'blah' album to me. and it really irritates me when bands use phrases like 'rising' and whatnot because it's just so overused, you'll find that sort of rubbish on the track 'again we will rise'. anyways this album isn't really a bad album, it's just not very good. do yourself a favor and go listen to some better music. you owe it to yourself.bands you should listen to instead:opethkalmahchildren of bodomnortherensiferumfinntrollmirrorthronein flamesarsisthose are just a few..."
2,Worst vocals ever recorded...,Music is decent but the vocals make me want to kill myself.Unless that's the idea.
1,a genuine waste of time,"I saw these guys in Nashville warming up for Metallica...I can see why they picked them...to make themselves look SOOOOO much better...because they are indeed...LOG literally lived up to their abbreviation and make me nod off to sleep on a couple of occasions during their set....and the lead singer appeared to be struggling to belt out the next line to whatever song they happen to be singing...these guys are just awful and anyone like ""barbarian"" who thinks differently and research a bit to discover what true metal sounds like...and believe me folks, this ain't it!"
1,garbage,"what happened to log? they sold out, they play garbage poseur rock so that people who want to be metal heads will buy their stuff. they've lost all their heaviness and i've lost all my respect for them, this is total 'scene' metal at it's worst!!!NOT TO MENTION THEY TOTALLY BIT OFF OF MORBID ANGEL'S ""COVENANT"" FOR THEIR COVER ART!!! ARGGGG!"
4,American Metal with No Prisoners Taken Alive,"Lamb of God has established themselves as metal royalty, and deserves to be spoken of as such. They absolutely shred live. I saw them with Shadows Fall (another upper echelon band), and they destroyed everyone there. When I think of pure metal, LOG is one of the first bands to pop in my head.This album isn't as good as Ashes of the Wake, but it is about on par with As the Palaces Burn. However, there are some songs on here that push the boundaries of what anyone could reasonably expect from them, and leave you wondering just how awesome of a career these dudes will have. If you consider yourself a metalhead, you need to add LOG to your collection. I give this 4.5 stars."
2,man......,"i was pretty psyched for this record. i don't listen to metal much anymore because it's all getting a bit too one dimensional and this record really brought my observation to light. only good songs here are ""Walk w/ me in Hell"", ""Again We Rise"", ""Redneck"" and ""Descending"". on past LOG albums they threw us a little curveball on the final song of each record but here.. ugh. ""Beating On Death's Door"" is so horrible! just like the rest of the album it's very generic and by the numbers metal.don't get me wrong. i love Lamb of God.. i've seen them three times, once on each album tour but i'm not going to see them for this one. i hate to say it but it's cliche metal. very disappointing."
5,PURE AMERICAN METAL !!!!,"No pretense or manufactured image here, just pure metal from open to close! There is a lot going on and it took me a few listens to get fully into this, but once I did I was hooked! The production is flawless and the drums are the best I have ever heard...they sound like bullets being fed thru a machine gun! The Adlers have the best drum/guitar syncopation going, and every song has a riff that makes your blood boil. ""Descending"" is a nice departure for them and accoring to the latest DVD - almost didn't make the cut...I'm glad they kept it because it does show some growth for the band. The closing track ""Beating On Death's Door"" is my favorite, and has frantic drums and guitars flying all over the place. I just saw them on the Unholy Alliance tour with Slayer, and I fully expect them to crush Megadeth and the rest on Gigantour!"
1,rip offs,"I've been listening to metal for over a decade. I read the reviews of this album, and they were good. And even though when I gave their earlier stuff a listen I was as bored with them as I am with Linkin Park, I still got the new one. The vocals are stupid. Really. The songs are completely unmoving. I really, really tried to like this. And even though the guitar is very good, very strong, the songs are very unoriginal. There are truly good moments on this album, I agree, but this band is NOT the great band people claim they are. They are not distinguished. They aren't even easy to like a little bit because of the stupid stupid vocals. Truly annoying. They butcher every song. Lastly they sound like they are just regurgitating metal cliches in every song. I know most people are going to disagree with me, but just like the James Blunt fans ( I like LOG more than Blunt, I'll give them that), they are deluded. LOG is, overall, NOT THAT GOOD."
2,Nice at first but...,"Bought this clock radio about six months ago. As stated above, display is bright, but not unnecessarily so. Radio sensitivity is very good. Sound quality is very good. Alarm indicator on clock face very useful. Buzzer sound level adjustment on rear panel.Durability is poor. Radio volume stopped being adjustable. Opening the radio (impossible without breaking a few plastic clips) to check if I could fix it myself showed that a tiny pin on the volume thumbwheel broke, and is not possible to glue back together. Even if it were possible to re-glue the part, it would only break again or damage the volume potentiometer. Everyday controls should last longer than six months. Will not waste time with warranty claim; shipping costs would be higher than the cost of a new clock-radio. Will not purchase Sony again. Not recommended if you actually want to use the controls."
4,Buy it for Vitali and Brahms,"No need to write on David Oistrakh, the greatest violinist that Russia ever had.I buy this CD for Vitali's Chaconne played with an extreme virtuosity characteristic to Oistrakh's mastering of the instrument. There are also three Hungarian Dances by Brahms beautifully played. The sound for these pieces which I mentioned are good and clear.As for the rest, it is unfortunate that the remastering has compressed those pieces and reduced the sound quality. Golovanov was a great Russian conductor, and these two works by Mozart and Beethoven could have been a fine testimony if they had been recorded and remastered better. Well, but that is all you get, but you can enjoy if you have an ear for historical recordings and mono sound. I just give 4 stars solely for the sound quality of some of the pieces. Otherwise, it is a good CD."
2,More of the same old same old,"I bought this CD because I heard the artists version of ""Alive,"" which happens to be the original one of the song heard in revamped form on Paul Van Dyk's ""Out There and Back."" I bought the CD used from amazon.com, and, after my first listen I was glad that I did not spend the money and pay full price. Aside from ""Alive,"" there are only two other songs that I found tolorable, ""Walls"" and ""Rose Colored Glasses.""..."
3,Ok light but cannot be installed vertically,"If you try to install this on a vertical board, say on a headboard as a reading lamp, it just falls over limply. Since I would imainge this is one of the main reasons people would buy this lamp, that seems like a handicap. It works better if installed on a horizontal board, such as the edge of a desk. And it would be easier to use if it had a switch on the lamp coard instead of on top of the lampshade, which gets hot if you use an incandescent bulb."
5,The Best Pilates DVD I have Seen,"I love The Quick & Dirty Guide to Salsa so I was curious about The Quick & Dirty Guide to Pilates. Wow. This DVD is incredibly well done. We all know about the multi-angle part but now you can also design your own workout. You can re-arrange your Pilates routine so easily that there is no reason to get bored with the same routine anymore.The instructor Laura Hames has a great voice, personality and a clear accent. You got to check her out. She is really good. She sounds like an angel with the music. Though the music on this DVD is very gentle and soothing, you can also turn the music off. I prefer my own workout music and this is my most favorite feature.Overall, this DVD is so fun that it will put a smile on your face. Bring out that mat. Highly recommended."
1,"Very Simplistic, Not Pilates","I bought this DVD to supplement Brooke Siler's ""The Pilates Body"" because I wanted to understand some of the beginning exercises better by seeing them in action. I was very disappointed in I received. The exercises amount to simple calisthenics and include very few elements of a standard Pilates mat program. I'm no fitness guru but doing the entire program hardly raised my pulse or challenged my muscles.The DVD format itself is quite nice. If you are looking for some very low-intensity stretches and warmup exercises, this is a great DVD to get. However, calling this a Pilates DVD is a misrepresentation of its content."
3,pilates for beginners,"""The Quick and Dirty Guide to Pilates: Part I"" is a pilates workout video for beginners. The word ""beginners"" should be stressed here. I do not know the first thing about pilates, but the exercises contained on this DVD are quite simple.The workouts are led by Laura Hames and she explains what she is doing in a very soft and soothing voice, one which can quite possibly put the viewer to sleep (but hey, maybe that's what pilates is). There are twenty three chapters on this DVD, each one a different exercise or motion for pilates.The entire DVD is approximately two hours and the entire feature is multi-angle, so by pushing the ""angle"" button on your remote you can see each movement from a different angle.This is a very slow, deliberate workout dvd. Very low intensity and I will say that this is going to be very easy for the beginner to pick up and learn. Those who are more experienced will be very bored by this."
3,"Nice try, maybe next time...buy worth it for POWER LUNCH!","Har Mar does ""ironic"" as well as anyone else, but the ""joke"" of a white-boy doing his own brand of plastic fake funk wears a bit thin over the course of one CD - clearly, he's been studying his old PRINCE LPs, cause this comes off like VANILLA ICE meets THE PURPLE ONE...but that's not necessary a bad thing. The boy can't rap, or maybe he's not trying? Key cuts are the supremely sexy electro-funk of POWER LUNCH (begs for a video, get this on MTV now!) and EZ PASS - both of which deserved to be hits, if WB put some $$ marketing muscle behind it - but they didn't, so now you can find this for cheap in the bargain bins. Oh well. Nice try, mayb next time?"
3,Lend Me A Tenor,"A first rate production - just don't expect palm trees and temples - great conductor - but Lend Me A Tenor! Nakajima just doesn't make the grade in singing or acting. His big duet with Grassi just falls flat. The two voices aren't compatible and there isn't an ounce of genuine affection or friendship shown between the two men. This is also not the regular version of Pearl Fishers you are used to hearing. There are more choral arrangments which were interesting to hear. If you must have a PEARL FISHERS, I suppose this will work even if there are a few moments you will cringe over the tenor. Good luck!"
4,Strong Venice production,"A surprisingly strong performance taped live in Venice's Teatro Malibran (temporary headquarters of the Fenice company), with a talented young cast, beautifully conducted by veteran Viotti. Star turns from soprano Massis (exquisite, floating high notes) and Grassi (wonderful, masculine sound in full control). Less successful is tenor Nakajima, whose average instrument is neither strong nor controlled throughout in pitch. Pizzi's production is great, given the tiny stage of the Malaban, and the Fenice orchestra and chorus are superb."
3,Bizet's The Pearl Fishers,"The Pearl Fishers contains some absolutely beautiful music. Of course, the famous duet is amazing, but overall the opera shows that it is one of Bizet's first. In it you can see the genius that is to come! This production is very interesting to sat the least. I still haven't figured out the Orange arced stage floor. But, it works! The two male principles are OK. We've all heard the duet sung better by the ""Great"" stars. Since this is the only full length production with English subtitles, it is worth it."
2,INSIPID,"Poor singing and/or acting by the four principals, particularily the tenor, made this an unattractive acquisition for me. Also the orchestra did not do much in the way of enhancing Bizet's music. The chorus sang adequately. The costumes were good and there was some imaginative use of the camera but this is an opera to be heard. If this was a CD version, it would not rate more than 1 star.Microphones may have been poorly placed or bad sound engineering might also be part of the problem."
4,The Pearl Fisher,"Great production. Thank God it is not modernized, like so many great operas.I can't understand why Traviata, Rigoletto, La Boheme, etc. has to be vandalized by ""modern staging"". They are written in a sertain era for a certain period. It sounds redicilous to hear their liberettos in an ultra modern setting. Besides, can the present generation not learn history?"
1,Poor choice,"This organizer implies that it will keep cool for at least a day. The cool pack included freezes quickly - but only if you have a freezer! There is NO insulation - NONE. I put my Byetta pen in one with a fully frozen pack at 8am. I kept it in the car, under a towel - and the air conditioning was operating. By 1 pm, the pack and pen were at room temperature (at best)."
2,Rough material scratched glucose meter,"Works well, but the inside pocket for a blood glucose meter is so rough that it scratched the LCD lense of my glucode meter."
5,Excellent Quality Cable,It came as advertised. It also works perfectly. It's not a blue cat 5 cable like most of them and could be not so obvious on the floor edge.
1,This is one of the worst book i have ever used for textbook,"I took the electrical engienering course with this book and it was a pain in the ass. first of all the material is very difficult, the professor tries to rush through everything and there is no time for any practice. When i try to do the practice at home, there is NO answer key whatsoever. And the book examples are extremely limited. I also question the author's summarizing skills, mentioned too many redundant formulas and not enough explaination and focus. Overall a very bad book for an already difficult course."
3,"Not too good, Not too bad","This book isn't really as horrible as other reviews indicate. The basic fact is that you gotta have a strong foundation in calculus and basic physics before trying to take on this book. I strongly reccomend these pre-requisites are very crucial in order to understand even little bit of what goes on inside this book. I agree ithe book is very confusing for a beginner or a person who's totally new into circuits but in my opinion the whole thing depends on how strong your background is in calculus and university phsyics. For me the book works, i haven't encountered much difficulty although i did have to struggle sometimes with some chapter problems in the book. Overall, i'd give this book 7 and a half out of 10, on a scale of 0 to 10."
5,Introduction to Electric Circuits,Great circuit analysis book! It is often used for circuit classes in colleges. Definitely recommend it.
2,The most confusing book on circuits i have ever read,This book is not capable of making the reader understand its concepts .No sufficient features favoring the students who are just introduced to the subject.Instead of providing motivation towards the subject the book tends to confuse the reader and thereby promoting hatered towards the subject. Just a waste of time and money.
2,Really just so so,"This book ist not too different in quality from Nilsson, quite normal; some topics are explained okay, others lack a bit of depth in derivation. But the problems are not very fun to solve."
2,Hard to understand,As a textbook this book is quite confusing to me. I don't find it easy to understand. The text is full of formulas and looking at them all makes me feel uncomfortable and I lose interest in continuing. I wish it could be more user friendly. It looks like a book more suited to mathematicians than engineering students.
1,Horrible!!!,"This is the worst book to teach basic foundation skills to future electrical engineers. It assumes that readers are genuises and is definitely not for beginners. It is very difficult to follow and understand. The examples are mediocre and the problems are difficult. It omits key steps in solving some of the problems. It's exponentially frustrating when your university prescribes it as a textbook.(Did the course coordinators even try to read it from a beginner's point of view?) It's only good as a doorstop, paper weight, a projectile to throw at a non-sensical, pretentious PhD student teaching the class(or at least that's what he/she thinks they're doing), or in extreme cases, a toilet paper. Horrible book! Good for bonfires though."
2,VERY difficult to figure out,"Length:: 4:55 MinsI am so glad to see other reviewers had problems figuring out how to change the blades. It has literally taken me 30 minutes to get the blade in, and I really thought I had just somehow gotten a broken one. Now that the blade is in, I don't have any idea how I got it there. Very frustrating as ""using a knife"" didn't bring to mind ideas of spending half an hour getting it ready before I could even start. Come on Stanley, put some directions on this thing. If you've got some time to figure out this Indiana Jones-esque device, go ahead and save a couple dollars. Otherwise, spend a few bucks more and get something easier to use.edit as of 4/4/2011 - I put a video on here because I finally had time to make putting the blade in a project on its own. The quality isn't that great, but it's solid information and gives you a realistic idea of what changing blades is like. Once that blade is in, I have no complaints."
5,It's worth learning how to change a blade!,"I also had the same problems that most people seem to have changing the blades. Frustrating, frustrating, frustrating! Then my husband showed me how to change the blade without taking the tool apart at all (I should have read the instructions???). This is super easy once you catch on, and the knife works great! I use it at work every day for all kinds of jobs, and I wouldn't go back to a different one."
1,Spent 30 minutes trying to put this knife back together.,"Had to take this knife apart just to remove it from packaging cardboard. Once apart, it took me 30 minutes to figure out how to get it back together. Should be some kind of printed instructions. Hope the quick change works so I can make up for my lost time figuring this knife out. Rediculous that there are no instructions."
4,great knife idea,"This is an excellent knife, I have owned more than 20 in my career. (there must be many homeowners who own them now because of my absent mindedness) I would only say there is one knife better than this. It would be the Craftsmen knife of the same design because the Craftsmen is made of aluminum and weighs less and has a sleeker feel. If you can't get to Sears this knife is the next of kin."
2,"I'm sure this is a fine knife, but","I'm sure this is a fine knife, but it's a puzzle. Some instructions would have been nice. I think it takes more than two hands to put it together. It's not my brain--I've solved a Rubik's Cube in less than four minutes, for example. Help!"
3,And here's how to open the spare blade area,"To start, I would like to thank C. Pearson for his video that helped me figure out just now how to change a years-old dull blade (!) and to agree with Robert Chadwick's summary: ""Good Knife --- Frustrating --- Then Simple.""If you cannot figure out how to access the spare blade chamber, as I couldn't, here's how it goes --Press the black button found on the upper surface near the butt (non-blade end) of the knife down and forward until the long black chamber at the bottom of the knife levers open. The first time you may need to press a screwdriver edge into the split between the black area and the silver middle area to pop it open, if the knife is a bit gunky. I'll try to post a picture of the chamber opened to help folks."
2,Nice if you never need to load or change the blade!,"There is NO explanation as how to load / change the blade. It turns a supposed ""quick change"" knife into a 30 minute ordeal. I was so frustrated by the time I finally got this knife loaded, I didn't want to do anything afterwards. There is an EXCELLENT review by a customer (C. Pearson) who had the same problems that I experienced. He went above and beyond and returned to his review and posted a video on how to load / change the blade on this knife. I thought it was just me, but was glad to see that many people had the same problems with this knife. Shame on you, Stanley, for not including simple instructions for this."
5,Good Utility Knife,"I never bought one this utility knifes before, so I didn't know how to put the blade in. But after reading the vague directions. I was able to put it together. Works great if you do a receiving box packages type job."
3,looks nice but...,should have realized this style normally runs small...i am a 5.5 but i think it is like a 4.5-5.0...
5,Best read at night-time....,"This is not a book for everyone....But if you enjoy psychological thrills in your romance and don't mind a hero who may or may not be a cold-blooded killer, then this is the book for you. Richard's cat and mouse games with Cassie will have you all confused and as enthralled with him as Cassie is. The fast-paced plot will keep you turning pages long into the night and the ending is--without giving anything away--fitting."
3,UHHH okay....,"First of all, I am not a lawyer nor judge but I have seen enough Law and Orders to know that there is noway that a CONVICTED murderer would go free on bail while the appeal process was going on. That right there started it off very far fetched for me. I didn't really like the characters at all. The guy was a complete abusive jerk and the girl acted like a lovesick puppy that would take any abuse he gave her with a smile and beg him for more. The sex scenes almost seemed like rape even though she was suppose to be a willing participant. I really had high hopes starting this one cause the story sounded like it could be pretty good but it fell short for me. I have a few other books by this author that I haven't read so hopefully they will turn out better than this one did."
5,This book is the only book I have ever read back-to-back.,"""Follow me"", is not just a book, it is an experience with Jesus. This book will change your life and challenge your walk in the Kingdom of God."
5,Perfect,These inexpensive frames were perfect for family pictures hung on the wall. They enhance my pictures and people can't see the cardboard back
5,"If its good enough for suburban people, it must be good enough for me!","I had been making more enlargments of my photos since 1986. But I could not find an economical way to display them-and I live on a modest budget. I had tried mat boards, cheap wood frames from the discount store. But then my mom who worked for a doctor in the suburbs brought home this discared plastic box frame of his. Apparently they like photography, too. Of course, it was in junked condition. But I figured that if it was good enough the suburbs, it was good enough for me! (Just like Jack Van Impe and the FRANKLIN ELECTRONIC BIBLE!). I had wanted to frame a nice picture that I had enoarged to 16X20. And I called an ecomony frame store in the suburbs. And they wanted at least $70.00 to put my picture in a frame. So, I bought one of these types of frame. I have 11X14 and 8X10 enlaregments of my photographs in these plastic box frames hanging all over the walls of my living room and my study room! This sure worked well for me!"
2,disappointed,"I am disappointed. The top of the flame is above the camera shot. The fire appears to be going very fast and is on a 2 minute loop you see the same flame shot over and over. (if you put it on fast speed you can watch the log jump up and down) When you put on the crackling sound, it pops and crackles so fast, its sounds fake. There is an annoying wind blowing sound along with the cracking. The very Left side of the screen you see the edge of the fireplace, which is annoying because it's only on one side. If these things don't bother or annoy you then buy it. As for me, I will try another one and re-gift this one."
3,"Fireplace could've been better, but loved the aquarium!","I was a bit disappointed with this fireplace DVD. There are black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, even though we have a wide screen tv! Also, the fire itself was somewhat small; I would've liked it to fill up more of the screen on the sides. There was also a glitch in our dvd - when we set it on the crackling fire sound the music pops in after about 5 minutes and plays one song then reverts back to the fire. I do still love the idea of a fireplace dvd, and it did ""warm"" up the room, I just was hoping for something better.The Aquarium DVD however was VERY cool, we really like it! It's very relaxing and realistic looking. We are VERY PLEASED with the Aquarium!!!"
3,Exactly the same as Holiday Fire,I bought this and it is exactly the same as the Holiday Fire DVD. The music and fireplace are the same. There is a lack of options really with just one fireplace and the usual choice of music and/or crackling sound. Good points are that is loops by itself but it does fade to black for a moment. I really didn't like the fireplace view. It's quite distant and it doesn't seem to be in a house but more like a furnace in a basement.
1,Do Not Buy for the Crackling FIre,I recently purchased this DVD as a gift for my father who now lives in a house without a fireplace. He misses the sound of a crackling fire so I thought this would be a great gift! When I got it I wanted to see how is was and at first I really liked it...only thing is about 2 minutes into the crackling fireplace scene Christmas music plays for about 30 seconds. There is an option for Christmas music which is really great however come February that's not really what you want to hear. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD IF YOU WANT THE SOUND OF A CRACKLING FIRE.
2,Only if you want the holiday music,"OK, the Christmas music is good, though it is a stingy serving, only a few songs. The problem is that when you select the flames only option, the holiday music suddenly bursts on in the middle of the silence, as I see several others have noted. If you just want a fireplace video without music this is not the one, the fire only option DOES NOT WORK. Get a different one. In fact, get a different one and play your own holiday music on CD......."
5,Great for relaxation,I think this is the best relaxation video I've seen. The reviewers below are missing the point. There are more exciting videos- of course but that's not the point of this one. If you are looking for a beautiful well-photographed very relaxing movie this is great. I rented it and watched it over and over and now I am buying it.
5,Misunderstood,"In her 1997 essay on the movie, Dr. Mikita Brottman of the University of East London states that, ""Snuff seems an unremarkable, unexiting, second-rate B-movie. Yet, ... Snuff has attracted a notable amount of critical and acedemic attention. Not for the first time, a piece of low-budget, underground exploitation cinema has played a strange and conspicuous role in cinema history."" At the time of its release, Snuff evoked protests outside of theaters, and provoked comment from the likes of George Will and Gloria Steinem. In other words, don't not buy this film because the other guy who posted on here (and managed to get the director and name of the protagonist wrong), instead, buy it for what it is: an important historical document from the annals of American film."
3,Solar Lottery,"I'm no authority on Dick (heh heh), but I suspect this is among his minor works. It's his first novel, and parts of it don't age particularly well. The central concept of a solar system choosing its leaders thru a game of spin the bottle is farfetched even for '50s sci-fi (tho the Electoral College is pretty nutty itself), and it's interesting how many authors of the period envisioned futuristic fashions that entailed women running around topless. But ""Solar Lottery"" does include many of the tropes Dick was known for: telepathy, little guys caught in big conspiracies, the blurry interface of man and machine. And it has nifty neato stuff such as a multiple-personality android with a laserbeam thumb. It's fairly solid, rough-hewn pulp, and I had a good time with it."
3,A Good Warm Up,"One of Phillip K. Dick's lesser read books, Solar Lottery is an interesing genre piece, but not much more than that. The book is full of alegorical/metaphorical content that works fairly well, but this short novel lacks the punch of his later work. For someone just discovering PDK, this book might serve as a good foundation, but compared to Valis this is small time. Still, better than most SF and certainly not a bad read. If you have a spare couple of days it is worth it to pick this book up. Especially engaging is Benteley's quest to find somewhere he can work that is not corrupt and his disappointment to find that neither the public nor private sectors can live up to his idealism."
4,Lean it against the wall?,"Borderless ""frame"", with 6 clips that press the glass against a masonite backing board (pressure holds art in place). Instructions show how to use clips, but nothing else. There doesn't appear to be any means provided to hang on the wall - no mounting holes in board, no frame to attach mounting hardware, and clips can't be used for that purpose (seems they would pop out of place). Trying to figure out how to hang it on the wall!?Update: The clips will stay in place to hang the frame - it didn't sem like they would, and the instructions were unclear. Decent ""frame""."
4,This deodorant worked great. It has a great ...,"This deodorant worked great. It has a great smell (even though it says unscented) but not too overpowering. Its staying power lasted all day. The only drawback for me was the fact that it has propylene glycol as an ingredient. Overall, I give it a thumbs up. I'd recommend giving it a try."
1,This deodorant was so sticky that I could ...,This deodorant was so sticky that I could try it for only one night. My underarms kept sticking together all night. It was very uncomfortable. I felt like it never fully dried. I wouldn't recommend it for that reason.
5,"Fun, educational, fascinating, and did I mention... FUN!!","101 Words You'll Probably Never Need to Know But Can Use to Impress People is a great book to own. Borrowing it from the library or skimming it in the bookstore (you cheapskates!!) is not enough. You must own it to, as my high school English teacher used to say, ""Chew, Digest and Assimilate"" every savory bite!I write and do public speaking, and I can tell you it's LOTS of fun to toss in one of these words without missing a beat, while studying group reactions on the sly!I do love this book!"
5,Imaginative and Fun!,"As a long time subscriber to the author's ""Word of the Day"" website, I looked forward to the publication of this book. I was not disappointed. The book contains the definitions of a diverse array of interesting-although often little used-words, together with very clever illustrations to illuminate each definition. I found the book to be highly imaginative and a fun read. I would recommend it to any reader age 10 and above who is looking for a fun vocabulary building tool."
5,Naughty But Nice,"Kudos once again to that under-appreciated little company out in Ohio who in the summer spin magic in the cornfields for operetta lovers savvy enough to make it out there to see handsomely staged productions of works one never encounters elsewhere in America. And on top of that generosity, they provide periodic recordings of their efforts, mostly done live (which means some audience noises, acoustical compromises here and there--but by and large polished results that are amazing).Naughty Marietta is better known than some of the things OLO does, but has not until now enjoyed a complete digital recording. Albany should be thanked for this series and for this one in particular, as we get ""The Italian Street Song,"" ""Stout-Hearted Men"" and a handful of other classics. The CD sparkles every time soprano Suzanne Woods sings or speaks. She is a real find and had the spicy heroine down to a tee. The stalwart OLO orchestra and J. Lynn Thompson are a big asset. A great buy!!"
2,Bad Engineering,"This album is so ""bright"" that it is nearly unlistenable. They had the material which is quite good and then they engineered the album in such a way that one can only wonder how they had the guts to release it much less charge such a huge amount for it."
3,"Glory to God on high, alleluia.","In the 1990s, an album of Gregorian chants by the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo De Silos calledChantbecame a multi-million selling worldwide hit. That success inspired the release of several ""sequels"", including this Christmas album. The chants on this album were actually recorded several years before the CD came out. The entire album is in Latin. I don't speak Latin, but the CD booklet does include English translations. Several of the chants don't seem to actually be about Christmas, but I'm not sure that makes much difference, since all the chants sound pretty much the same anyway. It is pretty monotonous, but I suppose it would be relaxing to listen to this while you meditated (not that I would ever meditate). New Age music fans will enjoy it more than I did."
5,What a Buy!,"I ordered this CD and what a buy! I love it - very relaxing and inspirational! I play it as I am going to sleep, or just when I need to de-stress during the holidays!"
2,"Great Band, Poor Recording","Sound levels are variable, the mix is nonexistent, and the album deserves a re-mastering. This recording does not transmit the energy and excitement of the Corries as well as some others do."
2,Disappointing Deletions,"I have the vinyl of one of these recordings, and it had about ten more songs on it, many of them ones I really wanted to have on a CD. The sound quality also leaves a lot to be desired - were half the wavelengths ignored?"
5,Turbo Charged Goodness,"I bought this back in the days when I was really into surf music. It was recommended to me by a friend who is really into surf music. Being one of the first albums I bought I really listened to it quite a bit. Glad I did.Great album. Maybe not the first I would buy, such as Dick Dale, but if you are into fueled surf- this is a great buy."
2,Baby Rhymes,"As an elementary school teacher, these rhymes sound like a collection that my students put together. They are cute but lacking in many areas. I still favor the rhymes put out by baby einstein. Those rhymes have more of a beat and a stronger use of interesting vocabulary words."
2,A variation on a theme,"Crazy Cock is Henry Miller's third full length novel and it tells the tale of the triangle between Henry, June and Mara Andrews (aka Jean Kronski). The novel is not very well written, filled with pedantic, prolix and baroque passages, as Miller struggles mightily to find his voice. Miller fans will find this work quite interesting, as it is another variation on The Rosy Crucifixion. However, this book is definately not a good place to start your journey through the works of Henry Miller, as there are many better places to begin (Tropic of Cancer, Air Conditioned Nightmare) your journey."
5,"""The Master"" at work...","Miller is undeniably one of the literary giants. This is a wonderful and enlightening insight into his sourjorn to that height. It's far from perfect, but to any hardcore Miller fan it will be a treat. They will get a real sense of ""the master"" chipping away at the almost singular stone that would forever be his muse."
3,a prelude to the tropics,a prelude to te tropic novels. a journey to the buildup to the better books afterwards
2,Does not fit Thule 690 MOAB,I was hoping to find a product description which listed the width of the hooks. I gambled and purchased anyways. Big mistake! The bars on the Thule MOAB are a much larger diameter so I had to stretch the netting to latch on to other places. The hooks would randomly un-hook at the most inconvenient time during our trip and really became a pain in the butt!! If you are using this with one of Thule's or Yakima's heavy duty style racks look elsewhere.
4,a must for fans,"the first 10 songs show alex at his best.the second cd has poor soundquality,with people shouting and roaring sometimes even louder than alex,but it is great fun."
3,"Not bad, but not great...","I am not a major fan of Mystique videos due to the fact that they spend too much time on non-nude scenes with their models. I took a chance on this one and wasn't disappointed due to the inclusion of one of my favorite models of all time - Crystal Beddows. She is an absolutely gorgeous naturally big-breasted blonde with a face and body that are outstanding. Unfortunately, they don't devote nearly enough time to her. But the DVD is worth buying, even though I rate it as a 3 star."
4,Funny and Romantic,I was pleasantly surprised by this well written romance which takes place during the French revolution. I loved Amy Elizabeth Saunders style of writing.The romance was sensual and believable.
5,brussels is great..,This one is much nicer than the picture. And it practically grows itself. The little pond is a great lil extra.
3,What you see is NOT what you get!,"The quality of this bag is excellent; however, Amazon's PHOTOGRAPH shows a roof-top storage bag attached to the roof rack, while this larger bag was designed to be oriented from side-to-side on a REAR RACK THAT PROJECTS FROM THE TRAILER HITCH.To use it on our roof rack I had to cut a plywood platform for it to sit on, and run additional straps over the top. Since one orients things lengthwise on top of a car, the front end of the bag does not look like the one in the photograph---the front end actually has a wind-catching flap across it! Our 2,800-mile trip included a lot of stops to apply more and more bungie cords (to stop the flapping). At least the dogs enjoyed the many stops. For the trip back we've installed a luggage-securing bungie NET over it. The BAG itself is EXCELLENT!"
2,American Martial Music,"I was not impressed with the quality of the production or the sound of the pieces selected for this collection of so-called military music, and there were what I consider to be important pieces that were not included."
2,Pretty Hokey Stuff,"Ok, I am reasonably patriotic, but some of the stuff on here stretches it a bit! There is a fine line between pride in ones country and over-doing it with praise. I think we have exceeded that point here. Nothing new about these recordings, and they seem pulled from all over. One reviewer is right that these should be public domain. Just go to the army band web sites and download the music directly and bypass Altissimo!"
1,Patriotic Bore!,"This is a mish-mosh of patriotic recordings taken from various sources. Hence the un-even sound quality. Some of this stuff is highlighted on other Altissimo! items already and is just a repeat here. There is nothing really new here, same stuff that is recorded on pretty much every Altissimo! CD."
4,An Irish John Bunyon,"There is nothing as beautiful as an Irish tenor and I'm not even Irish. This is as good as they come. I heard it at a friends and after doing so, I had to have it for my listening pleasure."
1,Terrible audio.,The album I received sounds nothing at all like the sample. The music is so loud you can hardly hear John. It also sounds as though it was recorded in an echo chamber. The record label was Angel Records.
3,I don't get it,"This CD nearly drove me crazy. McDermott has a beautiful voice, but what's with the long, swallowed ""r""'s? The high notes are taken either in falsetto or are troaty and strained. If these kinds of things don't bother you, however, then get this CD. The arrangements are thoughtful and his performances are sincere. Songs-10, voice-3."
3,tracker,"I found this small inexpensive book a worthwile purchase. The drawings for tracks were't very informative, however pictures of the species are excellent. With the brief descriptions of the animals reads more like a pocket field guide than a tracking manual."
1,Negative Outlook,"The book does not have a good flow and is not enjoyable to read to my children. Do not recommend it. For quotes, read other reviews and you'll see what I mean."
1,The Worst Flamenco Ever,"I bought this as a way to practice some of my flamenco work. I should be teaching her. Wow, this was some of the worst technique I have ever seen in flamenco dancer with her waving of the arms, or whatever it was. Hope she dances better than she teaches."
1,Amateurish & Defective,I ordered two DVDs by this dancer. One locked up entirely so that it could not be played. The other played a bit but skipped and froze as well. Very poor quality DVDs and amateurish content. A waste of money!
4,as advertised,"Very nice. Works as advertised - extremely solid, and have had no issues with vibration from my enormous subwoofers since mounting my PJ on this. Only issue is that there's really no room at all to insert the included small screws that are suppose to lock down whatever extension column you screw in. But I've found that if you screw the column in tight enough, there's no way anything short of a direct tornado hit is going to move it anyways."
1,The title is very misleading.,"I was very disappointed with this book. Peterson's has some excellent books on distance education. This is not one of them.Over half of the schools included do not even offer an MBA program. They offer other degrees in management (e.g., M.S.) or similar areas but NOT MBA's.Second problem - most of the schools are not distance at all. Many are restricted to one to five geographic sites around a local area.Third problem - many of the schools only offer a few courses at this point - not full degree programs at all.I was excited about the arrival of this book but... it was a major disappointment. I suggest looking elsewhere. Thorson's Guide has around 30 real distance MBA's (check on Amazon)."
3,not a good fit,"the overall look is OK, but its not too comfortable at the arms. has a kind of wierd fit for the arms. hte length is a lottle longer than it should be, but not bad at all. also the surface is kinda shiny which i dont like at all. i had ordered the aqua color in large, as per the size chart, but I think medium would have been letter. but the arm length is somewhat a little shorter especially when the arms are folded.I paid $39.99 for it, and not too happy with the purchase."
5,review by ALLEN FOSTER from songwriter's monthly .,"January 1998 By ALLEN FOSTER Songwriter's Monthly As the editor of a magazine that has dealt, so intimately, with songwriting for the past six years, I personally wanted to get a look at Paul's [Zollo] latest, expanded edition of Songwriters On Songwriting. I figured I do this stuff seven days a week so I'm going to go over this book and put it under the microscope and really see just how good it is.... Paul also tackles writers such as Carole King, Burt Bacharach, Bob Dylan, Sammy Cahn, Randy Newman, Janis Ian, Rickie Lee Jones, Dan Fogelberg and dozens more. A songwriter simply should not be without this book. The size of this work (658 pages) necessitates that you have your own copy so you can not only read it at your leisure, but you can go back to it -- again and again and again."
3,"This is interesting, but a bit overstated.","I liked Songwriters On Songwriting, but I don't know if you need to read it. From writer to writer to writer the same advice is repeated; writing songs is mysterious, no two people use the same approach, and it's hard work. Beyond that, good luck!"
1,Repetitive .... often dull .,Includes Yoko Ono .Many dull 'rock star' interviews .Almost nothing about songwriting .
4,Not as good as vol 2,"Also bought this CD for dad. He's into doo-wop. After hearing both, we both agree the second volume was better than the first."
2,Save your money for a good pair of shoes,"I bought the video and was disappointed. It is simply not worth the $50 they are asking for it. About half of the video is comprised of repeated clips of Dr. Romanov running. The other half shows drills that one can do to help transform into a Pose runner.I'm a big believer that there is one method that allows for efficient and injury free running and I'm sure Dr. Romanov's clincs are well worth the cost. However, this video falls short of their price tag and should probably be priced around $19.95 range... maybe."
2,Way over priced and will not make much sense if you have not read the book,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. Dr. Romanov is clearly brilliant and his pose method very good way to speed up your pace and reduce injury. However, this DVD was nothing more than video of him doing drills. It does not go into his Pose method and how to do it. I was pretty surprised to tell you the truth. If it were lower price like $19.95 I could see buying it as a reference DVD to see how to correctly do the drills, but $49.95 is highway robbery in my opinion.If you are looking for DVD on how to run injury free and run faster, buy the ChiRunning DVD. It is significantly better and you can actually learn the ChiRunning style/form from that DVD without having to buy the book."
3,Overpriced,"Being about to see how drills are performed is a plus so this DVD is a good companion to the book.However, it is priced unreasonably high for something that is 60 minutes long and looks homemade, with blatant grammatical and spelling errors. Not looking for amazing movie directing, because that's not the point, but it had some avoidable and unnecessary 'WTF' sequences. Also, it didn't come with a drill book.All in all, had it cost around $20 instead of $50, I would've given this five stars."
3,helpful but not that helpful,"I agree with many of the reviews that this DVD is overpriced. It was definitely helpful to see the drills discussed in the book, but not $45 helpful. And because the whole method comes down to ""feel"" rather than ""look"", seeing the drills does not necessarily help you adopt the pose method. Rather, it just gives you a place to start."
2,Pose Method of Running,"I found the video mediocre at best. Much of the video is Dr. Romanov running the same sequence to the same bad music. While I'm sure he's an excellent coach in person, the video did very little to improve my running. In fact, because of using his technique, I'm now suffering plantar faciitis as his method stresses running on the balls of your feet (for distance) which stretchs the ligament.I've looked far and wide for a good instructional running video and unfortunately, this cd is one of the very few in the game. Buy if you'd like, but caveat emptor! Using this technique may cause you injury."
3,"Great at first, but.....","I love racing games, so I got the S.S.C game. At first it was awesome! All the characters said something diferent, and it was fun to race in the different places.But then I had unlocked all the characters and beaten the championship, so there was nothing else to do. Still, you can always do the time trial and find new shortcuts.A great game, but you never get to use the touch screen during races."
5,"Bach: Cantatas, Vol 27 (BWV 80, 5, 115) /Bach Collegium Japan * Suzuki","Bach: Cantatas, Vol 27 (BWV 80, 5, 115) /Bach Collegium Japan * Suzuki is a recording in the series of Bach recordings by Masaaki Suzuki who leads the Bach collegium Japan on this NEC sponsorded recording on BIS Records AB from 2005. The sound quality is crips and it feels as if one is listening to live in person. Klaus Hofmann and Masaaki Suzuki have written the liner-notes and the booklet also contains short biographies of the perfomers, orchestra and the conductor. ""En Feste Burg Ist Unser Gott"" is one of my favorite cantatas by Bach and this rendition is amazing. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."
1,Waste of Money,"A friend gifted me this DVD. With Tai Chi written in 102-point type on the cover and a prominent note saying ""3 hours of self-improvement"" on the back cover, you'd expect a good bit of information on tai chi, especially the movements. All you get is 15 minutes of very elementary stances, done at super high speed, with little or no instruction on breathing. Total waste of money. Do NOT buy this DVD."
5,Loved it!,"Wonderful exercise routine! I even have my 8 and 11 year old children doing it with me also! Its fast so even when I work late, the kids and I are able to get in some kind of physical activity in the winter when the days are short and its sometimes to cold to go outside."
4,quick work out,Great heart pumping workout for when you only have 20min and want to feel you did something. You will sweat for 15 of this 20 min. Shaun T is a great trainer. Audio quality on all beach body workouts needs improving
1,"If you've done Insanity, Don't waste your $$ on this",I've done Insanity. Loved it. Just tried F&F. No comparison. Looks like a much inferior test video Shaun did to prepare for Insanity. You'll get a better workout just doing one of the warmup sessions on any of the Month 2 videos.
1,DO NOT BUY,"This DVD arrived with a sticker on it that said free! What a joke this is, I think this came as a free gift with the Insanity DVD set, and I think this seller is keeping the free gift and selling it to innocent people like me! This is bad business in my opinion, dont give these people any money!"
5,Insanity Workout,"Insanity Workout: Fast and FuriousThe first section of the DVD is geared to get your blood flowing and warm up your muscles. When I went the through program the first time I thought he jumped right into the workout. I didn't realize that the first few minutes is the easiest part.Next Shaun puts you through Dynamic Stretching which I use now every time I need to stretch. Its just a great way to start the real insanity workout.For the main portion of the DVD you will be doing a variety of body weight exercises: jumps coupled with push ups, football runs, the Heisman, and more. Its a grueling workout that will get you sweating fast.Finally he runs you through post-workout stretching. At this point I think one of the actors throws up of camera. Shaun references, ""coughing,"" so I'm not sure if its more than that.The insanity workout is great because you can slow down if needed and push yourself as your stamina increases. I highly recommend it.Jim C[...]"
3,Not for someone that is just getting back into working out!,Goes very fast which is why it has that in the title!Lack of time is my issue and unfortunately I could only keep up for about 12 minutes.
5,Quick exercise dvd,If u need a quick 20 minute work out this is it . It's not fancy but it doesn't have time cause of its length . Very good workout !!!!
2,Not worth $25,This video was ok. Not one of the people in the video could actually keep up - So it seemed like a waste. You basically just jump up and down for 20 min. I can do that on my own.
4,Good workout!,Good workout.. if you work. You have to push yourself at the max the entire time otherwise it doesn't really feel like a workout because it's so short.
4,Fast results,"This is a very fast and effective workout. The moves are fairly easy to pick up but are not easy to do and continue to do. This is a crazy high energy cardio workout. It took me a week to be able to get through the entire 20 minute routine and I've done these type of workouts at my gym and also do Zumba which is pretty high cardio also. After a few days my husband noticed I had muscle definition in my sides already. Awesome! I caution though this workout is not for the faint of heart. I still feel like I want to pass out, throw up, sleep all day the next day, after this one."
1,$20 for commercials!,Total waste of money.Commercials for his products play throughout the video...even in between the workouts. Runs like a 'informercial' on tv so it should be FREE.
2,Looks Cheap,I was expecting a better DVD in a better package. Not what I expected. It looks like a throw a way or free DVD.
4,Workout,Great workout. Not for slow movers!!!! Start out doing five minutes at a time. Condition and add five more minutes after a few work outs.
4,What a WORKOUT!,"Really gets your heart pumping and the sweat running. Once I view the whole CD I'll probably give it 5 stars. Well,worth the money."
4,Phew!,"First of all if you are not fit, do not attempt to do this workout until u are! I wish i knew that before! I am a female and trust me, within the first 2mins of this workout i was busting sweat and gasping for air!!! I was only able to do 5mins of this workout as it was verrrryyy intense and had me far too tired and weak. So i switched to Jilian Michaels. Whenever i am fit enough i will get back to this Fast and Furious. If your fit and bored of your work outs and want something real intense and quick then this is for you!"
2,Shaun T's home video,"Don't get me wrong... I LOVE the Insanity series. Shaun T is the man. However, I am pretty sure he shot this video in his bedroom and made the workout up as he went along. His backup guy, although ripped, seems incredibly out of shape and can barely make it through the 20 minutes. If you buy this, keep your eyes on the female assistant. She actually seems to be trying. If you go all out, it's a good little workout... but don't expect Insanity quality! :)"
1,Save Money and Buy FUll Workout Instead,"Save your money. There is only one workout and a bunch of advertisements on the DVD. I subsequently bought the Insanity full workout because the 20 minute workout was not really useful other then as a demo. Just spend the money for the full workout which is very good. Another note, it helps to have completed p90x before any of the Insanity workouts."
1,Highly Disappointed,I should have read the reviews it's just a bunch of advertisements. It looks like they pieced together this video with edit room scraps. It shows like 30 secs then advertisements and it repeats this cycle. I have little to no budget but I need to lose weight I sacrificed the money and I am highly disappointed of the value I got for my dollar.
4,Tough 20 minutes!,Good for a quick workout. Pretty tough but gets a bit easier each time. It is both a good cardio work out as well as muscle toning and core work out.
5,Great workout,I love this workout because it is only 20 minutes and extremely challenging. I would highly recommend this for those needing an intense workout in a short amount of time.
4,INTENSE...,You will be sweating in the first 2 minutes. Shawn T. takes you to the limit and pushes you beyond. It looks simple enough but watching and doing are COMPLETELY different...try and keep up...LOL
3,Not for me.,Great if you are into fast and intense workout. I lasted only ten mintues. I knew what I was getting into but wanted to try it any way. I gave it to a younger friend who really enjoyed it.
3,Insaine,"Waaaaaayyyy too hard. Unless you're training for some sort of enduring sport...I don't see the point in pushing your body THIS hard. I've used the DVD twice. I love working out, but this DVD keeps me out of breath more than I enjoy...so it will probably sit on my shelf. The idea is good tho!"
1,"It did not work in my DVD player, was never able to use it and not able to return it, very unhappy with this product","I was never able to use this DVD as it did not work in my DVD player and I was not able to return it, a waste of money."
1,Disappointed save your money!,"I purchased this because I liked the other Shaun T workout DVDS and I thought that this 20 minute workout would be great. It starts out with a few warm up exercises and then there are really only about 13 minutes of actual ""workout"" cardio. Yes, they are extremely cardio and not easy as you can see that the people in the video have a hard time keeping up. I just thought it was a waste of money and I wish that I could return it. I recommend that you spend more and get the full workout."
2,SO hard!,This DVD is not for a typical person. Even though some of the reviews say its easy it most definitely isn't!
2,Disappointed,"Based on other reviews, I thought this was going to be a quality video... boy was I wrong! It looks like it was taped spur-of-the-moment in someone's office... ""Hey, I have a great idea... let's make a 20 minute Insanity video!"" ""OK, go over there and I'll grab the next two people I see to be your background dummies and we'll shoot it!"" The sound is horrible and the whole thing is just bad. Not to mention, one of the two background people can't even keep up... he just sits there and watches about half the time! This is definitely a big FAIL, in my opinion."
3,kool,"well i watched it through. now i'm exerciseing with the dvd. i'm really out of shape, so keeping up whit the dvd is hard, but each day i'm better at it. i hope i'll get the results that are advertised.sincerly rp"
5,fast delivery,"delivery was prompt, great work out for those ""lazy days"" or if you are short on time then this is the way to go. Put 110% into it and you get a good work out, but if you are expecting to workout by ""watching"" the video then go back to your treadmill."
4,Product as advertised.,"If you have done Insanity before, I think you will really enjoy the Fast & Furious version. I finished my first round of Insanity around Christmas. I was debating if I should do another round but I found this version and thought it was perfect, given that it's only 20 minutes long. I usually work out in the morning before work, and sometimes I'm running late due to the length of my workout. So I ordered this version and I loved it right from the start. Don't think because it's only 20 minutes you won't sweat, you certainly will! Most - if not all - exercises will be known to you if you have done Shaun T's videos before. You'll do a quick warm up and stretch too.The only reason I gave it a 4 start rating instead of 5 was that when I opened the package and saw the thin sleeve I was disappointed. Honestly, $25 for one single 20-min workout is a bit pricey, but at least I thought the case was going to look a bit nicer. It's really not a case, just a cardboard sleeve."
4,A good intro to Insanity,"I had been debating purchasing the complete Insanity set but before shelling out the $$$$, I decided instead to get this DVD first. I've been seriously exercising for more than 3 years now and have progressed enough to feel I needed a real challenge to maintain my level. This is a good choice for time-crunched days, or if you're feeling really hardcore, to combine it with another routine like weights or for before or after a short-distance run. The disclaimer at the beginning is accurate: DO NOT ATTEMPT this if you are a novice. Some of these moves are hard on the back/knees and I had to substitute a couple of them. I'm not sure I'm ready for Insanity but I'm glad I got this."
4,Great 20 minute work out!,This DVD was exactly what I expected from Sean T & Insanity. An intense 20 minute workout that fits in nicely with my P90X regimine. Keep in mind that you have to work out within your means and build your endurance over time. Stick with it! A good buy!
2,A little too fast,I recently completed the P90x and Brazil Butt Lift programs and was looking for something with a little more cardio. Since I have knee issues I decided to try this first instead of purchase the complete program. I'm so glad I did because I was really disappointed. The workout I think would be amazing if it were just a little slower or he went over the moves slowly once before picking up the pace. I had such a difficult time keeping up which made me frustrated and feeling like I wasn't getting the full benefits of the workout. After about ten minutes I stopped the DVD and put in something else.
5,LOVE!!!,"This is a very tough workout it a small amount of time! If you aren't ready to invest in all the Insanity videos this is a great starting point. Or, it is a great add on when you are ready. This workout system is AMAZING!"
5,Perfect for THOSE days,"This is the perfect addition to the full INSANITY workout. Those days when I am too sore, I mean busy, to do the recommended workout, I can pop this in an get a ""45 minute INSANITY workout packed into 20 minutes""."
4,Good product!,"I was afraid that this workout would be way too much for me to do since I'm still recovering from a severe ankle break (after 18 months), and I'm really out of shape and a large girl. But I've been doing the program for about 2 weeks and I just modify everything I can't do. For instance, when he's doing the power jumps, I just do knee lifts as high as I can. When he does the jumping jacks, I do single jacks. I may not be anywhere near being able to do all the stuff on this DVD but at least I'm finally back to a regular routine. I definitely recommend it. Don't let it intimidate you! Let it be something to work towards. I look forward to the day when I can do some of those harder routines!"
3,Not for the out of shape,"My husband and I have tried this once since we bought it. I wish we could do it more often, but it is quite difficult. We are both in our 30's, we're pretty active (zumba and long walk/runs daily) and about 15 lbs overweight and we were wiped within 5 minutes. Also, I think I may have torn something in my back doing this - my advice - BE CAREFUL until you are in better shape. The trainer does keep you motivated, but they go from standing to push ups by basically falling down and I think that's what might have wrenched my back. A good workout, but just take your time until you're more used to the workout."
3,Can't believe Shaun T would release this?????,"I love INSANITY...I love Shaun T....but what is this??? I need a quick 20 minute workout and this work out is a killer, don't get me wrong. BUT the audio is horrible, the camera men are in the way and in shots. It looks like it was filmed in Shaun T's appartment. The 2 others in the video have no room to work out. It seems like this video was just thrown together and what the heck, its good enough, lets release it. The crazy INSANITY people will buy it. I'm one of those crazies, I guess. Way over priced and a poor quality product from Shaun T. I'm surprised Beachbody would put their stamp of approval on this."
3,insane.,"It seems to be little difficult, but doable. I tried it and it was okay. I guess it is mostly for intermediate to advanced level. Beginners may have a difficult time. You should try it even if you end up doing 2 or 5 minutes of it."
3,OK,Gets you heart pumping for sure. A lot of Jumping in this work out. Feels repetitive since there is only one workout included.
4,no joke,Great workout! it is not for beginners thats for sure. if you start be prepared to sweat and be sore the following day.
5,Its crazy!,"I was not able to finish the warm up. Yes I know I'm in bad shape, but this made me feel worse. At least I can finish the video now. I totally recommend this for a good workout. Its not the best for an apartment as you can get complaints from the neighbor below, but its definitely worth it."
4,Great workout!,This was a great workout vid. I only wish they had more than one routine. After a while you already know what he's going to do next...
3,Its ok really hard work out,its ok really hard work out its no joke really got to in the mood or you will get tired really quickly
4,Insanity,The dvd is great. Its more than worth the price for the intense quick workout that you recieve. Great motivation to get in shape.
3,20 mins of cardio,"Just purchased this two minute Beach Body video. I have back problems so I always avoiding things like Insanity & P90x in fear of that. However, after using Jillian Michael's 20 min shred with good results, I figured I would give this one a try too. This video is straight cardio, with a few jump movies and a little bit of core training. While I am glad I tried it out, it is NOT something I would purchase again, or recommend to a friend. If you are curious and have some extra cash, try it out.. but there are other 20 min workouts that are much better and much cheaper."
1,Plant died several days after delivery,"Packaged nicely, but plant died several days after delivery. Very disappointed. As this was a gift. Recipient followed misting/ water instructions. Leaves turned black (possible mold) and fell off. Gift was to 86 year old aunt in another city and unfortunately returning the bonsai plant not feasible."
2,Three strikes and your out,"I received my Bonsai today, this is the third try with attempting to get a decent product from this company. The first tree sent was bare, and the base was shattered, the second came and it appeared to be frozen (ok - it is winter, but you would think that either they would take measures or at least warn). The third one came today - same shape, beautifully sculpted tree, but the leaves are frozen, like it has been left in a frigid warehouse or something. My recommendation? stay away at least until they can figure out how to ship these and still make them live....."
1,Covered in Aphids,Tree arrived quicker than expected. Packaging was awesome. Tree looked very good. But it quickly started dropping leaves. Looked close and noticed that it is literally covered in aphids. None of my other plants have aphids. They might now.
3,"Beautiful plant, arrived infested with aphids","I received this bonsai as a gift from my husband this spring. The tree was packed well, but many of the leaves were covered in a black mold. I rinsed the plant and it was fine for a couple of days. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it lost many of the leaves. A few days later I discovered that it as infested with aphids. I rinse the plant regularly, and it is still quite healthy, however, I can't seem to get rid of the aphids.The tree is beautiful, but I would not recommend this to anyone who wants to avoid a high maintenance plant that threatens your other houseplants with an aphid infestation."
1,nice tree with issues,"Just like the rest of the comments yes the leaves do fall off after a few weeks of receiving it. However, mine came with nats/little flies that have been all over any lighting source in the room."
2,Came with Snails!!,"The tree was packed well with another tree and they both arrived in okay shape. The Fukien looked great for a short while until I accidentally bumped the table it was sitting on. It abruptly dropped piles of leaves and now looks horrible. While I was cleaning up I noticed there were small snail shaped creatures attached to the bottoms of some of the leaves. Very disappointed, won't order again and won't recommend."
3,Only Had Problems,"Well I got this tree a few weeks ago and the leaves started to turn yellow as is normal. The tree has only been kept inside with NO other plants and under a full spectrum light. It now has aphids and a fungus and unfortunately isn't looking too well.Update: The plant is still alive a few months later. It was a constant battle with the aphids until I finally put the bonsai tree outdoors and a swarm of lady bugs devoured all of them haha. The one issue I'm still having is that I can not get this thing to produce the berries its supposed to. About a dozen or so flower will bud and then die after blooming.As a tip to other buyers, remove the moss on top of the soil IMMEDIATELY and water it every day. The soil should be damp all the time. If your leaves are drooping or turning yellow, it needs more water."
2,Instant Fall,Two days after this plant arrived - ALL it's leaves fell off like the first cold snap of an Eastern Fall - I'm trying to get it to come back to life.... no success as yet - perhaps this plant is too fragile to be shipped.
2,Sick,"This tree arrived sick and infested. Shop with caution, It has a great curved trunk and looked awesome until I started to realize the black things on top of and under the leafs are not normal and turned out to be aphids. I am doing everything in my power to get this tree back to health but its been about a week and a half without out much improvement. Disappointed to say the least."
1,black mold,Came covered in black mold. The plant never recovered even though it was treated right. Waste time and money. Should have known better than to purchase plants of the internet. (was also purchased for mothers day)
1,Mother's Day gift dead by Father's Day,"Save your money or spend a few dollars more & visit a local nursery or at least shop around more & read customer reviews. I bought this as a gift for Mother's Day. It arrived in a timely manner & in good condition or what appeared to be healthy to a layman. She followed guidelines for watering, light, etc. But as the few short weeks wore on, the leaves fell off & the plant was dead by Father's Day (a month later). Unable to return or get refund/credit because the recipient lives quite a distance away. She didn't inform me of the plant's passing until after the time period for returns has just expired. I should have read the customer reviews first - lesson learned... the hard way!"
1,Maybe in the Spring?,"The first tree looked good, but arrived with a broken pot. I returned it without problem for a replacement.The leaves of the second tree were dark and drooping. The soil was very wet. The leaves quickly began to dry and fall from the tree. I suspect there was some cold damage during shipment (6 days by UPS) or the soil was just too wet. Since I've read that the Fukien Tea may loose it's leaves, I've kept the soil moist and have been waiting for it to releaf. The small branches have become brittle, so there's not much hope. The return window is open for another two weeks. Should the tree perk up by then, I'll provide an update.It would have been a nice looking tee. I don't recommend ordering in winter."
1,Nice plant.......for now...(not any more...),"I recieved this little tree in the mail with quite a few brown and dying leaves. The flowers soon died off as well. The tree does have good form though, so we'll have to see if it actually survives.It's dead now!!! It looks like it didn't make it... I returned it to Amazon and they gave me a refund. Soil did not allow water to enter even after a complete soaking. So I packed the twig back into the box and the UPS guy came and took it away for free. Now I have to clean the hundreds of dead leaves off of my floor."
1,Commercial exploitation of a real master,"Lester Levenson's life and teaching were truly inspirational, but when is Larry Crane going to stop using Lester's name to advertize his own business. Lester died in 1994, and this book consists of nothing but a few pages of Lester's words transcribed from an old recording. The rest is meaningless padding and repetition."
5,A Masterpiece,This book teaches you anova in plain English very clearly and enters the math symbols little by little after teaching the concepts. I highly recommend this to people who are to start their research and need statistical methods (especially if you do not have strong math background) and it is best used before working with statistical softwear packages.
1,short lived,"I didn't have a problem with this camera, that is until one day when it was only two and a half years old it suddenly stopped working. I never missed treated it in any way. It just stopped working. Tried a new battery and a new charger - still didn't work so I sent it off to get it repaired and they said you might as well buy a new one. Now I am waiting to try and get a bit of compensation from samsung to go towards a new one - but not a Samsung of course."
5,Samsung GX-10 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera,It's awesome and I can't wait to explore all of it's capabilities. Thank you for your prompt response and help.
2,No follow up,"First of all. People buying DSLR cameras expect to be a Photographer or take Great Pictures.If you want to be a Photographer it will be way expensive since all Samsung/Pentax lenses are expensive and rare.For example. A Canon 50mm 1.8 is US90, and Pentax 1.7 is like US200.If you want to borrow a lens from Anyone. Will be impossible since I've never seen anyone using Pentax, or less Samsung.Thats why most new to dslr companies fail. The legacy is Important.Nikon and Canon have an old Legacy of Old lenses Compatible with new Bodies.SAMSUNG NOR PENTAX Makes Professional Lenses or Cameras(NO Full frame cameras) means that if you buy lens from them you wont be able to use it in Full frame cameras.Canon/Nikon is the way to go."
2,"I am a flaming liberal, yet I didn't like this book......","I am as left-wing as they come and loathe Bush with every fiber of my being, yet I could not get into this book. I admit it: I stopped after 60 pages. The tone, I'm afraid, is quite naive and it sounds like the prose of an earnest 17 year old hoping to, like, change the world, man. I have heard these things hundreds of times before, yet the author would have us think that this is groundbreaking. But I also rolled my eyes when he started talking about spirituality and being a ""true"" Christian. The only hope the left has is to throw out religion, not embrace it. I don't need Lieberman-like candidates when there is already the GOP. In all, I was bored with this book. It lacks the crucial element of a sense of humor, which makes it a bit embarrassing at times. There are better books out there for liberals; seek them out."
1,"Angry yes, pointless yes","Democracy is dead according to Will Pitt and other far left 'thinkers', but save yourself the money and just go spend time at democraticunderground.com or truthout.com and get the same hateful negativity for free."
1,Propoganda Pamphlet,"I read ,oh maybe 3-4 pages of Mr.Pitts new epic masterpiece and I agree with the reviewer from Boston...This book is pure crap!Mr.Pitt ignores fact and just makes up his anti-bush rhetoric as fits him.Just another angry liberal folks..nothing to see here.Environmentalists should be fuming mad that trees had to die to make this propoganda pamplet."
1,don't bother,The anti-American left may get a kick out of this--certainly an ego trip for socialists.
4,Fun - but no countries,"My kids have reached the placemat age. They love poring over their placemats at meal time. They also love our globe, so I thought this mat would be a good addition to our table. It is brightly colored and fun to look at, and there are fun illustrations and factoids - but my biggest complaint is that there are no country boundaries and the map is just not realistic.Later, I picked up two huge laminated wall maps - one of the world and one of the U.S., and put them up on the wall, so we use those maps, and our globe, when we want to find countries."
2,Doesn't stay in place and designs scratch off quickly,"Within 1 week some of the designs began scratching off around the edges. This is probably meant for kids older than 3 who have better table manners. It's not terribly accurate either, so it really isn't suitable for an older child. I'm going to guess it's best for the 3-5 age range (not my 18 month old when I wanted a distraction for him in restaurants). I do still take it with us on the go so I know we have a clean surface - it rolls up okay."
3,Don't get your hopes up.,"I only give this ""three"" instead of ""two"" because I respect Benny Benassi, but this ""mix"" is really a placid compilation of tracks that might sound better when mixed live, and with thousands of other people. There is no sense of flow or buildup throughout (except at then end, when it isn't worth it); there is only an unpredictable change of tempo.The disc's only salvation is the tracks themselves, which are most often excellent when taken alone or put in a separate playlist. ""Put Your Hands Up for Detroit"" is of course excellent, as well as ""Love Is Gonna Save Us"" and ""Dance is ""Dead"". But these aren't enough to save a mostly boring compilation.I would suggest looking for the tracks you like instead. Putting them all together for close to $20 is definitely not worth it."
2,***********A Bit Uncomfortable**********,"Someone showed me these shoes on Amazon and I feel instantly in love with them. These wedges were quite different with the multi-coloured criss-cross design at the back. However in reality they are not the most comfortable shoes you will wear!The material is quite hard and the back constantly rubs your feet. My feet aren't very broad at the toes but because the material is so hard it also makes the toe area uncomfortable as well. Buyer beware...if you think beauty is pain, then maybe these shoes are for you! I have yet to wear them a second time to see what happens...."
2,Not so comfortable,"I received this item earlier than it was due. These are not as shiny as they may seem. I have a wider foot than most people and these shoes are quite narrow. Also, they feel very cheap, rubbed blisters on my heels and are very tight on your toes. I would not recommend these to anyone. While they look absolutley adorable sitting in your closet, they don't feel so adorable."
4,It's GOOD music,"Pick this CD up, it's not a shallow recording like many other new ska bands. The lyrics are thoughtful and sometimes on the emotional edge. Though they are not new to the scene, they are certainly doing a great job, considering they were ex-members of Mealticket. If you can, catch them live, they are fantastic."
5,creative and fun,These tails were a big hit for my grandson at Christmas. They were very well made and he enjoyed pretending. I am now looking for noses to buy so we can complete the outfit!!
5,All White is All Right,"The Epiphone Les Paul Custom is one of the most amazing guitars I have ever seen. This Les Paul integrates the sound of Gibson with the affordability of Epiphone. I bought my Epiphone Les Paul Custom used, but it still had a clear, beautiful sound. I highly recommend this guitar for guitar players of any genre. You won't be disappointed!"
2,"Not that essential, same old Public Domain stuff!","There is nothing ""Essential"" here, it is the same old Public Domain films that we has seen many times before. Stick with the MPI resorations.For those who want to know, this set includes the same old titles:TERROR BY NIGHTSHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPONA STUDY IN SCARLETTTHE REAL SHERLOCK HOLMES (a documentary made up of PD clips)."
2,product released with obvious defect,just purchased from home depot. Discovered toilet rocked back and forth on flat serface. Noticed two tabs protruding from bottom of toilet. Kohler explained they were from manufacturing proccess. Tried sanding with random orbit-- forget-it. Kohler asked if I had a grinder. How can they let products leave with defects. returned to home depot. Good luck Kohler.
4,Beloved Hymns,"I already knew what the c.d. was like, I am justglad that I could find it since the reproduction ofit had been discontinued."
5,Better Than Expected,Beautiful piano lamps are expensive so when I came across this one I didn't expect much for the price that I paid. But I was definitely impressed when I received the lamp. It was well worth it!
5,piano lamp,"I purchased this item to replace a brass lamp of the same style which I got tired of polishing, so this is exactly what I wanted."
5,Great!,I love using this product! They are heavy duty and never disappoint. The five pack makes it super convenient when the blades become dull.
5,A must have,"Anyone that uses real mathematics should have this book. It isn't a textbook, don't expect it to teach you anything. It's a reference. More math than most people will ever learn is tightly summarized and nicely organized in the first 60 pages."
3,A Solid Handbook ...But Still Not as Good as CRC Math Tables -Handbook,"I ordered this book because I wanted an additional handbook for my home office downstairs. This Fifth edition is superior to the 3rd, which I had from my years at Loyola University (1960s), but still not as complete or enriched as the CRC Math Tables-Handbook (just about any edition). Still, I am using it for areas that are easier to access and apply such as the analytic Geometry section (pp. 46-47) and use of differential calculus formulae (pp. 49-52).The Table of Integrals, p. 71, is also very convenient to apply."
4,An improvement over conventional hand saws.,I have a few of these around. They represent a much needed update to the original cordless saws. They realy cut fast for a hand saw. That tooth design is superior. BUT I like the Japanese pulls saws even better. They have a very similar tooth design but it's reversed so they cut on the pull stroke. This enables them to have a thinner blade so you expend less energy for the same amount of work. They cut even faster than the stanley's. Check the saws from shark corp. I beleive you will find them to be superior for a very reasonable price. You can spend hundreds of dollars on a hand made Japanese saw but you don't need to.
3,good for occasional traveler,"We mounted this on our Sienna and traveled 900 miles to New Mexico. It was able to withstand both rain and hail because everything stayed dry. The two main complaints about this product is that it is not truly aerodynamic and the zipper is not smooth. At 80 MPH, the wind compressed the front of the carrier making it look like a rectangular box. The zipper works but it was very hard to negotiate around the corners. One last thing I have to mention is that it was hard to open to put our items in it. You have to use one hand to hold the top piece back while using the other hand to load your items. The alternative would be to get help from another person. It also comes with two long straps with buckles that was easy to mount. Overall, this product is good for one to two road trips per year."
4,Shadows On A Mirror... A Soul To Keep,"The interesting ideas in the story might have been better explored by a first person narrative. I found in the book a mix of some very fine writing and short-cut characterizations. The dialogue between characters was generally wasted trying to carry metaphysical questions which a narrator might share with a reader more easily. It is a book worth reading, however, for many reasons, including a teeth rattling car chase on The Beltway."
2,Required reading,"Dull reading is not helped by repetitive statements in this management textbook. Stueart and Moran add to textbooks' reputation for dullness and difficult reading. The authors give long definitions for terms that must already be understood by a large portion of the population, but use specialized terms long before an explanation is given in the text. One can only hope that there are better management textbooks and that most professors choose those."
1,Zero Stars,"Obviously we're all LIS students responding to this travesty of a ""text"" because no one in their right mind would sit down & read this thing unless it were required to do so. Shame on Stueart/Moran and the publisher Libraries Unlimited for producing this at the ridiculous price of $50. I plan to pass this book along to a LIS classmate free of charge next semester so he doesn't have to pay for it, and so that Stuart/Moran get no more royalties out of this joke of a book. I recommend everyone to do the same; yes, you've lost money, but if everyone refuses to buy it, perhaps Libraries Unlimited will get the message & drop it. I'd give it zero stars if Amazon would let me; one star is actually too much. Do yourself a favor and find other management texts that cover the same topics: I guarantee you'll get much more out of them than you will this ""text""."
1,there must be a better way,my other management textbooks were able to cover nearly the same amount of information in 1/4 the space without being needlessly complex or as paralizingly boring. it would be an excellent cure for insomnia. professors PLEASE don't make anyone buy this thing.
1,A very disappointing book,"Well, I had problems with both the content and the style of this book. The content is just, well, banal. So much of what is said seems trite. As for the style, I found it bland, arid, and jargony. There isn't a witty or well-crafted sentence in the book. Ideas are seldom stated plainly. Pleonasms abound. Take this sentence: ""the more successful the performance in relation to the goals, the greater the degree of satisfaction experienced"". The phrase ""in relation to the goals"" adds nothing. Nor do ""degree"" or ""experienced"". Why not just say, ""the more successful the performance, the greater the satisfaction""? Perhaps that just doesn't sound clever enough.Anyway, this book could have been written in half as many pages. Think of the waste of trees and ink, not to mention the time of the poor students who have to read it for class.One out of five."
3,Riddled with errors.,"The overall scope of the book is perfect for a two quarter data structures class. It goes into just enough depth to teach you something new, and something useful. But if you actually try to follow code examples or try to understand a diagram, beware because there are a lot of errors in them. Every chapter has at least two errors. Problem is, we are supposed to be learning something new and if the diagrams can't explain the situation correctly how can we not help but be confused. Don't buy this book unless you have to have it for a class, there are better books."
4,Its not exactly clear,"I bought this case for a different reason than most. It was for an engineering project where this item would be underwater with electronics in it including a webcam looking out. The only problem, is that this isn't really clear, its frosted, so a webcam will not see through it clearly. For most of you shoppers, this will be fine, but if you are looking for something truly clear, this isn't the product."
5,A hypnotizing blend of melodies with beautiful vocals,"Kendall Meade, formerly of the band ""Juicy"", has created a beautiful compilation of songs that draw-in the listener. If you have never heard this singer, you'll be rewarded with a great find!"
1,Not as pictured!,"The scene shown on the box is *not* the scene on the DVD. The actual scene (although it is in HD) is much less colorful. It also seems like the video is on a fairly short loop because you see the same fish doing the same thing over and over again. The music is so-so, there are much better ambient CDs if that is what you are looking for."
1,Only 1 freshwater scene,"Caution on this one, just got it in the mail and it has only one aquarium scene a freshwater scene. NOT a saltwater one as pictured on the box, and even the freshwater scene is not that great anyways. If your into suthing music buy it for that. 8 different tracks for one lousy scene and the pic is not to great either. There are other DVD's out there for a better price and content."
5,The BEST Discworld novel of all!,"To my mind this is the best of all the Discworld novels, most of which I really love. It is both funny and poignant, and I love the characterisation, especially Carrot, who seems completely unaware of him impact on people and his possible ancestry. I also like Commander Vimes' anti-hero type character. If you read only one Discworld novel, make it this one."
3,Guards! Take this book to the back of the line!,"The first book in the ""Guards"" series is clearly one of Pratchett's earlier works. His writing hasn't achieved the polish that wins him fans and praise from every corner yet, leaving the reader unsure if they would like to try another book by him. If you haven't already met Vimes, Carrot, the dwarves, trolls, and werewolf of the Watch you might want to read the next book in the series first, then come back to this one. You will have missed the meeting of Vimes to his wife, and her habit of keeping odd dragons, but other than that you won't have lost much. This book feels as though it doesn't know what it wants to be yet, or who the character's really are. Later in the series the Guards books become more mystery-esque, here it's straight adventure, and the character's personalities aren't clearly set out yet."
4,"Funny, funny man.","I don't like to do things easy. I picked up this book in an airport on a business trip. I had never read Terry Pratchett before, but had heard him mentioned by some people that I work with. All I can say is that they are correct! The book was filled with vivid characters that made me laugh. It included a dragon that wasn't quite right, and alcoholic and some bad guys. Seems simple doesn't it? Well this author has created a world with it's own rules. All of the above characters are woven into a tapestry that takes a comical look at a society of laws. There is a message in there somewhere and when I finish wiping the tears of laughter from my eyes I'll figure it out. It is now my understanding that there are 20 something Discworld books and I will have to find them all now. Guess my business trips will be covered for the foreseeable future."
3,"Good, but not great Discworld story.","I have been making my way through the Discworld series, and I have really enjoyed it. I thought this book was the weakest of the series. I started and stopped reading this one several times before reading all the way through this time. By no means is this book bad. This book is witty, amusing, and sometimes laugh-out-loud-funny, but it is not as funny as the other Discworld novels.Guards Guards introduces several new characters: the men of the Night Watch, including their dispirited captain, Vimes; Lady Ramkin, a mountain of a woman who raises swamp dragons and has designs on the captain; and Carrot, a giant young man who was raised by dwarves. A few familiar characters also make an appearance, such as the librarian of Unseen University, who is an orangutan.An enjoyable story, but I cannot rate it any more highly in comparison with the other superb Discworld novels."
5,"Great read, a must read",The satire and humour in this book blend perfectly into a must read novel. I think everyone should read this book.
4,You don't need to be on your guard for this book!,"Terry Pratchett continues with his witty and entertaining Discworld series, where the planetary disc rides on the backs of four elephants standing on a turtle traveling through space.After that, you should expect anything!This is my second Discworld book, following Mort. I don't know whether Mort was written before or after Guards! Guards! And it didn't matter! I can see Pratchett's style... a lot of new characters and hints at old characters and events.In Guards! Guards!, Carrot finds out he isn't really a dwarf, and is sent off to the big city for fame, fortune, and a non-dwarf mate. He takes life and his job a little more seriously than his peers, and when an ""extinct"" dragon appears, he is the man on the spot.Young Adult literature, for the young at heart."
3,only fair,"I do not know Pratchett well at all; I have read about four or five of his books. This is the least pleasing. A little kooky, but not as creatively kooky as he can be."
5,Hilarious and exciting,"I read this on the train and it made the trip very enjoyable, thank you Terry Pratchett! It has all his classic and quirky trademarks and had me chuckling a little too enthusiastically for some of the other passengers, but I couldn't care less, great book!"
2,Great book; Poor Kindle Formatting,"I love this book, an introduction to the indefatigable Sam Vimes and his motley watch.However, the formatting for my Kindle was very poor. There was a blank line between every paragraph, which, to a reader, normally indicates a passage of time. It was difficult to get into the flow of the narrative with that.The font for Death was too small to read as well."
5,Works exactly like you'd expect,I picked this up to be an extra water dish for my Amazon because he likes to attempt baths in his other dish. This dish works just fine. I've never had any problem with the clamp slipping down the bars of the cage. The bird hasn't managed to destroy any part of it yet and the cup (after nearly a year) still looks as good as new.
2,Not a quality product - coop cup,"Really slow shipping, arrived past ship date, only three out of the eight bowls had bowl holders that could be used. There was a sharp ridge that wasn't removed during production which was on the inside of the square plate-dangerous for bird toes. Metal on bowls is thin."
3,Not 10oz Cup,"Shipped really fast. The cup holder is not quite as good as others I bought for about the same price. The cup volume is 8 oz, not 10 oz as list or as stated on the packaging."
1,Defective,We ordered 20 of these for our kennel - five of them (25%) were defective to the degree that they were not usable. We won't consider these again
3,Good price but bad fit,"Nice dishes, however they don't fit well in the prefab holders on my parrot play stand--I had to hot-glue wooden wedges behind them so they would not fall out easily."
2,larger size doesn't have enough support,"I purchased 2 of the 30 oz cups for my dog's crate. Each holder only has 1 bolt and wing nut, which I should have realized in advance would not support the larger sized cups. Between the weight of the food/water and the pressure my dog would put on the cups while eating/drinking, they didn't last 2 hours in the crate with my dog. One of the wing nuts was stripped when it arrived, so did not hold up at all. The other one I put in my bird's cage as a bird bath. I gave this product 2 stars because the description is not misleading, but one of the two I purchased was pretty much worthless. Instead, I purchased 2 of theMidwest Stainless Steel Snap'y Fit Water and Feed Bowl, 2 Quartand they work great. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Fun and Relatively Quick Growing/Learning Experience,My 6 year old had a lot of fun watering this and checking for sprouts every day. It was a good chance to teach him that plants need water and light.
3,Not bad for a first Novel,"I read this book about 5 years ago and found it very good for a first attempt at writing a book. By reading this, it is easy to see that Peter Straub has huge command of writing and language.Although Peter wanted to be a mainstream novelist at the beginning, I am very glad he found writing darker fiction more to his liking. After you read this book, check out Mystery, The Throat and The Hellfire Club."
2,Hmm,"I have all of Straub's horror writings, and so was looking to complete my collection of him with this first novel. Straub calls it a ""not so good"" novel on his website, and he's right. The characters seem like paperdolls, like symbols of something I wasn't smart enough to figure out. The type of visual imagery used to express emotion just doesn't come off here, like it does in the horror books.Still, I am glad to have the book, yellowed and old as it is."
1,Forget it!,"Check my review at UNDER VENUS by the same author. This is also a terrible early work by one of the most gifted authors of today. I still think, no, hope, that this book was written by someone only using the name Peter Straub as a pseudonym."
3,Inaccurate description of book,"The delivery of the book was quite prompt. The book had multiple highlights and writing throughout. It was listed in good condition, but I was not impressed with the condition. I was unable to put my own markings in the book, because there was so much writing and highlighting in it."
3,A bit of history mixed with important techniques,"The methodologies presented in the first six chapters are each a compendium of obsolete second language teaching techniques. The information is interesting but not valuable. In its later chapters, this book successfully describes common methods used in today's classroom. It is a fairly good reference book for beginning ESL teachers to have."
4,Introduction and Overview,"Strictly an overview, and a good concise introduction to the major techniques for introducing English as an L2 to ELL's.Typically one good example of a class session for each topic, then a side-by-side summary of characteristics and applicable principals.If you are learning about different methods, or trying to decide which might best fit your style, this is an excellent place to start. If you are looking for in-depth training and applications, more specifically-oriented material would be better."
4,Pretty good book,The book is great and the techniques are easy to understand. Great for the class of methodology in language teaching.
5,Another great Brother Cadfael story,This book is as good as all the Brother Cadfael stories. It is unfortunate that they are not available on Kindle.
2,(sigh),"The product was acceptable, I was disappointed with the quality. I am only guess it was at the lower end of the scale for the rating, and I was used to it being mid to higher end.This is not a criticism, just an emotional response."
2,"MAKES A JOKE OF ALCOHOL/DRUG ABUSE, BOOK SHOWS IT","THIS BOOK IS JUST THE RAMBLINGS OF AN AUTHOR WHO SPENDS MOST OF THE TIME IMPAIRED, AND IS PROUD OF IT. YOU FEEL AS IF YOU WERE IN A BAR STUCK NEXT TO A DRUNK MUMBLING NON STOP WHILE YOU LOOK FOR A SPOT ANYWHERE ELSE TO WAIT FOR YOUR DINNER TABLE."
1,I would not purchase from this bookseller.,"I was very disappointed when I received my shipment from this bookseller. It took over two weeks to arrive, and was shipped in a cheap, cardboard envelope with no padding. On the outside, the cover was well-worn, with tears on the edges, and the page edges were marked on the top and bottom with a blue ""palm tree."" The first inside pages were torn, and the cover page had another blue palm tree! The rest of the inside pages were in fair condition, with a brown stain on some of the edges. I paid $30.00 for this book, and it was definitely overpriced. Most booksellers include contact information with their shipment, some even have a comment sheet. This shipment only contained one very beat-up book so that motivated me to write this review."
4,"""Politics spoken a la play-by-play sports announcer w/ flair","What more could you want? Drugs, politics, conspiracy. Thompson writes with his familiar exaggerated non-fiction style which marks the true insanity of gonzo journalism. He captures the pulse of the nation during its turbulent time. He draws the lines of the factions of not just political parties, but social causes as well."
5,Fear & Loathing in paperback,"Hunter Thompson writes how Mark Twain would be writing had he seen the sixties. His irreverent wit and sharply strong feelings toward his subjects make this a fascinating look at the 72 election. He writes as an unwelcome outsider. The campaign trail is no place for the Wild Turkey guzzling ""Rolling Stone"" correspondent, and so his unique point of view on the whole awful matter is quite refreshing (in a rather cynical way). He really was one of the best American writers and journalists. For those who are only familiar with ""Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas"" be sure to check out the rest of the man's works."
3,lot to like,Boy is there a lot to like about this book. I am not a big fan of Thompson. But he really shows his stuff here. Some of the chapters are very good.
5,best book on any campaign ever,"being a 17 year old guy, i am not that interested in polititcs, but this book somehow interested me like crazy. it was the most interesting and informative book ive ever read"
5,loved,quick and fantastic. amazing book and got to me so very quickly! my husband is also a giant fan of it
4,Fear and loathing of Humphrey and Nixon,"A great behind the scenes view of journalists covering presidential elections- from the New Hampshire primary circut of handsaking factory workers on snowy March mornings to the make or break primary of California to the Miami streets filled with stoned protesters and Vietnam vets at the Republican convention.This book is worth reading for anyone who suspected that candidates put their shoes on one at time like the rest of us, or else need an aide to tie them. Hunter is at his vitrolic best taking on Humphrey, Muskie, AFL-CIO and Richard Nixon. Those parts are well worth the price of admission.I found the reading a little slow and meandering in the first third, better focused and spirited in the middle and downright fascinating at the end with Nixon (ugly and dark) and McGovern (inept campaigner) showing all sides for Hunter to tell us about with out pulling a punch. Thank you Hunter."
5,YOU GOTTA GET ONE OF THESE!!!!,"It's the best money I've ever spent!!! Cuts framing time in 1/2. The gun weighs nothing but yet is totally powerful... I love it!Anthony-Chicago,IL"
3,Good Gun:Bad Design,"I purchased two of these new models based on the experience that I have had with the NR83aa2's. Keep in mind that I run a framing crew and we rely on these guns all day every day. The gun shoots excellent. However, there is a piece of metal that acts as a lever for the retaining clip. On both of my newly purchased NR90ad's this piece of metal broke within the first three weeks and three weeks later I am still waiting for the parts. Long story short, that one one particular part that was poorly designed has turned what would normally be a great gun into a worthless piece of metal until those parts come in. 2-15-2005"
3,Ariel Costume ok,I expected the material to be higher quality and not so thin and flimsy.It is an average product at a high end price.
1,It came with no blade,This item came with no blade. It's useless. The picture shows that it come with a blade. Why it dies not come with blade
1,Disappointed,"The body of the knife is alloy, but the blade holder is a cheap piece of bent sheet metal that you have to fumble around with to hold the blade and get it in the right notches. I am disappointed in this purchase, especially since it is supposed to be a classic designed knife.Once I got it together it worked like a charm."
5,Will last you a lifetime....,"This is one of the simplest and most versatile tools on the planet. Stanley makes good stuff, and this utility knife is great. It is all metal and there are no plastic parts. It is all heavy grade aluminum, so it will not rust either.You can have the blade in three different spots depending on how much of the blade you want showing out of the end. The back end of the handle has a hole drilled for easy attachment to a tool belt, or to hang on a hook. You can store three extra blades inside, and extra blades are very inexpensive. To change blades all you have to do is remove the one philips head screw, the knife will separate into two halves, replace your blade, tighten the screw back down, and your good to go.I've had this knife for a few years already and it will definitely last for many years to come. You just can't beat the simplicity and value of this handy little tool."
5,A Stanley Classic,"The Stanley 10-099 has been an indispensable part of my toolbox for the last 7 years. It is completely rust/corrosion resistant. The shell or casing is made with hard anodized die cast aluminum and is practically indestructible! The rest of the utility knife are made with either aluminum or brass.The blade can be extended or retracted very smoothly and easily. It can be extended in 3 notches. The first notch barely exposes the blade and is ideal for, say, slitting open the packing tape on a box. The last notch fully extends the blade. Each notch securely locks the blade in place.The utility knife has a compartment for storing spare blades (the utility knife comes with 2 spare blades in the storage compartment).---The Stanley 10-099 is reliable, functional, and *extremely* durable. Highly recommended."
1,Jet engine loud!!!!,"i DO NOT recommend these! they are so loud they leave ears ringing throughout my house! i cut my husband's hair on a regular basis and got these when my old conair clippers started going out (hubby had taken them to the desert, go figure.) i've only used these a couple times because i can't stand the noise. last time, i tried doing it on our balcony so as to not wake the baby and you could still hear it in every room of our place. it has an adjuster screw on the side to adjust the speed of the blades/quietness overall, but if you get it to a reasonable noise then it won't cut hair - very slow and pinches all over. take my advice and stay away from them."
5,Amazing,This is definetely an amazing product and i would recommend it to everyone.Go buy it and enjoy!!!
5,It will pay for itself,This is the same clipper my barber has been using for years.I got tired of traveling to the barber and waiting for him to get to me.After the first 2 haircuts this thing paid for itself.Now that I have these clippers I can have a haircut anytime I want and I can maintain my hair the way it is instead of waiting for it to get messy to go to the barber. It comes with a tiny bottle of oil and instructions say to oil before and after use. I never saw my barber do that but I do it anyway. You might want to order a little oil too.Great product.
5,great clipper investment,"I purchased this particular clipper over 8 years ago under the guidance of my hairdresser ( who taught me how to cut my husband & two boys hair ) & it has been an incredible money saving investment! It still is running flawlessly, I am preparing to buy another just to have on hand, if and when it dies. I believe the key to a long life is taking care of it, reading the instructions and cleaning it regularly. I oil it and use the turn key adjustment slot on the side (which is what makes it so noisy) to clean out the hair at least every 2-3 cuts."
3,Hair Clippers,"Well im a hairdresser and have used these for yrs, mine got old so i ~bought the same brand and type again since i had such good sucess with the previous Wahl Clippers.They work great but they are so, so, Loud that it really hurts my clients ears as well as mine.ThanksCathy Amaral"
2,Too loud,"Too loud and ineffective and did not work well on curly hair. I would not recommend it, it gets 2 stars because it looks good lol"
2,You can pass this one up...,"I was first introduced to Euphone by a friend, with the self-titled album. Great drumming... this guy's got some chops. Then I heard ""Calendar of Unlucky days"". Wow. That album is where it's at. Funky beats, intricate layers of guitar and bass work...Definately Tortoise influenced, but not a bite of their style. Then I picked up the ""Breaking parole"" EP. I was really disapointed, it just doesn't have the flair that the self-titled shows hints of, and comes bursting through on the ""Calendar"". You can avoid this EP and not miss much, but at the rate Euphone has been improving with every release, I'd bet the family jewels that their next one will kick mucho booty."
1,Borrrrrring,"This book is extremely dull - a total snoozefest. However, a lot of people obviously enjoyed it or it wouldn't be so famous!"
3,hmmmm...,Chimera was good it is true but it was the start of a wrong turn. Acceleration is a great single but the rest is really not up to what he had done on the three previous albums.
2,Poor quality or operator error?!?,"I used this extension to reach the TV in my office. I duplicate one of computer monitors on the TV when working with clients. When I used this cable, the TV display was very yellow. Verified computer and TV color settings and adjusted, with no luck. Admittedly, this may be a setup problem - not sure. I bought a single cable that reaches the entire distance and the yellow tint went away."
3,"14 pins, not 15","There are 14 pins within the male connector, not 15 as advertised. Pin #9, which passes a +5V current for powering DDC circuitry, is absent. This is common for VGA extension cables but may not be what you need.If your screen is lacking in clarity, it may just be due to the length of the cable.The end."
3,Does the job but heavy,Very good quality but heavier than the cable that came with the monitor. That's why I only gave it three stars.
5,Large pack and small price,"Very pleased with the quantity and the quality of these blades. Undergoing an entire home renovation requires a lot of blades to cut up boxes, trim laminate flooring, trim baseboards, remove gunk from concrete floors... etc.These are great little helpers to have in the cabinet and the quantity is such, that we are not going to run out when we need it most.Fast shipping (if it matters)Low priceGood Quality.Tiny price.Hope this review helps."
2,Did not wash off high sulfur factory oil,"Did not clean off high sulfur factory oil. The blades were very oily with high sulfur cutting oil. It is smelly, greasy, and the reek doesn't wash off your hands easily. Made in USA standards have really gone downhill with ""free"" trade. This is industrial/corporate negligence. Ever try to wash and dry 100 toxic-smelling blades? I should have returned them."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This item is incredibly useful for cutting square tags for all kinds of art projects and crafts. I use them for making tags for gifts and cards. Be aware that the diagonal measurement of this ""Extra Large"" Block Party punch is 1.5"" and that the height and width of the punch itself is NOT 1.5"" - it is smaller! Also, when making ur tags please be aware that u will need scissors to cut near to where u want to punch your square tag - this punch does NOT cut your shape out anywhere on the page! It is soooo useful and makes ordinary words or pictures into attractive tags for any project you're working on. Highly recommend this punch! Easy to stack and store with other Fiskars punches. Enjoy...I certainly do."
1,Disappointing memoir of a few trips to Paris,"This slim volume records, and often self-duplicates, Paris dining experiences of a couple who think it's important to let the reader know what they did every day, as if they were writing a very long letter home or keeping a journal. I'm sure it would be a useful little book to show the IRS to defend writing off trip and meal expenses, but it is nowhere close to the excellence of coverage in the Hamburgers' Bistros of Paris or Patricia Wells's Food Lover's Guide to Paris. And to subtitle it ""Millenium Edition"" is pompous beyond belief, implying something very special to the reader."
1,Too personal,"I returned this book because it seemed to be about the author's personal experience when her grandchild was born. She mentions the child's uncle, the neighbors coming to visit and talking about their own baby's births, and other members of her grandchild's family. I felt it didn't focus on the baby and family you were intending the book for, but rather, on the author's own grandchild. My thought was, suppose the child you're buying the book for doesn't have an uncle, or grandfather? I did read someone else's review and that person mentioned the same thing. However, I felt it would be ok, despite what she said. Now, I have to agree with her."
5,Book Review,This was a used book and it was in great condition. The story is so sweet and it can be related to family experiences when a new baby is born. I recommend it to parents.
3,Be careful when filling,"I have used space bags in the past and have found that they do their job well. This model has a nice design because it has a relatively small footprint, is stackable, and the plastic part is protected by the canvas exterior, which makes punctures less likely.A big warning, however: do not overstuff these bags, as they will rip very easily. I was putting a large duvet in one a bit recklessly and the seam busted without a lot of resistance."
5,"Great space saver, high quality.",This space saver bag helps me keep all of my old down comforters stored clean and ready for guests without taking up an entire closet. The outer bag adds sturdiness and makes them stackable. I store these under my bed. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
2,Maybe I got a bad one?,"I normally am a huge fan of Space Bags. We have limited storage space and lots of big bedding items, and Space Bags typically make life much easier for me. This one, however, did not work at all. It was hard to pack items into due to the shape and size of the outer storage bag, and every time I tried to seal it (well within its limits, I know not to over-stuff) it snapped right back open. Even worse, the items I packed in it now have a very peculiar odor, almost like rancid oil. They were freshly laundered going in, and I used the bag within two days of getting it in the mail. I'm very disappointed."
4,Acceptable but not fabulous,"The vacuum packing works great and the bags with handles are quite convenient. Difficulties arose in shrinking the bag into the container though. The irregular shape the bag shrinks into is not the same shape as the container. After several tries I learned to kneel on the bag while it is compressing and near the end to stand on sections that were protruding. This allowed the bag to zip shut (with difficulty). The stacking others mentioned did not work so great for me. They did slide under the bed easily and were easy to retrieve. In the end, these are good to use to pack down my out of season comforters and clothes."
3,Space Bag Tote,"I was a little surprised because the picture made the item look larger than it is, but it does hold a lot and fits neatly underneath the bed. The sturdy sides protect the contents much better than the bag alone. I thought $20 was a little pricey, but when you amortize it over the years it will last, not bad. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another."
1,Garbage,"The plastic is paper thin and breaks very easy. The slightest pressure in the wrong way and you have a garbage bag. If Space Bag would invest a few cents more per bag for thicker plastic, this would be a good product."
5,Amazing!,"This is the best! I tried to save money by buying some extra cheap ones, but they didn't keep their seals- not very useful! This one on the other hand stayed sealed for over a month jam-packed and almost too heavy to carry. This is the most practical bag I have ever bought!!"
2,Lousy QA,"I ordered two f these. One worked fine, the other came with a hole in it that allows it to puff right back up in about a minute. That gave me long enough to wedge it under the bed, but I guess I don't know how I expect to get it back out. For $20 a pop they should be able to do way better."
1,Item Way Overpriced,"This exact same item sells for less that $7.00 at every other website and store on the planet. This site has priced this item too high, also this site has no contact information listed. Not a safe place to buy from."
1,Don't reward idiots,"The owners of the copyright on this work, Atrolabe, Inc. have filed a lawsuit against the maintainers of the time zone database which is used by virtually all modern software to accurately set timezones, claiming copyright violation due to this book being used as reference material. Due to this lawsuit the database has been taken offline threatening accurate timekeeping around the world. I would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this book so as not to reward the nearsighted and greedy behavior of Atrolabe, Inc. To be clear, the maintainers of the database reference this book specifically with publisher information and full attribution as a good source to consult for some of the data contained in the database and were rewarded for the good reference by being served a lawsuit over a usage that assuming it is even copyrightable (facts are not subject to copyright) should at least be protected under the rules of fair use."
1,Do not use,"Do not use this book if you intend to make use of the information you read. The authors are currently litigating against those who have made reference to information in this book.Essentially the authors are greedy, money-grabbing, selfish individuals who do not understand the legal precedent they set by attempting to sue for the copyrighted facts."
1,Worthless Company,"I can't believe you're suing an open source project, which uses some information from your book, which provides time-zone information for most of the worlds computing systems. This corporatisim gone wild. Be sure I will NEVER purchase anything from this company, much less this book."
5,Guyton's medical physiology,"As a hospital librarian, I have found Guyton's to be an invaluable resource. When I need to search for information on physiological processes that I don't fully understand, Guyton's is the first source I turn to.The language is clear and accessible, and the illustrations are helpful. The text does a marvellous job of presenting complex information in a way that can be grasped quickly."
4,A good classic,"I used this book for my Nurse anesthesia classes, from an instructor who also used it in medical school classes. It was invaluable in prepaing for my insanely difficult exams. It does need some updating, especially with regard to molecular biology. And I really suggest Purchasing Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology to suppliment the illustrations. Still, it was a generally clear and concise book which needed little supplimentation with other books."
2,In desperate need for an update,"Guyton has a marvellous talent for explaining Physiology, however, the info in the book is dated, a lot has happened regarding cardiac, smooth and skeletal muscle, neuroscience, metabolism, micturition etc etc.The part about immunology is very poor and should perhaps be removed since there are many much better texts on this subject..."
3,Good physiology book but Ganong is better,"As many other reviewers have stated Guyton's text is too long winded. Whilst some claim that this aids in reader comprehension and understanding, I find it superfluous and distracting. Another reviewer mistakenly said that ""..protein diets raise the GFR, but only Guyton tells you why "" Guyton SPECULATES on why (p293) high protein diets raise GFR. The book contains a number of inconsistencies (inaccuracies) and is prone to misreading and I my opinion promotes misunderstandings. Another criticism is the inordinate amount of type-set devoted to the results of animal experiments. Whilst this is important from a research perspective it means the text is far longer than it needs to be (this information could have been removed from the text and included in the end of chapter references). Please do not misunderstand me this is a good textbook, but it is old (2000) and not as good as Ganong's clearer, much more concise and more up to date text (2003)."
5,The BEST Medical Physiology Texbook ever!,"I advise every medical student to read from this great book. It might be time-consuming, but believe me once you read the beginning of any chapter, you still want to read it till you finish it! What makes reading even more interesting is the clinical relevance presented at the end of each chapter, which makes you understand the mechanism of a disease. Its biggest drawback is its lack of enough diagrams and illustrations, which if present are still poor, compared to other illustrated physiology books."
3,Need to be up-dated,"This a good traditional physiology book, but needs to have more up-date concepts about the molecular basis of physiology. The book is very extense,. but handle very old concepts. Now the molecular biology have and important impact in all areas of medicine, and I believe this book not include importat molecular concepts. The book was good before the molecular biology and gene revolution. I believe that the book handle past histoy."
4,Beautiful and Inspiring,"This book provides a tantalizing sampling of the extraordinary work of Frederick Fisher, a world-renowned architect based in Los Angeles. The text and pictures explore Fisher's aesthetic and pragmatic approach to designing buildings that establish and define truly beautiful spaces. This book left me wanting more pictures and words from this accomplished architect!"
4,anything but boring,"Okay, I am a latecomer to this book, but am in agreement with ""Hagar"". I can't believe ""Tart"" on this one: if there is one thing that Fisher is trying to do, it is to break out of the box, and he is, on the whole, very successful. Occasionaly, I see something that just doesn't work, like the awkward, not to say ugly, brick support on page 172. Fisher uses the same methods as any number of architects to break up the box: natural light, sometimes clerestory or skylight; complex spaces, a variety of materials, including exposed beams, and so on. I am giving this short review at this late date because I am happy to have this book in my collection, and would like to balance the rating for anyone else who does not yet have this book.Frederick Fisher Buildings and Projects"
1,Boring Boxes,"A collection of unimaginative dwelling units and galleries, which show the architect's inability to think beyond the box. Failing to grasp the complexities and juxtapositions of modern society, Mr. Fisher's architecture quickly dissapears into the unsightly bowels of banal coffee table literature (on a good day)."
2,Not a picture book for 4-7 yr olds..,"This is a chapter book, the chapters are short but it's a chapter book. What I was hoping for was a book to read my 5&7 year olds. Like his best book, ""The Pencil"", which we love.This book is way too long and involved to read to kids at night. Very disappointed."
5,plan for a disabled adult child,"Excellent book - provides guidelines for why, when, who and how. Even though we will use a lawyer, the advance prep should save us money, as they charge by the hour and we have a plan of what we want and who will handle instead of discussing and make these decisions ""on the clock""."
5,great book,Book does an excellent job of education on the SNT. I have used the sample SNT document and plan to use it after review by an attorney of a few changes I made.
4,SUBTITLE,WE FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WANT SUBTITLES...ALL PRODUCTS MUST HAVE SUBTITLES..THIS WILL INCREASE YOUR AND THE DISTRIBUTOR'S EARNINGS..PROFITS..SO YOU CAN SELL THEM ALL EASILY ..NEW OR USED..TO ALL WORLD..THANK YOU.
4,Great fun game,I bought this for my grandson who is 5yrs old and he loves it. It is also more durable then I expected.
2,"doesn't retract smoothly, color not as advertised","I bought this knife (and paid exorbitant shipping) only because it was listed as high visibility green, and I couldn't find anything but gray in my local stores. It's not high visibility green, it's standard gray, just like the picture. The seller offered to refund my money if I sent it back, thanks but no thanks given the item price vs shipping!Trying to load the knife was difficult, I couldn't understand the tiny picture that was the only instruction given. Perhaps I did it wrong, perhaps not, but the sliding gizmo that retracts and extends the blade does not move smoothly at all."
3,Sticks most of the time but so-so quality,"I bought this item to hold my Sirius radio to my windshield. My observations are as follows:- Falls off occasionally. I think it is related to temperature changes.- Requires the window be clean to stick properly...duh. You may have to use alcohol. However, you will need to clean the window and plastic suction cup again once it falls off.- One of mine cracked. Now when I stop short the flexi-stick slides out. The one that cracked was in the car that I take the radio in and out the most.- Really needs to be resting upon the dash to stick correctly. Otherwise you're placing too much faith in the suction cup.- The flexi-stick is kind of long which might make it a little bigger than you want for a small car."
3,Not as good as official OMC manual,"The manual offered by OMC is much much better, seloc's is a far cry from good, this rates along the clymer, chilton quality. For the same price, contact an OMC dealer and get the original so you can do the jog right. Given OMC Cobra's rep for gear eating problems, you should consult the OMC manual for correct cable adjustment procedures not found in the other manuals. This alone will save you $1000s of dollars."
2,SELOC OMC MANUAL,Terrible and confusing. Incomplete. Missing an entire critical section on transom cable adjustment. SELOC responds with silence when you ask them a question.
2,Some interesting music,"I think I got this CD for $1...I don't think it's worth much more than that. It's got a few interesting songs, some tempo changes. The lead singer has an interesting voice and singing style.For me the highlights are So Many Idols and Meat Market. I have to say it is pretty original. It's worth a listen, but I've had it for 6 years or so and have never been very enthralled with it."
1,Bought 2 one for self one for gift,"I purchased two of these televisions with extended warranty's. Within 6 months after the warranty experation The one I purchased for myself broke. Three months later the second one broke. I cannot recommend this product to my worst enemy let alone a friend. I have many Sony products in my home , and have had great results. I am quite disappointed with the television. I am having both of them repaired , and will update the review at a later date.I feel like I was held up and the robber took over $2000."
1,THIS SONY IS JUNK! STAY AWAY! FAILED TWICE IN 5YRS!,THIS TV WAS REAPIRED AT THE FACTORY REPAIR CENTER (NOT UNDER WARRANTY $350) AFTER JUST THREE YEARS. THEY SAID THE SOLDER JOINTS HAD FAILED! JUST TWO YEARS LATER THE UNIT WENT OUT AGAIN AND THERE ARE NO PARTS AVAILABLE THIS TIME. THE UNIT IS JUNK AND I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER SONY ANYTHING!! I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER SONY ANYTHINGI WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER SONY ANYTHINGI WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER SONY ANYTHINGI WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER SONY ANYTHING!I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER SONY ANYTHING!I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER SONY ANYTHING!ARE YA' PICKIN' UP ON THE ANGER HERE SONY???
5,"Excellent TV, reasonable price","I got this for USD one thousand and ninety-nine from Circuit City. Its heavy, but not as heavy as the screen size suggests - its about 130 lbs - some smaller CRTs weigh much more. HD chanels look very clear, sharp, colorful and high-resolution. No motion lag, of course, as in some LCDs. Has so many inputs (2 or 3 sets of component, composites (1 in front) and HDMI. Has a decent viewing angle. In short, if I were given the option of buying a HDTV in this prie range and screen size, I'd definitely buy this Sony."
2,I won't buy another Godinger,"The center of the sunflower has small round crystals that were not placed evenly, one was actually sitting half on another crystal. The green coloring on the leaves was bubbled and speckled on one of the leaves. There were fingerprints embedded in the crystal flower pot. I would have returned this product if I did not need it for a gift immediately, as it is I am going to apologize for the poor appearance and promise to replace it with something better when I have the chance to get it."
1,Dont buy!!!,"I rarely ever write reviews on these sites,, but had to make an exception on this item,,, Its truly a piece of junk,, as the other customer said the center of flower has glue all over the place,, there is glue on the pedals.. save yourself the disappointment and dont buy this!"
5,Beautiful Glass Sunflower,"The item is beautiful, arrived in good time and I am so glad that I got it for my friend. Thank you!"
2,Not Happy!,"I ordered a used textbook through a vendor selling on Amazon. I received the wrong version and have tried on 3 occasions to contact the vendor and 2 times to contact Amazon. I have not had much luck and still have the book! I justy want to get a refund or the right book!!!Had I known the return policy is difficult when dealing with the merchants, I would have NEVER purchased it. I've learned a lesson."
4,Satisfied,I am satisfied with the product and the shipping time was less than one week.Price good. No instructions of course.I have been happy with all of my purchases thru amazon.
3,a review,"This is a fun book about one my favorite Civil War battles. The book has good illustrations and it is overall attractively packaged and it is a good introductory book, but the text has a good many ""typos"" or just down right errors. It seems I have gotten a lot of books like this lately. Bad editing? Whatever."
4,Over Analyzed,"...Gear is expensive and hard to comeby. It doesn't matter who your are in the end you gotta make do with what you got. Jeans are high quality. Your beloved SEALS wore them in Vietnam. Swat teams and special units need to be big. That is not in the least bit unlikely. SEALs are probably the best at DA (direct action). They are young, tough and pumped full of macho Hooyah ism. However, against a trained numerically superior force they would be forced to evade or be over run. And they really didnt do all that bad. They caused more cassualties than they took.Most unlrealist thing was the size of the seals. Being that big and pure muscle you sink like a ruck. Seals a buff, but they are built for endurance along with strength.In the end this a a movie, the CQB was well done and alot of things were technically correct. However this is a movie."
3,A Useless and Brutal Act,"There is always something so heinous about the death of a child--especially if that death is at the hands of those they trust. We saw this in the deaths of the children in Houston at the hands of their Mother. This event happened nearly 50 years ago, and for those of us who remember it, it might as well have been yesterday. This is a well-written book and worthy of the effort of it's author.Mike Williams"
3,Thin t-shirt,"Overall, I'm happy with the product, but it was purchased to replace the exact shirt bought seven years ago, and side by side I can see they just don't make them like they used to. The old shirt is made of a thicker, much better quality t-shirt (and this this one is way worn out). Love the design, the screenprint looks great, the quality of the t-shirt is not the best. kind of a bummer."
4,Many Compliments,"Fits great, lovley design, beautiful colour, speedy shipping and good packaging. I get compliments all the time about this tshirt. My only con is that the cotton quality is a bit thin but its still washes okay."
5,nice shirt,I bought this as a gift for my husband. It fits well and has a great message. Love the logo.
4,"Bruce is incredible, the sound is not","I don't know why so many people are raving about the audio portion of this blu ray disc. It sounds like it was recorded in the middle of the Hyde Park crowd using a single microphone on a mediocre recorder. Maybe that's the goal of the engineer, but I was expecting something better than that. Aside from the sax and guitar solos, everything else about the instruments seems indistinct. The voices come across very well, though. What redeems the disc is Bruce himself - as always he gives the crowd its money's worth and more, putting on a tireless performance of a well-chosen set of songs. Despite the audio quality lacking (in my opinion), I was still smiling when watching this because the songs themselves are so good and so is the performance."
2,The audio sounds horrible,"I couldn't wait to buy this Bluray of the ""Boss"" but someone should call in the Trumpster (your fired!)on this one. The volume of Springsteens voice and the highend of the soundtrack is recorded so high that it must be listened to at a real low volume. I wish I could return it."
5,Best Live concert video to date,Love it. Really captures the Bruce concert energy. Excellent production both sound and video. Song selection is a great cross section spanning the spectrum of Bruce's writing talent.
5,Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band: London Calling-live in hyde..,"As always, anything with Bruce Springsteen live in concert are excellent. This man is amazing...can tell he loves singing, loves interacting with his fans/audience & gives his all in every concert--amazing!"
