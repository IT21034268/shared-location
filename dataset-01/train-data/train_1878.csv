1,really?,"So here it is: definitive proof that anyone with a few bucks can make a movie. I have to admit, I only watched the first few minutes. I would sum that segment up as follows: one time, there was this black man who was a communist. Give me a break."
4,"Very Interesting, Something to Think About","This was an interesting spin on things. I am not sure how much I believe, but the idea of Frank Marshall Davis being Obamas true dad was very compelling. However the nude pictures of Obama's mom, taken by Frank M Davis have scarred me for life. Well worth watching."
1,Misdirection and misinformation.,"I think that the best arguments do not need to rely on fancy window dressing in order to be realized as truth. The fact that the description lies and states that Barack Obama had anything to do with this film (rather than acknowledging that they were using an impersonator) made me skeptical. The film relies on flash and hyperbole, and isn't rhetorically sound. Be critical of the president if you choose, but don't rely on crazyness or flashy demagoguery to do it. The truth in a overly flashy, sensationalized spectacle such as this would be the truth if delivered in a dry and factual way."
1,Insane producer,The producer must be insane to make this kind of movie. He does need serious help. This is a right wing fantasy. Why is it even shown here.
1,Abysmal,"Waste of time. Suitable for numb nuts, and tea-braggers. Says nothing about the President, and is quite frankly insulting on many levels."
1,Un-watchable I hate Obama but this is absurd!!!,This is (documentary) is utterly ridiculous. They should move it to the fantasy section. Or maybe Amazon can create an option for movies made by paranoid delusional film makers. Like I said in the title. I hate Obama but this is absurd and petty. Even if the bologna this guy made up were true it would not matter. WHO CARES!!!
5,Every Patriotic American Must See This,"Joel Gilbert is a true Patriot and has shown true grit and courage in producing this astounding documentary which is a timely wake up call to America.The DVD is 100% accurate and should be compulsory viewing for every patriotic American who wants to know the truth about Obama's hidden agenda.Congratulations Joel Gilbert you have performed a great service to America in exposing the most fraudulent a deceptive President in American history.It's time for America to wake up and realize that Obama has been on a ""Destroy the USA"" crusade from the day he took office"
1,A poor example of amateur fiction,Any narrative that is comprised of re-creations of rather improbable events and fantastic speculation is fiction; fortunately fiction of this quality requires nothing more than a star and a sentence.
1,Ridiculous,"I weep for my country and the idiocracy it is becoming. Faux News, Drudge and Weekly World News are doing you and this country no favors. What you call mainstream media the rest of the world calls journalism. What you call socialism used to be known as compassionate conservatism. And what you are calling ""questions"" are nothing more than masked racism. Don't doubt it. Your views are going the ways of the dinosaurs and it can't happen fast enough."
5,A MUST SEE BEFORE YOU VOTE! LIBS MUST BE GIVING BAD REVIEWS SO YOU DO NOT SEE IT!,"This is a Must see for every voter. Do not listen to the other reviews, That say this movie is not any good? There is so much to learn in this movie the Main Stream Media will never tell you. I am telling you it is shameful if you do not watch this and share this with other viewers. Some say this movie is a lie?? It is all propaganda? No, Obama sure did have a nose job in 2002. Look at other You Tube Videos? His Mother posing naked for Frank Marshall Davis? So much Information.. Knowing Bill Ayers for 21 Years? It all fits like a puzzle..If you cannot see it then God Help us!"
1,Insane fraud,"This is insane, and slanderous.If you're taking this seriously you're deeply sick.None of what they claim makes any sense.Fear driven political propaganda isn't that hard to spot either.On most of the points they try to make, their definitions are just bad, they don't understand political systems very well at all.If you take this seriously you should probably seek help because you need it.Looking on nearly any credible site about what for instance communism is will show how nutty this drivel is.Hatred and insane theories only contribute to a rich history of crazy behaviour surrounding political parties, this type of sordid trash is the sort of thing most people try to avoid.At some point it makes sense to not indulge crazy people, it's too bad there's no way to filter media this awful.Too much of this stuff and people forget simple things, like Occam's razor."
2,No so impressed,This portrays some people that were in Obama's life but not impressed with the quality of the movie.Too much info in so little running time.
2,Incredible subject: irresponsible filmmaking,"The great tragedy of this film is the fact that Joel Gilbert squandered so much incredible research on such an amateurish production. He makes a strong case for the true parentage of the president and in doing so reinforces to thinking people how little we actually know about him . But Gilbert the opportunist can't hold back from one cheap shot after the other --- including ""Betty Page "" pornography pictures of his mother . To what greater purpose is that suppose to lead us? As much as some conservatives detest the president does viewing nude photographs of his mom in her youth advance our cause? I think not , and in fact only leads one to a grudging admiration for a kid who coming from such circumstances eventually rose to the nation's highest office."
1,Obama is Elvis and E.T.'s Love Child!,"I'm unsure about this DVD. On the one hand, it seems to tell the truth about President Obama being the love child of William Shatner and Mary Tyler Moore, but on the other hand by doing so it has Obama being born in Hawaii, when everyone knows he was born in Zimbabwe, Switzerland. Simple proof that Obama was NOT born in Hawaii... have you ever seen him eat pineapple????"
1,"Low budget hit piece chock full of guesswork, very short on facts.","I cannot believe that anyone would watch more than 10 minutes of this, without realizing that they just wasted their hard earned money. If guessing what someone thinks Barack Obama is thinking about is a fact, then this is your docudrama. It's far, far away from being a documentary. It's cheesy Flash graphics, make it look like it was created by a 10 year old, with his daddy's old Pentium 4, Windows XP computer. Welcome to the continued dumbing down process, that is passing as a documentary. Total Junk! EDIT, Many of the reviewers of this junk are obvious shills, that have one review on Amazon. Check out a few of the 5* reviewers history. They either don't have any or just a few items."
1,"Garbage, garbage, garbage","I must have been pegged by a computer as an undecided voter in a swing state as I received this video free of charge in the mail. Undecided voters want real information to help them make a decision. If the Romney campaign is stooping to the free distribution of lies and deception, why do they think I would ever want to trust them to lead this country."
1,Trash,It bothers me that in this day and age in America people are willing to believe such baseless propaganda. It's nothing but slander and fear tactics! It sickens me
1,Terrible,"Trashy and useless fiction. If you are looking for a legitimate story about Obama, this is not it. There are no facts, and it only serves as an election year hit piece."
1,This was a horrible buy for me and i'm REPUBLICAN!,"I dont like President Obama not one bit at all, but i must say that this was a horrible film it didnt give legitimate proof that Frank Marshall Davis is Obama father. It had inconclusive evidence that this guy was his father. All it points out is that they both talk alike and look alike BUT DONT ALL BLACK PEOPLE LOOK ALIKE and talk like each other? Come on people this is our strategy to take back over office and get the House back. This made no sense and the guy that made this Doc is an idiot. We waste our time on dumb shit like this. I dont see the crazy Liberals making a doc on George W. Bush claiming that the late Texas governor Bill Clements was his biological father because its not true and they are busy trying to find strategies to keep the rather than make dumb stuff like this. COME ON LETS FOCUS ON REAL TOPICS so we can beat the Liberals and take back the house."
1,This is The Onion mating with Mad Magazine.,"Hate mixed with desperation produces scary results.Remember Ross Perot dropping out of the 1992 campaign after threats to embarrass his daughter the same way?Didn't the Nazi's believe that certain people had visual traits quantified in books and movies?Hollywood has made it's reputation on finding look alikes in certain poses. Photo faking is as old as photography.So now the GOP has sunk to a smear campaign where the President's mother was a porn queen. And they have reimagined Obama Sr. as a guiless Harvard PhD, lending his good name to a charade, with Frank Marshall Davis as a pornographer, Marxist who is the President's real father?Mitt Romney should be ashamed of himself for lending his good name to such purile trash."
1,Teabagger fodder,"Utterly horrible. Fabricated right wing propaganda.This doc contains the usual emotionally charged rhetoric aimed to elicit a highly adverse reaction to the subject of the doc. Picture a field populated by brain dead conservative sheep, drooling, with the occasional look of total racial hatred flashing across their faces. What is sad is that they are easily swayed by scary words like ""socialism""! When for some odd reason they are totally unaware of the corporate socialism that has created a huge chasm between what is increasingly becoming the super rich, and the peasants. I would not be surprised if this was funded by the koch brothers."
1,Fiction of a loosing party,For the people who watch and believe this you need seek help.Much of this is fabrication and signs of a desperate party.Electing Mitt is like re-electing Richard Nixon - Lies will never stop if he won.Sad these fake ideas pop up. even when proof has been given to the contrary.
3,Leaves the important point out,"This guy can really overwhelm you with data, but he doesn't deal with the important part: no one has ever seen Ross Perot and Barack Obama on stage at the same time. It's notorious. And this is the real clue. What's the producer of this thing trying to hide. Ever since the time it became clear that Ross Perot was born in Mexico, whatever his phony ""Birth Certificate"" says, the media just keeps giving him a pass. And look what happened!"
1,Preposterous,"It is astonishing how far people will go to discredit this President. By the way, have you heard that Adolph Hitler is Mitt Romney's great-great uncle? Adolph and Mitt's grandfather were lovers, and conspired to create a set of circumstances in which Mitt would be born and rise to become a Presidential candidate. It has all been preordained. There is no evidence of it because it was so successfully shrouded. Shhh... But the notes of the trilateral commission give hints from which we can divine this god-sent truth, and page 2012 of the Warren Commission report, footnote number 4, presents additional and irrefutable proof. And don't overlook the 32nd edition of the Zoroastrian bible, in the book of monkeys. This is just flat out fabrication."
5,A must see for every american,This film is inspiring. It shows a true point in what our presidents true colors are. We believe in the message this film is sending. We're hosting a public view party because of how powerful it is.
1,Fever dreams and the prayers of mad men,"Watching this film and realizing that some people will actually believe the information presented by it has made me lose faith in humanity. The United States is not in danger of ""becoming socialist"", it is in danger of being destroyed by an out of touch citizenry."
1,IF ONLY I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS..,I cannot believe people are so stupid they can even entertain that any of this book can be taken seriously. It is a sad day when our freedom of speech allows for such lies and deceit. This book is not only stupid and based on lies; it smears the great President of our United States of America. The people who made this product should be laughed off if it were not so evil and slanderous. I give it 0 stars!
1,Ridiculous,"Propaganda paid for and sponsored by the ultra-rich. Brings back memories of propaganda in the Soviet Union like ""Pravda"". If you like to watch fiction, fantasy, or just plain old crappy stories, then this is just for you."
1,Racism Disguised as Anti-Socialism,"The whole idea that Obama is this or that, is based on the idea that he is ""other,"" not us, not American, not white, not a businessman, not a Christian, etcetera.These names they call the president all come from a fantasy created by people who don't understand complex ideas like the fact that the world is changing and the United States is changing (for the better and for the worse).After 8 years of George W. Bush ruining the country, you'd think people would give the new guy a break, but rather, they've developed this fantasy that this black guy running the United States of America is turning the country into some sort of USSR.This movie is plainly stupid, offensive and shameless in taking advantage of people's racism and fears."
1,"Pathetic, Racist Garbage","As an Iraq veteran who served honorably in the US Army, this film offends me. To slander our Commander-in-Chief with such utter nonsense is an affront to all Americans. Thankfully for them, the producers of this racist trash enjoy the protection of the First Amendment. In any other country, they would be up against a wall; not for lying about the President, just for making such a sad excuse for a film."
5,SUPER INTERESTING!!,"I really enjoyed watching this.The case is well presented. And I wonder will we ever know the truth.Production quality, and seems well researched and very probable."
1,Lies,"Are there really so many stupid people out there? Why would you believe anything in this movie, it is clear from the description that it is not based on any facts although it tries to claim such. Unbelievable that the director and everyone else involved is getting away with this."
1,"Mean-Spirited, Intellectually Lazy, Opportunistic Drivel","I'm a person of faith, so I need to comment here:Proverbs 14:5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.Unsure what propaganda looks like? This is it.Ridiculously bad ploy to propagate lies and innuendo., this thinly veiled collection of untruths and twisted fairytales seeks to sway the ill-informed and bolster the legion of head-in-the-sand, ditto-zombies.I try to be a moderate, open to other points of view, but this kind of thing makes me angry. There's no other word for it, but evil. People of integrity must stand up in TRUTH to make our Republic truly strong.Do your own research, for goodness sake."
1,No Real Truth to This Movie..,"I reviewed this movie and there are no real facts.. The Fake Obama Voice is so Silly! SNL can do a better impersonation..lol.I would not give this movie any stars based on the fake content of this C rated production.. But since I have to give some sort of rating, I will give it 1' star for being one of the silliest movies ever...boring!"
1,You Scare Me,"The saddest thing about this steaming pile of delusion is that there are actually people on earth who could believe it. It is a sub-right wing fantasy devoid of even trivial facts. I don't mind fiction, but this isn't even good fiction. This is the movie for you, if your life's purpose is wielding your white hot anger at unicorns & dragons. It will look great on the shelf next to the collector's plates.Or, come back to reality. A better use of your time would be...I don't know, smoking meth & watching wrestling."
1,An amazing drama - full of intrigue and suspense,"This movie was amazing, it had suspense, drama, laughs, intrigue, everything you could want from a good drama. Wait, what's that? This is supposed to be ... true? I thought it was a drama with an awful Obama impersonator making a joke about all the idiot birthers.Seriously, to call this a documentary is an insult to documentaries, there is not one ounce of fact in the whole thing, if you are looking for documentaries about the president or his administration, stick to PBS, this is pure garbage."
1,Try PBS instead,"Instead of this, I recommend the PBS Frontline documentary ""The Choice 2012"" on the early lives of both Romney and Obama. Unlike this, it is fascinating and even handed."
5,Astounding account of good journalism,"A journalist's job is to get a true story out, and leave enough for the general public to ponder for weeks if not months. Director Joel Gilbert already succeeded tremendously at this job. Gilbert bamboozles us with an understand so large it leaves little room for sanity: in 2008 America got conned by the first affirmative action president."
1,Fodder for cretins,A waste of time! Next they will tell you is Obama is from outer space. Our president is not a WASP. Get over it.
1,Paranoid and blatently racist,"One characteristic that drug addicts exhibit after too much abuse is paranoia. In this case, the drug addicts are the right-wing Teabaggers, and right now, they are full-blown junkies. In addition to being a user, director Joel Gilbert has gotten into the drug dealing business by peddling out nonsense like ""Dreams from My Real Father"" to a drug-hungry audience, and the product isn't even that good. But not to worry--they are so desperate to score some dope that they'll buy garbage like this anyway.Like any addiction, the first step is admitting you have a problem. For people like Gilbert and the Teabaggers, their problem is that, despite all evidence to the contrary, they invariably resort to calling President Obama a radical Maoist/Marxist/Communist/Socialist/Leftist/Fascist. They really ought to get some help.Another title for this DVD could be ""I Think the Black Guy is up to No Good.""Thank you for finding this review helpful."
2,Video Lack Definitive Proof,"I don't like Obama. I didn't vote for him. I think he is a Muslim, a Socialist and the great prevaricator. I am sure he was greatly influenced by Frank Marshall Davis, but the book did not provide definitive that Davis was his father. The music was over bearing. I recommend any of Dr. Jerome Corsi's books about Obama over this video."
3,Eveyone should see,"Content on President Obama was from a different but believable perspective. If video is accurate, his father is not Kenyan but rather a Weatherman type, left wing, African American with his true father's heritage grounded heavily in socialism. You be the judge. The DVD was informative but continually ""skipped"" and stopped during play. A little hard to view but content has relativity."
1,dishonest fraud,"How anyone could be taken in by this dishonest, mean spirited hack job is beyond me. There are so many people out to get Obama who at least have the decency to stick to half truths, but this is beyond lies."
1,A terrible conspiracy film. Only whack-job nuts will enjoy.,"Save yourself an hour and 30 minutes of jumping over to snopes.com to discovery that all the basic tenets that the ""facts"" are based on are already repudiated rubbish.I'm ashamed that people can make a living making this garbage. It's a glorified, film version of something out of ""National Enquirer""."
1,Not based in reality,"The only reason this exists is to spread lies and slander. If you are really interested in Obama's history, do your own research and get your information from multiple sources. This is entirely the opinion of a small group of people who should not be trusted when it comes to the truth."
1,More right wing delusional thinking.,This is an obvious hit piece. Is a review really necessary? It is too bad that zero stars isn't possible!
1,Shame on you Amazon,"I am totally appalled that Amazon would add this to their Prime free streaming video list a few weeks before the most important presidential election of our lifetimes. We know who President Barack Obama's father is. We know the President is a strong, steady, intelligent leader. We know some people hate him because he is a black man. Must you showcase this bigotry? Shame on you Amazon for trying to influence this election. Make people pay the regular price to see this. Or better yet, put it in the fiction section."
1,I want my time back... and I only watched (could stand) 5 minutes,"I'm not a fan of Obama.However, this film is offensive to this conservative as the film ""Innocence of Muslims"" was offensive to Islam. Yes, that poorly done, if you cared to see what the hype was about. This film could be used by liberals to show how stupid conservatives are. Especially if they buy into this type of propaganda.This film is terrorism against critical thought.This film is story telling for the Honey Boo Boo set.For conservatives who wish to get a real look at Obama, just watch his actions and read his words... But don't waste your time on this garbage. As a previous reviewer said ""Free is not cheap enough..."" and me: I want my time back. I only could stand 5 minutes of this pedantic drivel."
1,Lies,This is a total hate and lie campaign against Obama. I'm a republican and I thought this was an insulting and uninformative film. Don't watch or buy this.
1,Total Fabrication,"This is absolute garbage. A collection of far fetched lies, this book is a weak attempt to slander the President of the United States. The author is just another sad far right nutjob. Unadulterated crap."
1,Scam Artists,"This is just a scam artist trying to scam money from rich, racist republicans. They are so desperate to defeat Obama that they gave this scam artist millions to copy and send his crappy dvd to millions of people for free in swing states. Yeah, that's right. Over a million people have received this dvd in their mailboxes for FREE. The DVD is nothing but a conspiracy theory with absolutely no evidence to back up any claims. They basically just made up stuff to scam rich, ignorant Republicans."
4,Well worth a look!,"I don't usually write reviews but this documentary really seems to ""connect the dots"" about why so much of President Obama's past hasn't been ""open and honest"" like he claims to be. I was very impressed with ""2016, Obama's America"" the book but this documentary seemed to explain more about his personal involvement with the ones that helped mold his political views. It also made me think that his Kenyan father story is just another cover-up. I didn't give the documentary 5 stars only because without real proof, some of the content is just theory."
1,I want my money back.,This was garbage. My five year old sister could have done a better job with her crayons and a camera phone than this slop. I have a very hard time believing that anyone spent two years on this. It was extreme amateur hour.
1,Obama Mockumentary,"The maker of this video, Joel Gilbert is also the maker of ""Elvis Found Alive"" and the bizarre ""Paul McCartney Really is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison."" Joel Gilbert specializes in mockumentaries that feature fabricated ""found"" audio and footage. This limits his credibility as a serious documentarian. Those looking for skeletons in the Obama closet, would do well to look to someone with a track record that has more real news. ""Dreams of My Real Father"" is not it. Please check out an interview with the director Joel Gilbert about the ""Paul McCartney"" video at <...>"
5,Amazing,This film has opened my eyes even more to a theory I've had. It's simply brilliant and I am holding a public screening night this weekend because it's so powerful. Good work and thank you for having the courage to express this to the world.
1,Absolute Trash,"Just received this unsolicited piece of garbage in the mail today. It could not be more offensive, hateful, and un-American. Welcome to the modern politics of the Tea Party and Citizens United!"
1,Slander,"If you enjoy this film, you are either someone who enjoys self serving self delusion or are very, very stupid. If Obama were not president, he would likely sue the filmmaker for slander, but in his current position, he cannot be seen to even acknowledge the existence of this tripe. If the producers and filmmaker force his hand, it will go badly for them in the courts since it is illegal to baselessly harm someone's public reputation."
1,Hate filled lies from the hateful right,Hate and lies produced by the rightwing. All they have left is hate and deception. This is a product of racism and bigotry and shares no more truth than all of the other conspiracy theories the right puts out.
4,disturbing and thought-provoking,"There has been an air of mystery surrounding Barack Obama ever since he began his campaign for president. His actions during the 3-1/2 years he has served as president have only created more mystery and speculation. This documentary provides a very logical hypothesis to explain Obama's origin, his upbringing, his association with radicals and Marxists, and his real plans for America. The faux first-person narration detracts from the intellectual thought that went into this film. If you can overlook that one distraction you will find the rest of this film to be very enlightening, disturbing, and thought-provoking not only about Obama himself but the large number of people in America today who support what he's trying to do. This is a film that should be viewed and shared with others so all can understand what Obama's ""hope and change"" and his plan to ""fundamentally transform America"" is really all about."
1,Idiotic claptrap; dishonest propaganda for conspiracy theorists,"Frankly, I'm surprised that Amazon Prime is posting this video as a ""documentary"". I understand a documentary with a slant but you can't include whole-cloth lies and speculation using words such as ""I think"" and sell it as actual factual truth. This is more in the category of the shows that try to prove that Jesus was an alien... If I could give it zero stars, I would.On the other hand, if you really get into the idea that the US government flew the planes into the towers, you should enjoy this."
1,only the most gullible,"Only the most gullible among us would consider this anything but a ridiculous journey into partisan conspiracy theory. More importantly, this movie was clearly produced by people who don't know much about history, Marxism, socialism or any other ism. Honestly, the people who gave this four stars probably never watched it, and wrote the reviews just because they're already convinced that our right-of-center president is a Marxist. What a load of hog wash, and about as realistic as Harry Potter."
1,Fact Checkers are GOOD,"What a load of horse excretement. Do your own research; there are no facts involved with this production. The truth is accessible, be discerning. Knowledge is power."
1,Not fooled,"Seems very strange this 'documentary movie' comes out during the 2012 presidential election. I watched the whole thing, never saw a shred of truth. Only twisted phrases and pictures made up by the person who created it."
5,I never would have believed it,"I don't want any of it to be true. Maybe some of it is. Maybe most of it is. I don't know... but if you've seen any of the glorious news coverage that Obama has received in the last 4-5 years, you must have thought to yourself ""is there more to this story?"" Turns out there is."
5,A masterpiece of investigative reporting,"Awesome journalistic expose. This is the kind of work the networks once aspired to. One has to admire the courage it took to put it together and get it out there in front of a hostile media and political left (just look at the other reviews on here. They cannot bear to have the truth known. Imagine if this were by Michael Moore about Bush. Not a peep.). The entire production caught me off guard as I was expecting it to be a re-hash of things I had already heard. But from the opening title onward, it grabbed my attention with it's outside-the-box revelations, documentation to back up every claim, and clarity of presentation. I only hope that enough people see it before the election. It also put a real, human face on Obama's pop persona. It actually made me see him as a flawed human being; not one I want as president, but largely the product of an estranged upbringing and unchecked influence by those who sought to exploit his strengths and weaknesses."
1,Lies,I'm a registered independent so I received a lot of propaganda in the mail during the election campaign. Mostly from Obama haters. This was poorly made and full of lies.
3,A good idea yet the basic material is too regularly mediocre,These tapes may be a good summary of the ideas covered in an MBA program however the ideas are of average quality meaning that someone with an MBA would be qualified to maintain the status quo vs to seek a higher level of serving customers better in my view. The material may be more a reflection of University academia vs the real business world it seems to me. Several observers have noted that much of what is taught in many universities is material 20 years old (aka living in the past vs today).
5,I can't believe I found this CD!,"This CD has been out of print for quite some time. I lost my original CD during some personal hardships 10+ years ago. I've been searching for this for years (literally) and am SO glad to have found it. Dealing with a great seller only made it that much better. Thanks again Amazon, for putting together another ""make my day"" deal for me!!"
2,"This book is not worthy of the label ""Study Guide.""","Being a college student who has years of working experience with computer systems, I was very disappointed with this book. The included CD with the whole text in PDF format, electronic flash cards and exams all sounded great until I realized how many errors the text contained. As I worked through it, I noticed many errors both in the text and with the end-of-chapter review exams. When I would take the exams and get a question wrong, I'd read the answer's explanation which was erroneous, and then I would have to spend time drudging back through some erronous and contradictory text in a futile attempt to find the correct answer. I finally got so frustrated I went to the Sybex website and looked at the errata for the book, and there was quite a bit (about 6 pages worth). In fact, I even found two additional problems which I emailed them about. This text is simply a laughable attempt at a reliable study material."
3,This book is overkill for the A+ Exam.,"While I appreciate the detailed knowledge this book covers, it is overkill for the A+ exam. I would say that there were no questions related to 60% of the areas covered by the book. The proctor for the exam told me after the exam, and I now agree, that there is too much information in this book and recommended A+ Exam Cram for those taking the exam."
1,This book is pretty much worthless.,"Do NOT buy this book for A+ study!! It is full of erroneous information. For instance, it states that the WIN2000 CD is not bootable but it is. It stated that the switch for installing accessibility options with WIN2000 was winnt.exe /h. This is wrong as well. Those are just a couple of examples. I passed the tests but it was in NO WAY from any help from this book. This book would be good for a beginner to learn more about computers but not someone who is about to spent [some] of their hard-earned money on certification exams. Avoid it like the plague!"
2,Misses the boat on 60% of the info on the exam.,"Although this book was packed with good info, much of the exam I took was not covered by this text. I did pass with an 82% on the first try, but this book doesn't deserve the credit for my passing score. This book should be used along with others to ensure adequate coverage."
2,A long read with minimal value,"From the size of this book you would think this is a ""Complete"" reference for the A+ exams but indeed it is not. It covers older technologies too extensively, and spends many pages not covering newer technologies on the Adaptive Exams in sufficient detail. The author seems to enjoy reciting legacy computing lingo more than providing useful information. As noted by other reviewers there are obvious errors in the book and CD practice questions. Also many of the CD questions relate to terms and topics that are no longer even relevant. Daisy wheel printers? Planar board? Punch cards?If you want to know the history of computer technology then buy this book. Otherwise go with a book more suited to the new Adaptive exams like A+ Adaptive Exams by Christopher Crayton. This book is a much better study guide, and the OS section is vastly superior."
2,A+ Complete Study Guide - Not Enough Information,"I bought this book with the hopes of preparing me for the new A+ certification exams (220-301 and 220-302). This book fell way short. The information in the book is good and informative but most of it is not on the tests. If it weren't for the fact that I've been in the IT business for over 15 years and because of my experience from this line of work, I would have failed the tests miserably! Also, there are MANY typos in the book. So many, in fact, that I quit counting. It was somewhat distracting. It's apparent the book was not proofread well before being published.If you are wanting a book to study that will prepare you for passing the A+ exams, this isn't the one you want to buy."
3,Lacks OS Info,"This book really helped me on the Hardware portion of the test, and I would recommed it for that fact. When it comes to the OS portion of the test, the book falls way short. I passed the test due past experience, not due to the book. I was ill prepared for the OS test after studing over two weeks."
4,This book helps if you've some experience.,"If you've built your own PCs at home and have a couple of years of experience using Windows, this book is enough to help you pass the A+.The Hardware part is great and very detailed.The OS part is adequate but doesn't really hit the marks on the exam. I had to rely on my pc experience to pass the OS exam.Overall, any person with a decent amount of PC knowledge will pass the A+ exams with no problem using only this book."
2,Think before you waste your money!,"This book has a really good looking cover. That's where it all stops.Although the A+ course is covered in reasonable detail, This is not a book for beginners. A lot of background and important detail is left out and it is all presented in a confusing way.My copy is now a doorstop.Do yourself a favour, look at the A+ books by Micheal Meyers or Charles J. Brooks. At least you will get the full picture and will have a reference manual for the future."
1,Not recommended for the A+ Exam,"I cannot recommend this Book for the A+ Exam.The A+ Topics are discussed in a hard and unpleasant way. After reading 350 pages, i had to stop reading and had to look for another A+ training Guide. It is not as easy to learn for the exam with the book from David Groth as with other books.During the exam, i realised that most of the discussions in this book haven't anything to do with the real A+ exam. So this Book isn't very Exam related.Don't waste your time with this book, there are other, much better A+ Training Guides out there."
4,Very good but needs a of bit of updating,"I passed my exam the first time (both CORE and OS). I was a bit disappointed as there were few things missing about win 2000 in the second part. Even in practice tests and in flashcards for OS, Win 2000 is not dealt ""in depth"" from A+ exam point of view. On the whole a very recommendable book"
3,"A+ Deluxe, NOT Complete","I passed both exams with scores of 875 (Hardware) and 913 (OS). This book helped me, but not all the information is available. It took me two times to pass the OS exam. The most important aspect of studying for the exams is taking practice exams. The more questions you encounter, the better you'll understand the test. I would recommend this book as a first read, than move on to something more technical. Mike Meyer's A+ Passport is a good book to have."
3,"A Good Start, But OS Section Is Weak","If you don't have a lot of field experience to bring to the table, this book alone won't get you certified in the OS section. While the hardware section is good (I passed on my first try), the OS section is lacking. I have failed the OS section twice (which is expensive), even though I studied and know everything in this book. Failed my second OS test today, and I swear there were questions in the test that were not even tagentially touched on in this book.I'm going to try Myers book to see that will fill in the gaps.Hope you have better luck than I did."
4,Helpful Book!!,This book helped me pass the A+ exam with flying colours (90%). Very comprehensive coverage of exam objectives with some useful video clips. The cd tests were good practice before the exam. I would buy this book plus the Mike Myers A+ book to keep your bases covered. I found having two different authors explaining a concept helps alot.
2,"OS section is good, but this book is lacking","OS section did a good job covering Windows 2000/NT/98/95 and DOS. The hardware section was lengthy, but studying it alone would not allow you to pass the hardware module of the adaptive A+ certification test. I passed, not because of this book, but experience.There were several gaps left unfilled between the actual test and this book. For instance, I was asked a question on the difference between ATA/66 and ATA/33. Neither cable is mentioned in this book. Another question delt with the difference between an AT mobo and an ATX. After looking back in this book, the answer was not there. There are several other examples like this. My advice...look elsewhere, especially at this price."
2,"A ""Complete"" Frustration","I had the same experiences with the other reviewers in that the review questions were occasionally inconsitent or outright wrong. The included CD mostly had tests for exams other than the A+. The book gets two stars because of its sheer volume of information, but who really cares how DOS 6.22 manages memory? I haven't had the need to use those techniques since Win95, and I haven't encountered a Windows 3.1x machine in over five years. Find another book."
1,It broke in a hurry,"I ordered only one of these water nozzles even though I really need two; one for the front and the other for the back yard. But I thought I would get just one and see how it worked out. Well, the plastic handle has just broken and it is not even June yet! This is close to getting a Xmas present and then watching it break a few days later.So I will try to order a new plastic handle from Gilmour but meanwhile, I will continue my method of ordering just one nozzle from another source until I find the right one. But maybe Gilmour will stand by their product and redeem themselves!"
1,This nozzle is junk,This nozzle lasted all of about a week. It was used to was a car twice. On the second washing it was dropped from hand held height to the ground. The plastic on the back of the nozzle broke off. It is now unusable. Very poor design.
3,Good but not enough,"This book is a good, general introduction to the 70-229 exam concepts - but I had to couple it with the Transcender practice exam before I felt comfortable taking the exam. The exam topics are so broad that the book doesn't do enough to emphasize when to use what. It also skips some important topics (sp_cursoropen) and its practice tests include Full Text Searches which the book notes are unlikely to be on the exam. To the editors: A 'databases' index entry with three pages of sub-entries is redundant in a book about databases. I love the Exam Cram series, but this was the poorest book of the bunch."
2,"Good book, bad CD","The content provided by the book was great. Unfortunately my main reason for buying it was the accompanying MeasureUP practice test. The publisher should have definitely chosen a different vendor for the practice test. The MeasureUP exam utility is so poorly designed that unless you are running default regional settings it will not be able to provide a timer or a score. I had my PC set to use 24 hour (military) time instead of AM/PM. This one minor setting caused their application to die. Anyone who has ever written a single line of Visual Basic code knows that you should always format the incoming dates and times. To trust that every PC in the world has the same regional setting is foolish. If you like using practice exams for Microsoft products that would not even make it through first round of testing at Microsoft, then buy this book. Otherwise, we should strongly encourage the publisher to choose a better practice test vendor."
2,Good if you want a guide to what you should remember,"I previously studied and aced the 70-228 exam and obtained a wealth of information from 'Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Unleashed' (ISBN 0672324679). It had enough information for both that exam and this exam. I've never used an Exam Cram book before and have to say I was disappointed. While it occasionally passed on some specific info, it was more like a guide that tells you a topic is important and that you should study it! If you want to learn and understand how/why you are to do something, this book doesn't cut it. If you want a guide to give you a few quick facts and then tells you to study other materials, then this guide is fine. I was expecting something along the lines of a concise listing of what you needed to know without delving into non-exam topics (which was fine by me after reading the exhausting 1500 book I mentioned above); but, this is anything but concise."
1,This kinda stuff gives garage rock a bad name,"Remember the Fuzztones? No? Well, if you don't remember them consider yourself lucky. If you do then you know the type of music contained on this disc. Flaccid retread of 60's garage punk done with a kitschy, revisionist's take on things that reduces the awesome music they seem to worship into some kind of [bad] parody. I bet they wear matching outfits on stage too. Geez, I can't believe bands like this still exist!"
5,EASIEST TAPE DISPENSER TO USE,"This dispenser is one that the office supply stores don't seem to want to stock. They only want to stock the real expoensive and complicated ones. I find that the tape gets all caught up in the expensive dispensers, and you can't contol the tension on the tape to get the box or package real tight.This dispenser is easier to use, less expensive and very durable.I bought 4 of them."
3,At least the tape stays where it should.,"I haven't been able to use this tape dispenser the way it's shown. I have bot pull it out manually and across my box, then use the dispenser to cut the tape; but at least the tape stays straight, doesn't tangle and doesn't frustrate me like some of them do. I think it's over priced for a plastic tape holder, and though I will continue to use it, I wouldn't buy it again."
1,cheap made,"I am not sure what is going on with these batteries but the vendor has replaced 3 of them for me. after a couple of weeks they stop holding the charge, and when I contact the vendor they honored the guarantee and fast replacement, but after replacing the first two I threw the third on in a drawer about 5months ago and I have been plugging my laptop in. I am sure the same will happen to this battery, and I dont feel like calling and getting it replaced. next time I will but the original equipment for my ibm thinkpad."
5,One of the best TV experiences of all time,"I watched Grand Chef with my whole family. Our three kids (ages 5, 10, 12) all loved it. The story was gripping. Every episode was full of surprises. The cooking sequences were absolutely amazing. Wow, we learned A LOT about Korean food. The acting was wonderful. Just the facial expressions of some of the actors in certain comedic situations were so memorable. We replayed many scenes over and over, enjoying them again and again. We even purchased the musical soundtrack to this series. So many good songs!If you love good stories, good acting, and love learning about new cultures, this TV series is definitely for you. It's a really good time. We are all sad it's over."
5,awesome product,"durable product, great protective covering. it's like a converse shoe protecting your mp3 player."
5,Excellent Product.!,This a master pice from Florsheim... A very confortable shoe with an excellent price..
5,"Excellent, hard-to-find hex bits","I've been looking for these for quite some time: long-shank hex bits that lock into my driver. Hardware stores don't have anything like them for some reason. I got this imperial set along with the 10899 metric set, and they're now my go-to bits. Made in the USA, with ball tips for tough angles, and less than two beans apiece? How can you go wrong. Only complaint is that the smaller bits still have fat shanks, making them difficult to squeeze into tight spaces, and useless for recessed screws. Overall, a no-brainer."
4,"Just the bits, nothing but the bits","These arrived in a small plastic bag with a very generic label. I was a little disappointed that there was no type of index case, like what you'd get with a set of drill bits or most driver bit. Just a bunch of loose bits in a plastic bag. Now I'm going to have to find some way of organizing them in my tool bag..."
1,Not worth the money,The ends of these break off very easily. Especially on the smaller sizes. The larger sizes seem to be ok. I would not purchase them again.
2,Only ballends are in size ranges,"Only the ballends are the sizes in the range for under 1/4"". This means you cannot sink a setscrew underflush as with a T-handle, or L wrench.Its okay for sizes 1/4"" and over."
3,some problems,these work ok for medium duty work .My biggest gripe about them is the smaller sizes once you break the ball off it is unusable because it is 1/4 inch the rest of the way up. I was using them in a 1/4 impact broke 2 or 3 balls off.
2,"Handy, but not very tasty","Apart from the convenience, I can't really recommend them. They don't taste very good. It's much better to eat low-glycemic index sweet foods if you want a sweet and have a place to store such foods."
4,Very cute book!,"I love Charles Reasoner's books and this one is very cute! Although the text is quite basic, my 20 month old enjoys it and already knows each of the phrases (pecking, scratching, bumping, etc.). It's cute! I personally like Who's Bugging You? better and would recommend that book as well."
4,Uruguay The Country From Hell...,"When I first began to look for information on Uruguay, I had a tough time. When I found this book, it was like a gift from God (to learn about a country from Hell). I found out interesting stuff like Uruguay is a great place for livestock farms and most people are so poor that they use horse and buggy or Ford model T's rejected from the U.S. I hate this country but this is a very informative book."
2,Floridaland Ghosts,"This badly-titled book is simply a compilation of ghost stories gleaned from various books and articles to which the author adds nothing. He does not even bother to ensure that the alleged haunted locations still exist. For example, the author claims there is a haunted clock tower on Macomb Street in Tallahassee and even includes a photograph (identified as ""Author's photo""). In fact, the old clock tower was dismantled years ago so the author could not possibly have photographed it. Nevertheless, the book is entertaining to some degree and provides some general information about a few of Florida's better-known haunts."
1,Problem when ordering this item,"Beware: you don't get the color you see! You receive a ""red"" umbrella. There is a problem with ordering this item! Be careful of what you actually place in your cart. If it does not clearly state the color you want, do not order. This is no criticism about the product, only the order process.Wet in Pasadena."
1,piece of ...,"yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro. her husband monsoro is not getting any, how would you feel. this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson, don't buy books you don't know, cause they [are bad]"
5,Crazy and Brilliant!,"This guy is totally nuts and totally wonderful! Radical Honesty is without a doubt the Best ""self-help / personal growth"" book I've ever read. He takes you down deep and says things that aren't supposed to be said but that everyone knows are true. I know some reviewers think Brad Blanton is full of crap - well, OK, but read it again. You may love this book or hate it but Buy It!"
1,Not recommended by my therapist and I can see why,"This was NOT the book for me - but I do really like the author - I've seen him on television and I like his style. However, Radical Honesty is a hodpodge of nothing more than way in which to be rude and insensitive - and I'm being honest! Radical Honesty taught me NOTHING about telling the truth, but plenty about being without an ounce of tact. I expected more from the book and was disappointed. I wished I had read it at the Library instead of purchasing it."
5,Change your life. Read every page of this book.,"I first read Radical Honesty in 1994, reccomended by a close friend of mine. Quite simply, it changed my life and the way I look at people and relationships. And it continues to change my life and the lives of those around me.If you are searching these pages for a compelling reason to buy a ""Self Help"" book, let this be your reason -- Blanton's words will open your eyes up to a world you have only seen from a distance before, in random nights of discussion and odd windows of honesty...It will change you. Brad Blanton says, ""The truth will set you free."" And it will."
2,May contain traces of nuts,"Man o man this is some seriously dangerous stuff. I tried some Radical Honesty at home and my girlfriend threw a ceramic jug at me. `Yes your butt looks big in that', after answering the question reluctantly, under duress led to the chastity belt being firmed-up for a week and a half. I stopped short of admitting that, `yes I want to ram-stein Paula, Natalie etc... like a toey bonobo' which would have prematurely arrested my life. Please read this book with caution unless of course you are married to a supermodel with an equally charmed intellect and a great derrier who cooks like Ferran Adria and for whom it is never nessesary to guild the lily. Note: Blanton has gone through more wedding rings than Zsa Zsa Gabor."
3,Radical honesty is radical and lacking in wisdom,"The author recommends being outwardly honest and tell your wife things such as you fantasize about her sister. And then tell her sister that too. If anything, Radical Honesty will turn your life into a Hollywood hit like Liar! Liar!Blanket statements such as ""always be radically honest"" are always wrong. :-) Life is a little more complex than that.Being radically honest with yourself is a great way to mature but there is no need to tell perfect strangers your relative truth since it will never be ultimate truth or even objective truth.The author's success in therapy with having couples speak their hidden resentments is very effective. But, to generalize it to ""one needs to speak truth everywhere"" is unfounded.The writing lacks clarity and focus. I found myself looking ahead often for chapter endings."
4,Terrific eye-opening book!,"This book has freed me in so many different ways. It is absolutely amazing. Not just because the book teaches about honesty, but more importantly because it teaches how to achieve true happiness in life. This book has also opened my eyes to the fact that most people are unhappy, and try to cover up their unhappiness with lies and ""fronts"" about themselves. This book strips you down to your core, and rebuilds you from an honest center. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to add more enlightenment, creativity, and love in their life. (The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt the author gets a little verbose at times.)"
3,Read _Getting Real_ instead.,"The title doesn't lie: this book is radical, and it is about honesty. It's extreme and provocative, and worth reading -- just keep several large grains of salt on hand. The biggest problem is that IMO Blanton's approach throws sensitivity out the window, equating honesty with completely uncensored - and therefore unconsidered - speech.For a book which shows you how to be honest without being insensitive, read Susan Campbell's excellentGetting Real."
4,Radical Honesty,"To be honest, lol............it was incredible. Live changing. I loved most of what he had to say. I encourage everyone to read it."
2,Buy another book!,"Buy the boook the authorand Neale Donald Walsch wrote together, an interview book instead. How can a book about something ""radical"" be that boring?/Torbjörn JerlerupSweden"
1,Hack of all Hacks,"The author of Radical Honesty is a complete Hack. His credentials rate as sewage water amongst those in therapy, psychology, and psychiatry vocations. He belongs to the school of thought that the more you tear someone down the closer you are to building them up. Does this make sense to you? He suggests that this 'radical honesty' improves relationships but he, himself, has been married several times. If this book doesn't send a relationship on the fritz, nothing else will. Skip this book unless you're a fan of quacks."
5,This book saved a good part of my life.,"At the urging of a friend I read Radical Honesty about 6 years ago. From the strength of the lessons I was able to admit to my failings and dishonesties, and rediscover my center self - honestly. I've since met Dr. Blanton, and have to relate that he is the same in person as he is in prose.If you have stress - if you feel vaguely dissatisfied with life - if you are tired of ""being"" someone that you are not, take the first step to health by reading this book."
1,goes beyond honesty,"I sought out this book based on the title which seemed so noble to me. But the honesty here seemed defined extremely broadly, something more in line with honoring your whims/impulses. By contrast I would like to know something different: how to be honest without hurting people; how to know when the impulses are wise and when they are not.You will wonder why most reviews are more positive than mine: I can only speculate that the excitement of other reviewers comes from others having a strong affinity to his philosophy. I also speculate that many may love the very confident and extremely energetic writing style, but unfortunatly I personally found it overdone, and not nearly as plausible as I would like. At the risk of being too blunt, I am not persuaded that the author has thought carefully about his positions. In any event, you may not agree with my rating, but I think you will agree this book is about something more than or different from honesty."
5,This book rocked my Casbah! Wow! Must read!,"Radical Honesty is a most refreshing antidote to the toxicmountains of self help blather heaped on our bookshelves.Blanton is no holds barred in his recommendations on how tocreate vibrancy in our lives. Whether its telling your momabout the time you stole her car for a midnight jaunt or tellingyour boss what a jerk he is, if this book doesn't enlightenyou it will at least make your life more interesting!Don't read my recommendation. Read this book."
3,do not care for these,"I like the type on a band so they stay on my neck ,but these slide off . have been using them a couple of weeks ,foam has already gotten rather warn and as it gets thinner in jambs deeper into ear . sound protection doesn't seem any better then less expensive ones .not comfortable in my ear ."
2,"1 +1 = 2, 2+2 = 4, etc","What can one say? He writes well, but he can't add. Must've scored 700 on his english SAT and 420 on his math."
1,Conservative humor at its best???,"If this is conservative humor at its best, as Rikas suggests, then it leaves one to wonder what its worst is. Hackneyed and derivative. You'd be better off reading the much better, much funnier P.J. O'Rourke."
1,Shane can't write well,"I give an E for effort, but you gotta take a writing course or at lease be reasonably well read to write a book. I share your conservative mind set and was rooting for the author to succeed - alas, he did not."
5,The Osbournes Season 1 dvd Review,"I'm so happy The Osbournes season 1 is coming to dvd. I've been waiting a while for it to come out since november 19,2002. To top it all off it's uncencerd and at a very low price."
5,The Osbournes NOT intended for children but good,Halarous! that is the only word I would say about the Osbournes.contains Very HEAVY language NOT intended for children. But it is a great reality series can't wait till' season 2. SHARON!
5,The Osbournes Uncut,"As for your previous comments on The Osbournes being uncensored, I believe that MTV America bleeped out all the swearing, but MTV UK have been showing it unbleeped for the best part of 5 weeks now, so it looks very hopeful that it should be like that on the DVD."
5,Amazing!,"Like the other reviewers, I haven't seen this DVD yet because it hasn't even been released, but I'm sure it will be beyond fantastic. 5 stars for the Prince of Darkness!I hope it includes a lot of un-aired footage - and leaves in all of the cursing."
4,hilarious,"I loved the show, and I bought the DVD so I could watch it whenever I wanted. I still think it's funny. If you watch it on DVD, I recommend leaving the ""bleeps"" on (so you can't hear the swearing), because otherwise the show looses much of its charm and cuteness. With the swearing in full-force, it seems much more like a dysfunctional family with way too much money and time on their hands. I only wish I also had the second, third, fourth seasons on DVD, too. But the first season is definitely the best. The bonus features are pretty funny. I recommendthe blooper reel! Pretty funny stuff. Also, the menus on the DVD are really creative and involve the family dogs (not Kelly!) doing some pretty funny stuff."
5,The Lovable Loon!,"I always knew Ozzy was a very funny man, but this new series is a knock me down - falling on the floor - total laugh fest. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD to watch over and over again. We are just getting the show here in Australia on public tv and want the madman to know: ""Ozzy, keep on rockin, and keep on doing what you do, If you haven't seen the Osbournes yet, [...]!"""
1,THIS IS GETTING VERY SAD!!!,I cant believe an artist that I have so deeply admired has sunk so low as to completely sellout in this embarrassing way.I dont place all of the blame on ozzie since sharon is the one who is wearing the pants in the family.This old and terribly greedy woman has made this show only to make more money off of stupid people who would buy this nonsense.Im tired of seeing ozzy act like an old decrepit man who babbles like an idiot.Im tired of seeing their bratty kids cuzz and argue over stupid things.Im tired of seeing their little stupid dogs crap all over the house.Why would any family let the whole world see their private lives?The show is obviously fake and I hope it ends soon.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
5,"Loved it, Buy Season One..","But forget season two!! Season one was Osbourne's at their most honest, before Jack and Kelly decided to let fame go to their head. This was a show about a real family who had the same problems as everyone else in America (Dog Pooping on Carpet, Weird Houseguests, Annoying Neighbors etc) but they were bloody F'in rich! It was so nice to watch a show that could make you laugh so hard it hurt without having a laugh track in the background from some sitcom. I loved the Osbournes first season, it's a classic, but now they're just old hat and in rehab."
1,Will it be showed in closed caption??????,"I really love The Osbournes. The show really made me laugh so hard...and it did hurt my stomach from laughing too hard. Well, that's a good thing!! But one thing really concern me is that will this show be included in closed caption?? It did show in closed caption when it was on the MTV. So, hopefully the DVD will also include in closed caption."
3,Funny....,This I believe was the first real reality show showcasing a celebrity family! It's kinda hard to understand what their all saying but it's funny none the Less!Recommend viewing especially for ozzy fans!!
1,Pile of dookie down a muddy slope.,"This is when Ozzy sold out and became a soft pop flake, great job sharon."
3,Good but...,"I'm a fan of the Osbournes first season and the DVD is decent but there are a number of highly annoying things. First of all, the audio may be uncensored but the video remains censored. You will not see middle fingers extended, Ozzy's [behind], corporate logos, etc. The Ozzy Translator feature is a great idea but poorly executed. I noticed several instances where the translated text was simply wrong or missing words. The translated text includes stupid monochrome graphics that have no value and are distracting, and the offensive words appear in an outlined font that makes them hard to read on screen. The bonus footage is largely unentertaining with the possible exception of the extra Loveline footage. The DVD includes the rather pointless ability to include the audio bleeps while viewing. The DVD ""extras"" are mostly uninteresting. The DVD is great if you want to watch the actual episodes over and over but don't buy this DVD for the ""features."""
3,OK just OK,"I picked up this DVD because I wanted something new for my dvd collection and it [wasn't too expensive]. I have watched the Osbournes before and laughed out loud many times. Ozzy trying to work the remote is my favorite. but this DVD was average. There was nothing really interesting for extras. The extra scenes were boring the interviews were boring and the ""dookie"" game was just ""dookie"". The Commentary track is ok it is done by Jack and Sharon Osbourne plus the other audio tracks allow you to watch the show with the bleeps (funnier in my opinion) Only buy it if you REALLY liked the show ( I didn't) or a big fan of Ozzy (i am not)"
5,Love it!,"I love my foam roller. Helps with stretching and soothing muscles. Amazing product. Wasn't quite sure how to use it at first, but read a book for additional tips. Would give it 6 stars if it included a little manual"
2,Good price but nearly destroyed,"I like the product, having bought it at a local store in the past. Unfortunately package after package in my 12 pack was made up of over half the product in powder form. It got to be a running joke in our household, to the point where I weighed the dust from 2 of the packages. Over 2 oz. of these bags were Soy Crisp powder. I don't think it was a problem of shipping since the box wasn't dented at all and none of the bags had blown open.I ended up using the dust on a salad. The crisps themselves rock - I just wonder if Gensoy has some issues in quality control."
1,Yo Yo Hisotry,This was not a book that truly explains the history or yo yo tricks clearly as I had expected. It wasjust an old photocopy of pages with micro print that seems randomly grouped into a booklet.
3,Less than awe-inspiring,"Seemed like an interesting buy, but basically it's a few dudes who got into climbing up/skiing down mountains, but never really learned how to put together a compelling movie or, for that matter, how to take full advantage of the visual majesty of their setting.Mostly NOT shot in HD, lots of older standard-def footage with some HD mixed in. If you can get it for less than $5, worth a look, but won't end up a permanent part of most peoples' collection."
3,Worth it if you like mountains and skiing,"There are some very good shots of big mountains and some good skiing action. There is a bit too much talking and face time from the climber / skiers but if you like big mountains and skiing, how can you go wrong?"
5,"""Skiing Everest"" is a Documentary That Will Take Your Breath Away","BY BOB BLOOM * JOURNAL & COURIER * NOVEMBER 7, 2010The focus of the movie is high-altitude skiers who climb some of the highest peaks in the world carrying their skis then challenge those slopes, making dangerous descents when they lock on their skis.These athletes challenge their bodies as they refuse to use supplemental oxygen and dare death as they risk all for the ultimate thrill.From Alaska to Tibet, directors Mike Marolt and Les Guthman, follow their small circle of friends and fellow sportsmen as they test themselves by setting higher and higher goals. No stuntmen or special effects can create the thrills that these athletes do by locking in their skis and doing what they love.The documentary proves that despite all the advances in computer technology and other sciences, the planet's majestic creations remain our most wondrous special effects and that men pitting their skills against nature still is the simplest and most"
4,Other issues it didn't address,"They need to update it to include emotional affairs, massage parlors and the web. All of these are very damaging to any relationship. The other factor that was not addressed was financial hardship caused by the sexual addiction and how that would affect the co-dependent if you chose to focus on self only. Although I do understand that a book can not cover all the issues of addiction or co-addiction in this case."
1,"Love, Infidelity, & Sexual Addiction",After reading this book I was very very disappointed. I liked it at first. Then it said I the coaddict was as bad or worse than the sex addict. I find that to be very disturbing.
3,"Good, but narrowly focused","When I first received this book and saw the truly awful graphics on the cover, I began questioning my judgement in ordering it. It looks like something that was produced prior to the computer age.Then I started reading and was, initially, pleasantly surprised. It was well-written and the information was much more research-based than what I had feared finding. But as I kept reading, I realized that this book is not for all codependents of sex addicts.The book is specifically (and, ultimately, only) for those whose partners are: (1) addicted to the emotional aspects of their affairs, (2) unwilling to admit they have a sex addiction, and (3) exceedingly manipulative.For those in that situation, I think this book would be great. But for those of us with a different set of circumstances... not so much."
1,Disappointing,this is more Coltrane than Red Garland -- so get something else if you'd like to hear more of Red's piano. The combo is less than original this time round.
3,"Useful, but disappointing.","The reference text is very complete and detailed. However, when I found that most of the photo plates were black and white, I groaned. What I imagined I'd be receiving was a field guide with a good photo with each entry. As it is you have to flip back and forth from text to plate. A book with photo plates is really ""old school"" these days."
3,Not sure who this book is for,"This book has both high-end theory cryptography theory and practical hacking content for wireless networks. As such I found sections of the book somewhat interesting, and others totally impenetrable. Some sections had straightforward screenshot based walkthroughs, others required knowledge of calculus and circuit design.I can't recommend this book to anyone directly. It's a book that has to be browsed for the content you need, and then the coverage of that content evaluated in person."
3,Wi-Foo: The Secrets of Wireless Hacking,"(I bought this book back in 2009 and I am finally reviewing it)It is a good reference book but not really a must have, considering it was published in 2004, but I guess one can glean some useful information in attacking/defending a wireless network.I'd recommend downloading Backtrack 5 and using the Aircrack-ng suite if one wants to give it a try at cracking wireless networks. WEP is very easy to crack (I have seen phone numbers being used as the key). It irks me that the authors would recommend hiding the SSID and using MAC filtering because it would be ""raising the bar"" for a bunch of script kiddies looking for free Internet. Those two are useless and shouldn't be even considered as adding an extra layer of security as both are revealed when a wireless client connects to an access point. WPA2 (with a complex password of course) is good enough to keep out the average Joe freeloader."
4,Wi-FOO this book is heaven for Network hackers,This book is powerful tool for hackers and those who want to guide against hacking.... its wonderful and it worth each cent.
3,Poor Quality,This DVD teaches the basics. The difference between a good fighter and a great fighter is the good fighter knows the basics and the great fighter knows the basics really well. The only reason I gave this DVD 3 stars is because it was scratched right out of the box and my DVD player had trouble playing it.
1,a poor buy,"This DVD only contains the most basic punches and elbow techniques. It's being falsely advertised with ""discover the secrets of Muay Thai Kickboxing that have never been released to the rest of the world."" while this DVD contains basically what you would learn on your first muay thai lesson, no secrets and no advanced moves or techniques."
1,Very elementry and low production value,This DVD contains very basic of Muay Thai punches and elbows. If you have to be learning this level of fighting on a DVD you probably shouldn't be doing this art. I fast forewarded most of it.
4,"different, lively and entertaining",I found this compilation to be both entertaining and fun. One of the cuts it's ovious that a lot of work didn't go into the production but overall it was great.
4,Tantilizing Possibilities,"While not as entertaining as ""Fingerprints of the Gods"", ""Underworld"" is both interesting and meticulous. You will certainly begin to question what you believe. More than that, you will definately learn something about culture and history. At the very least, reading anything by Hancock will provide you with endless factoids to amaze your friends.Enjoy!"
3,Hancock needs a fearless editor,"This was the first Graham Hancock I have read. Being an avid reader and always searching for valid research for theories I bought this book. It lies unfinished due to repetition of details, conversations with himself and others ver batim. I can slog through details with the best but it was with great exasperation I attempted to stay on track with Mr. Hancock. He is too full of himself. Obviously, he is a great moneymaker because those who should be heavily editing his work are instead worshiping at the feet of the idol. I certainly will not buy anymore of his odes to himself. I have found better answers for my curiosity about underwater discovery of ancient cities by searching website news releases. Fluff and fill is my summary of UNDERWORLD."
1,I wanted it to be a good book . . .,"This is a subject I really love, and a writer I usually enjoy. I just couldn't get into this one. Too much information, too much depth, just a heavy, heavy, exhausting read that should have been an enjoyable book. I usually pass this author's things along to some friends who enjoy his controversial subjects. I won't do that with this one."
3,"Satisfying ending, if you can make it.","It is a tough read because of all the details, and I find that Hancock repeats himself over and over. (I get the point!)If you can perservere there is satisfaction in the end. Hancock is the classic underdog and you really root for him."
2,Way too long!,"I agree with the reviewers who say this book is too long. For example, he goes on for dozens of pages about a controversy about what era a tooth found in cave belongs to. The minutiae of detail can be excruciating . At times you forget what the point of the book is as he trails off into various tangents, such as Indian culture and religion. The thesis of this book is interesting, and certainly worthy of exploration, but this should have been about 200 pages."
2,More noise and less...,"I'm an avid reader and ancient history is my favorite. I like academic writing In general, any written text hardly tires me. I'm finding this book, my first of this author, excruciatingly boring."
4,Graham Dives,"It has long been established that Graham Hancock has a lust for the unusual and ancient; this book, ""Underworld"" fulfills that passion to perfection. Hancock takes the reader on a global hunt for sunken civilizations that were inundated during the melt off of the last great Ice Ace. A melt off, by the way, is still taking place today. Provocative reading and spellbinding. Read this book and glimpse the ancient world as it was twelve to twenty thousand years ago! From India to Cuba and Japan with many stops in between."
1,Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization,"I enjoyed all Hancock's previous books and his premises. But this one is horribly written, badly edited and it rambles, taking several detours then returning to subjects without warning, never thoroughly discussing what is promised. As other reviewers have noticed, this one is frustrating to read. I never got over the feeling he either had an intern write it and didn't check it over or he had a two week deadline. I finished to the end, because I couldn't believe how bad it was. Because Hancock has always obviously bright and intelligent in the past, this book really makes one wonder WHAT WENT WRONG!"
1,Drivel,"These books are nonsense. Any books whose titles include any of the words 'mysterious', 'secrets', 'Templar', 'alien', 'code', 'supernatural', 'mythic', 'cosmic', are just giving away the fact that they are unscientific rubbish. They are based on wishes and dreams, but we should all know that children wish, adults decide."
2,Good fiction,"Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining. But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work. Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses."
3,"Great Hypothesis, Bad Writing","I'll cut to the chase. Graham Hancock's hypothesis that much of our history is now underwater is insightful and logical. Science has proven over and over again that the oceans were once 400 ft lower than they are now. I find no fault with most of his claims and his presentation makes for interesting reading and adds to our general knowledge of ancient history.But would someone please get this man an editor? There is NO reason this book needs to be 700+ pages. He goes into arcane details ad nauseum. The problem is, you want to hear what he has to say so you have no choice but to struggle through all 700+ pages of verbosity. The man is not a writer, as this and his previous books have shown. Perhaps his publishers will wise up and hire him a ghost writer for his next book(s)."
3,Oh sooooo long!,"This book is boring and entertaining all at the same time, so I'll make this review short . The book will give great geological evidence of a great flood that happend some time during the last ice ages. The book is saying that there is evidence that man started civilization long before text book history say's it started, then destroyed, forcing man to start all over. Very interesting is how ancient mythology from all over the world describe a massive flood that wiped out man. One thing for sure the biblical version of the flood wasn't the first. Very interesting book worth reading but be prepared for long read."
4,its still a uptown thang,"UNLV aint dead, ya herwuds me its still a uptown thang for life. If ya liked ""Uptown 4 Life"" then go on out dhere and copo that sequel, ""Trendsettas"" featuring the hotttt retaliation of dragem from da river, Yallas revenge. Its the one , its how cash money used to be and should be."
1,Navman 520,"The unit started to send error messages when I was loading the state maps off of the CDs. All data was lost (I spent several hours loading the data at that point), and then it wouldn't take any data off of the CDs at all. I ordered a different brand, and am much happier with it."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I have owned this GPS for 2 month.This GPS takes very long time to load and transfer maps from a CD. One hour to transfer 250 MB. total 2 GB of map data for North America.Map are outdated.Sometimes the voice instruction are confusing. The map on the screen showing that you should turn right, but the voice will tell you ""keep left"". I got into the wrong lane and missed the turn because of that.The routing calculation algorithm is not smart. the computer does not know which road or street is less traffic nor quicker. Mostly, the GPS will show you the rout which has less turns and stay on the main road. Indeed, there is a short cut which is faster and shorter."
1,My iCN 510 only work for 13 months.,I spent $544 bought a Navman iCN 510 last year in June. It only works for about 13 months. The memory card stops working. I called the tech support; they told me that it passed one-year warranty. I have to spend $150+ to ship it back and get it repaired. I can't believe this thing can really find a good time to die! At least this company is good at making it's GPS last till the warranty passes.
2,Navman iCN520 GPS is no good,"This device is a piece of trash. Don't waste your money buying it. The address database for the USA 2005 maps that were bundled on the enclosed CDs is missing a lot of addresses. I tried looking up my street address so that I could get directions from a friend's house to my place and my address was not included in the database!Anything made by Garmin, the CS32X series is way better than this sorry excuse for a GPS. For the technically inclined, this GPS is actually is a PocketPc modified so that it works as a GPS. Yes! It's partially a Microsoft product after all! LOLAMERICA, SPEND YOUR MONEY WISELY !!! DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH !!!"
5,The coolest gps in the market.,"I have used so many gps receivers since 98 starting from Garmin 12 and Delorme Earthmate interfaced with laptops and pdas, and also with bluetooth gps receiver. Then I just got the Magellan roadmate 800 a month ago. That thing was cool but bulky. Got some info on net how to hack it and able to play divx, overclock from 300mhz to 500mhz. But when I saw the iCN 520 on sale for $199 with free shipping, I could not resist a good deal like that and I bought one...Here is the list of features of iCN520 that i like:Smaller and lighter with same screen size 3.5"",Zooming and scrolling over the map is faster.Someone complained about glare, maybe, but I adjusted my map color to white background and I had no problem to see directions. The small speaker distorts and sound metalic but I can live with that.I also found info how to hack it and I can use as pda without block recognizer, divx, mp3 player, scientific calculator,...Overall I found iCN 520 a cute and useful gadget."
4,"Nice, Quiet Cockburn Classic",One of Bruce Cockburn's most mellow CDs. Also one of his most beautiful in terms of melodies. High Winds White Sky is quite a good song as is Let Us Go Laughing. I remember listening to this song with my wife (when she was my girlfriend) and she was hooked right away. One Day I Walk may go down as one of Cockburn's most beautiful songs ever. Very good CD for a cold winter day while you are relaxing on the couch in front of the fireplace.
3,good,Once again. Some very good songs but with some remakes which do not warrant the space on the cd. Sister Golden Hair comes to mind.
1,Total disaster,"If this is anything like Check Designer, stay away. My experience was that the program is incompatible with Quicken's updates, and needs a new patch every time Quicken revises . . .until the latest Quicken update, to which Check Designer is permanently incompatible with. Their tech support responded only by emails and only on a 24-hour turnaround (so don't be in a hurry to fix bugs), then they send you one goose chase after another, but none makes it work. And then they refuse to t refund the price because it's after a mere 30 days from purchase. . . but we've been emailing for 30 days alone. That's my last purchse from Avanquest."
1,Checksoft 2005 Home & Business,"The program was okay for my purposes except it is not possible to split catagories, so I purchased Quicken Deluxe 2005 to use with the check writing feature. Quicken did an update soon afterward. Checksoft was no longer compatible and I could not print the checks. My emails received no response. I am not about to purchase new versions of Checksoft every time Quicken updates. I have resorted to using Checksoft's program for printing a check and then registering again in Quicken. It is a hassle and a time-eater!!"
5,The Right Spoon,"if you search a big spoon, it's a perfect match when you desire. and the material is a very soft and comfortable."
5,johnny rivers summer rain,"Excellent CD,not one bad song on it.Great flashback to the 60's & 70's scene.Highly recommend for any age group."
5,CD Johnny Rivers Summer Rains,I so enjoyed this CD! A perfect selection of his greatest hits. I've listened to it over and over. I had not heard his songs in a long time and it was a nice memory.
4,A Classic in the field,"If you study criminal justice or homeland security, you likely know all about Problem-oriented Policing. This book is by the man who coined the term originally, and is an absolute great read. It's worthy of textbook status, though I personally read it just for personal enlightenment. I encourage anyone with an interest in the field to give it a read, you won't regret it."
4,Please find more tape of these guys,"What can one say about Cook and Moore? They were supremely funny. The only reason I didn't give this dvd the additional star is, they cut off C&M's most famous skit. One Leg Too Few (which appears in the short doc about the two of them). Would have liked to see the entre sketch. That's a quibble though in this age of You Tube. Enjoy this disc. It's marvelous to see these boys again and to see Dud play the piano! Man, he swung. Great disc all around."
1,The Best Of,"Kinda silly and slapstick. I guess I kinda expected the other side of British humor from Cook & Moore, more like Beyound The Fringe"
4,MAIN REASON TO GET THIS SET = RUTHIE HENSHALL,"This is a compilation cd with excellent performances compiled from some of London's best recordings. There are also new recordings as well. Namely from London's star, Ruthie Henshall.""Don't Cry For Me Argentina""- Henshall""I Don't Know How To Love Him"" - Henshall""All That Jazz"" - Henshall""The Perfect Year (Sunset Blvd)"" - Henshall""Send in the Clowns"" - Henshall""My Favorite Things"" - HenshallOtherwise the 2cd set is a great compilation cd."
2,"Poor customer service, product defective","I wouldn't buy anything from this company. They have the worst customer service I have ever seen. I got the product working (despite the unbelieveably poor documentation), but the output on my monitor showed ghosting and poor image quality. I called them and after waiting almost an hour on hold they said ""swap the cables and call us back"". At least that's what I think he said --- he barely spoke English. I tried their recommendation and it made no difference. Called them back and they said the product was defective after asking me 8 or 9 completely rediculous questions. Said I should ship it back to them (at MY cost) and they would ship me a new one in ""a few weeks""! I told them I didn't think that was a very good policy (I'd only had the product 2 days), and that if that was their policy I wouldn't buy their products. They said ""Your Choice, goodbye"". That was it. Well I DO have a choice and you do too!"
1,Poor Quality,"Product was missing AC adapter...couldn't even plug it in. After hassling with it and trying to rummage around to find an AC adapter to work with it, I gave up and packaged it up and returned it. Instructions and documentation are horrible. Would not recommend this product."
3,"Good, not great","There are too many easy questions, many errors, and the explanations to the answers tell you little more than the obvious. For the price, it's not a bad way to get a bunch of questions though."
4,new gladiators,"The New Gladiators is a excellent look at the marital arts scene from back in the 70""s. As a long standing martial artist i throughly enjoyed it.But i did feel it was wrong to not have footage of Elvis Presley praticeing Kempo Karate, especialy since this documentary originated as his own project.......Skip.A"
3,New Gladiators,This DVD is a collectors item & a must-have for those interested in the formative years in American karate. But the DVD froze in the same spot each time I tried to watch it (even after a wipe-down w/ a soft cloth). I only saw half.How do I get an exchange so I can write a complete review?
3,"Good soloists and cool arrangements, but..","Freddie Hubbard guests on some of the tracks here, and each of his solos betrays his extremely weakend chops. He consistently strives for notes which he cannot reach, or cannot reach without sounding extremely strained. Indeed, his presence lends a certain nervous quality to a lot of these tracks. He does have his moments, as always, though. Lew Tabackin has quite a few moments, sounding better and more probing than on many of the original albums Akiyoshi's band released in the 70s. The ""Kourakan Suite"" is definitely an extended piece with many merits, and some of the other tunes are very catchy in a way only Toshiko's tunes are."
5,Works good on my 2011 Wrangler,"I bought this for my '11 Jeep Wrangler. It fits perfectly. I followed some tutorials on the Jeep Forums and it was pretty straight forward. Took about 30 mins to install. You need a couple of quick splices (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030CQMW). I put one horn in the exiting location and put the other on a bolt behind the washer reservoir.The sound is much better (deeper and louder) than the squeaky stock horn. Just waiting for someone to cut me off, so that I can use this for real!"
4,So far so good.,"I changed a set of WOLO's out for these and have to say these are more of an attentiongetter than the WOLO's were. I like these horns so far. I just mounted them todayso I have hardly any street experience with them as of yet, but from what I heardin my carport, they should handle ""obstructions"" very well.Not as loud as an compressed air horn, but pretty darn loud from what I can tell.I'm glad I bought the lower freq horns rather that the higher freq set as I feelthe lower has the better sound pitch for my tastes.And yes two horns plus two 18 gauge grounding wires with connectors as well asinstructions came in the PIAA package. Once again very happy with Amazon for thequick and well packed shipment."
4,"Very loud, low power consumption","I compared these horns to the stock 1999 Miata meep-meep horn and measured the following results:Stock horn: 105dB, 2.5AFIAMM El Grande: 110dB, 4.7A/6.1A = 10.8A current draw, $20PIAA 85110: 112dB, 3.9A/3.0A = 6.9A current draw, $45Stebel Nautilus: 112dB, unknown current draw, $50Hella dual trumpet 007424804: 110dB, 4.0A/3.8A = 7.8A current draw, $24For my $$ they take quite a bit less current than any of their competitors and are just as loud as the unreliable Stebel air horns. I haven't checked the Hella Supertones, which are supposed to be louder than these. But they have a nice attention-grabbing but still pleasant sound and aren't too expensive."
4,Great Car Horn,"It has a good sound to it, and was fairly easy to install. I gave it 4 stars because it was only slightly louder than my stock horn, and i thought i would be even louder, also didn't come with mounting hardware (nuts and bolts)"
1,"Horrible Product, Look Elsewhere","I bought these horns to replace the wimpy horn on a Subaru Legacy. The high tone unit never worked out of the box, DOA. The lower tone, the one I really wanted, worked for two days then stopped working. Big waste of time and money, especially considering the Wolo horn that I got to work no problem, procured from the local auto parts store for 1/3 the price of this pair! Prospective buyers beware!!!"
3,Good replacemnt but not as loud as expected.,"I really thought this PIAA horn combo would really have attitude. Sadly these do not. The youtube sound clips are deceiving at best. I gave this horn combo a 3 star rating bc they have a very clear high low tone sound to them. If you are merely looking to replace the factory horns, then these will do it. You`ll probably find less expensive horns than these that would suffice in that case. If you are looking for louder horns, then do yourself a favor and continue searching."
4,Nice book for dog lovers,This book is more for a dog lover than garden lover. Was hoping to get some ideas for a dog yard so was a little disappointed in it. Does have nice photos of dogs though. The gardens could be better.
5,Close to Perfect,"This book is very well done, it is touching, interesting and uses vivid language. Although it's easy to read, it manages to sustain a deep plot with thrilling adventure. I'd reccomend this book to all readers, both young and old. K.M Peyton's A Midsummer Night's Death is a great book."
4,For all who like excitement and tension,"Review ""A Midsummer Night's Death""The novel ""A Midsummer Night's Death"" written by K. M. Peyton isabout the student Jonathan Meredith who has to realize how involvedhe is in the death of his English teacher Mr. Robinson.The structure of the book is very dramatic and the reader recognizesa rising action. To me, it was quite exciting to read the bookalthough I do not prefer that kind of literature.The more you read, the more you are interested in finding out whatthe teacher's death is about.So I can recommend ""A Midsummer Night's Death"" to those who likereading novels full of excitement and tension."
5,Good product,Bought it for my son works great.Fast delivery very happy with purchase.I dont feel li ke writing so much but they wanted more words haha
3,Slip sliding Away !,"I was not impressed with the poor directions that came with this shoulder rest. Furthermore, it tends to slide off the instrument much more easily than I expected. My daughter is still using it, but I expected a better product; I suppose it is a better deal and less expensive than the fabric slip-on Shoulder rests that cost 35.00 !"
5,Fast Shipping,Book was delivered exactly as described in new condition. Very fast shipping. Would recommend seller!
3,Very Generic,"This Video was very generic. It was a very ""how to change a furnace filter"" type of video.I was expecting more."
1,These really do NOT sprout,"I should have believed the other reviewer who wrote that these do not sprout. I was naive enough to think that I can 'make them' sprout. They do not, no matter what you do with them."
1,These sprouting oats don't sprout!,"If you are looking into buying these to sprout, don't bother. They don't sprout. I have no idea what the reason is, maybe they were old, but for three days my other grains spouted really well (buckwheat, sunflower seeds) while these have not sprouted even a single grain!"
2,didn't care for these,"I put these in dirt for my cats and they got moldy so I tried them in my Sproutman sprouter and all they did was ferment no matter what I did. So might be me but I wont be buying these again. Also, I do have an issue with no protected seal on the product."
5,A Cute Cosmic Compendium,"This modest little trade paperback is a collection of Oberg's articles on space flight subjects from the early 1980s, and half of it is a supplement to his better-known book 'Red Star in Orbit'.The contents in more detail are: Foreword by Ben Bova; Invisible Space Race; Spaceflight Fire; Astronauts versus Robots; Spaceflight Geography Lesson; Space Fleets; Space Maladies; Salyut-7 Breakthroughs; Soyuz T-8 Rendezvous; Modules in Orbit; Drama of Soyuz T-10A; Russia's Space Shuttle Programs; A Shuttle-Salyut Joint Mission; Soviet Propaganda Blitz; 24-Hour Astronaut Service; Flights to Other Worlds; Exploring the Asteroid Belt; Spaceships of the Future; Tethered Space Operations; Space Pilgrim's Progress; index. (...)"
4,"A good book, but the author has another that's better.","This is certainly a good book. Clear and amply illustrated in an expressive style of painting. The contents of this book and four others (oils, acrylics, watercolors, portraits) are contained together in the author's massive book:The Complete Painting Course: A Guide to Techniques in Oils, Watercolors and AcrylicsThe Complete Painting Course: A Guide to Techniques in Oils, Watercolors and Acrylics. If I were to recommend a single purchase for the beginning painter, it would be the more comprehensive edition."
2,Misleading,"THis is a tiny little book with a few enlightening quotations (some even from the bible)with a brief description and photos for some specific yoga asanas (positions). I honestly didn't find this very helpful. Its 4 inch by 4 inch ring binder format should cost $4, not $10+. You'll get more out of the fat free video called ""Fat Free Yoga by Ravi Singh"". Amazon does not carry this video, but you can find it easily if you do a search on msn."
3,"It's A HOUSTON, TX Thang... I Guess.","I guess it's a Houston,TX thang. But who knows, it could be the start of something big. I'll give it another chance. Congratulations on making your dream a reality!!! Maybe you can give more shout-outs to The BOOT (LA) on your next album."
1,Worthless,i bought this tape hoping to get some real fresh new insight on muay thai. but all it shows is a bunch of sloppy amateurs executing their sloppy techniques. a total waste of money and time. if you want a real muay thai video go to panther productions.
1,More of the same from Tape #1,"I have trained at a real Muay Thai camp and have to say that Master K is not exactly what I would call a household name in Thailand. In fact, he is pretty much unknown. That does not make him a bad teacher, though. What I was not impressed by was the athletic ability and the shape his students that he used to demonstrate the different techniques. Most of them were slow, sloppy, and looked incredibly amateurish. To me, that speaks volumes about the quality of the instructor. The video quality as well was very poor. It looked like someone took video from their Camcorder and then ran it through their VHS and voila! I would recommend going to a camp in Thailand or Fairtex here in the U.S. if you are really serious about Muay Thai."
5,This Bass is just AWESOME,"Wow. Where to start....This bass is not your average Dean Edge bass. The Bartolini pickups make this bass shine. The bolt on neck is thin and fast. Finish is beautiful. I really have nothing bad to say about this bass. A bass that sounds this good at this price point is a no brainer. I replace the factory strings with D'Addario Chromes Flatwounds and it just sounds beautiful. At times you can get great deals on these basses, but even at 500.00 its sounds great."
2,Zzzz....,"By page forty I had lost all interest in ""Nick"" and decided not to follow him on his trip. ""Slow and drab"" describe the well built atmosphere Pelecanos offers. The texture is there, but it lacks color and contrast. Nick himself is a dreary loser with few redeeming qualities, and the supporting characters offer no help. A snooze."
3,Not His Best,"I am a fan of Pelecanos' novels. He is one of the best mystery writers around. His stories are character driven, well written, and full of atmosphere. So what's wrong with Nick's Trip? There's too much trip. We spend too much time driving around and drinking and slumming in sleazy bars. Now in real life that's fun, but in the novel it eventually gets boring. One scene reminds us of another, one bar smells like another, one morning-after feels like another, and eventually we beg Pelecanos to stop the car and let us out. Nick's Trip is a good novel, better than a lot of other mystery novels out there, but it's not Pelecanos' best."
4,A good (not great) read,"Nick's trip is a well written but structurally flawed piece of work. Mr. Pelecanos has a real gift for creating characters and displays it well here. My only gripe is that he fails in trying to keep 3 story lines going simultaneously. Instead of each story successfully reflecting and adding to the others to build a stronger whole, the book winds up feeling slightly disjointed and episodic. Despite this caveat it is definitely worth reading."
5,I love his books,I have read almost all of his books and really like them. I'm looking forward to all his new books.
2,Featuring drawings by a person that can't draw,"I read the glowing reviews, I wanted the book as a guide to costume through the ages, I got the book, and I took it back (purchased from Barnes & Noble instead of Amazon, for reasons that are irrelevant; I am an Amazon book-buyer of 12+ years standing, however).One fact that reviewers neglected to mention, which to me is very important in a mostly visual, image-laden book, is that the illustrator (who is also the author) is a terrible artist. He can depict the clothes well enough, I suppose, but the figures on which he drapes them are awful. He has chosen a preternaturally clunky broad shape for arms, and even legs; and the faces look like bad vintage dolls at best, and misshapen abused dolls at worst. This distorted, unnaturalistic representation is *highly* distracting, and makes nearly all the pictures unpleasant to look at."
4,Hard to review....,I can say that the quality of the product seems to be really good. I am not sure how long they last. The ones that came originally on my vacuum lasted me for about a year. I use the vacuum for my pellet stove. I don't like the idea of not being able to wash them and use them again.
1,please be careful,"Linked by amazon to Northern tool for this product I found that you do not get the clamps as pictured. Upon calling Horthern Tool I was told to send the filters back as they must be packed short. 10 days later I received a replacement filter set and still did not receive any clamps. Calling Northern Tool again, and having another conversation, I was told they would have to get a vendor response to this issue. That was 2 months ago. No word from anyone. Fourty dollars later I feel I have been totally screwed."
3,false picture,"The picture of this item shows that the clamps are included. They are not. However, the discription of the product at the bottom of the page does say that the package contains only the filters. To me, this is false advertising. It makes me wonder if I should buy from Amazon.com."
5,Good Idea,"Its a good idea to have a spare set of filters on hand for quick and easy replacement when the need arises.This is a good product and this experience,like all of my others,was quick,easy,and accurately described."
1,Very disappointed,"I read the previous reviews and decided to purchase this video. I had expected more of a fitness/exercise video. The self defense aspect was good, however, the title is very misleading. There is no way that this video would get anyone fit. Also, the first several minutes was just talking, so the content only ends up lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. I do not recommend purchasing this video."
1,Obsolete -- old 16-bit version of VC++,"This book is obsolete. This book focuses on Visual C++ version 1.5 (16 bit version of Visual C++ that Microsoft no longer supports). While a lot of the information on MFC is still relevant, the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit is a tedious one."
2,Less fiber than the regular Glucerna and more expensive,"Ordinary Glucerna, which can be purchased at WalMart, Costco, grocery stores, and drug stores, has 5 grams fiber in an 8 oz. bottle. This Glucerna is billed as ""specialized nutrition with fiber"" but has 3.4 grams of fiber in an 8 oz. can. It also costs significantly more. I will NOT be ordering this product again!"
4,The new Author keeps getting better...,"Jim Mullaney keeps on improving the series. Second in a four part mini-series, we have plenty of action, a set-up for the next book, and no stupid character mistakes that plagued the books a few issues back."
3,truck tool box,"This was delivered ups, after installing on my truck one could see a dent on the cover, but reteun policy looked difficult, but the box functions ok. After going back and looking at other reviews I saw similiar cases. I assume that either the packaging of the aluminum diamong plate tool box is inadequate or this is how the company is getting rid of their scracth and dent products"
3,Unsatisfactory Packing,"The unit arrived with small dents and one corner bent. Packed only in a single sheet of cardboard. If you need one buy it at a store where you can check it first. I needed the unit when it arrived, otherwise I would have refused it."
1,Shame on you Alpine!,"I would like to reinforce the others comments as well as put in a few of my own. Unit is completely unreliable. Interface with the head unit is awkward and does not give you caller id when someone calls. Cant tell you how many times I answered the phone and didnt want to talk to that person. Music does stream through the unit but sounds HORRIBLE. Worse than a tape player. Simple, until they get it right STAY AWAY and dont waste your money. Come on Alpine, this one is really hurting your rep."
1,worst Alpine product,"Doesn't have voice recognition, doesn't have caller ID, too much money for nothing..... sorry Alpine"
3,The Widowing of Mra. Holroyd,I bought this movie because I love Collin Firth. I did not enjoy this movie at all. It was too dark for me.
2,Not a favorite with me,"The story is depressing and Colin Firth doesn't have a very big role in it and that is why I purchased it. The acting was good, though."
2,"More like a ""Boring"" play",It was a good story but the way it was filmed didn't do it justice. I found it very slow and there was hardly any scereny. Everything was filmed mostly in the house (which was very small and dark). If you like plays then you might like this movie. But I was very disapointed with it. I didn't feel any romance in this film. But like I said before it had a very good story to it. But it just seemed to drag on.
1,Boring movie.,"Receipt of DVD was prompt and delivered in the condition promised, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. What a waste of performers like Zoe Wanamaker and Colin Firth. Even though written by D. H Lawrence, it fails miserably in entertainment value."
1,The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd,"Sorry folks, I LOVE Colin Firth, but this was one of the worst storylines I've ever seen him in... Quite depressing, actually... (sorry)"
2,Not worth buying,"I wasn't familiar with this story prior to watching it but I didn't care for it. I thought it ended abruptly. This is a very stripped-down, non-glossy, typical BBC 80s production, so expect some lighting and audio problems. Not worth buying."
1,VERY disappointed,i was very disappointed in the quality of this production. i don't remember reading that it was a play and not a movie format. the sound quality was awful as actors moved away from the microphones. it was poor quality from the gitgo. I am sorry i purchased this.
5,jt part 2,"This young man is very reminiscent of Johnny Taylor's youngerdays. The best blues,soul,downright hole in the wall music that is out right now. The young man(27 is here to stay! PS. RIP Johnny!"
5,Is there anybody lonley,"Hi i had never heard of Sir Charles Jones until a friend of mine told me about him. And he talked about this song, is there anybody lonely and he went on and on how much he love this song so when i went to visit him he played it for me and i have listen to it and told alot of people about it and they love it. His whole cd is off the hook i love it and to be so young it is great. HEY SIR. CHARLES JONE KEEP LETTING GOD BLESS YOU WITH THESE SONGS BECAUSE ALOT OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE. THANK YOU."
1,Play once throw away,"I bought Chicken Shoot 1 for the PC and it was terrible, fun for 5 minutes. The game had only one screen and did not progress... When I saw this one for the GBA I read the product features and it said ""Takes you through Forest, villages, deserts,and mountains. And even said something about play english 8 ball, US 8 ball, 9 ball & killer. Well I've played it a dozen times and all I have found is 2 screens. No 8 or 9 ball nothing. It's just as boring as the first one save your money and buy ANYTHING except this game."
5,Worth its' weight in gold!,"If all you read is his explanation of how important excellent penetration is to the game of blackjack then this book is worth ten times what you'll pay for it! The book is quite entertaining as well. His ""best act I've ever seen"" is fantastic. If you want to become an excellent blackjack player you can do so by reading a few books-this is clearly one of them!"
4,Best Office 2000,"The presentation is easy to read and follow, even for a novice. Contains helpful hints and superior graphics to illustrate the processes."
4,A college beginner's SQC textbook,"This is a typical college text book which serves very well on the subject,SQC. It has provided a good coverage on SQC, in particular, as an introductory text. Each SQC subject is treated well from a newcomer perspective. If you're a beginner in the college education and looking for a book on this subject, this is IT!"
5,Fabulous Acrobat Book,"Finally a complete book on Acrobat. Don't even waste your money on the Adobe Classroom book on Acrobat. Really expensive and useless. You won't have a clue of what Acrobat really is used for after looking through that. This how to book is somple to read, written in an easy, engaging manner, and gets down to the facts quickly. I woulld highly recommend this one. Thanks to the author for FINALLY writing a comprehansive book on a subject that really needed one"
3,Excited to receive -- Disappointed after reading!,"I purchased this book because of the great reviews it received. Wow, what a disappointment! I agree that it is written well and easy to understand, but it is a far cry from learning EVERYTHING about Acrobat 5.0! I am a beginning user so I did learn many things I did not know before, but it tires me when authors waste over 200 pages discussing past versions, especially when one of those is Acrobat READER (the free program). ""EVERYTHING"" does not mean mentioning a feature or function of the subject program, then referring the reader to yet another book to find out HOW to use the feature. Maybe using the 200 pages for this purpose would have been much better."
3,Nice container,"Let me start off with, I gave this product 3 stars because I didn't receive the container pictured. I ordered this product specifically because I wanted the container depicted in the picture (divided container on the bottom; separate, and larger, container on top). What I got was a Rubbermaid 6-cup divided 'dinner plate'. One large section (3 cups or so) and two smaller sections (about 1.5 cups each).The container itself is excellent and well worth the price. I've seen it in Walmart and other stores for more. Since it's Rubbermaid, you know you're getting a good product.I was just disappointed that I didn't get the product I was expecting."
4,Picture wasn't true to size,It looks smaller than it is. Good product though if there were a more accurate pic and description.
1,RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Don't buy this item. They sell these same plates for $4.00 at Wal-Mart. Don't let Amazon rip you off like they ripped me off.
1,hate,I couldn't even get through the first frame of the movie.I just couldn't get over the part about giving her dog a blow.
1,not for that price!,all this book does is explain the rules. it might be rare (?) but in my expert opionion it is no way worth more than a couple of dollars. the seller should be ashamed.
1,If you like mini's,"It might be just me - but I certainly expected more than an a 3in. ""toy"" for this price. Looks like something you would get in a cracker jack box.And there's nothing ""plush"" about it either! Very disappointing!"
1,Bobby Darin Singing at his Best,"I was very disappointed with dvd, it was in black and white and was not endorsed nor authorized by the estate of Bobby Darin.I have Bobby Darin Aces back to Back and Bobby Darin Beyond the Sea,Bobby Darin Mack is Back, this Singing at his Best, does not compared to the ones listed above.Shirley Hildreth"
3,Great nostalgia; okay video quality,"I was a kid when Darin was big, but my folks loved him and he and his style got into my system. This was purchased for mere joy for my husband and I. It's okay. I mean, it was a thrill to see him and watch his 'show' clips, it's just that the quality is a little less than I hoped. It's still worth the price though...I mean genuinely, it's a classic viewing and worth the ownership. We've watched this DVD quite a few times already, shared it with friends and overall we alway smile throughout and are glad to have a chunk of entertainment history revisited!"
1,A Disappointment,"The audio was of poor quality. Many of the scenes were seen on the DVD ""Bobby Darin-Mack is Back"""
5,Excellent Small Camera,"This camera fits the bill perfectly if you are looking for a small camera with a great optical zoom and easy to use features. Plus it has a huge screen to view your pictures. Only thing lacking is a viewfinder, which you would seldom use anyway. It takes nice clear photos and easily fits into your pocket. The best feature is the 5x zoom which is most powerful in this size camera that I could find. I highly recommend this camera."
4,"Great camera that I've used for 4 years, and it's still great!","I bought this camera new for $125 in early 2007, now almost 4 years ago. It takes nice videos that I've made family DVD's from. It has enough features for a novice to take nice snapshots. My husband left this camera behind on a trip to Israel, and I liked it enough to buy a refurbished one to replace it. I tried 2 other cameras in the meantime and hated them. Despite the odds, I got my original one back and was happy to share the refurbished one with a family member who is also really happy with their F650. I do have occasional zoom errors that I fix by pointing the camera at the ground while zooming it in and out to dislodge the debris that is typically the cause. I do keep my camera attached to a zippered case so that there's less likelihood of damage."
4,Great all around camera,"The great 5x optical zoom makes this camera an awesome buy. The picture clarity is great. The 5x lens makes this camera a little bit bigger than other compact cameras, but it is a great balance between convenience and picture quality. The only downside is the battery life. I am planning on buying a second battery for those long days at Disney with the kids."
1,THEY LIED!!,THEY SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO GET A CAMERA AND THEY SENT ME A WATERPROOF CAMERA CASE!! I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN!!
2,Flat at Best,Do not recommend at all. Flat characters with a completely predictable plot and simplistic writing style. This author has done much better.
2,Disappointing,"Based on the interesting plot description and my enjoyment of Ms. Roll's A Compromised Lady and His Lady Mistress, I decided to purchase this novel. The beginning was drawn out and the conflict was quickly extinguished. The plot crawls forward at a snails and the antagonist is barely a participant in the story. This book was a disappointment for me, however I do recommend A Compromised Lady and His Lady Mistress."
1,Couldn't finish it,"Unfortunately I did not like this book, although I had read a different one of hers and enjoyed it quite a bit (His Lady Mistress). Maybe this one was one of her earlier ones, before her writing became more polished? I thought it was simplistic and juvenile, the dialogue was trite, and the scenario was not believable. The use of exclamation points was very annoying. After reading some of the more positive reviews I gave it another try, but just could not get past the simplistic writing. It does give me hope that one day, too, I can be a published author!"
4,Rolls is on a Roll,"This was a delightful read and the third Elizabeth Rolls novel I have read. (The others were: A Compromised Lady and His Lady Mistress.) All three have rated 4 stars on my rating scale. I read for pleasure and am not a typical ""guy"" because I love romance novels. Oddly enough, graphic sex scenes turn me off because they trivialize a very sacred act. Really great romance authors have the skill to convey the message without resorting to such vulgar tactics. Though Ms, Rolls use of such scenes was minimal, the inclusion cost the 5 star rating on my scale.Her characters were bigger than life and the plot was a little unusual but well developed and executed. My most significant criticism was at the end when a blow to the head reversed the heroine's disability. Her disability was a major reason for the depth of character she displayed. It seemed a shame to take it away.I award Ms. Roll a very weak 4 stars for this work."
2,child didn't like,"My daughters ages 4 and 9 own this dvd and don't like it. They also own the billy blanks tae bo for kids and love it. My 9 yr. old especially likes the tae bo better. I bought this thinking that it would give them another kind of workout, but they don't want to do this one at all. I thought they would, and I'm sure as the other reviews have stated, love it but they didn't. I guess it just depends on the child."
1,No so great,"This video was not what I was looking for at all. I have a 3 & 5 yr old and they were not interested in this video. It seemed to me the video is talking to the adults and not targeted to the children. It was not fun or exciting at all. For the money, I would advise to find another video."
3,Mom thought it was great,"I loved this for my son, but he didn't get into it. The instructor is great, very engaging. If he were live in person, kids would love him."
5,Excellent exercise DVD,"I bought this mainly for my 7 yr old son, but even the older children I care for (I run a family daycare) really enjoy this. All the kids give it two thumbs way up."
1,Must be kidding me..,"This is the MOST BORING DVD I have ever seen in my entire life. No one can expect a good workout from this nonsense. I understand that this is geared toward kids, but, don't we want them to get SOMETHING out of it? This is S L O W and boring. The instructor is boring, the music is boring, the kids are boring, and not in sync. I bought this for my daughter and she HATES it. Even my four yr old hates this, I hate this. Save yr money."
4,good choice for when you can't go outside,"My 9-1/2 year old daughter likes the "" self defense moves"" the instructor does. She said it also has ""good exercise moves"". I enjoy doing it with her. It helps me get some exercise and we are spending quality time together....really helps on those cold winter days when we can not go outside."
5,my daughter likes it,"I bought this Dvd for my 9 year old daughter. She is very active and in the winter time I wanted something to keep her active between soccer seasons (even though she is doing some basketball)-- like I said, she likes to be active. When I first got this dvd, she had a cast on her foot and then progressed to a brace but she was able to do parts of the workout even with those limitations. She is thrilled now that she can do all of it without limitations. She and a friend have done the workout together as well and had fun. The instructor has a lot of fun with the kids and it is very age appropriate for the tween years."
5,As Great as the Reviews - if not Better,"This video was really, really good. It was just as good as the reviews I had read, if not better. Sometimes the reviews are very biased and it is hard to tell if the people writing the reviews are being honest. Well, listen to me when I say - the reviews for this video are RIGHT ON! Just about everything other people have said about this video is true. Rich is amazing with the kids, and the kids response to his upbeat personality is what really makes this video. Also, the movements are very unique, different from most videos I've seen, and the movements are also very easy to follow, but still challenging enough to get a good workout in. I highly recommend this video."
4,worth it,"my 8 year old daughter loves it, I do it with her too. Sometimes she even plays it twice! The 'names' he gives the moves are fun too, she says it's fun being healthy"
4,Pretty Good,"I really like the exercises on this video. They are explained well for children of all ages. I have a 3 & 4 year old who do it. They like it. The guy is a little sarcastic. He tries to joke with the kids, but it is a little too forced and scripted. He rubs me wrong, but it is a well put together work out."
3,Great if they use it.,Purchased for child age 12 has used it 3 times it is easy to use but it is a lot of work.
5,TERRIFIC VIDEO - My kids are hooked,"This is one terrific video, my kids are hooked. I have never seen anything like this before, it is fun, exciting, and even challenging enough to give my 13 year old a good workout.I LOVE IT & MY KIDS LOVE IT. This was a very good buy!"
3,it's huuuge!,"well, it's huge. the fact that you can order a strap to convert it into a purse tells you so. i ordered one and i returned it the same day. i guess if you normally use a day planner or something, it would just replace that, but doesn't that defeat the purpose of the little tiny palm v/vx?it does look like it is sturdy and of good craftsmenship, hence the 3 stars..."
4,"The PalmVx changed my life, and it just got better!","OK, so saying a piece of equipment made my life better immediately makes me sound like some sort of 'sad' person. WELL....I've got 9month old twins, a three year old, a husband(!), a Dad starting his own business, currently renovating our home, plans to build a new one, a hectic 12-hours-a-day job PLUS 37 new books still outstanding.... AND....believe me, this little piece of metal brings some sanity (and fun) to all of this. When I bought the deluxe carrycase, my cheque book, cards, paper, pen and cash all came together in one neat little package with my now best friend. SO...If your life sounds like mine - take that piece of plastic you keep using on things you know you can't afford - and make one of the best purchases you'll ever make. Even if it does take you a few years to pay it back, plus interest! PS - go to the palm.com website to get cool downloads too!"
2,The Honeymoon is Over,"I purchased the Palm V Deluxe Carrying Case by Palm in November of 2000 used it daily to carry my palm as my wallet in my purse and loved it! Until, in September 2001, the screen to my palm became damaged (cracked) due to the coins carried in the zipper compartment that lies directly on top of the palm pilot. Screens are not covered under Palm's manufacturers warranty, so $ later I will be switching to a hard case to carry my palm pilot in."
5,"i bought this in 2001, still lovin' it!","i fell in love with this carrying case, very handy, carries ATM cards, Palm handheld, note pad, sapce for coins and many many more. i'm still using it, believe it or not, it's still in a very good condition, if i had to buy it again, i wouldn't hesitate!"
1,"""PalmOne V Deluxe Carrying Case""",Amazon is only kidding you. They can NOT deliver this carrying case as they apparently aren't the ones selling it and the company selling it does not have it.
1,terrible. buy something else!!!!!!!,Can't get rid of bubbles! It won't stick to the right edge of screen at all. Impossible to install and I've installed many! Very gritty looming screen when it is on and finger drags. There is nothing good about this screen protector. All this and it is over priced!!!! Buy anything else!!!!
3,OK,"I was hoping to help my view while outside. The effect is minimal. It has a nice texture and does offer some glare assist. My biggest complaint is that my Note's pen has scratched the cover! Its ok, and I would probably buy it again because I enjoy having texture on the screen but it would be nice if it would last longer."
4,Great protector,"I would buy this again for sure because it's not flimsy or easily bent. When I first started using it, I noticed a little grainy effect compared to looking at the fabulous clarity of the naked glass screen, but worth the trade for protection and non-glare feature."
3,Just ok,"This screen protector does the job, but you can still see finger prints and smudges even though it says you wont. It scratches extremly easily! No problem with bubbles if you make sure theres no dust on your screen. Fits perfectly on at&t galaxy note."
2,turgid,"Hull is the standard introductory text on derivatives pricing. However, its popularity is more due to its age and inertia rather than merit. The style is turgid and the mathematics is woolly.It makes an interesting topic boring by solemnly saying a little about everything rather than moving to underlying concepts.If you want to understand derivatives pricing try Joshi, Baxter and Rennie, or Wilmott's Derivatives, and leave this book on the shelf."
3,All theory -- not practical at all,"Despite a wide coverage of topics, the book is way over priced. It is written at purely academic level and of limited use to practioners, quants, and traders who want to use and develop derivatives models. The books focuses on theory and the material is too simplistic. Important details on how to use or implement the models in practice is completely lacking. For instance, the book does not discuss the details for how to actually calibrate the parameters of the models to actual market data.If you want to learn the material in detail and how derivatives securities are actually modeled and implemented in practice using real-world data, I would strongly recommend a book like Modeling Derivatives in C++ or Principles of Financial Engineering."
4,The book must be updated with the emergence of BICs,"This book is just great. I just wish there could be a new edition that incorpoarate the BICs paradigm. More info on BICs can be found at http://www.4bics.org - BICs appears to be a too important concept to ignore,I understand its very recent but I hope prof hull will think about it"
3,"Sufficient for content, book is poorly constructed physically","The content of the book is wonderful, so this is more about the printing. The pages are printed on tissue thin paper that rip pretty easily and are falling apart. Get a different edition that's published in the US."
2,money wasted,"I surely do wish I'd never bought this book. As another reviewer said, it's worthless if you come to it expecting to read anything useful. ALl you get are very charming illustrations and a few pop up pages and Lulu Guiness's favorite sayings. That's it. If you have a bunch of Guiness bags and love Lulu then go right ahead and buy it. The rest of us would be better off checking it out of the library. I intend to return my copy."
3,"It's OK, I wouldn't say it's his best","It's got one of the usual Laumer plots - an unusually gifted mentor (with a long lifespan) teaches a moderately ordinary guy incredible stuff with which the guy can conquer incredible odds and live in an exotic place. It's a good read and I can understand people wanting to read it again after a few years. His stuff is like that. But this isn't the book I'd recommend to a first-time Keith Laumer reader. (Dinosaur Beach, probably...)"
5,Trace of Memory,"The librarian at my high school introduced me to this book in 9th grade (1977) I was blown away by the creativity of the story. Today, I read the same tattered text (purchased during a library book sale) bound by the library. The story of Foster and his odd memories creates a world familiar yet surreal. Truly one of the best sci fi books I have ever read."
1,Not as pictured.,"As you look at the picture it appears as it has a shoulder strap on the left and right side that goes behind bag, not so. The material and workmanship is very poor. I would not recommend this bag to anyone."
3,"Not bad, not great","Bought this as a gift for someone to take tailgating and its pretty nice. You basically get what you pay for with it. It held up pretty decently for being used sporadically over two years, then started to come apart at the seams. I wasn't incredibly disappointed, because it isn't very expensive and I felt like I had gotten my money out of it. If you are looking for something to use every day to take to and from work, I would definitely get a hard cooler because I have had multiple soft side coolers, and I haven't found one that would hold up to every day use for a long period of time."
2,Average,"This book is strictly not recommended if you don't have much experience of the language. I mean you would much rather want to know how to say your name in German than start off with 'I have two apartments and two wives!' But yes, the book is nicely organized. If you have some experience of the language and can pronounce it fairly well, then you can think of buying it . If you DO want to learn German and learn it well, then I recommend 'A complete course in understanding, speaking and writing German' by Paul Coggle and Heiner Schenke."
1,Help,Would someone who actually bought this book please review it.. I would like to buy it. but I would like to hear about it first.. thanks
2,Here's my two cents,It's hard for me to write this review considering the fact that I have never even held the book. I just wanted the oppertunity to be the first one to write a review for it. At least the cover is nice to look at.
5,An excellent concert. Timeless overtures.,"It's a waste of time being harking on about this CD too much, but one of the greatest guitarists ever, Uli Jon Roth shows all the speed and heartless players how the guitar is mean't to be played. Pure bliss."
4,Track listing...,Tracks...1) Sunshine For Everyone2) Easter3) Petty Little Stones4) Lollywhirl5) Induction To The Perfect Days6) Chasing The Sun7) So Easy To Do
3,It's buck pee...,I've used a bunch of brands and they all seem to produce the same results if you use them in one of those brown medicine bottles with the curly cue pig tail-like tube that you hang upside down from a tree branch over a real or artificial scrape. It *will* attracts bucks under the right conditions. Make sure you read the directions and don't get any of this stuff on you!
1,Most of the book is a crock,"Some good points made (more students taking theSAT,forexample), but most of the book is a crock. He fails toconsider many of the facts, such as our comparison with otherindustrialized nations, 1/5 of adults have rudimentary literacy skillsafter 12 or more years of schooling (and it isn't looking any betterthanks to education college professors), the SAT scores wererecentered in 1994, more students are taking remedial college courses,more students are taking college prep courses in high school, but theyaren't anymore prepared, etc, etc. He blames the tests for notshowing progress, rather than the source...PHILOSOPHY! Does theauthor watch Jay Leno?"
4,"Booklet taken from Yancy's larger work, Rumors of Another World","This is a small booklet taken from Yancy's larger work, Rumors of Another World. It is rich in content, as anything written by Yancy would be. He begins by asking why sex plays so large in America than in some small village in the Amazon where the locals wear nothing at all.In answering, Yancy seeks to recover a view of six that corresponds to God's original design. He looks at desire, purity, romance, sex, and marriage as he seeks to describe that original design. He draws from many sources to build his case, including C.S. Lewis, Martin Luther, and Flannery O'Connor.Final Note: Telephone and Online Counseling may be a great way to help couples and individuals struggling with sexuality issues. Learn to Provide Telephone and Online Counseling with this book:The Therapist's Clinical Guide to Online Counseling and Telephone Counseling: The Definitive Training Guide for Clinical Practice"
2,Did not know it was a booklet.,"The article by Yancey was good, but it is also found in Rumor's of Another World. I would have been better off to buy Rumor's of another World."
4,My Palm kit is now complete,"Lightweight, portable and simple. These words describe both the HotSync cradle that came with my Palm IIIx and this cable which I just purchased. However, if you travel a lot, and sync to a laptop or second computer, this cable is the way to go.I takes up virtually no room in a laptop bag, and can fit in virtually any luggage pocket (and also a suit pocket).There is no other software to install. Just pull the cable out of the bag, attach to your PC and Palm and sync using the HotSync icon on the Palm itself.One way that it could be improved would be with a button on the cable end itself which would trigger the HotSync. This would most likely make the cable more expensive and possibly less reliable over the long term, however. All in all, a well-designed and utterly useful product."
5,Very useful product,"With the Palm Hotsync Cable, I am able to sync my IIIxe at home and at the office. It is just the right length, plugs into my PDA easily, and is out of sight/out of the way when not in use. If you have a laptop, this is a must-have product. A great product at a great price."
4,Cable works fine,"This product is great for those with an older computer with serial ports. Unfortunately, very few users still have those. You will need a USB converter for this product."
5,Better option than buying an extra cradle,"If you're going to sync from more than one computer, this is a far better option than buying an additional cradle. To offset the lack of the convenient button on the cradle, you get better portability, a lower cost, and can hook it up to Palms that live in a carrying case without having to rip it away from the velcro."
2,Serial ports are a thing of the past,"I have to agree with other users that this is a great product, BUT it's not as practical as you may think. A USB sync cable is a better idea. Talk about convenience. Secondly, the cable is too long! Who needs 3' (or 2') or cable to connect a Palm to a Laptop computer? The reason why I'm writing this review is because I haven't been able to find a USB sync cable. I called Palm, there is none available. I visited the stores, there is none available. Will anybody have the brilliant (and obvious) idea of creating this device?! I also write this review for those of us who use laptop computers with USB ports and don't want anything to do with legacy hardware."
4,"It works,","All I can say is that I put it in my laptop and it works so far. Its a battery, what more can a say?"
1,Worst book ever!,"This book is poorly written, story ridiculous and virtually no ending. Don't waste your time."
5,Fabulous childrens book,"The birthday jewlery book, is a wonderfully written beautifully illustrated childrens book. We've read it many times to our children who have loved every word of it. Both our children and us learned a lot about birthstones and we highly recomend this book. This would make a great birthday gift for any child."
4,The Kinks still rock in the 90's,"This is an excellent CD that shows the Kinks still have a lot to offer. The song Hatred is a hilarious (and rocking) commentary on the relationship between the brothers Davies while Still Searching, Scattered and the title track are standouts."
4,Kinks Phobia ok,I think this is a really good release with a number of good tracks in my view. As always the Davies lyrics are catchy and well put together even if some of them are a bit negative.I really think this is a top album and a shame its their last. There is a lot of music on this album and is worth the effort if your are a Kinks fan. The Kinks are always good and you can always find something on any of their albums that you will like.
3,"I really wanted to love this, but......","it just isn't that good. Bear in mind that I have every Kinks CD ever released, and I've been a huge fan for over 30 years. This album has a few good tunes i.e. ""Still Searching"", ""Surviving"", ""Only A Dream"", etc, but the lowlights are really low. Most of these tracks could have fit right in to the ""Think Visual"" or the ""UK Jive"" album. Having said all this, I have had this in my collection since its release, and I listen to it again every once in a while to see if it has yet improved with age. So far, it hasn't. Worth it for the hardcore Kinks fan and/or completist, but not for everyone. Three stars out of 5......"
1,This just can't be,"I love love love the kinks...I hate this record, it really bites! I kept listening to it trying to like it, feeling disloyal for not liking it...but...it's just not possible. One song I found listenable...song called HATRED...hmmmmmm"
1,The end,"And a terrible one at that. There are scant few half decent songs on this album, but even those are ruined by the godawful production. The Kinks really sunk into mediocrity during the 80's, with each reverb drenched cheese rock opus leaving you completely baffled. This album however, was the nail in the coffin. From the piss poor lyrics, to the cheap looking album art right down to the songs themselves, this is sad on every level. It makes you wonder what happened to the incredible band that used to exist some 30 odd years ago, but even more so, ""WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING?"""
3,It's ok,"First I have to say I'm not a ""young reader"", which is who this book is intended for. I had a really hard time trying to imagine the various settings throughtout the book, even with the few pictures the book has. This might just be because I've never been to Austria and have never seen anything like the Hohensalzburg Fortress. Overall I thought the book was ok and the story was sweet."
4,This album finds a way to warm,"Before Bruce received notoriety with Wondering Where The Lions Are and If I had a Rocket Launcher,there was this easy going album.Some people buy later albums then go backwards.I had this on a cassette and at that time there was alot of accoustic music around.This one particular album is classic Cockburn.It has rich lyrics and overtones.Ah the seventies were a great spand too bad they won't come back."
4,Good Price/Product Mod required for Stepside,"Purchased these rails for a 79 Chevy Stepside, originally purchased product number 89886 which per the amazon site supposedly would fit my truck. (Not) They were way to short.Next I found the next closest product number on sale that was long enough to fit. I had to cut the tubes and drill to install (could not find any size to fit my stake holes even called manufacturer for exact dimensions as amazons are not always exact). Used a chop saw with metal blade and product installed fine looks good. Good design Stainless appears to be plated as opposed to solid FYI.They look good and am happy with fit and function but stepsides will require modifications."
3,Vacuum attachments,"This did not come with directions and fitting the attachments to the vac is quite tricky and we wound up having to call the company because we could not figure out how to attach it. It appeared a part was missing. Once we called, they told us it was in fact tricky to attach and explained how it would take a lot of force to attach the piece. You would think they would have included this with the parts!"
3,Probably a good idea,"It is annoying that these tools don't come with a $200 vacuum, but it's probably a good idea to pick these up. After all, you've come this far, right? I have a pellet stove, and all the tools have their uses. (the one with the clear tubing is needed for the occasional deep cleaning, when the access hatches are opened to get the fly ash out)I have a Cheetah ash vac, and I agree with the other review - there should be a way to store these tools with the main vacuum. (of course, there should be a better way to wrap the hose around the vac for storage as well) Maybe they'll invite me to one of their focus groups sometime..."
2,Looks useful but...,... since these were sold as attachments to a warm-ash vacuum it came as a surprise to me that these were simply plastic. Returned.
3,They were supposed to fit,The tools were supposed to fit my Ash Vac. I had to remove the rubber end from the hose.Only then would the crevice tool and round brush fit.
3,Accessory mess,"Whatever the fireplace mess, these Vacuum attachments make clean-up a snap. We love our Dustless even though it is a bit noisy and this accessory kit simply enhances its effectiveness."
2,Needs quality control,I was surprised that the cougar vacuum did not come with these items. The clear hose I received had the rubber end glued on backwards so it would not fit into the end of the hose rendering it unusable.
4,Fun Series,"We don't get enough sports anime in america so I was real happy when I first heard about this show. This is typical sports fair where a group of people get enough people together to create a team and from there learn to play with one another as a team and get better through a series of trials. What makes this series different is it's very short at only 12 episodes and it takes place in the 1920s so everything is just starting to get westernized. Not as good as Touch, H2, or more recent ones such as Cross Game and Princess Nine but at only 12 episodes there's not a lot they can do. If you like sports anime, this isn't bad. It kept me entertained for the entire 12 episode so I can't complain."
4,"A good book, but not a great book","As usual, David and Marc Muench have published a fairly solid photography book. However, this is by no means their best book, and it's not even David Muench's best book on Colorado. It appears that Marc Muench took the photos for this book over the last few years, whereas David Muench's photos may have been leftovers that weren't included in 'Colorado II' (which was published before 'Colorado'). After seeing this book, I still rank Colorado II as the #1 book in my list of 'Best Colorado Picture Books' (which can be seen by clicking on my name), and I therefore recommend that book over this one."
3,Not a very thoughtful book composition,The book has some stunning photographs but I am struck by the frequent clash between the photos on opposite pages. There seems to be no attention to balance in the assembly of photos in this book.
4,GREAT TRIBUTE!,"I love this wonderful tribute to the Ramones.I Was sceptical about buying it at first because some artists on it just don't belong like U2 or marilyn manson,and especially,the pretenders (ugh!).Anyway,the songs are great and all the bands did a great job recreating them,But if they were going to come out with a second ramones tribute album,these should be the tracks:1.Yeah Yeah Yeahs ""Rockaway Beach""2.Sum 41 ""Judy Is A Punk""3.Slipknot ""Pet Cemetary""4.Foo Fighters ""California Sun""5.KoRn ""Surfing Bird""6.NOFX ""The Crusher""7.Brain Setzer Orchestra ""Pinhead""8.White Stripes ""Listen To My Heart""9.Drowning Pool ""Commando""10.Presidents Of The USA ""Bonzo Goes To Bitburg""11.Flaming Lips ""Garden Of Serenity""12.Avril Lavigne ""Glad To See You Go""13.Coheed And Cambria ""We're A Happy Family""14.System Of A Down ""Cretin Hop""15.A Perfect Circle ""Rock N Roll High School""16.Radiohead ""Teenage Lobotomy""17.Moby ""Psycho Therapy""pretty weird lineup,huh?"
5,Kick... tribute to a band i hate!,"The way this tribute was put together was simply amazing. Rob Zombie seemed to know what song fitted with the bands style. Like Havana Affair, the way the Red Hot Chili Peppers did it was amazing, and Marylin Manson singing The KKK Took My Baby Away was eerie and just bad ass. The craziest thing about it is i hate the Ramones!!!!!!!!!!!! I admit that there is some songs of theirs i like, but not a whole lot. They dont even have talent! But to sum it all up, this cd is amazing."
2,Yuck~,"I saw this on a listening station at a CD store, and thought I'd give it a shot. I'll premise this by saying that I am a HUGE Rob Zombie fan; but Zombie's version of ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" has got to be one of the worst things I have ever heard in my life. I mean, it was simply terrible. Then Bono trying to pull off ""Beat on the Brat"" was simply embarrassing. Metallica? Yeah, o.k....All in all I could not find too much to salvage on this album. Rancid is good. I didn't listen to the Offspring track, so maybe that one's o.k., but the rest is terrible, so why buy a whole CD for one or two good tracks?A proper tribute would have at least had X, Iggy Pop, Jello Biafra, Henry Rollins, Social Distortion, Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Frank Black, and many other people who actually wrote music that either inspired or was inspired by the Ramones."
4,"Sitting here in Queens, eating refried beans","There have been several Ramones tribute albums, but this is the first one to feature ""big name"" acts. The results are varied, of course, like on any tribute album. The young ""pop punk"" acts Green Day, Rancid and the Offspring perform good faithful versions of the songs. Most of the other acts try to put their own spin on the songs. The most interesting variations are, to me, by Red Hot Chili Peppers, Garbage, The Pretenders, Tom Waits (Grammy nominated for his song on this album) and John Frusciante (unlisted bonus track). Most of the songs are at least decent, except for Marilyn Manson's dirge-like version of ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"", which is god-awful. This CD should be of interest to Ramones fans who don't mind hearing their heroes songs played in different styles."
2,Ug...the labels are at it again...,"I know that Rob Zombie had the best of intentions in releasing this record. I really do. This fact does NOT save this record from being an utter trashpile with few memorable moments. The Kiss and Rob Zombie covers surge well enough, but overall this record is a tired retread by bands paying tribute to a band who probably would have loathed them had they been in the same era and league.Skip it."
3,some good songs,i though rooney and the red chili peppers weere the best bands. the manosn song is ok i like rob zombie just not that song. the tom waits song its pretty bad. i like how every band did the song in there own way. metallica did one of my favorite ramones songs 50 third and 3rd but is was just not that good. but there wer a few bands that werer good. i think it is wirth buying but like it said everyone had there own style so do expect it to be just like there songs.
2,Horrible,"I bought it because I love Ramones. I put it in my cd player and had to take it out, it was so bad. The bands on it are really good, but they are horrible at remaking ramones songs. I would advise anyone who wants it, dont spend a lot of money on it, like I did. Just copy it."
3,Beat on the Bono,"Bono tries to get respect as a musician by saying that he's a fan of the best punk group to ever walk this earth. Sadly, his version of ""Beat on the brat"" is boring and tedious. However the RHCPeppers do a great version of ""Havanna Affair"" wich in itself is worth the album."
3,What Did I Expect?,"Question One: why not listen to the original versions if you've got a taste for The Ramones?Question Two: am I the only one who feels the superb lineup of talent on this CD comes off as The Ramones Lite?Question Three: would this CD have been remotely as compelling if DeeDee and Joey were still alive?Summary: enjoyable, but doubtful that I'll play it anywhere near regularly once the novelty has worn off."
5,This CD Rocks,"I have to start by saying I don't know anything about The Ramones. I bought this cd because I am a die hard Kiss fan. Boy! Was I surprised! The sheer talent of the bands on this CD alone is worth the price. Kiss, U2, Metallica, Eddie Vedder, Rancid, Offspring, to name just a few. And the songs they played rock! Marilyn Manson's might be the lamest song of the set and even it isn't so bad. The best probably belongs to Kiss' version of ""Rock and Roll Radio."" This has made me want to get the Ramones original recordings. Whether you like the Ramones, the bands on this tribute, or just good rock, this cd is definitely worth owning."
2,It's the thought that counts...,"This ""tribute"" solidifies what many fans of the Ramones have known for years. The only people who should play Ramones songs are The Ramones. I am sure that the participants of this tribute, with the blessing of Johnny and under his supervision, mean well enough. The problem is that on the surface those who chose to alter the arrangments to put their own stamp on these songs have missed the mark trying to be different and those who remained faithful to the bands original version can't do them justice. True fans will want this album to support the band and the legacy they left behind but it will not be something they will listen to more than a few times. Fans of those artists participating and casual Ramones fans will be greatly disappointed. There are too many missteps here to go track by track to discuss but the novelty of this tribute is that it will be perceived as just a novelty. Leave the Ramones songs to the Ramones."
4,"Weird, but great","Imagine that you just ran into an old girlfriend/boyfriend that you haven't seen in 20 years. They are the same person, you (hopefully) still like them, but you keep thinking back to what they were like when you were dating.That's what this album is like. I thought each track was great, with each band putting their own spin on the tunes, but immediately afterwards had to go back and listen to the originals. Not a bad thing; in fact I recommend the album to any Ramones fan for both the music and the way it revives memories you didn't know you had.If you don't know the Ramones, I still recommend it, just go out and get the originals afterwards."
2,Flat and uninspired,"Most of this is a joke...seriously. Metallica sound like a bunch of old men. Rob Zombie creates a disco version of ""Blitzkrieg Bop"", Manson's version is a predictable slow & creepy take, the Offspring's inclusions shows how out of touch Rob Zombie is.Kiss, Eddie Vedder & Zeke, Rancid, and Tom Waits are basically the only versions worth checking out. Rooney? Gee, thanks Weezer. Skip this and buy the Ramones tribute on White Jazz Records that features the Hellacopters, Sahara Hotnights, Jesse Malin, Gluecifer, etc."
2,...Big Name Bands don't impress me...,I think this tribute should of had more punk bands doing the songs. It is a pretty lame line-up if you ask me. I do like Metallica and U2 but they don't do the Ramones the way they needed to be done. In My opinion the Line-Up Sucks but there are some good songs.
2,Near miss...... still interesting though.,"Bought this on a whim. It's a true tribute to how many artist site this simple & unique band from Queens, NY as a influence. The tracks range from intriguingly different (R.H. Chilipeppers, Rob Zombie & Tom Waits) to unchangingly consistant (U2, Garbage, Green Day & Offspring) to just downright silly & uninspired (no better example than M. Manson's ""The KKK Took my Baby Away""... one of my personal favorite Ramone tunes). If you find this used for around $6 or under (like I did)... it's worth it. Otherwise there are better ways to spend your time and money (I guess that's why there are about 53 used copies for sale here), especially if you do not have the original Ramones recordings of these cuts (classics!!). Just one more thing... THANK YOU RAMONES FOR SAVING ROCK N' ROLL!!"
1,worst... record... ever...,"The covers on the album from punk bands like Rancid are OK but are total [junk]next to the real thing (aren't all tribute songs?) On the other hand theres Manson's version of ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"" that [smelled].... a lot. Rob Zombie's ""Blitzkreg Bop"" would be good if they played faster because the Ramones were known to be ""loud and fast"" so the songs that were slowed down [were bad.] Don't buy this...because it's not worth it."
2,Beat on the Brats,"From Stephen King's stoopid, embarrassing liner notes (and that's not ""stoopid, embarrassing"" in a good way) to Bono mincing his way through ""Beat on the Brat,"" this package is stunningly misguided. KISS comes off the best, which should tell you all that you need to know. This is the Ramones as product, which goes against everything they were about. One two three four chuck the thing out the door."
2,BORING Disappointment - 4 good tracks out of 17!,"This should have been and so easily could have been a great album. As it turned out, only four of the seventeen artists(Metallica, Kiss, Peter Yorn, and Garbage) play any inspired tributes to The Ramones that would be enjoyable to their fans. Most of the tracks are such ludicrous reinterpretations that their departures from the source material approximate the tongue-in-cheek satire of ""Mefirst and the Gimme Gimmes"" or ""The Flying Lizards"" but without the loving respect or creativity of these cover bands. This is closer to the ""Golden Throats"" compilation where we hear William Shatner singing ""Mr. Tambourine Man!"" A one-listen curiosity and a BORE!!!"
3,They Can do Much Better,"I own both the DVD and the CD and the CD is better than the DVD, If you like W&Y you will be sort of dissapointed by this CD, but you will still enjoy some of it. Now if this is your first exposure to W&Y do yourself a favor and buy their new CD Los Extraterrestres, that is their best CD, where they have taken their musical talent is unbelievable!"
5,Results demonstrated from using this Jewel,"As a psychotherapist I find this book a real jewel for recognizing and overcoming habits that no longer serve us. Drs Willard and Gibertini, uniquely in this litrature, recognize the strenghts of co-dependent traits and build change plans targeted on precisely what really doesn't work in our lives now.My clients also have found great benefit in the accompanying journal so behaviors can be better identified, thus moving from idea to action now."
5,Dustless Technologies Mu405R Cougar Ash Vacuum,"Hi,I'm so happy w the Dustless Vacuum, my pellet stove is running so much better especially w this cold snap, no dust,very efficient sucking up the ash in the stove, even while running, over all an A++ rating,don't know how i survived without it...life is goodDustless Technologies MU405R Cougar Ash Vacuum, Red"
3,not quiet,"I do have the Cougar 3 gallon vac , it does a great job with ash from my pellet stove. They are prone to clogging with clinkers but just wack them with the steel nozzle and there gone. But quiet there not, you should wear ear protection."
3,Cougar Ash Vacuum,"We believe that the Cougar Ash Vacuum is better for pellet stoves that leave fine ash than for woodstoves like we have, since any small chunk of charcoal from 1/4"" in diameter upward clogs up the hose. We need to configure a mesh filter for the hose end and hope it works. This vac's a great idea, but doesn't yet work for us. We'll see how our mesh filter works out. It'd be great if Dustless Technologies would invent something that would help us adapt this nice little vac for woodstove use!"
2,It's OK for fine ash but anything bigger than a 1/2 inch nugget of wood.,"I've had the Cougar MU405 for about 2-3 years now and the vacuum works OK for fine ash. But a small nugget will either block up the hose or the entry to the vacuum requiring you to stop and unclog it. I have a double sided wood burning fireplace and this happens consistently even after taking significant amount of time to pull as many pieces out by hand as I can. Also, the metal flexible hose comes out of one end of the rubberized endings and can be a pain to get back in. I've had no problem with the motor thus far and it does a good job sucking up the ash. But the cheap connection of the hose and the continuous clogging keeps me from recommending the vacuum."
2,"Cleans up some games, but not others","I tend to play lots of games. I build many model ships, am an avid train collector, and have worked on many wood-crafts with my 2 year old son. Most of the games leave big messes. Plastic pieces, wood chips, etc. I work on a rubberized garage floor so I figured this vacuum would be perfect for picking up the scraps. It's good for some hobbyists, but for someone who plays as many games as me, this just cant handle my mess. It clogs easily, breaks down after just a few games, and once sucked my son's foot into it and I had to break the machine to get it to turn off. I would recommend this machine for novice game players, but if you're at the intermediate, or advanced level (I should know), you'll want to avoid this."
4,Outstanding item,"I purchased this vacuum shortly after installing my pellet stove when fuel oil in Fairbanks, Alaska, climbed over $4 per gallon forcing me to spend $1,000 on a monthly fill-up. The downside to stoves is the regular cleaning required and I'd seen the videos of household and shop vacs bursting into flame after ingesting a live ember. This Cougar unit gave my wife and me peace of mind while making routine cleaning a 10-minute affair. It is no louder than a push vac, much quieter than a shop vac, and compact enough to hide away in a basement corner. The one down side is tools (which I review elsewhere)-- they must be purchased separately and there' s no onboard storage. It would not be difficult to design a caddy into the plastic motor cover or design one that mounts to the metal bucket portion. Love-less, please think about ""customer solutions"", as we call it in retail, and give the buyer a one-stop purchase solution with a convenient design."
1,It sucks like a dustbuster,"I bought this vacuum to clean the ash out of my wood stove. Well, it will clean the ash that is burned to a dust and nothing else. I thought when I read the other reviews that people were complaining about large objects not being sucked up, but what they are talking about is the small peices of wood that are not burned to ash (1"" or more). I had to stop evey 20 seconds to unclog the nossle, what a p.i.t.a. I wanted to return it, but that is not that simple after you try it or 3 days passes. I am going to keep it rather than to lose a 25% restocking fee but, I would not of purchased this vacuum if I knew what I know now."
4,Ash Vacuum Cleaner,"Needed a vacuum for a pellet stove. There are two models, a quite one and a not so quite one. The quiet one is a hair louder than your standard vacuum cleaner. The end where it connects to the unit keeps falling off. However, the unit is made very well and if it broke today, I'd order another one tomorrow. The not so quiet one, too noisy for comfort. Something got mixed up and I received the noisy one by mistake. The vendor kept in touch, paid for shipping, this vendor could not have been better. Good job, thank you !!!"
4,Dustless MU405 Ash Vacuum,"I have had this Vacuum for several weeks now and it is great. No puff outs ,easy to clean and work withDustless Technologies MU405 Cougar Ash Vacuum, Black"
3,Ok...but doesn't reflect its name,"Yes as others have said this vacuum is very noisy. Assembly is easy and it does not take up a lot of room. You MUST follow the instructions for vacuuming. It does not work like your home vacuum. The nozzle is a small diameter and intended to pick up only ash. I was hoping for more suction, but I am not totally disappointed. It is saving my home vacuum and keeps my husband happy as I am not using his shop vacuum."
2,Not worthwhile for wood stoves,"This ash vacuum may be good for pellet stoves, but is not worth buying if you have a wood stove. The small pieces of wood continually clog within the hose where the hose and vacuum connect. You can only use this on ashes that are completely cold, otherwise the airflow ignites the embers again. Not great when you want to build a fire every day...probably okay for someone who only builds a fire once a week."
1,Look Elsewhere!,"I purchased this ash vacuum less than one month ago for use with a pellet stove. In that time, and with only light use, the ""flexible"" hose has cracked, the motor is making a funny noise as it winds down, and the suction is significantly decreased long before the canister needs emptying. I would never buy this again, and would recommend to anyone needing an ash vac to look elswhere."
1,Overpriced Poorly Designed Product,This review is for the Ash-less Cougar Ash Vac. I used it only three times. I bought this to use with a pellet stove. Even new this has little suction compared to shop vacs. I bought it for the special ash filters which did seem to work. If it only had good suction. But shop vacs with a good HEPA filter work just as well in that regard with a lot more suction. I used mine only a few times when I decided to use a shop vac. What a difference. I was going to sell it on ebay when I noticed the inlet mount for the hose was cracked. So I kept the couple of big filter clamps and threw the thing out in the trash. Those were expensive clamps. You can't suck up hot ashes with either vac so the Ash Vac is unnecessary for 3 or 4 times the cost. Plus you can get the shop vac filters cheaply anywhere but the Ash Vac has exclusive expensive filters. Hope this prevents somebody making the same mistake I made.
3,Decent seat,"I didn't really shop around so I can't compare pricewise, but it is plenty sturdy and can take my 215lbs rockin' around on it. It does not swivel unless you loosen the seat which can then come off when you lift on it to move it, but it never came off while I (or my son) was playing. Plenty comfortable."
1,Only for the Looks,"I bought this product to play on Rock Band 3. Now, I'm not a real drummer, so I don't use this for my full potential. However, after about 30 minutes of playing on Expert, one of the legs bent and I fell over. I attempted to force the bent leg into place, and continued playing. After about 15 minutes of playing, it bent again. This is not a quality product."
5,What a workout - What FUN,"This video was a great workout, and it was also a lot of fun. We did kicking combinations that I have never seen before, it was awesome. There was this one kick, I think Rich called it a ""creasant"" kick, anyway it was great. I felt muscles working that I haven't felt for years. Not only was this video one heck of a workout, but Rich Grogan was very entertaining, and he made the workout fun. Some other aerobic instructors could learn a few lessons from Rich, like the word FUN.Great video - I love it!"
2,Boring...,"I read all the good reviews here and thought this would be an exciting workout. It was very disappointing though, because it exists of only punching and kicking, and no exciting combinations to keep you interested. I did not get my heartrate up and was very bored. For a more intense and fun workout I would recommended any of Janis Saffell's videos!"
5,Excellent - Just what you'd expect,"I bought this video for my wife after buying the kids exericse video - Kick to Get Fit jr. for Kids. I was truly impressed with the kids exercise video, and I am even more impressed with this video. My wife has a hard time with most aerobic videos, because to be honest, she finds them boring. This video is far from boring. Just like with the kids video, Rich Grogan interacts with the people in the video, and also with the viewer, he makes everyone feel a part of the program. He also has a tremendous amount charisma, he really makes this program fun & enjoyable. Just like with the kids video, I 100% recommend this to all my friends. If you are looking for a fun workout, this is it."
5,I'm Amazed with all the Kick to Get Fit Programs,"This is the second Kick to Get Fit program I have purchased. I bought Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids a few weeks ago, and my kids and I absolutely LOVE IT. So I thought I would try one of the Kick to Get Fit adult exercise videos. - And I'm here to tell you, it is just as AWESOME as the kids video, but it is for adults.Rich Grogan breaks things down in an easy to follow pattern, he takes the time to show you how to properly do each movement, and then he gets you going. I did movements in this video that I haven't seen in other aerobic videos. These movements weren't only different & challenging, but they were also a lot of fun to do.If you haven't seen any of these Kick to Get Fit programs, you owe it to yourself to check them out. My family loves them, and I'm sure your family will to."
2,"Great concept, but didn't work for me",I got this when i found out I was pregnant 6 month after having my belly button pierced and I didn't want any chance of it closing up. It is too long and the balls on the end just fell off. It was just odd to wear. Ended up just getting a normal belly button ring that was a bit longer and took it out for delivery and but it back in afterwards and worked much better than this product.
2,Not really worth it,"Looking back, I wouldn't purchase this item... both of the pieces are plastic and the little black ends fell off constantly. Not worth the hassle."
4,An intriguing plotline,"Some people are of the opinion that the Batman genre, one that exemplifies modernism in so many respects, should never mix with anything of the superstitious or supernatural. I am not one of those. Even if I was, ""Gothic"" would have probably changed my mind.Batman is drawn to a place from his past when men are murdered in a chapel. From this trail of destruction Batman is led to confront a terrifying evil that has existed for nearly 300 years.Batman is himself the stuff of many legends and superstitions. He preys on the fear of criminals that he might be some monster or demon. How will he fare when he faces a being that is worthy of such fear?Batman ""Gothic"" is actually an intriguing piece that is inspired by literary greats like ""Faust."" Morrison's title is very appropriate and for once, I actually enjoyed the foreword that explained the reasoning behind the storyline. This is good stuff."
3,A Good Read,"The story is a rather straightforward telling of gang murders and Batman solving the crimes. Some violence, but little complexity. I apologize for the mediocre rating -- it reflects my personal tastes but doesn't lessen the fact that I'd recommend this to Batman fans and fans of the medium. Grant Morrison writes a tight plot here, but there's really nothing new. As for the art, Klaus Janson has a jerky, rough style, but I really admire his composition if not his rendering. I had him as an instructor for graphic storytelling, and this guy really has depth to his storytelling -- every pane is a thoughtful and complex solution to a communication problem. Also - an inside scoop - in one of the panes, Batman appears with 6 fingers!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A collection from early on in the Legends of the Dark Knight series.A bunch of mob bosses realise someone is murdering them one by one. The person who is doing it is someone they killed 20 years before. Calling Batman for help, he basically says sit on it and rotate, until he realises who the killer is, and it gets personal.It also gets a bit horror movie.3.5 out of 5"
3,I'm a big Grant Morrison fan...,...But I found this kinda boring. Especially compared to GM's other Batman work. And I was really looking forward to seeing Klaus Janson--who I love--team up with Grant.
2,"Weak story, worse art","First off, this is all opinion and I'm sure there are people out there that will love this book. I, however, did not. The story was barely mediocre and I personally did not like the art. Frames where characters were close up were pretty good. The defacto half-page or more shot of batman that is in every book was pretty cool, but when the frames had characters far away it seemed very sloppy.Also, the main villain had an above average back story, be he himself was not very interesting at all. If you are a die hard Batman fan you will both need to read it, and be disappointed when comparing to some of your favorites."
4,Long live Klaus Janson!!!,"And long live Grant Morrisson....Although this is not his best- there's something old fashioned about this story , a detective story which takes the hero to an exotic location...Nice and old school"
4,Fun Story,"I got this as a gift. Without knowing anything about it, but loving other works of Grant Morrison, I jumped right in. Easy read. A lot of fun, nothing to deep in regards to the overall Batman storyline. Just a great, enjoyable book."
2,Bog Standard dance album from the late 90's,"One of the better fantasia albums, but not the best in the genre. Cheesy tunes, charty classics make this an average selection. Fantastic skill from Healy and WhiteHead make thi worth buying, but only if the late 90's were the period you were clubbing.If you are after a CD to get you going on a saturday night - look elsewhere!"
4,Great solution. Instructions not for novices.,"I unstalled the Curt 13220, purchased from Amazon, on a 2007 Audi Q7. The result is great. However, if you plan to only use the supplied instructions, you may spend a long time finding the actual screws and nuts to remove. Also, one of the bolt holes in the hitch was slightly out of alignment, which made things difficult. However, the result is outstanding."
4,EASY installation,"This trailer hitch swaps out the original bumper.The crossbar is totally hidden.The only thing is, the hitch ""sticks out"" a little to muchfrom the bumper.(an inch shorter on the hitch would be great)."
2,Ok,I wouldn't read it again. But if you are completely bored and have read everything else in the library it would be ok.
1,Stale.,"Love Mary's Gone crackers, but hate the price. Trying to be thrifty, I decided to switch to these; I have bought this brand of crackers before, from local grocery stores. After they arrived I opened up the first package, blecchh. Out of date. Tossed the package, figured it was a one-off. Next package, same thing. third package, ditto. Don't think I am going to test my luck further. I looked into returning them, but as they are a food item, they cannot be returned. I have subscribe and save for a number of gluten-free foods, this is the first and hopefully only) time I have receieved something in-edible. Back to Mary's from now on."
3,Rich imagery provides wonderful depth to political angst.,"Written in the shadow of Ronald Reagan's 80's, Cockburn struggles to reconcile his socialist pacifism with the daunting spectre of the Cold War, Third World Dept, and dictatorships. Typically, this album provides few answers (outside of (armed?) revolution) and Cockburn chooses instead to illustrate in poetic detail the many evils one may find in backwater nations. The music and vocals are occasionally interesting, but lack the sensitivity of many of his works; one song(the grinding ""People See Through You"") should never have happened. Now that American foreign policy has helped the good people of Central America build a foundation of democracy, unify Europe, thaw the Cold War, and FREE THE HOSTAGES, I think Cockburn should re-write this album, and amplify the problem of the IMF, international debt, and the corporate-welfare shell game known as international trade."
2,Not 100% Cotton,"The cap comes with a polyester lining to which I am extremely allergic. I was going to return the item, but then realized that I could (with a lot of effort) cut the lining out. I did so. Now it's fine."
2,Narrow-minded,"Like too many Americans, Scot approaches Nepal as a mysterious secret land. Her book is full of wonderful theories and ideas to help this backward nation, but her notions are little more than jabs at the West and progress. In a country where only 45% of the population is literate I don't think any nation with resources should sit by and let them ""figure it out for themselves."" I have spent a few years living in differing regions of Nepal and did not come away with this mystical notion of a people that Scot so dearly clings to her heart. Perhaps she should have scrutinized a little more and wore the rose coloured glasses a little less. I don't recommend this book."
3,"To the author: Less about Birds, More about the Nepalis","I read this book researching an upcoming trip to Nepal. I was not looking for a feminist dialog about the culture, but I figured I could get some insider knowledge about the people (and women) of Nepal. To my surprise, I did not get an anthropological view, but rather a detailed description of the flora and fauna of Nepal through the eyes of a jogger. I was hoping this book would provide insights into the people of Nepal, but after the author spent nearly a year there her observations where as foreign as mine half a world away. Many questions concerning the culture were left unanswered and I was left with many more questions than answers. This might be great for discussion, but did not aid my search for understanding of this admittedly complex culture. Ultimately, the observations are outdated (almost 9 years old) and the insights hollow."
3,Kim Allen's Psychic Tea Cup,"I love Kim Allen, actually had a reading with her once and she is on weekly with Miss Jones in the morning (NYC radio) show on Hot 97. The cup is nice, I really haven't tried it for a reading yet-- haven't gotten any loose tea but I guess it would be fun to use."
3,Word Workout is Alright,"What I like about this programme is that it actually explain the use of word roots such as the 'pre' prefix and presented a few examples of words using the same word root. Also, it actually spell out the word for you in the programme. So there is no need for you to fiddle with a booklet to refer to the word. Just pop in the tape and listen while you drive or while doing your own work. I would have preferred the programme to be longer. And maybe include a female speaker for more variety!"
1,Dress Code,"Although the cover of this product is quite cute, upon watching the first few seconds of this preview I noticed the little pre-schoolers were wearing mid-drif shirts. Call me conservative (yay!) but this is not Dancing with the Stars-these are 5 year olds. I do not wish to give my little one the impression that we should throw modesty out the window just because its called ""dance"". Sorry but I will not be purchasing this product."
1,Time For Dancing Preschool Dance Experience DVD,"I always read reviews before purchasing something, the reviews I read had to be for something else, this was a total waste of money. My granddaughter was extremly bored whereas she loves all of her other videos. This one just wasn't engaging enough for her."
2,Blurry and too zoomed in,"Many of the scenes are very blurry. They are also so close up, you can hardly see any of the dancing at all. There is no dance training, instructions, direction at all either. It also jumps around a bit. I try and keep my child from watching things that skip about so I think this video is out."
2,Boring,I bought this dance video for my two year old. She loves to day. This video is dated and boring. I would not recommend it.
1,scam!,"SCAM SCAM SCAM!!! RIP-OFF!!This product was sealed, as if it was supposed to be ""new"" ..it's a poorly (and I mean POORLY!!) reproduced copy!!!there is sound in the beginning, then it cuts out when the video actually begins!!SCAM SCAM SCAM!!! RIP-OFF!!DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
1,These guys are jerks,"Had dinner with these guys in San Francisco when they were touring the US promoting this album. They were arrogant and talked nothing but s**t about their fans - which was hilarious to me because these were not the most intelligent guys (ie, they were intellectual doorknobs) I'd ever met and if you've heard their music you know that talent doesn't live in their house. Just thought you might want to know that before you invest your money in one of their 'albums'."
5,Amazing value!,"I can't recommend this box of postcards more highly. They are large postcards (not the index-card sized ones often found in postcards sets/bokos. The paper is good quality and feels nice to hold. There is truly a card for every occasion. Best of all, the value is astonishing, considering the exceptional overall quality--only 20 cents per card! You could easily pay over a dllar for one of these cards in a museum shop. I can't wait to start mailing these!"
2,"Not that varied a selection, cheesy aesthetic","Out of the 100, I found three that I'd be willing to spend a stamp on. Definitely investigate Mr. Fletcher's visual style and see if it turns your crank, because the cards are almost all one aesthetic, and I found it cheesy and dated (mid 80's, maybe?). I'm keeping the wooden box (which was a little broken, but easily fixable with gaffer's tape), but I have no use for 97% of the cards. If you're looking for a nice varied set of beautiful photo postcards, as I was, you can't go wrong withPostcards: 50 Postcards from the Book 'Magnum' (Postcards)"
3,Good to know...,"I, too, love the postcards. I participate in a postcard exchange and can easily find appropriate cards, especially for those seeking quirky cards. It did surprise me to learn that these require standard letter postage for delivery inside the U.S. I did not realize the USPS has a maximum size for the postcard rate to apply."
2,meh,"This was a really disappointing box of postcards. I would not buy them again. They are nice and big, and they are loose in the box (that is, not bound in a book) but that's about all they have going for them. I only liked about 10 of them, the others being mostly mediocre to ""who the heck can i even send this to?"" There are much better boxed sets of cards out there. (I much preferred the McSweeney's box.)"
2,Okay in a pinch,"I had high hopes for these cards, but was disappointed. Out of the 100 cards, I found maybe 20 that I was excited to mail. The rest I find I've been using for post card clubs when the recipient states ""random,"" ""artsy,"" or ""weird"" as types of cards they would like to receive. Even so, I always fear they'll be disappointed when they open the mailbox.The cards are all high quality and are packaged in a handy wooden box."
2,Mostly just odd filler.,"Unfortunately I based my order off the positive reviews and the price not being so bad for the amount you're getting and bought them sight unseen. I was unable to cancel my order in time and I will be returning these once I get them. I don't doubt at all that the quality is nice and the size is good but I found a thumbnail online of all 100 cards and I didn't like most of them. I probably only liked 5 or so. Different people have different taste and a lot of them are nice looking art cards but just not my taste. So, just do yourself a favor and look up a picture of them before you order so you know what you're getting."
3,"I like the box they came in, but they were more arty and less maverick.",I didn't feel they matched the 'maverick' description - but they've been great for sending basic sentiments with.
4,Good Variety for the money!,"I am pleased to have purchased these postcards. [...]. I'm always looking for unique postcards to send, and there are many of those in this batch of 100 postcards."
4,Great price,Great price for that many postcards. The box totaly fell apart though. The box made great kindling wood!
2,Not worth it...,"I bought this postcard box because I thought all 100 postcards would be unique and creative. When I opened the already-broken wooden box, I found out that all 100 cards were similar to each other, and some are almost identical because all cards are made by Alan Fletcher. If you like his works then this item is perfect for you, but as for me, I couldn't care less. Over-sized cards are shiny and look sort of cheesy, the paintings (?) are simple and abstract. When I saw the package image with typed letters I thought this would be perfect for my collection, but I was wrong... the worse thing is that a friend of mine also bought this boring card box and sends those cards to me! I was so annoyed when she sent me a card with countless short black lines saying ""my dog's fur"" or something. Even I can draw that!"
2,Buyer Beware,"This is not a paperback book - it is a small pamphlet of a few pages. It is informative. It is a pamplet that was originally included with a copy of ones own Astro Carto Graphy map when purchased a printout from a particular company.If you have an astrology computer software program that prints Astro Carto Graphy maps you might find it helpful. But if not, I think you would consider it overpriced. It is NOT the Jim Lewis paperback book you might have expected."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!,"I sincerely hope the clown who supervised this transfer has been demoted to cleaning toilets or shoveling excrement of some sort. Incompetence like this is unacceptable. I own better than 1000 DVDs, about half of which are budget DVDs I purchased for a dollar or thereabouts. This DVD, however, has by far the worst transfer I have ever seen. I copied this movie from cable to a cheap video cassette (EP mode) eight years ago, and that old tape looks a hell of a lot better than this embarrasment. The picture is jittery whenever movement is present on the screen, and the color looks totally washed out. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! Great movie...pick it up on VHS."
5,"Simply Wow, Best Aquarium Hobby Book Ever","I don't write reviews usually because I have better things to do and most products accomplish their purpose simply to par, but after reading this I feel like Diana Walstad should be heading the EPA. This book is irritatingly long yet succinct, annoyingly thorough, with meticulous references for every piece of information presented. If you own a fish or fishes, there should be a law forcing you to read this book. Now if only a book existed for dog owners we would be in business. There is too much to even paraphrase but if you have a pond, a fish tank, a planted tank, or if you fish actively (I hold IGFA all tackle-world records and this book gave me some incredible trout insights), this book is a must. Don't be cheap about its price, I paid $30, had I known what I was getting I would have gladly paid $100+. Anyone who wrote a negative review on this book was in special education classes during their schooling and currently works at the Post Office."
3,Reference for Planted Aquarium,"I bought this for my boyfriend who loves the planted aquarium hobby, and I thought it would be great reference to the mechanics of a beautifully planted aquarium. He did like it and looked at it a couple of times, but overall, he said that it was too plain and he already knew most of the information from the internet. Now, when he does internet research on something, he's not kidding around. He looks up every article and every forum. So unless you too LOVE internet research, maybe this book will save you a lot of time by compiling it all together."
3,To much science.,I love the idea behind this book. But it seems I don't even know high school biology and found most of it to be useless in helping with my planted tanks.Only part of any use could be in a much smaller book with a smaller price tag is in the back about how to set up and care for this type of tank set up.Frankly I don't care why it works I just want to know how to make it work and keep it working.Would love to see a new book that addresses the tank and issues with it more and less science.
1,Don't be FOOLED...,"This book is nothing more than a scientific put-down of modern aquariums. Her instructions are exactly the opposite of common beliefs among what she calls ""High-tech"" aquaria; don't install light, don't prewash gravel, don't change water. Why? because everyone else does! She's basically saying you don't have to spend any money on filters, heaters, lights, etc. But for that you'll have to be a scientist and a naturalist. It's not practical and except for a few individuals that seem to be intrigued with ANY new thing, it's going to die among hobbyists fairly quickly.Don't waste your money."
5,A very qualified 5 stars,"What an outstanding book!But unless you are a veteran aquarist or have a science background, as I do, it is VERY dense and you are likely only to take away a few bullet points. The author concedes that this book is not for novice aquarists (which I am) and the only thing that kept me afloat was my science education. Thus, I rate it a QUALIFIED 5 stars.But, wow, I learned an AMAZING amount."
4,"Practical, yet scientific.","This book can be useful to the layman and has the depth for the pro.The author clearly knows her subject and has the technical expertise. The biology and chemistry is over my head (it has been a loooong time since taking those classes), but it is actually readable. Some items simply have to be taken on faith if you haven't got the background to fully comprehend everything. In other words, one does not have to understand 'redox equations' to get the content.I haven't tried her methods yet, but I am intrigued. It goes against most of my library, but she makes a lot of sense."
3,O.K. shooting glasses,"Fit is alright and they don't fog up. This color doesn't help with clays for me...even worse for birds. Still, they are probably adequate protection for normal range use and they are pretty comfortable."
3,amazon answer please,"Is this the ""Chopped Not Slopped"" version? It says it is but plays the regular speed version. I am looking for the ""Chopped Not Slopped"" version..."
4,Cute,"This is a sweet little movie that is of course suited for children. I collect children's books for their illustrations so thought this might be inspiring as well. It is a cute story about an aunt and her niece going on vacation and creating fairy dwellings together. The aunt, who is also the producer of the movie, sketches and works on her book throughout. It is because of this that it became a bit shameless in self promotion and that was a distraction for me. I think it would have been better to have given the gift of sharing fairy dwellings, the relationship between aunt and niece and left the self promo and ""advertising"" out, or maybe just inserted it at the end. I think it was beautiful to see the aunt drawing the little girl though."
3,"Disappointed--it's okay, but not exceptional.","This video is okay. It is nice to see a peaceful, wholesome movie for kids. But the filming could have been much better. It was very grainy, skipped around a lot, and most scenes lacked a clear focal point. It could have been very beautiful, but what I got most from the filming was how bad the ozone problem is in Maine. The storyline was a little weak as well."
3,Where the Fairys are.,"This is a charming ""real people"" story. I think it will do well for the 6-10 year olds.Great for letting children""s imaginations run and certainly sparks creativity!"
3,Great music - wrong CD,"I love the music, but after I started playing it on my computer I noticed that it was not the right CD. On my computer screen it showed ""Spirit Wind: Native American Flute Ensemble"". The artist is not David R. Maracle and the songs are completely different than what is on Spirit Flutes. This also happened on Spirit Journey which I received at the same time. I would never have noticed the difference if I had just played it on a regular CD player. Buyer beware."
2,I can hear him breathe,"I know this sounds bad, but I can hear him take a breaths when he is about to blow into the flute. I have another native flute CD and you can't hear that. It takes away from the music, I think."
2,Freaks out my cats.,"The music is too high pitched for me, but in any case it freaks out my cats. I'm guessing it's really too high pitched for them."
2,NeverKink? Is that a typo?,"I've owned this hose for about 6 months now and I wholeheartedly disagree with the name of this product. Why? Because it kinks. I use this a couple of times a week to water my potted plants and grass and this hose does not live up to its name. It kinks in multiple places and I would not buy this product again. I guess the positive about this hose is it's soft enough you don't feel like you are wrangling with a stiff piece of rubber, but on the flip side, it kinks. I would definitely not recommend this product and may be replacing it soon. My previous hose was a Swan and it lasted several years before I had any kinking problems with it. If you are looking at this piece of junk for a new garden hose, look to another product!"
4,No kinks and good coiling properties,"I hooked two together and use them on my lanai. So far, they coil back up nicely without twisting or kinking."
1,Never kink my a**,This hose kinks like all the others. I still have it after 2 yrs and it kinks as much now as it did the first week n don't waste your $$
5,Sturdy,"This is a sturdy hose, with thick tubing walls and solid brass fittings. It can kink under certain motions but not esaily -- call it kink resistant but not never-kink. My previous hose burst at a kink point, but this one seems much thicker and reinforced, and less likely to give way in that manner. I like using it just fine."
2,CHEAP HOSE with NO redeeming features .. KINKS and CHEAP,The hoses branded NEVERKINK are cheap hoses which are poorly made and use the same materials as the cheap ones sold at Wally World and the Orange Box Stores. Buy a hose on sale and save money or look elsewhere for a true high quality hose.
5,Great short hose,"This hose will NEVER kink for sure (it is very stiff though, I suggest putting it in the sun to start with just to get it to straighten out!) Perfect for a short hose and what I wanted it for. ""Might"" be hard to handle in longer lengths but for 25 ft it works perfectly."
1,Kinky in Summer - Stiff in Winter,"I've had this hose through summer 2007. It frequently kinks, it's heavy and difficult to straighten...and, coiling it is a real wrestling match...with the hose often ""winning"". Now that it's getting cold, the hose has stiffened to the point that I cannot put it on our hose reel. My Wife struggled with it for 30-minutes the other day, just to untangle it and make 3-foot coils on our front yard. When I find a new, better hose...I may GIVE this one away to someone I really dislike."
5,Never Kink Hose,"We just love our Apex NeverKink 2000 hose. What a joy it is to water the garden now, no more stopping to undo a kink. The hose lives up to its product description and thensome. We are going to buy another longer one next season, can't say enough about this product. High quality, reels in and out easily on our hose cart, the fittings are excellent, it is a product well worth the price, we've paid twice as much for a hose that can't hold a candle to this hose."
2,Did not work for me,"The product arrived bent in a few places. Which was suspicious as it is advertised guaranteed not to kink.I decided to install it anyways. One of the couplings could not hold the pressure and was leaking when Hose Nozzle was attached to it in the ""off"" position."
5,Perfect hose for a smaller yard,"My front yard is a beautifully landscaped smazller space, so the shorter hose is perfect. Appropriately named, this hose never kinks."
3,what's up,"it does kink,most of the time it is ok, the name is misleading, better than the non kink hoses, what a deal"
4,a hose is a hose,Wanted a 25 foot hose for a particular application. They are not easy to find always. This one seems fine.
1,Does so kink,"The Never Kink Hose does indeed kink. It's kinks are so well ingrained in the hose that I often can't get water through it. I'd just as soon buy a regular hose that doesn't purport to never kink and pay less. They guarantee a refund, which I'd like to receive."
3,"3 stars for durability, minus 2 stars for kinking & weight","I purchased this hose over a year ago. It began kinking last year but we use it for watering the garden at the front of the house so we were moving it constantly. One problem was that it is a heavy hose and crushed the plants we had to move it over. Before we had the curly hose that was lightweight but didn't last. This hose is still here but the kinks are most annoying. However, we left it outside all winter (although the spigot had a water supply the water was not turned on and we did drain the hose at last use). For the company to put NeverKink in the title is bogus since we are proof that this hose does kink."
2,Apex NeverKink 2000 5/8-Inch-by-100-Foot Heavy Duty Ultra Flexible Hose #8605-100,"I am sorry to say that this item kinks up more than a rattlesnake trying to get away from a coyote. After many years of using premium, life-time guaranteed rubber hoses from a huge retail company, I decided that I was tired of the black marks that were left on my concrete and bricks. I was aldo tired of the hoses kinking - no matter how I used them. Walla, I saw this and decided to try it. It does not leave black marks. That is good. Howver, it is very stiff and it kinks every bit as much as my premium rubber hoses. I do not recommend this item."
4,"Never say ""never.""","Reasonably good quality for a low price, but ""NeverKink"" is a slight exaggeration. I think shipping was free, a factor that means a big difference in price."
1,Never means Never!,"I bought three of these Never Kink hoses and they all kink! They kink just as much if not more that my regular hoses.Not sure what the companies definition is of Never, but never means never, not most of the time.Don't waste your money I'll sell you mine for half the cost."
1,"Should be called ""Insta Kink""","Bought the 50 foot length. Visually, the hose looked indestructible - nylon meshed reinforcement was visible in a ""reveal"" strip the entire length of the hose, and it felt very firm to the touch. All I do is water my flowers and vegetables, but I was hoping this puppy would last 20 years like my last hose.Uh...NOT!Last week, three months after purchase, a bubble appeared near the nozzle and got bigger and bigger like the cake in the old Little Rascals short. The next day it burst. Tomatoes very thirsty.Should have gotten suspicious when the hose diameter increased significantly under pressure, then went limp and blubbery when pressure was relieved.Hose name is hilarious. You could stare intently at this schnauzer from twenty feet away and make it kink.When I returned it to Home Depot the girl gave me no argument. Before I even began my spiel she waved me off.""We get a lot of these back"", she said."
1,Always Kinks is a better name,"I purchased the 'commercial' one for my greenhouse watering needs. Needless to say it went back to place of purchase. Constantly kinks. Buy a Gilmour you will be happier.Gilmour 10-58100 8-ply Flexogen Hose 5/8-Inch-by-100-Foot, Green"
1,bad news,This product has a very small warning label hidden inside the packaging That says warning do not drink from this hose and wash hands after use. It may contain lead and chemicals that can cause cancer and birth defects.just think of watering your animals or garden with this poison. It is not stated on the outside beware
2,Just another hose,"I don't understand the good reviews this hose got from other people. Maybe the product changed. Anyway, this hose is no better than any other hose I've owned. It kinks and twists just as easily, and does not seem to be of especially high quality. I'm still searching for the perfect, or even close-to-perfect, garden hose."
3,my amazon review,This item is very satisfactory and it is as described.I have enjoyed using this item for my planting that I doclose to my home and flower beds. It is ideal for this.
5,I Use Them For My Pool Fill,"I buy these Apex Never Kink 2000 Heavy Duty Ultra Flexible Hoses every year in the spring. The sun eats them here in Arizona, so they have to be replaced frequently. They are important to connect the pool fill in the backyard with the sillcock in the front yard where we have the automatic sprinkler controls. We time the pool fill to go on every day for about fifteen minutes when we're away on a trip. It works beautifully. The hoses don't let you down. Last summer we hooked up the assembly and it worked flawlessly while we were away for 76 days in Europe and driving back and forth across the United States from Tucson to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. Only now in late February of 2013 are we thinking about replacing them."
2,kinks like crazy!,"This is not a heavy-duty hose and it does kink. It kinks every time I use it. It's a simple garden hose. I have it connected to a faucet on my side yard. It's a small area so it's fine. But, it would be horrible if I used it anywhere else."
5,Made in the USA,This product does exactly what it says. It's high quality and thicker than my previous hose (which always kinked up at the wrong time!). I've used it daily and couldn't be happier. The fact that it's made in the US is a bonus. Thanks!
5,Great hose...,"I have had this hose for several years not and it is definitely the best hose I have ever purchased. Does not kink but the main thing is that it holds up well, even when left outside during the winter."
1,apex neverkink hose,"This hose kinked the first time I tried to use it... If returning it weren't such a hassle, it would go back..."
4,Very good 130-foot hose,I've owned this Apex 130-foot hose for three months now and am very satisfied with it. The quality is good and the 130-foot length is exactly what I needed.
2,This hose kinks constantly,This hose kinks constantly. I only bought it a month or so ago. It truly sucks but I'm giving it two stars because water comes out of it consistently.
3,Short otherwise good...,"UPDATE: Having used it all Summer, it does kink and often. Be sure not to store it with a twist or the twist will stay in the hose permanently and then start kinking more in that spot.The hose is good quality but short. I wanted a short hose for my purposes, but could have used another ten feet. The hose is not for drinking, it states so on the hose coupling and on the packing."
2,Kink proof is FALSE !!!,"Bought this hose because I was fed up with garden hoses that kink as you drag them around the yard....Well, this hose is not the solution....Mine kinks all the time in 2-3 different places....It is very heavy to pull around the yard....If it was not so heavy and cost so much to send it back ,,I would have returned it....Maybe I got a lemon,,but this hose IS NOT a ""never kink""....."
2,Feh,"It's a hose. And it DOES kink though perhaps if you jumped into your time machine and went back 40 years you'd see a hose that has a greater prediliction toward kinking. However, for the price etc., I really can't get that worked up about it either way....."
4,"nice hose, good price","I'm happy with this purchase. I wouldn't say it never kinks, but it's definitely better than a standard inexpensive hose. Its easy to wind without a reel, and not frustrating to unwind (it doesn't get fixed in its stored shape that it stays coiled up)."
3,nice shoe but narrow,"These shoes are very nice looking and seem to be made well, but they are very narrow and I do not have wide feet at all; I always wear a normal or medium width."
3,Cheap and simple,"This is a cute little book to share with children. It gives limited information on a small variety of birds. Considering it costs very little, it's worth the price. But, I wouldn't pay more than $1.50. I'm using it for a kids raffle table prize at our Bird Club."
2,"If you want to read about defacation, fornication, murder and death, this is the book for you...otherwise don't waste your time","Just icky. The humor, while dark, isn't even that funny. Yes, I agree with others, the ALL CAPS is annoying though you do get used to it. I give her credit for writing and getting this drivel published--more than most people have ever done. But the lists that meandered; the murdering of the old annoying ladies, while funny, was just mean; all the sex, oy; hell was interesting for a nanosecond, but move on already, we got it; and the suicides and rebirths--did she deserve it? I lost interest at that point and skipped to the end. I would have given one star but like I said earlier, at least she wrote it and got it published and all of us have read it. So two stars for Lucy and good luck in the future...maybe more structure and less caps next time?"
1,Do NOT buy,"The wind sensor worked for less than 5 minutes. I called La Crosse warranty. Actually reached someone the 2nd time I called. They said to return the whole unit to them and they would decide what was wrong. I packed the whole thing up in original box and sent it. They returned it in a shoe box, missing pieces. I have now called 4 times over 3 days (at different times of day, in case there is a peak at some time). Each time I get a recording that says ""Due to high call volume, please leave your name and number and we will call you back."" I have still not been called back. The only saving grace is that Amazon says it will give me a refund if I send the remaining pieces, no longer in the original box, to them.If you like trouble, deal with La Crosse."
5,Very high quality,The Leecraft RG-1 Zero Clearance saw insert for my Ridgid TS-3660 is of very high quality and fit perfectly in my saw. The leveling screws and the adjusting screws which make the insert fit tightly into the saw table allowed me to quickly get a very snug and level fit. The instructions are very clear and easy to understand. I would highly recommend this insert for any table saw user.
5,Leecraft Zero Clearance Throat Plate Ridgid TS3650,Worked as expected. Following the easy to read instructions was a snap and I was able to cut my plates safely and quickly. Would buy again.
1,outdated material,"This book was published in 1994, 9th edition. The Michigan Foundation Directory has just published it's 12th edition this month, 12/2000. As anyone who has written a grant knows, it's a case of ""you snooze, you lose"" and you can't get much snoozier than applying for a 6 year old grant. I gave one star because the program refused to take no stars."
5,HE DA BEST!,"Royce is the most under-rated MC out there, id give it 10 stars if i could. better than anyone you hear on your radio. I recommend bar exam 1 2 and 3. and get the album Street Hop too!"
5,banga,I've been listening to this joint and it is hot and if you kanow about royce you might want to check it out. I wonder if he is going to relase a full album because this is a mixtape
3,THE BAR EXAM,"This is Royce's best work to date. It's a good mixtape to promote his new album ""Street Hop"" even though i think this cd is better. Street Hop is a decent album as well. I first heard Royce on the Slim Shady lp and always thought that he had lyrical skill. I just think that his earlier albums are very weak before this one. Plus he loves to talk about how tough he thinks he is which is played out and gets old real fast. The bar exam shows that he is getting better as an artist and now he is rolling with Dj Premier. Which can never do anything but help out. Definitely worth checking out for any fan of Royce da 5'9"". A solid album for the most part."
3,"This was only ""okay""","The memoir of a ""hidden child"" who survived the Holocaust with the help of the Belgian Resistance, who hid her entire family in various safe houses throughout the war. Clara's mother and two of her three siblings survived, but her brother died in Auschwitz and her father was murdered. I haven't seen too many Holocaust memoirs out of Belgium. Unfortunately, this one isn't terribly detailed and it doesn't really stand out from all the other books I've read."
3,For the intellect only.,"This book was a disappointment to me. I purchased it because I was hoping it would speak to my heart. It was very interesting, however, not at all evocative. This is such a painful area for so many women. It's a shame the author got caught up in analyzing her patients instead of helping us to empathize with their wounds."
1,I think my time would been better spent doing the laundry.,"I found this book to be not only wordy but also unsatisfying. It was written on a level far above the average reader's vocabulary. The most complex subject can be explained to a very small child when sufficiently broken down. However, distraught daughters don't get that luxury in this journal. Instead their serious, heart wrenching troubles get likened to characters in movies, myths, and legends in words and phrases that are not familiar to the average person. The reality was left totally lacking. Then, as if to add insult to injury, there was little, if any, resolution to the breach and resulting vacuum felt in the hearts of many women. I was left feeling very unsatisfied after reading this book."
5,"Smart, realistic, and honest","What I loved about this book was that unlike so many other books on father-daughter relationships this one did not oversimplify. Too many other books try to blame the father or blame the daughter and to squeeze us all into clear, but inaccurate roles. Linda Schierse Leonard recognizes that we are not always the same, that we are all actors as well as acted upon, and helps make our choices and their consequences clear. Brava!"
5,great thriller,"My daughter received this as a gift from me for Christmas and she just loved it. she too is a big SRK fan, for him to play a villan in the movie is a nice change of pace"
4,It Works!,Installed drive in older computer and it works as described. Although it is a used part it is very good condition.
5,A Classic!,"I have taught letters, numbers and so much more on this plus the kids can scribble with no mess involved. Great toy!"
4,One of the better ones.,I have three different Etch-a-Sketch pads and this one is the only one that still is in good condition. Also this pen is really great for small hands!
3,VIEWS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR,"Blandford has a good technique in presenting views of both the Canadian and British attachers who landed on the Normandy shores, as well as those of the German soldiers defending their turf. The excerpts quoted by soldiers from both sides are excellent. Unfortunately, Blandford editorializes constantly about how clever ""Monty"" (Br. Gen. Montgomery) is and how incompetent the allied leaders (Ike, for example) are in relation to ""Monty."" Blandford praises the Germans more than the Americans, and allows that the Americans finally won because Monty wore out all the German SS armies containing him in his beachhead. Good quotes, but too much negative editorializing about the Americans."
3,Predictably britcentric viewpoint of the subject,"What is an excellent and underused technique of both German and British/Canadian soldier's accounts of unit actions is time and again reduced to petty whining about the American lack of ability. At some point it becomes so tiresome you can easily find yourself skipping the editorial and only reading the soldiers quotes.Thankfully, this will only shorten the book by 20% or so.Ike was a terrible battlefield commander, Patton was only a success due to Monty's and the British army's earlier sacrifices, etc, etc....ad infinitum.Ask the German's who opposed both who was a better general, Monty or Patton and I think you will get a more qualified answer than the author's, or mine for that matter."
2,One-sided view of two sides,"This book was a disappointment as I expected new information of the Allied side and the German side in Normandy. It is actually a discussion of what the Germans did and why everything that Montgomery did was exactly correct. The author then attacks the British military leaders who opposed Montgomery and supported a move to ""sack"" him after ""Operation Goodwood"". The Americans are mentioned only in passing in terms of ""naive"", ""not the student of war that Montgomery was"", and why Omaha was almost a disaster. There is the argument that Montgomery should have commanded the forces as Eisenhower was not a real General. Contrary to most accounts, the author argues that Montgomery did not suffer from a lack of British manpower. However, he does mentions the problems of trying to make infantry out of sailors and airmen."
1,Broken on 26 th screw,Broke 2 mm bit on the 26th screw. Metal screws that tighten into plastic. I was using bits with a black and decker 3.6v handheld screwdriver.
5,Highlights the major moments in human events,"Short History Of the World is anything but short, despite its title: well over four hundred pages covers world history for the last four million years, from pre-African roots to modern times. Considering the expanse of time covered, however, Short History Of the World could well be an abbreviated modern history, highlighting the major moments in human events and providing a lively coverage of facts."
2,FAST FOOD OF HISTORY,"No me impressionei com o livro...trata-se de uma especie de ""fast food"" de um livro de história...E para piorar, o autor, sendo australiano, discorre a história da evoluo humana de maneira bastante desiquilibrada....dando uma enfase exagerada e até irritante à Australia e Nova Zelndia, ao mesmo tempo que a America Latina é quase que completamente ignorada ao longo de todo o livro, regio do mundo que o autor obviamente desconhece por completo....Eu no recomendo o livro, no acrecenta muita coisa ao já lido em outros livros de história bem melhores...."
3,Neil Aspinall's son with Mona Best,"The story behind this book is one of the secrets in the Beatles tale. Neil Aspinall, who still works for the Beatles as director of Apple Corps, looking after their legacy and business interests, classmate of Paul McCartney's at the Liverpool Institute, was Pete Best's good friend. When the band needed someone to help them move their equipment from gig to gig, Neil was hired because he had a car. Throughout the band's story, Neil was the road manager.Neil lived with Pete's family for a while in the early years. He had an affair with Pete and brother Rory's hip, relatively young, Indian mother, Mona. They had a child together, Roag.When Pete was tossed out of the Beatles, he told Neil to choose between the job with the band and his living with the Best family. Neil chose the Beatles. He was not allowed to see his son grow up.This is that son's book."
5,Do people just write stuff they read on other websites?,"Several of the negative reviews contain misinformed information - the Beatles were friends of the Casbah owner Mona who was a significant reason for their success. First the house she purchased was bought on a horse race wager made with money from her pawned jewelry - it was a 33 to 1 bet in a win. Imagine if she had and the Casbah never came into existance.Second the Beatles hand painted each of the rooms in the Casbah. After playing there for several years to hundereds of fans - the final show had 1,500 fans trying to get in.The book is a great resource to a different side of the beginning of the Beatles."
4,"For beginners, this is a great deal for a dulcimer.","I am always skeptic about the irregularly low priced instruments, however when I picked one of these up, I was proven wrong. You might want to pick up some D'addario dulcimer strings because they usally don't come with good ones. That's what I did and it sounds pretty darn good to me."
4,Soldering problem.,I loved this kit. This is the 2nd purchase of this item. On both purchases some of the round places you solder came off the board. I would recommend using a lower heat on this board to help prevent it from separating from the board. Some troubleshooting may be required for this reason. Besides that it worked fine. I enjoyed putting it together with this exception. And it made my soldering look bad. Over all it was worth the purchase.
2,Disappointing entry in an excellent series,"This was one of the volumes in the History of the American Cinema series that I was most looking forward to, and while a good book it fails to measure up to the best in the series. Prince never seems to be able to offer the insight of Cook (in vol. 9) or the mastery of Koszarski (in vol. 3). I had hoped for more about an era that looms as large in the public imagination as that decade does, yet Prince is unable to meet the challenge."
2,A boatload of flatted 5ths.....,"Well, I guess I expected a lot more from this great bassist and Stick player. I have only listened to it once and I do not know if I will even give it another. Not up to his usual quality efforts. But, it is sort of cool if you groove on flatted 5ths and are not burned out on them."
4,Outstanding!,"Tony tears it up on this release. While Tony plays a number of instruments on this album, Pat Mastellotto is fabulous as always playing drums on most of the tracks. Rivers of Light is overall a more subdued piece than other songs, but this is a very strong release with no throw away tracks whatsoever. Can't wait to see Stick Men in October!"
4,Stick Man,"Stick man is o.k. just o.k., It is not as musical as Resonator, Stick man is deeply rooted in music fundamentals from/of King Crimson.I'm rating this effort a four star, after a soild week of listening to the album.C.T."
1,Note - NOT FOR IMACS!,"I should have paid more attention when ordering. This does not work on the iMac, it's not USB. I had to buy another one. Sigh."
1,A waste of time and talent.,In a word - woeful. How James Brolin and Ian Somerhalder took on this project is beyond me. A waste of their talent.The script is very poor and the special effects are just terrible. Sound is front centered - not 5.1 as advertised. Rental only!
2,Not what I was looking for,"I work at a treatment center for emotionally disturbed children. I was looking for dolls for play therapy. These looked good because they were not character driven (not something seen on TV like iCarly, Barbie, ... ect) and they had basic family members represented. I also liked them because they had multiple sets representing multiple ethnic groups. When I got them I found out that the bodies were small hard blocks of wood. I did not think this would be good for my purpose so I sent all three sets back. I was disappointed but will keep looking..."
3,not what I was expecting,"I was under the impression that these were banquet plates, i.e. luncheon-sized. They turn out to be hors doerves plates, which is fine. But not what I wanted and I don't think they were well described."
5,Excellent Advice on Saving Time!,"Moskowitz has written an excellent title on different ways to eliminate the unnecessary clutter and techniques that rob us of precious time.Now to save you some time, I will briefly mention some the topics covered in the book:1. How to best use your garbage can (didn't they tell us the computer age was suppose to eliminate paperwork?!).2. How to arrange the items in your office.3. Getting control of your telephone.4. Confirm appointments to save time.5. A different plan for the homemaker or professional.6. How to avoid unwanted meetings.7. 5 easy ways to say no.Now that I've saved you time by writing a short review, go get the book and read to find out how you can save more time!Highly recommended!"
5,The 'lone star',"'tis a vey precious guide to Texas expressions and euphemisms!If you're in love with american language and culture, ya gotta have it! Right now!!"
4,Warm and ...,"We bought this for our 6 lb. Chorkie who seems to enjoy it. It is a little bigger than I expected, but that left room for a little blanket. I agree that it is likely to be easy to clean, but there has been no need yet. I like that the removable pad has a velcro patch that keeps it in place without being a pain to attach; it's quite small, but does the job. Shipping was fast; item arrived ahead of it's proposed delivery date."
5,Remastered jewel,"I'm a Cockburn completist and bought the remastered record for that reason alone. Not being one of my favorites, this album had seen little play. Now however, with the addition of the two bonus tracks ('The Coldest Night of the Year' and 'The Light Goes On Forever') this record is in frequent rotation in my player. 'Loner' is a look into Cockburn's mind with gorgeous violin embellishment by Hugh Marsh. 'Justice' is as timely and pointed now as it was when it was written in the 80's. 'The Light Goes On Forever', dropped from the original record to trim length, is the 'new' gem here. It contains some of Bruce's best poetry of his entire career. It is sung rather than spoken, as much of his more recent stuff."
5,One of His Best!!,"Bruce's work continues to startle my spirituality. He is one of a kind. He remains spiritual, but appears to shun the convention part of religion. This is good. He tells it like it is but keeps the love of Jesus Christ in his heart. What a fine and beatiful line he walks. Good job Bruce!!Other CD Recommendation...""Songs from the 49th Parallel"" by KD Lang.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"""
1,The Best of Slovak Cooking,"If the author thinks this is the best of Slovak cooking he has not eaten great Slovak food. Sorry, I consider this book a waste of money."
2,not very good,"This is not the best cooking book I have ever seen, there are not pictures at all, and some meal might be particular to the authors area in slovakia , the introduction starts with saying from slovak people, which is unknown from my girlfriend who is slovak... When I read this book, I felt like it was written very quickly, it does not seems to be written from someone who got the receipies from his grandmother. However, it gives a good overview of what they eat, I recommend the cabage soup, mnam !!!"
5,Absolutely hilarious,"Even though I've been out of college for a couple years, I checked this book out and it is such a hilarious account of the collegiate laziness experience that I had to buy it. Many parts have literally made me laugh out loud. It's the first book I've ever seen that speaks in the language of our generation, filled with Simpsons references, Fast Times at Ridgemont High references, etc. It's too bad it wasn't out when I was in school--- I really could've used it, not only for its killer tactics, but for its sheer hilarity!"
3,Light Oak...more like unfinished oak,"This is a nice grouping, but the wood is described as Light Oak Finish Wood. It's actually more like *unfinished* wood. I really like the style and it was relatively easy to put together, but the quality of the wood itself and the finish are not what I expected. If you buy these tables, just make sure you don't let children around them with anything that stains...it will be a part of the finish *forever*! I refinished the tops myself to add a more protective coating."
4,Great GPS with PDA functions,"I recently bought this item. The GPS functions are great but take a little getting used to. Your can plan a trip and the PIN 570 will tell you where to turn and quite cleaverly if you decide to take a different rout it will re compute the rest of the journey after warning that you have deviated from planned rout. It can be set to avoid toll roads and for varous ather settings.As well as GPS devive its a regular PDA with adress, phone numbers, games and other utilities that run under Winsows Mobile."
3,Decent PDA/GPS For a very decent price,"I like the Navman, for the price, and the features you get. I did find, like the other writer did, that it can take some time to acquire the GPS signal, sometimes. Usually, when it does have a delay, it's like 2 to three minutes. I've never experienced anything close to an hour.It can be somewhat cumbersome to enter addresses, but, overall, I think it's a great little gadget.Also, to the writer who stated that the pegs are in the wrong place on the cradle for the unit? Those pegs are actually adjustable, so you can slide them to where you need them."
5,Cam Seals,"These are the cam seals for the 2.2L SOHC Subaru. I installed them on a '97 Legacy. Amazon's system says they do not fit my car, but they do. Fel-Pro quality for less money; thanks Amazon!"
5,It is an excellent book for novice in Vedic astrology.,David has done an excellent job. He has explained vedic [Hindu] astrology in a very simple way. Well I really do not have many words to express the work he has done.Well done David.......keep it up.
4,A lot of information,"I am new to Vedic astrology, but this book has really captured it's essence and given me a good perspective into it. It is so cluttered with the amount of important issues that need to be covered it kind of leaves me in the dust, wondering if I missed the green light telling me when to go. Not only that I am to understand this only covers so much and that there is even more to learn, i.e. Nakshatras, ect. Apart from the devastating amount of inspiration I get from just reading this book, I feel I will read it again to fully understand what this book offers on this subject, before reading other books on this topic."
2,The view is too small; you can not see much of anything.,"We intend to use this periscope inside a toy cardboard house we built for the kids. The plan is to bore a hole in the middle to place the periscope so they can see outside from inside the box. Sounds fun? Not exactly. The view is too small. When you look into it, you can only see an area the size of a single face in it. They should make this wide angle view. It is too hard to find and see anything, like looking for a tiny airplane up in the sky using a peephole. Not really worth it.Construction is fine. It is a piece of telescoping plastic pipe than extends to 14"". But at least it would help if it is more functional than this."
2,"Poorly made, cheap plastic",My son paid a lot of his allowance money on this and it was poorly made junk.. Yes I guess it did it's job but the picture you see is tiny and we were expecting something a little better quality.
3,Gift,Don't know yet if my grandson will like this. The package arrived damaged (plastic separated from cardboard backing) but I will tape it. It is overpriced though.
3,Protects well,"This hard cover works very well for me. It protects the PalmPilot and I've never had a problem with it. The only thing that I don't really like is that I have to remove the cover and snap it on the back, do my writing, then pull the cover off the back and slide it back on the front. A lot of work - a flip cover or zippered case would be easier. But for the price, this is good."
4,Grandson loved it!,"As with the other Mercer Mayer books, this one is a winner. My kids loved Little Critter and now so do my grandkids. :>"
5,Excellent book and series.,"Me and my kids are continuously buying more books from this collection. Books are short (no boredom here), very comical in a clean way. Lessons are morals are taught throughout the book which is lovely. I recommend this for all kids under 12. We read these over and over again. A winner in our house."
5,Very witty story^_^,"I bought this book for my little baby and I had never bought any of the little critter books before so I wasn't sure what it would be like. But this is a fun book, with a little critter that just doesn't want to go to bed (just like my little critter :D).It has a nice narrative and wonderful illustrations which make it a fun to read to my little guy and which is easy enough that he can read himself once he is old enough."
5,Love it!,"We love all the little critter books. They are always so colorful and fun to read. We also add a little more fun by trying to find the frog, spider and mouse on each page. In some of the books there is just the spider, in some it is just the mouse, and in others it is both. Sometimes there is a frog and a grasshopper too. They are hidden a lot of the time and it is fun to try to search them out. We especially love this one."
5,My kid's favourite!,"Mercer Mayer is a genius. Her books are written simply and my 2 year old identifies with them. She loves the stories and the pictures; they stimulate her imagination! She picks up her ""Little Critter"" books each night and asks for them to be read without fail. Just like the Little Critter, my daughter has all kinds of excuses for not going to bed, so she loves this one especially."
5,A wonderful book for children to read before going to bed!,"I think the book Just Go To Bed is an all time, every kids favorite, book to read. It really gets them into the spirit of going to bed. This book is a great book to read and is fun for children."
1,Just Act Out,"I'm not a big fan of any of the Little Critter series, but this one is first to go in the recycle bin.Little Critter doesn't want to go to bed, so he contrives a series of delightful examples of how to ignore a parent's requests and get away with it. As with a lot of books in the series, it climaxes with hostility & shouting, and it ends with Little Critter falling asleep, shown ultimately that his strong feelings were pointless.The lesson: it's funny to act out, but a child's grand conception of things is foolishly wrong. That is the opposite of how our family sees childhood and parenthood. I get the point that this series validates a child's sometimes antisocial feelings, but this one (especially) also validates bad behavior on the part of the child and the parent."
2,Just Go To Bed is just OK,"I'm a huge fan of Mercer Mayer's books and they are always a huge hit around the house except for this one. This was is about the little one doing just about anything not to go to bed by pretending to be and do various things, with the father just replying ""Just go to bed"", nothing more. I felt it was very outdated in that the father just barks orderes and no explainations or further communication. I guess I expected the book to have the parent explain or demonstrate in a crafty way why it is important for wee ones to rest or prepare for bedtime. Nothing of the sort here. This book is a dud in my opinion with so many missed opportunities to educate and amuse children and parents. You can find much better books out there to help with bed time rituals."
2,Get it if it's on MAJOR sale,"This gift was given to my 6 month old as a Christmas gift. The Fold and Go Kick Gym is rather awkward to opperate, and if your baby figures out where to kick, she may kick it clear across the floor since there is really no traction with it. My baby played with it a few times by flicking the plastic birdies to make music, and then quickly lost interest. If it's on discount you may wish to try it, but there are much better toys in this price range."
1,Wouldn't recommend it!,"My daughter tried out another kick toy at a friend's house, so I decided to get her this one for our home. I liked that it folded up and stored easily, but that ended up being the only real benefit! Though she was mildly interested in it, you have to kick it REALLY HARD to get it to make any noise. It was really a waste of money. I ended up getting her another kick toy by Fisher-Price that converted into a piano that she could stand at when she got older. Sorry, I wish I could remember the name of it..."
1,Hate It,"I absolutely hate this product. My father bought it for my daughter when she was about 2 months old. She hated it then. So I packed it up and to see if she liked it when she got older. So around 4 months old I unpacked. She hated it then. But I kept trying it with her, hated it the whole time. And it wasn't only her that hated, my nephew who is about the same age as my daughter hated it. It was to loud and scared my nephew and my daughter had a hard time getting anything to work."
3,Fold and Kick Gym,"I received this at my baby shower for my son. It looked very cute from the box. My son never was very interested in it and when he would play with it, it wasn't for very long. The baby has to kick pretty hard in order to activate the sound.I thought the birds moved when it was activated as well but, I came to find out that they don't. The baby has to kick them in order to make them move. This toy just doesn't have a lot to offer."
3,it's ok,"My son bent the hanging birds, the babies couldn't really kick it right, although when they did the loved the lights and sounds, and the music was pleasant, not annoying like a lot of toy. But there are better kick toys out there."
4,A great & inexpensive toy!,"My 2 1/2 month old son's daycare has this toy and they lay him in a playpen with it and he just kicks and kicks! He just loves it and it doesn't go anywhere because it is against the side of the playpen. He loves anything with lights and when he is happy he kicks his feet, so it is perfect for him!"
1,DANGEROUS TOY!,"We don't have the portable version of this toy, but the non-portable version functions exactly as the one here, so I wanted to alert people. Here's what I submitted to the Consumer Product Safety Commission about it: ""What happened is one of my son's feet (he is 12 weeks old) would slip underneath and to the side of the spring board, while the other foot would kick the spring board, crushing the first foot between the board and the side of the gym and floor. It caused no lasting injury, however he would scream out in obviously intense pain that would subside after a minute or two. This happened on two consecutive uses of the gym before we figured out what happened (First use we just thought something just scared him - didn't see the incident. Then we watched him closely on second use and discovered the problem)."" This toy should be completely recalled!"
1,"BORING, a piece of crap!","I was looking for the original kick start gym, with a thick footplate that when baby kicks, the motors turn and music plays. Unfortunately, they don't make those anymore and I made the mistake of buying this. We tried to weight it down but if my daughter kicks it, it either moves away or falls over, she hates it! Luckily, I found the original kick start gym on ebay and she has happily kicked it for hours since she was 2 months and she's almost seven months now!"
1,This is often at thrift stores.,"I had this toy and didn't like it. It was often knocked over on top of my 4 lb triplets! When they were older they simply kicked it too far away to play with.I see this toy CONSTANTLY at used baby clothes stores and garage sales, and thrift stores. More than any other toy. I know, when we have a toy we really like, we store it for the next baby or give it to someone who we know. People usually just want to see this item gone."
3,My baby likes this gym more than others,"My baby got 3 gyms as gifts and she likes this one the most. Its true that its light and if the baby kicks again and again, it can move. But I place it against a wall and then its quite secure.At first my baby didn't know what to do with it. So I used to turn on the music and she was happy to see the lights. I taught her to hit it and when she learned it, it became her favorite toy. She would spend nearly 30 min in it at a time or until her legs become tired. She got so hooked to it that when I put her in the other gym (with only hand pulled toys) or her bouncer seat, she would kick her legs and get upset because no music would start. She is 7 months old and I still use this gym occasionly. Now she can play with the gym with her legs while playing with another toy with her hands.It only has small lights, but frankly my baby didn't care. She was more interested in the sound. It has no frills and other features, but for an infant it is pretty ok."
1,not a very good toy to play with,"we got this as a gift for our dd. she didn't have any interest in it at all. even after she learned how to kick it...it didn't stay in place long enough for her to keep kicking it. also, you had to really hit it hard in order to get it going. the music was very loud and annoying. the first time she heard the music it scared her. the only plus side to it is that it can fold up nicely and be put away. definitly not worth to buy. i'm glad i got this as a gift and didn't buy it."
2,Frustrate 'N Go,"What a great idea for baby, but what a lousy product! Unfortunately there were no reviews on this product when I put it on my three-month-old son's wish list. He's been kicking up a storm, so I thought this would give him some reward for his activity. But you practically have to be a dexterous body builder to get the thing to play the music. My husband and I took a few tries to get the toy to reward us - and that's using our hands. Our baby is pretty strong, but only rarely has kicked the toy hard enough to make it ""go off"". And rarely is not often enough for him to understand the cause and effect. (especially when it plays random music occasionally anyway). Also, it is not sturdy. It wobbles backwards sometimes when you kick it. It needs to be bottom-heavier, especially when it requires such hard pressure to start the reward song.If I get the guts up, I may ask my in-laws for the receipt. Otherwise, it's into the closet."
5,TROUBLE RUNS IN THE FAMILY,"WES IS A BED MAN ON THE RUN AND NOW HIS LUCK IS OUT. CHASED BY THE POLICE AND TOTALLY BROKE, HE IS FORCED TO SEEK REFUSE AT THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH - HOME. BUT WITH HIS MOTHER DEAD, YOUNGER BROTHER CLIFF IS THE ONLY FAMILY LEFT. SO WES AND HIS BLONDE GIRLFRIEND RUBY TAKE SHELTER IN SUBURBIA, CRASHING CLIFF'S SAFE LITTLE WORLD."
3,Dirty Harry Meets Film Noir,"""Sudden Impact"" (1983) attempts to blend the traditional Harry Callahan crime thriller with a film noir story centering on a vengeful rape victim. The results never quite gel, yet Clint Eastwood's direction is sharp and stylish - certainly preferable to the made-for-TV sloppiness of 1976's ""The Enforcer."" Hugely abetted by Clint's immortal ""Make my day"" line, ""Sudden Impact"" became Dirty Harry's biggest box-office hit (though no match for the 1971 Don Siegel original)."
3,This is the first Dirty Harry Movie I've seen!,"The beginning of the film is excellent. It portrays Harry's anger over the city's crime and corruption. But as the story unfolds, we get less good character development about Dirty Harry and a disturbing, unpleasant predictable tale of revenge concerning Sondra Locke's character. Her and her sister were raped and she is out for revenge."
3,"""Why don't you guys go suck some fish heads""?","Dirty Harry is back, and with some of the best quoteable quotes in the series. However, this third sequel is overlong, sometimes unpleasant, and doesn't have that Dirty Harry ""feel"" to it. Harry is tracking a female serial killer (Sondra Locke) who's knocking off all those who participated in the gang rape of her and her sister years before. Some of the thugs are genuinely despicable and Eastwood is very watchable here. But it's basically a vehicle for Locke, his then girlfriend. Dirty Harry returned to form in 1988's ""The Dead Pool."""
2,Go Ahead and get rid of Sondra Locke and make OUR day (forever) Clint,"(Two-and-half-stars out of four on normalrating scale) [Really, the rating may seema bit harsh, as I do like Dirty Harry(more even than the real man behind him,Clint Eastwood, who by the time I typedin this review, 2006, has long since soldout to big brother, unfortunately)Storyline is good and ""Make my Day"" sceneis one of best ever in Eastwood film, butstupid subplot of Locke's character and sis'rape story saps plot. Albert Popwell back forfourth consecutive D.H. picture, this time as'Horace', Callahan's partner. Cute bulldog,too. Dirty Harry movies are either too longor short. A Pity... Pat Hingle is good too,until he's ""offed' by some of the worst punksever to cross Dirty Harry Callahan!"
4,The Eastwood / Locke Team,"By now you either like Sandra Locke or you don't. As a guy, I think she is kinda sexy. I like the story line. I would recommend this movie for watching. I collect everything Eastwood."
4,Make my day,"This movie shot that saying into the mainstream, even though it isn't the first movie to say it, it is famous because of the way it is delivered by Eastwood. This movie was almost like a gift for Eastwood's then girlfriend Sondra Locke. He cast her because this is the first and only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood directed. Locke is a woman who was raped years ago by a bunch of creepy men and one messed-up lesbian who is back and is looking for a little classic movie revenge. Eastwood is called on to solve these puzzling murders that Locke is doing. Eastwood then starts falling for her and he doesn't know she is the killer that he wants to bring to justice. Funny, violent, and well thought out are the best words to describe this classic movie."
5,A Great Read!,"You do not have to be a New Yorker to like Jonathan Mahler's ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning."" I live in the rural South, and really loved the book. Anyone who loves baseball, history, politics, New York, the late 1970's, or just good writing will thoroughly enjoy this book.My wife and I both loved this book. I am old enough to remember what we in Georgia thought of the Big Apple in that critical year of both bad news and hope. To know how the various story lines actually played out only enhances the fun of knowing what a mess things were in 1977."
3,not so good,Mahler writes for a magazine and he doesn't make any accomodation for a longer project. Pretty thin presentation.
4,interesting neo-conservative perspective,"Cities in America were coming apart in the late 1960s and 1970. Areas previously and still inhabited by working class whites were being burnt to the ground, house by house, block by block. Considering the magnitude of what happened, it is a curiously undocumented period in American history. So this is a brave book, in that it attempts to document some of what happened in this period. However it is written from a neo-Conservative perspective. If you really want to understand why America came apart, I recommend reading an exploding bombshell of a book called ""Culture of Critique""."
2,so-so,"It didnt focus on the yankees as much as i thought it would, and when it did, most of it was about Reggie. All the events of that summer were interesting and I remembered a lot of it happening too which was cool."
5,An Excellent Book,"This book is amazing. Aside from being a baseball book, it is more of a history book on NYC covering one of its most turbulent eras: the late 1970's. While touching upon the Son of Sam Murders, the controversial mayoral election, the blackout/riots and the great and crazy 1977 yankees, the reader gets a great overview of the city at that point in time. Of course, the yankees, with all their nuttiness were the shining light of hope for all New Yorkers those years.I highly recommned this book to all New Yorkers. I also highly recommned watching the miniseries about this era as well. You will not be disappointed."
5,1977,"This book brought back memories from my youth growing up in New York city at that time. It also enlightened me in that I did not realize how big of a year 1977 was for New York. I felt at times using the Yankees was a stretch but being a huge Yankee fan then it did not bother me, but may bother others."
2,Strong smell of melting plastic.,"As other reviewers have noted, it is somewhat larger than expected. I personally appreciate that it is larger, as I cook many big meals (this is actually great for salads too). However, this pasta fork stinks. Literally.Every time we have used it it while cooking, even with light use on recently cooked hot pasta, it let off a noticeable smell of burning or melting plastic. We no longer use this item while cooking for fear we are contaminating our food, and have switched to wood or steel forks for pasta, depending on the pot being used.We get some use out of this now and then for cooled foods which is why I left this review at 2 stars, but for the little use we get out of it, it's not worth the price we paid.I would suggest taking a pass on this item. Nylon and vinyl cooking utensils are rapidly falling out of favor for safety reasons. If you are using steel pots for your pasta, just use a steel fork. If using non-stick pots, try out bamboo or silicone."
1,HUH???,"Never Received! This has been from many years ago, all this is from long ago! Still I've not received this."
4,Good product,"I've owned this product for some months now. It works well, the teeth are well spaced, and it's durable. A good spaghetti fork, though somewhat over sized."
2,"I'm sorry, the book is very poor to be used for A+.","This book is very poor to be used for A+. The flow of sentense in the main text book is not organized well. The author puts too much verbose, unnecessary, words to explain objects; what is that light-minded, lazy description about USB? As well, the book is not technically witten; it even does not differenciate Low, Full, and High speed mode of USB. What is worse is that the optional book ""Practice Questions"" has full of wrong answer keys as you can see in the other customer reviews. I am very discouraged reading this book because of errors the book contains. The next time the author edits the A+ book, I wish him and co-workers to re-read the contents several times with experts and technical writers."
2,I failed both tests with this,I got this book and was able to answer all of the practice questions in the book correctly. I took both A+ tests last week and failed both. It was my first time taking the tests so go figure. I think I need more hands on and a bigger more expansive study book.
3,Needs Improvement,"I read this book from front to back and found several mistakes--answers that were confusing or incorrect. It was called to the author/publishers attention and only a few of the initial mistakes were corrected. I am still waiting on the remainder of the errata to be corrected. It does cover a great deal of what you would expect to be on the test and the explanations, when they were correct, were helpful."
2,"Good review, too long and many errors","Though the book is a good review, it seems to jog wildly off topic for a typical exam cram. My idea of an exam cram is just the information you need to pass the exam. I'm not interested in a history lesson of PC technologies or in-depth discussions of signalling that isn't covered on the exam and isn't used except by hardware engineers.Secondly, there are many errors, particularly the wireless section which has some serious errors. For example, the book says that 802.11b uses FHSS and 802.11g uses DSSS. This is clearly false. 802.11b uses DSSS, and 802.11g uses OFDM. There are no excuses for these types of errors."
3,Basically decent but get other material too,"I just took and [barely] passed my A+ Hardware and OS exams and this book certainly helped but it's not enough. The test asks many questions not covered in this book. I can't recommend an alternative since I haven't reviewed all the literature, but I believe I only passed because I happen to be a Macintosh technician who has encountered PC/peripheral/network problems over the years.This book is repetitive and does have some mistakes. In some places, the author says there is only one correct answer to a question, but in the explanation, says that there are several. The explanations sometimes contradict the answers. This can be frustrating as you would need another book to confirm the information in this one.Overall, the book is fine, but I would suggest supplementary reading or testing websites."
5,"Excellent, useful information for musicians!","I am preparing to release my sophomore album in a couple months and these CDs helped me tremendously in organizing my CD release party. There is so much helpful information that I couldn't think of on my own because I keep forgetting that I am a businesswoman *and* a musician. It even has individual tracks for easy reference. I definitely recommend this to anyone planning on releasing a CD, which is almost every musician out there who is serious about their music."
5,Re: CD Release Party Strategies Audio,David Hooper's audio on CD Release Party Strategies is a must have for emerging and established artists who want to launch their CD Release successfully. I received my copy of David Hooper's audio just less than a week before my actual CD Release Event. At that point David's advice guided me through last minute preparations and check points to insure that my special event ran smoothly. The interview with Disc Makers was fantastic and very inspirational to those of us who wish to remain independent artists.Barrie Z. of www.barriemusiconline.com
1,THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!,"Do not buy this item! It sucks! I bought Mondo Magic, and it was crazy wild real interesting and really shocking. But this package is terrible I could barely watch it, not because it was sickening but because it was so stupid and boring.I give this negative a million stars."
3,Ehhhh.,"When I first bought these shoes I had a problem with the back of them irritating my heal...over time (like 3 weeks) I finally got them worked-in and they bothered me no longer.November comes along, and I can't take them out in the snow because water or moisture somehow gets inside the sole and makes my feet feel damp and the fabric inside soggy.They're cute shoes, don't get me wrong, but I don't like that they're ""seasonal."" ...other than those few problems, they're fairly comfortable shoes."
3,had higher expectations,"I really had high expectations for this season, based on other reviews I read. In my opinion the season takes of slowly and the actors seem a bit ""rusty"".I also missed the thrill I still had in season two whenever an algorrythm was found to come to a solution. Now it feels like: There's a problem, don't worry, we have a pill (algorrythm) for it! It has become routine.Four stars for Louis Diamond Phillips and Judd Hirsch - I enjoy both characters very much. Don't know what the infamous Millie should accomplish. Hopefully the forth season will pick up the slack."
2,All about Amazon video player....not at all about Numb3rs,"Wanted to watch the full episode, however no matter what I do, the trailer keeps playing and I can't get it to play the episode. This is the first time it has ever happened and it's incredibly annoying.Numb3rs itself is something I've always enjoyed. It's definitely a typical network mini-series show, designed to entertain and predictable, but I still enjoy it very much."
1,More bad propaganda,"As someone who is neutral religiously, I'm quite sick of the episodes that are blatant propaganda. once again another episode that is sending out the message that Islam = violence and terrorism. The writers need to do more research on the subject. Terrible episode."
4,"A unique episode, random, but unique","What was entertaining about this episode was the effect Charlie has had on Megan, in that she has begun to use (or at least it is most obvious in this episode) concepts out Charlie's book. I could definitely see her thinking paralleling Charlie's when he tackles problems, but her approach was more systematic, more like the average person would approach it. Charlie seems to go from 0-60 in his thinking and while he is exceptional at explaining his ideas to a lay person, it is nice to see a slowed down approach to the problem. It was also fun to see Megan seeing the patterns when Charlie doesn't.Oh and Charlie and Don talk about everyone's love lives. As if we watch the show for their love lives, or lack thereof.This was just an off beat episode that partly turned the standard Num3rs formula on it's head."
4,Love it!,"I am loving this. I can get anybody watching this. It's interesting and realistic. The characters are interesting and co-exist in this reality perfectly. Great cast, great story line."
5,TV DVD,"It's ""Numbers"" what can I say? Working my way to collecting the whole set. Only Cold Case (not available, unfortunately...because of the music copyright mess) is anywhere near touching how great Numbers was-- and still is."
4,Pretty Much Love Numb3rs,"This season is really good. I don't know much about cinematic or screenplay so I will assume those are just as good. The tension between Don Eppes and his brother Charlie Eppes was also much better this season, their closeness to each other, and even then their relationships with the other characters. Such as, Charlie's relationship with Amita, and Don's on/off again relationship with Special Agent Lizz. However,I feel that the loss of Larry throughout most of the season was a terrible loss So I marked down a star."
5,The NUMB3RS series just keeps getting better and better!,Numb3rs - The Third SeasonIn season three we see Charlie with a new haircut. There are some very unique story lines in this season. At then end of the season we find out that one of there own is not who they seem to be. It was a truly great buy.
5,A true television series,"After watching the first two seasons, i became hooked on it right away.For me, i have learned to accept the fact that there are very unconventional ways in solving crimes today. Although numb3ers is fiction, it lets us know that we must be open to new ways to combat crime."
4,good show bad disk,"Numb3rs - The Third SeasonI bought two copies of Numb3rs season three and found the first disk to be defective on both. I bought a copy for myself and a friend and found both copies had a bad fist disk, the menu wouldn't play on either DVD player and I would get a preview for Twin Peaks and SOMETIMES the first episode of Numb3rs, if it didn't freeze at the end of the previews, then it would jump to the first episode. It never played past the first episode, just giving me a black screen.I could watch the whole disk on my computer by bypassing the menu and going directly to the episodes, something my DVD player won't do. So buyer beware, once is accident, twice isn't. I own seasons 1 and 2 had no problems with them. I loved the show and even with the defect in the disk, I recomend this series strongly. I give the series five stars but the disk brings it down one.Richard Robinson Springfield,Ohio"
1,Nothing funny here,I don't know what book you people read but the one I read wasn't funny in the slightest. It was nothing.
5,A different take on most Westerns.,"Ok this is not your run of the mill Western. But the storyline of the three widows/sister-in-laws and their situation and mishaps, is so different that it worked. This a shoot'em up, action filled ruthless Western with a very dark humorous side. A Little House on the Prairie it is not. More on the lines of Deadwood. But what made this unique was the main story is about three completely different but very determined women, all out of their element. I love watching Westerns, but rarely add them to my collection. This one I purchased. If you loved the series Deadwood I think you will enjoy this one. If you thought Deadwood was too raw you might want to pass on this Western."
1,Painful etc etc....thank goodness for the scenery,I love a GOOD western...have seen many.This film gives westerns a bad name.I could go on but I won't as a couple of other reviewers are bang on.
2,I should have known,I should have known that when the seller said this movie was a former rental that this movie was going to be cut to pieces. its only a little bit over an hour and the sex scenes are hardly worth it being cut as they are. Why? would you cut a movie that's only simulated sex anyway.
4,Captian Hook,This was very cool. I thought Dustin Hoffman played a great Captain James Hook. The only part I think could have been clearer was Hook's past.
4,Absolutely gorgeous music!,"Anyone who's seen the movie will most certainly love this soundtrack -- even if you haven't seen it John Williams musical genius can still be appreciated. This soundtrack is a bit unusual for him, as it has some vocal tracks, but they fit well with the rest of the CD. The track ""You are the Pan"" is my favorite piece of music ever - it leaves me in tears. He has a couple great swash-buckling sections, which are slightly reminiscent of Star Wars. However, I remember more of the pirate music in the film, and it's lacking a bit in the CD. Overall, the music is extremely moving and worth every penny. It is long too, which is a bonus. Buy it!"
5,The best soundtrack ever written!!!,"I have nearly all soundtracks of the best composer ever, John Williams, and this one is (technically, musically) his very best!!!"
5,Pure Magic,"Absolutely one of those most elegant pieces of music you will ever hear. As Steven Spielberg himself has said, this score will sweep you away to your own neverland. The score itself can really stand on it's own. Sit back, put your feet up and let the music sweep you away."
4,About as good as the movie was....,"If you enjoyed Hook the movie, the soundtrack will be equally entertaining. The score is fun and light most of the time, with a few ""dramatic"" (more like poking fun at dramatics if you ask me) parts, such as ""You are the Pan"" and ""Remembering Childhood."" My favorite tracks are ""Introducing the Hook"" and ""The Ultimate War;"" they are a lot of fun, with Peter's and Hook's themes going back and forth at each other."
4,Fascinating acct of a woman's part-time residence in France,"This book is a fascinating account of one (single) woman's experience in living abroad. She lives in Eastern US, and buys a residence in the south of France where she spends part of each Fall and Spring. Her account of her experiences, meeting of nieghbors, and general adventures provide an interesting read. I was saddened to learn the author died in 1996; in fact, before the book was published. Anyone know what happened to her? Please write Peter_and_Carole@msn.com. Thanks, and you'll enjoy this book"
4,I want this life,"I want this woman's life. I want her house in France. Probably the main reason I enjoyed this book so much is that I romanticize France to death. If you do, too, then this book is recommended to you!"
4,Falling in love with France,"Ann Barry's vignettes about her life in France are a gift to those of us who dream of living a more simple life. Tales of home improvements, neighbours, and regional idiosyncracies are enchanting and triumphant. As Ann discovers the pleasures of owning a home in France, so does the reader. I recommend this book to anyone who loves France, experiencing new cultures, and opening their mind to possibiliites beyond those we are taught. BTW - I understand she died from cancer."
3,"Reliable storage, but...","I use this device for more than a year. Overall, I saved about 40 times by 512MB of photos. It always copied data without any problem: in different temperatures, humidity, on bumpy roads. Fully charged battery was enough to backup 3-4 512MB cards in a couple of days.I found though that the small USB connector is the least reliable part of Wolverine device. After some time it started to give me problems to connect and finally its internal part went off completely. It happened when I was far away from home. I spent a lot of time looking for a photo store and burning CDs instead of taking pictures.Now I'm trying to figure out my options where to repair it, since a manufacturer [...]brings me to the famous B&H; Photo site.If you want to use Wolverine longer than me be very gentle when connecting USB cord."
5,A True Classic,"In spite of the forgoing lenghty review it is plain from the reading that this is a timeless and helpful book. In fact, each of the other authors the former reviewer so values, above Schaeffer, have each qouted and praised him for his excellent work."
4,Schaeffer is a true 3-dimentional thinker...a great book,"Francis Schaeffer was one of the most forward-thinkers of our day. In this work, he covers a huge amount of terriotory, and gives an accurate view of culture and thought. He doesn't attempt to go into exhaustive detail, which might frustrate some philosophy students, but his big-picture viewpoint makes him highly readable, understandable, and deadly accurate. Put on your ""must-read"" list."
5,Good wrenches,"When I bought my Harley I decided to stock up on some tools, LOL. I'm not saying you have to have lots of tools if you own a Harley but they do come in handy. Anyway, I had a bunch of cheap allen and torx wrenches that rounded fairly easily and never organized. My brother-in-law gave me a set of Bondhus allen wrenches and said they use them at the Coors plant in Colorado. After using them a few times I purchase several other sets of assorted allen and torx wrenches. These wrenches are of high quality. I love the Balldriver ends where you can actually come in at an angle as long as the bolt is not tight and finally, I love the rubber case. It helps you keep them organized and quickly pick up on the fact that yourmissing one."
4,Freaky....,Not a bad book...a bit sadistic at times. Nice bit of action in every chapter... won't bore you...very much a thriller. All in all nice book for anyone you don't have to be a fire marshal to appreciate it.
5,Much more than I expected.,"This book was great. Usually when I pick up crime related books from an author I am not familiar with, I cannot finish them. Not this one. This was a beautiful rookie season book from Mr. Kasminoff. It mixes terror, suspense, arousing sexual description, wanton violence, and insight. Insight into the career the author actually held. This book made me look at Fire Marshalls in a new way. Heroes. Thank you Mr. Kasminoff, you have showed me to my waiting career. Buy this, if not for the sake of interest, for a view of pure literary genius."
2,A decidedly mixed verdict,"Not much of a book -- if this is the official book, how come it feels so insubstantial? Slightly out of focus, like the photo on the book cover."
3,Way behind!!!,"I think that it is a great book, but it only covers the 2 first seasons. And I have been looking after a second edition, with updatet a season guide. But without any luck.I only give it 3 stars because, it if a good book, with good design, characters, and all the other things a good book needs. But then 3th and now the 4th season is in the air, is the book worthless.But I hope that there is coming a new edition. Because without that is the book just like a history book without the second world war, and all what's coming after that."
1,crystal key,To be fair I can't really rate this is was unable to play it in my computer. Sorry i bought it.
4,easy and expensive,"very easy to use; the numbers are meaningless however by themselves; you can only compare one area that you think may be dry with another; the company will absolutely refuse to even give you even a ball park of what wet or moist may be; they will only redefine the word ""relative"" for you; but very sturdy product and very expensive; I think I will keep it. It may help me or a family member in the future if we can establish a baseline. I purchased it too late this time around to be able to establish and compare a baseline for relativity sake."
5,A must have!,"Son House's internal struggle is evident in these tracks. Listen to 'John the Revelator' and 'Death Letter Blues'as examples. Some downplay Son's slide-playing skills----don't be misled, he played some raw, down and dirty slide that today's guitar slingers will never achieve."
4,The best available material from this master bluesman.,"From a technical viewpoint of his guitar playing, Son House was past him prime by the time of these recordings. Even so, there was no one else who belted out the blues when he had steel guitar in hand and an audience in front of him. Alan Wilsons' harp adds texture to several tracks, and never upstages, but complements House perfectly.I claim that anyone who really listens to 'Death Letter' and does not get chills up and down their spine, has their very soul on vacation.For historical interest, I recommend comparing this set with the Library of Congress recordings on the Biograph label. Both the differences in the approach to the music, and the similarities of two compositions, are striking and well worth noting.This is definetly the place to start your Son House collection - the old man by some accounts was as old as 79 at the time, yet this was the first time he was captured on modern recording equipment, in stereo, no less."
2,"The old master was goood,but.......","I own a large collection of delta blues cds,lps and 78s.This cd would only be of use to Son House absolute fanatics and completists. There is much in between song banter and confusion througout,although, it does have it's moments(i.e. John the Revelator will knock your socks off). For anyone interested at Son at his most devilish and in his prime,I would suggest the Document disk with Willie Brown,Garfield Akers and others. I would also suggest the 1941 Library of Congress field recordings available on Biograph."
4,Indeed - the best version of Huck Finn so far,"Of all the many movie versions of ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"", this PBS adaptation is the best. It remains true to Twain's story, though does not incorporate the entire book, for time constraint I suppose. However, enough of the book has been adapted to give the viewer a very good idea of what the book is all about. Patrick Day is by far the best of all the Huck Finn's I have seen, thus far. The actor who portrays Jim is outstanding; as is the acting from the Duke and the King. Also, the scenery is breathtaking. It is truly a joy to watch this movie version of Huck Finn, though apparantly it has been edited, and some of it has been taken out. If you can, buy the version that has the complete four hours - I gauruntee you will not be sorry. I strongly recommend this movie for everyone."
5,Not enough stars,"This is by far the best version of Huckleberry Finn. I've tried for the past 5 months to find this in DVD format in it's 214 minute glory, and finally have found it from Monterey Media. This version holds true to the book in it's unedited version and surpasses any other Huck Finn version in existance. I wish that the now defunct American Playhouse would have made Tom Sawyer to compliment this video. Maybe one day someone will."
4,Adventures of Huck Finn,"Content of this film is better than any other Huck Finn version. Aside from just a few scenes, the film is really true to the original text novel. The only thing that is a pain is that the dvd has no chapter or scene separations. Showing it to high school classes is difficult due to the constant rewinding and fast forwarding to find where we left off."
3,"Great film, bad DVD","This is one of the better adaptations of Huckleberry Finn I've seen. As a teacher, I have been using clips from the film with our study of the book. It doesn't match perfectly, but it is better than most.The main problem is the quality of the DVD. I have never seen a DVD with less features. There is no menu screen, no scene selection screen, and the chapters are divided in strange places - often in the middle of a scene or even in the middle of a speech! Four hours is an awful lot to fast forward through, and that's usually what I needed to do until I was familiar enough with the film to know where the scenes I needed were"
4,Huck Finn,"The DVD was a great addition to the book. I teach Special Education at the high school level.We read the book and I was looking for a DVD that was as close to the actual text as possible (some things were omitted for time). This DVD did not let me down. Be warned the language may offend some, but it is true to the book. The actors portrayal of the characters was done well. I would recommend this DVD."
5,Great for a classroom movie,I used this movie as a followup to reading the novel in my classroom. The students were excited to compare the movie and the book. The movie followed the novel very well. It was a nice ending to my novel unit.
5,True to the eternal spirit of Huck Finn,"An absolute delight from start to finish. About as true to the original story as movies ever get. It definitely captures the spirit of the tale and the portrayal of Huck is priceless, timeless, and peerless."
5,Great movie..quite entertaining!,I got this movie as I saw the program originally on PBS. Love it! It came so quickly too. Great service and am very pleased here.
2,Was very disappointed with this movie!,"When I purchased this dvd I had read a review saying that this version was the closest to the book version out there. I guess my mistake was that I hadn't actually read the book in it's entirety, which I intend to do now. When my husband and I finished the movie we decided not to keep it. It is not the wholesome movie we thought it might be. Of course we realize... how wholesome is a life like Huck Finn's to start with anyway? We aren't blind to that fact. We just know that if we had children of impressionable ages around wanting to watch movies and they said, ""Hey... The adventures of Huckleberry Finn... can we watch that one?""..... that we'd say... ""NO!!!"" Anyone considering getting this movie should really think about what values you personally are trying to instill within your family, and hold to them. This movie certainly does not do that for you."
1,What a stinker!,"I wanted to like this book. The reviews are all so glowing that I wonder if I were shipped the wrong book. The writing is amateurish, clumsy and cliché-ridden. The characters are so wooden and false that there is no suspension of disbelief. This book is just so bad...a complete waste of paper."
3,Mal Regreso !,"La Factoria es de esos grupo de exito, pero que al volver no suenan para nada, aunque este disco me gusto No Lastimes Mas No tiene mucha fuerza para tener exito, este disco no tiene los del anterior que lo hacia exquisito para la pista de baile, bueno creo que con esto desaparecera este grupo, esto siempre suele suceder."
5,A homerun of a bibliography for emerging readers!,"Covering the amazing achievements of one of the finest pitchers - woman or man - of all times, Jackie Mitchell, this picture-book biography is sure to fly off the shelves and engage even emerging readers, with it's intense, bright illustrations and cliff-hanging text. The story centers around Jackie's determination and hard work to become a great pitcher, fighting sexist discrimination and bad press. It's a tale of what someone can do with their dream, and would be an inspiration to all young people, ballplayers or not. The illustrations perfectly complement the text, and serve to make the story more intense and easy to relate to. This would be a great read-aloud for any classroom or library story time, and might be used to inspire older children to write stories of times they persevered with their dreams. Book has an author's note that lets kids know what happened to Jackie later on and a brief bibliography in the end papers."
5,Mighty Jackie The Strike-Out Queen Book Review,"Mighty Jackie is great book for young readers to be introduced to short biographies. This David and Goliath account of Jackie Mitchell is almost unheard of to avid sports enthusiasts. This is a great way to show young children that no matter what gender you are, hard work will pay off for those who try to reach their goals. Illustrator C.F. Payne had very good depictions of the baseball greats from the past that Mighty Jackie made history with in 1931."
3,Jackie,"Since this is a true story, I expected at least some photos instead of the grossly distorted caricatures presented."
4,Tough scientists,"A team of scientists are given a series of challenges that they must meet using a limited array of materials and their own ingenuity. The episodes are short, so they zip along rather quickly, too much so in some cases, and I suspect there was a bit of behind-the-camera fudging as well, but the result is an entertaining show that makes science exciting."
4,boston acoustic surround,"incredible diffuse sound,very happy with the ambience these speakers bring to my dolby digital system."
2,Not good for a younger child who is already into golf,"I was not wowed by the look of this book. We bought it for my 7 year old nephew who is really into golf and he thought it was too basic, and the cover does not inspire a child to read it. It looks like something that would come off my grandmother's bookshelf in terms of the bland hardcover. I needs a new, kid-friendly cover at the very least - I was a little embarrased to give it to him as a gift."
5,Great book!,Wonderful book for kids who are learning about golf. It keeps them interested and yet teaches them valuable lessons at the same time.
5,Lives up to it's commercial rating,"Heavy duty hose with excellent fittings. Moves a bunch more water than the 5/8""I would highly recommend this hose. Priced well through Amazon."
5,Practical and helpful,"This book is great for parents and coaches, after commenting some details with other parents and my son's Basquetball coach, everyone asked for the name of the book. It is practical and simple, and you will find specific nutrition recommendations for different sports."
4,A Tribute to Gypsy Guitarist Django Reinhardt,"Harri Stojka is a gypsy guitarist. Now you probably have to be pretty to date on jazz to even know what that means or indicates OR you can listen to this infectious CD and discover for yourself.Harri Stojka, born in Vienna as a Roma gypsy, carries on the tradition of the spectacular fingering and improvisations for which Django was internationally known in the 1930s. For the new listener this is music that is reminiscent of Kurt Weill, of strolling players across the continent of Europe and Asia, and of some down home American sounds. Stojka is an incredible technician with faster, cleaner fingers on the struts than most anyone else around. He is accompanied on this selection of thirteen tunes by Heimo Wiederhofer on brush snare, Claudius Jelinek on rhythm guitar and banjo, and Eva Berky on violin. The results are as fresh as anything around the jazz world today. Listening to this recording it is impossible not to yearn to dance! Grady Harp, October 06"
4,A great book but...,"First of all the physical description of the book. It's slightly too large for a pocket type guide. The pages are glossy with excellent photos.Considering the collection that this work covers however it is way too thin. The selected approximately 200 ""important"" pieces. I'm not sure how they determined the importance of these pieces as there was no discernable pattern. It was broken up into the age the pieces were from (with a fair smattering from each period) but that appears to be the only categorization. For each piece there is a brief description ranging from a line next to the picture to a page long.Sadly this gives no indication of Mr. Getty's personal tastes and which items he preferred. Otherwise a great book."
1,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!,"This is the cheapest piece of junk I have ever seen. Forget the fact that the costume is only the half shirt and a vest with cheap paper belts; it is misleading for anyone who buys the costume. My autistic son saw a picture of this and had his grandmother buy it on Amazon. He loves pirate things. The picture clearly shows the hat and sword with it . Of course when it came, none of the things were with the costume. What a ripoff. Never again."
3,J.P. Hits a Down Hill Drag,"A MORE PERFECT UNION is an intriguing title for J.P. Beaumont's meandering case. It isn't his case and he's cutting in on another's turf, which earns him departmental censor. Beau is out for justice for the victim and there is little mystery to solve. The work comes in proving the conclusion.This is a story more about relationships, than about police procedure. But it doesn't hold the power of the title, though it will keep you reading.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelThe Bluegrass Dream: A Wilderness Adventure of Early Settlers"
2,JUST OK,"If JA Jance is Seattle's Dashiell Hammett, I am moving to San Francisco. This is pretty OK. But keep in mind I read Louis LaMour sometimes too. I am just not proud of it."
3,Postage Meter ink cartridges,"Although the product states the ink is ""red"", it really is PINK. The ink is very legible. I am waiting to see how long the ink lasts in comparison to Pitney Bowes before increasing my rating on this product."
3,is aight.,"Nothing wrong with the beats, just not mainstream reggaeton. I like the fact that it's got a real chill vibe to it. For the mainstream there is the track ""Play that song""ft nina sky, I can dance to that so I dig it. ""Tranquila"" soothes me. Aside from that the rest is for old school reggaeton fans. I personally found it to be ""Aight"" Sample before you buy."
2,very poor reggaeton,"This is the worst reggaeton album I heard in years. The beats sounds old, is like beats of the beginning of the reggaeton music, Tony is good hip hop producer but reggaeton, simply he doesnt know how to do it."
4,No such thing but...,"I need a fairly long hose to reach the recesses of my yard and have tossed any number of garden hoses because of the ""kink factor"". While this hose is not totally kink free it is the closest I have ever seen as it has only kinked on one or two occasions. I like its relative light weight and virtual kink free design and recommend it to anyone looking for a kink free hose."
1,Terrible Quality,"Well, the anti-kink metal spiral came of after a week of lightly use and the hose cracked open 2 weeks later. Now, I have 100' of junk."
2,Almost a great hose.,"This hose was great at first; however it does not handle high pressure well. Our secondary water system puts out 125 to 145 PSI, which caused the hose to expand and loose ""NeverKink"" rating. The high pressure made it very pliable and now it kinks a lot. Also hose connection leaks where the threaded coupler attaches to the hose (there is a weakness in the joint). I think I will buy a different brand next time."
2,Fragile; prone to burst in the summer,"""400 psi"" ... not. I've had two burst on me. I'm going to repair it, but my next hoses will be Goodyear's industrial / heavy-duty line of hose. My review applies to all of Apex Neverkink ""Commercial Duty"" hoses."
2,Problem with roller,The hose that connects to the faucet rolls up and kinks when I unroll the hose. Is there any idea how I might be able to stop it from turning. I have several hose rollers but have never had this problem.
1,Always kink hose,"I have purchased 2 """"NeverKink"" brand hoses in the past, and both were constantly getting kinked. I finally threw the first one in the trash after several years. The second one I still use, but it kinks every time I pull it. I'm on Amazon today looking for a different brand of hose, and couldn't believe that this bad hose had some 5 star ratings? I have not had one explode, but buy this hose at your own risk. It will kink, guaranteed!"
5,Best story of Africa since The Snows of Kilimanjaro!,"You can feel, taste, and smell Africa in this wonderful story. Masterfully written. Leaves you wanting more."
5,so much better than the US version,"If you're looking to purchase The Annual 2006 by The Ministry of Sound, this is the version to get! Unlike the US version which only contains 20 tracks total [2 cds @ 10 tracks/cd], most of which are long, awful remixes [the remix of 'Dark Side of the Moon' on that CD made me cringe], this set contains 40 music tracks [2 cds @ 20 tracks/CD] and 20 music videos on a bonus DVD. Compared to the US version, the Limited Edition Box Set also has, in my opinion, a better selection of tracks--my favourite so far being 'Watchin'' by The Freemasons. Plus, if nothing else, the DVD contains the music video, 'Star to Fall' by Cabin Crew--that makes the album worth purchasing in itself--why can't flying be more like that lol..."
3,A very poor showing from MOS,I normally love any compilation MOS puts out but this collection is just lacking. I would recommend getting the regular version instead of this import.
2,it will upgade you,"it will upgade you to vista alright, but you will have to pay money after the fact and that fact was not mentioned. I bought an xp upgrade and it was one shot one cost and i'll stick to that, i'm not a fan of vista"
3,Does the job but...,"There are better made leashes out there, such as the Kelty leash which I ended up buying two after purchasing this one. The Kelty leash is just a better overall product for about the same price. Will probably never use this one."
4,Trade,"watching this film really shows how personal cultural differences can be. what this guy said about it being a kevin kline comedy is completely irrelevant. if you wanna know what the film is about read the description and check this movie out. i highly recommend it, i bought this movie myself. i think this movie deserves more than a 2. i liked it alot. so i give it 4 stars. check it out!"
3,We were not terribly impressed...,"It is probably not one we'll watch again, if so not as often as many others we own. It was fair, but that is all, fair."
1,Soap Opera,"This film is a soap opera at best: Contrived Brady Bunch dialog; ridiculous storylines and bad acting. I tried to sit through the entire film to give it a chance, but found it too painful (due to the presentation, not the subject). DVD went straight into the garbage. The fact that this film currently ranks 4-stars in Amazon, and won a Boston film festival award, reflects poorly on both forums."
4,Makes you angry,"I give this movie 4 stars because it got its message across with me. It pissed me off. The subject matter is as others have described, the kidnapping of girls and boys for the sex slave trade. I can't believe these people are able to live within their communities with everybody knowing what they do. I don't want to cross any lines here but I was very pleased with the ending of this movie which provided some justice for the viewers.The acting was very good. Cesar Ramos did a great job playing the vengeful brother, and Kevin Kline is a master actor. I take my hat off to the cast. The pace was just right and kept my interest.Like others have said, the subject matter is gruesome and there is a rape scene. Do not take the kids to see this movie."
3,Missing the Punch,"Having seen 'Trade' and measured it against the likes of Human Trafficking and Taken, Trade sadly falls short of the mark. It's very stark, the story moves along almost too fast in certain parts and painfully slow in others. Don't even get me started on the lone suicide in the movie and the decidedly lack of real closure at the end of it. Good storytelling this movie can't bring you, I'd take Taken any day of the week."
4,Sex-Trade Drama,"This film was not critically praised (27 on Rotten Tomatoes), but despitea melodramatic second half, the film was informative, disturbing, andfor me, riveting. Like ""Pay It Forward"", Kevin Kline again stars in a movie with a serious social message. A 13 year old girl is kidnapped bya ring of sex-traffickers, who sneak her and a few others, out of Mexicointo America and other countries, to be sold to pedophiles, often forvery large sums of money over the internet. Since the movie is meant tobe educational as well as entertaining, some realism is sacrificed. Butit is intense and riveting, and the performances are good. While it wasmade by the maker of ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" which was considered a farbetter film, having seen both, I would rather watch this over againdespite its rather obvious flaws."
4,deep movie,I liked the movie it was pretty enjoyable but slow at some times hard to follow had to keep going back
3,A minor insight into the problem of sex trafficking.,"A little of an anti-climactic ending. What got me going was the involvement of the American agent in the boy's pursuit of his sister. Two wierd events I found with the movie: (1) Why did the one who was a woman call her -mother- when they both should have went to the cops right away? (2) How could this woman kill herself and leave the little girl alone? A third was the manila envelope. Why'd the American give it to the boy, how'd he get the cash back in it so fast, and why was he seen with it driving after this on the highway with it?!jasonp"
2,DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR ME,This book just dragged on and on and on. I could hardly wait to get to the end.
4,A very enjoyable read with an unusual hero,"I agree with everything reviewer 'tregatt' has said, but Ibelieve this book deserves a strong 4 stars."
1,YUCK,I've tried several of this brand and can only stand one (the Neroli). They all start with a sharp note. On this one it never fades away. Instead you end up smelling like an old lady who applied some freesia perfume and then doused herself in Aqua Net hairspray. YUCK!
2,Whispers in the Dark,"This is the first book that I read in the Marti MacAlister mystery series. The story was told at a slow pace. Out of five murders, only three were solved. Sharon was the character that held my attention the most. Emotionally, she was not capable of balancing her relationships between her daughter, mother and husband."
3,The African American Press,I bought it for two reasons. My uncle was one of the Editor's of the Pittsburgh Courier in the thirties and fouties and I thought it might be helpful with my genealogy. D. Sands
2,Simplistic view of our past,"The Ape-Man Within offers a simplistic view of our pre-historic past. Nothing is explained just presupposed. Readers should do better to take a look at writers like Alexander, R.D. Leakey, R. or Stephen Gould to understand something of our human nature and the way we evolved. Michael Olson."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I have nothing positive to say about this cart. I have plenty of bad things to say:1) The hubs on the wheels are not square to the axles, and the wheels wobble terribly. They're so bad that you can't push it with any speed or it shakes everything off of the cart.2) The rubber mat is glued down on the top. This in itself is OK, but the glue is spread larger than the mat when they're applying it and it makes the top of the cart sticky.3) The tires are pneumatic, not foam-filled, and leak.4) The wheels do not bolt squarely onto the bottom of the cart, and the thing looks bow-legged even brand new.The concept of this cart is a good one. The execution is terrible."
3,What happened to this thing?,"I ordered this platform truck that cam from Jet and when it arrived the box wasn't in good shape and the bed was dented like it was probably a return from a previous cutomer who abused it; however, all the parts were accounted for.My other complaint is the swivel casters are slightly uneven and one of them becomes flat after a few days. I will just see if I can get replacement swivel casters for it, if possible.Another thing is the fold-down of the haldle is not as smooth as it should be primarily because it is metal and it should have been a type of tough rubber or maybe kevlar instead.On a positive note this item is very easy to handle once you get the hang of it and it stores eaily in my small apartment."
2,Not packaged to be shipped.,"The other reviews are absolutely right. The wheels weight about 5 lbs each and are wrapped in the flimsiest bubble wrap ever (the bubbles pop as you hold the casters in your hands). They are shipped *loose* inside a flimsy cardboard box along with the platform. As you can imagine, this means a very non-square package inside a square box - no packing foam.It's not a question of whether this cart will arrive damaged, it's just a matter of how bad. Mine had about 10 dimples, a bent cross brace on the handle, and a substantial dent in the corner.Other carts I've purchased have shipped assembled with no outer packaging. That would have been a safer approach for this cart.Additionally, the glue covers more area than the mat, and never dries, so it gets on everything. Maybe some Goo Gone or something will take it off.This item should be pulled from Amazon until the manufacturer can re-package it for safe shipment."
1,regular advice but horrible quality production,"The advice in this DVD is the same advice you'd get in many DVDs on Muay Thai, however, the quality of the production is extremely low. The sound is awful. Look elsewhere unless you don't mind spending $30 for low-quality production values and generic advice."
1,End of Handle was too thick,It is nice looking spatula. But end of handle was too thick to use. This is for people has big hand.
1,Botched product listing,"This product is incorrectly listed. The Porter-Cable 12330 hook-shank blade has 14 teeth per inch (tpi) and not 6 as stated in the listing. Even the photo is wrong - it shows a #12320. Get with it, Amazon! IF, if, if one can actually buy the 12330 blade, it is great for cutting non-ferrous metals - smooth cuts and long-lasting."
2,Not so great,I LOVE THIS POPE...but this book was just tiny snippets of things he said...not giving you a real big picture...I wanted more....I was disappointed in this...
4,A Good Read!,"This is a solidly written, clear and comprehensive guide to leading teams. Author Gregory E. Huszczo touches on almost every subject a team leader needs to know - what skills are necessary, how you develop them, how you build teams, what you do when conflict erupts and so on. This book is an excellent introduction to team building for someone newly assigned to a team. It also offers important advice for executives of companies that are considering a team approach to management. The style is clear and straightforward, but quite academic. The author cites research and evidence to back his assertions, but he does not provide much in the way of entertainment. We find that those who like to swallow their management lore straight from the bottle will savor this book; those who prefer to mix it with anecdotes may wish to imbibe elsewhere."
1,rip off,BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING THIS PRODUCT. IT LOOKS LIKE THE OTHER COMPETITION BUT THE PILLS ARE 1/2 THE SIZE. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
1,your common sense measure UV index better than this one,"the product we got is defective. the liquid display can only show partial of the digits. If you try to measure uv index behind window glass, it always shows 0, no matter how strong the sun is, which doesnt make sense to me.As for the UV index measurement, it always show me 2 levels below what the weather forecast says and it doesnt tell you more than what your common sense can tell you.Additional comments on 2012:For those who need uv protection, especially those who have medical conditions, please dont be fooled by the comments made on this review. Regular glass will NOT block uv light, neither does cloudy sky. What does your doctor tell you? Dont drive between 10am-3pm if you need protection. Why do many cars have ""uv blocking window glass"" (toyota highlander etc) if regular glasses can block uv?Believe them at your own risk (actually one comment said he got rashes after long driving, so did some of my friend)"
4,Disappearing item.,I use these to make a unique Christmas decoration. The fit the bill perfectly but are getting harder to find.
5,"Gets straight to the point, teaches essentials fast",I have used this book for several years. It gets straight to the point and teaches the children what they need to know to start reading. I have seen this program used with hearing impaired children and children in a regular classroom---successfully.
3,Reasonably good program; worth considering,"This book, aside from its self-aggrandizing title, is pretty much what itMs. Pecci obviously thinks highly of her approach, and has fairly scathing things to say about other approaches. The basis to her complaints are valid -- phonics *is* often taught with too much emphasis on memorizing arbitrary rules with complex exceptions, and other approaches fail to address developing knowledge of sound/symbol relationships. However, her comparison of the other methods is painfully dated -- she still refers to the sight word approaches that really haven't been part of the reading debate for many years. I didn't mind; I really didn't need to read any more about the whole language debate.I can believe that Ms. Pecci used this sequence of instruction successfully with her students, but I would consider other methods which have been developed with more rigorous attention to practices which have worked for many people, rather than just one tutor"
2,"Could help, but there are better materials out there","It's a nice thing that publishing is easy enough now so people can share their tools for teaching. And I know a lot of people have had to step in and teach their kids themselves when the schools didn't do it. This book's okay, but a reading method for every child? Haven't we heard that one before? The content is easy to use, easy to read, so if somebody had a kid in need and they didn't have enough background to use other educational materials (which would be more flexible and adaptable to an individual kid's needs, but would require teaching experience), it would probably help. I would only hope that the person doing the teaching wouldn't blindly accept the title, and would still use their own common sense, too."
1,Hated it,"This book was terrible compared to Heartland. Dylan, the main character in the story, should have been suspended for stupidly taking a dare that two other rich girls gave her. The dare was to jump a course in the dark. Dylan could have injured her mount, badly. But she didn`t care. All she cared about was being the best jumper on the team. Dylan also expected special treatment from her aunt, who is a riding instructor at Chestnut Hill. But her aunt is too moody to pay attention to Dylan. To sum it up, this book is not really about horses. It is about fitting in. Heartland, however, is about listening to the horses. No one at Chestnut Hill really and truly listens to the horses."
4,Kind of dissapointed.,I think that Lauren Brooke should have kept on writing about Amy and her going to college. I wanted to know what went on with Lou's baby! What about Ty? And Grandpa and Nancy? Will we ever hear about Amy or her freinds and family again?
2,Sad,"Lauren Brooke PLEASE keep writing Heartland! I write books myself and Heartland has inspiried me! i am thirteen. Just please keep writing Heartland, i was so disappointed when I saw that you were going to write a new series- no book is even close to being as good as Heartland. I know so many friends that you want you to keep writing Heartland! SO please hear me out and continue Heartland!"
1,Chesnut Hill,I can't even get myself 2 keep reading this book! Its kinda boring...Heartland is so much better!!!!! I hope Lauren Brooke will still write Heartland and stop Chesnut Hill...I know A TON of people who think the same thing!!!!!!
3,havent read it yet,i havent read this book yet but i kno it'll b fantastic cuz lauren brooke's really talented & rites awsum books but im really dissapointed that heartland had 2 end. like is AMY in these series??????????????????????????? i kno my review doesnt help but the others dont either can SUMBODY tell me wut this books about?????
5,The best new series has finally came!,"chestnut hill is the best new series! this is what book 1 is basically about: dylan has wanted to go to chestnut hill for years and her parents are finally leting her. when she gets there she meets her room mates honey(felicity) and lynsey. dylan wants to be on the riding team bad and so does lynsey. dylan and lynsey do not start out on a very good friendship. dylan also meet malory who got picked to go to chestnut hill for free. dylan and malory are fighting and do not become friends in the beginning. dylan favorite pony morello is also staying a chestnut hill nothing could be better but when lynsey gives dylan a dare, dylan doesn't want to refuse..... could this really take her chances of being on the riding team away or will there be some way she will still be ready?"
1,Not Recommended,"This books states that the abandoned babies in China do not have parents who love them. These babies are abandoned because of the government's rules and ramifications of having more than one child, not that are unloved. I do not want my daughter to think she was not loved by her birth parents, but abandoned due to circumstances beyond their control. I feel the statement in this book that these girls were unloved could have serious ramifications on them, hence I got rid of my copy of this book before my daughter got old enough to understand it. This book features the author's trip to China with limited pictures and information. There are much better books out there about adopting from China."
1,Not 'adoptee' friendly,"I was anxiously awaiting this book only to open and find that the first page indicated the Chinese peoples'/birthparents inability to love these children...When in fact it is culture and history thousands of years old which force Chinese parents to make a plan of adoption. A loving decision considering their difficult circumstances.I want to share a loving story with my daughter, not one which implies that love only comes from the adoptive family."
4,My daughter loves this book!,"Although I would agree with other readers about one sentence in the book, otherwise it is a factual account of what my husband and I did in China when we adopted her. It is true that many children in China do not have mothers and fathers to love them, but I could tell my daughter that that is also true here in the US. Olivia is 3 and this book is a great way to talk about how she came into our family on her level. She asks to read the story of Ariela ""Shanway"" every night!!! It makes her feel good that this little girl shares her story.It is only one tool that we use in our family to talk about her life before in China and after we came to China to bring her into our family!Julie GaglioneMom to Livvy from Yangchun, PRC"
2,Hard to get it all right...,"This book is definitely too old for my 3.5 year old son to introduce him to the story that will be his little sister's. He cant bridge the gap that this story is relevant and about someone else. So my task remains hard to find books that can introduce preschoolers to the concept of their new sibling adoption. Anyway, the terms and concepts seem dated, but the book does give me ideas for my new daughter's life book. So in that respect I found it very useful."
1,Only interesting to authors family.,"This book will be of interest only to friends and family of the author, but unfortunately boring to everyone else. It consists of 22 pages with one or more family pictures on each page and a few lines of text. Very much like a family album. If you know the author you may enjoy it. If you don't know the author, go look at your neighbors family album for free. It will be equally interesting."
5,Piano jazz the way it's meant to be,Disney's music writers are a talented group. Brubeck shows great respect for the original pieces as he takes these lyrical and well-identified pieces and turns them into exceptional jazz.
3,"Pleasant, but mostly boring","As a long-time Brubeck fan, I bought this album mainly to hear the quartet's rendition of ""Alice in Wonderland"". It wasn't bad, but I was unimpressed. I was also unimpressed with most of the rest of the album. There were certainly some nice bits, and a great performance of ""Someday my Prince will Come"", but on the whole this album just wasn't my cup of tea."
4,Dave Digs Disney ~ Dave Brubeck,"Great CD of golden oldiesGetting the sticky security seal off the CD to get it open was a really hard chore. Needed a special sticky spot remover product or kero and a lot of patience, so you don't damage the CD holder."
3,JUST OKAY,I PURCHASED THIS WITH THE IDEA IT WOULD BE A TYPICAL BRUBECK CD AND WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY DISSAPOINTED IT CONTAINED ALL DISNEY TUNES BUT A FEW WERE NOT EASILY RECOGNIZABLE OVERALL IT WAS WELL DONE.
3,Dave Digs Disney,"We love Dave Brubeck: The old 78's, 45's, and the LP's. If you can't get an LP copy of this, then the CD copy works just great for dinner parties, etc."
4,"Classic, good stuff!","Great for any fan of Brubeck, Disney, or jazz! I've listened to it quite a few times in the last couple weeks. ""When you wish..."", ""Someday my Prince will Come"" and ""So this is Love"" are particularly sweet!"
3,A Decent Overview - But Lacking in Depth,"This volume contains a fair overview of the types of weapons employed in Vietnam, but does not provide any particular detail on any of them. It will be a fair addition to a general collection, but is not really written for a serious student of either weaponry or Vietnam."
5,A Chance To Learn From the Greatest,"When people think of George Patton, they tend to think of the larger than life character portrayed in the movie. While colorful, Patton was above all a superb manager who knew how to motivate people to accomplish the seemingly impossible. This book takes what made Patton a successful manager and analyzes it in detail so that the average person can apply to his or her own field of endeavor. I suggest you read the book and then, after each section, close it and think about how what you've just read can be applied to your own situation. Patton's intense focus on what he wanted to accomplish, and his no nonsense way of communicating his vision, are valuable lessons for managers in any field. Few can emulate Patton, but we can all learn from him."
3,Inspirational and reinforces...,"This book basically translates Patton's notecards to himself into paragraph form then summarizes them, is fairly informative. Some of the Axelrod's summaries made me think and inspired me, some left me thinking ""Doesn't everybody know that?"" however it did reinforce some lessons my dad had taught me. I did notice some contradictions between several passages with either Patton's own words or Axelrod's briefs. I would suggest purchasing this book, since it reinforces some habits that you have learned along the way or will make you think ""outside the box."""
4,Patton on Leadership : Strategic Lessons for Corporate Warfa,"This book should be studied by anyone that supervises others. It's content is not limited to military personnel, but would be appropriate for anyone in a leadership role."
2,"Good principals, laid out poorly","I was expecting something different from this book is where my average review comes from. I got this book because I read George Steinbrenner gave it to Derek Jeter.I was expecting more of a traditional Autobiography with interwoven lessons Patton learned from his life experiences. The book is really just those lessons with brief examples. Each idea is about a page long, and broken down idea by idea. This made it hard to read for long periods and the rhythm was really weird.The lesson and leadership ideas were great. Right up the Jack Welch, Good To Great alley, obviously with an old school military twist Patton was a hard ass but there is a lot of humility and honesty in his leadership style. Overall I liked Patton and his ideas, but this book was not laid out as well as I had hoped."
2,Patton on Toast,"Leadership depends upon dynamism (action). ""Go forward."" (p. 53) It means application using past battles as lessons. The author was clear that Patton believed in direct action based on facts. The center of the book stresses Patton's action orientation ad nauseum. The three maxums are speed, simplicity and boldness. In presentation, Patton has the sound of genius and the subtext tells a story of impulsive foolishness, high drama and overcompensation. It is unclear if the author intended to impliy that or if it is misreading in the Paul de Man sense. Pattion was a show and, perhaps, a rebel though that is not clear in the book either. He said ""Army regulations are written by those who have never been in battle."" (p 248) The author suggests it has something to say about corporate management. What, the author doesn't say. Using polite military terms, the book is S.O.S.(on toast) Go figure. Eric J. Lindblom PhD Harvard"
4,Quick and Dirty,"Axelrod boils down Patton's leadership principles to a quick hitter that proves valuable to any leader. The book is filled with examples of Patton being hard on his men, knowing that it will ultimately save their lives in combat down the road. Easy to read and nicely chopped up; so the reader can pick it up and put it down when the opportunity presents itself.Like Nick Lowe sang, ""You gotta be cruel to be kind..."""
5,An amazing drama of an influential man,"I saw this in high school, and was thrilled when it came out on DVD. Long unavailable it has been released for a new generation to view.It is as strong as I remember it being, and the trials of the father of the atomic bomb were disturbing.The politics of the bomb and its controversial use are explained. It is a drama, and shows how the government used and discarded Oppenheimer and the witch hunt of the McCarthy era. In one scene they say, ""If you were a British citizen, they would have given you a knighthood."" Well, the U.K. may well have destroyed Oppenheimer also. They certainly did a number on the man most responsible for defeating the Enigma machine, Alan Turing.But it does show the rise and fall of Oppenheimer, and his redemption of his scientific career."
4,Ahead of its time,"I have just watched this series on DVD: although over thirty years have passed since I saw it on TV and I have read a lot of physics and history since then, I am still impressed. Not only a beautifully controlled story allowed to develop at a pace that lets us explore the characters in depth, fine acting and excellent location filming, but also an appreciation of both Oppenheimer and his milieu that is true to later research, up to and including Bird and Sherwin's ""American Prometheus""."
4,Oppenheimer - national hero and scapegoat,"Circumstances led security forces to suspect Oppenheimer as the source of the breach. They were looking in the wrong place. The video series gives a good representation of this compelling story of the creation of the first atomic bombs. Consider for further study the following:book and film: 'Enola Gay;' book: 'Making of the Bomb,' Roades; movie: 'Day One,' which follows Roades' story. A recent book: 'War's End' by Gen Chuck Sweeney gives the story from the point of view of the pilot who delivered the second bomb."
4,"pretty good,not pogo","i like this when i wasnt on line playing pogo,there is no comparison to the two ,on line wins hands down. that being said im glad i got this when i wasnt on line. the games are fun . and the game want that expensive ."
2,No trae el papel protector,"Caro y además el libro vino un poco manchado y manoseado, sin la portada y contraportada con la imagen en la foto. Directamente el libro negro."
4,Great Mocumentary!,Loved this film. It was hard to believe the actor was not really in the poo business! The special features added to the charm of the film and appreciated the family connections. For those who like subtle humor and great Aussie colloquialisms this film is a must!
3,Walking in Another Man's Filthy Boots,"An Australian indie film, 'Kenny' has us following in the boots of an easy-going port-o-rental worker whose day-to-day struggle is more than about filth as it about people's attitudes. Filled with empathy and good humor, the title character (a lisping Shane Jacobson) frames the prima donnas he meets who easily show how much people take for his indispensable (sorry!) work for granted. There's a lot of poop to contend in his life (in more ways than one), but the film takes an even keel when Kenny goes to a bathroom rental convention in Nashville, Tennessee where he meets a warm and engaging stewardess. Yes, there's potty humor for sure, but so much more!A J.P.'s Pick 3*'s =Good"
5,Shallow Grave in Trinity County,"This book is a well written documentary of a fourteen year old girl who was abducted and murdered on her way home from school in Oakland , California in the mid 1950's. It tells of the police investigation and eventual apprehension and trial of the man believed to have been her killer.The time, place and people in this true story all relate to my experience at that time period when I was living in Berkeley. Strange to say but even after reading the book, I don't remember reading or knowing about the event. I found the story facinating, especially the careflly related investigation and the trial. I was amazed at how the evidence was analized with the tools of the time to make a case against the suspect.My recommendation is to read the book. It will make you think and wonder about the participants and their motives for a long time.Jan M.Now living in Trinity County"
3,MY LAST HOME TOWN,I WASN'T AS HAPPY WITH THIS BOOK AS I THOUGHT I WOULD BE. I LIVED IN THIS AREA FOR 20 YRS AND KNEW OF THE STORY. I DIDN'T THINK THIS BOOK DID IT JUSTICE...STRANGE AS THE OTHER AREA THAT THE MURDER CAME FROM WAS JUST OVER THE BAY BRIDGE FROM WHERE I GREW UP.
1,Piece of JUNK!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this phone about a year to two years ago and the lcd panels went completely out. I could not see who was calling and the light also went out on the phone. The only reason I bought the phone was the price and the rebate. That was a wasit of time and money. I went to radio shack and bought some nice phones and they were less than I paid for the olympia phones plus they have a speakerphone and some other features that olympia did not offer. If you want an expanable phone set, DO NOT GET AN OLMPIA. IT IS A WORTHLESS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,All LCD panels went out,"The phone system works great and as described. However, the system is less than two years old and all three handset LCD panels have gone out."
1,Poor Quality after 4 months,"When I first purchased this phone and the two additional 2420 extensions I thought it was great! No phone outlet for extensions, no problem. Then four months later, the sound quality started to fail, then the LCD display quit working on not ONE, not TWO, but ALL THREE phones!When I called CS they informed me I would have to mail all three back to them (at my cost) and they would e-mail me further instructions within 24 hours . . . well, that was weeks ago!"
1,these phones are worthless,"I bought three of these things and on all three phones the LCD display quit One after a year and 1/2, the other two quit in two weeks and the company won't replace the two hand sets that are still in the warranty period. Buy something else!"
1,Poor Quality,"I bought the 2410 and 3 additional handsets. The feature set is great, but- callers reported persistent echo unless I turned down the earpiece volume rather low.- callers reported an annoying, loud, beep every so often. This couldn't be tracked down - it's not call waiting and it's not the messages waiting notification. Neither of these conditions occured on another 2.4GHz phone I have. A friend of ours who saw that we had this phone said he had had the same problem and eventually returned the phone.- shortly after the warranty ran, 2 of the four handset's displays gradually got scrambled and now are completely unreadable.- The company's toll-free number wasn't working and they never responded to e-mail support requests.There are good deals out there. This phone is a waste of money."
1,Disappointed,"I bought one of these phones with the base station, which includes the digital answering machine and one additional handset. I originally liked it, but after several months to a year the sound quality on the answering machine went way down. Sometimes it is difficult to understand messages received. The digital answering machine does not work properly and you cannot skip messages anymore. As well the display panels on both units have burned out, so the caller ID function has been rendered entirely useless. Given the option I would definitely choose a different system and plan to replace this one."
1,This one eats tapes!,"After reading the mixed reviews on this VCR (some say it's wonderful; others claim it eats tapes), I decided to purchase it since it was potentially a great value. Big mistake. This VCR ate the first 2 tapes it was fed. I will be returning it, and trying something with a better track record."
1,Returning after 1 day of use,"Very disappointed. Problematic from the beginning. Terrible manual. Stopped halfway through a timed recording session. And worst of all - absolutely would not eject a tape. It took 20 minutes of effort to get the tape out - through a combination of pressing eject, shaking machine and trying to grab at tape before it was sucked back into chamber. Caveat emptor!"
5,"A ""Best Buy"" in my opinion","After searching for 3 weeks for a new VCR, I chose this one for two reasons. The excellent brand name and the price. It is surprisingly lightweight and easy to handle/set up. The instruction book is very well written. I would highly recommend this product if you are in the market for a new VCR."
1,"WELL, IT'S NOT AS BADLY WRITTEN AS MOST OF AVAKIAN'S BOOKS...","This is an interesting autobiography of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA's self ""exiled"" chairman, Bob Avakian. The personal stuff is actually very interesting - I enjoyed reading about his personal life before his rise to far left celebrityhood.The political stuff is interesting too - unlike most of Avakian's official political writing, he actually explains HOW the RCP came to hold various political views.Still, this is very much an ""official history"" so a lot is left out.Also, it appears that the RCP actually edited the words of their great Chairman - which is the only reason this book is readable (the rest of Avakian's body of work is long winded and boring).I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this book - but if you must read one book by Bob Avakian, let it be this one."
4,"Very spacious, but","I like the bag a lot. Would buy again; and I bought mainly because of the size and color. But now that I have used it for 2 weeks, I would re-think the color. Not because I don't like it, but because it picks up dirt from simple touches to other things very easily. Feel like I am constanly cleaning or having to be very careful what it touches."
3,Not a bad Tim Drake starter,"It wasn't what I thought it was going to be about, but it tells a story about Tim Drake's training. If you want a real Tim Drake origin story go and get ""A Lonely Way of Dying"""
3,A decent introduction!,"Haaaave you met Tim? Tim Drake takes over the mantle of Robin in this story from the early nineties. I never read it originally and I think its done pretty well. The Batman portion of the book is a little more grounded and captivating than the intro into Robin's solo book. The villains and perils in that are kind of laughable. The art holds up pretty well and is totally reminiscent of the era. Overall, a decent introduction that lacked a little back story but holds up over time pretty well."
4,overlooked gem,"In a time where comics sink to new lows in terms of story & artwork is the ""only"" thing that matters.... this book is an exception.A solid story & worthy art in a cute (cheap) little package.Worth picking up."
4,Product Arrived Just As It Was Described,"There have been quite a few reviews stating that the product has been incomplete (arrived without the outside spongy looking filter). Well this product arrived to me just as described in the product description and picture. I haven't used it yet, so can't say if it works good or not but initial impressions are a-ok!Will update after use."
1,Only the inner filter,"As others have previously stated, its only the inner filter, not the outer filter, despite the description and picture both showing both filters. Avoid this deceiving listing."
4,Fair price for fair quality,"I needed a replacement filter for our Bissell vac. I really only needed the air filter. When reading the reviews, there were quite a few people who complained about the fact that the item is advertised as a 2-piece set, while they only received a single filter. I received the set, brand new. The vac is all happy after putting them in. And for such a price, one shouldn't struggle ..."
5,work great,my vacuume work much better then the old one is faster love and faster shippied too thanks againwill telll my family abt it
1,Do NOT Order! Only the inner filter will be shipped!,I should have read the other reviews. Only the inner filter is shipped. Outter foam filter does not arrive. I complained to Amazon after reading other people with the same reviews. False advertising for what is pictured above. Amazon did however give me a full refund.
3,Pretty satisfied - looks different when received product,"I am pretty sure that I ordered the correct part for my Bissell - the picture looks exactly like it and the numbers matched up. However, when I received the part, the foam piece was MUCH thinner width wise than what I currently had on my vaccuum from the manufacturer. It was also a struggle get the piece locked in place. It does work so I can't complain too much - I guess i was shocked more about the foam piece being so cheap looking and not anywhere similar to what I was replacing. The one I had on my vaccuum was twice as thick as this one and wasnt as tight when wrapped around the wheel. As I write this, maybe I should have returned it..."
1,No foam filter!,"Do not order from this vendor. The description states that it is a 2-pack that has both the pleated filter and the foam filter, but it arrived as just the pleated filter. The vendor had a Bissell #32064 sticker on the bag the single filter arrived in, which is not the correct product number if you are ordering only the pleated filter. On their website, Bissell product #32064 is for the set of both foam and pleated filters. Amazon did however do a great job accepting the return and sending a replacement from a different vendor."
1,It is not a two pack,"It says its a two pack and also shows the picture as a two pack including the foam filter, but it is not. It only comes a single filter, you have to order the foam filter seperately. So be careful!"
1,No foam filters in my order either.,"Just confirming what 99% of the people have written...I bought this item because it was supposed to be the 2 part filter and include the outer foam. But just like the previous customers, mine arrived with only the inner pleated filter, no foam. And I bought 2...time to start the return process (but it will probably cost me just as much to ship it back) :("
1,I should have read the other reviews - No outer filter,"Just like most everyone else i purchased this expecting both filters, and was ripped off and only received one. I emailed amazon, if they dont rectify I will simply return and purchase somewhere else. Its nice to have a selection of other sellers on amazon, but they need to be held to a higher standard."
2,As all other's have stated......,This is just the inner part of the filter not the outside ring. Need to order that separate. Reviews were deceiving since some more recent no longer mentioned the fact that this is only one part of the filter. Check the date of this review--still only one piece to this item.
1,Missing Foam Filter,"This is an ongoing issue with this item. Please read previous reviews, has been going on for a while. Received it a few days ago, and its missing the foam filter. Returning item now."
3,Process Redesign - Initial Impressions,I have worked with several similar text books from Rummler & Brache and Hammer but have found this one to offer the most practical help.I thought it was very useful in defining the differences between core and sub processes and in helping novices begin flowcharting.In some areas it is clearly a summary of other people's principles and practices.For someone starting out in this field I think this book is a useful tool.
5,Great Book for Beginning Process Engineers,"This is a very thorough book that leads you through the entire redesign process. I especially liked Chapter 10, ""Document Processes"", as it is a good place to start the book. This is a very good book for process redesign training - not too detailed to bore training participants, but thorough enough to provide the trainees with a solid process redesign foundation. Packed with useful information and very, very good illustrations - examples that bring the point home. After reading this book, a good follow up is ""Business Process Improvement Workbook"" by Harrington, Esseling and van Nimwegen ...."
4,Satisfactory,"I use this book to teach business process management for the MBA class. It does not have the depth or rigor of a textbook, but does a decent job of addressing the major issues."
3,Good for process redesign team,"The authors introduced comprehensively a lot of important topics in process redesign effort, such as core processes identification and performance measurement. These are good to any process redesign team.The weakness is that there is no clear roadmap by the sequence of content in this book. Many chapaters show in-depth explanation, but looks lack of logic once put into practices. This confuses many process redesign teams."
1,Have yet to use it,"My packing list says February 2010. I'm writing this July 2012. I have yet to find a single phrase for which I needed a substitute in this book. While there appears to be good stuff inside, nearly every entry is a two-word phrase. I've tried hard to use this book, honestly, but not once, not one single time, have I turned to it for a suggestion and found the ""needle in a haystack"" I was looking for. The primary reason is that phrases are short enough that an ordinary dictionary or thesaurus often satisfies my need before I ever reach for this book. I love the idea, and the author has done a lot of work, but I found not one phrase I needed in two-and-a-half years."
2,Everything and Nothing,"Are the phrases listed in this book really equivalents? I don't think so: It seems to me that every phrase in the ballpark (and some from nearby ballparks) is thrown into a listing, whether it belongs or not.Take JAUNDICED EYE, for example. As synonymous phrases this book lists: bias, biased judgment, favoritism, green-eyed monster, jaundice, partiality, warped judgment. Is jealousy (green-eyed monster) really the same as biased judgment? I don't think so. The former is envy, the latter favoritism. And does ""warped judgment"" fit into the same category as favoritism or envy? Again, I think not. Warped judgment is more likely perverted, twisted, contorted judgment -- something that belongs in a different category than does ""jaundiced eye.""A disappointment."
5,Great book for snacks,"This book contains a lot of good dim sum recipes and are very authentic. The instructions are easy to follow and the pictures are faithful to the recipes. The recipe for potstickers or jiaoze dough I use is from this book. The har gau and shiu mai recipes are quite good as are the several others I have tried. Be warned, however, dim sum is not something you can whip up quickly. Having this book will not replace going to your favorite Chinese restaurant for dim sum. This is not the fault of the book but the nature of dim sum. There's a reason so many Chinese people go out for dim sum instead of cooking it at home--it takes time and effort to do!"
3,not bad if you're new to dim sum cooking,"the recipes in this book are quite accurate, although most fall into two categories - dumplings and buns. a very good beginner's book, if all you want to do is make some pork buns or shui mai, and for the price, it gives excellent recipes for most of the basics."
1,Loved it when I got it....,"Great little toy but really, once you've played this game for a while, you then must learn a new keyboard? Plus.. Since one drop of water can ruin any keyboard, I'd rather just use a $5 plug up."
3,make sure read the whole thing,"Key set seems to function well and works great with world of warcraft. Make sure you read the whole description because this item is just a key set for the ideazon Zboard that you need to buy separate from the key set. Space bar is two separate buttons kind of crappy because the space bar keys don't line up to well. The key set is in a enclosure and when using buttons close to the out side the outer enclosure is in the way. I give it good ratings for World of Warcraft,but for typing find something else....."
2,"did not include base, was not mentioned in ad","missing needed base plate, not happy when found out that I needed additional hardware. Was present for my nephew."
1,Don't forget to order the gaming keyboard,"The item is an overlay for a gaming keyboard. Since I didnt have the original keyboard needed, I haven't used it yet. So I rated it one star because I couldn't find in the advertisement where it says keyboard overlay. It does say keyset, which I did not know was another word for overlay. This item will not work on a regular keyboard you must buy the zboard keyboard and good luck finding one."
1,Where's the base?,"Deeply frustrated with this product, because it requires a base which is apparently impossible to buy separately. Absurd marketing."
1,Ideazon Burning Crusade Kimit Edition Keyset for Zboard,"Dear Amazon people, we have not received yet the product purchased in December. Could you please check the tracking of this product.Thanks and regards"
5,Hubby loves it,My husband is hooked on WOW and thinks this keyboard is the greatest. It makes the moves for the game so much better than a regular keyset. I gave it to him for a gift and he loves it! I would recomend it to anyone who plays WOW.
4,Porter-Cable 12379-5 3-1/2-Inch 10 TPI Wood Cutting Hook-Shank Bayonet Saw Blade,good price and fast service
1,Weak blades,"I've broken 3 of these blades already just cutting 1/2"" plywood. These blades are very narrow and meant for very light work."
2,Why Pay Twice as much for basicaly the same thing.,"I also have an Olympus D340R Camera, and I have an Olympus 16mbcard and a Scandisk 16mb card. The panoramic feature isn't worth paying [the extra money]. Instead of buying one Olympus 16mb card, buy two Scandisk 16mb cards."
3,Wonderful but not memorable,"Ray Robinson does a fine job depicting one of baseball's greatest pitchers from Christy's grand beginnings to his unfortunate plight in the end. The book gives a fair amount of detail about the game's first national idol but lacks punch because of the mostly serene nature of ""BIG 6's"" life. To the extent that the book is kind of fluffy for its depiction of a man who is nearly perfect-save for incidences like his punching a vendor during a melee-it is almost Rockyesque in that one cannot help but wish they were a personal friend of Christy.It is currently the best I've read on the perfector of the fadeaway."
4,"""damn everything but the circus""","forgot I even had this gem in the collection. you like it dirty, swampy and crunchy... this is it. all the songs are great, my fave is ""Shine"" with Astbury singing along. so grab a beer and toast the new day brothers and sisters... ""I'm just a dollar away from dyin, If I could sell my tears I'd cry"""
2,One Bunt Wonder,"I bought this disc after seeing the video for ""Heaven or(and?) Hell"" on a Beavis and Butthead rerun. Heaven or Hell is a great early mid '90's style tune, the sound and production reminds my of AIC ""Dirt"" but not as dark. I had always thought it was Alice In Chains because Jerry's influence on HH is identifiable and a real shot in the arm, musically. However, the rest of the album is much weaker and the rest of the songs are not that inspired. There are at least 2 more songs worth listening to, one with the unmistakable Ian Astbury. I don't know if the album is still in print but any Alice fan would probably be happy with it just for Jerry's contribution on the one song."
1,Very Disappointing,"This is dispepsia posing as analysis. The author has identified real issues, particularly the effect of what he calls the ""managerial state"" on democratic institutions. Rather than dealing with those issues in an intellectually honest fashion, however, he simply rails against aspects of modernity which he evidently finds distasteful or uncomfortable (e.g., the degree to which individual freedom and personal autonomy are currently protected by the courts), and does not hesitate to distort history and philosophy in furtherance of ideology. After reading it, I wanted my money back."
1,So Confused,"I had to buy this... thing... for a college course. One A and three years later, I still have not figured out what it is."
1,NOT a cotton boppy cover,"this cover is deceptively called a ""cotton slipcover."" in fact, it is 65% polyester, 35% cotton. i will be returning it and keeping the organic cotton cover instead."
5,Very cute,I bought this slipcover for my Barenaked Boppy before I knew whether I was having a boy or a girl. Her nursery was done in safari animals since we didn't find out until she arrived. This is a very cute neutral slipcover.
5,So cute!,"Very cute cover-I like it better than the ;uxe pink one I had for my previous child. This looks great in my infants room, and has washed really well. So soft!"
3,Cover was fine but Dont Care for the Pillow,I don't care for the Boppy pillow but I felt bad giving the boppy cover a bad review. It's a good cover doing what it needs to do but not impressed with the Boppy Pillow at all. Read my other review if you're interested in why.
5,Children's book about all the things that good animal fathers do for their offspring.,"The Very Best Daddy of AllThe Very Best Daddy of All is a children's book about thirteen different animal daddies, and one human daddy. Each two-page spread shows a different animal daddy and single child, along with a description of what each daddy does for his children. Fish daddies build houses, wolf daddies comfort crying pups, and fox daddies take care of mamas so they can care for kits.Admirably, all of the animals in this book are factual examples of good animal fathers and include lesser-known instances such as playful prairie dog fathers and fearless frog fathers. The soft illustrations have a sleepytime fell to them, and make this a good bedtime book. The Very Best Daddy ends with a human daddy and his son, since no one but a child's own daddy is the very best of all."
2,Not what I wanted,"I bought this book for my husband for his birthday to read with our son. It is boring and not endearing. There are many more books about daddy's that little ones will get hooked on. I really like ""Just Like Daddy"" that I also got on this site."
4,Sad,"I never knew that a country as advanced as Great Britain had ever done something that caused such pain. Just shows that government, in almost any country, is more often the problem than the cure."
3,Interesting,An interesting bit of social history about children separated from parental past and transported from UK to Australia where they matured unhappily in often harsh cirumstances. An English social worker goes back and forth from UK to Australia to try to repair the now adult childrens' self esteem. An OK film for those who appreciate this genre.
4,Moving,"Emily Watson,thats all it takes.She is one classy actress.And can i just say Hugo Weaving was SO great.I forgot I was watching these people,i felt like these were people i could know and love and I wanted to.The world doesnt have enough movies like this being made and its a shame.I had no idea there was a child holocaust like this. Shame on people."
1,Son disappointed,"The scooter was advertised to go hours without a rechare. It only last about 15 minutes. Also, the air goes out of the tires. Very dissatisfied!"
2,This book is not who Nicole really was,"Nicole has and continues to have a major impact on my life each and every day. This book is not needed to make Nicole more real to us. To make Nicole more real listen to what her family has to say about her and look within yourself. Nicole is watching over me and I know she would be dissapointed if you looked at this book and thought that it typified her life. Nicole was a beautiful, vibrant, caring, very real person who has a spirit that still lives in all of us when we look deep enough to find it and identify with her. She is not the person this book portrays."
3,Decent memoir from another point of view.,Faye Resnick writes abotu her friend Nicole Brown Simpson's murder and explains why she feels that OJ Simpson is guilty of her murder. It doesn't delve in depth into the relationship she had with Nicole not is it in depth with Nicole's with OJ.The book itself sounds like a court testimony. Not that that's bad. Just go into reading this book knowing that.
2,The lifestyles or the rich and idle.,"Poor Faye Resnick. I really feel sorry for this lady. It must be a hard life, being a Beaverly Hills socialite. At what restaurant do we eat? Who do we have affairs with? Can we go to Cabo San Lucos next week? Such are the mighty questions Faye asks in her book. All that stress must have forced the breakdown of her marriages and the cocaine and alcohol habits.As the previous reviewers have already noted, there is not much sympathy for this kind of lifestyle.I read this book for the simple fact of gaining some insight into Nicole's husband. O.J. is indeed a great actor. His facade has masked what he really is. In this, the book suceeds in giving some glimpses of a very troubled person. At the same time, it gives a poor view of the lifestyles of the rich and idle."
1,Pure Trash,"""Lovely"" Faye jumped on the bandwagon after the murders to publish this trash as soon as possible to gain notoriety and profit. She sure did not do her so-called best friend Nicole any favors.Part of this narrative is spent in praising herself, at the same time she paints a picture of promiscuity, lesbian encounters, drugs and party, party, party. Where are their kids when these damaged and selfish women are out partying, sleeping around and drinking, and she has the nerve to paint herself as a good mother.This book is disgusting and so is Faye Resnick."
1,what the (bleep)?,"I thought this book would be a chronical of Nicole and OJ's relationship from the get-go, and how things eventually devolved to the sad state they were in at the end, but instead, it focused more on Faye Resnick's scatterbrained rantings about restaurants, clubs, sexual partners, vacations, and utterly soulless, vapid ""friendships""...all provided in non-chronological order! There was relatively little information about the relationship between the famous couple: strange in a book that purports to be about that very subject. I feel sorry for Faye and Nicole, because I come away from reading this disjointed, rambling, bizarre account of seemingly disconnected events with the impression that both of them were seriously emotionally damaged women. So at least that was conveyed well."
4,Painfully truthful,"I despise people who trash this book, saying that Faye must not have been a friend to Nicole by writing such a book. Let me tell you: they are wrong! Faye was not violating secrecy and friendship by writing this; she was exposing the horrors and tragedies Nicole faced, and even more, warning women of today. By writng this, Nicole's best friend helped women by sharing a story filled with suffering. I believe this was a noble act of love for this woman to help others with her friend's own experience."
4,Great Music - But Only Album Tracks!,"""The Long Way Around"" is the opening track and second single off the Dixie Chicks' much acclaimed and Grammy awarded album ""Taking the Long Way"". The single is extremely catchy and has some great lyrics about non-conformity. I was surprised to see that it did not make the singles top twenty.""Lullaby"" is a quiet acoustic song, also taken from the album.3rd track is the pure country ""Truth No. 2"". Why they chose a song from the previous album ""Home"" is a bit of a mystery, considering that the album contains no less than 14 tracks. A non-album track would have been nice, and most fans of the group will have the three songs already. I'll subtract one star for the lack of new material. But of course this is still great music."
3,Just okay,"Not a memorable book. I read it because it was one of the books on Rosamunde Pilcher's ""book list."" Not of the Rosamunde Pilcher quality as I thought it would be."
5,Popcorn that always rates 5 stars,"Don't be fooled by look alikes, this is the popcorn popper for you! Even with almost daily use, this amazing machine will last for years. (Run the top through the dishwasher occasionally to thoroughly clean any oil residue.) Each kernel pops to an incredibly light and lucious taste treat with a minimum of oil. With a light drizzle of melted butter and a sprinkling of salt, it's dessert at our house! The movie may be a disappointment, but the popcorn will be fabulous!"
2,Not that great,"1. The popper works as advertised in 3 minutes with almost no unpopped popcorn.2. I used several of the movie theater pouches. The result was disappointing.3. The corn was chewy.4. The taste was adequate but not special.5. The popper is of very lightweight aluminum and bends easily..it warped a little out of shape at the lid after only two uses.Maybe I received stale pouches, but this was a big disappointment considering the huge number of positive reviews.Note that the secret ingredient in these theater pouches appears to be an oil blend with coconut oil. Note that the saturated fat per serving is 42% and per bag is 210%...gigantic and hardly average.I find PopSecret Homestyle actually to be superior and certainly comparatively healthier."
5,And I am not a popcorn lover,"Great popcorn, more quickly than microwave and because you use your own ingredients you make it as healthy as you want. A review below called this flimsy. It does appear flimsy (thin aluminum), but this is our two-year old's favorite helmet, space saucer (he sits in it while we spin him around), drum etc. The thinness improves the ability of the pot to heat evenly without scorching and after four years of frequent use and abuse it still is in great condition. It can definitely take a beating. I never liked popcorn (either too oily or no flavor), and my husband is thrilled that this machine has gotten me ""into"" the stuff. I even crave some of the recipe flavors at times."
2,These reviews are false,"I maintain that these positive reviews are advertisements. This is a thin, cheap device that makes average popcorn and a mess."
3,Old Fashioned way to spend money,"If you're looking to buy the clever nostalgia it is selling, shake your pan like grandma did."
1,Gets old real quick.,"Want to know how many Uranus jokes you can pack into one CD? Then buy this--otherwise, avoid it like the plague. Little Jewford wears out his welcome real quick, and even the arrival of Kinky Friedman (the next governor of the great state of Texas) can't rescue this ill-advised project."
4,was very good,was very good am now on the third one would reckmend to any mestrey reader will be waighting for his next mbook
4,Reading for the whole family,Another great McManus book. I would recommend for the whole family to read. Light easy reading. Can't wait to see what happens next in Blight County.
2,McManus newest lacked humor,"Bought this book for my hubby who is a HUGE fan of Patrick McManus humorous books. This one was very different, mostly serious and not what he expected. He was disappointed."
2,Someone's Kidnapped Pat,"I like the author's short stories as much as anyone. However this book proves he should stay away from full length books. First of all this book has none of the usual humor of his other work. It just a flat dull read. The main character is a smug little twit. He's apparently dated every woman in his county, which just goes to show how desperate rural women with no options can get. His lawman job is a sinecure he inherited from dad. The dad is also a character in the book and a living legend in the county. We know this because the author tells us, not because old pop ever does much. As our hero was preparing for a date with yet another unlucky target of his desire I just reached my limit and called it quits. I'll finish the book when I'm as starved for entertainment as the average resident of the book. No on second though I'll never get that starved."
5,Another Great Patrick McManus Book,"This book is great, as are all the other books written by Patrick McManus. One reason I think his books are so good is because I have had the same, or very similar, things happen to me in the great outdoors.This book is more of a mystery. It combines humor with mystery for a great story. I only wish McManus' books were more frequent."
2,Short and skimpy,"This small booklet is really much smaller in content than it first appears, because it is composed of multiple articles and speeches given by Ezra Meeker, many of which are essentially duplicative of the others. The story is an interesting rendition of Ezra's attempt to stimulate interest in marking and memoralizing the Orgegon Trail, which he first traversed as a youth. It's quick, easy reading, but doesn't give much depth of detail. It appears like a Readers Digest summary of a bigger book. Suggest you look elsewhere for more complete works by Ezra. However, the very low price may make it an interesting and worthwhile bargain."
5,"Great Product, but read on....","I recently purchased an Olympus digital camera and took the suggestion from one of the reviews and purchased a floppy adapter. I'm very happy with it! It makes downloading pictures much easier, and can also be used as a general purpose, large floppy disk. In fact, I use it much more to transfer files between PCs than as a camera accessory.My recommendation is to buy one, but NOT this one! Again from one of the Olympus reviews, I found the real manufacturer of these adapters--a company called SmartDisk. You get the same thing for $20 less, plus if you use SmartMedia cards, you get an 8MB card included free (at least as of 2/20 stated as a ""Limited Time Offer""). I suggest you check it out!"
3,Works great - Beware of batteries!,"I bought one of these units and it's true that you can use it with supplied software in 3.5"" floppy drives. The con: It uses (2) internal disk batteries and they have a short life. Possible better choice: A memory card reader - either parallel or USP. They are very fast and the files show up as a hard drive on your computer."
2,Too High Maintenance for my Taste!,"It works as advertised, and if you want a quick way to downloadyour work, this will do the job. The trouble is getting it startworking! Took awhile to get everything installed correctly and then I had to keep popping the floppy out and back into the drive so the software would be reminded to look for the presence of the special floppy! Probably does this to save the battery, but it is irritating. I have a 450Mhz Pent III, I hook the camera in direct and have no problems. I could have done without this pricey accessory, but I may be glad when I am trying to save stuff on my clunky old company issued laptop."
2,Nice Catalog,"This book is a nice catalog of coasters, but little else. Not very substantive. Rutherford's later book, The American Roller Coaster is a much better value."
2,Not Very good,"This book might have been good when it came out, but now is just outdated. Some of its facts are wrong, and the writing is somewhat crude for enthusiasts. The pictures are wonderful though."
3,Mainly Wooden Coasters,"This book's main focus was on wooden coasters, so if you are not too excited about wooden roller coasters, don't get the book. The book does have quite a few photos, however. There are some steel coasters; such as Steel Phantom and Alpengeist, but there are more wooden coasters. Overall, the book was pretty good; it provides a comprehensive overview of many of the roller coasters found in the US."
4,Great Images,"Fun Calendar , my son loves roller coasters, this was a gift for him.shipping was fast. Every month has a great coaster picture."
5,Great Fusion Fun !,"I think this is one of Mclaughlins best and one of the best fusion albums of the 70's, along with Return to forevers Romantic Warrior, Al di Meolas Elegant Gypsy and Weather Reports Heavy Weather. All great masterpieces and incredibly fun music.Mclaughlins playing is great and so are his compositions, full of passion and intellect and all the other players are top musicians. Johns fusion is a mix of rock, blues, jazz and indian music (with a dash of pop in one song). And all that creates a higly original blend which is his trademark.It's great to live in a world where musicians like Mclaughlin create healthy pleasures in a cd form, thanks John."
3,not mclaughlin's best but still good,"This album is good but out of all the lp's he recorded in the 70's, this one is closer to the bottom than most. The playing is exceptional (as with all of his albums) but the production sounds rather slick in a bad late 70's/early 80's sort of way. Mclaughlin enthusists will probably like this one but this album shouldn't be one's first foray into Mclaughlin's music."
3,Future Teacher,It is okay if you are ready to sit and just take test after test. As far as knowing your weaknesses it was great at that. The only problem was in their explanation of your problem areas and how to study for those individual areas. I would recommend this book as one step in the study process but not the only step.
1,Do not buy used books online,It was received with loose pages and 1 page was missingit was highlighted all over with yellow and orange ink.I will never buy a used book or magazine online.
4,Great Overview Study Guide,"This book reviews all sections of the General Knowledge Test. I used this as my main study guide for about 2 weeks before taking the test, which I passed... well, so far, I know that I passed 3 out of the 4 sections. I am still awaiting my essay score. Nonetheless, this book helped me prepare for the structure and content of the test. I recommend it be used in conjuction with REA FTCE General Knowledge, which helped me prepare for the tougher reading section of the test. The actual test matched the format of the full length exams in the Cliffs version, except on a computer screen.I gave Cliffs 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons:1. They should update the book to more current.2. They should make the reading section a little bit harder to reflect the actual test.Other than that, I can assure you that if I did not study with Cliffs Test Prep version, I would not have been as prepared for the actual test.I hope you find this review helpful... Good Luck!!"
3,2010 Takers Please Read,"This book is pretty good for the GK reading and modern grammer rules part of the test however, do not purchase this book if your weakness is math. I recently took the math portion of the test and failed. The questions this book provides are outdated and the 2010 version of the GK math is updated. I'm still trying to find a book to help me with the math. It definitely is not and will not be this one."
2,no way,"not durable at all, used it a few times worked well at first then started having problems with readings and the sound for continuity started fading away till no more, product has been in my tool case so it gets tossed around allot but not too often and now it does not work. poor quality"
4,Excellent meter for beginner electronics enthusiast,"I've been using this Velleman DVM850BL meter and I can say it works great. For the price you get a lot of features, including bonuses like an audible continuity test, diode test, transistor test, and a replaceable internal fuse. At this price point, it's a great meter for a beginner electronics enthusiast. It is non-auto ranging, which I like. The construction is sturdy and well made. Pair this meter with an extra set of test leads such asBanana to Minigrabber Test Lead Setand you will have yourself a great setup for your digital multimeter needs. The only downside I've seen is the lack of an auto-off feature, but that's pretty minor. Overall this is a great meter at a bargain price. * Edit 2011-11-28: fixed incorrect wording due to autocomplete mistake. Should read ""replaceable fuse""."
4,just what I need,"This product is the perfect balance between:-good price-acceptable quality-minimum requirements for the equipment-reliability of the product.if you are looking for a mix of all these, do not hesitate to buy this device.if you want something more professional, then you should get another, but this meter serves both for the hobbyist, student, and those small tasks that require basic data of electronic and electrical power, because this device is trust full for those tasks."
1,Poor Quality,"The first dolly I received had a defective caster. It would bind when pivoting. (The 3 other casters pivoted freely.) Amazon promptly exchanged the dolly (good service).The second dolly had the same problem. 3 good casters, one bad one. Amazon paid for a replacement caster obtained from the company that distributes the dollies.I used the dolly intermittently for approximately 3 months with no problems. Tomorrow I'm moving my household. I tested the dolly 20 minutes ago, another caster has seized.I disassembled a bad caster and found the bearing races were made from metal that is too soft. A race will splay and allow bearings to ride up on one another.I would rate the dolly zero stars if possible. It's unserviceable."
4,great foundation,"This makes a great foundation for a soap box car. All you need is the main basic body to place upon it, secure it, then paint it. Rolls pretty good with the wheels."
5,JET 1401906 WDC-3018 HARDWOOD DOLLY W/CARPET ENDS,THIS IS A GREAT VALUE! WE HAVE USED IT SO MANY TIMES AND IT IS ALL THAT! GET ONE AND SEE
1,Dated and disappointing,"This book promises to teach you how to ""Globalize your business with digital and online technology"". Unfortunately the book was first published in 1998, so the information is at least four years old. Furthermore, the author is much too pedantic for my tastes. (He begins chapter 1 : ""In the eigth century B.C., when Homer wrote the The Odyssey ...).If you are interested in expanding to international markets via the Internet, this book is unlikely to help."
4,Very Practical and Useful book,"This is one of the Best Works in DOE I have come across apart from the book Statistics for Experimenters by Box, Hunter and Hunter"
3,"good, but overrated","+ well-written+ good examples- this is the 6th edition, and it is far from being that perfect !(the author should extend / clarify some sections)- the errata on the author's web site are no longer updated- the price"
5,Pretty Good Experimental Design Textbook,"I really liked reading and learning about Experimental Analysis and Design from this book. I think it is pretty well paced, and quite well illustrated with many examples. I addition, the author also provides an online space with further expansion to the ideas presented in the book, as well as digital resources to all the data used in solved examples, as well as question problems. I strongly recommend this book for anyone with moderate statistical backgrouns, wishing to learn about experimental design and analysis."
1,Zero Practical Value,"This book is long on formula derivation, and short on DOE theory. It does not introduce readers to DOE software packages like it claims either.Also, very poor on real life examples. They exist....but not enough details in order to understand them. I am looking to teach a corporate class on this....too bad the book doesn't come with the professor."
5,"Outstanding, updated and excellent","I have used this book in my class on Experimental Design since 1997. Among all the texts I have tried to use to make the teaching of this subject more precise and understandable, this book from Dr. Montgomery have proven to be the more appropriated. The book has new exercises, more teacher resources, and is now more software oriented, something that I found very useful for my students in Dominican Republic."
4,MASTER REFERENCE for DESIGN OF EXPERIMENT,"I use this book for two years and I think it is a master guide for you on Design of Experiment.Just the matter, is this book doesn't show you too much about Taguchi Method; also it may be not enough case studies."
4,unexpected,"When I purchased this book I didn't have a clue what it was about, but I had just read a book written by Mary Sheldon and I had enjoyed it tremendously, so I bought this book. This story was very slow paced but I must say it was never boring and well the end really shocked me.Overall rating from 1-10:I rate it a 8."
4,Works Nicely,"Works great. Took it with DGL, and stomach symptoms eased after about 20 minutes. It eased my pain until I could see my doctor (which took me a week to get in)."
2,So far not working,I've been taking this for almost a month and I still have to take a antacid pill every day cause without it I still have symptoms.
4,Good product,Good for people who suffer from stomach acid. I has worked on me for the last couple of months.
3,Where is the thrill in this thriller?,"This book is billed as a pyschological thriller. It certainly is psychological and psychiatric. I was not gripped by the book to the extent that I could not put it down. By the time, the killer was revealed, the thrill was gone. The book is full of psychiatric lingo. The reader, who is not familiar with the language might be left in the dark. Then there is the issue of medication. Now how many people really know what risperal is? And you the issue of the labeling of people. For example, my diagnosis was described as ""she was trapped between overwhelming emotions and a profound sense of emptiness."" Basically, the book consists of Molly Katz trying to make sense of the baby sociopaths of the world. Are they born that way or was there some sort of event that brought them to that point? The book offers the reader a window into world of adolescent mental illness."
5,Probably end up buying more,"Bought them for my girlfriend, she seems to like them. They feel well-made, fit her well, and look good on her."
1,Mediocre with inappropriate illustration!,"The story is average - what I thought this book had going for it was the fun pictures. We bought it used, but then half-way through are a series of illustrations of a pirate ship with a busty naked woman on the front - not just a carving, but one with facial expressions etc. I would not recommend this for school-aged children at all. We threw it away."
1,Own 4 of them. 3 have failed,"In over 20 years of buying drives from every manufacturer on the planet, these drives and this company are the worst I have ever seen. I bought 4 of them long time ago, and 2 failed in the first year. Awful drives, lame company. I am a Seagate man now (again) and I'm quite happy :)"
1,Not reliable,"Had this drive for just over 3 months when it just died on me. No noises, no warning it just wasn't there any more. Contacted WD & they quickly gave me a RMA# & I had a replacement 2 days later. While there service was fast they didn't seem to care that their product had failed so quickly just here's your replacement drive. They also stuck me with paying the return postage on their defective drive & that make me feel used. Should have stuck with Seagate as now I have a new replacement drive that I have absolutely no faith in."
1,Failed after two weeks (like the other reviewers said),XP started sending errors today into the system event log regarding the disk starting to fail. Hopefully it won't die before I'm done backing it up. I'm sending this back for a replacement (just in case there's actually a good one out there). Don't buy WD. Others had told me this but I didn't pay attention when I bought this one (it was a good deal price wise).
1,western digital hard drive WD2500 - forget your data,I bought a LaCie extern hard drive 500GB. I didn't t know that it contains two Western Digital Caviar Harddrives. LaCie failed after few months. I installed the two Western Digital hard drives directly in my desktop but they are completely dead.
1,I didn't order it.,"I ordered a 2.5"" WD2500BEVS drive on August 20. The seller, D S Miller, shipped this instead. I am still waiting for them to take it back."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I have a Dell XPS 600 computer, and the SATA version of this drive was in the computer. The hard disk failed at exactly 12 months and 2 weeks (2 weeks past both the Dell and WD warranties). There was no warning, no noises...just a complete failure. The BIOS stopped recognizing the drive altogether.Unfortunately, most of my recent digital photos were on that computer (I know...it's my fault for not backing them up...I know better). My drive should reach a data recovery service tomorrow. I'll update this post if any of my data is recovered. (please, please, please).Again...avoid this drive at all cost."
5,EXCELLENT,"Easy to use, easy to clean and makes delicious popcorn. Every popcorn lover should own one, just as easy as microwave popcorn, but more economical and better tasting!"
5,This is the best way to make popcorn. Period!,"As a frequent chomper of popcorn, I can honestly say that I have tried popcorn from all the various popping methods that exist. This popper is NOT difficult and is VERY fast. The aluminum pot conducts the heat from your stove VERY quickly and, before you know it, you have perfect, un-burned, thoroughly-popped popcorn. After I dump the popcorn into a large bowl, I use the pot to quickly melt some butter to top-off the snack. It truly is not much more effort than tearing open a microwave popcorn bag and waiting for it to be done. In fact, if you care about the quality of your food ingredients, making popcorn with the Whirley Pop is WAY better than all the junk they add to mircowave popcorn (read the ingredient label!). Enjoy"
1,Nurstoons,"I was very disappointed in this collection of cartoons. With all the positive humor happening on a daily basis in nursing today, I found this collection to be very negative and at times offensive. I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,Gritty Indie Film,"If you are looking for a gritty indie film, this is the movie for you! I am impressed with any movie that can make me like a main character that I know I should hate. Dan Glaser did so much with his first film and I cannot wait to see what he produces next! I am also stoked to see more of Steven Molony and Timothy Meyer!"
1,Nothing New,"Have you seen Snatch? How about Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels? Then you've seen this movie, except with competent writing, directing, and acting. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage."
5,Very Informative.,"Good book on the day-to-day lives of 19th century citizens. Seems they desired ""material"" stuff as much as modern-day folks do."
4,"Great, if a bit uneven in spots.","It's obvious the Destroyer series is back on track. This book isn't the best Destroyer novel I've read, but it is by no means a bad book. There's something for almost everyone here--some great scenes with Remo doing what he does best, some great scenes with Remo and Chiun doing what they do best (whether you feel that's bantering and annoying the hell out of each other or killing, they're both served up in spades here), a treasure hunt, clones, hints of things to come, twists, turns, cave-ins...whew!...) I look forward to reading more from Jim Mullaney. Way to go, Jim, ya dun good."
4,Remo and Chiun tie up the Neo-Nazis of IV--in classic style.,"A fitting conclusion to a trilogy that gave us more of the classic Remo and Chiun. An insightful peek into the House of Sinanju, a treasure hunt, clones, Nazis, killings--all are present and served up in the style that true Destroyer fans crave including the Yin/Yang of Remo and Chiun's father/son love/hate relationship. The magic is back in the series--and the ending gives us enough clues to see that more is on the way!"
4,"Great music, so-so remastering job","As other reviewers have stated, this set contains absolutely top drawer live performances by Benny Goodman's great 1937-38 big band, as well as excellent trio and quartet tracks. If you like swing-era music, you won't go wrong here. And, as other reviewers have stated, the sound of this CD reissue is not what it could be.I have a dub I made from the 1950's vinyl issue of these tracks, and it sounds much better than these CDs. The chief problem with the CDs is too much filtering of the high end, in order to reduce surface noise from the original disc sources. But the noise of the originals was quite acceptable to begin with, and the filtering used on the CDs takes away a lot of the definition of the sound. The result is not horrible, but the superiority of the LP issue is plainly evident in a comparison.If you can't play vinyl, then by all means check out this CD set. But if you can play LPs and are willing to hunt down the original LP set, that's the way to go."
1,Grammatical errors and mistranslations,"This otherwise useful book is marred by a number of grammatical errors and mistranslations. For example, on p. 281, ""Wait for the tone"" is translated as ""Espere por el tono."" It should be ""espere el tono""--the translation in the book means ""wait on behalf of the tone."" Tax return is translated as ""reembolso impositivo,"" which actually means ""tax refund."" ""Workers' compensation"" is translated as ""compensación de obreros,"" but it is actually called ""indemnización por accidentes de trabajo"" in Spanish. ""Sexual harassment"" in Spanish is either ""acoso sexual"" or ""hostigamiento sexual,"" but not ""acosamiento sexual"" as indicated in the book. ""Final decision"" should be ""decisión definitiva,"" not ""decisión final,"" which means ""last decision."" ""Listen for the alarm"" is translated as ""escuche por la alarma,"" which means ""listen on behalf of the alarm."" The bottom line: be VERY careful with this book."
5,Super Sweet! Excellent player. Ok remote.,"I love this dual disk player. I had originally baught myself a Toshiba SD 3108 for christmas and gave to my mom when this one came out. The remote is plain and large, but the dual tray and sound quality are excellent. I am most pleased with Toshiba's DVD players."
2,"Well, it's o.k. ... if you don't ask too much of it...","I have had this player for close to 3 months now. It has performed well until now. With the release of Disney DVD's, I have begun to notice some flaws. First off... Hercules (I've exchanged 3 times) freezes in the middle of ""Zero To Hero"" (Chapter 17). Next off, Mulan... at least it plays all the way through except for the sound fading away in some sequences. I guess if someone asked my opinion, I would say, ""better get an extended service contract and keep your Disney on VHS"". As an after thought I would mention that the Hecules DVD ran fine on my PC-DVD drive."
2,"A poorly designed, unreliable DVD player","I've had this player for about six months. About 15% of the DVDs that I own have at least one feature that can crash this player, when that happens the only way to reboot it is to hit the switch disk button, none of the other buttons will work. The remote control design is pathetic, half of the buttons are hidden by a cover, and are virtually inaccessable. The skip and fast forward functions are combined on a single key, to fast-forward you must hold down the skip button for several seconds, if you don't hold it down long enough it skips to the next scene. The skip backwards function doesn't work, it can only return to the start of a scene, not an earlier one. So if you accidently skip to the next scene you must restart the movie from the beginning."
3,"Nice design and solid build, but not the best for normal CDs","I got this at a Goodwill store for a bargain price recently, mainly to function as a CD player. I am using the analog 2 channel audio out to my stereo, and wanted to use this player as my default CD player (instead of using my PC). For the HDCDs, this player is fantastic, they sound amazing. Sadly, normal audio CDs sound really distorted on this. I have played around with the settings, including the Audio CD Attenuation option but either way it was not great sound. I have heard before that HDCD players are known for oversampling CDs because they try to make 24 bit sound from a 16 bit disc.The DVD has component out, digital optical out, video out, s-video out, and 5.1 audio out as well. Very advanced output options (including 16:9), I just wish the normal CD playback was better. If you have a huge collection of HDCDs then this is a great player, just dont even bother playing standard audio CDs on it."
5,Great Bang for the Buck,"This player is hands down the best value in it's class. The SD-3109 offers more features than any other in it's price range. The most usefull feature is the dual tray...you can watch two movies back to back without getting up, or use it like I do and keep your most used Audio CD in the lower tray so it's always available. I had purchased a Yamaha RV-902 (digital ready) over a year ago, and I was waiting for the right DVD player to purchase...this one was it. The 5.1 audio blows me away every time I play a DVD. You will want to see every movie you have seen on VHS just to hear the difference. The video is crystal clear with no jitters or flutters. The remote is lack luster, but it does the job. This player is highly recommended."
3,"SOUNDS GOOD, BUT NO VIDEO","I RECENTLY RECEIVED THIS DVD PLAYER AS A GIFT. I AM HAVING THE HARDEST TIME GETTING IT TO PLAY. WHEN I HOOK IT UP TO MY TV I GET SOUND, BUT NO PICTURE. WHEN I HOOK IT UP TO THE VCR I GET PICTURE, BUT NO SOUND. IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS ANY ANSWERS PLEASE LET ME KNOW."
2,Not really happy.,Purchased it to use mainly as a CD player with video thrown in as an extra. Using the analog outputs I hear a small pop between tracks. Do not hear this when using the digital outputs and a seperate D-A converter. When watching a DVD could not get 2 channel digital output.
1,junk,I bought a higher end Toshiba DVD player last year. I only used it about 20 times before it crapped out. After shipping and repairs it cost me another $100. Buy another brand.
4,DVDelightful,"Purchased my Toshiba 3109 (...). I had shopped for approximately a year, studying all of the features, brands and options. I saw a deal that I could not pass up and I am very DELIGHTED that I own a Toshiba DVD player.Especially this 3109 model. The dual tray feaure is perfect, I'llsit two discs in the tray and then relax with the remote and watch hours of movies.The only thing I wish it would do is play cdr."
5,Exceptional Sound & Video Quality. Easy to Learn to Use.,No complaints from me on this player. I hooked it into my Yamaha theater sound system and it rocks! I had no trouble learning to use the remote and each of the functions (skip and FForward included)...total of about 5 minutes and I was doing everything necessary from the remote. Highly recommend using either the S-Video or Optical outputs to get the best possible video.
5,Outstanding Picture Quality,"I have been extrodinarily impressed with this player. I spent a few years shopping for a DVD player while using a PC with a decoder card to pump DVDs out to my TV. While I used to think that my Creative DVD decoder had outstanding picture, I really didn't know what I was missing.The SD-3109 has amazing color and black levels, and it has worked with every disc in my extensive collection and every rental I have tried. Using the optical out, I have experienced no signal dropouts or the like.I have read some negative reviews of this unit (which are in the minority) and I have not experienced any of those reported troubles. As many have stated, the only potential negative has to be the remote. I don't think it is a BAD remote, it is just a little blocky and wide when held.I can recommend this unit without any reservations."
5,Quality! Quality!,"I purchased this player, and I've been very happy with it. My DVDs play perfectly on this player unlike my Sony 550, which has lip sync problems. The video output is simply gorgeous, and the expanded black levels provides for deeper color saturation. Plus, it has two DVD trays for those extra long weekend DVD sittings. Audio performance is also quite excellent, not to mention its HDCD capability which allows it to rival audiophile CD players."
5,Best DVD Player - I did my research!,"Great product! I will never go back to VHS. This unit has the AC3 5.1 Digital Sound Decoder built right in, in case your stereo does not have the decoder built in it."
4,Good picture,"Good picture. Remote very poorly laid out. NOT multibrand, only controls the DVD player."
4,Nearly Great,"I've had my 3109 for about 2 months. Picture and sound quality are excellent. CD playback is very good, although I think a brand-new first tier cd player might be slightly superior.Although Toshiba claims you can play CD-R disks on this unit, you better test your disks on it before you give up your old CD player. My disks (recorded with a Phillips OmniWriter) will not play on the 3109.The remote control has a hidden panel for certain features which I find inconvenient. And it's not the fastest loading player in the world.But all in all, given the excellent picture and sound quality, and all the the formats (DD/DTS/HDCD) it supports, it is a very good value.If I had it to do over again, would I buy it? YES."
5,A GREAT ENTRY-LEVEL DVD PLAYER,"I just got my player yesterday. I loaded The Matrix and The Mummy and it worked perfectly! I had ordered another player before this and it couldn't even read the DVD's! Everything you'd want in a low-priced player is here. I have a DTS amp and the sound is INCREDIBLE! This is how movies should be seen in the home. Of course, having a rather large TV doesn't hurt either. The only lame thing is the remote, but since all I'll probably do is hit play and sit back, my receiver's all-in-one will do just fine."
2,Works great... but broke in under two years,"This DVD player worked beautifully for the first year and a half. Then it started having errors when a disc was inserted... which I was able to live with, and get around after playing with it for a few minutes. Finally about a month ago it got the point where it would no longer recognize discs when I inserted them. It loaded the discs (mechanically speaking) just fine - but it could never seem to track to the start point of a disc.So I finally broke down and took it to Best Buy for repairs. The estimate came back as $300+ to repair a bad laser assembly. Only about $60 of that was labor, so the parts were unbelievably expensive!!! You can buy the unit new for less than that - which I do not recommend to anyone."
5,An Amazing DVD/VCD/CD Player For The Price,"I've searched high and low, every site on the net that I couldfind, trying to get the most bang for the buck, with all of thefeatures that I wanted of course. All of my research led to this beautiful piece of electronics, the Toshiba SD-3109. This player has great picture quality w/ the 3 optional hook-ups (component being the best), and perfect dolby digital sound, with decoder built in (optical out being the best way to take advantage of it). The hardware has been absolutely flawless, after 2 months of use so far. It is very easy to use and control too! It plays VCD's and CD's wonderfully, and is the only DVD player under $2000, at the time of this review, to play HDCD's. Now ask yourself, what more could you ask for in a DVD payer."
5,rock solid,"I was initially set to spend a lot more for a DVD player, assuming that it would be hard to find one of high quality for less than $400-500.However, after reading many reviews and talking to friends who already had DVD players, I chose this one - not for its low price, but for its quality to price inverse ratio. It has lived up to its hype since the day I unpacked it and set it up (in about 4 minutes); looks and sounds brilliant, without any problems whatsoever. Truly a great deal."
3,Mine must be defective!,"I got mine for Xmas... It can only play two DVD's that we have so far. The player ""fades"" out video on two discs we have so far: Austin Powers and Saving Private Ryan. It will play Tomorrow Never Dies and Warner Music Group Does DVD Vol. 2. I don't know what's causing the player to screw up on those discs."
5,"Great player, great price","If you hold the skip button for a moment it goes to 2x, tap it again, it fast forwards to 8x, and once more for 30x. I am only 15, and it took me two minutes to figure out the basic commands. Of course you need a reciever to get dolby digital and dts. This player has very good picture and sound quality, and is very easy to figure out. If you cannot figure it out, do some research or read the book that comes with this player. I have encountered zero problems with this player. Thank you for your time."
1,no high speed scan makes this DVD a NO SHOW!,"After purchasing this unit from a trusted dealer who recommended it I was amazed to discover that you cannot scan forward or back at more than x1! Try getting 20 minutes through a video with very long (or no) chapters (e.g. the 'Making of' video on the 'Shining' DVD, jumping back to an earlier part of the video to look at something again, and then trying to get back to where you left off 20 minutes further in. You can't do it without sitting through the rest of the video again! Unnacceptable in my book. I returned it immediately and bought a Sony DVP S-530D. Now I discover that unit has a serious lip-synch problem on the second layer of dual-layer DVDs. Several of my DVDs are unwatchable on it because of this. Consumers deserve better than stupid usability and technical flaws like these."
4,Just works fine,I have been using this player for about 2 months. The dual tray feaure is good for watching two movies one afer other or watching VideoCD's which usually in multipole disks without have to get up and changing disks. The remote is different from other units and could have made much smaller
4,Audio output,"I bought this DVD player for the purpose of video playback, but it has also replaced my cd player. The soundstaging and detail level of the sound is very good, as well as the timbre reproduction. The HDCD availability helps this player to sound better than most DVD players. The biggest drawback in the audio is the bass. In the lower frequencies, the bass almost disappears. My cd player was a Marantz cd63, and this DVD player is better in almost all respects, except for the bass performance."
5,Great addition to homeschool library!,"I am a homeschool mom, and trying to teach my 15 year old algebra that I don't remember was a real challenge until we started using this book! The practice exercises really make him think and I love that the answers are included. This book should be titled ""Algebra the Fun Way!"" My thanks to the authors."
2,an OK book,This book didnt get straight to the point. Not a good book if you need quick help. This book is geared towards younger teens but seems like its geared more towards pre-teens.
2,Misses a few points,"When I first began to study with this book, I was happy with the level of instruction. I also didn't mind the fairy tale that developed as the story moved forward; it took a lot of the scare factor out of the material.What frustrated me was that there were concepts that weren't explained very properly or at all. I'm still befuddled as to how to solve for x in an equation. They don't give you a clear-cut or definite way; they only tell you to add/subract on both sides of the equation. And that's not working for me. The book seems to make a lot of assumptions, namely, that you're also taking an algebra class and can direct the questions the book doesn't answer to your teacher. All things considered, not a good self-help book."
2,Not that easy,"I picked up Algebra: The Easy Way to refresh my math skills to prepare for a math placement test for college. As others have mentioned, the book attempts to teach you with a fantasy type story where the characters learn algebra along their adventure. I didn't mind this way of learning but the teaching is so lacking and at times completely confusing. My biggest complaint was that many of the practice problems at the end of the chapter were unreasonably hard and required knowledge that wasn't even covered in the book. I picked up Elementary and Intermediate Algebra by Angel which is a real college textbook being sold for incredibly cheap--it's a great text I recommend."
3,Sort of Confusing,"This is a book with good things and bad things. When I was 11 I had to get this book for school. I was learning algebra, but sometimes the story would get me mixed up, so that I had to read the same part a bunch of times. The story is neat and makes learning algebra a little more fun, but it might be good to expect thet you might not understand the story, and just focus on learning math."
2,Skips Material,I had to use other books on algebra to understand the book as it left out important info.
2,Agree it's best for the traditional age student,"I am also an adult wanting to refresh long unused skills. One good thing about this is that each chapter has a reasonable number of problems and answers, so it's not intimidating in that way. But I could also do without the fantasy story. This would probably appeal to a young person in JHS or HS who's taking algebra and needs to review, but I just want to cut to the chase and will be looking for another book."
3,Nice for those not so math inclined,I got this as my Homeschooled freshmans math text. I like that it is written in a way that even parenst can help.She likes the way it flows
2,Earlier Publication Better - I will not use 2003,I have tutored using earlier publications but do not like this changed version. I am seeking older publications. I do not like the changes made. Ruined the great idea.
3,Lots of Algebra Marred by Juvenile Story,"Unlike most algebra books, this one covers pretty much everything you're likely to run into in both Algebra I and Algebra II. That's nice, because you usually have to buy two books to get that much information. The down side is you have to read (or read around) a fairy tale that wouldn't interest anyone over the age of 11. So who's the target audience?"
2,Just too dumb,"Sorry, but this book is TOO childish. The storyline really isnt much of a story, the plot goes in many different unrelated directions. Maybe its just me, but I would prefer a math book that concentrates on math, and a story book concentrates on stories. I dont really want a book that attempts to do both.Thumbs up for the spirit behind this book, I think the intentions were great, but I think that even my [...] son would have trouble taking it seriously."
1,Avoid it - especially as your first ASP.NET book.,"This book doesn't even attempt to teach you ASP.NET.First of all the book is not even close to be ""A Beginner's Guide"". It's a good thing that I have a descent background in programming and it didn't take me much to understand what the author ""tries"" to say. However, I don't think that beginner could easily comprehend the content.From a teaching style that author uses you get the feeling that he attempts to make an idiot out of everybody (the terminology + explanations makes you say ""WHAT?!!!"")And of course, this book is as far from .NET as you can get. ASP maybe but not .NET. The author doesn't even attempt to take object-oriented approach in tackling the applications.Oh yeah, by the way most of the code doesn't even work."
1,waste of money,"This book is horrible, it seems to assume that the reader has no knowledge of web development at all (it has sections called ""ask the experts"" that consist of really elementary HTML questions and questions about the web), yet, if the reader has no knowledge of web development, why would they want to read something specifically about asp.net? It references examples before they occur in the book, and it seems as though the author has no grasp at all on what he's talking about. It's amazing how this book can be as long as it is without actually saying anything. Any other asp.net book is better than this."
1,Leave it alone,I tried about 5 examples out of this book and the only thing works is the debugger on visual studios telling me I have errors everywhere. Please avoid.
1,I should have read the reviews first!,"Bought this in a bookshop while browsing.This book is poorly organised and gives information too quickly without giving the reader a chance to practice. Code snippets are incomplete.Maybe there are some good things in it, but I'll have to buy another book to learn from and maybe go back to this one later.Don't buy!"
1,Not good,"I wasted several hours on an Example from Chapter 4 that I couldn't get to work. In frustration I thought I'd check out Amazon's Reviews and saw a reader says that Chapter 4 is ""way off the mark"". I wish I had read these reviews before I got this book. If the book had a website that listed ""corrections"" to the book, I would have been more forgiving and continued on but I'm through with this book. (I've never seen a book get such a bad rating from several people)."
1,Sorely disappointed,This book is a HUGE disappointment. Recipes are complicated and in metric. Unusual ingredients. Better recipes and directions when you Google Romanian Foods AT NO COST
2,Not as attractive as anticipated,"I thought this cookbook with its emphasis on art in the title would be a ""prettier,"" more attractive book, more of a coffee table type production. It is, instead, rather clunky in appearance, and the quality of the paper and artwork is not what I expected. It's definitely not a glossy book."
5,Yes this is good,"Johnson embarks on what is actually a very challenging subject. This is a stimulating and a provoking text, in which a sensible and cohesive argument is set out (very occasional slightly silly parodies aside - i think the other reviewers may not understand the slight toungue-in-cheek nature of some of these). I would very definately reccomend this book for anyone interested in music, culture, art and people!"
2,Rather repetitive and dry,"I awaited this book with much anticipation, but I have been somewhat disappointed by its contents and style.- I found it repetitive, as well as very dry, condescending and pseudo-highbrow.- It certainly has its interesting points, but these are far in between and repeated over and over again.-"
1,Taruskin got it right,"Why do classical musicians, the worst offender being Adorno, think it's ok to be almost completely ignorant of popular music when they take it upon themselves to condemn, wholesale, a vast field of contemporary music? This book would fail if submitted as an essay in any of my undergraduate courses, as it commits major fallacies throughout. The most glaring is the threadbare false dichotomy that should be well-and-truly dead by 2010.Thankfully, there are defenders of classical music who don't need to resort to straw man arguments against other genres. I'd recommend Andrew Ford's ""In Defense of Classical Music"". A good sign - this is a man who also writes books on Van Morrison."
3,Good Safety glasses/ Bad Sunglasses,I have serious dry-eye syndrome. I bought these to keep the wind out of my eyes when cycling. I later learned by extensive searching on UVEX's website that these glasses do not provide UV protection - at all. Why make dark safety glasses that let damaging ultra-violet rays pass through?
4,Fascinating Reading,"Richard Jordan writes about a subject he loves and in so doing, makes us love Mame even more than we may have from the start. Years of dedicated and meticulous research went into this entertaining history of the book/play/movie/musical and the time spent reading it just flies by.As a musical buff (if not a completely authoritative historian), I was fascinated to read so many interesting behind-the-scenes stories. And as an archivist at a major entertainment company, I fully appreciate the value in having certain long-standing rumors debunked.This book definitely belongs on the shelf of any fan of the legend that is Mame."
1,"Excellent Topic, Poor Execution","The story of ""Auntie Mame"" in her various incarnations (novel, play, musical, two movies) has great potential. The character and the actresses who have portrayed her are all fascinating. Unfortunately, despite nuggets of information that punctuate the text, this book is so amateurishly written, repetitious, and badly edited that it makes a great and compelling story seem boring. There's a great book here, but Richard Tyler Jordan did not write it."
2,"Interesting anecdotes, very weak presentation.","It's wonderful to have a book that spins some interesting backstage yarns about the various productions of Auntie Mame, but don't expect anything more than that. The recording of oral anecdotes is valuable, but the author doesn't dig very deeply into the ""meaning"" of Auntie Mame, providing no real insights into the characteristics that have kept her so popular over the years. In fact, it seems as if he hasn't even read the original novel, though he does include a last, interesting chapter on the later years of Patrick Dennis. The writing style is pedestrian and the actual text is riddled with grammatical errors and typos to such a degree that I can scarely believe that this wasn't a vanity publication. Recommended only to die-hard fans of Auntie Mame, Angela Lansbury, or Rosalind Russell."
3,We're lucky to have someone take the time to write this...,Great book. Though misses info about primary actors who did not respond to Mr. Jordan (e.g. Roger Smith/the adult Patrick in Auntie Mame/movie).Begs lots of questions about the author of it all--Patrick Dennis. May be the next book?
1,Horrible,"This is a horrible stupid movie which I bought after reading the previous reviews. If you buy it for the erotica, or vampire scenes, there's none, so forget it."
2,"It works, but it's a rip-off","This product is overpriced and under-featured. I bought one, not knowing any better. Afterwards, I discovered that it won't work on other brands of NIMH batteries, only Olympus. I tried it on some NexCell batteries (these are high-quality batteries) and the charger got so hot it almost caught fire. Also, it has no trickle-charge feature, so you can't leave the batteries in it without damaging them (the manual says 48 hours is the max). Finally, there's no 12-volt adapter so you can't recharge in the car. For about $27 you can get the MAHA MH-C240f, which will recharge any NIMH AA or AAA batteries, and also do Nicads, has a trickle feature so you can leave the batteries on charge for up to a year without damage, has a 12-volt adapter so you can rechage in the car, and doesn't heat up at all. It can even recondition your nicads (NIMH batteries don't require reconditioning). Skip this product."
2,If only,"I'm the kind of person who leaves batteries in a charger andforgets about them till I need them. I think most people are likethat. The worst feature of this product is you cannot leave the batteries in it for more than 48 hours without damaging them! I'm sorry but I've got other things to worry about besides checking batteries' charge status.The ""Universal Battery Charger (23-419)"" can do 4, and is half the cost of the Olympus. The ""Rechargeable Battery Fast Charger (23-422)"" can do 8, which, considering the way the D-340R eats batteries, you might want. It is almost the price of this model here, but with twice the capacity. Neither come with NiMH batteries.After returning the Olympus charger, I got the size 8 one and it works fine. The batteries are sold separately but you will still come out ahead.Do yourselves a favor, skip this one"
1,A very poor dollar value,"The Olympus M H batteries with charger @ $59 is a very poor dollar value, compared to the same thing #23-030 for $19.99 1/3 price"
4,A fundamental and effective introduction to the facts and theories regarding ice ages,"While some aspects of this book are dated due to the advancement of science, the main themes are still as accurate now as when it was published in 1981. It begins with an explanation of what an ice age is, and presents the evidence that there have been several through the span of recorded history. Several theories as to the cause of ice ages are presented including evidence supporting and refuting them. The author also mentions the potential for global warming, which has particular relevance to the present world.Written at the level of the middle school student, this book is a fundamental and effective introduction to the facts and theories regarding ice ages. It is a solid supplemental book for science courses in the area of geology."
1,Is this CD gold plated?,"At over fifty bucks it must be... I can't figure any other reason. It's not an import. According to Relix its a 2-CD compilation of the albums ""It Aint Easy"" and ""Everything Stops For Tea"" - two great albums - plus a few outtakes. I'd plunk down twenty bucks in a flash for this but not these crazy prices. Why does everyone think us baby boomers are all independently wealthy and will pay over twenty five dollars a disk for thirty five year old reissues? Thank god for on-line file sharing."
4,Murder Most Pleasant,"Neither Souchet's Hercule Poirot nor Rutherford's Miss Marple, Murder Most English is most definitely not one of the hard edged contemporary British mysteries with hard-nosed exteriors and complex interiors. It is a venture in folksy village crime solving by ordinary police who get the job done with a touch of humor. Clearly, a set-bound series with no goal of realism to drive it deep and dirty, it still creates its own ambiance which some of us find soothing and entertaining even though murder may be the initiating factor for the plot. It is unlikely to please those for whom the cutting edge-dramatic police procedural derived series is intended. The lead characters are well-cast, the speech for Americans not overly incomprehensible but requiring patient bewilderment as do many British shows, the plots interesting but not intense.Best to give it a try if you can before buying the series."
3,Murder Most English,"I buy many British TV series and although this one is from an earlier period than most of them, the stories are clever and well done. The audio sometimes fades in spots and it's hard to hear. However,the main characters don't seem to fade out. The picture has a somewhat faded look but no more so than any old color TV show. The star is a well know British acotr and is understated and great fun to watch.."
2,Murder Most English,"Atrtracted to this because it was close captioned (very few Acorn products are, but that is another story/complaint for another time) and Christopher Timothy as one of the performers (loved in in All Creatures . . . ), but the video was very disappointing, the plot and dialogue almost bordering on the silly. And the music was enough to drive one crazy."
4,most English in the extreme,"This series was intended as a serious detective story. If you expect an ordinary detective program, you will be disappointed. The characters are eccentric in the extreme and the plots are contorted and obtuse. Some of them defy the laws of physics.You will probably enjoy this if you like Monty Python and the Carry On movies. If you are disturbed by non-realistic aspects of a program, you will not enjoy it."
2,Not what I expected,"I have purchased MANY english murder mysteries on line, but this was my first dissapointment, too much like daytime soap opera.Having said that, the product was delieverd just as promised and on time."
3,A hard one to define,"Slow and droll certainly, but equally witty and subtle. British in the extreme. It is different and it is eccentric. This isn't Midsomer or Morse, Cribb or Poirot. It will not be to every British murder mystery fans taste. This one perhaps requires an appreciation of stage and theatre. Limited budget with limited sets. Acting for the sake of acting. You'll spot many British character actors from many of your favorite Brit shows. Do not sell this off beat who done it short. It's sort of quirky and fun on a long winters night... But be warned, it IS a bit different."
2,Far from the best of British TV,These films are not really up to expectations for British TV. Even given their early age for TV they do not have the quality I have come to expect of British mystery productions. A slim night of entertainment.
5,"This book beats all the other ""experts"" put together.....!","We sent our songs to all the cheap ""consultants"" in the world for direction with our music career. But this book has been more helpful than all of the ""experts"" put together. 'Bought four copies - one for each member of my band."
4,A necessity for spraying your house,"Looks just like in the picture. There is a short wooden handle about 12"" that has a pivot so you can adjust the angle. The aluminum is rustproof and cleans up easy. It is made of fairly thin guage aluminum, lightweight, but stiff. The corners are extremely sharp so be careful!! Would recommend the 36""."
4,It does what it is supposed to do!,"While the handle could a little sturdier, but it does what it is supposed to do. I do recommend this product."
2,"Shockumentaries, vol 2","This is only the second half of ""Mondo Cane"" collector's edition, and deffinitelly doesn't deserve the first half of it's title!There's nothing shocking inside.So much time Antonio Climati's work ( whith or whithout Prosperi and Jacopeti) is left out, there is nothing worth the label "" Shocking "".The only value of those wrong labeled "" Shockumentaries"" from Vol 1 and Vol 2 is Historical. And if you are interested in History of docummentaries, the buy all the set , not only halfs!"
5,Best tea in the world!!,The orange spice tea is fabulous. It needs no sweetening and it is like having a treat!
5,orange cinammon tea,"I first tasted this tea when my daughter brought me back a package from her trip to Seattles Pike street market. I was hooked from the first cup. Its rich, and tastes like very high quality tea. It was expensive, but worth every penny. I make two cups from one teabag with no problem. Love it!"
3,A Sequel That Lets Down,"Dirty Harry was A Great film, Magnum Force was even Better, But the Enforcer lets down. It has to deal with revelutionary Kids Who kidnap the Mayor, and only Harry Can get him back.This is not a good movie but still watchable for the alcatraz climax"
2,The Enforcer - 1976,"The third and extremely predictable Dirty Harry film. Eastwood's image and character as the tough San Fransisco cop is unconvincing this time around. All that's happening in this low-key movie is that Harry is out trying to get a small force of criminals with a powerful rocket blaster. He's partnered with Tyne Daly, who's not too bad. Yes, he's still got the .44 Magnum that Dirty Harry's remembered for."
4,"""Dirty Harry"" cleans up San Francisco","This second sequel (out of four) to ""Dirty Harry"" is a good companion piece to the original, with Harry adjusting to a female partner (a competent Tyne Daly) while dealing with terrorist thugs threatening to bomb San Francisco. Harry is more hard edged than in ""Magnum Force"" and there are some wonderful scenes here, like when he foils a liquor store robbery by driving his car through the store window (after the punks demanded a getaway car) or when he questions a suspect while smashing a toilet plunger in his face. Tough cop Frank ""Fatso"" DiGeorgio (John Mitchum) has his last stand here. Lalo Schifrin's score is sorely missed, although he returned for the next two sequels. The terrorist group here is pretty forgettable, as they don't make much of an impression as screen villians. Exciting climax shot on Alcatraz. Enjoyable action fare, especially for fans who found Harry too mellow in ""Magnum Force""."
2,KINDOF BORING,"This movie really isn't that much fun to watch....I think Dirty Harry and Magnum Force are much better. There are some good scenes in it, but the acting and storyline just isn't as good as other Dirty Harry movies."
3,The worst Dirty Harry,This movie is probably the worst of all the Dirty Harry movies but you gotta admit it is an orginal set-up. First you have Harry Callahan who doesn't seen to work well with others and every partner he has seems to die quick. Give him a partner and that's bad. Make her a woman and then all hell breaks loose. See Harry as he tries to cope with a woman partner and try to stop a bunch of crazy people from threatening peace in San Francisco. This is probably also the most boring Dirty Harry movie also because it seems to take its sweet time getting to where its supposed to be going. Best part: The climax in Alcatraz.
4,finally THE ENFORCER on dvd!,"and it sure looks great on widescreen + it is all in its R rated glory as clint eastwood makes his 3rd film as dirty harry. he reluctantly teams up with a female partner (wonderfully played by tyne daly)as they try to wipe out a militia group terrorizing san francisco. see i use to see THE ENFORCER on TBS a gazillion times with the usual cuts for violence, sex and language. this is the 1st time seeing it uncut and wow! check out harry going undercover (as ""larry dickman"") in a brothel searching for a female militia member. it is more hilarious to what harry sees there that you didn't see in the tv version. or the classic moment where harry hands his badge (he says ""7 point suppository"") to his superior (angrily played by bradford dillman). here, harry callahan may be dirty and doing unorthodox methods in fighting crime but he is smart & knows what the hell he's doing while the higher ups, including the mayor, are a sorry bunch of losers."
3,"Dirty Harry (III) passes the macho test and delivers, but falls short of three other Dirty Harry films by a hair","Dirty Harry Callahan is back for round threeand does better than Sudden Impact, The Rook-ie, Tightrope and the Gauntlet. Female partnerTyne Daley takes a bit of time to get used tobut puts out a career best performance! Takethat 'Judging Amy'! Callahan is at his bestin conference room with idiot feminist eval-uator, who is forcing him to get Woman partner.Bradford Dillman is a stale as ever and poor'Fatso' gets offed! Great ending and best photo-graphy of any Dirty Harry film. Solid effort."
2,"OK, not quite ""marvelous""","Kindler, gentler Dirty Harry film which puts our bureaucracy-hating, crime-busting hero with a female partner played by Tyne Daly, who would later achieve fame on ""Cagney & Lacey"" and is currently seen on ""Judging Amy."" Thin plot, some classic Eastwood quotes, but the villains can't match Andy Robinson from ""Dirty Harry"" or David Soul from ""Magnum Force."" This might be the weakest Harry of the bunch."
3,"Quite bad, but quaint artifact","The acting, script, cinematography and editing are all so bad here, they almost make this Dirty Harry relic good. Eastwood's performance plays tongue-in-cheek today, though he may have been serious at the time. Tyne Daly as the rookie partner is simply awful. The plot about revolutionaries taking the SF mayor hostage is very dated even for 1976. The film overall looks like a TV show. I did like the jazzy 70s soundtrack, usually good when Eastwood, a jazz fan, is involved. I liked looking at the 70s cars."
2,Cleaner Still,"Third Dirty Harry picture feels more dated than the previous two with its portrait of crazed radicals as the bad guys none of whom register as believable or menacing villains. The picture feels more like a violent TV episode from the era. Like in Magnum Force, Harry is made into more of a conventional cop hero than the extreme personality from the first (and far and away best) film. The whole show here is his relationship with Tyne Daly as his partner. These scenes are the best in the movie and both actors deliver."
2,Going Through The Motions,Clint Eastwood must have been offered a lot of money to do this picture. Without a doubt the worst of the Dirty Harry movies. It seemed like Clint was doing a parody of himself. The only saving grace is Taye Daly's role as a rookie detective that gives Harry a run for his money. There are also some good oneliners. The next Dirty Harry film Sudden Impact is a major improvement.
4,BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER ''MAGNUM FORCE'',"THIS TIME, HARRY [CLINT EASTWOOD] AND HIS NEW FEMALE PARTNER [TYNE DALY] SET OUT TO BRING DOWN A GROUP OF TERRORISTS. THE PLOT ISN'T REALLY ANYTHING SPECIAL, BUT THE ACTION IS GREAT, THE ACTING IS GOOD, AND IT'S JUST FUN TO WATCH. IF YOU LIKE CLINT EASTWOOD AND/OR YOU LIKED EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO DIRTY HARRY FILMS, YOU'RE BOUND TO ENJOY THIS SEQUEL. IT'S WORTH BUYING IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY BOUGHT IT. FOLLOWED BY SUDDEN IMPACT."
3,"JAMES FARGO, OPUS 1","**1/2 1976. Directed by James Fargo. Well, who says that a director is of no importance if we have a star in the movie ? Certainly not me. Take this Clint Eastwood movie for instance. You've got excellent actors here and a good screenplay but admire what we have in the end: the weakest of the Dirty Harry movies. Thanks to James Fargo who doesn't have the slightest idea where to position his camera and who is unable to give any rythm to the action scenes. Too bad."
2,Bad angle,"Skimmer is a nice large size and the holes are well-placed and also of a a good size but the problem is the overall shape. I bought this to skim the ""scum"" off the top of broths/soups without scratching the interior of enameled cast iron. Instead of an angled spoon or scoop shape, this thing is shaped more like a tennis racquet, which makes it awkward to use and hard to actually get far enough inside the pot to skim the surface in anything less than a huge pan nearly filled to the top. Even in a 6.5-qt pot with a very wide opening it's difficult to skim without having to climb atop the stove to reach around the entire pot. The shape is probably better-suited to straining fried foods from a deep skillet (or, ya know, tennis), but being made of nylon makes that a really bad idea.It seems to be made of very nice material and cleans easily but, unfortunately, it's just not good at doing the job for which I bought it."
3,Works as advertised,"This slide copier works as intended. I hooked mine to a 50mm lens with a 49mm face, and using manual controls on my Pentax K-5, got suitable digital copies. The lens on the copier (of course for the price) is not of best quality, and some fuzziness results around the edges of the digital image. There will also be some minor ""noise"" in the image. These things can be corrected with appropriate software in post-processing.For ""quick and dirty"" copying of old slides to digital format, this device works quite well."
3,Lowest cost - OK quality,"Clearly Huot has striven for the lowest priced drill cabinet. The plastic cell dividers are unfortunate, but if your careful this cabinet should be adequate. Doesn't have the well built feel of other Huot products. Cle-Line C23992 is all metal but the added $30 may not be worth it."
5,Great quality. Made in the USA!,I was very pleased with the quality of this drill dispenser. How many of us have a box of assorted drill bits. This is the answer and it is affordable!
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed in this book it was too simplistic I guess it is good for beginners. The book is too big. The photos are all black and white not color and somewhat dated if you ask me.I own the three Itatations books and they are beautiful. This book was not worth the price I paid for it. Very colorful cover is misleading. Oh well....
3,It's what we danced to at the start of the 90's!,"With ""Two to Make It Right"", ""Clouds"", ""True Love"", and ""You Take My Breath Away"" (featuring a surprisingly good lead from David Cole) as the standout tracks, the rest of this compilation is routine ""retro disco"" from the time period.The pair is better represented on ""Gonna Make You Sweat"" and ""The Ultimate C & C Music Factory""."
3,House Music all night not,"For the price you cant beat it! But on half the songs dope, other half are ok! so its 3 and a half stars ***"
1,Don't bother!,"Don't bother to waste your money buying this dvd. The sound quality is very poor. It sounds like it was recorded in a barn. The reason to buy such a dvd is to listen to these singers and it doesn't deliver. Also, all though the dvd shows these various entertainers singing one of their hits- they are not necessarily show stoppers!"
4,a life saver,"I would give this book 5 stars in a heartbeat if the dosing were a bit more precise. People who do not know that this extraordinary help is available are seriously handicapped. My family has used homeopathy for decades with stunning success. It is downright criminal that doctors and dentists are ignorant of the most basic remedies like arnica, ruta, ledum and hypericum. Criminal."
5,Amazing music and lyrics!,"I too am a 51 year old mom who just found this band. It was the Free Hugs youtube video that introduced me to them, but I love the Dressed Up as Life cd. Every song is phenomenal. I don't know what you wouldn't enjoy about them unless you don't like the emo lyrics on some of the songs. I highly recommend them to everyone except young children and hope they release a new album very soon. I know they are touring this summer and wish I were 30 years younger so I could go listen to them live. Check out their live videos on Youtube. My favorite song on the album right now is What Are You Looking For. If you're looking for another great band along the same lines as Sick Puppies, try Smile Empty Soul. Not as great, but very good."
5,little bit of overkill,"Not quite sure that i needed this much of a trap just to remove a beaver from my pond, but it definately did the trick."
4,Solid Batman Story,"While The Batman Murders is nothing like Knightfall or No Man's Land, this is a solid story. It grabs you from the beginning and the portrayal of the Joker is amazing. It is a simple read, but you'll want to finish it once you start. The only problem I felt was there wasn't very much action. But I would recommend this to any true Batman fan."
3,Super Reader,"A competent Batman novel. The book is set a few weeks after A Death In The Family. Confused people dressed up as Batmen are set up to be murdered, and Batman investigates.He is still having a lot of problems because of the death of Jason Todd. When a cult recruiting young people swallows up a police officer sent undercover, Batman asks Nightwing for a hand. Nightwing goes undercover, and encounters a few problems of his own.The cult leader is a used car salesman recruited by The Joker, who is up to his usual psychotic shenanigans."
3,Pleasantly surprised...,"Normally I only read large books with complex plots. Occasionally I take a break and read something...well, lighter. This was a quick, fun read. I enjoyed the story and while it was fairly predictable it was never disappointing. If you can find this book, it is a fun read..."
1,"Bad Ideas, Bad Execution","This is not a good book. Its thesis is poorly formed, and the execution is terrible. The author's views are not well explained, and the discussion shows naivete, arrogance, and a deep ignorance about war, peace, and the middle east. This book only muddles the complex issues involved. This reader was quite surprised that a relatively respected press agreed to publish such nonsense."
4,wow....,"I'm giving this 4 stars because I want to give Mr. Jones someplace to aspire to for his next album. And I hope there will be a second offering from this talented musician. The tunes are at turns romantic & hard driving, which makes this an album that takes some listening & growth time- which are always my favorite kind. Mr. Jones' voice is full of personality & emotion: a rare & lush treat. A new & unique musical voice in every way. I'm addicted. If you're a fan of Dylan, Wilco, Jon Brion, etc.... this is a must hear."
5,"The Essence of Alan Watts, The Year 2000",I have written my review today 4/1/2000. I did not finish my biography review list. I want to make sure that you put me on the biography review list so that people can contact me by my e-mail address. Pease do this for me. Thanks!
5,Love these bottles!,I used Avent and Dr. Brown for my first daughter and did some research about bottles for my next baby. She loves these bottles and so do I!!! She is not gassy at all!
5,Must have,"These bottles are a MUST HAVE for your baby. Less spit up, less belly aches, and you'll never go back to those other brands."
1,Cute but not functional,"I bought these and quickly returned them. Seems that a design team had all the looks in mind for this product but not functionality. These things leaked so bad that I wasted a lot of milk!! I tried re-tightening the lid and bottom. I used each bottle thinking just one was not working. Nope all the same. Messy, messy, messy and not worth it!Try the Soothie bottles. We love those!!"
4,Perfect for breastfed babies,"My daughter is primarily breastfed and prefers nursing to the bottle. Unfortunately, I had to go back to work sometime. So, these bottles are great. They're the closest thing I've found to the breast and the ONLY bottle my daughter will take without having a total meltdown. I nurse when I can but these are great for Dad to do a feeding or when we're in public. The downside is you must be careful when you're screwing on the bottoms or you'll end up with a lapful of milk."
2,BPA free but poor design,"I bought these bottles because they are an inexpensive BPA free option. However, I am very disappointed. There are 5 parts (6 if you include the lid) to this bottle. If not put together just right, they leak! The bottom of this bottle screws on. It has 2 parts. The liner must be put in the bottle just right and then screwed on tight. The nipple must be pulled all the way through (you'd think that'd be easy to tell, huh). If either of these areas aren't put together right, WATCH OUT! Oh, and be careful trying to tighten one end while holding the other. Nothing like a lap full of liquid!One other thing, this bottle takes longer to warm than other bottles whose bottoms aren't as bulky.I would not buy this bottle again. There are other alternatives that are much easier (and BPA free) for a busy Mom to use."
3,"Good sound, hampered by poor build quality","For starters, this portable cd player has excellent sound quality. The esp works fine under normall bumps, but I had times when the player would skip, with the esp on, when the player was still and there wasn't any sighs of scraches in the cd. I've had mine for about a year and the paint, all over the player, has rubbed off to the gray plastic! It has it's flaws (major ones) but I still use it for the great sound quality. The features on it are great, but there are a few that we could live without like the automatic volume limiter."
3,Good sound but something wrong with it.,"I bought mine in the wall-mart for $79.Look,sound, ESP ""worked"" but only on a half it suppose to be.Sometimes it skips when you walk or even sit.I allways thought that sony make the bast things.Maybe now I would by Ponasonic or Aiwa"
1,If you take anyone's word for it: take mine.,"I purchased this same discman in New York city, and the first problem I had was that the sound come sout very softly: even with the little sound switch in the back turned to ""normal"". The second is that mine does not recharge the battery... I was deeply mislead into buying this because I thought the ""Sony"" name would guarantee some level of quality. NOT a good buy."
1,no sirve,"esta bien chafa me lo regalaron hace un año y empezo a dejar de oirse la musica, ahora no se oye nada, shame for Sony."
2,"10 seconds of skip, not 20!","After doing alot of research on my player I've found that it has only 10 seconds of skip protection! Don't believe me, try it. Put in a disc and use a pen or something to put in the lid indicator. Play the cd, and then without moving the indicator, remove the cd while it's paying. You'll see that the music only plays for 10 seconds after the cd is removed! Remember that Sony says on the packaging, that it proforms beter than it's 20 second players. It never advertises that it has a 20 second esp!!!"
2,The Sony Discman is a bad choice in the long run.,"The Sony Discman has its benifits, but is a bad choice for the long run. I have owned two of them in a 9 month period, the first failed to play within the first three months, and the seconds ESP didn't work after two months and after 4 more months ceased to play at all."
5,GREAT CD PLAYER,This is the best cd player I have ever bought. It came with all the features I wanted and is just all around great. It is easy to use and the battery life is great too!
1,"Shame on you Sony, for even selling this inferior product!","Shame on you Sony, for even selling this inferior product! I returned mine after one week!"
1,It is so bad!!!,"It never works, I had to trplace it 50 times and it never works!!! Don't bye this sony, buy an aiwa or pioneer or even panasonic. I used to have a panasonic and the sound is so mch better on it!!!!"
2,Good price not reliable,I reciever this cd player for christmass from my parents i picked it out because it was a sony and it was inexpensive. When i got it out of the botx it was ok but after that it went down hill it skiped when i hardly would touch it and somtimes it would skip when it wasnt evern touched. I returned it and bought a panasoinc my advice is spend the few extra bucks and get a quality cd player.
2,"Skipping, but where are the Bumps?","I bought this CD player, for what I thought was the best skip protection that was out there and great Sony sound. The sound was good and it did not skip at all..... For about 2 weeks. Then it would skip when I did not even hit a bump! and it got worse till I returned it and got another one (that was just the same) and it did the same thing! It makes me very upset, and i wish they would fix this problem."
2,Pales in comparison to its predeecessor,"Years ago, Sony made the best Discman there was. I had one from about 10 years ago that was great. It weighed a ton compared to this one, but the sound was immensely superior. I couldn't believe my ears when I hooked this one up to my stereo system through the line out, the sound was so thin. Not at all rich and full like my old unit. And the feel of this new one made me think it wouldn't last ten weeks, let alone ten years. Shame on Sony for cheapening down such a good product. I packed it up and took it back. And my brand-loyalty for Sony has taken a major hit."
2,Perhaps the GSM breaks some IC?,"I'm a weeny bit dissapointed by this Discman. The italian packaging comes with a ridiculous pair of earphones but I already had a couple of good ones so that's not too much of a problem for me. The trouble is that it doesn't seem to withstand e.m. waves radiated from a GSM phone placed close to it. It's the second unit I change and after some time (notably after an interference from the GSM occoured during a previous playback) the CD just spins down for no particular reason shutting off the unit (that means that the unit could have just managed to survive prolonged vibrations or that it could have been left sitting peacefully on a desk!) Now, I will get another unit for replacement and stick it in a Faraday bag but the idea doesn't please me at all! Nevertheless, it's aeons better than a Thompson CD player I originally intended to buy, but still: looks too delicate and it could be the first victim of GSM e.m. transmissions!"
4,positive charges,I found this book helped me be more positive. It contains 544 statements of positive thoughts on making the most out of life. I leave this book out and reread it often.
5,The man himself,"Here is the man in his own words in letters to his daughter, his king and his friends. Much from A Man for All Seasons is taken from these letters. Wonderful!"
3,MIND OF ITS' OWN,"Lives up to billing on resistance to kinks and has good solid fittings. Water delivery volume is very good. The trade-off comes as a stiffness difficult to control among flowers and other plants when hand watering. Some plants become casualties. I prefer better handling and would tolerate some (infrequent) kinks. It may not weigh more than others of similar dimensions, but I perceive it to be heavier due to its' unweildiness."
4,First Time Dehydrating so far so good,"Received the dehydrator on time. Original Pkg. Good size for home dehydrating, light in weight and it has everything I need to start the process.This is my first time at dehydrating anything; started with fruit and is in the process as we speak (or as I write this review)I check the trays after 3 hours and is looking good. I have mangoes, kiwi, and bananas.I think is going to work out very well, have to try other things and become very familiar with the machine.One thing I notice is that the brochure does not tell you the temperature you are supposed to use, unless I missed.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 starts is because I have not used it enough to make any other comments. I will write another review later when I have used it more.I will recommend this product.Happy in Charlotte NC"
5,Great dehydrator,I just purchased this dehydrator. I have been wanting to purchase one for awhile and finally did it. I did some research online to decide what to buy. This one was highly recommended on many websites for its great temperature control. I have only used it a few times - I have dried bananas and made fruit leather. It will get alot more use this coming summer. It has been extremely easy to use and clean. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
3,failed on 3rd use-Amazon to the rescue,"I wanted to buy a dehydrator that cost a little more and had more to offer than some of the more cheaply-made units available. I used it a total of 3 times whereupon it decided it didn't want to heat anymore. Company says it is warrantied for 10 years... but I have to ship it to Canada to get it serviced... I'm not happy with this purchase.After my initial disappointment, I contacted Amazon to get a return authorization... they immediately shipped another unit and paid to have the old one returned. That is why I love to buy from amazon.com."
1,"Electronics fried after 20 batches, company email/#'s disconnected/bunk","It worked great, until after about 20 batches, the bottom tray melted and electronics crapped out. With a 12 yr. warranty and ~$140 purchase I expected I'd have a dehydrator for life, wrong. I tried all the phone #'s, even a Canadian one, all the email addresses and they are all bunk/disconnected or don't even exist. Interesting the site appears to still be selling items though, hmmmmm. If anyone has had success with an issue like this, I would love some suggestions. -Aa"
1,Defective Do NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I purchased this item 6 weeks ago. It just stopped working 2 days ago. It never dried properly. The bananas were sticky...even with a longer drying time. Now the heater stopped totally. Do not purchase this item. I have learned the Excalibur is the best.
4,"So far, so great...","I have NO complaints and I like this a lot, however it is only 3 weeks old with 3 uses, so far. Hopefully I will NOT experience problems with power, sensors, heat etc...*** I was able to fit 10 lbs (total) of teriyaki and a (spicy) HOT batch of jerky. It came out GREAT!I am very careful and sensitive to the dehydrator, therefore hopefully it will last me many years... The only reason I did not give this a 5-star is reservations about future problems based on other reviews (keeping in mind I have only had mine 3 weeks).That said, I have made some GREAT BEEF JERKY that everyone loves! The cost of making YOUR OWN jerky versus store bought is HUGE! You save a lot making your own."
2,error in documentation,how can you have 12 square feet of drying area when the dryerhas dimensions 16.50 inches x 11.50 inches x 10.00 inches?YOU CAN'T
1,Do not buy,I bought this on 6/1/2011 have been using it once a week - today the bottom 2 trays have melted. For the money I paid for this it should have lasted much longer - I am very disappointed and will not recommend this to anyone.
1,disappointed...,"After reviewing numerous dehydrators, I thought I had found the perfect one for my husband and his fondness for making excellent hamburger jerkey. It was a Christmas gift and he was pretty excited. Unfortunetly, It will only heat to about 125 to 130 degrees. I know this model had 'rave' reviews but no matter, we can't get it to function at the 150 degrees that it promises."
4,"Very, very useful item","I've had this dehydrator for at least a year or two and have no complaints. I use it to dry lavender and other organics I use to make natural soaps. I dry apples and orange peel(and lemon) and other fruits we use in breads and pastries. It's great for drying tomatoes for salads or whatever. Hey, I like it."
2,L'Equip 3062020 500 watt food dryer,"Not sure how well it worked.The description stated 12 sq. feet of drying area,you are lucky to get 8 sq. feet at a time. They counted the 2 fruit leather mats.I already own 2 other fruit dryers and needed a larger one. Was disapointed and send it back."
1,ok except the dehydrating trays for fruit rolls melt!,"Works fine other than that, but since I bought it to do fruit rolls I need to get another one.Come up with better fruit trays!"
4,Good guide,"I have used this guide to find dirt roads and admit that it is easy to read and the roads suggested in the book matched the description I found once on location. This guide is one of the very few available for such backcountry travel and the author deserve credit for putting together a good guide for CA. Combined with a GPS, it is practical without being ultra precise or over-complicated. It is after all a family oriented travel guide and therefore simple and accessible. For the ultra perfectionist, getting satellite maps or other high definition topographic maps may shed more light on top of this basic guide"
1,Maps missing trail information,"I have to admit I really enjoyed the book upon receiving it. But then when I actually looked at the map detail on a couple trails I was preparing for, I noticed the colored trail information was completely missing. In other words, the trail was omitted from the map page on 3 of the 50 trails inside the book. Naturally, it was on the 3 trails I was seriously reviewing for trips. Page 87, 95 and 105 have no trail lines printed. I am sure this is a printing error. I sent an email request to the MFR for a replacement copy to be sent to me at once. Once I receive feedback from them, I will add the resolution information to my review."
5,Worth Reading,I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in true life thrilling experiences in Bolivias most strangest jail.
5,Best book I have read this year!,"I don't give a book 5 stars to often, but I have to say this is an excellent book. I couldn't put it down and finished over the weekend. This book is written very well and makes you want to keep reading. The fact that all of this is true makes it so much more interesting, also the pictures that were included were a nice touch. It just made the book that much more real. I would definitly recommend."
4,An Amazing Insight,"For anyone from a western country thinking of travelling to South America, Marching Powder provides an amazing insight into one of the harshest elements of Bolivian society. Like all good books, it is a good read and also educational. There is no glorifying of international drug trafficking and no sentimentality about the results if a person is caught and imprisoned. One of the best books I have read in a long time."
3,Good read but certainly not outstanding,this book is a pretty good read. i enjoyed it but it wasn't a page turner. i'm not certain i believed all the incidents described and i think the writer embellished and downright lied at certain points for the sake of entertainment. still it is interesting and if half of what was written is true then it is a fascinating glimpse into prison life in bolivia.worth a read but don't expect to be riveted.
2,A times you have to 'march' through the run-on chapters,"Pretty fun book to read, but at times it went on and on. I would have omitted some of the sections of the book - just not all that interesting. Was hoping for it to be a bit better, but happy to have finished the book today.Like some of the others said, I think the 'true' story is not really all that."
5,Not a review,This books was excellent.I wonder how Thomas is doing today. Where is he living? What does he do? Did he get together with Yasheeda. :-9
4,"Why is the book called ""Marching Powder""?","Cracking read, crazy scenario.Did I miss the part where they explained about the meaning of ""Marching Powder""?"
3,Overcoming Brain Damage: It Is Possible,"Mr. Schmelzkopf offers up wit, humor, and optimism to an otherwise serious and debilitating condition that is brain damage. His anecdotes throughout the book are down to earth and proves that it is indeed possible for a person who has had brain surgery to get through the difficult days of therapy and once again lead a normal life. This book is a must read for all patients recovering from brain surgery and their families."
3,Needs Update,"I bought this book with hopes to show my kids around Dallas area. Well, some information in the book were outdated, and some others were no longer there. I would like to see the author rate each place by ranking them. This guide otherwise gave me a good place to start."
1,bad seller,The seller sent me the wrong item and then after numerous phone calls has not called back or made any attemp to get me the right windshield. I would never buy from them again.
3,expensive hand lotion,"this looks great next to the sink, but it's pretty expensive for what it is: heavily scented hand lotion. I wouldn't purchase again."
3,Cucina hand cream review,"I like the hand cream but found it too thin but the smell is wonderful. Would I buy this again, no. It's overpriced."
5,Cucina Hand Cream,"Who wouldn't like this product? It's perfect for cooks, as it doesn't interfere with food item flavors. The fragrance is fabulous!"
1,Will NOT help a child about to move.,"I guess it has simple language that a new reader could read. But I bought this book to read to my daughter to help with our upcoming move. I'm glad I read it myself before reading it to her. It does NOT teach a child how to make friends. First, he goes around town asking 'Who will be my friend?' and only adults respond to him. They agree to be his friend, but none of them has time to play right now. Then, this poor kid goes to the park, asks to play, is rejected, then starts playing by himself. It is only after the other boys see that he is good at throwing and catching the ball that they allow him to join them. That is not very instructive."
4,"Not p.c., but hey it's fiction!","Freddy moves into a new neighborhood and looks for new friends. A classic 60's story, which appeals to every child, lovely pictures, and an easy read for pre-schoolers. Will they care that there are only white boys in the story? That Freddy wears a bow-tie to the playground? PG advised!"
5,Superb,"Is the sun yellow, the sky when clear blue? Well, Jane Roberts is like that in that she writes great books. I left this review in the present tense for a reason. You'd know it if you read her books. ;-)"
4,An alternate view of God,This book gives an alternate view of just how directive God is in our lives. Jane Roberts explains her Catholic upbringing and how she has now formed a very different view of what and who God is. In this book and her other books (and Seth's books) she goes into a detailed discussion of the nature of our existence and how we determine what happens in our life.
2,Somewhat pricey,Buying this kit will save you some time but you can put together your own kit from seperate generic components and save around $20.00. This includes buying an 8 meg Smartmedia card versus the rather outdated 2 meg card included in this kit.
4,Not-so-gulty pleasures,"Once I realized that Time-Life's ""Singers and Songwriters"" series could have been called, ""Soft Rock One-Hit Wonders of the 1970s,"" it was inevitable that I'd get these discs. These songs were the soundtrack of my youth, and if they are for you too, then I can't imagine a more cost-effective way to get them than this. The liner notes help contextualize the songs within the culture that birthed them."
2,"Read Batya Gur's ""Literary Murder"" Instead, I beg YOU","I've enjoyed Kate Fansler and her detective work, so I jumped to buy this book, just out. Woefully disappointed. There is no depth of character, not in the narrator nor in Kate. There is no ""sitting at the edge of your seat"" (or bed) here. It's all tedium punctuated by long disquistions on being fat. Very definitely not up to par. Ironically, I had recently re-read some of Batya Gur's mysteries. In hers, there are echos of P.D. James'--with those wonderful multi-layered characters who are fascinating unto themselves and not one-dimensional, not boring. I hate to damn a writer that I've enjoyed over the years but this is simply NOT a compelling read. The writer was clearly tired as was her prose. Sorry to report the above, but look elsewhere for good mystery and high drama."
1,Burned-out Writer Steals Plot,"I have been an avid reader of Cross's work, and so was bitterly disappointed by her most recent novel. She must have been out of ideas because she stole a famous Agatha Christie plot. It was obvious to me about a third of the way in. That Cross gives credit to Christie by actually having the two detectives watch the movie that was made from the novel may have assuaged her conscience, but it made me want my money back. The plot worked barely in Christie's exotic setting. . . in the English department of a small college worked it was completely lacking in believability."
1,Bored out of my mind,"This was my first Amanda Cross, and my last. The main character in this book detective Woody is pretty much incompetent and continues to talk about her size, which starts to get old around page 30. I did not really care about who killed the professor, and pretty much found all of the characters in the book uninteresting. I couldn't wait to finish this slow story to move on to something I actually wanted to read."
4,"I like Woody, but wish Kate had a larger role.","I'm new to the Kate Fansler series having only read one previously, and I really enjoyed Honest Doubt. Although Woody seems to dwell just a little too much on her size and everyone else's, the description of small college politics is good, although a little extreme. I did find the incessant harping about the lack of tenured females a little trying. It is a valid issue, but presented badly. Overall, the mystery is good, the characters interesting, and I look forward to reading more novels with Woody as a central character."
2,Expensive AC adapter...,"This adapter is available in 'generic' form from several camera stores (wolf camera, for instance) and is much cheaper. However, if you *MUST* have the Olympus name, this will work. I've plugged one of each into my D450Z (great digital camera!) and there was no difference. Save your money, if you can."
2,little disappointed,"great bands of the Metal Extreme, all so brutals,but I hoped much more of Necrophagist, more songs,I buy this dvd for they,I feel a little disappointed"
1,Horrible,"Not even close to what I expected. I thought maybe 2 songs from the support bands, fine. But the whole setlist of necrophagist at least. No only 2 songs from each band. Amazing production values, but overall not worth purchasing."
1,COMPLETE RIP OFF,"wow, what a waste of money this turned out to be.what's wrong with it you ask? well let me count the ways:1. bad song selections2. only one decapitated song with poor sound quailty(and they dedicate it to vitek, shameless and disgusting)3. no arsis even though they put thier name on the cover4. jump cuts every 2 1/2 seconds5. poor extrasneed i say more"
2,Not Really Worth the Money,"This DVD just really isn't what I expected. To bring up what's wrong with it in a nutshell, too short, each band only plays a two song set, only one interview with any of the bands (Cephalic Carnage). About the only good things on this movie are the sound quality and the camera work. Other than that I can't say that I'm overly impressed by this movie in the least. Plus, some of the songs that were chosen for the bands sets are not their best titles."
4,"Good CD, but his Sun sides are better","Like his friend Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins signed with Columbia Records after leaving Sun. While Cash had continued success after the move, Perkins was not as fortunate. However these songs are still very enjoyable & Carl sounds like he had a great time recording them."
5,Awesome pattern book,"Ever since I came across this book at our school library, I have been wanting to own it so that I could keep it in my classroom for years to come. My students absolutely love this book, especially when the shark appears, and they really get interested in learning and creating patterns of their own. I encouraged the library to get more copies so that more teachers have access to it!"
1,Power Loss Problems,"This unit was a real pain to install but the real problems started after install. The fan and light turn on at random times without anyone touching the remote. We live in a rural area prone to power outages and every time we lose power, when the power is restored the light turns on to full brightness. Since this fan is in a bedroom and we occasionally have momentary outages at night, quite a few during rainstorms, it functions as an unwanted alarm clock. I will try to return the unit, but it will definitely be replaced."
4,Hunter quality,"Having installed six ceiling fans, both Hunter and competitors, I really needed a remote to control the fan in a vaulted ceiling without fiddling with chain controls. The wall switch was nice, but inconvenient. The best way to install this remote is to really read the instructions and determine wiring/lighting details. I did not change the dip switch settings, but you may wish to if you have other remote devices. (Either way, make sure both transmitter and receiver have identical settings). Yes, there is cramped quarters for the receiver. I suggest installing the receiver into the holding bracket first and then wire the leads. It might be beneficial to trim back excessive leads to make room for wire nuts and during installation of the cover plates. It took me longer to review the instructions and determine the wiring pattern I had to deal with (Hunter remote with a Hampton Bay fan, but I would install again."
5,Baby Neccessity,It is great to be able to order this in bulk onl ine! Thanks for being a life saver!
5,Underappreciated artist who is remarkable song writer.,"Terrific song writer and warm voice. I first heard Mike Reid on Kirk Whalum's album ""In This Life"" as he wrote and song the title song. His voice is like that favorite sweatshirt that you always reach for, and his songs reflect upon life in that tapestry of life sort of way. There is spiritual reflection and gratitude in many of his songs but not in any sort of preachy manner.I hope the artist will continue to record his own work as his talent is too wonderful not to be treasured."
5,Voluptuosity review,"Wow, this album does not disappoint! It starts out with a funky rockin' tune and ends with a punky rockin' tune. The riffs are awesome, the beats are funky, and the band sure lives up to its name :)"
2,The author kindly sent me a well-constructed copy,"I am not good at using Amazon reviews but I wrote one a few days ago about this book. I can't find the review I wrote on this site, but maybe I am not good at this. I said the book was upside down and backwards (which was true). I'll ad mit I was not enthused with the content. Amazon did not reply to me but the author, Yali Friedman sent the 2nd edition to me with a hand-written apolgy for the poor construction of the book I bought. I think this is admirable and impressive. I will read the second edition and maybe, if I can figure out how, provide a review."
3,Not as good as others in the series,"I have purchased many from this line of books. They are, for the most part, excellent in teaching the catechism in simple and beautiful language. I use them with my 3rd grade C.C.D. class. In this particular book, I didn't like the way the wording of the parables was changed. I think it would have been better to leave the parables in their original form and add some teaching after them."
3,Kerr's standards uninspired,"Music is Her Name finds Anita Kerr and her songsters singing out the standards, such as Begin the Beguine, Sentimental Journey, Round Midnight, It's Alright with Me. While the harmony and arrangements are nicely done, this disc doesn't come close to the excellence found in Kerr's other outing of Bacharach tunes and other 70s songs. Total disc time is 61 minutes"
5,THE EARTH THE SKY AND THE SEA,I AM YET DECIDING IF I SHOULD BUY THIS CD OR NOT. MY LOVE IS HER ALBUMS CALLED...THE SEA THE SKY AND THE EARTH...WHY OR WHY CAN THEY NOT BE BOUGHT IN A CD PACKAGE. I LOVE HER MUSIC...AND MY ALBUMS ARE SO SCRATCHED. JANE MILLER
2,same old sales ideas,"After reading enthusiastic reviews I bought this and the Conceptual Selling book. A basic premise is the salesperson's ability to ask questions, and not just talk. Maybe this is a revelation for someone new to sales, but as I kept reading I found this book just restating the obvious. I've been in sales for 25 years, and this book is nothing new. Catchy title, they obviously have a lot of big name clients. Good book for a rookie though, but an insult to veteran salespeople."
2,Promises more than it delivers,This book promises to change the way people sell and to increase your success rates. Like many books of this type this is more geared to starters than professionals with sales experience. On the positive side there are some nice tips and templates that could help better focus a client/supplier relationship. I booked the book but I am not sure I got that win-win that it talks so much about achieving. Sorry.
3,Good material but difficult to read,"The material in the book is reasonably good, particularly because it is different from most selling books. What is wrong with it?1. A great deal of overlap with their other book ""The New Strategic Selling"". Do not buy both books!2. A very boring writing style. It looks like they wrote the headings and then wrote the contents because a lot of the content reads like filler - or ""waffle"".3. It is extremely repetitive, which adds to the boredom factor.4. The insistence on using sexist language. People are mostly but inconsistently referred to as ""she"". This goes as far as referring to a person previously described as ""Mr President"" as ""she"". I want to learn selling not to get a hamfisted and condescending lesson in sexist language. Hint to the authors: if you want to be non-sexist, just say ""he or she"" - people can read it fast and it doesn't get in the way.This book could have been half the length and it would have been excellent."
3,Worked great until it broke only after 3.5 hours of use,"It was a great little camera until it broke. On it's forth tape, about midway through it beeped with an error and then wouldn't eject the tape. Luckily we still had 2 months left in the warranty. Warranty repair was fast!It was fixed and returned stating ""Replaced capstan motor assy, fuse. Cleaned and adjusted tape path and torqued"".I researched the net after it happened and found it's a pretty common problem with canon camcorders. Not sure why I didn't find that info before I bought it with as much research as I did then. From what I've read, the cost to repair this problem once it's out of warranty is around two hundred.It's still a great camera, but breaking after less than 4 hours is pretty sad. It also didn't have a rough life, we were using it to film our first child. We would take it out of it's case, film for awhile and it went right back in it's case, never left the house."
2,Don't buy - Known Problem with Tape Eject,"I loved this camera until after the warranty ran out. The tape got stuck and would not eject. I had to send it in and pay for a repair. No biggie I thought, it's a complex piece of equipment, these things happen. it was fixed and worked like new. Although i use my iPhone video and my flip video camera for daily needs, I use imy Canon Elura for specific needs.I recently used it and wouldn't you know it, after 1 day (no drops or rough handling) the new tape I put into it got stuck. it's the same eject problem from before! I did a search on Google and it appears many folks have the same problem.Canon needs to ensure that the tape eject is reliable and not prone to problems before I would buy another one."
1,"RIP OFF!!! w/ a capital 'R""","DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CAMERA FROM ""Electronics Club"" IT DOES NOT COST $704YOU CAN GET IT ON EBAY FOR $80YOU WOULD BE A FOOL IF YOU BOUGHT THIS CAMERA. IT DID NOT COST $704 NEW.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
5,What a GREAT bag!,"My daughter saw this bag before Christmas and really wanted it, so I bought it for her. She absolutely loves it! It's a very well made bag....very durable and see her using if for a long time! Great material too....if it needs to be cleaned, I am sure it will wash well! Thanks for the great bag!"
1,Contains BPA,"For those concerned about BPA: Second Nature bottles contain BPA. BPA free brands include Born Free, Nurture Pure, MAM, Green to Grow, Baby Life and Adrini.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)"
1,sly guy,"Well, lets just say. I cancelled this order with the seller before Christmas(a day after I place it)and just recieved it about a week ago with no return information. He even confirmed my cancellation asking if I would like to switch it with another. Kind of peeved, but don't need to be bothered right now to ship it back. I will find someone to give it to. Originally I was buying it as a gift for a friend, but she had one almost just like it."
1,Not recommended,"I didn't expect much from from a product that costs about $6 for a set of three dusters. I should have expected less.These dusters are made out of stringy synthetic material, which would be fine except that threads fall off as you dust. These dusters also didn't pick up much dust- mostly they just moved it around. These are also not good for dusting around objects that might move- vases, etc.If you have a lot of flat, empty surfaces, and you just want a cheap alternative to a dust rag, and you don't mind little green fibers laying around after you dust, then these dusters might be for you.Otherwise, skip these and go with a higher quality duster."
4,Let's have a race!,"Now you can own Bertie the bus, Thomas' loyal friend who has always been there to help. Thomas first met Bertie when he got stuck in the snow. Terence came to rescue Thomas and Bertie came to pick up Thomas' passengers. The next time Thomas and Bertie met, Bertie challenged Thomas to a race. If you haven't seen that story, I will not tell you who won, but you can find that story on a lot of Thomas tapes. The only bad thing about this toy is that it doesn't have any magnets or anything but I guess your child will just have to use his/her imagination."
4,Bertie the bus is OK,Bertie is part of the Thomas the Train friends toys. We gave it to my 2-yr old grandson a few weeks ago. It is well made and holding up to a 2-yr old's playing enthusiasm. It has been played with daily and has been a safe and durable toy.
2,Bad Paint,My son is 2. He loves his Bertie. He got the toy in the mail on Saturday. Then on Monday the paint started to chip off.
3,Not as fun as others,"Bertie is nice to have but my son barely plays with it. It won't attach to anything else, no magnets. Like another review says, it doesn't go well on the tracks, even the the road side of the dual purpose tracks."
3,Extremely overpriced,"My only complaint about Bertie the Bus is that it is extremely overpriced. I paid $ 30 for this toy only because my son's happiness is priceless. However, there is no justification for pricing this toy three times its true value."
