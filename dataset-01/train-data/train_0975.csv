5,EcoDrive for DIVING,"Its so cool to have a sun watch.Very good for diving, but be careful, I am not the best for taking care of watches, so my glass is all scratched.If you are like me but hate scratch glass, invest in a expensive watch like TAG or ROLEX, those are stronger watches.I fall on my watch while I was hiking and didn't break so i am very happy with my tough watch.I am a biologist and a proffesional photographer who spends time in the wilderness so this watch is the best one I had, probably I don't need another watch, i like its scratches, it gave them personality ;-)I need to change the strap after 4 years of hard work and scuba diving a lot.Good price for the good quality."
4,Great value and performance again from Citizen Watches,"I've gone between a number of brands and always return to Citizen for the quality and performance of Citizen watches for the price or even compared to much more expensive watches. The dial is not the most stylish, but looks great with most outfits, and performs great in active settings. Plus solar powered and with multiple timer settings."
5,Works,"Received a 150 gallon tank that is around 10 years old and told it had a leak. Spent weeks cleaning and stripping old silicone out. Last thing I wanted was to test fill the beast and have it leak so purchased this product. 48 hours later filled tank and no leaks, can't ask for anything better."
4,Works Well And Cures In 48 Hours,I used this product to seal the leak on a uv sterilizer and it has worked very well.I recommend this product.
2,Disappointment...,"This is getting 2 stars because when it works well, it's wonderful. Problem is, most of the time now it doesn't work.I bought this to go under my desk at work to keep my legs warm. Initially this worked great, very warm, the oscillating portion was nice so that one side of my legs didn't just cook. It was wonderful. Now, the heater cuts off after not even 1 minute regardless of what setting I have it on. Even when I set it to ignore the temperature control and just blow a steady flow of warm air, it still shuts off. It has an auto-shut off safety feature for if the heater itself gets too hot, so my guess is that this regulator has malfunctioned and shuts the heater off after maybe 1 minute of use. It doesn't work if I set it for continuous low heat, continuous high heat, 65, 75, or 80 degrees...nothing works.It also refuses to come back on once this happens and I usually have to wait hours to try again, so this pretty much makes this fan completely useless."
2,Avoid at ANY price!,"I bought this heater to replace another dying space heater (Patton brand) that lasted for several years, and still mostly functions. We used this heater for around 1.5 months with several issues, however, when it worked it worked well (hence the 2 stars).The first issue we had around two weeks in was the unit would shut off and stay off, even when the room was freezing cold. It finally started functioning normally again after about a week. It worked for a while after this, but the oscillation would make a clicking noise when in use, so we stopped using it.Finally, I picked the heater up to move it, set it down on the carpet and the heater part of the unit broke free of the base (it looked like only glue was holding the heater to the base). I am contacting the company, I will update the status of their support after I contact them."
5,Best Book Ever,I love this book soooo much. I would love to see it as a movie!! I would recomend this book to anyone. It is enthralling
5,Should be feature film,"Visual writing with lots of adventure. All the detailed technical information was educational. The stakes were really high. It reminded me of a James Bond type of action adventure with exotic locations and heroes and villains made of pure evil. The diving scenes made me feel I was there under the sea. WB is great describing tense, life and death moments. It was a fun read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure and sophisticated stories with lots of moving parts."
4,William Beck!,"I bought this for my husband, but he had to go out of town on business unexpectedly. Since I was alone I decided to indulge in HAARPS FURY. Really good. Suspensful. It made for good company. Ladies you'll enjoy sharing this with ""hubby."" By the way, William Beck is cute too!"
2,Step backward from 10.5,"I regret spending the money for the ""upgrade"" from 10.5. PcA 11 no longer shows time remaining for file transfer, nor does it show transfer speed. It hangs, giving a ""Cannot create directory"" message for no discernable reason, where there was no problem with 10.5 If 11 has some advantages, I find nothing that does me any good. It has a different interface, but I don't see that as either better or worse. I'm going to remove it and go back to 10.5."
2,Clunky Upgrade,"There is a definite downturn with this new release- screen draws are noticeably slower and simply starting the application takes longer. The new interface has the task-based side bar found in newer applications, but it adds no benefit while robbing me of valuable screen space - the old toolbar at the top was much better. I applaud Symantec's fixing odd behaviors (non-invasive, such as strange 'quick' popups to handle internal routines, etc), and I appreciate their attempt at making the user experience more consistent and smooth, which they did, but the overall value of the product has dropped. For the core features I use (connect, control, end session) the performance has dropped- and I have no need for the new features. I'll be selling this on ebay... right after I go back to the odd but faster 10.5."
2,good product but TERRIBLE SUPPORT,"Hi,This is an excellent product but the support is terrible. I tried calling the company and was on hold for more than an hour but no one picked up. I've heard others have had similar problems.It's sad because this is a very good product. I'm considering gotmypc.com because I can't answers for how to get this thing thru a router set with one ip address.THE REAL PROBLEM ISN'T PCANYWHERE, IT'S SYMANTEC. If someone would make a good product and provide good tech support, they could put SYMANTEC out of business... I've had a similar experience when I sought help for NORTON ANTIVIRUS.Well that's all for now..."
2,Upgrade from 10.5 to 11.0 was BAD choice; no updates,"I am a systems integrator and have been supplying clients with PC Anywhere for several years for remotely monitoring chemical and industrial processes. This involves animated HMI software and it has always worked fine. When using ver.11.0.1, I have found that the animations will not automatically update when the host and remote are connected over a local network connection using fixed IP addresses. The same software works fine over a dial-up connection. I called their tech. support and received absolutely no satisfaction. I guess it's back to 10.5 till something better comes along."
4,"Kaleidoscope, A Carla McCarthy Adventure","Wow, this book was a page turner for me. It has many characters living interesting intricate lives. As the story unfolds I felt like I knew the people and wanted to find out what was going to happen next. Very enjoyable. I'm looking forward to Gretchen Stone's next book. I don't want to miss it."
4,Kaleidoscope is a fitting title,Great lesbian characters and lots of them - cast of participants provided helps remind. I enjoyed reading this mystery (and I don't usually read mysteries). The plot thickens gradually then is mostly resolved (good to save some unknowns for the next adventure to start from) quite quickly. If you grew up in the fifties and sixties you'll recognize some touchstones from that era. The resolution even includes a political slant.While I'm not a professional book reviewer I do read extensively and feel that this is a most enjoyable first book. I look forward to more.
5,Great recipes,A great book for the beginners and does have some really delicious meals with step by step directions. Great gift.
2,Lorenzo Parker's Review,"Finally, a Backyard Baseball game with the Washington Nationals. Here are some problems with the game:Pablo Sanchez speaking EnglishAchmed Khan's headphones are missing when he's pitching or during fielding view.Some kids that should'nt be smaller than Pablo Sanchez:Angela DelvecchioGretchen HasselhoffIchiro SuzukiAlfonso SorianoNomar GarciaparaHere's all the unlockable goodies:Abner DubbleplayBarry DeejaySammy SosaJim ThomeDontrelle WillisMike PiazaAquadomeHumongous Memorial StadiumQuantim FieldThe graphics are not that great."
4,Good patient education,"This is a nice book for patient education handouts. It's easiest if you tear out the papers and keep in a binder for quick copies. Although it doesn't have every topic I would like, it has a nice variety. We had an older version at work and I was glad to find a revised/updated book."
3,ok enough for FP,"I do peds more so a lot of the stuff in this book wasn't helpful for me. Ok reference to have around for some patients, but more adult stuff in here"
3,Vega 360 Telescope (GeoVision Precision Optics),"Fast, easy ordering, and received promptly, but Not what I was expecting. Defintely a childs toy. Unless we are doing something wrong you can see the craters on the moon better by eyesight than with telescope. Stars can be seen, but it takes a lot of effort. Nontheless, my child likes"
2,Very little Vega,"I bought the Vega as a ""first telescope"" for my 5 year old. I thought it would be fun to look at the moon and stars together. It was very difficult to find and focus on the moon with the scope. The view was very shaky and there was no hope of finding stars. We had a better view of the moon and stars with our naked eyes. The 3rd day we had it, the outer lens pushed back into the scope while my 9 year old neice was using it (I'm sure a great deal of credit for the mishap goes to her methods) and was irretrievable. Now, all objects are upside down and using the scope promotes motion sickness. I should have gone for a better built more expensive model that would have lasted longer."
1,Telescope,"Did not realize it was table top tripod, but that was my oversight, although I was looking for a free standing tripod. Terrible quality. More of a toy for little ones than a telescope to use for real stargazing. I returned it for a refund."
3,all right,I bought this for my 5yr old son and he loved it! The only down fall is that the magnification is not what I expected.....but it still works well.
3,"Ok, but not great","Not enough power for anything really interesting. You can get the same results from a good pair of binoculars and a lot easier. The tripod isn't very stable and limits how high up you can point the telescope, kind of tough since stars are UP in the sky. ;) It was ok to get the kids interested in looking up at the sky, but I want to get a better one so we can view planets and their moons. Wish I had spent my money on that in the first place."
5,An unbelievable program,"This program works unbelievably well. I use it in conjunction with the Park Enterprises Football Statistics program and they are an unbeatable combination. Both programs save a lot of time and work, and technical support is always available if needed."
3,Cute but for the INSIDE of the tub not the Outside,"I bought this thinking that it was a bath RUG for the outside of the bathtub (which I call a bath mat, hence my confusion). It's cute so I kept it and put it inside the bathtub even though my tub has built in non-slip. Though, that built-in texture keeps this mat from sticking well to the bottom. I imagine it would stick well on a slick bottom bathtub and accomplish its purpose. It's very cute though and my kids think it's fun."
1,Not very good,It doesn't stick to the tub. It looks nice that's about it. Instead of sitting on it my kids play with it. When u fill the tub with water it rises to the top of the water. Not to safe if u have little kids!!
5,Good book for Traffic Simulation Developer,This book give wide range of traffic flow fundamental. The context start from explaining the principle of traffic flow theory to explaining the application simulating the traffic flow in real world. The appropriate person for this book should has a background about statistic and claculus.
3,"Good book, bad quality!","It can be a good textbook for your study. However, the pages start to come off after two months of moderate usage! I understand that it is a paperback book but the spine should still hold up better. I certainly hope I just got a lime this time. But as far as I have experienced, the quality is clearly not as impressive as the contents. If you decide to keep the book and refer back frequently for a long time, I would suggest you buy a hardcover version. Service from Amazon is as good as usual."
3,There are better alternatives,"It works as an MP3 player and the actual hardware and software rendering of sound is spot on. But as a functional object, it's got flaws. The tiny storage capacity and quirky button layout will eventually frustrate you. It's easy to press the wrong button in your pocket, and then you have to pull it out to see what you did wrong.Spend a little more money and get something nicer, i.e. more functional."
4,"Great, for the price","I've only had this product for a few weeks, but after using it I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap but decent mp3 player. It comes with many features, just realize you get what you pay for. For example, it says it comes with play list support, but only for play lists shorter than 20 songs. Also, it tends to be quite laggy when cycling through your songs on the display. Others have complained about the short back light time, and although I have not verified it's operation, there is an option to increase the back light time greatly.The sound quality on this unit seems fine: I've been using the included headphones and I haven't noticed any huge distortions. In addition, this thing is way bigger than it appears in the pictures, but is comparable in size to other major mp3 players."
4,SanDisk SWDMX3-2048,"This is a very nice MP3 player for the price. Some nice options also: FM reciever, backlite, equalizer. Easy to use, it only took me about 15 minutes to open it up read the instructions and start copying music. I have around 15 CD's on mine and it's about 3/4 full. Batteries last a long time also. For the price I would highly reccomend. nice to use while exercising also(comes with arm band). I would have rated it 5 stars, but the backlite only stays on about 3 seconds. But over all a great buy!"
3,Inexpensive MP3 player,"Over all I like and still use the player daily for over 3 months. There is one problem with it, though but I think I just bought a defected one. Everytime a new/differnt battary gets bellow half(1/2) its lifespan the backlight won't turn on. I called SanDisc about 3 times(they said it wasn't 'normal'), and they were in the process of helping, 'try this and call us back' type, when I went on a month long trip. So long story short I got use to this little defect and haven't been thinking about returning (""You have a year long warranty, so if the problem persists you can return it anytime and we'll fix it... if not we'll send you a new one"" - SandDisc said) So, it is a good product and I would buy it again in a heart-beat but with a little more memory, but I guess there's never enough :DPS also the whole plastic cassing and buttons 'feel' cheap, and did anyone else experienced 'my' problem?"
2,Great but...,"This is a great little MP3 player especially if you want to be moving while using it. Unfortunaley, there is a known problem with the player that Sandisk has not been able to fix with new firmware. At random times the sound will emit a crackle and skip (remember what a scratch did to your LP playback?). Sandisk customer support tried to help, but finally advised me to return the player if I was not satisfied. I used it for Audible books. I've tried two of these and both had the problem. Luckily Amazon is most gracious with returns."
3,"Functional, a small issue if you listen to ebooks or podcasts","It's functional, and would be okay for listening to songs.If you listen to ebooks or long podcasts, it's a bit annoying as you can't move forward / backward"
3,Did not last,"Loved this product when I first received it - as did my friend - I bought each of us one. Easy to load, lots of memory, almost intuitive controls. However, it did not take very long for my friend's player to break down - in just a few months. He used it every day, but then that's to be expected for such equipment. He had to buy something to replace it. Mine is still going, but I use it infrequently. Did not feel good about paying so much for something that didn't last at least a couple of years."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought one of these for my son for Christmas and had a terrible experience with it. I opted for this one because I thought the battery was a better option for a kid than recharging. Within 20 days about half the screen was unreadable and garbled. I returned it for another one and that one too failed within 2 weeks when it became totally unresponsive. No matter what I did it simply would not boot and play. I finally just returned that one for a refund and bought him something different. If you can find this for 30 bucks or something it might be fine as a backup that you won't cry about losing or breaking, but as a primary mp3 player there are many better choices."
1,"Slow DL speeds, loose battery cover, cheap buttons","When downloading music to your M250 it takes forever. I previsouly had a creative Muvo MP3 player & the downloads was flawless. Also the battery door is loose & rattles. When you press the buttons, sometimes it takes 2-3 presses for it to register to move onto the next song. Very annoying. I wouldn't reccommend this product to anyone. My advice is to buy a Creative Brand MP3 player since they're close to the same price. Plus they rock. I just ordered a new Muvo m100 2GB MP3 player & should have it in a few days. This SanDisk is going on eBay."
4,SanDisk Sansa 2GB player,"Still getting used to the button format, but sound is very good. Holds true to capacity and is VERY small, but has search features lacking on Apple Shuffle. Price was way better than apple products, and while downloading music is a bit cumbersome (compared to iTunes) it is very easy to tote.Go for it!"
4,Good Buy,"I bought this as an alternative to the expensive ipods etc. I really love it. I made the decision to buy this specific one because it has a radio, while I love to listen to music on cds and such I like listening to the radio more. The radio doesn't get crystal clear sound, but it works well enough for me to use on a daily basis. I don't agree with people that this was complicated to use. I have now owned it for 9 months and it only took me a couple of hours to figure out everything on it. Just fish around and you too will figure it out. I think if you don't have hundreds of dollars to throw away this is a GREAT buy to substitute for the more expensive kinds. Buy rechargable batters!!"
5,Great Player,Awesome and easy to use. Plays well. Drag and drop function for adding music. The FM and recording features are great. Nice to be able to record your great thoughts when driving and come home and save them on your computer.
4,Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player,"This MP3 Player is much nicer than any MP3 player I have ever seen. It is very small, lightweight and easy to use. I also like that it uses only 1 AAA battery so I don't have to lug all of that battery charger stuff with me everywhere. The battery last a really long time too. The radio is a really cool function, but I don't use it much. My only complaint is that it is supposed to automatically recognize the artists of the songs I put on it, but it doesn't. My husband said that it isn't the fault of the MP3 player though, it is because I used real player to load the songs onto the player. We had to manually insert the name of every song and artist onto another music application to put them on the MP3 player. Other than that, it is really cheap for all of the functionality and coolness it provides."
3,Lack of instructions,"There seems to be a lack of instructions with this device. I did not actually use it myself but, my 16 yr. old who has more knowledge about these kind of things found it kind of difficult. We also had to return one due to a defect."
3,it's alright,it does its job really well as a music player but i personally didn't like the bulkiness of it. i like the apple's ipod style a lot more. this uses AAA batteries which makes it at least as big as the battery compared to the built-in battery of an ipod.
1,AAA Battery.,"Why, in this day and age, would I want to buy something that runs on a AAA battery when there are many a more user friendly Mp3 players on the market. Don't get me wrong, 2GBs of memory is quite good, it's just that why wouldn't Sandisk make a rechargable internal battery when all, ALL, of the other Mp3 players on the market have one.I've owned what you could call its sister device (a smaller 1GB device) that worked exeedingly well, it even had a rechargable battery. It works as well as the 1GB device, but the use of a AAA battery is what kills the potential for this device in my mind. There is no, absoloutly no excuse for the need for batteries in an Mp3 player."
1,I didn't recive this item,This is not delivered to specified location. But I got refunded the money that I spend on it.
2,won't fast forward,Nice and compact but for some reason I can't get it to fast forward to a section in an audio book where I left off without going back to the beginning of the chapture- very frustrating. Quick Start Guide and on line information gave no assistance. Wasn't able to read the start up disk on my XP system.
2,It would be Great if it only turned on,"From the moment I got it the m250 it had a hard time turning on. And as time went by, say 3 weeks it was extremely difficult to get the device to turn on. And there was about a week that I didn't even use the device bc I was waiting for my audiobook to come in the mail. When it came on I was thrilled with its ease of use and quality it provided, but I only expect it to get worse. If I use it then turn it off, I have to wait several hours to get it back on : / Very frustrating, but you get what you pay for."
1,Do not waste your time,"Do not waste your time and money on this MP3 player. I've spent more time trying to get the thing to play all the songs than I have listening to it. You cannot delete songs on the device--you have to do it on the computer--have fun with that one! This thing loves to duplicate and will not play all of the songs. I've had this since the beginning of August and it's already freezing up and it's gone through MANY batteries. $30 is too much to pay for this, much less the retail price! All I can say is, if you do buy this thing--good luck!"
3,san disk sansa 2GB m250 MP3 player,I would say this is just ok for the money.. I previously owned the ipod shuffle and thought this would be similar. I was wrong.. This is a totally different animal. You get what you pay for..The on/off and volume controls are difficult to manipulate. The ear plugs do not stay in my ears. Stick with ipod....
4,SanDisk Sansa m250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black) Review,"it was a bit bigger than i expected it to be , but otherwise its perfect."
4,very good family of players,"In regard to the specifics provided by other reviewers I have nothing to add. I would simply like to remind the potential purchasers that the AAA battery option that this product offers is fading quickly.... Best Buy has no AAA battery MP3 options (at my local store). Therefore, if you want freedom from the need to purchase a charger, or freedom from the need to find a computer with which to charge up a MP3 player with new battery technology (using the USB cable), this appears to be among the last of dying breed - the AAA battery powered MP3 player.I went to Europe a couple of years ago and was delighted to find that this product remained available. No need to track down a power source... No need to buy a converter that the battery charger accessory required for juice. I merely needed to track down AAA batteries (or, in my case I estimated that at 10 hours per battery, I took 5 AAA batteries for my trip).2 years later, still using my MP3 player."
3,not so fancy,"this is not exactly the fanciest mp3 player, nor does it have many functions, but it plays music well, it records, and it has radio. I think this is perfect for a person who just wants a cheap, pocket sised mp3 player just so that they can listen to music."
2,Unreliable,"Bought this to use while working out at the gym. The small size seemed convenient and my previous Sansa e140 worked well (still does). This one failed after only four months. Would not reset, my PC could not longer ""see"" it via USB port. Display said the storage memory (2 GB) was full even though I only had 1 GB of songs on it."
1,Quit working,"I liked the price and the simplicity of it (no need for iTunes or other software), but mine also quit working after about 6 months. It has a brand new battery and it just won't turn on. On the rare occasion it does turn on, it just stops after a few songs. I guess I'll try to spend a bit more on a higher quality product next time."
1,Junk,"I got what I paid for. I bought this because I don't care about special features, mega hardrives, or cool design but I do care that it actually works. I usually can get through the menu to choose a playlist one time. Then if I want to choose another playlist or even replay what I just heard I have to power down and start over again because the function keys freeze. Even the on/off switch doesn't work consistently as I frequently have to take the battery out to power down and start again."
2,Not much bang for the buck,your favorite list will empty when the unit is powered down. Unable to create a playlist or copy one from windows media player. It's basically an ipod shuffle with a drag and drop feature. The sound quality isn't bad.
5,Very Good,"This does everything I wanted it to do and fits easily into my pocket. It's a great campanion on my nightly walks, and it's loaded with over 35 hours of my favorite music. You can't do better than that, can you???"
3,"o.k, get newer model if possible",This was my first mp3. Its battery life is pretty good and you wont find yourself changing its batteries after a trip to the gym. i have the blue model but that doesnt change anything. the screen is a little dark and dull so no videos for you.if i were you i would keep searching for an mp3.
1,Would have been 4 or 5 stars last week!,"It worked great for about 2 years, but died on me last week. I did use it quite a bit without any complaints. I can not recommend it for long term durability, however."
4,SanDisk sansa m250 2G MP3 Player,This mp3 player works good and is farley simple to use. It just took too long to get to me from chi tech. By the time I got it I could have got it for cheaper at the store down the street. I don't remember the exact time it took to get to me but it was around 2 months. This is not expectable to me. Although Amazon kept me on top of matters the whole back order thing after you order is not the way to keep a customer.
1,Get what you pay for,"Got this player for my birthday last year but never used it till Nov. 2007. Six months later, serious problems. One day, nothing would sync to it. I had to go through all sorts of confusing computer stuff to get an automatic update thing. Now I can sync music, but my previous files are frozen there. I can play them, but I can't delete them, and they do not come up on my computer. I can't put playlists on like I used to (by dragging my WMP playlists into the sync window). WMP says the files were synced, but there is no playlist there.The first time I had problems, I researched a lot on-line, and this is a very common problem (not being able to clear out your music and the playlist confusion). The only recommendation I found was to buy a new one. I'm going to spend a little more this time and get something with quality.If you don't need to erase songs or don't use playlists, it should be fine for you!"
2,SD Sansa m250 MP3 player,"When it works, it works very well. However, I am on my third one; other two were replaced by SD; the display stopped functioning. The m250 is very easy to use and to transfer files; great battery life. Technical support is not real helpful since English is not their native language."
1,mp3 player,I would not recommend this product. The three I purchased for gifts have been replaced more than once and finally for a credit. We went elsewhere to purchase I did not want to take a chance on them being faulty again.
5,GREAT LITTLE UNIT,Great little unit for the money...I like the idea that it runs on 2 triple A's and not an internal battery which could run dead when you most need it.
2,Don't buy.,"I bought this product to use while jogging. It has been an excellent buy. My only complaint is that it does not receive AM stations (however, it does receive FM stations).I recommend this product for those people who want an inexpensive mp3 player, as an alternative to the ipods. For me, the Sansa has been a great workout companion. And unlike an ipod, this only cost me $25.Update (2011): I bought the product in 2008. Earlier this year (2011) it started turning off as a result of vibrations & shocks while jogging. Very frustrated. Product does not last long."
4,Sansa M250,"I pick this one up as a x-mas present for my nephew, I bought one for myself a year ago for twice amount the price I paid for this one. It's easy to operate and has many extra small features: a clear case to keep it in good condition, strips use during exercise. It also has more features than my more expense MP3 player: sleep timer, FM stereo, voice recording. For the price, it's a great buy."
3,Sansa m250,"I like the Sansa m250. The price was very good. The sound is good. I love the fact you can replace the battery yourself. I am disappointed that I cannot figure out how to have the audiobook I'm listening to start out where I left off. As soon as I figure out if/how to make the mp3 player do that, I will give it all five stars!"
5,Love this player!,"I love the shape of this mp3 player. It fits well in my hand so I can change music while I am driving and I'm not distracted. I use this while I do house work, garden, drive in the car, and while at work. I never have any problems with it. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries and always have back up ones charged. I've accidently left this player on in my car while I was at work and when I was driving home, there was plenty of battery life left, I thought it would have died. This is well worth the very low price, I only listen to music and this serves the purpose. Sound quality is great, I use sound blocking headphones that block out noise, so get great music quality. I've dropped it many times and it doesn't have a scratch on it. It would be great for kids too, the screen is easy to see and lights up well. The menu is very easy to navigate. I highly recommend this mp3 player. I like it much better than the Sansa Clip and it's cheaper."
1,Been through 3 already!!,We bought 2 of these for our daughters for Christmas a couple of years ago. Shortly after the warranty expired one of them froze on the boot up screen never the function again. Customer Service said it was fried and there was nothing they could do. Felt bad and bought our daughter a new one. About 9 months later the exact same thing happened to the other original player. We're obviously NOT replacing it with another. Just waiting for the one we bought about a year ago to fry up!
4,Great MP3 player!,"This is a really great mp3 player, I have not figured out how to do the play list yet, and I did not like the ear buds that came with it, so I got my own, but it is easy to manage and I like that I can turn it off and when I turn it back on it's right where I left off."
3,Power button problems,I have a 1GB version of this product and I have never had a problem. I recently purchased the 2GB version and have had significant problems with the power switch. You have to hold it down in just the right spot or it won't go on. Sometimes it totally refuses so I have learned to pull the battery and put it back in and retry and it then works. Otherwise great mp3 player for small amount of money.
2,very weird thing. poor software. stupid,"1) Can't build a play list2) the ""favortie song"" list gets deleted every time you upload new songs3) Some of my songs just disappeared into the mp3 player. they are still in it, but I cannot find them in the file when I connect the sandisk to my computer. So, these songs are stuck in my sandisk forever... I'm tired of them.4) poor navigation. it's slow, and the screen is too dark. Not safe to navigate while driving.5) too bulky. Not good for working out with it.I just wanted something that worked. It worked, but... I wish I had saved the money for something better"
3,problem with deadlocks,The price is great for a 2GB player. I bought this to replace my old 512 MB Sandisk player that I had lost. I thought it would work just the same only with more memory. I like that all the features are the same as my old one and that is has a lot more memory but there are a few problems that I have that I didn't have with the old one. The biggest problem is that it frequently deadlocks or freezes up. It will be stuck and none of the buttons can fix it. I have to take the battery out and put it back in to get it going again. This is very especially annoying if you use the clear plastic cover like I do. Other problems are that it is much slower and I think the radio reception is not as good.
1,Just Okay,"I bought this MP3 player within the last 3 weeks. It was great the first week, I enjoyed the fact it wasn't too big or bulky, and was easy to use. However, after that first week I noticed it often would not power up when I tried to turn it on. And now it has begun to shut itself off at random. I never used it excessively, less than an hour at a time, not every day certainly. No idea why it has suddenly gone bad."
2,Not as reliable as my old m230,"I had a Sansa m230 up until recently. The thing was great, exactly what I wanted in an MP3 player - long battery life, drag & drop music loading, and quality playback. I had it for three years or so, then I dropped it one too many times and the display stopped working. I decided that since the m230 was so great and since the m250 had all the same features, more capacity, and was now less than what I paid for the m230 when I got it, getting an m250 was a no brainer.I'm sorry to say that this product is just not good. Even with the latest firmware, it locks up regularly, the randomizer plays the same song multiple times in a row, and the sound quality is worse than the m230s was. This player is a textbook case for a product taking a serious step backwards.So if you can find an m230 and don't need a lot of capacity, I could not recommend that player more. As for the m250, I have to advise you to stay away."
1,Dislike!,"We purchased two of these to be used during workouts. Because of its shape, the device flops around on my arm when used with the armband - I usually end up taking it off because it becomes such an annoyance. The battery life is incredibly short. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Sansa m250,"I got this player and made the mistake of not using it for a while....when I did, it died in less than a month. .....I'm very dissapointed."
2,Product NOT identified as USED / REFURBISHED in Sales Listing,"I have had issues with this purchase as it was received out of the packaging and has been identified as refurbished on the item itself. The seller failed to note anywhere in the sales listing that this item was USED & REFURBISHED. If I had known it was USED/REFURBISHED, I could have purchased the same item from a seller who openly was offering the item as used.This is the first time using Amazon that I've been burnt by a seller. I will know better next time - if the price is too good, then something is probably wrong."
4,Works very well either with manually loading or through a program,"It works well with Windows Meida Player or to just drag-and-drop files. The categorization meets my needs. This is for someone with limited technology skills and it works well.I would, however, prefer a unti without radio or recording capabilites (or the ability to turn these features off) since they are not needed and add (only slightly) to the complexity of operation."
1,Good luck if you buy this!,Froze up after about 3 weeks of use. Sandisk technical support was certainly not very helpful. Luckily I was able to return this thing to Amazon. They just do not make MP3 players like they used to. I will not be buying any more Sandisk MP3 players; good luck to you who do!
1,Don't buy it!,"I purchased two M250's for my children. Both kids commented on how cumbersome the operating software was but appreciated having a reasonable-priced MP3 player-- until *both* units failed within six months of purchase! We contacted Sansa customer support when the first one died, and they informed us that they would send a replacement out as it was under warranty. SIX WEEKS after Sansa acknowledged receiving the defective unit, they claimed that the RMA authorization had lapsed (we sent the unit in promptly). Caveat emptor-- if this unit seems inexpensive, it's because it is flimsy and badly supported. Buy an Ipod or *anything* other than a Sansa. My three year old Rio S35 has been a more reliable performer than these M250's. Run, don't walk, from these units, if our experience with their reliability or customer support is any indication."
2,Decent when it works,"Bought this player on June 23, 2006. For five months, it worked fine. It's small and easy to use. Very nice player. But, then, without any reason, it stopped working. (BTW, it works fine as usb drive.) Now, I'm starting the warranty process. So far, the SanDisk people have been helpful. Hopefully, this will continue. Keep copies of your order. You might need it."
2,Poor Quality,"I have owned three SanDisk Sansa M240 models that store 1GB. The first one I purchased with a in store warranty, but the player did not work right out of the box. So I took It back and got a second Sansa which developed an intermittent short within two months causing sound quality to diminish significantly. I took the second Sansa back and cashed in my warranty on a third SanDisk Sansa m240 1GB along with buying a second in store warranty. In two months my third SanDisk Sansa m240 developed the same intermittent short. I'll cash in my warranty on a different player this time."
2,Backlight Limitation,"The music sounds great on this model, but the backlight will stopped lighting up if the battery is half used. Music still play but the backlight don't lit up anymore unless new battery is installed. This makes it impossible to search for songs or navigate through menus in the dark. I contacted Sandisk and they confirmed this limitation on the m200 models, but they don't disclose this info anywhere."
4,Could be better...,"Pros:-- Inexpensive. High GB/$.-- Lightweight-- Runs on AAA (I personally prefer alkalines because I can replace them unlike the built-in rechargables. Also, rechargable alkalines are cheap)-- Comes with nice arm band and a cover. (Cover is thin though)-- Bright displayCons:-- User interface sucks. It takes some time to figure out what is where.-- Good luck if you want to create playlists. See other reviews for the same problem.-- Very small display.The things that I can live with but I wish it...-- had a better sound quality. It is not bad but there is room for improvement-- were smaller. Kinda bulky. Buttons are unnecessarily big and display is small.-- had a color display."
5,LOVE THIS PLAYER!!!!!,"It is very small and so easy to work and download. I am 63 years old and I am so new to this. But, this player sounds great and do not be afraid of the AAA battery power. I use mine everyday for a couple of hours and the battery lasts 2 months or more. I am glad I got one like this that does not have to be charged all the time. This is a great player for the money, it is my ""buddy"" for life"
2,Player not reliable,"I purchased this just before the new year. It has been working until now, the second week of March. Although, even when it was working I could not get it to create playlists but at least it would play the music I put on the thing. Now all of a sudden the display screen comes up when I turn the unit on and I am not able to access any of the menus. Its frozen. I tried to exchange it through Amazon but the return center would not allow me to.I called SanDisk and they tried troubleshooting the problem. It turns out the thing is broken. They created a shipping label for me and I am returning it to SanDisk for a replacement. It sounds like this could have been avoided if I had downloaded their firmware updater on the SanDisk website. Whatever bug the unit has could have been fixed but now its too late. At least I will be getting a new one but I am not happy with Amazon for ignoring my request."
4,2 GIG MP3,This item is just what I was looking for. I walk/jog every morning. The cold temperatures/humidity/ and movement was killing higher priced MP3 players. I was able to put 600 songs on this little tough guy and it's been performing well. I advise using a lithium battery to take the annoyance out of killing regular triple A's.
2,"Bought two, had to return one","So far one of the two I bought had to be returned for a faulty LED and backlight. Sandisk paid for return shipping (UPS) and sent me a totally new one 10 days later, which seems ok so far (1 day of testing). I think they let customers do the QA testing after purchase, frankly. Cheap, but you pay for it in other ways."
4,Good product,"I'm satisfied with it, it does everything the specifications say. It was also cheap and now I've found it to be reliable too, I've had it for 3 months with no problems. The only detail I'd mention is that depending on the Windows version you use you can't retrieve the files from one PC in another one; for example you'll be able to upload the files at home but you might not be able to download them at work... of course if the Windows versions are the same you can do it in any PC. Other than that little thing I'd recommend this product to anyone."
1,"""corrupted""","I've had this for a month or so, and it continually becomes what the Sandisc tech calls ""corrupted."" It plays through my library of books on tape and then refuses to play them again until I reformat it. And reload my Audible library. So far, no satisfaction from the manufacturer."
5,MP3,Bought for young children. Great for the money. Easy for children to add and delete selections. The perfect starter MP3.
4,Good value MP3 Player,The Sansa M250 is an excellent value MP3 player. It is easy to use and update. It actually stored many more songs than I thought it would.
4,nice little player,"This player is easy to use and sounds great.... It does move a bit slow for my taste from song to song but its small form factor and fm tuner make it very convenient. Batteries last a long time in it. When you first connect it to your PC, it's setup to use some software that comes with it to transfer songs (rather than acting like a hard drive you can simply copy files to). There is an option in the setup that allows you to make it appear as a hard drive so you can copy over files - that makes things a lot easier. The earbuds included with it are so-so - Other earbuds reallyt make this product shine."
4,MP3 Player,"I didn't want to but a player with all kinds of bells and whistles. A friend recommended this player. The reviews I read were all the way from 1-5 stars - mostly in the higher ratings. I took a chance and purchased one and have been quite pleased. I download my music from Microsoft Media in WAM format and can get about 950 songs on the player. It also has an FM receiver that I haven't tried.The user manual is easy to follow, the player is easy to navigate and the sound quality is very satisfactory. It uses one AAA battery, so I don't have to deal with recharging when I'm backpacking, skiing, etc. A battery lasts 15-19 hours.I gave it a 4 rating because is doesn't have a lot of extras which some might want, but for the price it is a great little player."
2,Unhappy,When I first got this product it worked as advertised. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but with electronics of this kind one gets what one pays for.roughly four months after purchase the item just stopped working. After looking on several websites and attempting to contact their customer service several times I found no real assistance.From what I was able to gather this is a known issue with the product and there is no known way to fix it as yet.I moved on to a different style although from the same company.
1,2ND ONE - BOTH FROZE ON MAIN SCREEN - DON'T BUY,"I really liked the first one I bought, but after 6mo it died. It would only work with a USB plugged into my car radio. Would not work w/ headphones. Wouldn't even play. Blue screen wouldn't even come on. I thought it was a fluke....bought another...same prob after 4mo.Spend more or buy a different product!"
1,Piece of Junk!,This product stopped initializing after using it twice. The logo comes on and that is it. I have tried everything I have found on the internet and the sansa website. It is a well known problem without an answer. DON'T BUY THIS!
4,mp3 player,"I really enjoy this mp3 player. I like the fact that it has a radio. I was wondering though how many songs can be downloaded on it?Thank you,Michelle"
1,a fool and his money are soon parted,"carefully matched product and San-disk product manual, what a waste of time. IF the manual is correct I bought trash. I wanted ALL THREE functions (music box, FM radio and voice recorder/playback to function. I can get music files to play but they are not categorized in any manner, as described in the manual. The FM radio functions lack presets as described in the manual. The recorder does record BUT cannot play back AND files cannot be deleted as described in the manual. Also according to San-Disk website said I was shorted some items. see title for briefer review!"
1,Not for people who don't like to use Napster or Rhapsody,"I just ordered this thing a couple of months ago because I wanted a new mp3 player to listen to my music after I thought my original one couldn't upload music anymore. Once I got it in the mail, I opened it so I can try it out; but when I tried to upload any songs with it using Windows Media Player, it wouldn't allow me to. I tried to figure out what was wrong, and I saw why: you can only upload music using music-sharing websites such as Napster or Rhapsody. I tried to register for either website, only to find out I needed a credit card to purchase any songs to download (which I don't have one). I felt like I wasted thirty bucks buying something that I consider useless."
3,You get what you pay for,"Cheap. In all meanings, good and bad. Very very simple to load and use. No special software required. However, I could only about 0.5 gig of songs in my player, not the 2.0GB as advertised. It's cheap enough at $25 or so to be a good 512MB mp3 player, because that's what mine is."
1,sandisk mp3 player locks up,I started uploading music to my 2gb sandisk mp3 player using Windows Media Player and all went well until I added music files using Real Player. This unit promptly went blank. For all practical purposes it might as well be a brick. It will not turn on and my computer [and others] fail to acknowledge that the player is attached to them. Tech support keeps telling me to format [etc] the player. This help has been useless since computers will not attach to it.
1,Totally disappointing!!!,"I barely had this mp3 player for 24 hrs before it went bad, it shut off permenantly. First, I thought it was just the cheap battery that came along with the product so i went out and bought new ones but it didn't make a difference. Within 24 hrs the buttons malfunctioned completely, then it just shut off. It didn't even show signs of turning back on!!! I was very disappointed with this product. It's not worth what I paid for it at the time, 69.99"
1,Sansa M250 Review,"I am not very happy with this purchase at all. It continues to freeze up on a weekly basis. I am tired of having to format it. Then re-add songs again and again. Maybe it is just mine, but I would look another direction before buy this."
2,no full refund,"Directions hard to follow. Was not compatable with Windows 2000 and was not stated on the player or in write up on. As of now have not received full refund on my credit card and have sent in for review. Should get full refund, was less than 30 days and was not compatable therefore useless to me. Wanted it for flight to Alaska. SanDisk Sansa 250 mp3 player"
4,Great value.,Good for the price. Fits just enough songs to get thru a few days at work. I like that it is lightweight and I can carry it in my pocket.
3,My first MP3 player,The Sansa M250 is my first MP3 Player. The Sansa does exactly what I expected it to do. I have not been disappointed and nothing has given me an overwhelming sense of awe. It is very easy to use. One thing I don't like: the player does not do sound recording if the battery is half dead.
2,Very Cheap & Poor Sound Quality,"I bought this MP3 player because my iPod broke and I did not feel like spending $250 right away to get a new one. All I wanted to use this SanDisk for was working out at the gym, and listening to some music before sleep.This product works fine at high volume in the gym setting, but the equalizer is crap. I use a nice pair of skullcandy headphones, and the music sounds like it is coming out of an extremely old set of speakers.At low volume, there is this very irritating buzz that interferes with the music, probably because the MP3 decoder that the device uses is crap.Bottom line - The product sucks if you are used to listening to high quality MP3's above 128kbits. All of my music is at 256K or higher, and it just sounds like crap. I only use this device in the gym where I play it very loud, which drowns out the annoying buzz that you typically hear at low volume. You get what you pay for with this device."
1,Do not buy this product!,"I bought this mp3 player. After I downloaded the music, I realized this song downloaded wrong. I went to delete it, and I could not delete the song. After a few minutes of trying to delete it, all the songs, but one, were erased from my mp3 player."
1,WHAT IS THIS? REALLY!!!,I RECEIVED THIS SO CALLED MP3 PLAYER TODAY. IT LOOKS AND OPERATES LIKE A CHEAP PLASTIC TRANSISTOR RADIO FROM CHINA. THERE IS NO WAY THEY SOLD THIS THING FOR $140.00 WHEN IT WAS NEW. $29.00+MAILING COST WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY. DISAPPOINTED IN TEXAS
4,Happy,Great product. Very happy and I would recommend it. The only thing I would change is the design shape and the fact that the battery has to be changed every 2 days if used constantly. Worth the Money !!
2,My old 512MB was better in some ways,"While I enjoy the increased memory for more music and the recognition of more file types, I miss the old buttons I had on my 512. Buttons simply offer more tactile feedback than the membrane areas (I guess that's what they're called) on my newer m250. Sometimes these membrane areas don't respond and the A-B function I bought this unit for?; fugget about it! It's very difficult to isolate small segments of music with the new membranes. This is very important for me to learn a piece of music by ear. If I had known about these drawbacks prior to buying this 'new and improved' model I never would have bought it."
2,"Be careful that ""new"" isn't ""refurbished"" and faulty.","The SanDisk MP3 player was good sized, but didn't have audio function. A tech competent person tried it and pronounced it faulty. I spent $58 and the Amazon seller gave back $38. What the seller hadn't listed was that the player was a returned item and not new. Be careful about whether an item is used or new."
3,good product - good price,"With my other 2 Sansas, the 4gb models, I was able to copy and paste music to the device. For some reason this one wouldn't allow that and I had to go thru Windows Media Player and it took me a little bit longer. Still, for the price, it's hard to beat. It's the 3rd one I've bought. The other two were an arm and a leg. This one the 2gb model, was a steal. The price keeps coming down. I like this model of Sansa because it uses one AAA Battery and when it gives out, I can slip in another. The rechargeable ones always quit when I can't recharge conveniently. That is why I only buy this kind now. It's worth it to have one just a little bit thicker but always there when I need it to work."
2,poor at bitrates > 256 K,"I've owned this Sanza for around a year now and I think I have discovered the problem. I purchase most of my music from Amazon and I've noticed that some tracks sound good and others bad. When it's bad you can hear skips or artifacts that I don't hear when played directly on my laptop. Then I discovered that when you press the round center button to get information on the track, if the reported bit rate is greater than about 256K these are the tracks that have problems. I suspect the decoder hardware in the m250 just can not support the throughput of MP3 greater that 256K continuously, so the skips are portions that can not be decoded in real time, and distortion is heard. I'm hoping newer offerings have better, faster hardware that will decode reliably at high bit rates."
5,Happy User,"I'm very pleased with my purchase. It works plenty well for me. Some people complained about the sound quality, but I can't tell any problem. I just wanted a reasonably priced mp3 player that worked. I am very satisfied with what I got."
5,Great MP3 Player!!,"My family and I absolutely love this player. My parents, brothers, my wife and I all have one. We use them at work, home, and for our annual Backpacking trip into the high country. They are small, durable, and have a lot of functions. They hold about 450-500 songs(depending on song length), have FM radio, equalizer, and voice recorder. You can choose to play songs by artist, album, genre, year, and more. I have friends that have the IPODS and Zunes, and they like mine better because they have less functions and cost a lot more than the Sansa. Highly Recommend this player!"
5,AAA Power!,"For the price and the ease of downloading from my music libary, this is A GREAT BUY. Now,let's see if it holds up. After the hurricane hit, I was the only one that still has power to hear my music. Keep those AAA powered units on the market!!!!"
3,OK for the $,"Sync & drag & drop was easy, otherwise have to have a kid show me how to use it. Forget the FM band--it only picks up 1 station and this is in the Chicago area."
3,No pause with audio books,"Our family had 2 of the 512 version and had no problems. I received the m250 has a Christmas gift, mainly to listen to audio books. Unfortunately, this version does not work well with audio books. Each section I download is approximately 1 hour long. If I pause the book anytime after about 15 minutes of listening, when I hit resume, it will return to the beginning. This is obviously a bug the company does not plan to fix. The bar at the bottom shows the book is at the time I paused, however, what I hear is from the start. I rarely am able to listen for over an hour at a time without interruption so this player is not useful for me.I found probably a dozen comments on the Sansa community site, that lead me to believe SanDisk will not be fixing this error."
1,Very bad quality control,"Of the two Sansa players I have purchased, both have arrived inoperative in different ways: One would not load music (MP3 or WMA), while the other would simply not turn on. I would look elsewhere for a music player."
1,"DONT BUY THIS ITEM, IT BREAKS IN THE SAME PLACE","I purchased 3 for me and my kids, they break where the headphone plugs in, the 3 I purchased broke in the same place, I exchanged them for another 3 and they broke again, its a waste of money, 1 Star evaluation is to much, the sound is good while it works"
3,"Good for Music, Not so good for Audible","My primary objective in getting another good MP3 player (my RIO bit the dust out of warranty and out of business) was to download Audible books. Second, I wanted an MP3 player with enough capacity for the books plus a few hours of music. The Sansa M250 met these objectives for much less than I would have had to pay for an iPod. The big frustration I have with it is that it jumps forward at least 2 minutes every time I stop playing an audio book. If SanDisk could fix this, I'd gladly change my rating to 5 stars.It would also be nice if Audible had a better list of compatible players!! Currently, SanDisk is really the only viable choice short of an iPod and I just can't bring myself to spend that much money for an MP3 player."
5,YES you can create and use PLAYLISTS from Windows Media Player!!,"WMP will sync only the songs if you sync MANUALLY, but if you use WMP's AUTOMATIC syncing, then the playlists themselves (as well as the songs) get put onto the device (note that WMP still doesn't SHOW that the playlists are on the device, but they are definitely there and can be used)."
1,the second one just died--i'd give it a zero if i could,"I am returning the second player in two months, both played for a week or so then died. I am not getting another one.i got this for my daughter for Christmas, thinking ""why buy an $$$ Ipod"" for a kid in middle school who might easily misplace it or have it stolen? The reviews of the 1 gig were great. 2gig sounded better.Within a month it stopped working. The screen was an unreadable smear. Amazon promptly took it back, sent a new one. daughter was slow to reload it (disgusted with previous failure) two weeks later it wont start. checked the battery, its still good.we are done with this. Customer service may be great but having it fail and having to return the dang thing (and deal with angst about ""what did i do to it?"" answer: nothing. Other reviews note how durable it is. Well, not for us."
3,Could be better,"I'm happy enough with it's playing but I'm giving this 3 stars based on it's lack of documentation. No where do I see that you have to change the 'advance' setting to ""on"" in order for the playlist to function. No where does it say the playlist you create will disapear everytime you connect the device to the computer, whether you sync or not. I shouldn't have to search this information out on the internet and even requested a replacement from Amazon when I thought my device was not functioning correctly."
1,"Great unit, gone bad","I bought one of these for myself in September. It is still fantastic. However, I bought one for my son in early January. The power button broke. So, we RMA'ed the unit and got a replacement. The replacement is now frozen. Working with SanDisk to troubleshoot it, but it looks like it's going back as well!What happened? This was such a great player. Guess SanDisk is having quality issues."
1,Very Low-Quality MP3 Player,"I bought the Sandisk Sansa m250 2GB from [...], and I was initially very pleased with the player. I liked the small size of the player, and I found it to be a very handy little contraption. However, after 3 or 4 days of receiving the player, it stopped recognizing music, and it began to leave out letters on the titles of songs and albums (for example, Blue Oyster Cult would be displayed as Bl Os C, and Billie Jean would be displayed as Bil Jn) and it eventually froze on the opening screen and completely stopped working. I called Sandisk's customer support and was told of a method to use for resetting the Sandisk, which did NOT work. Please, don't waste your money on this MP3 player. I found it to be extremely poor quality and overall a waste of money."
1,Unhappy SanDisk Customer,This is the 2nd. SanDisk product I've purchased and have had the same problem with and had to return for credit. With both of these products they froze up after very little use: the first one 1GB froze up after 2 days use and the 2GB froze up after being used for about 2 weeks.
2,Off to a Rocky Start,"The player works pretty much as advertised, but the lack of documentation in the package was staggering.Such instructions as there are assume that you are ripping CDs into a Windows Media library - and then synchronizing the Sansa device from that program (2 weeks ago I would not even have understood the previous sentence).My musical relationship is with RHAPSODY - and so getting the M250 to work with that web site was pretty much a matter of trial and error.But - 4 days from the time that the M250 arrived on my doorstep - I had my music loaded.You pay more for the NANO - but loading music from iTunes has to be easier than my experience.My last concern focuses on the number of songs which the product packaging says this device will hold. Using WMA compression, Sansa claims up to 960 songs.I guess that's 960 songs, with each song lasting about a minute. Loading normal, progressive-rock-type material I am carrying a little over 300 tunes."
4,Good Value,"My daughter has the 1GB version of this and at age 9 could easily figure out how to use it. When I decided I needed to join the 21st century and get an mp3 player for myself. I did a little research and decided the 2GB version would be good for me. I find it quite easy to use and it sounds good. However, after 6 months, the volume control (down) broke. Since there is a 1 year warranty, I've contacted SanDisk and am waiting to hear back. I expect it will be repaired or replaced. My daughter has had hers nearly a year and has not had any trouble."
1,nice while it lasted,I definitely enjoyed this mp3 player... for the whole 27 days it lasted. After that it would freeze up on one of the opening screens. Luckily this happened in less than 30 days and I was able to return it. I've had good luck with sandisk memory cards... but I obviously don't recommend this product.
2,jury still deliberating,I received the item in October 2006 in a very timely manner and it worked great for 2 months. It could be I just ended up with the one bad one - but it stopped working for no apparant reason. I did receive GREAT customer service form SANDISK however as they promptly replaced my sandisk and even paid for the shipping to and from. So I just got my new device and and I'll have to see if it works longer than 2 months before I can make my final judgement.
5,Great Product,This is one of the best MP3 players that I have seen. Its good on battery life and everything. You can listein for hours and hours just off of 1 AAA battery.
4,Great player for a good price,"Good sound. Easy to load songs into it. Long battery life. It takes only one AAA battery and you can even use rechargeables. I rated it down for only one reason. Making playlists on this unit is very, very tricky."
5,Good product,"The Sansa M250 is perfect for my current needs. I needed a small, portable MP3 player to carry on my cleaning jobs. It fit the bill. Also, it's extremely easy to sync using Windows Media Player, and does not require a lot of extra space on my computer for programs to work with it. I am very satisfied with this product."
4,SanDisk SDMX3-2048 Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 Player,"Good product, good service. i didn't realize this was re-manufactured but maybe i just didn't fully read the ad. It's good..."
1,A Waste Of Money,After reading all the good reviews for this unit I was quite surprised to see it malfunction so badly. I loaded music on it with no problem. After listening to some songs I stopped it. When I turned it back on it won't do anything but say it's name. If I hook it up to the computer it says the tracks are still there. When I disconnect it from the computer it says that it is rebuilding the library. It continues to say that for a long time unless I turn it off. Removing the battery didn't help. The manual is a joke.The really bad part is that it worked so well at first that I ordered a second one. Before the second one got here the first one went bad. The second one didn't last as long as the first. There is no way I will buy another one. Only time will tell if I can get my money back.
3,A Nice Player But With a Serious Deficiency,This player does not support bookmarking of audio books except those purchased through Audible. This means that this player is not suitable for listening to many audio books.
5,"SANDISK SANSA M250 MP3 PLAYER, A GREAT LITTLE PLAYER..","This player was purchased as a Christmas gift, for a family member. I also have one and other similar SANDISK players.If you are looking for a straight forward player (no video, photos - etc) that just works properly and doesn't take rocket science to operate - this might be the one for you.It plays (MP3) music - very well, uses disposable AAA battery instead of expensive (to replace) Li-Ion and won't cost you a kidney to obtain.A SMART LITTLE PURCHASE!!!"
3,SanDisk Sansa m250 2 GB MP3 Player (Black),"The product performs as advertised. It is easy to use and simple to figure out, despite the fact it comes with virtually no instructions. The only down side I have seen is regarding battery life. It is an energy hog and I find I don't get close to the advertised 19 hours of battery life. Six to 8 hours would be more like it. In retrospect, I wish I had spent a little more and gotten a unit with a rechargeable battery."
5,Best Value MP3 player out there,As I said this has to be the best value for a 2gig MP3 player.Easy to use and download to using windows media player.Sound s great even with the smallish earbuds that it comes with.So easy to use I even got a second one for my wife.
1,Very Poor Product,"The software on this player is terrible. It locks up the player about every two or three months. I used to be able to go to SanDisk's website and download a fix, but now this player is not listed on the website. Do not expect to be able to use this player for very long. If you do buy it, format the disk, i.e., erase everything, once a month."
3,Average device,"I have two complaints. First, after synchronizing with Windows Media Player and disconnecting from the computer it says it is rebuilding its library. Once it is done the new files are not showning up in the library. After plugging it back in I view the files on the device through Windows Media Player and it shows the new files there. I have had to remove all the files and upload everything again.I have an Ipod but I bought this device so I could download and listen to audiobooks from my local library. The downloaded audiobook is just one huge file. My second complaint is the device can only play that file from the beginning. If I stop the playback, which I have to do because I am not going to listen to a 10 hour+ audiobook in one sitting, then I can't continue from where I left off. I have to start over.I do like this device for basic music and audiobooks from CD. I have even used the FM radio and found it acceptable."
2,"Great little device, but no fast forward","I was so excited to get this device for audio books. I was very disappointed when I started a book and found that if I stopped mid-chapter, I could not get back to my place. It's a big problem when the ""chapter"" is an hour long and I've listened to 40 minutes of it! I either have to start over, skip the last 20 minutes, or let it run and set a timer to pick it up at the right spot. Not very convienent. Great sound, easy to load with music...would be fantastic if I only wanted to listen to music!"
1,Biggest piece of junk you could buy!!,"This player worked GREAT!!.. at first! I'd seen some reviews about this player stating that it just stopped working, but bought one anyways thinking that mine would somehow be different. Three weeks later it randomly just began freezing when I turned the player on... Luckily it was still within Amazon's return time limit, so I had it replaced.. BIG MISTAKE.. i should have gotten a refund!! Four months later (Way out of the return time frame), my ""new"" player began to do the same thing!! For the last month and a half I tried emailing Sansa's ""customer service"" email address, and haven't gotten a single response. This is the worst thing you could spend your money on!! Other people give it great ratings, but that's because they haven't had it long enough for it to break down on them!! Now I've spent 70 bucks and have nothing to show for it... Take my advice and get something else!!"
1,recall needed,got 2 for christmas both froze on the start screen....got sent a replacement...froze on the start screen agian...now trying to get my money back and it's taking forever.....do not get this......
4,So Tiny!,"And that's a good thing. It's light, and easy to work. I received it a few days ago, and am still figuring out certain functions. I was sent a free 31-day trial of Rhapsody muscic service with it, and so far I'm having a great time with it.I wish the back light stayed on longer, or that there was a button I could push to make it go on, but those are the only improvements I'd make on it.WMA files are smaller than Jpg, so I can get 900+ songs on it. I've also downloaded two books on it already, and still have a GB of space left.Forget the overpriced Ipod with proprietary software. I got this out of the box and had synced music to it within 15 minutes. Hurray!"
1,Wonderful player... IF it worked,"I LOVED this little player... so much that I tried three times to get one that would work for more than three weeks. They freeze on the start up screen, and there is NOTHING you can do to fix it. I enjoyed this player because it held roughly 500 songs, used one triple A battery, and was very easy to operate. Wonderful, lightweight, compact, and good sound... that being said, it could clean my house and balance my checkbook, but if it doesn't work it is essentially useless.Keep your packaging and receipt... and enjoy... cautiously.I had a friend who had to send hers back twice."
2,What a disappointment,"For the first few weeks, it worked just perfectly. No problems at all. IThen out of nowhere I'm trying to play a song and the nothing is happening. I go to switch the song and all the artists and songs are listed as ""Mechanix"". Sometimes it'll freeze up completely or I'll get an error.Also, as I put music in, I'll get a message that the device is not responding. Once it does that (even once), it scrambles just about every song around into the wrong place. One song can be in 7 different places while others can't be found at all. I try overwriting the files, and that doesn't help. I'll delete everything and start all over, only to be denied.Now, to take the cake, it has gone from a 2 GB player, to a 700something MB player. Over a GB of memory has disappeared. I had no problems with the 512MB. Perhaps I'll have to go to another company for a player."
2,great for music,"This is a super MP3 if all you want to do is listen to music. It is easy to operate, sounds good and is inexpensive. Unfortunately, I wanted to listen to recorded books and there is no bookmarking feature. If you want to hear the first part of the story many times without getting to the end this is your player. If you want to hear the whole story at different sessions buy something else. The sales literature on most MP3 players does not list bookmark capabilities for their players--too bad."
1,Returned MP3 Player,I can't properly review this item because the sanDisk MP3 player was not compatible with my iBook G4 so I had to return it.
3,Fast Forward and CD Issues,"I really like this little guy, but I'm disappointed with the CD that came with it. Even when I tried it on my old dependable XP and new Vista machines, nothing happened when I clicked the main start icon. The player isn't hard to figure out though, and it has a great display. It's a compact size but not so tiny that I'll lose it. My only other beef with the player is the fast forward function. I bought this mainly for audiobooks, and when I fast forward, it seems to want to skip to the next book part as soon as it hits around 18 minutes into the section. No matter if I try holding the button down for a sustained period or just for five seconds or so. Maybe if the CD worked I could resolve this issue. Hmmm."
2,Problematic,I've had mym250 for one year. Today it just died. It powers up to the initial Sansa screen and then freezes. Nothing I do fixes it.Over the past year I have found this to be a tempermental product. It is not reliable.My next mp3 player will be an ipod. My daughter has had a nano for 2 years and has much better luck with it.
1,Poor Performance of M250,"I bought this for my 10 year old and it worked for about 3-4 days. Then at startup it froze after the welcome screen. Reset did nothing. Returned it to Amazon and received a 2nd one in less than a week, which was commendable service from Amazon. Same thing happended to the second player. Returned it and bought an Ipod. No issues so far after two months. I would not recommend the M250 MP3 player."
1,Defective and should be recalled!,"This product ceased to function after 1 month of use! After searching the internet I find that this is very common and there is no way to fix it (there is not even a RESET button). Do not buy this product because it is defective. However, SanDisk agreed to replace it and Amazon agreed to give a refund."
1,wait some time before evaluate any electronic device,"I bought a SanDisk Sansa M230 512 MB MP3 Player Blue from Amazon on about one year ago and used almost 20 times. When I recently tried to use it, it was dead. I tried many different batteries to make sure that was something wrong, but it doesn't turned on.I know that about 1 year many things can happen and this is a cheap device, but it is not supposed to be a dischargeable. Looking at some discussion list on Amazon, it looks to happen with many other people.So, if you are looking for a MP3 player for use on a short period of time, fell free to buy this or any other of the Sansa family.If you think it like a investment, forget it."
2,froze and quit working,"I was loving this until it just froze up and wouldn't do anything. I couldn't even power down unless I removed the battery. After troubleshooting with SanDisk support, they advised me to return it. It was just past the 30 day Amazon return policy, so I'm sending it back to SanDisk and they're sending me a new one.They offered to replace it so quickly and based on the message board here, this seems to be a fairly common issue with the m- series. I noticed that the SanDisk support line no longer even mentions the m-series, only c and e. I wonder if they are doing away with the m's."
1,Defective (multiple reports of this problem),"I bought this item as a gift for a friend. He was completely happy with it until it froze after only one week of owning it. I did not realize this was a common problem with the product until my friend started having the problem and I searched for troubleshooting advice. The only suggested solution is to return it and get a refund. If the product worked properly, everything else would've been perfect."
4,IPOD Shipod!!,Sandisk has some very nice products out there and this one is a gem.Great alternative to the highly overrated and overpriced ipod.I guess all of the ipod ads had to be paid by someone..I wonder who????
2,disappointed,The item does not work as advertised. I returned the first shipment. The return was painless and Amazon did a perfect job. The second unit acted exactly the same as the one i returned. I am unable to access the menu. I can load the memory from my computer and it plays back the songs in a random fashion over which i have no control.I DECIDED To KEEP THE THING AND USE IT AS WELL AS i CAN. I'll keep it until one of my kids wants an improved iPod and then I'll trade him.
3,I did not like it,"I did not like it. You can not make it to play files from a given folder, you have to deal with ""artist"" and ""album"" stuff, it is really hard to predict in what order it is going to play the files. I use it now since I have it already, but I would not buy it again."
2,Sandisk Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 player,"I bought this to play audible books, not music. I find it difficult to manuver through, especially to bookmark my place. If I put it on pause to attend to something else for a minute, it shuts itself off in about 30 seconds. Then you have to wait about 5 mins to turn it back on again. I like my Creative Zen much better."
4,Great by,"We have had numerous Sansa players in this line. Could not beat the price of this one. My parents got it as well to listen to music in their car. Replaceable batteries, easy to use and pocket size all make this a good buy. Get the protective silicone case as the one that comes with this is cheap. Headphones are fair, but upgrade is worth it."
1,Does not last long,"The Sansa Disk 2 GB arrived at the end of June 2008. By the end of February 2009, the on off switch stopped working. That is; the MP3 player simply stopped working. In addition, before then it repeated recorded segments in a pattern that defied explanation. This is not a good item and you should not consider it."
4,Nice product,"The device works very well. The menu navigation is a bit difficult to figure out, but for the price, it's a great deal!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I received this as a Christmas gift last month. I really liked it a lot. I didn't feel the need for something very expensive or complicated, and this really fit the bill. It had a good sound, and was easy to navigate. After maxing out the song capacity @ almost 400 songs, it suddenly stopped working last night. It will now only turn on & off, with the message ""finalizing update"" on the screen forever. This is very upsetting to me, as I was very careful with it, keeping it in the plastic case & in a ziploc bag in my purse. Also, now that I think of it, I started having a little trouble with it turning on & off a couple of weeks ago. Sometimes, I would have to push the on button 2x for it to come on. Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone, because it wasn't even worth the $20 my husband spent on it. I am very disappointed in this MP3 player. Now I have to save up for another one, when I was hoping this one would last me a while."
3,MP 3 player,"I have used this for a maybe a year now. The only problem I have is if I deleted files, the player would have brain fade and not work properly. When I add files, I do not delete any until it gets unwieldy. Then I delete all the files and am required to re-format the player before I add any new ones. I had to get help to do a re-format since it wasn't covered properly in the instruction book.Steve"
2,Bad mp3 player at a good price.,"I bought this mp3 about two years ago, when it was $90. The forward and backward speeds were very slow, not good for audiobook play. The recording volume is low. It broke in 1.5 years, so I cannot use the warranty. Now it is only $40. If you use it just for simple songs and prepare to throw it away after a year, it is pretty good."
3,Great for the Gym,"I wanted this to have something small for wearing at the gym and it's perfect for that. The battery seems to last awhile, it's lightweigh, and comes with an armband. It has a few quirks, but overall, I'm really satisfied with my purchase."
2,Unreliable - 2 for 2 failures,I bought two of these for my daughters. The first failed after two days of use (Amazon replaced - thanks!). The second failed after two months.
2,DISPLAY GOES BLANK AFTER 3 MONTHS,"THE DISPLAY GOES BLANK AFTER 3 MONTHS OF USE, SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS YOU WILL NEED IT, TO RETURN THIS LEMMON."
2,Not worth the money,"Well, for a first time Mp3 player I suppose it isn't awful... but I wouldn't spend the money again on it."
4,decent mp3 player,"I got this player as a temporary replacement for my ipod. very easy to upload music (just drag files over); pretty straight fwd as far as controls. has a very short usb cable, which i actually really liked, cuz it didnt get tangled up and was easy to find in my pile of cables.im pretty sure i did not use *all* of it's functions simply b/c i didnt need to, and i've only used it in my car, so i cannot tell you how it handles movement.overall, i am very happy with it as a backup player."
3,Not bad for the price,"The product is good but the arm bad that comes with it is not good when running because the player moves around. Also, the sound of the music is very low and not good. Overall not a bad player for the price, looks good, has radio and easy to put music on it."
4,Positive,Works as is designed and well at it as that. MP3 player and FM radio work well . The only negative is the lack of a built in speaker which would be nice to check your voice recordings from time to time such as I had with another brand.Simple to use also so it get's 4 out of 5 stars from me.
1,"Move on, it never worked well and finally froze","This is my third mp3 and I went the cheap route with this unit. I got what I paid for. The sound was so so (not very loud), the controls weren't good. But what drove me nuts and ultimately this unit against a wall was the software. The way the files were stored and the navigation caused a lot of scrolling. Then it started to freeze every once in a while. Then the unit just stopped working. I could have sent it in but for 35 bucks, not worth the time. Save yourself the headache and skip the Sansa m250."
5,satisfied customer,"While shopping around in our small town, not having a large selection to choose from and the prices being very high for an MP3 player, we decided to check online, shopping around there. What we found from your store was superior and much better priced. Our daughter was very happy with her birthday present and we thank you!"
4,Lil project,Well i fell in love with my truck over again. I can rest if i can not blast this speaker. Good price and great sound.
1,Geforce 4 MX --> Still a Geforce 2 core,The Geforce 4 MX lineup are in fact a revamp of the Geforce 2's. They are not DX 8 and most do not run DDR ram. If you are looking for a performance card in this price range you will want a Rodeon 8500. It out performs this card and isn't too expensive.
5,AWSOME CARD!!!!!!!!!,This graphic card is a high price but WORTH THE MONEY!!!This amazing card offers the best graphics in technology right now. Its SWEEETT!!!Its runs all my games smooth as u can imagine!
3,Ok if you have DSL to get new drivers.,"I just installed a new PNY Verto GeForce4 64MB MX420 AGP video card and have also also installed two of PNY's older GeForce2 64MB MX400 AGP video cards. All have worked well.First these are ...video cards designed a year ago without DDR memory, not leading edge cards that cost up to three times as much. A more modern 64Meg DDR memory card costing twice as much might be the best deal for a leading edge gamer.The major shortcomming is that I had to down load 20 megs of new drivers from nVidia to get the latest board to work correctly. Also I had to load a 8meg driver patch to get my DVD play program to work with the new card. Without DSL, you are going to have to download on your dialup modem for hours to get the software."
2,Geforce 4 MX 420 SDR not worth it!,"Well I just bought this card, and I am not too impressed since the technology is not so great on this card missing directx8 and DDR memory. I would recomand to buy ATI Rodeon 7500 or 8500. My other system runnng Rodeon 7500 is much quicker for games and even better quality, looks like these cards cost the same price. Without a doubt ATI 7500 is better for great perfomance and price!"
5,Awesome!!!!!,This card may be expensive but is well worth it. Makes all my games work better.....faster.
3,Pretty Good,"I usually stay clear of no budget horror for obvious reasons, but with all the awards it's won, this one got my attention. I don't think it's as great as some other people on here, but I have to admit it I liked it. The characters are really fleshed out and interesting, the FX blew me away, and the music is beautiful. There weren't a lot of scares, but what they did do worked, and they had quite a few fight scenes. I wish there would've been more flashbacks to help tell the story. They still managed to do a lot though, and I was always entertained. I actually got pretty wrapped up in it by the end."
5,"""A Touch of Cloth"" is as much an homage to space-age prog. rock and elevator music. What a joyous and danceable album!","""A finely woven ambient music album that manages to be witty/cheeky, amusing to listen to, relaxing, and rhythmically dynamic. Compared to previous Fila Brazillia efforts, A Touch of Cloth is more accessible in terms of its length, variety of genres mixed into the electronic instrumentation, and open-handed and somewhat sacreligious humour. Many songs on the album especially the beginning ones like Airlock Holmes, Ridden Pony, Slow Light, and others like XII and Leonids all stand out against one another in creating what technically is a little-known masterpiece that stands in the same leagues as Paul Hardcastle's album, Royksopp's Melody AM, Thievery Corp's Mirror Conspiracy, Funki Porcini's Fast Asleep, and even Radiohead's Amnesiac to a certain degree due to its variety yet independent nature. Another revival period of spacey, Ozric Tentacles liquid-dropped 70s psychedelic music?"""
2,Not worth buying,"A couple (two / three) good songs--good, not great. The rest of the songs are bad. Poor attempts at ""varied electronica"", no good beats, just jumbled mediocre music. Not worth buying, there are better Fila albums out there."
4,"New label, Same grooves","I've been waiting for a new Fila release since, well, Power Clown. I was quite surprised that the lads from Hull don't work with Pork anymore, and it's nice to see them having their own label. This is an album that shows how Fila (the band) sounds like. I haven't had the luxury of hearing the 6 piece band on their latest tours, but this album gives you a good idea what that experience would be like. I really like the groove on Bugs will Bite; the tranquility of Airlock Holmes; the melodic Spores; the freaky-jazzy Ridden Pony and so on. In short, this is a great follow up in the Fila catalog. I own all of their records and this one is (for sure) different from anything they've done. They continue to amaze me this band !"
5,THE BEST,"A have got all Fila Brazilia albums,but this one is the best. Becouse it combines Trip hop at its best with some of the best electronic sounds from the 70's,funk,jazz,all this mix with a trompet and a flute and incredible touch of guitar,to don't mention the cool and soft keyboards. you can buy this cd its guaranteed that you will love it."
4,Great chill out tunes,I originally bought this album because I had heard a Fila remix of a Radiohead song and really dug it. This album is great with the lights down low and some mood enhancers in effect. Great sound quality and pro mixing.
4,Good product,The tips are full and each tip is individually wrapped so it's more sanitary. The length is long so you can hold it better.
5,quality comforter set!,"I am very pleased with this set, I noticed though they sent a Cal king instead of the standard king size I ordered but the fit was the same.....The quality is excellent and I love the gold color. I was able to find Amadaeus 500 thread count king size sheets on QVC that matched perfectly! Only 59.99, a today's special value.I have not washed it yet and am hoping it washes it well."
4,Pagan Lore,"written well, informative, a very popular book among Wiccans. It also has good activities and meditations.I understood traditions and rituals with more depth and reason. Well worth it."
4,Urban Knights Gets Better Each Time...,"Just when you've thought that they have done their best...Ramsey Lewis comes through again,IN GRAND FASHION!This U.K.(Urban Knights) cd surpasses the other four that they have done.I gave it 4 stars simply because the two(vocal tracks)were average at best and the re-do's of two R & B classics...""I Can See Clearly Now"" simply sucks...pure SKIP material,but the old Marvin Gaye cut,""Got To Give It Up"" is FUNKY...Now,with 4 tracks down,you get 7 SUPER QUALITY Cuts left...7 out of 11 ain't bad. Kenny Garrett has left my mouth WIDE OPEN as I pump this CD in my truck...TOP TRACKS that are just SIMPLY FLAWLESS AND AWESOME are:#5 On The Up#6 King#8 No One#9 The New FunktierTHIS IS THE FIRST MUST PURCHASE JAZZ CD OF THE SUMMER...I can't wait until the Urban Knights play in my town!"
5,Love the cheesehead!,I bought this product for my nephew and he loved it. Great quality good fit. Works as a pillow too!
3,Cheese head,Well he will be getting it for Christmas. I know he will love it. He has wanted it for the longest time.So hunny hope u like it
5,kc,I am a Green Bay Packer fan and this is so much fun to have. I told my husband last year that I thought this hat was cool. He surprised me with one for my birthday. It makes watching the football game a little more exciting.
5,Packers Fan,If you are a packers fan this is a must have. It is comfortable to put on your head and its a great way to show your wisconson bloodline. Go packers! Material is soft foam. Made well.
2,Poor Quality,It doesn't seem as good as ones I've had before. The indents were ripped and you can just tell the poor quality of the cheesehead.
4,Looks good but can easily be torn apart by child,Looks great and holds together well without abuse but let a 2 year old see it and some chunks are coming out!
3,One size fits most?,"My cheesehead didn't fit my head, I had to be adjusting it because it keeps falling over my eyes. So, basically I can't really use it. It is cool to wear for a little bit just to say I have one, but I don't know if my head will ever fit it because there is such a huge gap. Note: I don't even have a small/big head. . . The condition was really good though."
5,Gotta have a cheese head!!,"All greenbay packer fans have to own a cheesehead. Our family now has two, one for him and one for me. We were them at home for everygame!!!"
4,GB Forever!,"A hat any respectable Green Bay fan would love to wear. I had to hollow it out a little bit to get a more snug fit on my melon, but that's fine since it would fit a smaller head out of the box."
2,"Classic item, but arrived in less than perfect condition","The Cheesehead is a classic item and this is the original and not a knock-off, which is great. However, the item arrived dirty and slightly torn. I do not doubt that the product I received is new, rather it looks like it was possibly damaged during shipping so it does not look like it is brand new. I understand that the material of which it is made makes it easy for it to tear and get dirty, but I feel that perhaps more care during packaging and perhaps some kind of protective wrapping could have prevented the damage. I purchased the hat as a gift and now have a dirty, torn birthday present to give."
3,"Fun, not for people looking for a deep film","I enjoy low budget movies, so I watched this one night when I was bored and had a good time. There are some moment that you can tell would be scary if it wasn't so campy. The main actress did a pretty good job, the rest of the acting is not so good, but it makes for a fun time! I wouldn't pay the price here on amazon to see it, but if you catch it really cheap, it could be worth it for the entertainment!"
1,The only murdering here was that of my eyes.,"One of the things that got me to watch the movie was the title. It got me thinking of the potential there could be for a title such as this. Of course it was a let down, though I my expectations were not high to begin with. The other thing that caught my attention was the cover art; it reminded me of the cover for American McGee's Alice. That's about all the positive things I could say about the movie."
3,some things never change,"as a high school kid i remember a buddy who purchased some clarion equipment along with other pieces to put a stereo system in his car. we laughed at him trying to figure out why it didnt work properly. well here i am 25 years later, with his shoes on. man, they're uncomfortable. took me about six or seven hours over 3 or 4 days to figure out what was causing the foul sound coming from my stereo. three amps, eight speakers, one woofer, and one equalizer. had alot to go through, began to second guess myself. then decided to wire around the equalizer. BINGO-sounds great!! not worth sending back- most upsetting was the amount of time spent to find the problem when i should have remembered,""some things never change."""
2,ok product,"dont care for it, dont like the seprate volume switch, i have to turn 3 knobs when turning on music or adjusting what i listen to. from bass knob to volume on radio to this eq. had lot of scratches on it and said new. seems lately when i buy new items they all been used and returned. the dents where bad. scratches from screw drivers on aux knob and all over. so when you see a product new . print it out. so they cant tell you that u bought refurbished, i had it with new things all used or return and i pay for it.. i loved amazon and shopping from there but its getting to point of no more. wait to people see pics of a box i got from another product it will disgust anyone who pays for something and people play soccer for it. hen i get told ill get 20 dollar gift card and never get it. so far its 40 bucks from 2 products and never got it. maybe its better to go at walmart"
1,:(,"the product is ok but too bad i got it from this seller, When i bought it i was so exited and after a couple of days i got it in the mail but turns out the the last to the right knob was bent and for some reason i wanted to think that was the way it was supposed to be so i just put it away until I came up with the money to do the installation and the guy that did it said thats not supposed to look like that but i wanted to see how it was going to work so i just told him to go ahead and install it the way it is, it works fine but every time I adjust my eq it makes me mad to think that I paid for something new and it wasn't in good condition :(...."
2,not so happy,"This EQ states its a 6 channel but in reality you can not plug in a 4 channel, (4 door speakers) in it as it only has one 2 channel main ""input"". It also has a 2 channel AUX input but that can not be used in combination with the main 2 channel ""in"", its either or. I could use it for all 4 channels but would lose fade or left/right depending how you install it. I might keep it but will give it a trial running front 2 off of it for a few days. Other than the channel issue is seams to be a very nice EQ.Clarion EQS746 1/2 DIN Graphic Equalizer with Built-in Crossover"
1,Dissapointed,"This is an awesome device, that didn't work at all. The equalizer arrived on time and in excellent condition, features included and quality of the manufacture are awesome, and the illumination of matches incredibly my dash. Unfortunately after building my sound system around this eq,spending almost four hours customizing the dash and welding and wiring for the eq I found only a ""small"" problem, the eq does not send any signal to its outputs. I tested it several times and with different devices, but it didn't do any good the eq turned on but I could not get any signal from any of its outputs. I have been installing car audio for 25 plus years and have never been so disappointed with Clarion, I chose it because they have been on the market for quite a while, they are usually pretty good but this time they let me down."
4,Nice little upgrade,"Nice, cheap upgrade! After tweaking the levels, the sound stage is greatly improved and overall everything is cleaner and fuller. The equalizer does add a little bit of noise to my system but it's barely audible. Hookup was very easy. My complaints are:RCA jacks are labeled on the unit's top, which in my case was covered once installed. Would be nice to have the back panel labeled.A couple of the knobs fell off within a few days but can be fixed if you're willing to epoxy them on forever.The taps for the bolts to secure the mounting brackets, on the sides of the unit, are teeny tiny and stip out pretty easily. Don't plan on taking it on and off the brackets too often.All minor stuff though."
1,:-(,"Died within hours ;-(, well idk if it died but i got tremondous alternator noise a shop in town tld me it was no good"
5,"Great product, Great price","For the little amount that this EQ costs, the features it has are priceless. The EQ is very good quality, it has everything you need to make your system sound great.I installed mine into the dash below my head unit. I love the Aux switch it has, as I can switch from my head unit to my ipod with the click of a button. As a wonderfully clean and crisp sound to my system. Love the fact that it has independant bass and volume control so I can control how loud my woofers are.The blue lights are nice, sometimes a little bright. Knobs are very solid and perform well. Would buy again and put into almost any car audio situation. I believe it is one of the best that amazon sells for such a reasonable price. If you buy it, you won't be sorry. Its a great product and will last.I've had mine now for almost a year and it is still in excellent condition. Has been working great!"
5,Worth the purchase if u from old school like me.,"I didn't want to change my factory radio in my 09 f150 I wanted to tide in my subs and amps to my factory. And needed something to make my music sound clearer, so i purchase this equalizer and it made the different."
4,Clarion EQS746,"excellent product, hooked up to my system with kicker subs and kenwood amp. works excellent."
1,Ugly Shelving abilities...,"This equalizer is like most on the market, it doesn't actually have the abilities one wants for an shelvable eq in a vehicle. It's muddy and overdrives it's inputs at even the lowest of input voltages. The output is unstable and loses the ability to be balanced, therefore cancelling out it's outputs. I would recommend a trunk mount equalizer from Alpine or JL."
2,clarion u let me down,ive had a clarion eq in every system ive had i started to build a new system so when it was time to get the eq i said i cant go wrong with a clarion found it it was a great price so i got the eq746 i was happy when i got it for the first time i have to say this thing is junk so i asked around and alot of people said these things r like a xbox360 some of this style eather work great or junk from the start i really hope the next one i get will b one of the good ones plus when i got it the fuse was blown and i jus took it out of the box i should have known i was going to have problems its a shame i really like clarion eqs thay never let me down till now
1,Dead out of the Box,I've been shown that this is a good product. I ordered the product for myself to have it installed when i returned from Iraq. I was excited to have it inatalled two days ago when I was told that it doesn't work at all and now I can't reach the seller (COOL N CHEAP) and am left with a 50 dollar paper weight. I love Amazon but will never..I mean ever order from Cool and worthless I mean Cheap again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,whattt,hi.Could you explain me because my product to come all dirty and used. it seems that this repaired. please give me an explanation. I hope answers thanks
1,pos died after 7 mths,"i bought it from amazon, in the process to see if the seller would warranty this. Bought it in 11/1/2010 and just found out this is a 2006 model ha ha, no warranty thru clarion. installed it in my glove box on my rhino and 7 mths later just quit working. you decide"
3,this is for those of u using amps on mids and highs as well,i bought this thinking it would boost my voltage and i would be able to tune in everything..but i didnt think it through very well being that all i have is a kicker xs 50 amp on 2 12 in l7 subs my mids and highs still are running off my head unit so there for i can only use 2 of the 7 controls.the sub control is cool and the 50 hz and 125hz is all u can use till other amps are hooked up.so be sure its what u need...
5,Love this EQ!!,This Clarion equalizer is the best I've ever had. I don't even have a head unit hooked up to it. I just run my ipod straight into it. The sound is powerful and clean. The soft blue illumination that glows from behind the knobs is very nice and not overpowering at night. The connections are all gold-plated so they conduct all the power and sound to it's maximum potential.LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
5,clarion equalizer,"This clarion equalizer is a great product to have if you are into setting up your car audio with a heavy sound. It offers great control over how the mid and hi ranges perform. Where as for the bass the built in crossover seperates the mid and hi ranges from it very well giving you pure clean bass. I like the performance of this eq, it is worth giving a try, it won't dissapoint you."
4,great product!,This eq is pretty nice and it functions very well the only bad thing about this clarion is that there is no sub input just an main input. It has a bass knob but when I turn up the bass on my highs the sub bass goes up too. But other than that I give this product a good review.
5,Crystal clear,"This Xover is the best one you can buy for the price. After installation, there was no noise coming from the speakers. You can control the Mids and highs as your taste and the speakers sound a lot clearer. Love it!"
2,Works but wears quick.,It works but i think its a knock off or something I compared it to my friends that he bought at an actual store for full price and its not the same quality.This white words by the knobs on mine wore off immediately so I you wouldn't know what the knobs did if you were new ti it. the product serial number sticker also came off in a week and its not like I'm hard on it. All of which hasn't happened to my friends and he has had his way longer than I have had mine. For the price it does the job. I think Im gonna switch to audio control though.
1,"It proves a point, that's it","A group of journalists wrote this book to find out if a deliberately bad but sex-filled novel would sell well. Unfortunately it did sell well, and sales exceeded their expectations.This book is SUPPOSED to be bad. And almost all of it is bad in dull, non-humorous way.You should remember the point this book made, but you shouldn't read it."
3,now try this,"i did not read naked came the stranger, but i read a hilarious account of how this book came about by mike mcgrady called ""stranger than naked or how to write a dirty book for fun and profit."" i am currently in search for another copy for a friend because i laughed out loud reading how 25 writers pulled a very professional hoax. hope you read it, its great!"
4,A great poolside read!,Knowing beforehand that each chapter was written by a different author was what led me to read it (I had to borrow it from a college prof since it's so hard to find)--and it in no way hindered my reading! The book came together extremely well and was a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the intertwining lives of the characters. It's become a staple on my bookshelf for when I just need a good quick read.
4,Naked Came the Stranger,Excellent book that was written in the 1960s decade. Having each chapter written by a different author is pretty cool.
2,Creepy for Armad Assante,Not what I expected from Assante.He usually plays the hero but not this time. He plays a pyhcotic killer. Definetely not whqt I expected.
4,You've got to get the whole set!,"If you've got the Iron Horse Bar Set (the shaker that looks like a train engine), you've got to get the whole set! All three pieces together make up the train. The only complaint I have about this piece is that, due to the glasses being hand made, they don't sit level with each other in the holder. Otherwise the set looks fantastic! All our friends comment on how hip and cool our bar looks with this set on display. It looks like a vintage item, but it's all shiney and new. Buy the three pieces (the 3rd being the Ice Caboose) and impress all your houseguests!"
5,"Great product, good price.",Found this part at local automotive stores at nearly double the price. The item/part was shipped promptly and at a good price.
4,Bad packaging,Someone put a label over part of the product part number on the box which was a stupid thing to do. Any customer whould want to be able to verify that what they ordered was what was in the box. There was not a part number on the part itself.
3,OK for colecting,I have this movie in my colection it is an ok movie but the bestthing about it has excelent clips of other great movies
3,good,"Ok while armin is one of the top dj in the world today, i found this album to be lacking in something. Boundires of the imagination is some of his best work, and is easy to fall into and slip away. Trance at its best."
5,My 3-year old loves them,"They are made of a fairly sturdy and semi-rigid plastic, so they are easy for my daughter to hold in place and trace. Also, each stencil comes on a scored sheet, so after you push out the stencil, you have both the inside image to trace around and the standard stencil to trace inside. These have gotten a lot of use."
3,Not what I expected.,"These stencils are very thin with no support for small hands. They will probably work better if taped down to the paper so they can't move. If the child uses a thick crayon, I believe that it will just bump off the edge of the stencil and color the stencil itself. An adult's help is encouraged to prevent frustration."
4,An attempt to explain a difficult subject,Rahner gives a noble effort to explain a subject which eludes words. Everyone knows what prayer is but no one can put into words. Rahner gives a good try.
1,WORTHLESS WASTE OF FILM AND MATERIAL!,Why won't this crap stop? I keep telling you that there is no need for a sequel to the original Children Of The Corn. CRAPY GARBAGE!
3,Best of the Corn Flicks,"How they ever got to a ""Children of the Corn IV"" beats me, but I have watched all of them now and this is easily the best of the first five! While it has little to do with the original story it is still a stylish and scarey little frightner in its own right and I enjoyed it. Naomi Watts is good, Karen Black is wonderfully over the top and some of the kids are really creepy (like these weird twin boys who get possessed -- ugh!) but it was fun and I had a great time watching it. Sure beats the heck out of the others!"
4,This movie ROCKS!,"Med student goes home to help her crazy mom and finds out that her daughter is the key to another crazy corn child's sceme to take over the cornfield and turn the children against their parents. A lot better than part III, it's much better acted, written, and more entertaining. Popcorn, pepsi and pizza."
2,children that wont stop killing people,"this movie pits the gathering of the kids to ressurect some person and then reck hell on the place. Kids start getting colds and sick all of a sudden and thats when doctor Naomi Watts come to the town and then things start happening. along the ride is the boring Karen Black who is so dumb and obnoxious in this movie your mind will emplode on impact. but it brightens up the place when you see Brent Jennings(Witness, Little Boy Blue, Tvs Buffy The Vampire Slayer) in the house. otherwise its a nonstop bore. try not to fall alseep like i did while watching it, well maybe because it was 4 int he morning, but"
2,great...another corn movie!!!,they should call this one CHILDREN OF THE CORNEY!!it's really the same as part 2 & 3 with the same old storyline.i liked the first one alot but this isn't even close. the good thing about buying this movie is it will help you sleep!!!
1,he who isnt mentioned,this is one of the worst sequels i have ever seen.it has nothing to do with children of the corn.in children of the corn they r supposed to have someone who tries to lead them to praising he who walks behind the rows.but in the movie he who walks behind the rows is never mentioned.and they didnt use propaganda to get them to follow he who walks behind the rows.they put a chip in them or something(i dont even remember it was so dumb).i still dont even know who they were following in this movie.in 1-3 they were following issac and eli into believing about he who walks behind the rows.in this one their was no he who walks behind the rows and their was no leader to lead them to a potential he who walks behind the rows.i put this on my top 10 worst movies of all time list
2,Don't feed the children,"An aspiring doctor returns home when her mother's condition takes a turn for the worse and a strange virus takes all of the children in the same town under the spell of another religious zealot. A huge noticable improvement over part III with some good performances, good effects and even a sufficent plot."
1,I Probably Will Swallow My Remote Control.,"Viewed: 8/12Rate: 18/12: Well, it was certainly disgusting to look at Karen Black. No wonder why Jack wanted to get away from her in Five Easy Pieces. Naomi Watts was better in The Ring. Anyone could have done her role in Children of the Corny IV: The Gathering, and it won't make a farthing of a difference. It's a terrible film on so many levels. What was incredible is that it is no different from all the horror films made the last decade yet Children of the Corny IV: The Gathering was rated by the viewers very lowly whilst the others made more in box office and were highly rated. To me, they are in the same league with one same enduring aspect: crap. Basically, people are killed in various ways, there isn't a sensible plot to speak of, deaths are gorier than the one before, and soul and feelings are nil. Boring, if you ask me. All in all, throw Children of the Corny IV: The Gathering in a heap of dung."
3,Don't judge a book by its cover!,"Most people would see the title and walk away, but this film isn't that bad. Gore, suspense and good fun, this is perfect for a night in with your friends..."
5,Seems well-made,I haven't used this yet. My only concern is that the plastic won't hold the fabric tightly enough. I guess I'll know soon!
4,"Good story, short on facts","I was there when this happened, there was an attempted bombing in Springs and a small bomb went off in the refinery, denting a pipe, but no fire.Still a good story about the times."
4,Catch a Fire,I teach a Catholic Social Justice Course and purchased the video to enable students in their independent study to better understand some of the issues presented in the film. I think it was very helpful and would recommend the film to anyone who might want to approach some of these issues with young people. That is where we need to start in helping to build peace in our world.
4,well done,"above average ""based on fact"" film. The actors work hard to carve out their personalities, and it sticks with you. What would you do?"
2,Writing good. Content...not so much.,"I give the writing of Jude Morgan 5 stars, the content of this one wasn't for me; too racy for my taste. Those romantics were a wild bunch."
2,"Problems, Problems, Problems","I think PNY has the worst customer support. The card failed on start up. After a full fresh install I got the video to work but many problems. The most annoying one was studdering. I tried all the tweaks Pny support suggested (new drivers, ect.)Sometimes it worked fine, other times not. So before I ended up destoying my computer out of frustration, I bought a Vison Tek geforce4 card to replace the Pny Verto and so far it works great."
3,Defective,"The card worked great on my P-4,(see Radeon 8500 review), until the card quite working all together after 3 weeks. Swapped 2 diffrent cards out and they worked fine but the Nvida card just died. I ruled out cooling, drivers, etc. I think the card has good potential, but the workmanship quality(made in China) speaks for itself. I put my Radeon 8500 back in my new system with the 6071 drivers and it rocks. Looks way better than this card and all the flaws the radeon had in the past seems to have been fixed. I would have given the Pny nvidia card 5 stars if it would not have petered out on me:("
2,There are better options,"If you are looking for a good card in this price range you should buy a Geforce3 Ti200 or better yet the Geforce4 Ti4200. Both of the Titanium series chip sets support DerectX8 features such as pixle and vertex shading and the MX series does not. If you want more bang for your buck I would suggest the Rodeon 8500 because even thought it is slightly more expensive it is worth it because you won't have to upgrade for a long, long time. Plus you'll be the envy of all your friends."
5,Another Great Album by Albert Lee,"What can I say? I have them all and this one is great.For those of us who play guitar, the tones on this album are gorgeous. Great material, beautiful guitar playing, and the debut of his daughter Alexandra, who has a beautiful voice, singing the last cut, Dimming of the Day. I love Road Runner, Rock of your Love, and Dimming of the Day. They should promote Dimming of the Day as a single along with Road Runner. I'd like to see Albert get a hit on the country charts then he'd get more recognition he deserves and we'd see more of him on TV.Albert has been picking up great the pace and putting out more recently, both with Hogan's Heroes and on his own, than he did in the past and I, for one, am very happy about that."
3,Learned a lesson!,"Pandora radio introduced me to Albert Lee's phenomenal Telecaster picking skills. I heard ""Payola Blues"" off this CD and decided to buy the whole disk on a whim.I was hoping that besides Payola Blues it would contain similar picking masterpieces.Swing and a miss!The other songs embed some great signature guitar work, but the tunes are just too far over the fence into ""My Dog Ran Off with My Woman in My Pickup Truck"" Country and Whiny Western terrain for me to follow. The fast forward button gets a workout on this CD.The lesson learned? Listen to sample cuts BEFORE you buy!"
4,Road Runner,This is a solo album by Albert and it is very very good. The tracks have been well sorted and very well performed and laid down. It is as the name implies one of those albums you would want to take on a long road trip. It leaves you feeling relaxed yet focused. Albert Lee is a fantastic artist with consumate skills as a musician in his own right.
1,What was He thinking...,"What could he have been thinking while writing this book? A bad mixture of Fleming, Clancy, and John Norman which never comes together and lost me as an interested reader in the BDSM manual section. I am glad that I got it second-hand instead of paying full price. If I ever read any of the sequels or anything else he write, I will have to get the books for free."
2,Not for Adolescents!,"I have enjoyed many of John Ringo's other books, and even some of those later in this series. But I must suggest that with its central theme of graphic sexual violence toward women, ""Ghost"" is not a book for adolescents. The book goes well beyond the battle scenes for which Ringo is known, to deal in what must be recognized as ""gratuitous"" sexual domination and rape, offered for their titillation value. In my personal world, such advocacy is ""not okay"". I had a hard time finishing this one, and I would encourage Ringo not to write another like it."
1,Is There Really A Market For This?,"Seriously, is there a ""splatter porn"" niche market the publishers are trying to mine? Because there's plenty of decent shoot-em-ups available, and there's a lot of porn out there, but is there really a call for some ""one stop shopping"" for books where the protagonist puts the hurt to Hadji, AND to every young female he runs across?In the words of Evelyn Waugh, ""Just too, too, sick-making."" The only question is why the author didn't have it published under a pen-name."
1,Mostly Porn,I was able to finish the book in only a few hours as it was easy to skip over the half of the book that was mostly cheap porn. The porn would only be interesting to those who are into sexually degrading women.The half that wasn't porn was not very believable either. Ringo has dropped several notches in my estimation with this whatever. I hesitate to even call it a novel.
1,Yuck...,Regret having bought this book... A series of more or less well written action scenes linked together by chapters of graphic bondage that seem to serve no purpose whatsoever. Surely there was some better way to indicate that the hero is a nasty guy than writing many many lovingly crafted pages of bondage and submission... Or is Ringo trying to get into the porn market - if so there were too many action scenes between the bondage porn.
3,Oh John Ringo No,"I really can't do justice to this book, since an absolute killer review of the first three books of this series was done in LiveJournal. The reviewer's opinion was that it is the worst thing he has ever read and he can't stop reading it! His coined reaction to the totally messed up situations found in this series- OH JOHN RINGO NO - is rapidly gaining cult status. And has a T-shirt! Like the books themselves, the review is not for younger readers, but is personally blessed by Ringo himself as totally fair and accurate. And hilarious."
1,A sad display of Ringo's writing skill,"It is poorly executed, very disturbing. I'm not surprised the author had to be talked into publishing it. It reads more like a private exorcism of personal demons than something intended for public consumption. The sex is disturbing, the rape was totally useless in advancing the plot.If Ringo needs to work out his sexual kinks then he needs to go see a shrink. This book is trash, buy it at a used book store."
1,Lost a reader,"This is a right wing misogynist fantasy. If that's not your cup of tea, (and I sort of thought it was only the cup of tea of 15 year old boys... at least the misogyny part)don't buy it. I threw it away. Won't buy Ringo again, he's been slowly sliding out of acceptable bounds in my mind, now he's crossed the line to where I don't want to support him at all. I picked it up on the basis of his name. having read him before i was disappointed but not totally surprised to find the content but those who haven't read him before probably didn't expect to get what they got.I can disagree with someone politically and still enjoy their work, but then I can disagree without the absolutist categorizations of those who disagree with me too. But the casual misogyny is not tolerable."
1,"Not dairy, nor meat...","It's too sexual for action thriller, not graphical/exciting/well writtern enough for good porn (I'm not into BDSM reading, but I seen one-two better books - for instance - Bertrice Small writes advenure/porn much better (she has written some bondage/slave stuff too, btw)So I will be eagerly waiting for next(if there will be next) book in Prince Roger series or in Legacy of Aldenata (Posleen War)series, but I will not buy the next book in this series..."
1,Don't buy! Main character is a child rapist.,"About two-thirds of the way through the book, the otherwise-sympathetic main character violently rapes and then sodomizes a 15 year old European girl. The violence of Islamic extremists and the sex between consenting adults earlier in the book were well within tolerable limits, but I was shocked when I realized what was happening in part 3 of the book. I had to sit and think for a moment about what I had just read. As much as I enjoy military fiction by an entertaining writer, I realized that I consider detailed descriptions of rape and sodomy of a 15 year old girl unacceptable, EVER. At a minimum, this book should be ""Adults Only"", and be considered a XXX book not to be sold to children or teenagers. I threw the book in the garbage and I will never read a book by John Ringo again."
2,The Hero is a Rapist?,"Being a retired Army officer, I understand that, for some soldiers, the violence that it is necessity to apply to be an effective soldier can cross the boundaries into one's private life. That given, it is never acceptable or condoned. To have a hero of a novel denigrate the young women he rescues as ignorant, mindless liberals unworthy of his sacrifice, spend a second episode of the book in gratuitous S&M, and then have a violent rape of a prostitute by the HERO in the third episode begs the question as to Mr. Ringo's motives and/or attitude toward women. I loved his marine SF series, but I'm deeply disappointed in his latest offerings. Very disturbing stuff from John Ringo. If he's trying to make a point, I took it to be that he has issues."
1,There are some things you just don't want to know ....,"John's local to us here in Atlanta and I've met him. But after reading ""Ghost"" I'm afraid I wish I hadn't. He's exposed some maggots that I don't want to think were crawling around in the brain of someone I've met.His character's casual acceptance of the right of men to ""buy"" women who are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation is pretty disgusting in a man who has two daughters. Yes, we know this sort of filth goes on, but for a man who has daughters to write about it casually and accept it as pretty much as an OK thing .... UGH.John, between the crapola of ""Cally's War"", the cardboard cutout characters in ""Looking Glass"" and now this - you've probably lost a fan. I doubt it matters to you much, but I certainly won't recommend you to folks - at least not without spelling out exactly which books they ought to avoid at all costs. Now could someone pass me the mental soap please?"
4,Ghost not the best but far from the worst,There is nonstop action as well as a lot of graphic violence and graphic adult content it is not John Ringo's best work but it is still far better than 85% of the stuff out there.
1,NOT a collector's item...,"I did something with this book that I've only done one other time in my life of reading (literally) hundreds of books - I took it back to the store and got my money back. I've been (and will remain) a Ringo fan, but this book celebrates the worst sorts of human depravity, treating the degredation of women as ""different strokes for different folks.""I love a good shoot-em-up, and conflicted heroes are the most realistic kind, but publishing an apologetic for ""controlled"" (I'm really searching for an adjective here) B&D; as a healthy expression of human sexuality by sandwiching it between 2 stories that show the evils of it being out of control is very disturbing. It is not what I have grown to expect from Ringo or from Baen. I hope they will not stoop this low again."
1,some liberals like guns,"Setting aside that the anti-hero is a self-admitted rapist, he saves a bevy of naked women from radical islamists, one of whom is so overcome she promises to tear up her liberal credential and forever vote Republican! As he is saving them he shouts that he ought to at least get oral sex for it. What a guy. Oh, and he only wants real news to learn of his exploits, you know, Fox. Since I already bought it, I'll use it for target practice. I'm thinking I'll use the Glock."
3,Good but tread with caution here,"This book puzzles me. There's a lot of criticsm of the plot in the other reviews, most of it justified. There are chapters that read more like a primer on safe bondage & domination sex games set in story form. The politics read like a right-wingers wet dream and have little to do with reality. There are even multiple consistency problems.Given all of this a 1-star rating should be a no-brainer--yet I find myself drawn to the book and there's no way I could give it a 1-star rating. Rating it on it's power to get me to reread it (except for the sex in book 2, most of which would only interest someone into B&D;) I would have to give it a 5. Thus I'm compromising and giving it a 3.Some of the sex can be disturbing. Everything in book 2 is consensual and thus not too disturbing even if you're not into it. Book 3, though, has a scene I would classify as rape."
1,Bait and Switch,"If you are a John Ringo fan based on the Posleen and such books as that. You are in for a shock with this one. Starts off well enough, but wow goes to where I put my copy, the garbage, in one hell of a bad way. Absolutely no reason for the graphic evil he depicted here with no warning on the cover or elsewhere. Most of us like a little sexual story now and again, but sexual evil, nah, do not need it."
2,It Could Have Been A Contender,"The first book in the Paladin series, this is less of a novel and more of a collection of short stories. This book has the potential of being very good military fiction, except that it is plagued by the authors daemons.The good parts include interesting characters, somewhat interesting situations (in the case of the first and third stories), and a clearly expert grasp on military concepts.All this good is happened by the gratuitous and fairly deviant sex throughout the book. The second story is so bad it reads more like a penthouse letter then a short story.The book was clearly written from Ringo's inner voice, and it makes me never ever want to meet the man."
1,ghost: a pale reflection of john ringo's talents,"I've always liked John ringo's hard-edged military sf -- his ability to talk in realistic terms of what it means to be a soldier and blend that with a skillfully-created future. so I was diappointed that this book was not sf. but I was even more disappointed in how shallow and one-dimensional this book is. True, the main character has character flaws. But they are so superficially described, it's like the hero is a caricature of a ""real"" person. The terrorist plot that kicks off this story is really dumb and makes no sense whatsoever. Ringo's less-than-one-dimensional portrayal of the press and ""leftie liberals"" and, yes, of conservatives too, may be a super-hawk Neo-con's fantasy, but not for a thinking person. There are much better SEAL/specops thrillers out there. don't waste your time on this dog of a book. I expect better from this fine author's word processor."
1,Poorly written action/porn,"This book is one of the worst I've ever read - and I read a lot of books. It is an action/porn from the sick mind of radical conservative, with scenes of killing Osama bin Laden, nuking a Middle Eastern nation, and the protagonist raping a young teenage girl.Avoid this book. You'll be glad you did."
1,Don't judge this book by the cover,"Does that ever apply here!On an honest cover, the ""hero"" needs to be holding a leashed nude teenager with an inset of his raping another: otherwise Ringo's little ""Sorry"" (in a submission he wrote here in Amazon) is just CYA bs.Had to agree with him though: don't read this book. I got through the majority of it (oddly enough like Ringo by skipping the endless S&M;) but finally threw it away just past his hero's rape of the 15 year old sex-slave.Change the cover to reflect the content and stack it in the alternate erotic section."
3,Good Spec-Op R-rated Sex,"I loved the first third of the book. This what I was looking for, but the middle and about 1/2 of the last third< I could have done without. If looking for a good spec-op read, then stop after the first section. If you are looking for a teenage sex book, then the middle section is for you.I hope any follow up book have a lot less sex and more spec-op."
1,inconceivable,"This book does have some fun action. However, the attemptto combine S&M; with 18 year olds girls and doom-type head shots, and completely unlikely events- i.e. randomly running into 2 nukes, and a plethera of terrorists within 2 year period, JUST doesnt work.The book is an interesting attempt at porn-terrorist-slaughter,but its not worth the money."
2,The Tijauna Bible of Action Thrillers,"I was looking for some popcorn action book to read during lunch and came across this book. It is not a novel, rather it is three short stories about the same character. The first story is a fun read, the action taking off with a bang and not letting up. The writing is not so hot, and there are a lot of unrealistic happenings that you have to let slide, but fun to read if you just want to relax and not think much. The second story is pure pornography, about on a par with what any thirteen year old boy might write. I finally had to put it aside midway through the tale when I tired of waiting for a plot to develope.If you want a comic book style action tale the first story is fine, if you want pornography there is better stuff out there."
2,"The good, the bad, and the disgusting?","I generally am a fan of the Posleen Universe books, and I was blind-sided by this novel. It started out O.K., but after the initial novella, it degenerated into something other than an action thriller. I'm not decrying the entire book--just the wierd transition to a pretty graphic and brutal sadism/masochism/dominance/bondage trash novel in an unexpected turn. I like the posleen universe a lot more. A really sad 2 stars for this one, based on the opening third of the book, which redeemed it from a ""no stars"". I think I'll skip over any more ""Ghost"" sequels."
1,There's different and then there's are you kiddin?,"I read Ghost for the SpecOps plot and violence and enjoyed the first part of the book. I don't mind the right wing fantasy, I didn't even mind the explicit sex in book 2 but I seen it done much better in keeping with a storyline and much better dialogue. I guess I gave up when the hero of the book resorted to rape. I might have cared, not condoned, but cared about the darker antihero if there was some reason pertaining to the plot but there doesn't seem to be one.The book reads like a Mack Bolan story with some very explict S&M;/rape fantasy thrown in for no reason other than the author felt like it.Too bad KILDAR( book2 ) looked promising. I'll pass..."
1,Sicko,"This right-winger's wet dream has the hero blasting liberals, slaying Arabs and playing sicko domination sex games with barely-of-age college coeds. He takes a break from that to rape a prostitute and put down the French. If this thing represents the author's personal fantasy world the man needs to get himself to the therapist right away."
2,Sex,"Way to much sex, kinky sex at that. It's supposed to be an action book but I skipped the entire middle section of the book due to the sex."
1,Buyer Beware,"I'm usually a fan of John RIngo, so I bought this book without really checking out the plot line. Caveat emptor!This book is quite a depature from his usual style of none-to-little explicit sexual content. I could have lived with the dominant/submissive sex scenes, but the rape scene near the end of the book was way too much!! This book isn't about a hero or good old american boy -- it's about a rapist. I'm not sure that anyone could accurately describe this as a ""fun read"" or ""manly adventure tale.""If you're an NRA-loving, politically-conservative misogynist this book might be for you. Myself, I'm reading future John Ringo books at the library before I even think about buying them."
1,Republican fantasy? Hah?,"Imagine yourself being in a torture chamber, one your friends has just been tortured to death in front of you, you're naked and scared to death, you don't know what is going to happen to you in the next couple hours and, magically, you've got a connection to the Internet and have a chance to talk to the outside world. You might have just a few seconds of connection time. But you don't want to talk to anybody EXCEPT Fox News. And what would you say? Among other stuff: ""I am going to vote Republican for the rest of my life!"" Hah? I don't usually care about the political stuff as long as the book is entertaining but this one is plane ridiculous."
1,Don't buy it,"Easy to set up, but unreliable. Mine broke the month after the warranty ended. Don't make this the only place you back up your data. After doing some research on various forums i found that quite a few people had exactly the same problem as me. Pay a little extra and get a different brand."
1,Don't even think about it,"Has never worked and is on its way back to Amazon. Out-of-the-box, I reformatted it for RAID 5, and thats about as far as I can get. Cannot create the shares and cannot use as anything except a doorstop. See the issues described in this thread: http://www.iomegasupportforums.com/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=21244&sid=9efc4068cc212a4bb00cc8522b7f6580"
1,"Tanked my data, not reliable","The drive was working fine for about 5 months and then it suddenly began to hang and perform slowly, the data became periodically inaccessible. Restarting the drive through the software never worked properly, it would run for over a day in what appeared to be the ""restart"" or ""shutdown"" process. The data would be inaccessible and useless to our entire office during that time. It conveniently crashed overnight 3 days before a deadline and we were fortunate to have backups running nightly of this drive otherwise all would be lost.The 'repair' feature has proved useless as well. I have yet to reformat the drive in hopes that Iomega can provide some worthwhile solution. As of now the drive says all my data is gone.As some other reviews mentioned here, the feature set is excellent, the software abysmal and the reliability unacceptable."
1,What a rip-off!,"This book has less than 30 pages of information specific to Ridgebacks, and it is not terribly accurate. The rest of the book is devoted to VERY general information about dogs. If you can read this review, make better use of your time by visiting rrcus.org, the site of the national Rhodesian Ridgeback club."
1,Waste of money.,"I hated this book. I don't even own a Ridgeback yet, and I know more about the breed than is included in this book. This is just a general dog book with a few pages of very basic breed history and breed standard info at the beginning. The pictures are nice, but otherwise it's worthless for someone who really wants to learn about the breed."
1,Not much of a stylist,"For style and clarity, Taylor is no match for William James. I would advise anyone who hasn't read James yet to get a copy from their local library. Update? Hardly. James is the deeper thinker and a far better writer."
5,Fun and informative reading!,"TV Moms is an illustrated guide which is packed with black and white photos revealing the programs and shows which created images of mothers for television audiences. From the black working single mother portrayed in Julia to Edith Bunker in All in the Family and Carol Brady in The Brady Bunch, TV Moms examines the images and roles represented by television mothers."
2,"Hate to say this,but.....","I LOVE ""Sung Tongs"" and ""Feels"".......but I hate to say it.....this goes ""nowhere"" and doesn't touch those other two releases in that it has no ""songs"" per-say,just avant-squiggles that noodle along with no aim.I was very disappointed in this after hearing those other two,and if there are more releases of this type in their catalog,I'd like to know which ones they are so I may avoid them.This is avant garde experimentalism with no ""hooks"",aggravating sounds,and I wouldn't even think there would be any reason to ever listen to it more than once for the ""experience"" of just saying that you've heard it. A ""Metal Machine Music"" for the 2000's. Some may love this,.....but it really just grates."
2,GET ANY OTHER ANIMAL COLLECTIVE RECORD OTHER THAN THIS ONE!,"So I like the Animal Collective, a lot. I didn't at first, when all I had heard were the low points of spirit they're gone, but then I heard Sung Tongs and went nuts, it is a great album. Then I got Panda Bear's album and loved that and have since purchased almost ALL OF THEIR RECORDS and the ONLY ONE THAT DOESN""T STAND UP IS THIS ONE. It just never comes together the way the others do, it sounds like they are having fun, but I am not. If you are a completist buy it, but get all the others first."
3,barons guide 2005,"hallo,this is a good book and I would suggest it to anyone who is going to university. it gives detail info about what college to go to and it is the best ... (andi poleh, chirelleh)for example are among smaller colleges but are reviewd here. highly recommended."
2,Videos are very good but nothing more,"I'm a dad of 4 (ages 1 to 6) who is fluent in Spanish. I bought this set as a way to complement my spanish with my kids since their spanish is OK but way behind their english. The videos are pretty good, but the rest of this package is a waste of money. The videos are interesting, amusing, a good pace, fluent (with no english) which are all pluses. My kids, all of them, like the videos but cannot stand the music and the booklets are useless. I would just get the videos and use the money towards other materials that will have a better chance sticking with your kids."
4,Handy All Around Knife,Nice knife. Light weight. Stays sharp after putting my own edge on it. Opens fine with left and right hand. Paint looks great after carrying it everywhere for the last 3 years. Has served its purpose in the field. For the price you cant go wrong.
5,Eric Metaxas Recommends God's Comic dvd,"Eric Metaxas writes in review of Brad Stine and God's Comic, ""If you want a taste of Stine's clean comedy--and folks, trust me, Brad is hysterical--try one of his DVDs, especially the new one titled ""God's Comic."" He reviewed in his Breakpoint commentary on October 2, 2012."
3,It's okay.,It was a gift so I don't know how it is working. I also haven't talked to the gift receiver.
2,No as funny as expected,"Had seen this comedian on TV and he was very funny; that's why I purchased the product. While the DVD has some funny moments, it's not at all what I expected."
3,not as detailed,I wasn't as impressed by this book. I am a new sock knitter and the book was not as detailed as others I've come across.
5,Best Sock Book Out There...,"...or at least in the top five! This book is an indispensable addition to any knitter's library. The socks included are beautiful, with the patterns inspired from places all over the world. It's a great book to use to expand your abilities--I'd especially recommend it for the intermediate knitter. There are several single-color socks with interesting patterns, along with a few color patterns and one *great*-looking Christmas stocking. The directions are perfectly clear, and the introduction at the front is fabulous--several different cast-on methods, etc, and the instructions actually make sense! One of the best little extras, and one that's indicative of the book's quality, is the listing of good sock yarns that are interchangeable with the yarns used for the example socks. This book was written with expertise, a sense of humor, and joy, and it really comes out in the anecdotes and the patterns. I can't say enough about it."
2,Just alright....watch the sizing!,"I am lukewarm on this book. I like the variation of yarns and patterns. However, some of these socks are very small for an adult foot. For the Whitby sock, she calls for 51 inches in a fingering weigh yarn. That's a mighty tight fit for even a slender to normal adult ankle and foot. I had to add ten stitches until the gusset and then decrease them. I've never had to do that before with a sock pattern in 20 years of sock knitting.Make sure you measure your foot/the intended recipient's foot before you knit a sock from this book!"
4,"Fantastic instructions, unclear pictures","This book is so good that I went from scarves straight to socks on its instructions alone! Some of the socks shown in the pictures inside were done in yarns that make it hard to see the patterns though. Beautiful socks, great instructions on finding substitute yarns, even the tricky stitches are explained clearly. I would recommend it even if you've never done decreases/increases before. It's just that good."
2,Disappointing,"The title should read *for the Expert traveling knitter*. The socks are very complex. There are no patterns using circular needles, which, if you are knitting on the road, are much less bulky and awkward. Also, the book itself is very thin but quite *tall* - not easy to fit into a traveling bag, although maybe they were thinking it would be going into a suitcase where thickness would be the issue. I was disappointed because there were no projects i could do."
5,wearable socks,"I really enjoyed to choose from the many sock patterns, they are more traditionelle but also wearable and fancy, some of them are really elegant, too. All the socks have a little story, how the idea came, a new stich or the land as they came alive, it was interesting to read them. As I've got the sock I'd like to knit (and have the yarn that is close to the gauge of the pattern I've chosen)I started the knitting. The pattern was clear, easy to follow and I do have one perfect sock for outdoor activities. Just have to make the other one of the pair, then I can restart my favorit action : choosing a new pattern and yarn and casting on a new project ..."
2,Not what I thought,I thought this book was about patterns that could be worked on when on the road. Nice and easy projects to take with you. But no. This book is about patterns that the author was inspired by her trips on the road. Oh well!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This printer is a waste! It looks good but the quality is horrible. It's loud and slow, especially the fax. Lexmark printers are poorly manufactured. After trying to get my last one repaired I found out from a Lexmark customer service rep that most printers don't last much more than 12 months. And instead of repairing them they just replace the printer. That should give you an idea of the quality. If you buy this make sure you get the 3 year warranty because you'll need it!"
4,Terrific!,"Prints quickly, makes good copies and doesn't take up too much space. It's great to have only one machine sitting here instead of four. My only complaint is that the ink cartridges don't last very long. We're already on the third one and have only had the machine a few weeks."
2,pushy to make you buy ink,"A warning comes up when the ink cartridge is low telling you to buy a new ink cartridge and delaying printing for 15 seconds. Even if you are making a print using only black ink and the color cartridge is ""low"" it will delay printing. The thing is, there are at least 50 copies left when it calls the cartridge low on ink, so you spend most of the life of each cartridge having to suffer long delays in printing. The support staff is in India and is no help at all. They tell you to buy bigger cartridges or clean the contacts, or other silly things, but are no help in advice for turning off the stupid warning. Don't buy it, they are greedy."
5,"Life changing commentary of the ""so-called"" minor prophets!","This commentary was awesome! You will not be able to stop reading it, and then, you will have to read your Bible because it will help increase your knowledge of the Word of God a thousand fold! The reader will soon learn that no one listed as a minor prophet was minor in their display of God's wondrous power and might."
4,captivating,"If you love adventure and interesting romance, Paradise in His Arms is for you. It was a real captivating story in the fact that Kate has such an interesting way of getting her man. And it was interesting to read of a woman in that era with such a zest for getting the man she wanted. And to make him realize he loved her all along."
5,A really entertaining story,"This is a really good book. I loved the heroine and her character and how hard she was fighting for the man she loved. I really liked the way Daniels built the story, it was funny and interesting."
5,"Best T-Shirt Ever, my favorite one","This shirt combines my love of The Grateful Dead with my love for bike riding. I always wear this shirt when I ride my bike. I have two, one that is 15 years old fadded and starting to get some holes in the sleeves, the other is brand new and I just got it from amazon. It is just like my 15 year old one. AMAZING I NEVER EVER thought I would find this shirt and bam there it was. Amazon really is the best ever. Now I can retire my old fadded glory and wear the new pride and joy. Dead Treads 4 Life!"
5,The Russians in Central Asia,One of 2 volumes. This is one of the best books i have read on Central Asia.the author does an excellent job in covering the cultures of the area and the Russian militaries influence in foreign policy through the self promotion of it's generals.
4,well im hooked...,got my set and loved it.i cant wait till the next box set.if your into Romance and Comedy check this one out.
5,"Early Dolly, Always a Standout...","I had to write only, as I completely disagree with the only other review here. This (as stated in the title),is early Dolly before she joined RCA records (at Porter Wagoner's instigation). These are the very earliest hits (Dumb Blonde & Something Fishy being her earliest charting records). I was looking for exactly this kind of disc to add to my reasonably extensive Dolly collection (this and her Letter To Heaven:Songs of Faith & Inspiration that collects Dolly's Gospel recordings together)as it truly lets you see how fully formed Dolly was pre- Wagoner, and to hear that classic Country sound that made her famous.Absolutely worth the cover price!"
5,Awesome!,My daughter and I read Wit'ch Fire when it first came out and loved it! We could hardly wait for each new book to be published and would read each in 1-2 days. Clemens' writing takes the reader into the story with such vividly described characters and events that I almost felt like I was right there with them. I felt almost disappointed that the series ended. I have purchased the entire set and everyone who has read these books has loved them!
3,Meh,"Interesting series told from a very different POV than traditional fantasy novels. The ending left a little to be desired. ""The magic of the world is now in baker's bread, etc"" Does this imply people were really bad at everyday tasks before minute amounts of magic were bestowed on them? Can't say I like it when the main character completely abolishes magic."
4,Good Series,"This is my first completion of a fantasy series and I can say I'm happy that I put in the time to read the series. The first three books are better than the final two but they all worked well as a whole. The characters are well constructed and deep, the plot is fast and fun, and the history of the land/cultures was very enjoyable to read."
3,"Tha cart is very Usefull, but let me tell you something...","I bought 2 carts. The cart is very nice, it has enough battery you can save 20 NES games and 3 GBA games. But The first day when I was transfering the info (ROMS) to the cart the USB link stoped working. I connected the other one from the other cart and It worked. But when I unplugged the second usb link it again stopped working. I have 2 weeks installing again the software, tried other machines, read a lot of forums and I can't make them to work. There are other best options that work with mini SD."
5,Rufus wainwright Sonnet 29,"Sonnet 29 by Rufus Wainwright is an absolute work of art. I recommend this album highly. The beauty that will transcend you from listening to this song, is unparalleled by any other modern album."
4,amusing and entertaining,"Though I have only been to the Atlantic side of the pyrenees, Iloved what I saw. I would like to do what these 2 guys did, seethe whole of the pyrenees. The writing is light and funny, makesfor easy reading. We can trust the brits to still have this sense of adventure."
1,How much did they actually walk?,"I felt ripped off by this book. I bought it in preparation and for inspiration on the walk I plan on taking next year.Simon and Mick, by my estimation, didn't backpack even 1/3 of the Pyrenees... they taxied it, bus rode it, hitchhiked it, but surely didn't do much walking in it. Simon even admits this towards the end of the book.Humorous at points, but a disappointment for the most part."
5,Great Book for the Young (Me too),"This book spins a tale about a family living through our Revolution. Well written and easy to read as it ties one families life into contact and involvement in our fight for independence. My only complaint is some illustrations would have been appreciated. That said, I liked it a lot!"
4,Very Bright & Versatile,"This is a light which makes use of the latest lighting technology: a single, high-power Luxeon-style LED. This is what $100 tactical police flashlights use. It's energy efficient and never burns out. The mounting system is great, quick release works well. Also works well as a regular flashlight. This is bright enough for urban riding, it illuminates the potholes 50 feet away on a street with no lights.Cons: Uses one CR123A battery, which is only reasonably priced when you buy in packs of 12. Not as bright as the halogen lights with external battery packs. Plug for external battery pack seems silly.Overall, a great light for urban visibility and reasonable illumination."
4,Exellent Light For the Money,"this liitle light works exellent, has three settings High 1watt, medium 1/2 watt and a flashing mode exellent for late rides and give enough light to be seen from a block away.Has a very steardy brace that comes with two different sizes to choose from. to mount on your handlebar. I liked the light so much that i just bought my second one. oh and the light even comes of the brace, so you can use it like a flash light im all about moultiporpouse. I would have `given it a 5 star rating but the only thing that idident like was there are two screws that hold the light to a little base on the handlebar, and my light fell off. but it was a quick fix i just simply put some longer ones on it and know it's works even better. other then that, best light for the moneyand still exellent craftememship hard to find these days!!!!! for more info go to Topeak.com you can read more about there prouducts."
2,topike bike light 1 wat,this light is brit but the battrey does not last very long at all in it so try to buy the rechargle battrey for it that will help u out !
5,Best monitor of my life,I have researched this monitor for weeks. It is still hard to believe that I was able to purchase it through Amazon for $268+shipping with no sales tax. The quality is great. I would recommend this product to anyone in a heartbeat. I have to computers in my home office and already thinking to get a second monitor like that to match the first one.
4,Pretty darn nice!,"I gotta tell ya, this monitor's picture is really, REALLY great. The stand is designed well for cord management. It's also very solid and the adjustable hight is great too. It also has an indented space for paper clips and pens and junk.Now the down side, the built in speakers suck horribly. They must be really tiny because they sound all super tinny. Also, while I do like the stand, it takes up an awful lot of room on my desk.Over all, I'm in love. Thankfully the speakers I already had work well and don't look that bad."
5,"HP W2207 22"" LCD Monitor","Every new generation brings samll improvements....but this HP 22 inch has taken a big jump forward!The displays are absolutely beautiful!! No complaints and I believe it's worth every penny. The computer magazine articles on monitors are correct....the monitor, rather than processor, is the most important selection of a system."
5,Everything I expected,"After reading the reviews, some good and some bad, I chose this monitor and I am so happy I did. I absolutely believe I couldn't find a better one at the price.The screen turned sideways gives me close to 19"" to review over long pages of computer code and has really been a joy. The software has given no problems and I like the handy buttons on the front to change from photo to game and text lighting and color changes. The photo colors are enhanced and look natural, the game mode really makes the colors more vibrant, and the text mode dims the screen enough so you don't get as fatigued from long hours. I spend between 6 - 10 hours a day with this monitor.The 2 USB connectors located on side are very welcome. It saves me from crawling around on the floor to plug something into the back of the machine, that seems so caveman now. I have an expensive video card with a digital out and now i finally get to use it. All in all a super deal."
5,No Complaints So Far,"I have had this unit just about 1 month.I had to upgrade the video card to ensure correct resolution. Not an HP problem, just the native resolution is so high some older video card can't keep up.Screen is clean and bright - No dead pixels - Colors are all bright -At cold start up the monitor starts out dim and gets brighter as it warms up over the first 60-90 seconds - I don't know if this is common with LCDs.Glare is not as bad as expected.Rotating the screen vertical is simple and creates almost life size portrait photos. I use my video card/driver for rotation.. The HP software seemed kind of buggy.Video is great and puts my TV to shame.AS OF 2-8-2008 I recommend this monitor"
4,"Rotating 22"" HP LCD Monitor","The HP W2207 22"" LCD Monitor was just what I was looking for and then some. I haven't spent the time yet to get the rotation to Portrait mode set up, but that's just a bonus feature for me to use when editing portrait oriented Photos. The monitor is bright, clear and is very sharp with good resolution. This monitor replaced a 15"" non-widescreen HP monitor that I liked very much. The only thing that I have been disappointed about is the instructions for setting up the auto rotate feature to allow me to switch between landscape and portrait orientation and vice versa.I'd recommend this monitor to anyone who needs a large monitor, especially for editing photos."
5,"HP W2207 22"" Wide Screen Flat Panel Monitor","I purchased the monitor as a combo unit with a computer. I purchased three of them and they all work great.I have them setup for my internet service and everyone really likes them. For the price its get the 22"" you won't be dissapointed. The portrait option is great for typing and really being able to see whats on your page before you print it. There is no need to see a print preview because you can see it all."
4,Nice Clear and Big Screen but picture is not HD,"If you're looking for large screen and clear (non-HD) picture, this is the one. I compared this against the 22"" Acer and 22"" Samsung and this monitor has the coolest design and more like high end glossy screen.The picture unfortunately is not HD. If you can leave with that, I would recommend it."
5,love it. plain and simple,"I bought this monitor for $249.00. So far it has exceeded my expectations. I replaced a 21"" CRT monitor. Although the colors are not as crisp, it is an excellent monitor. I don't a great computer hooked up to it, so I don't use the digital connection, but I plan to upgrade soon. The speakers are not the greatest, but I use separate speakers anyhow. The adjustable stand is rock solid. I selected this model also because it has USB ports in the left side. Great monitor for the price!"
5,GREAT MONITOR,"This is a beautiful monitor! I have researched several 22"" monitors both in person and on the web and this HP monitor is by far the best there is! The screen is vivid and it works wonderfully with Windows Vista programs. I highly recommend this monitor to anyone!"
2,Go to sleep with Vista,"The monitor originally works fine but starts sleeping after a year use under vista.I tried to reinstall OS, update driver, contact HP for solution but none of them worked.When booting, I needed to connect other monitor physically to show initial login windows screen, otherwise the screen does not respond at all.Once the desktop is loaded, unplug the other monitor cable and plug this 2207 in. This works OK but once I connect second monitor for dual screen purpose, it just goes to sleep again..HP does not offer any solution about this. You can check this at[...]If I connect this monitor to XP computer through VGA, it works just fine.Seemingly, it has bad connection with Vista.I am letting this monitor away soon"
3,Mostly Satisfied,"Nice bright monitor, except for a bad pixel this is a good purchase. No trouble with switching to vertical maode."
1,Drivers do not install properly...Stay Away...,"The CD-ROM that comes with the monitor is unable to install the drivers in Vista. Causes eternal loop which microsoft update cannot fix. Sent back entire computer and monitor. HP says that ""they are working on it"". Do yourself a favor and stay away from HP monitors with Vista. NOT COMPATIBLE!"
4,Very happy so far,"I've had the monitor for about a month now. I have not tried to adjust the colors from the native setup, so I can't comment on how difficult that will be, but I am quite certain that the screen colors are not correct. If I was a graphic designer, I probably would not be happy. However, the quality of the display is pretty good for the price I paid. I'm very happy with the monitor so far. I especially like how easy it is to adjust the height and tilt. I was pretty concerned about the reflectiveness of the screen because the coating does reflect light from behind me. On bright days, I can see my own reflection in the screen. However, after about a day, I got used to that, and am not having a problem with it."
5,"Truly awesome LCD, especially for the price... HP continues to impress!","As would any prudent buyer, I searched many flat panel monitors before my purchase of the W2207. Although time will tell, at this juncture (3 months after purchase), I could not be happier with my findings.I highly recommend thoroughly experimenting with the monitor settings so as to adequately meet your viewing needs/habits. You will find obvious differences in image projections based on settings you may default to.If this 22"" HP lasts as long as my previous flat screen CRT, I will then become ecstatic over thrilled... That's an A+ !"
5,Blows away the competition at any price,"What can I say except that if you are in the market for a widescreen 22"" monitor that no matter what your needs are this is the monitor for you. It's cheap enough to be near the lowest end of the price spectrum but is still the best in the bunch. The stand alone is worth another $50 over other monitors. I first bought the Samsung 226BW because it was on sale and had a 2 ms faster response time, but when I brought it home, the stand was WAY too low (and not adjustable) and the screen did not impress. I went back to the store and happily returned it for this monitor for $30 more with a glossy-like screen that looks cool even turned off and the best stand in the market (not only adjustable height but with swivel). Take my word for it look no further for a widescreen 22"" monitor."
5,Better Than I Could Have Hoped,"Bought One . . . LOVED IT . . . Bought TWO MORE . . . ALL are GREAT . .. This is the best monitor at the best price I have ever seen . . . And I have had the best Sony's, Dell's, Viewsonics, etc.Built in speakers however, are terrible . . ."
5,As Advertised,"I bought this monitor mainly because of the low price and positive reviews. I mainly buy re-furbished computer goods because I have never had a problem. This monitor is no different. Except for the packaging you would not know this was not a brand new monitor. I have been upgrading the monitors for my home computers and this is the third one I have purchased recently. It is also the best though it cost $50.00 more than the previous two. All are 22"" monitors. It looks real good, has multiple adjustments, is easy to adjust and best of all has a really sharp and detailed picture.I would say if an extra $50.00 does not pain you too much spend it and buy this monitor. After all you will probably spend many many hours looking at it and the extra $50.00 will long be forgotten."
2,Great Picture TERRIBLE sound,"We bought this bundled with the HP Media Center computer that also includes a TV tuner. You would think that HP would find sound is at least as important as picture. WRONG. The volume on this screen is barely audible and has no discernable bass. Terrible sound. We actually went back to the store to return it because we thought it was defective. After listening to another unit that they had set up, we realized it wasn't. If you buy this do not plan to use it for sound, even chat or casual listening. You'll think you've gone deaf!!!"
2,Noisy monitor. Beware!,This monitor has been making a noise since I bought it. It is quite annoying. The picture quality is good but the noise ruins any pleasure in owning such a nice monitor.
5,Wonderful Parents' Guide to Brokering the Peace,"This book offered very helpful practical advice, with a welcome touch of humor, on daily life with squabbling kids. The author's tips and tricks for ending the inevitable fights over sharing rooms, celebrating a sibling's birthday, and resolving holiday hassles, get right to the heart of the problem. Best of all, the solutions she offers work!

4,A chillout / downtempo classic,"This CD may have been released back in 1995, but the music in it is truly timeless: A combination of funky and jazzy instrumental downtempo songs featuring acoustic drums, synth strings, vibes, electric pianos, funky rhythm guitars and occasional vocals.The sounds on this CD may not be groundbreaking, electronically speaking, but the music is far from dated. More than 10 Years later, there are a lot of artists creating the same exact type of music featured on this CD. Good music never goes out of style!Sure, there has been a lot of quality material released by other artists after this album was released, but that doesn't diminish the originality and quality of the music on this album.If you like downtempo / chillout music, this CD will be a worthy addition to your collection!, not only you won't be dissapointed, you will probably purchase other CDs from Fila Brazillia's catalog."
4,Amazing down tempo album,"I can't believe this album has only one review here on Amazon!This CD may have been released back in 1995, but the music in it is truly timeless: A combination of funky and jazzy instrumental downtempo songs featuring acoustic drums, synth strings, vibes, electric pianos, funky rhythm guitars and occasional vocals.The sounds on this CD may not be groundbreaking, but the music sounds far from dated. More than 10 Years later, there are a lot of artists creating the same exact type of music featured on this CD. Good music never goes out of style!If you like downtempo / chillout music, this CD will be a worthy addition to your collection!, not only you won't be dissapointed, you will probably purchase other CDs from Fila Brazillia's catalog."
2,Major Disappointment,"I had such high hopes for this cd, I can honestly say that it was the most disappointing music purchase I have made all year. Perhaps I am just too big on Theivery Corporation but I found little to cheer about in this album.It is just too loopy to keep you interested and it sounds dated, I guess because 1995 is pretty dated as far as electronica goes. Regardless, spend your money on TC's mirror conspiracy if you don't already own it, you wont' be disappointed."
2,A collection of papers on workflow.,"Some good, most useless. One must dig deep to get any valuable nuggets from this one. The second half of the book is the WfMC interface specifications which doesn't appear to be any different than the specifications that can be accessed on-line, though the on-line specifications are newer and a little more up-to-date (which causes one to wonder why 1997 is in the title though there hasn't been an update to the specifications since 10/96 and the book doesn't reflect the later changes....)"
5,A good pen is hard to find,"Great, reliable pens that don't dry out, don't bleed or smear, don't leak and are comfortable to hold, but best of all, they aren't scratchy if you hold your pen at an angle. They really are 'smooth writing'. Great for left-handers especially. Fun colors in these packs. These ballpoint pens perform extremely well and last a long time. At less than $1 per pen, you can't beat the deal. I look for them by name because I know I won't be disappointed."
1,most undependable product ever purchased,"Shame on me! I have been dealing with one of these watches for over a year and it will not keep working, Have to ""reboot"" it when it locks up. Sent it off for repair and it worked for a couple of weeks and broke again. It has been sent in for repair again with the analog portion frozen. Based on so many good reviews, I figured I had a lemon so I bought another one two days ago. The analog portion froze in less than 48 hours. Last Timex I ever buy!"
3,Great watch but........,"Really like the display and look of the watch. Settings are very difficult to read, understand and make. Took it to a jeweler and he had trouble too."
2,Band Broke,"Within three weeks, band broke during normal wear, warranty does not cover band. Very unhappy."
1,Timex T41101,"I have had a Timex watch for over 9 years love it... When I was looking to buy a newer one I came across this one this did not fit me it was way, way to small.. My Timex that I have now is a nice heavy duty watch its been through alot and its still staying strong..! This watch T41101 is light weight in my eyes very poorly made.. Amazon was great about the return so if you do get this item know that Amazon is super great and will re-found your money but you will have to pay for the shipping cost to ship it back....... Out of 5 points 5 being great I give this item a -1.."
4,good watch for the price..,"This is a very good watch, and i realy love it..It is east to read, and looks realy good on your wrist..and it is not to big either..The only think is that it is not easy if you wantto adjust something..You might have to try a whilebefore you make it..But still a very good watch for the price.."
4,Best of both worlds!,"I ordered this watch as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loved it! He likes the features of digital, but was looking for a watch that was also nicer looking than digital watches, so he could wear it to dress up and go out. So far, the watch fits the bill! Some reviews say it was too small, but he actually needed to adjust it because it was a link too big. I am wondering, is there a way to set the date to display instead of the alternate time?"
5,Vastly Exceeded my Expectations,"I am a watch collector, with many high-end watches carrying names like Seiko, Bulova, Rolex, etc.That said, nothing beats a Timex. This watch has a perfect titanium look, and even more rugged than it looks. I bought this for my brother in the army, because he asked me to find him a nice watch that would hold up, look good in most occasions, and wouldn't break the bank.I couldn't be more happy with this purchase, and I'm strongly considering buying another one!"
2,"Looks Cool, Has Problem","I like the watch, but the analog portion has a problem. It doesn't keep time for me. I find that it loses seconds/minutes/hours. I believe it's because the crown pops out - stopping the analog movement. I've never had a watch with this problem before. A screw-down crown would be great, but obviously many analog watches don't have this feature, and don't suffer from the problem."
4,decent everyday watch,It is a decent everyday watch. I had no problems adjusting the band with a pair of pliers and a paper clip. As for the functions as with all of these things controlling however many functions with 4 buttons is a pain and quite frankly even for someone less than 50 his a difficulty remembering how to set Y function. bottom line - if it holds up for a number of years as a basic watch that looks decent I will be happy.
2,The band is way too short!!,The band is way too short for anyone with adult wrists. The band is way too snug and very uncomfortable. I have owned several Timex Ironman Stainless Steel watches before and this one was surprisingly small. This is a huge disappointment because I really like the brushed metal look. I am currently returning the watch to Amazon.
4,Happy customer,"Bought this Timex Expedition watch at Walmart not Amazon about ~3-4yrs ago.PROs:- No scratches on glass with continuous daily use- All features I need (including GTD friendly countdown 2 min timer)- Reasonably priced- Stylish to go with everythingCONs- Watch band discolored from friction- Bottom of watch is corroded around (disk) case back- Pin securing band has bent, here at Amazon for 1st replacement.Conclusion, 4 stars because of corrosion underneath. I would still buy this again though! Happy customer.Great watch all around. People complain that bands need replacing ~2 yrs, it's a $43 watch people... get over it."
2,"solid, but indigo light button, the failure to the first day.","The first day to try for the third time the button at the indigo light, did not return to work after I buy in usa from peru, refund costs would do to return to pay the price of this watch should be more careful in reviewing the quality of these products, do not return to buy, by the same system"
1,Timex Men's T41101,"Watch movement is Made in the Philippines, band is Made in China. Product fits small! I.am not a large person (5 ft 8 inches, 195lbs.) and even at the max expansion of the bracelet, it JUST fits. Watch seemed like a good buy for an everyday watch. FIgured that at this price it wouldn't be a pain if the watch got banged up. NO SUCH LUCK! The watc,h began malfunctioning 15 minutes after setting it up! Noticed that the digital display seconds stopped working, stuck at 12 seconds showing. Then the date function reset/reverted to original factory default (1995, 08, 15). Went through set up process again, and noticed that digital clock still works and keeps time, but seconds on digital display are stuck at 12. I was born in the Philippines, and I know the crappy stuff produced there! 38 years after leaving, it's still the same crappy stuff! Save yourself the trouble and stay away from this watch. It's going back tomorrow! I'm going to spend a few more bucks and just get a Seiko!"
2,Low Quality - Hard to use,"This is a very cheaply made watch with and exceedingly hard set up for date, stopwatch, alarm etc."
4,Timex watches,"This is the second Timex Expedition I have bought and used. Watch is very dependable, tough and able to handle rough treatment. If I need another one, it will be the same make and model. My only disappointment was the color(pewter) I expected chrome."
4,great watch overall,"I looked for a metalic analog/digital watch that wasn't silver color and this one called my attention for a nice bronced colour. It's not heavy at all and so it's nice and easy to wear. Indigloo option is nice also.Looks well for every casual ocation, size is adjustable contrary what info says, the manual does not helps much but you can guess how to set it up."
2,disapointing quality,I was disapointed with the quality and finish of this watch. The band links had corners that were almost sharp and the link to the main body of the watch was very loosely fit. The instructions for set-up and operation of the digital portion were confusing and did not work as written. I have owned two similar Pulsar watches in the same price range that are much better quality and value. I expected much better from Timex. I returned the watch for refund.
4,"excellent, inexpensive watch",needed an easy to read watch; this is ideal for that. it's accurate and great for the price.
1,poor quality control,This is the second watch of this model that I've owned. The alarm stopped working on the first one after only a year. The stem fell out of this one after ONLY ONE WEEK. It's going back.
1,Great watch that doesn't work,"Oh how I wanted to love this watch. It is very good looking, masculine and classy. The first one we received quickly but sadly, after 3 months, it did not keep the time. Back to Amazon (stellar return policy) and they shipped a replacement.The watch worked for only 2 months this time. At first the time was off, much to slow. Then it began this high pitched whistling noise. No joke. We couldn't remove the back of the watch to take out the battery, so wrapped it in some towels and stashed it in a drawer until it ran out of gas. Now we have this great looking, dead watch. Won't send it back this time, just looking around for another one. Sigh..."
3,looks like a good watch... but,"Just received the watch. It looked like a good watch - got good reviews. Looks good when its out of the box, but the band is small. I have an 8.5"" diameter wrist and it barely went over my hand, and was very tight on my wrist. Can't find extra links for sale online, so unfortunately having to return it to Amazon."
3,Good for everyday time keeping but not much else.,"Its not much of a chronograph, the buttons are too difficult to figure out how to change the digital display to what function you want and the instructions don't always help get the right outcome. Keeps good time and the watch is easy to read. Price is high for the lack of easy functionality."
2,"Good watch for the price, but some backdraws","Its a good watch for that price, but as some other buyers have mentioned before:1. It has a cheap sense once you wear it, too light for my taste.2. YES, The Metal Wrist Band is indeed a little short, luckily it fitted just right on my wrist, at least 1 extra link should be attached with the product.Other than that, it's fine, the functions works good, but are a little confusing to use."
2,Looks great online. Flimsy & cheap quality. = ( Disappointed,"Great design. Super functional. But cheap feel, weight and band. Even my wife was disappointed by her first glance.If Timex put more sturdy weight, band and thickness, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."
4,options,"Very good looking watch and wristband, exceeded my expectations. A recent purchase, long term reliability unknown. I am a long time TIMEX user so I depend on their history of dependability. Programming the options on this model are not intuitive and difficult to implement. Enclosed instructions are not ""model specific"" and are awkwardly presented or not there at all."
2,Not a good gun,"This is an all around horrible gun. It breaks balls, is not accurate, and does not work in bad weather. DO NOT GET THE SPYDER XTRA!!! get the Spyder Sonix, Spyder TL-R, Tippmann A-5, or Tippmann 98 Custom instead"
4,Great CD Player,This is a gret Cd player i just got it yesterday and it is excellent. There is one downside though. The batteries. The recharagable batteries suck. They loose energy really fast when playing Cd's. The external battery pack just gets in the way. That gives you The 23 hours of play time. Every thing else is great. For the earphonesw they give u extra coushining incase you lose one or two. The sound is great. The remote is great but dont be to rough with it. It plays all Cds and i love it. The bass boost is great and it is basically impossible to have it skip when playing your music. This is a great buy but the batteries just make the rating go down one star to me.
1,Skips too much,"Looks great, but skips while walking, which renders it useless. Takes a long time to load a disk. For that kind of money should perform better. Had to return mine and will get a Sony or a Panasonic."
3,Don't buy unless willing to replace within two years -Part 2,"I ACTUALLY purchased the player sometime in February of 2003 (oh dear, I am losing track of time -.-).Also, I am a fan of Japanese pop music and many of the CDs I have purchased... let's just say that my iRiver SlimX isn't too fond of them."
1,Poor battery life,"I bought the player for my son. He loves the size and function of the player, except for the battery life. Unfortunately, this problem makes the player almost useless.My son doesn't want to use the AA battery attachment hanging out from a cable. It doesn't look cool. I sympathize since the size (thin) is a big attraction.We have used the discharge and charge feature but can only get a few hours of play time off of the rechargeable batteries. We have give it two months now and the battery life has not improved with use.I am very disappointed with the battery life. Given the choice, I would not buy this model again."
5,Excellent first impression,"I've only had the player for a couple weeks, but my first impressions are highly favorable. The player is very full-featured. As a techno-geek, that floats my boat. The controls are intuitive for me. Navigation is convenient. Before buying this unit, I tried several Sony units and a Phillips model. None of them implemented navigation as well.This player works well with my audio books and old time radio files. VBR and extremely long files are no problem. Bookmarks are available so it's easy to get back to a particular location. The player remembers where one stopped in the file and resumes from that location. If yours doesn't, check the settings. It should.Caution: I use the player in cars and in other sedentary applications. It may not work well riding on a hip."
5,Amazing!,"Wonderful CD Player, it's slim, it plays mp3 (reads ID3 tags and browsable), CDA, stereo FM tuner, and even has visualization plus graphic equalizer. A little bit pricey but sure it worths."
2,ugh..,"i cant stand it. i dont know how so many people rave about how great it is, because i just cant stand it! i iwsh i had baught somthing else...i realy do. i find the remote wires getting tangled up constantly, and the case is completely unlogical. the only reason i gave it a two is because it worked. after about 10 seconds waiting for the cd to load. its great if u have an mp3 cd with hundreds of songs, then its ok to take 10 seconds..but when u just have a normal cd...waiting that long isnt good. I aslo have a few problems with it skipping...maybe i just got a bad one, but i dont know about you, but skipping drives me crazy!"
2,You'd better have good eyes,"I bought two of these, one as a gift and one for myself. The sound quality is OK but no better. There's aliasing of high notes when playing MP3s. The user interface is all through a 1 inch by half inch, low contrast LCD display and the type face is difficult to read in low light and the controls are a set of multi-function switches. You _need_ to read the display because some of the modes and functions are critical and the method for invoking them isn't obvious. It took me a lot of false starts before I got it out of the mode where every song got repeated indefinitely unless you manually advance the play list. You also need to control the battery charging mode. Just plugging the damn thing in and leaving it for 12 hours will result in...nothing."
1,Steer Far Clear!,"I have a college degree in Engineering and can not get this worthless player to work. It has such a bewildering array of menus and options that it is often impossible to tell where you are. Often times I give up and remove it's batteries to clear out it's memory, and that seems to work. (Hint: you need to keep the batteries out for a few hours).I purchased this player because I wanted one that has a shuffle function. Unfortunately the designers went with the more functions are better attitude when they designed this thing, and went far, far overboard. There are six main menus with up to eight submenus within. Navigation is difficult with only four buttons that must be pushed in just the right way for just the right fraction of a second in order to get the desired function and not something unexpected. It can be a nightmare when you get lost among all the menus.My advice is to steer far clear of this rediculous thing and try to find a simpler, more basic player."
2,Skip Free? I don't think so!,"The ad boasts ""best anti-skip protection around"". I must be doing something wrong because this thing skips constantly. You can't jog with it or even power walk with it. Overall, nice to have something that will play MP3s, but not worth the money!!"
5,The best of the best,I believe that this is really a great MP3 and I am enjoying exploring and learning about it. The only draw back is the the small print on on the remote. I love how light it is and the shape of the player is so elegant and funky!
2,"nice, but be cautious","When I got this puppy I was pleasently surprised by its functionality and performance, especially the sound quality. The remote is almost perfect and makes navigation quite simple. This could be a great alternative to the iPod if the batteries didn't die on me after 1.5 hours of constant listening. That's right. The first day I had no problem with batteries, I think I listened to that thing for 5 or 6 hours straight. But once you recharge them, or discharge and recharge, forget about listening to it longer than 1.5 hours. There is an external battery charger, but then the whole idea of 'slim' goes away. So unless you're eager to carry all that additional weight in an unattractive carrying case, don't bother buying this player. Save your money and get an iPod. I got no problem fitting 190 mp3's on one cd and that was plenty for me, but so what if I can listen to half of them on the go? Think twice before you buy this player. I'm returning mine."
1,Bad right out of the box,"Recieved the unit two days ago. It really looks good. All of the parts and the manual were included with the unit. Sounds great ... Then the problem started. I tried to use it! I must have changed the position of the battries and hold switch(s) 10 times. I could not get the drawn thing to power-up. I tried the AAA bateries and still nothing. Then to add insult to injury, I called,left several messages and emailed iRiver ... I am still waiting for a response. I realize that my problem is out of the box and that the unit may well be OK. But, I decided to send it back to Amazon and get another unit. Because of the way Amazon has handled this matter I will certaily buy my new MP3/CD player from them."
4,Really nice player,"i bought it a couple days ago, and its been quite good, i upgraded the firmware in about a minute or so, and i havent had any problem with it.2 things: first, its a little slow to read (but i guess it depends on how many mp3 are on the cd) and the second.. lack of carrying case.but a 4 overall!!"
1,What is this????,"When I first took it out of the package it looked great, and I was amazed with all the great things it does. Then the remote didn't want to work and the anti- skip(like it wasn't even their). This was the player I went to get after I decided to retire my sony(D-EG3)after 4 years of most gruesome use. I was disappointed with the iRiver SlimX iMP-350. Perhaps I'll stick with sony."
5,The Best I've Owned!,"I am on my 4th portable CD player and this by far is the best hands down. Besides having great looks and a thin profile, this player kicks out some great sound. The user interface is very easy to use and understand, I had no problem taking the SlimX out of the box and get up and running. Shock protection has performed as promised, have not heard a skip yet. If I have one issue it would be in the earbuds, could be updgraded.If you are looking for a CD/MP3 player give the iRiver SlimX a good look. You will not be disappointed."
1,does not work,"I've tried two units and neither one worked for more than a week. On one unit one of the earphones broke, too. Very frustrating."
2,wel....,"it's a great cd-mp3 player, but i gave it 2 stars because there is one big problem with it. if you put the volume up past half way it distorts. it doesn't matter if you are playing mp3s, or right off a regular music cd, it always distorts, which is probably why i almost never use it and haven't left the house with it yet."
1,More Bad News than Good,"This player has done the job for a while. I was not and still am not impressed by the unit. It takes quite a while to load a CD and that drives me crazy. I am on amazon looking for a new system as I type. Another down side is the external battery pack and rechargable battaries. Its a pain to have to recharge the system when I could simply replace the batteries on a differant system. Also, the external battery pack makes it hard to organize all the the loose cords. I know the unit comes with a case, but it was unexeptable at best. If you are looking for a CD/MP3 player, do yourself a favor and stay away from this one. The only good thing to this is that it is thin. But that is only a superficial benifit."
2,"Love in begging, ending in divorce",I bough this CD player 3 months ago and it was amazing. It did everything. After I realized I needed more space than 700MB disc and am so lazy to bring more than 2 disc. I wanted a iPod ir a Jukebox by Nomad. Now after these 3 months my remote has an issue with the headphone jack and it is amazingly staticy. So maybe I would recomend the Imp-500 is you where bold. But I would go with a jukebox of some sort due to more advantages.
1,Lemon,"I don't know if I just go a lemon, but, my player performed poorly with CDs and not at all with MP3s. Tried media on other players and they worked fine. Item was returned."
3,almost made it a year...,"well the slim x 350 did many things with me..it went to school, on many trips across america, and just played music for the ears of my frinds and mine. but after about 9 months of having it, the cd reader began to fault! it would read no disc and i wanted to drop it i hated it for turning on me..but it did."
2,forget about it...,"At first this seem like the price is might be worth buying this CD player. After all it plays CD's, MP3's, and has a built in radio. But its so NOT worth it. I bought it thinking that this would be the last CD player I would ever get. When I put in an MP3 cd it takes FOREVER to begin to play it. Sometimes it does not play it at all. And I don't mean a few track, I mean the entire CD. The letter on the control are way too small. It can also take a while for it to play regular CD's. However, it does have some good features. It does have a great sound. And the FM/AM radio has a pretty good reception. There are new CD/MP3/radio player coming out. I say check out those before you think of buying this one."
5,Great-Worth the extra $$$,There are a whole bunch of MP3/CD players on the market today. You can probably find one for $.... However this one is really worth the extra money.You can customize nearly every feature imaginable on the device. It supports multiple languages and it also has an FM radio.The battery life is supurb. I normally get around 6-10 hours on a full charge (depending on how loud I'm playing it on my headphones) and if you plug it the extra battery kit you can probably hit a 20 hour battery life (the website says 24 hours).This thing is also quite stylish and after a small learning curve very comfortable to use. I personally wouldn't reccomend upgrading to the 400. It seems the only difference is a slightly (and I mean slightly) smaller design. If you can get the 350 at under $...I would go for it.
1,Great.... while it works,"Mine was great, rechargable batteries, MP3 reader, FM radio. Great for travel, and I loved it until it broke. They replaced it, since it was within one year, and I had kept all the paperwork. Then the new one worked fine for a few months, and then broke too. It would be a great product if it didn't break so often. How unfortunate."
1,No Disc again,"8 months I've had this, I had to RMA the 1st one because it came broken, giving no disc errors. Now this one dies with no disc errors also. 6 months ago I would have given this 5 stars, but now with it breaking again along with many other people ending up with dead players just like me, I'll never buy iRiver again."
5,Awesome for the price,"I just bought mine a few days ago and I love it. I've had cd players forever but this one is very unique, considering it's tons of features, the remote and awesome sound quality. I am one of those techy geeks when it comes to sound.Trust me it's worth it....."
1,save your money,"I had nothing but problems with this thing from the day I got it, and their tech support was useless. I sent it right back"
3,battery's life is too short!!!,"I used this player for a week and returned it back (...)because of too short bettery's life. I charged them to full level and they died in couple of hours. The display was blinking about an hour before switching the power off after recharging.The sound was good though, there's nothing to say about.Remote is too small and a little confusing to operate.I think this player is not ready for mass production, or maybe it's just a defective item.Whoever is going to buy this player, please be aware of the issues described above."
4,"Thin, Great Sound","Loads of features, thin design, and great sound makes this a wonderful CD-MP3 player. However, I find the way the wire on the remote control positioned ackwardly and I wish there was a display on the player itself so that I could operate it without the remote control when I feel like it."
1,It died after 3 months,"I loved it when it worked: great features, no problems with WMA, good battery life (though not as good as advertised). But after a couple of months it became prone to freezing when reading MP3 and WMA files, which became increasingly worse over time, and now it won't even read factory-pressed CDs. The disc just spins and spins, trying to boot up but failing. I didn't drop it or abuse it in any way. This is a huge disappointment."
1,worst tech support,"i am, well was a fan of iriver products. i bought this imp350 player a year back i.e. 2003, and now it stops playing mp3 files but only plays fm. the darn player wont even load the cd. i contact support and they tell me they wont replace or even service the player after the 1 year wrrnty period. now that sucks, im stuck with a player that cost me $140 and now it plays FM.in other words, if u want quality and reliability, go for sony or any other mp3 player"
5,FRIKEN' AWESOME!(...),"I swear u won't be able too find a mutch better cd/mp3 player anywhere else!!! Plus, this is the best price around, all the other prices r the same or higher. Everything about this thing is awesome! I'll list them!(...)Good things:Everything.From FM tuner to mp3 cds great stereo & extremly slim!Bad things: Nothing except the remote. It's not bad but its sorta hard to use. But(...) fur me after u read the remote part of the manual ur all set!"
1,Not as good as it used to be.....,"I brought this CD player last December (2002) as a christmas gift. 6 months into it, it started skipping while I was walking. Then it started reading MP3 CD's slower. Sometimes it doesn't come on when I have the power cord in it. Now I just want to send it back. It's not worth it. Don't waste your money. You'll be happy with it for a few months and then...........forget about it."
5,good cd player,i have this cd player... very thin and if u carry it around everyone will notice it... all my friends were like that's a sweet cd player... it has long battery time. and one of my friend actually went out and bought one after he saw mine.. radio works good but i ususally store up to 200 songs in a cd so i usually listen to cd on it.. and one bad thing is that remote screen gets scratched easily... so u beta be careful with it... becuase without the remote this cd player is useless
1,SLIMX- A WASTE OF TOTAL MONEY!,"I bought this for [quite a bit of money] a year ago (what a pricey gadget). The battery life was TERRIBLE. Ihad to recharge everyday. Next, the display does not stay lit unless you change volume or song. It is also very flimsy. It was dropped once about 3 feet and it immediately broke. I am happy about it, because it took over 20 seconds to turn on, and had WAY TOO MANY CHORDS. you have cords for the AA battery slot (the rechargable battery has terrible capacity), the display, the headphones! I reember people laughing at me because of all the cords! Save $100 bucks and buy a normalcd player WHAT A WASTE!"
1,Don't Buy. Awful Product. Deceptive Advertising,"I was excited to purchase this CD/MP3/FM player. Battery life life advertised up to 23 hours. Battery life was terrible. When you read the fine print in the manual at the iRiver.com website, it says 7-8 hours on internal rechargable batteries, not 23. I ran several tests on two differnet units and each time I got only 4 hours, 15 minutes for a standard CD. To get more time you need the external pod. But the pod dangles off to the side, so the unit isn't so slim anymore.The remote is hard to read and it also dangles and gets tangled with the headphone wire.My recommendation is to buy a standard CD/MP3 player that operates on two AA batteries and provides at least 15-20 hours. Buy it at a local store so you can easily return it if not satisfied. If you really need the FM radio, then wait for sombody else to manufacture one.In two words"
3,Still Kicking it around,"great product, and i am still kicking this around but not using it as much as i used to. i used this for several years and worked like a charm, upgrades are easy. best feature is that it plays all formats. bad feature is that it's limited storage :("
5,Nice,Ditto all the positivesI do wish the radio had AM operation. Some of the functions like bookmarking are a little tricky.
2,"Good , but last only some month","I bought this discman in the same time than a friend did. And we had the same results:The sound is amazing, in the end anti skip is good, it reads cd's quite fast, upgrading system is very intresting and it really works.But batter last for 6 hours (aprox), and anti skip goes down. (in fact now my anti skip do not work anymore). The reader do not work anymore. Sincerly i'm very upset.And my friend to.I think it may be cheaper."
4,Great quality in a small package,"It's compact size and upgradeable ( via the website ) software makes it a must have for audiophiles. Burn your fav albums or radio shows to an mp3 to a cdr or cdrw and take them with you.Fit 10 - 20 albums on a disc depending on what bitrate you use.You'll never run out of music!My one gripe about the unit( and it's a minor one) is that this thing eats batteries, and the battery indicator isn't the most accurate. it shows battery power as full till you have about 30 min playing time left at which point it show half or a quartr full.Other than that i'd recommend this hybrid cd/mp3 player to anyone."
3,"Good, but not Great Player","I read the glowing reviews here and decided to upgrade from my CD-only player. I didn't like the fact that it makes alot of noise when ""pre-loading"" the CD, and it does take about 20 seconds and even longer for a CDRW to do so. It is just as flat as my normal CD player, but it is much wider too. Another reason why I don't give this a 5-star rating is that the equalizer is pretty .... Forget about any DSP surround sound you get with just listening to MP3s on your PC with a Sound Blaster sound card. Not even the simple DSP settings I got with my CD player like live and extra bass. Everything just sounds like FM radio. But I guess you don't need that when you're outdoors with all the noise anyhow. It is extremely convenient to have 150 songs on one CD and the playlist ability, but you sacrifice a little quality for alot of convenience. Still very good buy for the price."
5,Worked great in the Middle East,"I bought this before deploying to the middle east for several months. Instead of carrying 300 standard CDs with me, I burned them all onto MP3 discs and took them with me. It's been in the dirt, dust, sun, and sand and no problems. Great battery life, great sound. It traveled with me to virtually every country in the middle east and endured hundreds of hours of use without the slightest defect. I did extensive research before purchasing this and you simply can't beat it."
4,Great Mp3 CD Player,"This was an excellent buy except for the fact that the battery life of the rechargeable batteries is very poor. The batteries got exhausted in about 3 hours. Apart from that lil' problem, this is a definite must-buy. I just wish they give a better carry bag than that is given now. Its too flimsy. It is one of the slimmest players I have seen and does live upto its reputation."
5,Great except for AC Adapter,"I purchased this last month to take on my vacation. I didn't want to carry alot of different cd's so I carried 3 with I can't even imagine how many hours of music. I used different headphones as I am not a fan of the in ear ones. The sound is great, it's easy to use. My only problem was that after the first time I used the charger, it would charge again. I returned it for an exchange and I'm still waiting.The FM tuner is an added plus. It's also upgradeable so you can't go wrong for the money."
2,A feature packed CD player but missed something very basic,"I have been watching this CD player on Amazon.com for several months. I saw a lot of rev reviews here. Finally I took the plunge. I was very excited when I received the package. It is packed with tons of features. Nothing looked wrong. However, when I get the earphone in, I heard some background noise. I lowered the volume. I still hear the noise. I changed some CD, it is still there. I couldn't hear it for more than a minute. Sorry. I have to return it. For me, it missed the very basic function of a CD player. Nothing else matters. I have to go back to my 10 year old Sony Diskman!"
4,It is okay...,"I really do enjoy having this CD/MP3 Player because it can fit in many places. I do not enjoy the long cord, though. One day my friends boyfriend took my CD player and pressed one button (the volume button, I think), and suddenly the remote did not work. Well, it worked, but whenever I do so much as press a button, the screen goes away. So now I am basically guessing as to what I am doing, and because I have had it for a few months, I know how to use it pretty well. The manual for it I found to be very confusing, so I have no idea how to use MP3's on it, but I prefer my CDs, anyway.It is okay, but I am sure there is something much better out there; but probably not this inexpensive."
3,It's great when it works!,"I'm glad I'm not the only puzzle user out there! I have it for almost a year by now, and still love it when it works. I am referring to MP3 CDs... It has no problem reading the older TDK CDRs (blue dye), however, it doesn't reconize the newer CDRs (tried different brands/burn speed/burners), it'd just spin and spin, sometimes it displayed the infamous NO DISC error, but most of time it just spins endlessly. What I can't understand is why it's not behaving consistently on the same MP3 CD! At times it reads a disc w/o problem, then there are times it just spins or freeze up after a while. The discs are fine, for they play fine on other MP3 portable, such as the $50 Pansonic SL420. I had emailed to iRiver and no one ever got back to me!Can someone please tell me what brand of CDRs that would work on this player? I find that it's hard to find a brand that it likes, for even within the same batch of CDRs, the player may be happy with one disc but not the others."
5,Don't bother with the others,"This is the player you've been waiting for. I bought mine on the first day IRiver started selling them and I love it. Upgradeable firmware...long battery life (with rechargeable internal batteries and an external battery pack for good measure)...small size for carrying...and a remote control with a screen so you can carry the player in your backpack and control it with just the small remote.I use it for music and audiobooks and old time radio, and so far it has handled every compression level I've thrown at it.If you've been waiting to buy a MP3 CD player, don't wait any longer. Go for it. You won't regret it."
2,Remote problems+No rebate,"Remote - When i bought the player the remote's backlight wasn't working.I returned it(Amazon we're really great)and got a new one that didn't have this problem.4 months later the backlight simply died and i have to buy a new remote for $25.Rebate - After i got the second player i took off all the labels needed for the rebate,did everything the paper(rebate instructions) included said,but 8 weeks later(when i should've got a cheque) they said that i didn't include the proper papers(i took off all the labels from the box!everything they asked..) and that i will not be getting my rebate.Here is my advice:Don't buy from iRiver,and even if you do-don't buy something with a rebate from iRiver- you'll work too hard to get what you deserve.P.S.- Besides the reliability problems and rebate problems the player is good,that's why i gave them 2 stars and not 1."
5,Perfect!,"It's absolutely wonderful. I got it three days ago and I am in love with it. It is very complex, but simple to use. So far I haven't seen a single negative thing about it. I have read people complain that it did not come with a good carrying case, but I like the velvet bag it came with, because it can hold the earphones, remote control, and external battery back. I also don't find the earphones to be uncomfortable, as some other people have complained. Besides, you can use any type of headphones you want. I just burned my first MP3 CD yesterday. It plays perfectly on the SlimX. I also downloaded the new firmware software from iRiver's website. It was simple to install and it was a noticeable improvement over the previous version. Overall, this product is FANTASTIC!"
2,Its thin...,"Thats all I really have to say about it. I bought it thinking it has the best anti-skip out there, but I take it on jogs and it starts skipping. I can take my panasonic cd player thats about 6 years old and it doesn't skip a beat on my jogs. The battery life is horrible--will last you about 4 hours if you're lucky. Don't waste your money on this."
4,bacillus sphaericus,i have recently got this mp3 player. i think this is the excellent deal that i have ever got for the MP3 players. its nice and handy. it operates on AA as well as given rechargeble batteries.nice voice quality.i have got it for 99 $ from best buy --- 30 $ mail in rebate.before that i had SONY MP3 player that was excellent too but that was for 130 $ and with less features.
1,Don't buy this.,"This horrible, overpriced P.O.S. is the buggiest, most unstable player I've ever owed. This is even after the firmware upgrade. It skips when I walk.... Yeah, WHEN I WALK! And sometimes it skips just like a record player would. It doesn't like some CD's, and it will simply just stay on, spinning the CD, claiming it's loading when nothings happening, wasting battery life. SO you go ahead and plug in the ""spare"" AA battery attachment -- drinks those batteries like kool-aid on a hot day. Very clunky, and unnatural design makes taking it from place to place without the 'remote' unquestionable. and it's touchy slightest movement controls ensure that you'll accidentally change a song you're enjoying when you reach for something. The NI-CAD batteries are difficult to get out, and hard to find replacements for... Once I get a new MP3 player, I plan on skipping this piece of crap as far as I can into the nearest body of water."
4,Really good,"I had read tons of reviews before I purchased this CD/MP3 player, which turned out to be the right choice, so far. The sound quality is rated at 4.5, and the whole engineering is rated at 4.0. However, as noted by quite some reviewers, the carrying bag is terrible and probably you might just want to discard it... It's a good one, especially for the price.And it is not made in Japan. In fact, it is made in China. I don't like Japanese stuff."
2,serios problem with these products,"when i first got this cd player i was really happy and knew i was getting a desent cd player.Is all of that right no because 2 times i recieved a player that either cant play my cds without skipping the last tracks,or not even working from minor scraches that any player can play from.to top it off i tried brand new cds and the same problem.I dont get it i returned the cd player 2 times with same problem im sure more than myself had this problem with this player."
2,doesn't live up to the hype,"I have two primary complaints about this unit:1) the batteries that are included with this unit only last about two hours at most.2) the remote's interface is clunky, and hard to operate. just getting it into recharge mode is tricky (hint: put a CD in, and then open the case when the unit is plugged in)3) the unit turns itself off when you unplug it from an external power source4) the headphones that come with the unit [are not quality]ok, 4 complaints"
4,Better on DVD,"Friends is a great show, but the DVD is cheaper, and will last much longer, it also has special features that the vhs does not, I gave it four stars since the show is great and as funny as ever."
5,6 Stars If Possible,No Television show can even compare to Friends. It is the essence of comic. This is one of their best seasons.
2,not multi cultural friends.,"these are group of friends with no consideration for multiracial friends. the laugh lines are forced. jokes are corny.the series ""big bang theory"" has a much better humorous script and better punch lines than this one."
5,It just keeps getting better,"If you read my reviews for the previous two seasons of Friends, you know that I am catching up on my favorite sitcom because I was unable to watch it regularly after about the fourth or fifth season. Therefore, I cannot yet say that season 3 is my favorite season of all of them, but it is definitely my favorite out of the first three. The storylines are funnier and more developed, the acting is incredible (especially in The One The Morning After...fantastic job by Aniston and Schwimmer), and the season ends with you wanting more! My favorite episodes in this season are:The One Where No One's ReadyThe One With the FlashbackThe One With the FootballThe One With All the JealousyThe One Where Monica and Richard are FriendsThe One the Morning AfterThe One With the Hypnosis TapeThe One With the Tiny T-ShirtThe One With a Chick and a DuckThe One At the BeachNext up: Season 4!"
4,Unfortunately........,"My rating isn't based on the package I received, it's based on the fact that I know Friends episodes are always funny/enjoyable. I can't rate the package I ordered, because unfortunately it was stolen and I never received. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter, but never made it to us. I ordered several seasons, 1 - 3, but only received Season 1 :("
1,Am I the only one who thinks this show sucks ?,Is this supposed to be funny ? Am I supposed to laugh at this ??
4,Inconsistent season,"TOW ""No one is ready"" is superb. The ensemble plays it masterfully and the skits are very well-written.I'm not sure what the writers accomplished with the chick and the duck. I respect the way the show maintains continuity in plot and character, and the chick and the duck show up in the final episode. Just stretches the imagination a little too much.Perhaps the fight and break-up of Rachel-Ross as brutally as it is played out in this season is necessary to set up the comedy and tension which works so well in Season 8. I found it to be too real in Season 3, or maybe I had already embraced Ross/Rachel as real-time people. Their break-up was painful for me."
4,Really good,the DVD was great it was packaged prefectly and i have no complaints however it did take at lease 3 weeks to come.
4,A Good Season,"This season had more funny episodes but wasn't quite as good as season two. Ross and Rachel break up, which means that there are two episodes in the middle that aren't alot of fun, but overall a strong season. Worth buying and watching."
5,motor cycle lover,"as i've said in my other reviews, how can a person go wrong watching these episodes? they are all great and this one is too. they get better as the years roll on and the chemistry among the cast just gets better. they are a riot and many laughs."
3,Some bugs in the menus,"I noticed some inconsistencies in the formatting of the DVDs. For example, on Disc 2 of Season 3, if you press ""Play"" to play all episodes consecutively, you can skip to the next episode using the forward arrow. However, you can't do this on Disc 1 of the same series. On one disk, you can forward through the episode you'd like to skip and it will automatically stop when it gets to the next chapter (episode) but on other discs it doesn't. Very odd."
4,pretty good season,This was a really good season for any friends fan.The only thing was that its storryline was'nt to good in some episodes otherwisw a great season
4,friends season 3,"It is another great season, plays fine and is fun for all. I would recommend friends as a wholesome comedy."
1,Snore,Friends is so boring. I don't understand why people watch it. Chandler is the only funny one and they don't give him nearly enough lines.
3,Not Actual Dots...,"I suppose I should have known better when seeing that the product states that it is a ""continuous line"". I purchased glue dots before, and remember them being actual dots, which I really liked for scrapbooking. Just know that this is actually a line of double-sided glue. Still works great... kind of a pain when unrolling because it gets stuck to everything. I prefer the dots to the continuous line and would opt for that next time."
4,For Fans of Adams,"While this book would probably not be terribly interesting to someone who has never read any of the other books by the late great Douglas Adams, if you're a fan then you'll love this. Be aware, however, that it is NOT a novel. While it does contain nine chapters from the book he was working on when he died, the majority of the book is excerpts from various interviews, articles, and speeches that he made. Even in these short works his humor and intelligence shine through and you may just find yourself laughing embarressingly loudly if you read it in public."
3,"We miss you, Douglas!","I love all of Douglas Adams's works and my life would never be complete without reading The Salmon of Doubt. Admittedly a couple of parts are less than scintillating---which is to be expected when this book was put together with unfinished, unpolished material. However, it is worth reading for the incomplete Dirk Gently novel alone. What a wonderfully upbeat piece that promised to be. (Is it too much to hope that any of Douglas's friends or colleagues could attempt to finish it for us?) And, my real point in writing this review: Did anyone else get the feeling that the ginger-haired actor Dirk was randomly trailing might be Ford Prefect?"
3,"Not a novel, best for true fans of Douglas Adams","I purchased the ""Salmon of Doubt"" thinking it would be an incomplete novel in line with the other ""hitchikers"" books. The book is not an incomplete novel, although there are some pieces of novels within it. Rather, the majority of the book is a collection of articles, speeches and other musings from Adams. While these are interesting they are not consistent with the ""advertising""If you are a big Douglas Adams fan and are really interested in his ideas, thoughts and views, then buy the book and you will enjoy it. If you are a casual fan, or a fan of the HHGTG or Dirk Gently, then skip this work or wait for it on paperback.As you probably know, Douglas Adams died suddenly and certainly too early for someone of his character. This book is more of a memorial than an unfinished novel that will only appeal to people who are deeply interested in getting to know him better."
5,A Farewell to Douglas Adams,"This book contains letters, essays, a short story, and a few chapters of a Dirk Gently novel. For those who were shocked by Adams' abrupt death, reading the book gives a little bit of closure and allows you to see little slices of his life and the things he was working on just before his death. A must for any true Adams fan."
4,The Salmon of Doubt,"not a story by Adams, but a compendium of his speeches, short bits for magazines, and other things he has written or said, that give the reader a sense of the man. It is enjoyable reading."
4,Entertaining and thoughtful,"The world lost a unique thinker when Douglas Adams passed away. ""The Salmon of Doubt,"" which is made up of essays, unfinished musings and pieces of his final novel, is a mixed bag -- the novel, in particular, has some brilliant portions but obviously would have been extensively rewritten -- but what comes through is both Adams' humor and his rigorous, exciting intellect. One wonders what he would have made of the last decade. Jovially perplexed, is my guess."
5,Last Chance to Read...,"Adams was a brilliant writer whose voice was silenced too soon. With _The Salmon of Doubt_, we are given a work in progress so don't expect a final ""novel"". Part of the book contains the chapters and notes he was working on for a new Hitchhiker's novel (although he was writing it as a Dirk Gently novel (go figure)), The rest of the book contains unrelated articles and story sketches.While this may seem a strange way to sell a book, these highly enjoyable scraps underscore Adams' amazing ability to observe the world, twist it around and show us reality through the lens of fantasy.If you have read any of Adams' work, then this book will not disappoint. If you are new to Adams, then the articles presented in the book offer a great introduction."
5,"Douglas, you simply cannot be dead!...","A man who really knew where his towel was. When the world lost Douglas Adams in a gym in Santa Barbara, it lost one of its most incisive wits and piercingly brilliant ""life"" commentators. This collection of eulogies, articles, introductions, interviews and stories gives a glimpse of Douglas Adams at work and play. Though other friends of Douglas lend their voices to this book, Simon Jones takes the lions share of the work. Simon, for those who don't know, is the original Arthur Dent from the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy radio series and movie. I never met Douglas, but Zarquon's Knees!, I miss him. Buy the CD's, The Salmon of doubt is... ...well, it's better than Vogon poetry!"
3,Posthumous compilation of Adams's work.,"Summary:There isn't really much to summarize here. The book is a collection of magazine articles, letters, and first drafts of stories for future books by Douglas Adams. It also contains a biography and some extensive contributions by Adams's editor and several fans.My Comments:As much as I love Douglas Adams' work, I'm just not so big of a fan that I want every scrap of writing he has ever written. Some of the stuff in the book is fun and interesting and I must admit that it is nice to see a bit more of the preservationist side of Adams rather than just the humor. But, this book is really more of a compilation of dissimilar material for the extreme Adams fan. If you absolutely have to have everything that Adams ever wrote, you'll probably want this book. If you are more interested in Adams's novels you may not find this quite so interesting."
1,If You Love Douglas Adams Avoid this Book,"Douglas Adams is a brilliant writer with books that are well-crafted, wise and thoughtful despite their chaotic humor. This collection of random thoughts found on his hard drive, should have been left where they were found. Mr. Adams would be appalled to see them in print without his careful crafting and without context as a finished work. If you enjoy the works of Douglas Adams you will be sorely disappointed by this collection of errata, unless of course, you also like reading errata sheets."
2,"Small Fry, throw it back",Adams deconstruction of the little black box joke on page 123 applies to this book as a whole. There are few small glimmers of Grand Fishhood but this salmon is just not worth the bait on the hook. Those die hard Adams fans will surely buy it but then again they would buy a book of compiled Adam's shopping lists.
2,I've been a huge Douglas Adams fan for a long time...,"but this book just didn't quite deliver. Sure there are some funny moments, but as has been mentioned, it's just not something that Douglas was probably ready to have published. I would have loved to have been able to read another Hitchhiker book, or especially another Dirk Gently book, but in it's unfinished form, it's just not what Douglas would have wanted it to be. Not to mention that it was tiring hearing so much about Adams' atheistic beliefs. I read Adams' books for their humor, not to be preached at about atheism, although some of his atheistic statements actually were better support for theism, which was obviously completely unintentional by Adams."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"If you want to read more of the story you will be so disappointed by this book. If you want to read random crap from the author then this book is for you.Save your money. Invest your time in something productive, like clipping your toenails or watching grass grow."
2,Only for collectors,"If you're looking to collect all Dug's books, then go for it. But don't expect much."
3,"Not one of his better books, but still worth while","Anyone who has read Douglas Adams knows that nothing is off limits in his books. Adams has his opinions and is not afaird to share them, which is what makes his book so enjoyable. He takes readers places most other authors do not dream of going, and he does it while giving you many laughs.However this book is not like many of his books, and perhaps that is because it is reallly a collection of several books. The first sections Adams sounds off on various issues, and like him or not, disagree with him or not, you have to respect someone who says what the feel regardless of what others may think. The novel portion of the book is very good, and I was really interested in the storylines and how the charcters evolved.If you enjoy his sci-fi novels but do not prefer reading political views or arguments, than stick with the Hitchhikers Guide. Read this book if you want to read about who Adams was."
4,The Original is still better than any book.,"As a fellow fan of HHGG, allow me to share with you my copy of ALL 12 of the Original BBC series broadcasts from 1980 in an MP3 format. The original audio is even better than the book. (Zephod's heads are in stereo.) I have posted the 30 minute episodes on my Hotmail Skydrive space at:[...]Enjoy!"
5,"I Absolutely, Positively Loved It!",I thought this book was wonderful! It has a ton of info abou Serena Tsukino. It had beautiful pictures of her transformations and attacks. I let my friends read it and they said they loved it. I also have the Mars Scout Guide. I think they are both great. I am getting the rest of the Scout Guides. This book is a must-have for any SM(Sailor Moon)fan!
4,"Good guide, not great.","Usagi is my favorite SM character, I wish I could have a girl-friend just like her. Anyway, this is a good guide... but if you're like me and you know *lots* about Usagi... this will be useless. But, never you mind that! It's an awesome book, make sure to buy it. It's worth the cash."
3,Awesome,This was a cute book I got for my daughter who Iv gotten into this anime. The only downside to the book is it covers only the American version and so it doesn't have the complete story line
2,Disappointing :(,"I'm a huge Sailormoon fan and this book is not useful for anything but a collectible item. Anyone who watches the tv show on a regular basis already knows this stuff, and it's such a tiny, tiny book for such a big price (with shipping, it's nearly 20!). This is definitely for hardcore collectors only."
5,moon freak,"let me get this strait Mireiko-sama, i dont know why they dont talk about superS but i know whythey dont talk about stars. sailor moon stars the 5th season was neverin engish ,u cant even buy it in engish.also they never dubbed it,and if they did they would have to cut out a lot of stuff.and they would have to change the plot. and let me say this again ''ITS NOT IN ENGISH''"
2,Collectors Wanted,"All I can say is... if you really like Sailor Moon and you're a rabid collector, go right ahead a purchase this book. If not, you'd be better off saving your money for something else. Such as, say, a Fushigi Yugi book!"
1,"Oh, no, not again.","Munkres has apparently forgotten the painful lessons learned in the 1950s and insists on reopening the Range War: does ""range"" mean the image (acceptable), the codomain (BAD idea), or both (total confusion)?As a truly unforgivable sin against the succeeding generations of students, this renders the book UNACCEPTABLE for any purpose other than biofuel."
2,Excellent book,"One of the best books for first course in topology. There issome weakness in the second part, but for the first course of topology this book is great."
5,Simply the best,"This is by far the best undergraduate mathematics textbook I have ever used. I was fortunate enough to have a very good professor for this course and combined with this book was quite possibly the best undergraduate mathematics course I've ever taken. This book is amazing for self study and is truly indispensable. Munkres' explanations are very clear and rigorous at the same time and the problems are very good. Of course, there is no solutions manual which is the only drawback if one is using this text for self study. There really aren't any other options if you want to learn topology for the first time. The book has a nice introduction to set theory then it covers point set topology and algebraic topology. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn topology. I sure had a lot of fun reading through this book!"
5,"Awsome text, bad binding","This book is extremely well written; a great place to start learning topology. Unfortunately, the publisher has not given it the binding it deserves. Look, an [expensive] hardbound book deserves a nice binding (with so-called ""signatures,"" for instance), not a paperback glue binding that begins losing pages within weeks of gentle use. I took mine to a book repairman at my university library, who took one look at the poor thing and shook his head; there was nothing I could do: it was simply a cheap binding."
5,came in good condition,"book was in great condition when i recieved it. i was worried that i would not get the book before my class started but that was my fault for ordering too late, it was shipped within the time frame that was posted."
5,great!,"Not much to add here... there are enough easy problems that I can get the hang of something, but also some really tough ones at the end of each problem section. The proofs and examples in the text are really good guides to doing the problems also. In some sections there are counterexamples for, say, the converse of a theorem which are always really pathological. At the beginning of each section there is some discussion on what to expect, why the stuff is important, what to do with it, etc. Even though I had a really good prof for the topology course I did this book was very helpful out of the classroom."
5,A Great Work,"Taking a first course in topology could not be better complemented. This clear exposition of point set and algebraic topology is so well written that it could even be used for self study. Motivation from the professor is always helpful, but Munkres actually goes quite far in providing a reason for the topics in question. Furthermore, the examples clarify many of the presented concepts and even show some of the misconceptions a student may have.Having a course in analysis would certainly make the book flow since otherwise it would just to be a mental exercise rather than an extension of familiar concepts.The exercises are very well thought out and are meant to be solved by all students given that they have some diligence. They truly help in turning a fog of concepts into concrete understanding."
4,PHENOMENAL!!!,This book by Munkres makes the world of topology accessible to those who are either not topologists or are just beginning their careers in topology. He starts this book from the ABSOLUTE beginning with discussions on elementary logic and set theory. From there he develops basic point set topology and then takes the reader into algebraic topology. This work is lucid and very well planned. The only reason I did not rate it five stars is because I believe any text always has room for improvement. If you need a well written and clearly understandable book on the field of topology this is the one that you want.
3,"Protective, but a tad small","I purchased this screen protector for my Canon EOS XS (1000D), which, if you have one of these, you know how your nose hits the LCD screen and leaves it all oily when you use the eyepiece/view finder on the camera. While the protector covers most of the screen, if you mount the protector flush at the top and flush at the left, there is about 1.5mm to 2mm of the LCD screen that is not covered at the right edge and about 1mm not covered at the bottom edge. Not a deal-breaker, but, seems like they could get it more accurate than that since the precise size of the LCD screen is surely known and stable!"
2,Oh come on!,"I give this book two stars simply because Mr. Oates is a rather entertaining fellow. If you read this book you probably will enjoy it. But as for the theories that Oates is attempting to introduce us to, all I have to say is...""Oh come on!""Yes, folks, if we record our speech and play it backwards, hidden messages will be heard. These hidden messages are the ""ultimate lie detector!"" While we may lie in our normal speech, we never lie in our reverse speech.To which I once again say ""Oh, come on!""(Now, if you want to know what I really thought of this book, read this message backwards....)"
1,"right down there with psychics, tarot readers and sasquatch","Anyone thinking that Americans are alone in their descent to scientifically illiterate will be assured to know that Australia is now infected. Oates' ""discovery"" is not Reverse Speech, but the well known idea that people are gullible. Most hoaxes, though, are more clever than Reverse Speech..."
5,Excelent,"Excelent animation, great teaser on a story that's unfortunately unavailable in any other language than Polish.Someone please fix this, and publish Jacek Dukaj works in English!"
2,Not for a Man's Hand,"The Sensa pens are great. However, I was replacing a 10 year old Sensa pen and didn't realize this was such a light and short pen. Goldspot provided great customer service though and I finally found the Cosmopolitan Sensa perfect - as did the recipient. The perfect balance of weight, writing and handsome design."
2,Too formless,"While these Jockeys are soft and comfortable, they lack other qualities I think most men want in underwear such as a firm waistband and snug support. To each his own. If you prefer underwear that is just a covering with little support, this may be your new favorite. If you want good, snug, comfortable support, look elsewhere."
2,oxbowmann,"Been wearing Elance biknis for 20+ years. The last I purchased have started to fray at the top, esp at the label. The inside right seam has gotten so large, that they are painful by the end of the day.Cheap is cheap and junk is junk. I have purchased my last pair!Hello, are you listening, Jockey!?"
1,Disappointed,"I am buying same type and size of this underwear for years, this one feels like size smaller, the fabric is nice"
4,Good for your basic bikini briefs,"I would love to see Jockey get into the game of the higher end men's underwear. Make some different cuts, add some room for a pouch to open things up a little... Over all though, these are your basic, good, bikini briefs."
2,True is the stitch that digs,"These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home."
3,Seam from hell,"As others have said, these have a very uncomfortable seam on the right side which leaves a noticeable mark on your skin after wearing them for a few hours, and it's not exactly the greatest feeling. I don't understand how these managed to go through quality control with an issue like this. Other than that, the fit is great and they look very nice on the body. These are cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Not what they used to be,"I used to be a regular user of these briefs, and after years of not buying them ('cause the ones I had never wore out) I bought them again. Unlike the older versions they no longer have that piece of extra material in the front for ... you know. perhaps they were redesigned by some woman who didn't know what it was for."
2,Uncomfortable.,"I bought some of these - I find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable. Other than that they are OK, but because of this I mostly wear these inside out."
1,Not good!,"Worse of what i was expecting, very cheap fabric, i will never buy this men brief ( under wear) again, i didn't like it"
5,Inspirational,I think the books was written beautifully. I think that it gave honest and comforting information. I think it was inspired by God and a mothers son Mike. I think this book will help alot of grieving parents to find peace and some comfort. I find the honestly and inspiration so rewarding. I feel it opens up things that God has given us in a way that is wonderful and this book shows that in many ways. I just loved the book and would recommend it to anyone. Sincerely. Rose Stenrose
1,THANK YOU,"Donna and Dary....I want to say thank you so much for writing ""Childlight""....while reading your book, I found myself crying with the moms, then smiling and feeling the closeness of our children. When I lost my son,Mike, I searched for books to read, support groups, someone to talk to, to help me....It took me 5 years to find that support.....in the MOMs Loop.... Your book is going to touch so many hearts, and help so many moms..... Thank you again from the bottom of my heart..."
5,awesome subject and author,"i have read this book and i was very moved and touched by these stories of great strength and power, and i truly believe !"
1,A sham story,"I doubt that the writer ever lived in the Netherlands. Only one person nemed Dobschiner is on the official list of those who were transported from the Netherlands during WWII and did not come back. The writer mentions four family members who were transported. The imprecise and fairly unreal description of her travels and the invented names (ex: Moeke was only used in cetain parts of the country and not in the cities)defy veracity. Her claim that she went from Amsterdam to Hilversum on the ""Autobahn"" is ridiculous. There was no Autobahn and not even an interstate type highway in those days.I know - I lived there.This book is clearly an attempt to utilize suffering in WWII for promoting a specific religious sect. I recommmend that readers not waste their money on it."
2,The foal dies....this is not like the others in the series,"My 8-year old daughter has read a number of the books in this series and was completely shocked at the ending of this book. She was so sad and could not understand why they wrote the story this way. She said it was not like the rest of the series...they're not supposed to die. I agree completely. At a minimum, I'd expect all the books in a series to have a similar vibe, and this one broke an implicit expectation that the books in this series always have a happy ending."
2,too sad,"Foals in the Field was a very good story that my daughter was enjoying very much until the end. In the end a foal dies suddenly. This is not just a foal, but a character in which the reader developes a significant emotional investment. My daughter, who is very sensitive about animals, and horses in particular, was inconsolable. I cannot recommend this book for children. I don't know what the writer or the publishers were thinking. Will they not be happy until our children require anti-depressants?"
5,Best Cream for Heels,"I felt so strongly about this productat I decided to write my first review.I suffer from extrmely dry heels on otherwise healthy feet. and have tried almost every cream, pumic stone etc on the market. Nothing really worked.I read an article a while back which said that this is the best cream ever, so I ordered it from amazon, but I did not really believe it.But, for once, it really is true."
5,Magic!!!,"I sometimes get cracks in my heels that are so painful. I found this product (cheap, too) and really had doubts. I bought it b/c of it's money-back guarantee. After a couple of days, my heels had improved amazingly!! Here's how I do it: first slough off any crackly peeling skin from your heels with one of those sandpaper foot files. Make sure you do that when your heels are DRY, not damp or wet. Then apply Sally Hansen's ointment all around the affected areas before going to bed, and be sure to put on some socks. You can do this again, during the day, if you wear socks. Do this a few nights, and you'll be amazed at how baby-smooth and soft your heels will become. This stuff is miraculous and lasts a very long time!!! Better than any moisture cream. I love it!"
3,Historical Value - Great Players of Jazz on every Track!,"This CD, that came out in the mid 1990s, was actually the result of several years worth of live performances a a NY Jazz club owned by Doug Duke in the late 1960s. Duke, who was a pretty good organist and keyboard player, made the master tapes when he sat in and jammed with the headliners at the club. Unfortunately, many of the tracks are Hammond Organ-heavy, and one is left wanting much more. Particularly with such legendary performers such as Roy Eldridge, Toots Thielemans, Coleman Hawkins, Lionel Hampton, Charlie Byrd and others. Even so, it's a solid sound, and can be enjoyed by casual jazz fans as well as collectors interested in the historical aspecs of the players' performances."
2,Not for me,"Since this vibrator is hard plastic, it's a one-size only machine. Frankly I can't imagine how it would fit most women, since the opening between the two ends is quite wide...I decided to use that part as a handle! Might as well get smaller item and put it where one wants. It's very attractive as a sculpture, though! And motor is quiet."
1,Not quite what I wanted,This really didnt do anything for me. It think I will try the We-vibe next time.
1,Did not receive it,"Couldn't ever try it, the seller ships with UPS and UPS does'nt deliver to POBoxes which was my address."
1,Better options elsewhere,I bought this Card reader to go in a HTPC I was building. I needed a reader which would fit in a 5.25 inch bay. For that the card reader works - Basically what you are buying is a standard 3.5 inch internal card reader and a larger mounting caddy for the card reader.Sadly the card reader does not work with SDHC Cards such as my 2Gb card. This was confirmed by their tech Support. I've now ditched the card reader and bought a better Rosewill one (for less than $15) which works out of the box.In summary - an expensive caddy for other card readers.
1,Of limited use,"This reader has some limitations.While it worked fine reading picture files created on an SD high capacity card in a Pentax K10 camera, this on a computer running XT Home OS; in a new machine running Vista OS, it would not read the card.It said the card must be reformatted (which the camera could now not read).This conflict was reported to the manufacture's support site, and they acknowledged this flaw. At this time they have no driver update to correct this."
1,Fails to read 2GB SD card on Vista,"The device fails to read my 2GB Kingston SD card on Vista.I know there are some SD card issues on Vista, but the same 2GB SD card reads fine in an i-rocks reader attached to the same system."
4,Country's Family Reunion series not rare,All of the Country Family Reunion series including the DVD and VHS that sellers are advertising as RARE is false. All of the Country's Family Reunion Series are available at [...] who are the producers of the the series. the Opry series is [...] and the Ryman Series is [...] and both can be purchased for [...] NEW !!!! It is not necessary to purchase OLD DVD's or VHS tapes at these prices !!!! The company stands behind their product when it is purchased from them. 800-820-5405
4,Marriage for Dummies,"Male-53-Second marriage-children from both, etc. Wow, I read the book and it all makes sense to me. Men do not need to throw gasoline on the fire or even where a fire could erupt. If men forcus on what they really want from their relationship with their wives - a peaceful homelife with a romantically charged woman, this book provides a path. Are women angels, no. Can men help them fell safe enough to be angelic, yes. Read it - Try it for 30 days. If you do not feel better about your wife and she you, then....."
5,THIS ONE made a difference,"We have read SO many books on relationships, mostly Christian books. This one, while written by a secular psychologist, has some biblical parallels and a LOT of wisdom. Alter's writing style is fun and engaging. I bought it to read, my husband stole it from me. We've bought several copies to give away. It's a GREAT book."
1,Piss Poor item & Piss Poor service,"I ordered this hat for my wife's birthday, or so I thought. We ended up getting a TOTALLY different hat, in silver colour.When we tried to complain &/or get a refund or new hat we heard the square route of Sweet Fanny Adams. No apology, nothing, na da.I know that the hat was not sold directly from Amazon, but by the hat manufacturer. All I can say is ""DON'T BUY A HAT FROM THIS COMPANY."" All that will happen is that you loose your hard earned money. I am giving it zero stars, for obvious reasons.J. Brooke"
4,:),Exactly what I was looking for! The fit was perfect! One of my favorite hats i have purchased! Fast shipping and excellent quality.
5,Good Hat,I purchased this hat for a sweet 16 party my daughter was throwing (western theme). The quality for the price was very good; I was impressed with the designs on the hat. It has a good fit to it.
5,ehats,"Wow.That word describes everything, love the product amazing deal.I would recommend EHATS to anybody."
1,A book for specialists,"More than a book it is a collection of papers, not always easy to understand and written in academic language. It could be used as a reference by one who knows already the subject. Not recommended for beginners"
4,Great collection but not for computer,This is a great compilation of VeggieTales songs. At the time this was the only place to get the Bellybutton song. It's a great sample of all the different types of CDs VeggieTales puts out.My own complaint (for 4 of 5 stars) is that it won't play on my mac! It immediately ejects it. All other VeggieTales CDs play on computers. It won't play on my parents' PC either. kinda sad. no iPod for these songs...
3,The Early Touch of Kostelantez,The music is excellent but the product review fails to mention that the tracks are from 1937-46 and are neither high fidelity or stereo.
3,Disappointing - doesn't live up to the publicity,"I was disappointed by this book. Most of the space is taken up by a listing of the Swing class types and parameters. Whilst the annotation is useful, and the book is distinctive in it's reference style, the information is too focussed on a method by method rather than ""how do I do this?"" types of questions.If you already have David Geary's Swing book and the O'Reilly book, this adds a small value but get those titles first."
4,Useful for quick reference,"Though this book is not nearly as useful as other Swing books when it comes to learning hoiw things work. It is organized so nicely that referencing things is often faster than it is in the online docs. Not my favorite book, but well done and original. I recommend it only for veterans. Also its the only book that covers all of the Basic PLAF (I would have given it 3 stars if it didn't have this)."
2,Stupid Hero = poor plot,"I'm one of those people that HAS to finish a book -- good, bad, or otherwise. This one barely got finished -- I don't see what the positive reviewers saw in this book. The main character was STUPID, no suspense regarding ""why"" he is targeted -- author just tells the reader within the first few chapters. Why not let the reader discover the reason along with the main character? The middle chapters are just biding time until the denoument ... reader is better off reading a few at the beginning and then a few at the end -- nothing much happens in the middle. PLEASE authors, give your readers some credit, we are smarter than you give us credit ... the ""surprise"" ending was no surprise. Only reason I went with 2 stars vs. 1 is that I did finish it... the ones I can't even finsh get the 1-star."
4,A Suspenseful Tale of Mystery and Murder,"We all make bad decisions, some worse than others. Josh Michaels, the protagonist of Accidents Waiting to Happen has strayed from the straight and narrow once too often and now karma is crashing down around him.It all starts when Josh is run off the road into a river and left to drown. The police put it down as an accident. Josh knows it was intentional yet cannot understand why anyone would want to kill him. More supposed accidents follow in close order and soon Josh is literally fighting for his life and his family.Set in and around Sacramento, California, Accidents Waiting to Happen is quick paced and skillfully told. While there are times when the reader may shout at Josh, ""Are you crazy? Do not do that!"" it's only because we've become part of his world and are rooting for him to find a way out of the ever-deepening spiral of trouble in which he has been caught."
4,A True Page Turner,"So much for sleep.Simon Wood's, Accident's Waiting to Happen starts fast and keeps the pace until the very last page.We learn that the main character is paying for some poor decisions he made years before when financial problems forced him to take out a unique insurance policy. The policy puts a premium on his head and he has to work hard to avoid someone collecting that premium.After reading this book, I've read every book he's written.They all keep me up at night as I'm forced to keep turning the page until the very end. Certainly a recommended read."
2,Accidents waiting to happen,I chose this book I love mysteriesBut this one was not as good as l thought it would be
2,Don't Bother,"if this was a movie I was watching on a weekend afternoon i would rather watch the weather channel.Felt like there was nothing original going on. Just somewhat rearranged parts from other stories.Cliche unbelievable unremarkable characters made of such thin cardboard you wish someone would douse them in water so that they would dissolve and wash away into the gutter.Not a complete waste, but better stuff easily found."
3,"Great storyline, Poor editing","Simon Wood has a terrific imagination. The plot is excellent and kept me guessing, although the denouement is expected once the climax begins. I kept thinking that this was made for the big screen. Unfortunately, it reads more like a script than a novel, and there are numerous textual errors and typos that should have been caught by the editor. With a better editor, Simon Wood could have a promising career as a novelist."
2,Lead character?,"It's very hard to get involved with a book when the main character is a complete jerk. The man deserves everything that happens to him. Unfortunately, innocents suffer because of his actions. It is extremely difficult to root for a character like that. Because of this, it is a difficult read."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","The premise of the novel is a good one and very imaginative. The main character, however, is utterly unlikable, a crook who cheats on his wife while whining that his life will be over if he loses her. He's the only character you get to know in this book, and who cares what happens to him? This book also suffers from poor editing with many typos and textual errors."
1,Overpriced at 99 cents,"It's hard to figure out what's worse in this book - the lame plot line, the poor character development or the horrible dialog. There was certainly the potential for a good story here, and I'm willing to suspend belief to some extent for a good thriller, but Simon Wood fails on all accounts. The writing is high school level, at best. I rarely write reviews, but this was so bad I felt I had to counter good reviews it's received."
2,Dreck,This is poorly written and poorly edited/ proofread. It is so poor a novel that I made a special category just for it: DRECK. I wanted to remember to NOT ORDER another book by this author.
5,Great Read,I read this book by accident (no pun intended). Mr. Wood's writing style is excellent. You actually feel for Josh in this book. Don't start this book on a Sunday night; you will late for work om Monday.
2,Uninspiring,The writing and the initial character and plot development ofAccidents Waiting to Happenwere so mundane that I gave up after reaching my typical 17% go/no-go decision point.
5,makes you think twice,"this one is in my ""Food for Thought"" list. Makes you think twice about insurance companies - whom I do not trust from the get go - - sort of scary AND believable"
2,Please kill him!,"Got fooled by good reviews. Glad it was only 99 cents. The main character is so annoying, that I was rooting for his death. There are some good parts...but with no one to root for, it was hard to finish the book."
1,Writing for morons!,"How this book warrants over four stars I'll never know. The dialogue, plot and character development are pathetic. This book is a complete waste of money and time."
2,Disappointing.,Who gives this 5 stars I dont understand. Too much drama and coincidences to be interesting. A little less would have made a better story...and main character was whining about his bad choices too much to like the guy.
1,Don't Believe 5 star reviews,"Not being able to finish a Kindle Book is becoming tedious. You certainly get what you pay for. Ninety nine cents isn't much. What it buys, from my recent experience, isn't even worth that. ""Accidents Waiting to Happen"" is unreadable in my opinion. Dreadfully predictable, boring, and plainly a waste of even five cents in my opinion. I am heading back to my local library to find a book worth reading that won't cost me $14.00 to $20.00."
1,I actually feel conned!,Appalling.I bought the book on the basis of the strong reviews... but this book is so bad that there is no way people could have rated it so highly. There has clearly been some manipulation of the review process. I am angry at myself for falling for it.
1,Absolutely Aweful,"If I could I'd give it zero stars. It takes the author forever to develope a plot so simplistic a second grader could figure it out. Which is funny since the main character is so miopic, self absorbed, and unlikeable that he doesn't figure it out at all. A waste of .99 and your time. I have no idea what all those great reviews are about, but it's the last time I buy a book based on reviews."
1,"Writing so bad it's... well, bad.",This novel is a test. Read the sample. If you can tell the writing is high school quality you pass. I passed.
4,It is exciting!,"Accidents Waiting to Happen begins with a car run off the road and into a river. Josh Michaels, though he cannot swim, manages to escape and struggle to shore. The really chilling aspect of this, is that as he struggles the man responsible watches from the bridge, giving Josh a thumbs down in the manner of a Roman emperor ordering the death of a gladiator. As Josh experiences close call after close call, he realizes someone is out to get him. He recognizes the man from the bridge, but when he tries to locate him, finds no one by that name exists. There are some pretty bizarre turns in this novel, and, on several occasions, I found it difficult to suspend belief enough to stay with the story. Characters do not always react in the manner of people I've known. However, the excitement and rapid advancement of the plot, including a killer showdown near the end, kept me hooked."
3,Tough read,"I had trouble with this book. The exposition of many scenes was excruciatingly detailed to little effect. The author used many words to say very little. There wasn't a sympathetic character in the entire book and that includes Abby, the 8 year old. At 40% in I started speed reading just to get a resolution. My reaction was: ""Yeah,right."" I've read other titles by Wood and was very satisfied. This one was a clunker."
3,Writing better than the plot.,"The premise of the book was intriguing ... but I found the book didn't entirely deliver. I liked the writing better than I liked the book. Wood very cleverly weaves the plot and has you wondering just what is happening? But the ending was too unbelievable. I will continue to read Simon Wood, I hope he marries his writing to more complete stories."
2,My first Simon Wood novel.....,"....and my last.Reading the description of the book before ordering it and based on Wood's past writing creditials, I expected a pretty good novel.It started out well enough, went down hill quickly, and left me disappointed.The writing overall to me was low-caliber, the characters not people I wanted to get to know, and the dialogue a bit simple.Apparently it was Wood's debut book, which might explain it, but shouldn't. It is seemingly being republished in 2012, leading one to think it must have been a pretty good seller, but it was just not for me.It was an easy read....but also an unfilling read. Not recommended if you like a really good book and who doesn't?"
5,gripping thriller,"This book came highly reccomended. As I got into the book, I found that I couldn't put it down. It was very well written and the story was very gripping. I am very excited to see what books follow from Mr. Wood."
1,NOT worthy of the glowing reviews,"Like many others I was fooled by the high ratings this book had received. I was able to finish the book, but it was a struggle. It wasn't completely awful, but not that great either. The main character was so unlikeable that it really ruined the book. The writing was amateurish and word choices were very poor. Just as an example: the main character ""sneers"" when he gets blood on him when in the context of the story it is clear that he is repulsed by it. Normally I would give this book 2 or 3 stars, but with the unexplainable amount of high ratings, I wanted to try and give potential future readers a more accurate reflection of the book's quality."
2,insipid and predictable,dont be seduced by a .99 cent book. better to pay more and not be lulled by something that suckers others less erudite
1,embarassed,I am embarassed to have ordered/read (wasn't able to finish it) this. What a complete waste of time. I paid $.99 and feel entitled to a 50 cent refund. Horribly written.
1,An AWFUL book,"I forced myself to read 70% of this book before I just couldn't make myself go on anymore. The characters are all shallow and unreal as is the story. I would give this zero stars, actually."
4,Excellent Series,"A very good read. Slowly draws you into the mystery and the lives of the characters. Recommended by a friend, I truly enjoyed this book and all the other books by this author. I'm now waiting, nearly breathlessly, for the publication, Spring 2011, of the next book. Do yourself a favor, start at the beginning of the series and read your way through. Watch the characters grow and feel yourself become involved in that growth. And, then, there's the mysteries ..."
2,No Match for Author's First Novel,"Although I found the gay-bashing theme at first compelling and sympathetic, as I got further into the story the plot took off at the expense of further character development. Clare as a priest who is the pastor of a church faded into the background, getting only superficial attention.By the end I was exhausted, trying to keep up with the galloping plot. Two irritable details about the Chief, Russ, had me saying out loud to the author, ""Please don't mention Russ adjusting his glasses again, and please don't have him saying for the upteenth time, ""Excuse my French.""A good idea for a plot, but more character development and slower pacing would help a lot."
3,Turning the Page,"Good story. A priest and a lawman artfully thrown together against the backdrop of crime in small town America. Engaging though the tale, a pageturner its not. The e-format of this edition is so clumsy that the slow-turning pages are a true barrier to their enjoyment."
3,fair,"Enjoyed the read but it was really the same basic story told over again. good writing style, flowed well. I just wasn't as ""into"" this one as I had been others."
5,Looking forward to a good read,I've not read books by this author before but am looking forward to enjoying this one. The reviews sound great! And I love a good mystery!
4,Better than Bleak; Great Characters,"Julia Spencer-Fleming hooked me with In the Bleak Midwinter because I enjoyed her protagonist, the Rev. Clare Ferguson. I found Fountain an even better read, with well drawn characters. The romantic tension is nicely balanced, never impeding plot movement nor oversimplifying human emotion. The plot itself left something to be desired but I don't read Spencer-Fleming for plot; she has other gifts to offer."
4,Another Great Read,Another great read in the Clare Fergusson mystery series. The characters are always fun and the mystery is always interesting.
2,Fountain Filled with Disappointment,"Deeply disappointing; the mystery was almost an afterthought, with romance - and a rather trite one, at that - taking center stage. The climax strained credulity to its limits, then pressed on a bit further. And Clare has the least demanding (work-related) schedule of any spiritual leader I've encountered! Too bad; there were some passages that were well-written; would that those had proven more numerous, and the ideas within them more thoroughly explored/developed."
4,A review,Found the book good reading. Was excellent on Kindle for our recent trip. WOuld enjoy more by the same author.
4,Good read,"I raced through this second book, right after reading the first. It's a good follow-up and compelling.The ""gay"" angle got lost in the plot and I never did find who organized the first two attacks. The relationship between Russ and Clare is building, so I will read more books to find out where. But well worth the investment."
3,This rain fly is not for the MTX DXP & EXP trunk bags!!!...,"I made the mistake of reading the description wrong when I bought this product. It's not for the full size MTX Trunk Bags. This is for the smaller verison. I did find the MTX DXP ""Silver"" full size rain fly and it fits perfect.Topeak MTX Trunk Bag EXP & DXP Bicycle Trunk Bag Rain Cover"
1,Are you serious?,"I commute alot so getting a rain cover was great. So when I got it and tried to put it on, I was very disappointed. The picture is very misleading. It looks to be a perfect fit, but hardly the story. The cover might be able to fit over a purse or book bag, but not your typical trunk bag. Would not recommend this to anyone, complete waist of money and time."
5,Excellent Leather Treatment,"Tanner's oil is awesome for making stiff leather supple. This is also a wonderful cleaner as well. You will love having this in your home, or car if you have leather seats. Prevents cracking as it keeps the leather moisturized for long term loving and TLC."
1,Just plain creepy,"This never gets off of the ground and I really was turned offby it. Remember those seedy books without illustrated covers that hadpretensions of being more than adult sex novels because they threw in a little plot? Well, this is the same thing for the late '90's. The characters were so wooden and sterotypes - if mannequins could be gay, that is."
5,Great product,"The shipment came quickly and was in perfect condition. My son is loving it and it will come in handy during those long practices in the summer band camp. I would highly recomend this pad for tenor players, especially if its their first year."
4,BUY THIS!,"For Heaven's sakes, go out and get this record. It contains some of the most beautiful melodies I've ever heard. Isn't that enough? If you need more, O.K, it doesn't have a duff track, it beats almost everything DMST have committed to record before apart from maybe the last track of ""Goodby Enemy Airship.."" and it will not have you thinking ""another dull post-rock album"". I only give it four stars because the artwork isn't as appealing as usual, but i'm not complaining."
5,This is very good!,"I actually dont have this albumn yet but i listened to the whole thing in the record store coz i blasted all my money on [another singer].AND I WISH I HAD SPENT MY MONEY ON THIS.The songs seem instantly likeable.Less soundscapes just really good tunes. The old do make say think is still there but i guess theyve just become more accessible.Which is so not a bad thing, because accessible usually means good.Less raw than landlord, but it still has the lounge feel of self titled. The melodies just suck you in and send you into a trance letting you create a film in your head with the best soundtrack..."
3,Bright low in excellent discography,"3 1/2This transitional album of sorts for the great instrumental group finds them at a crossroads between the eccentric jams of old and more recent compositional ambitions. As a result, &Y;&Y; can sound a little over-thought at times, but still has plenty of engaging musical insights on display."
5,Laughed til I cried,"I saw this book and knew I had to read it. This guy is hilarious. It's like going to bar-b-que and talking to funniest guy there over beers. The book is fast paced, fun, interesting and moving. Even if you don't like basketball, you will be delightfully entertained."
1,If this guy wasn't 7 feet tall....,"....he'd be flipping burgers. Like Charles Barkley (who -- big surprise -- is one of his best buddies), Jayson Williams is a self-important blowhard who uses his status as a minor celebrity as a platform to dispense his childish anecdotes and mind-numbing personal opinions. Here's an example of his brilliant insight: if you turn out the lights, any woman can be Cindy Crawford. Wow! Thanks for the tip, Jayson!"
1,Loose Author ----- Nothing of Interest,"I decided to read this book, just to find out what Jayson Williams had to say. My final answer -- ""Nothing of interest."" He spent too much time talking about how much money he is making, yada, yada and nothing about how much he has contributed to the game,or the team. At times his writing sounds so egotistical. This man is a major basketball star who hasn't played for his team in two complete seasons. I quess this book was his way of filling up his time. For those of you expecting to get some inside look at the ""Nets"" don't waste your time reading this book. Lucky for me, I borrowed it from the library, so I didn't loose any money purchasing this book."
4,"A fun, light read for any basketball fan","I think most any NBA fan or casual follower will find this book entertaining. And it's certainly interesting now, given the trouble Jayson's in for some of the same kind of wild behavior he talks about in the book. It's hard to think of him as anything other than a fun loving guy who (allegedly) caused a horrible accident through wreckless actions. In the book he talks about partying at his home so no one gets in trouble or fights.The anecdotes in the book are usually funny and offer a close and lighthearted insight into a lot of things big time basketball players encounter. My instinct is that there's a lot of exaggeration in the stories, but I suspect they're generally true. Jay comes across as a good guy, as you'd expect, and he seems to be genuinely thankful for his family and his talent. It's hard to not like him and it's easy to enjoy this book. Not great literature by any means, but a fun, light read."
3,"The lighter, funnier side of the NBA 3.5 stars","Jayson Williams is one funny guy. His book Loose balls: is no Ball four, but it definetely is funny and he has some funny and thoughtful insights into the NBA of today. This is done in his humorous fashion. Jayson Williams is a real personality who is not only willing to laugh at the NBA and it's players but also at himself. I like the fact that he doesn't take things too seriously and try to stuff his ideas down you throat. What I also appreciated was his honesty and sincerety something sorely lacking in a lot of todays atheletes. A funny read."
3,a little slow and self promoting,"I know of jaysons story before i read the book, its a shame, the book while funny is a little sad it shows a man with such a god given talent that still doies not have friends just hanges on.. some enjoyment but not the best sports book i have read"
3,ok,"I read Loose Balls because i'm a big basketball fan, and also a Jayson Williams fan, but I didn't like it like I throught I would. After reading the book I found him to be kinda of arrogant, and a know it all. At one point he really started to bug me, like the part where he assume that the athletes who come to the NBA early to help their families are just lying and ready to get money, how do he know what their situation are, some of those guys might need to help out their familiess. I want even get into the part what he said when his team have to play Southern teams. I actually liked Dennis Rodman's two better than this one."
2,Good graphics bad gameplay,"I bought this game yesterday i thought it was gonna be better but it really dissapoint me a lot. the graphigs are excellent the game modes too. But it dissapoint me, the game play. It is very terrible, it feels like you dont have the players controls. when you order your player to move in certain direction, it takes about 2 seconds(sometimes more) to move in that direction.This really dissapoint me.The game feels very slow. Thats really sucks.You can not create your own team.Those two stars are only for the graphics. I hope the ea do a better job next year. I think that winning eleven is better than this game.."
1,Not worth it at all,"I own 2003 and 2002 and this is a disgrace for a good line of soccer games. The menu is horrid, the gameplay is so slow and way to complex to be any fun. Not very supportive of hardware and had to go to alot of trouble to get it to work. Does not work in DVD drives. No controller custom config. This game is so crapy I would not recomend it to anyone, and im considering writing EA because they usually put out a good product. Waste of 20 bucks"
2,Not interesting or fun anymore,"This game got much worse with time. When i played fifa 1996 it was really exacting and fun to play. I haven't played fifa soccer for 8 years. I bought this game thinking it would be better then the one I played 8 years ago turns out it got much worse .Bad game play, bad graphics, a lot of international teams like Japan and north korea are missing. I didn't get into the game at all."
1,Very bad soccer game.,"It looks a lot like fifa 2003, of course with some improvements but still the gameplay is not realistic. Graphics look good, players look real but its all useless because you can't play soccer as it is meant to be played, headers suck, the goalkeepers are robots stuck in the goal line. There is too many things to criticize but only to make things short, if you want a soccer game that makes you jump off your seat whenever you score or miss a goal, buy winning eleven, it is by far much more attractive due to its gameplay."
2,What??!!!,"This is outrageous, the MLS over the argentinian, peruvian and colombian leagues, that is a disgrace, the people who crated the game obviously don't keep up with football and don't use common sense for the game, like giving a pass to nowhere when the player is right there, and why aren't there any skill moves, they exist you know? may not in the US but in the rest of the world, why not check it out from time to time..."
1,Horrible game,"There are many reasons why this game deserves a 1 star. The only reason why I did give this game a 1 star is because it has player names and a numbr of leagues. The graphics are weak, stats do not compare to other EA titles like Madden. Control of the players could have been better."
4,cool but too irrealistic,"EA Sports ave donne a good job in making this really addictive game but the goals are sometimes much too irrealistic as you can score from yards away from the goal + some players are much better than there real capacities(ex:P.Kluivert who isn't a wicked player is, in this game, nearly as good if not better than Henry or Zidane or Beck's).Also the refereeing is unfair as there's a foul when there shouldn't and sometimes there isn't when there should + youre team gets much more red cards than the others.Otherwise it is very good with a lot of options and competitions.The graphics are fantastic and the sound of nthe crowd and of the game makes you really feel in it ,playing."
2,disapointment,"My first Fifa game was FIFA 96, and, every 2 years, I buy another. After seeing FIFA 2003 at a friend's house, I was really looking forward to the 2004's issue. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!The game is really slow; you almost have to shout for them to run; it keeps crashing during the match; the menus are some of the most confusing and useless I've ever experienced... Well, I hope EA Sports learns a lesson and puts the level of excitment (which was present on the others) back on the game, especially during the match: too slow, too complicated, not worth it.The only good point are the new leagues."
3,Great step forward after FIFA 2003,"What can I say about FIFA Soccer 2004? If you like FIFA series from EA Sports, you will praise this game without doubt. If you like PES/ISS/WE series from Konami, you will blame this game. I agree with previous review - don't listen Ian. In comparison with FIFA 2003 EA made great job this year. Do not pay attention to some minor bugs, which exist in all FIFA Soccer games, and enjoy this game!"
3,Great step forward after plain FIFA 2003,"What can I say about FIFA 2004? If you are fan of FIFA series from EA Sports, you will praise this game without doubt. If you are fan of PES/WE/ISS series from Konami, you will blame this game. Thus don't worry about insignificant bugs, which always exist in FIFA Soccer, and enjoy this game! And do not forget to look at my rating of this game to know my real opinion about it."
5,Workout tape,I teach water aerobics.Everyone enjoys this music.It has fast and slow.The slow comes at just the right time for stretching and the fast is good for the aerobic workout we need.
3,it is ok,"it is a nice idea for a letters however they toys attached can be tared easly ,baby loose intrest fast."
3,french review,The french in this package and the method of teaching is very good if you already know french and are seeking a review. The words and phrases I have never heard are difficult to learn because it is difficult to visualize. The woman has a very good accent but the man speaks too fast and is very difficult to understand due to his poor accent. The CD quality is poor and has a difficult time working in my CD player. This is not a problem for any other CD. I would say this is just an average product.
5,Excellent Brush Up CDs,"I took French in High School and college... but that was (gulp) decades ago! Wanted to brush up before my first trip to France. These CDs were the perfect method. Rebuilt my vocabularly, tweaked my pronunciation, updated my idioms, and reminded me of grammar... but best of all, built my confidence to speak French with the French. Really excellent (and I received many compliments from Parisians (!) on my French!"
4,Excellent If The Book Is Used Heavily,"After struggling to retain anything using the Rosetta Stone, I decided to purchase ""Behind the Wheel"". I easily uploaded the cds onto my computer and transferred them over to my IPod shuffle so that I could listen to them while I was working around the house or at work. I have to admit that I found the workbook that came with the cds much more effective than the cds themselves. The audio does not delve deep enough into the language to get a grasp at it. Before I started ""Behind the Wheel"", I only had a basic knowledge of French. Now, I am almost through chapter 4 in the book, and feeling much more confidant of my speaking and listening abilities. My fiance is a French citizen, and I am trying to work towards fluency so that I can communicate with my new extended family! I feel that ""Behind the Wheel French"" has been a wonderful springboard toward my goal."
5,"""Behind the Wheel French"" with the companion book ""Language Dynamics French"" is all you need to get started.","The ""Behind The Wheel French"" system is great, but make sure you buy the 2006 edition of ""Behind the Wheel French 1 Revised/Complete Illustrated Text & CD Script/Answer Keys/8 One Hour Audio CDs (Audio CD)"". See the review of this 2006 set by J. Rhoda ""Amazon lover"" (Beantown MA.It's the combination of the CDs with the book that really works. I tried Pimsleur, which is very limited and comparatively expensive."
2,beginning french,it moved along too fast...I bought Learn to Speak French Deluxe from the Learning Company...and that one is more my speed.
3,Review of Behind the Wheel French,"I'm still working with this. I think it would be tough for someone who had never taken French before to learn from a CD. That's not really the CD's fault though, just the fact that sometimes you need to read the French words to be able to pronounce or understand the words correctly. I did take a bunch of French though so it's a great refresher. It's fairly painless doing it on the way to work and back. erhaps my brain is slow, but it would be nice to have a bit more time to think of the answer when the teacher asks you how to say something you've gone over."
4,excellent for the price.,"For the money, this is a terrific value. I have the Pimsleur French course as well, and find it a little better for making things stick in your memmory, but the cost is considerably more."
5,A Great Way to Learn a Langauge!,"I must say that ""Behind the Wheel French"" is definitely a great way to learn. I have tried Pimsleur, and, in agreement with a few of the other reviews, I felt ""boxed in"" by the structure of the lessons. With ""Behind the Wheel"", you are able to construct sentences and THINK in the language, which, aside from residing in a French-speaking country, is the best way to learn. I do have a B.A. in Spanish and studied French in college (this program has made me much more fluent than I was then!), so I would caution a brand-new French student to be patient, go back and repeat the lessons, and try to think in French, even if it is just a few words a day. Also, as with any type of learning, your learning style and preferences will determine whether this product is good for you or not. My daily commute is much more enjoyable with these CD's playing in the car!"
2,Very Disappointed again in Sony,"I purchased this television 15 months ago from AFEES. Now I see I paid too much. Too bad they only back their purchases for one year. After intermitant use, mine stopped operating by displaying a flashing light indicating it may come on, but never does. For the time it did work, it seemed loud when powering up when I turned it on. I thought that was normal since it was new. Now I have a monument in my living room with a blank screen. Once again Sony has let me down. That's twice in three months. UPDATE... The technician replaced the $400 lamp and brought the TV back to life. Since then, I've waited for additional parts to correct the bright yellow appearance of my picture with large fuzzy rings and a lack of all reds and blues. The hits just keep on coming."
1,FATAL DESIGN FLAW!,"The Light Engine/optical block of this TV has a fatal design flaw. it is the subject of a class action lawsuit against Sony. The picture may look great at first by gradually begins to fail, producing the dreaded ""green blob."" I have had the light engine replace 4 times with no success. Do a google search on sxrd green blob class action. Stay away from this TV!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is not what is shown in the picture. You'll get some ""new sustainable version"" instead and it is gross. First off, it gets all soapy in your hand and the suds dont go away in your hands or face, with or without cotton pads. It smells the same as the original version initially but then it quickly fades to some other mysterious odor.I am pretty disappointed. product feels like it was tampered with. There was no safety packaging seal around the cap when it arrived."
4,"Wonderful Smell, Nice feel",This stuff smells AMAZING - definitely calms my skin and has left my face very even. I LOVE it - BUT I have products that I love more and give me better results. I would recommend this though.
3,didn't work for me,"after reading these reviews i was really excited to get this toner cuz it contained many natural ingredients and i was curious how the lavender smelt like. after using it, i started to break out terribly on my forehead. i just didn't understand, then i asked my sister if toner could break you out. she told me if it had oil in it, which this did...and we are having very hot summers so oily toner + moisturizer + plus extremely hot weather which makes my face even more oily = major breakouts. also i wasn't to pleased with the way it made my face feel after using it. i returned the product, sad that it didn't work for me. i don't blame it, but blame the time i decided to buy it in heat of summer"
3,so so,"This is a really uneven film. The parts that work are wonderful, but the parts that don't are quite bad. I'd never seen a movie this uneven before. After I saw it, I read an interview with Pierce Brosnan (who has a small role), and he said Warren Beatty would come on the set and try to take the directing job away from the director. So, I assume the good parts were when one of the two was directing, and the bad bits were when the other was directing. Whether the good bits were directed by Beatty, or the real director, I don't know!"
4,Fell short from An Affair to Remember,"A remake is a remake is a remake. So, I have quite accepted that the plot would have been almost carbon-copy-identical. Except for Pierce Brosnan, who may have added a few more mileage to the original & the original-remake characters, everything else seemed the same.The setting is enthralling & yes, romantic. But I think they have focused too much on the setting, especially the part where they had to visit the aunt. Annette Benning was ok but Warren Beatty was far too short compared with Carey Grant. One particular scene I would like to bring your attention to was his discovery of his painting in Annette's room. In ""An Affair to Remember"", Carey's expression was so intense & heartbreaking but Warren's was quite short in delivery.Overall, this version is a nice movie though & of course, romantic. Nice soundtrack too."
2,LOVE AFFAIR - JUST ANOTHER UPDATED CLASSIC THAT DIDN'T WORK,"Many of the reviews I read felt strongly in favor of this remake, but some of the people had not seen ""An Affair to Remember"". Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr had the spark so lacking in this ""Love Affair"" remake. The original ""Love Affair"" with (forgive me, I can only remember Irene Dunne as Terry, and my opinion that film was not as good as this ""Love Affair"", however. I missed hearing the original scoring of ""An Affair to Remember"", but Annette Benning's music with the children was lovely.As most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of ""An Affair..."", I missed the climactic ending with Cary Grant's reactions, and also the shipboard scene where he want's to be ""worthy of her love"".I don't wish to underrate or ""dump"" on this film, but I wish all reviewers would watch the Grant/Kerr version just once. I believe they will become ""old movie buffs"" too. Thanks for reading my review."
5,I don't understand...,"I really like this movie, obviously, as I would like to buy it on DVD. I own in on VHS. But, is there anyone out there who can tell me why this movie is sooooo expensive???????? I have been checking it since Christmas and the price has been up to $90 and not lower than $40.00. I have purchased movies (as far as same age of the movie) AND they have not been nearly this price, ever. Just curious if anyone has any insight on this. Thank you."
5,A love story to remember!,I was shocked to hear the bad reviews of this movie. I loved it! This could be because I never saw AnAffair to Remember. I cry everytimeI see it. I recommend this movie to everyone I talk to about movies. Annette Bening is beautiful and her acting wonderful. Warren Beatty sexyand handsome & smooth to top it off.
3,"I still think ""An Affair to Remember"" is better.","First off, I only saw the last half of the movie. (That's okay, I knew most of what happened.) Second, I missed the part I wanted to see. I COULD KICK MYSELF IN THE SEAT OF THE PANTS FOR MISSING KATHARINE HEPBURN!!!!!!!!!!! Obviously, that's the part I wanted to see. Anyway, the last half was pretty good (even though I missed the best part, dang drat it)."
3,KATE HEPBURN MAKES THIS WATCHABLE,"I have not seen the Cary Grant version so I had little to compare this predictable chickflick with. In fact the first 40 minutes or so can pretty much be skipped. I'd say the film even starts when Katherine Hepburn appears on the scene. She lends the movie its spine, the very reason our two protagonists come together, and the movie is a very decent romantic story from then on, with an occasional tinge of humor. Benning in particular is stunning with her understated rendition of a woman in emotional doldrums. A worthy rental overall, but not exactly a spectacular movie."
1,Doesn't hold a candle to the original,This is a remake of An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant and Deborah and it does not work. Some movies just should not be remade. The ONLY thing good about this movie is Katharine Hepburn's appearance. Get the original!
2,Not the same as the Original,I was expecting to better than the original since it was a remake and I love Anneth. However there's no sparks between her and beatty. It wasn't dramatic as the original. The love story between them was just bland.
4,Capturing the passion of the original,"Whether you are a Warren Beatty fan or not, the sincere interaction between Beatty and Benning is remarkable. The story is line is enhanced by the chance meeting on an airplane to only find themselves stranded on a Russian cruise ship. Vodka and love ensue. All the characters are charming and meeting his aunt, the formidable Katherine Hepburn, makes for a wonderful, albeit with obvious character building, love story. Worth the time, particularly if you enjoyed the original film."
5,This is true love!!! Great acting and great love story! I highly recommend,This is what ever person seeks; a soul mate connection. Everyone should experience this. This is one of my all time favorites!
4,Good value,"This product is much less bulky than a traditional jacket, and the manual-inflate type allows me to wear it with waders while beach seining, without worrying that it will auto-inflate on its own during contact with water."
4,Grover's Guide to Good Manners,"This book is a wonderful book to teach children, how to behave and how to respect and apprieciate their elders. After just reading the book once my children were saying ""Please"",""Thank you"" and ""Your Welcome"" all the time. This book is a must have in every household with children."
3,Nice explination,"Unlike many books of this type, this book was actually well writen and interesting to read! Nakano makes what could have been very dry discussions more entertaining by including real-life scenarios.The book takes you through web development processes, all the way from the one-man shop to the huge, mega-corporation. Yes, it does not give implementation details, but I think it does a very nice job at explaining the basic models in a black box way. (It is up to you to decide how you are going to do version control or enterprise content management.)"
2,More depth please Mr Nakano,"As a System Architect working with Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and particularly with Interwoven's Teamsite, I was eagerly awaiting the publication of a book that dealt with Content Management.However, on recieveing the book I was disapointed to release once again that the subject had been treated at such a high level as to be nearly useless to someone who already works within the field.I agree with other reviewers of the book that it does present a reasonable overview for those first dangling their feet in the CMS swamp.However, there is currently a great need for a book on ECM where the underlying principles and process of specifying, creating and validating a ""Content Architecture"" and Management System are seriously considered.Unfortunately this book is not it.If I had the time or money I would write one myself.Until then I keep my fingers crossed that Nakano is already working on one"
2,Not well written.,I donot like the style of this book. Same story or same meaning was told again and again. Anybody who wants to work for a big/medium website (targetd audience of this book) would definitely understand what is the problem. But the book doesnot clearly mention the solution to the key points or any very very interesting stuff. In fact only the summary of each chapter is the best part and worthy of reading. I regret buying this book.
5,Just like a visit to Wonderland,"This is the ultimate in pop up books. The entire world of Wonderland opens before you. My daughter and son (5 and 3) love playing with this. It is all the classic looking Alice, not DISNEY, with an abridged version of the book. It is paper so damage will happen after time. Ours is still standing albeit with some tape. This is also great for Alice collectors. You feel as if you could shrink down to 2 inches you could step right in and it would all come alive for you. Worth the price. Much better than other pop up books out there."
4,The title says it all! Not for the faint-of-heart!,A terrific suspense novel. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because I felt it could have ended much quicker than it did. Maybe too much information that wasn't relevant to the story. Too many scenes that made the story seem to go on forever. But I loved the storyline and all the characters. She kept me guessing right to the end. What a twist! And EROTIC! This should be classified under erotica. Very imaginative.
5,On the edge of your seat!,"This is a real page turner, full of wonderful characters, sass, humor, love, passion, and an incredible mystery. Once again, you don't want to leave these people who you have come to know so well. You hurt for them, and laugh with them. Great story!"
2,Nothing special...,I found the hero to be full of self-pity and self-hatred -- I mean the book does start with him contemplating suicide. This self-hatred thing prevented me from liking him too much. Yeah - I know he had reasons to be depressed but come on it is supposed to be a romance novel. I like a strong hero not a whiner. I also had issues with him falling in love within 24 hours with a woman who fell from the trees trying to get his photo. I had to flip through the ending - as another reviewer said it was like a long winded soap opera.
1,Find another book,"I'm looking for mythology books on egypt for a historical fiction novel I'm working on. This looked good on the web, but in reality it's a confusing mess. It's missing a complete list of Gods. The author rambles off uninteresting information. I was better off with wikipedia. I'd give this 0 stars if I could. Next time I'm going to an actual book store so I can properly preview books."
5,Great all the way around!,"Great sound, great performances and great song selection.Can't wait for volume two."
1,Pass this baby duck by!,"I first discovered the Baby Duck series with Amy Hest's delightful book, ""In the Rain with Baby Duck"". My toddler loved that book and we read it over and over. Having just had a new baby, I ordered ""You're the Boss, Baby Duck"" with high expectations of a similar experience. What a disappointment! While it captures how an older sibling may feel left out, it was very negative towards the new baby. I kept waiting for the part where Baby Duck bonds with the new baby and discovers how great it is to have a little brother/sister. Instead, by the end of the book, Baby Duck decides to let the baby stay ""for a couple of days"" so that she could boss her around. What kind of message about sibling love is that supposed to be sending? If you've just had a new baby in your house, I recommend ""Arthur's New Baby"" by Marc Brown instead. It effectively captures a child's jealousy in a much gentler way and has a much happier resolution.Pass this Baby Duck book by!"
5,Excellent Books,If you want a no nonsense study get this book. It helps me learn subnetting and and easier way to remember boot.ini
3,"Great review tool, but be careful of errors","This book is great if you are using it as it was meant to be used - a last minute review guide to reinforce the areas over which you'll be tested. There are numerous errors in the first printing, however a complete errata sheet is available at Exam Cram's web page. Correcting the mistakes can also be a form of study and reinforcement of the material."
1,A Thrown together poorly written book full of errors,"These books are a rushed joke. A sad case study for the computer industry. These guys have obviously rushed through printing these books without proper technical editing or reviewing. A bombardment of advertising and positive ""planted"" reviews will not make up for the lack of quality and technical accuracy. The books were rated well in the MCP Magazine so I felt really misled. That was obviously a setup becuase no one who read these books would have given them straight A's!! I sure hope this stays up becuase a lot of colleagues have written in commenting and they have been removed. We have come to find that the author's company is a partner of Amazon.com. Go Figure."
2,Some real review,I didn't like this book at all. Just read it and tried couple online tests. Some subjects not covered at all. Provides some very basic info about some basics. I already had a bad experience with ExamCram NetEss (see my review) and would give no another chance for ExamCram series. Sorry Ed. Now I have to buy more books to prepare for 70-068. Wish me good luck !
4,"I think it's decent, but too few questions!","The material is good, but I think they should have used different questions. The chapter on RAS was taken straight from the server book- which is fine- but so were the questions! That's kind of cheap. How about a little value-added for those who bought a second book?"
3,Maybe a 3.5?,"I norm dont watch anime like this but I bought it and wanted to give it a try. I seemed to like it. But it wasnt really good but it wasnt bad either. Which is why I have it a 3, maybe a 3.5 I need to see more of the series beofore I say anything else. So far it seems like a good anime. Only time can tell for me though."
2,"Fairly informative, but unstructured.","Although written for the prospective buyer of an Alfa, this book is difficult to follow. It does not adhere to chronology or any other logical structure, and it does little to decipher the convoluted model-variations schema that Alfa Romeo uses to identify its products. One major flaw: in most instances, it does not identify photographs by model year. A disappointment."
4,General info on all different models,"This book has definitely shed light all the different models that Alfa Romeo has put out, especially the Guilias and GTVs, which I am most interested in. Its not perfect, I couldn't find every answer I was looking for. For example it gives you identification numbers, but not where to find them. More info on how what to look for when buying a car would be great too. It is definitely worth buying though, especially someone new to the marque."
4,See this with an open mind.,All of these people who hated this movie have small minds. If you go into this movie looking for answers to all of the questions you will not like the movie.....I am a horror fanatic and I thought this was scary. But best of all was the idea behind the movie. I say buy the DVD and watch the movie with the directors commentary it will enlighten you. See This Movie.!
1,Wheres the Witch?,"I don't get it, how can you have a movie about a Witch but theres no Witch. Granted I was grossed out by the snot on the end of the girls nose but I would have liked to have had some other emotion.If this movie can make money, I'm thinking of making my own movie. Perhaps ""The Salem Vampire Project"" of course, don't hold your breath waiting for the Vampire to show up."
4,All the Cussing Made It More Funny Than Scary,"... having said that, I liked it anyway. Although, I saw 'The Curse of the Blair Witch' ""documentary"" on the Sci-Fi Channel and liked that a lot better. The good thing about the movie, though, was it's reliance on things you could not see, which is refreshing. It left me wanting to know what happened to Josh, because I *think* I saw what happened to Mike, He got the noose, right? And Heather was grabbed by something/someone, but Josh remains a mystery, and was that really him screaming? /"
2,Scary?,"I typically avoid watching horror movies - there have been so few good ones made. I find the slasher/ax killer/Scream genre boring - shock value and developing unseen horrors are very different. So, I approached the BWT with great anticipation. I have to admit I was extremely disappointed. I felt very little for the characters and the dialog seemed to be a continuous repetition of the f-word. The premise was a good one and I enjoyed the hand-held cinematography, but the plot just never held me. To wait 80-some minutes for a final scene that was already known was a big letdown. If you want to see a really scary film, go watch something like The Shining."
3,"has its good bits, but drags on","I went into the movie theater telling myself I was going to be traumatised for life. For the first half an hour, I tried to distance myself and tell myself it was just a movie. Then I realised something - 95% of the movie isn't scary. There's only two scary parts to the movie, collectively lasting about 7 minutes, and ranking only a 4 star scariness. I'm not saying it was a bad movie - I thought it could have been quite cool. But after about 20 minutes of rambling on, we got the idea - they were lost. The movie could have been cut by at least 40 minutes, which would have resulted in a 5 star rating."
3,A Play on the Imagination,"This movie energized my imagination. I never saw the witch (or whatever), so that made me create an image that was probably scarier than any one made up for me. This movie didn't require blood, guts, masks, or deadly weapons to scare me. All I could think was, ""What would I do in this situation?"" And seeing there was nothing a person could do (except wait for death), made me very uncomfortable."
1,It had Beenway to over hyped,"I just want to say that is a good movie, but it is over hyped. Its really not to scary"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I didn't see what was so great about this movie. I Believe I wasted my $10 to watch it. As the movie progressed I kept wondering when it would get good. There is no attention getter in the beginning and was even somewhat hard to understand. The professionals did not make this movie and it is very obvious. The ending went no where! It was over and there wasn't on good part to even comment on. I've seen several of the other newly released movies like The Haughting and The Sixth Sense, after these movies I at least felt like I spent money on something and I did not waste over an hour of my life on nothing. Blair Witch Project was a complete and total waste of time and money. Go see The Sixth Sense twice if you want to watch another movie."
1,Total suck!!,"This movie is so bad I can not even finish. It is totally sucked with some idiot idea of some idiots getting lost in woods. The camera work is unforgiveable just like a family shot from back yard. I can not believe some people can spend 90 minutes to watch it! I tried to find 0 star for this review but I can not. Oooh, what a waste of life for people to make it, to watch it, and at this minute the guy writing this comment. Who was the idiot make it anyway?"
1,Can you say BORING?!!!!!!!!!!,"I went to see the BWP with great expectations,mainly because of all the great reviews I read. Talk about dissapointment! I don't think I have ever been so bored by a film in my life. I can only guess that the critics saw another version of this movie,that can be the only explaination for the hype. I don't have to have blood and guts in a movie to scare me,some of my favorites are pretty much bloodless (Halloween,Legend Of Hell House)but give me something other than jerky camera work and a very pointless plot. Scary? I have seen scarier episodes of Scooby-Doo. Don't waste your time on this one. You would be better off putting your money through a paper shredder!"
3,excellent idea for a movie very different is all I can say,"I seen the blair witch project on video, and it was just like i imagined it would be, the scenes were just like anyone in the woods taping there time there, with a horror twist to it. Yes I was scared only because it seemed so real . I applaude the writer who thought of this idea,even though the movie was short and you knew the ending it is still a great idea for a movie."
3,You may wish this was a true story...,"Alright. It's a clever film. It uses video tricks, real-life dialogue and a pretty good story-line to bring you along. The woods in mid-autumn never seemed quite so menacing. But I felt that, somehow, the three characters actually deserved their fate, with all their whining and moaning. How unprepared they were, prancing off into the wild without a proper map, and adequate supplies! But, I forgot, it's only a movie. Speaking of which, if you're being preyed upon by some unseen evil entity, why would you keep taping? I'd personally drop the equipment and run like hell 'till I found civilization. Apart from this hole in the premise, ""Blair Witch"" does a good job of scaring you psychologically. At least there'll be no sequel to spoil it."
5,"I am amazed,","I can't understand the Bad reviews on this page, oh wait I forgot what country I'm in, I also Forgot that to most people Horror means Half Naked women bieng murdered by Maniacs, but for those of us that have a Decent or above average IQ, and an imagination, and have been camping, will REALLY enjoy this Film,"
1,What did they spend the money on when making this movie?,"I totally disliked this movie. It was not as scary as it has been cracked up to be and they shook the camera so frequently that I barely made it to the bathroom to be sick once the movie was over. It is an overrated movie, but what can you expect for so little money?"
5,great suspensful movie but get a damned tripod next time.,"This was movie was a great original idea, with the suspense building right to the very end, definetaly gave me the chills, and I'm one to balk at every horror film out there, but the one thing that almost gave me seizures was the shaky camera work, I had to move right to the back of the theatre for the ending because my head hurt so much trying to follow the shaky action. if you haven't seen this, trust me sit as far back as possible."
1,A real stinker...,"Maybe it lost something in the transition from the big screen to the small, but I just don't see what all the hype and rave reviews were about. I suppose it is unique from a standpoint of cinema verite', but I found ""The Blair Witch Project"" BORING. Save your money."
4,Glad I gave it another chance...,"I saw this movie when it first came out, in the movie theatre. However, it was one of those old, kind of run down movie theatres and the sound was terrible. You literally could hear none of the scary sounds that torment Heathr, Josh and Mike at night. I remember being very disappointed.However, I just recently watched this again on my laptop..I turned the lights down, put on my headphones, and what a huge difference. Very creepy. I also think the hype it got back in 1999 kind of backfired. This isn't ""in your face"" gory horror. No, this is a slow buil-up of dread and desperation and the ending gives me chills just thinking about it."
2,Advertising seduces audience to attend,"No way. The only withces around are those who are casting spells on the general public to purchase tickets to see this movie. If the f-word were eliminated, the female character would practically be a mute. Hey, if I throw away my map, I can get lost too in the woods. Take a Boy Scout camping lesson and get real.Two stars for filming of trees and water and trees and a pile of stones. And two stars for not costing millions and millions of dollars."
1,blair witch is all hype!,"this movie is so ridiculus,thewitch in the wizard of oz wasmore frightning then this one!if you like listening to kidsargue and looking at sticksand rocks then this is yourtype of movie.believed me iwatched it with an open mindand tried to put myself in thier position.the actors inthe movie did a good job ofrunning around scared,but ifound no suspense at all.thenoises in the woods i couldhardly hear,the final scenewas a joke,all it was is abunch kids letting theirimagination run wild,if thesekids had any common sense theywould had brought a cell phonewith them,i guess they had toomuch video equipment to carryimaybe the sequal will be better."
5,A Classic!!,"This horror film should go down as one of the best in history. It is not meant for gore-worshippers or Independence Day type movie lovers. It's aimed at the imaginative child in all of us....remember when you were scared of the dark and all that was hidden? Watch the movie closely, immerse yourself into their world. Only then will you truly appreciate the absolute horror this movie is about. Do not bother seeing this movie if you're idea of horror is ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". Only intelligent, imaginative minds will appreciate Blair Witch."
3,Interesting....but very dissapointing at the end....,"This movie was very original and had some interesting parts. Like others have said...I think it would have been extremely scary if we didn't know it was fiction. But, since we did, the camera work was shaky, which is understandable but got annoying after awhile. I was also annoyed by the ""F"" word being used in every other line. This may have been to make it more ""real"", but I have to say that my friends don't use the ""F"" word that many times in one day. But....I enjoyed this movie, it seemed short though and just when I was really getting into it, it went off! I was so let down by the ending. I don't think scary describes this movie best. I think ""creepy"" is more like it. I could watch it again."
2,Not all that impressive,"I gave one star for cleverness nd the other for the fact that I thought Mikey was pretty well acted. Rmemeber that. Acted... While the fear may have been real on these actors, what having little idea what they were actually doing, it wasn't real. It was fake... people don't seem to remember that.And, the other reason i didn't like it? I didn't see any witch, and i could easily explain everything in the movie... a little to simple to be creepy."
3,A Mixed Bag,"The Blair Witch Project was a very original and unique idea, and that part of the movie I respect. Unfortunately, I felt they left TOO many unanswered questions. If they had answered a little more, than I would have had some direction as to maybe how the movie ended, but they left it so wide open that I found it too be less scary. People who like scary movies, I recommend to watch it, other people, you may want to skip it because a lot of it's hype."
5,Gee!,"Good, this film is great! The fact of you don't know what is scaring the 3 actors is just amazing! I don't like very much this kind of films, but this one is better than I expected. And the end is so tragic! The wall stained by children hands! Oh, I don't know what to said. This film will be a classic."
2,I've seen stuff in my fridge scarier than this.,"OK, so I will give it some credit. It was scary the last 3 minutes. But the other hour and 12 minutes seemed to be fuzzy, migrane inducing footage of grass going by as whoever was holding the camera ran from some unseen 'witch'... or chased after the punk that kicked the map into the river. The plot is almost impossible to follow, unless it was for the characters to argue about trivial things. This movie was definatly not what it's all hyped up to be."
5,It was good but...,It was very good. It scared the hell out of me...until i found out it wasn't real. These 3 actors did an incredible job. I do have a question that I would like answered though. Ok..so I know the movie wasn't real but what about the curse? Was there really a blair witch and is there really a legend. Was it all make believe?
5,It was like it was really happening to me !!,It really scared the hell out of me. I watched it by myself at 9:00 pm and was awake until 6:00 am the next day I was so scared. I didn't find out until after the movie was over and 3 days later that it wasn't true. That really made me mad. But the movie kicked butt anyway. It all seemed as though it was happening to me while watching it. Knowing its now not true I still think about it every night before I sleep!
1,Terrible!,"This has got to be the WORST movie I have ever had the displeasure of watching. 10 minutes into the movie, I wanted all of the characters to just die already to put ME out of my misery. I will concede that the concept was excellent - however, the characters (she was extremely annoying & pretentious - does she ever SHUT UP?!?), the dialogue and the hand held camera work was nauseating - literally & figuratively. I need some dramamine as I was suffering from motion sickness throughout the movie.This was a complete waste of my time and money."
4,"i really liked this movie,until i learned that it wasnt real","for me,it was really,really great the first time i saw it.then i saw them on TV and i didnt like the movie as much as i did before.i still love this movie but not as much"
1,the hype is confusing,"To say I was eagerly anticipating this film is a major understatement. Have you heard all the hype about the brilliance of letting three kids loose in the woods with hand-held cameras? Some brilliance...unfortunately, the revered camera footage made me physically ill...literally. I had to leave the theatre to throw up.I wasn't scared. I wasn't interested. I was confused. And then it hit me...advertising is genius! THAT'S how they got me into the theatre! I was just a sheep! This film has approximately 30 seconds of redemption- the last scene. That's it. This was a real disappointment for me because I love independent film in general and was glad these guys got their turn- I just didn't feel it was deserved in this case. Good idea, nice mythology... really bad flick. (Not to mention the nausea. I'm serious about this one.) If you haven't seen it, just watch the trailer. That's the entire movie in a nutshell."
1,WHAT?,This movie is the wrost movie I have ever seen in my life.Its not scary at all and it has no excitment to it.Don't waste your money on this movie.
4,I was really surprised to find out it wasn't real!,"Even though the filming makes your eyes hurt and your head spin, it makes up for the psychological intensity you feel. You knew they were obviously going to be in trouble, but the question was when and how. I think the filmmakers were geniouses in making a movie that seemed so real, not just in the filming, but also playing with the actors' minds to make their emotions really come out."
2,"If this is scary, we have lost our senses","Hey the hype is hype. A group of morons go to the woods, throw away their compass, and worry about filming everything as they become victims of the Lord of the Flies syndrome. Please, give me a break, give me some good honest stuff from Psych 1, or even the old Haunting. Not escapades of the the three stooges in the woods."
2,All Hype !!!,"I thought the concept of this movie was a good idea, but it was very poorly executed. Scary?, not by a long shot, pretty hilarious though, my wife and I laughed throughout most of the movie. The ending was a disapointment. Did I get it, of course I got it. Am I a slasher movie type, NO. Although I would recommend Scream. The idea behind the movie was scary, the movie was not. Would have made a better book. For anyone who thinks this a true story, please. You really need to get a life. If you really want to see a good horror flick, try The Shining, Pet Cemetary or The Exorcist."
1,Save your money!,"My neighbors an I both rented this movie at the same time. About thirty minutes into the movie, I called to ask them how they liked it. And, not much to my suprise, they had turned it off, just like we did. RI-DIC-U-LOUS!"
2,"it was watchable, but i'm still lost.","this wasn't the best film i've seen,but it was interesting trying to figure out what was going to happen next. i wish it could have been more specific so that i wouldn't fill so lost."
2,Trying to find a bus home was scarier,"This film was definitely over-hyped in the UK. In terms of high-quality storyline, it failed miserably. In terms of scariness - well, go and see Plan 9 From Outer Space, or Star Trek 2 - they're far scarier. Maybe David Lynch should do a version, as there was a lot more suspense in the Lost Highway than this film. The scariest thing was that I'd swapped one of my many NIN tickets to see this film..."
1,"1 star because of dripping nose, proves she was COLD","What I really get sick of hearing is ""If you didn't like it you didn't understand it""...all people are different and have different likes and dislikes, just because I found this movie to be BORING, UNscary, and plain old UNentertaining, DOESN'T mean I didn't UNDERSTAND it. I DID understand it, I GOT the point, I just DIDN'T CARE because it was so LOUSILY done(in my opinion), and I am one that gives movies a VERY wide berth when I watch them, I can find a good point with just about ANY movie, the only one I could find with this movie was that it only cost them (LUCKY for them, but they were OVERCHARGED) $35,000 to make. I think a LOT of people bought into the hype before going to see it and are just afraid to ADMIT that they didn't like it. I LOVE documentaries and indie films, but this one was a BITTER disappointment (for ME)."
1,You have got to be kidding!!!,"I don't know what was worse: the severe motion sickness I got while watching this film or the constant use of the word f**k throughout the movie. That word must have been used at least 500 times. And as for the 3 so-called ""filmakers"", I wouldn't trust them to even take a trip out to their backyard let alone the vast wilderness. Needless to say I was very disappointed by this movie. I look back now and think, ""what was all of the hype about?!!)"
1,This movie really scared me!,"I was so scared as I drove back to Best Buy, ""will they take it back?"" I fretted. I don't mind telling you I was a shivering wreck by the time I got to the service desk. But the girl said ""yes!"" Whew, for a few minutes there I was scared to death!"
1,best medicine for insomnia,"This is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. All reviews brag about the low cost of production - 40.000$ or so ... guess what ... you got that much out of it (proportionally speaking). Anybody with 400$ to put down for a video camera and perhaps 500$ for 16mm rental can do as good as those guys... Great marketing, however..."
1,Shaky as hell,"If it's a repetitive, dull, boring, amateurish, uninspired, and altogether wortless movie you're after, look no further than The Blair Witch Project. This movie has an intelligence and scare factor of zero. One star is far too generous for this drivel."
4,Heather's Reactions Make This Movie,"Atmospheric, scary story ala M. Night Shyamalan. You don't have to see the monster or buckets of blood to be creeped out.The ensemble cast is great, but Heather's reactions when it all comes unravelled really make this movie all the more devastating. Her discovery that they've been travelling in circles, her reaction to the contents of the bundle of sticks outside their tent (screams, handwashing, gloves, trying to put on the backpack), her soliloquy into the camera...it doesn't get any more raw than that. And to think it was all improvised! She deserved an Oscar. Really.If you can get past all those f-words, this is a well-crafted, creepy movie that doesn't depend on gross-outs."
1,An extended examination of complaining& walking in the woods,"If you ever had a great interest in exploring the intriguing drama of people walking endlessly in the woods and complaining constantly to and about each other, this is the movie for you.This movie could best be described as ""Alien"" set in the woods without the Alien.The complaining is only interupted by the jiggling of the camera as the cast run through the woods scared as hell that they found some sticks and rocks. Imagine that. Sticks and rocks in the woods! Very spooky indeed!Unexplained is how these unemployed imbeciles ever got accepted into the community college in the first place and where they got enough film in their camera to film the entire Godfather trilogy.The only monster(s) this horror movie has are the ones who collected the millions and millions of dollars of box office receipts without paying for any special effects payout or any witch at all."
4,Refreshingly different,"This ""amateur"" movie is simply brilliant. Refreshingly different. Sublime acting which is almost too realistic. The artistic effects are so simple they're genius. And the movie shows how subjective a camera is - you feel claustrofobically imprisoned inside the borders of the very screen, so you sit'n'think: No! Look over there instead! THERE!. An experience! (But of course it is much much better on the big screen!)"
4,Simply one of the most successful cinematographic projects.,"The Blair Witch Project is completely different from anything ever produced in Hollywood. No special effects. No movie stars. Just originality and a very involving and disturbing story that dominate the public and silence them, as the movie proceeds and the expectation increases. Whatever is said concerning The Blair Witch Project is not enough to describe the experience of watching this movie. It is a psychological experience. You have to feel the terrifying atmosphere of the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland, and the despair and suffering of Heather, Mike and Josh, the three student film makers who disappeared in there. All the movies, from now on, are going to seem kind of artificial. The Blair Witch Project is really scaring because it is scaryly real. It seems so real, so spontaneous, that you forget the fact that it is just a movie. It is simply a despairing motion picture that you will never forget."
3,I may never walk in the woods again...,"This was a truly freaky movie. It seemed very realistic. The ending absolutely STANK! I've heard that they want to make a sequel.. Where would they go from? They all died! Anyway, I really liked this movie. I stayed away from the woods, or any trees, for a long time after I saw this."
2,"Great idea, but...","This was a very original movie and idea. HOWEVER... I should have taken Dramamine before going to see it. There was another comment in here about these students being Film students. I myself studied film and I think a 5-year-old would have better control of the camera. Think of your audience, for crying out loud! Not to mention half the time you were staring at the ground while they walked. Mmm... boy, did that keep my attention. Ha!! It was too hyped up for what it turned out to be."
2,Boring.,"The only thing I really liked about this video was the concept of three pretentious student film makers getting lost in the woods and eventually meeting a gruesome demise. The concept, however, is not anything we haven't seen before. ""Cannibal Holocaust"" for one, an Italian horror film made a a long time ago. The execution of the film was irritating but I am glad that a film like this was made. I just wish they kept it a secret a little bit longer."
1,BORING and NAUSEATING,"between the boredom and the nausea from the jerky camera action i wish i had had the foresight to bring my phenergan. i have spent a lot of time in the woods both in north america and africa and these guys don't have a clue what really scared in the woods is all about. they,in the movie,were unprepared and were obviously never boy(or girl)scouts. If you want to be scared save you money buy a tent and go on a camping trip for the real things ""that go bump in the night""."
1,Yawn.,"One of my friends told me that he was ""shaking"" when he came out of the theatre after watching this movie. I decided to see what all the hype was about, and was very disappointed. The movie started out slow, continued to be slow, and ended just as it became interesting. I was told by another friend that this movie was produced by college students. I'm not suprised."
4,The best horror film in years,"More than any movie I can think of, the Blair Witch Project needs to be viewed with a morbid curiosity rather than melodramatic expectancy. Those who recognize and simply watch it for what it is - the combined and edited footage of the last days of the three students' lives - will be rewarded with what is, honestly, one of the most disturbing horror films in years. Those looking for clever plot twists, slick editing and heroic dialog will be appropriately disappointed."
1,This Project Gets a Failing Grade,"This movie had an incredible amount of hype. When people started comparing it to The Exorcist, I knew I had to see it.I'm used to folks in horror movies acting irrationally. I know they'll make the wrong decisions; it's just part of the genere. And I'm completely capable of losing myself in a movie. But these three idiots wandering around in the woods, in circles, without a map? And they can't make it out in three or four whole days?You've got to be kidding me.I couldn't help but be annoyed with the whiny, moody female lead, and be frustrated with her bumbling side-kicks.I was frightened. I was frightened that people so stupid really do exist in our world and that, as they wander lost in a huge broad circle, they'll eventually cross my path."
1,Come on!,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was so ambitious to see this from all the hype I heard. ""Scarriest movie ever"" yeah right. 80% of the movie we saw dead dry leaves or things that we had no clue what we were looking at. And the ending which thought would be cool sucked the most. Please don't see this movie it totally sucks!"
3,SCARY AS HELL I THINK NOT,EVERY ONE OF MY FRIENDS SEEN IT AT THE MOVIES ITS SCARY THEY WOULD SAY.I MYSELF LOVED SCARY MOVIES. IM AN EXPERT AT ALL MOVIES. SO WHEN IT CAME OUT I WANTED TO RENT IT BUT THEY DIDNT HAVE IT. I GOT OUT MY MONEY AND BOUGHT IT TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION OF THOUSANDS OF MOVIES. IT WAS A WAIST IT WASNT SCARY AT ALL. IT WAS WAS ARGUING AND CUSSING AND AT THE END WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY FELL ASLEEP AT THE BEGINNING SO THEY DIDNT EVEN HERE THE CURSE. IM MEAN. I LIVE IN THE WOODS AND IT ISNT EVEN SCARY TO ME A BIT SO IF I WERE U DONT BUY THIS MOVIE. YOULL REGRET IT JUST LIKE I AM. ALL ITS GOOD FOR IS TAKING UP SPACE ON UR MOVIE RACK.
1,If I could give this movie 0 stars I would,One of the worst films I've ever seen. The screen shakes so much and I almost threw up I mean geez I could do (have) this film in the woods with a really really cheap camera. Also it seems the only word Heather Donahue seems to know in the movie is f--- If you are smart you wouldn't rent this film it's not even scary I mean if ooze dripping from trees and a full moon scares you maybe you should see a doctor.
5,Ordered as soon as I saw it,"So ok, I went to the cinema with 4 friends to see this movie, I sat there watching every moment, aware of every breath I took, and was creepted out by its eerieness. Out of the 4 of us 2 liked it, the other 2 didnt, but we all agreed it was very very interesting. For people who say this is the wrose movie they have ever seen, i find that hard to believe, even if you didnt enjoy it, you can still appeicate the concept, and production."
1,Insomnia cure or WHAT ?,"Sorry, but this has to be the biggest turkey of 1999. Interesting dialogue would have been good instead of ""cool, hey man, f**k you"" etc. To be honest, death came as a relief at the end of this. I don't think I've ever been so happy to see (or sit and read) the closing credits in my entire life. An episode of the Muppets is scarier than this trash."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","This was a loooooooong drawn out mock documentary. Extremely thin plot and freewheeling acting -- obviously no script. Not much detail about the ""Blair Witch"", this movie just went on and on and on -- going in circles just as the three characters did.The ending came as a total surprise. There was no advance warning of what was coming and no revelation of what had actually happened --- it just ended. Well, I guess that's what happens in mock documentaries!"
3,Blair Witch,"I just watched the Blair Witch Project. All I can say is, ""That's a waste of [thousands of] dollars."" The plot line follows 3 college students going into the forest in Burkittsville, MD to film a piece on the supposed ""blair witch."" Many people I spoke to said they couldnt sleep for days, blah blah blah. The ending parts did spook me out, but some parts were just ridiculous. If I got any lesson from this film, it would be:Bad things happen to those who say [some words]too much."
3,68 minutes of intro with a great ending...,"What the hell was all the hype about? Apart from the last ten minutes, nothing happened. But to be fair, it was worth the ending. Uneasy setting and a fear of the unknown meant it was perfect to scare people. Why couldn't it have been then minutes of crappy, boring intro, and sixty-eight minutes of nervous running where it was evident that somthing sinister was present? Well not bad on a budget of peanuts. But in my humble opinion, the second one was better. Enjoy!"
1,About As Scary As A Nickolodeon TV Show.,"I heard many great things about this movie.It got great reviews and everything.I also heard alot of people say things like ""The Blair Witch Project is even scarier than the Excorcist"".Because I heard so many great things,I decided to see this movie,expecting to be scared out of my mind.Turns out,I wasn't scared one bit.This is one of the most non-scariest movies ever created.It is just unbelievable how un-scary this movie is.Basically,all it is is just 3 morons carrying around a camera saying cuss words at any given time.It's hard to see anything since the camera is all shakey and blurry.So overall,this movie was just plain bad.If you are looking for a scary movie,just keep walkin',because this movie is definitely not for you.Peace Out."
2,"Not Scary, But Interesting...I Guess..","There was a little too much talk about this film, its definitely worth watching, but it isnt what it seems from previews..First of all, them walking in the woods talking about unrelated things is the most boring thing ever..They put things in this film that could have been cut..(well about 80% of the film!)But when it was supposed to be scary, its just kinda interesting I guess.. But one more thing is how it ended, made it lose a star...The only purpose for this was a cheap attempt to make a sequel..(Which absolutely flopped!)If your looking for scary, rent Hellraiser, put down The Blair Witch Project! Its as scary as There's Something About Mary!"
2,Not that good!,"A decent film by aspiring film makers. I was not scared though, maybe a few chills every once and a while. It was a short movie, but it seemed to drag on forever. I hated the female character, she had a vulgar mouth and her acting was terrible. I was very disappointed in the ending. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. Rent at your own risk!"
2,The movie was boring and the actors were the only good thing,"I am soory because i was all reved up to see a spine tinling of a film and what came out to be was a movie that was less scary than the chucky movies. The actos were good though, especially heather. My advice: Rent the movie first!"
4,Stylish and Scary,"Despite the fact that this little movie was grossly over-hyped, it still delivers on what it promises: a visually fresh and psychologically scary odyssey into the unknown. While combining an ultra-modern documentary-style filmmaking technique with the old-fashioned ""less is more"" philosophy, the filmmakers have succeeded in making something original and genuinely frightening.Although I didn't think it was totally terrifying, I do feel it was suspensful and scary enough. The real appeal is the exploration in human psychology, as we see the breakdowns that fear, disorientation, and physical discomfort can cause. The young actors did a great job portraying their emotions, and hopefully they will move on from here.I recommend this movie to genre buffs and curious fans alike. It is satisfying and fun."
3,Victim of backlash,"Nine months ago this was the hottest film going, then it became too hot. The popularity backlashed and where 9 months ago everyone was saying that it was an 'ambitious and imaginative new idea', now it is 'poor film making'. People are fickle.This film is not 'Citzen Kane', but it is interesting to watch. Get the DVD so you can listen to the director commentary, the behind the scenes makes it more interesting. If you are offended by foul mouths, you will not find any more cursing in a film than in 'TBWP' so be warned."
3,Seems everyone else has to love or hate this movie,"I think it was a good start but came up short. The idea of 3 college kids saying 'lets go make a movie about a witch legend' and then things turn in unforeseen ways sounds plausible. You follow their progress from naive bravado to chaotic madness, as the 'witch' is playing mind games with them. The swearing, that upsets some viewers seems natural for scared, tired & hungry people. If you took some urban slackers who didn't have clue one about survival, - (they didn't even bring some extra candy bars?) -, they would start behaving like these 3 do.My problem with the movie is I think these 'no conclusion reached' endings are a cop on the plot. Furthermore they act like such fools I lost all empathy for them and didn't care if they lived or died because I was so tired of hearing these jerks. There isn't any `supernatural' forces needed to kill them, they could destroy themselves."
1,Can't believe people are actually falling for this ...,"I'm just appalled (sp?) by how many people are actually falling for this movie. I was expecting something better. The only reason I finished the film was because I waited and waited the entire 70-80 minutes hoping to see at least a brief moment of the Witch or the creature or the creepy children or whatever that was scaring the hell out of these 3 unintelligent kids, but never had a chance because it was never there. All I've got were constant foul languages throughout the entire film. Then the film suddenly ended...that was it?Thumbs way down for this film. Very likely will not watch another cheap film by such filmmaker. You've gotten my money, at least give me something worthwhile!! Guys, go grab ""THE SHINING"" or ""THE GRUDGE"" or ""THE RING"" if you need to be scared."
2,My Little Cousin even thought it wasn't scary,"I remeber watching it when I was 8 and I was so scared. A couple of years later I was watching with my 5 year old cousin telling her to close her eyes,But for what? I can't belive I thought it was even scary. Half the time you can't even understand what they're doing. All I want to say is that anyone who wants to buy the movie, just rent it, the 2nd one is much better anyway."
1,No good on video!,"I loved this movie in the theater -- I saw it in an early showing before all of the media hype came about, and it was terrifyingly wonderful. However, in video form, it loses not some, but ALL of its punch. What a bore."
5,Excellent entertainment.,"The Blair Witch Project is a big-hype movie that will seriously scare the pants off ya. But don't expect to be frightened straight away, as smartly this film starts out slow, but its gets horrifying in the end. I guarantee you will never want to go into the woods ever again.The acting is so good I seriously thought they were really lost and someone was really stalking them - that is how powerful the film is and how good the movie is is equal to how real it may be.The Blair Witch Project is a modern masterpeice of horror that I totally recommend you see because your missing out on a good film."
1,Hansel & Gretel meets Dumb & Dumber,"Within the first 5 minutes of the movie, I couldn't wait for the characters to be killed off by something, anything...I'm begging!The movie does not frighten at any point nor on any level. The only level where the film succeeds is in the creation of the most annoying, witless, slacker, and congenitally stupid characters in cinematic history. I would throw the video away today but the Swiss authorities would have just cause to fine me for littering."
2,Like Chinese Food,"The anticipation is great, it tastes great going down, but you're hungry an hour later.You have to REALLY pay attention to details in this movie or you'll miss the whole scary moment. Seriously. Take notes if you aren't capable of remembering conversations 10 minutes later.Scary? Yes, for literally 2 minutes. Interesting experiment in film-making. Definitely not a video I would consider adding to my fairly large horror collection."
1,"1 word""AWFUL""","Let me follow you around on a camping trip for 2 hours then you watch it when you get home,think that will be exciting?I asked if they would pass out thumbscrews when i was at this movie.Screwdriver in my ear was looking good at the time."
1,"Silly, not scary, a waste of time","I was all set for a scary movie, having heard how good it was form friends. I watched it late at night, alone, in the dark. What a waste. I suppose someone who'd never been in the woods might have a different view."
3,Take away the hype and ...,"After all the hype I thought this would be a bad movie and, lo and behold, it is. The best features of it - the strange heaps of stones and figures in the wood - were much, much better in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and the ""amateur"" touch was really silly. Who in the world would go on filming when they're nearly dying? so after a while I turned it off and watched my Uncle Joe's holiday films instead which were much, much more interesting ..."
1,I can think of 20 movies right now much scarier!,"Maybe ... just maybe if this had been a *true* story it would've seemed more interesting, but it's not, and the only reason I went to see this film was because of the overated hype about it being to terrifying. Calling this the scariest thing since the excorcist is a major insult to the loads of truly terrifying movies out there. Geeez, Stigmata was much more comparible to the excorsist than this!I remember when I left the the theater after this movie was over people were quite despondant about it and I even heard some moans and booing behing me! Several people commented on how the constant moving camera was causing them nausia and dizziness, fear of loosing my popcorn in the theater was scarier than what was actually going on in the film.I don't even think renting this movie for Halloween is worth it either. I can't believe these kids are rich over a movie of which I could have writen a much better plot for!"
1,its just a bunch of hippies screaming,"this movie dosen't make any sense. i mean the story's messed up,and so is every thing else. its not scary because it never shows this so called ""witch"". it just shows people running away screaming. its not scary, completley stupid and low on special features. and if they were going to make this movie, use the actual film instead of sing another one. Horror fans might want to rent it."
1,Worst film I have ever seen,"If you enjoy seeing three whiny teenage morons getting lost, waste 2 hours of your time."
1,Gives Me a New Appreciation for Bad Movies,"I now have a new standard for measuring bad movies since seeing the Blair Witch Project. After 6 months of hype, I saw the thing and couldn't believe how boring useless this film was. Later that week, a friend talked me into seeing The Haunting, another really bad ""scary"" movie. I rated The Haunting by saying that I would still rather see it 3 times than Blair Witch 1 time. Now my scale for bad movies is the BWP Meter. The Bone Collector, for example, was not SO bad. It just had some big plot holes and characterization problems. I'd see it 5 times before I'd see BWP once; therefore it's 5 on the BWP Meter."
1,Worst film ever !,"Why can't I rate -1 star? Maybe my expectations were raised too high because of the enormous hype surrounding this film but buying the DVD was one mistake to learn from. Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for something scary to happen. But no, right up until the end it remained boring as boring can be. People who like watching trees and some dead wood might like it. Don't expect a storyline or plot, there just isn't any. I watched it 3 times thinking I might'ave missed something. But no...it's just a 95 minute documentairy on dead wood."
5,"The more I watch it, the more I think this film is GREAT.","Granted, it is difficult NOT to get turned off by the seemingly endless hype surrounding this film (I saw it in the theatre when it was first released), but after purchasing the DVD version of ""The Blair Witch Project"", I'm now convinced that it is brilliant. To get the full 'Blair Witch' effect, watch ""The Curse of the Blair Witch"" documentary before viewing the actual film. It will make the experience much more creepy and is quite comprehensive in its history of the 'legend'. So, as a few others have mentioned, use your imagination, as opposed to having Hollywood graphically present it all to you, and you'll appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. This is truly a realistic, inventive and disturbing film. Ignore the advice of the naysayers. Most of them probably love the usual overproduced stuff that comes out of the major studios."
1,Great ID......Horrobol movie,The only thing that net to do so this cut be a 5 star movie is the 3th camera...3 kids lost in the woods...and will get crasy...the movie is like homecamera making...that sukz
1,The most overhyped/rated movie in years,"This ""film"" is no good. It is neither scary, interesting nor well-made. A complete waste of time."
1,Overrated - Don't believe the hype,"The movie was bad in almost every way. It was not scary, the acting was merely fair.I guess it's worth seeing from a pop culture point of view, but I won't consider owning it.This is a renter."
1,Much ado about nothing,"I kept reading and hearing about how frightening and engrossing this movie was. After watching it, I have to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It certainly doesn't measure up to all the hype it has received."
1,Believer...?,"It's one of the worst movies of all times....! There's simply NOTHING ! It's not a film; it's a pure crap..A bunch of students trying to scare u by shouting,crying..etc.etc. They'r pathetically trying to persuade u that they'r in danger.. followed by a creature that they call ""witch""! C'on people, no one will buy that kind of crap..! P.S. Don't waste your TIME & MONEY....!"
3,Nothing much but the hype...,"I agree that TBWP is such a unique film. Unique in the sense that the presentation was quite different -- the audience were watching through the lens & seemingly made them part of the actors/cast. However, it made me feel awfully sick afterwards & whatever good things I may be able to say about the film, that awful headache just overcame everything else. Considering it was a low-budget film raking in millions of bucks afterwards, you just have to hand it out to the marketing staff who created much hype & made the film too curious & attractive to gullible people. No offense meant to other viewers but I did not find it scary at all."
1,I wanted to like this movie...,"I really wanted to like this movie when I saw it this summer. I waited in line twice (the first time it was sold out) and I drove close to 25 miles to see it. I was sorely disappointed. The entire theatre was laughing during the ""most tense"" moments of the film. By then I was laughing as well..."
1,The Blair Witch Project,"I think it is just a load of swear words and rocks! It is the worst movie ever! And dosen't even have a proper ending, You can easily hear what their favourite word is before 10 minutes of the nonimpressive start. And instead of a conclution it leaves you dazzled! I recomend you not to buy this appaling movie! It will put you off any movie that says it's creepy!"
1,Unwatchable,"This is a sorry excuse not just for a movie but for a direct-to-video or really any form of entertainment. Poorly thought out, ""written"", ""directed"", acted (you would be rooting for the characters demise throughout if there were actually anything out there to root for) and edited. Great marketing campaign on the web made this movie into the hype-monster it became. As for those woods they were lost in, I've seen scarier backyards....."
1,Terrible AND Boring...a double offense,"What a stupid movie.... I couldn't stop laughing at how NOT scary it was. The character's were so annoying, it was a relief when they started to disappear. Don't waste your time. I get soooo scared by anything remotely scary and this had me LAUGHING. Awful awful awful."
1,The worst!,Absolutely the worst film (and I'm including home movies in the selection universe) I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it don't fall for the hype and saveyour money.
1,PURE GARBAGE,"SUmming up all the qualities of this movie, you reach the following result: zero! The lack of budget for this movie doesn't hide the fact that the script is laughable and weak; there's no history at all. Talking about getting scared watching this movie, I think only my cousin of eight-years old would be scared. THis movie is just the sick idea of some directors (I wonder how much beers they have drunken before shooting this picture)."
1,The movie for wasting your time,"The success of the movie was due to the hype built up from internet. From the movie making perspective, it is a rare success in terms of the ideas of exposing the movie to a point that people will go out and spend the money to see it and the money spent to make the movie. But, as far as the movie itself, it is nothing but child play. Glad that I saw it on dvd for about one dollar instead of the regular ticket price. So, it is the movie for you if you REALLY have tooooo much money and have nowhere to spend it. You have been warned."
1,OVER Hyped,"Nothing scary about this film (besides the money it made). It's a good idea but the movie seemed to go on forever (despite it was only an hour and fifteen minutes not counting the credits). People claim if you don't see the evil entidy it more scarier, well thats not true at all. And some people have the nerve to compare this to the Exorcist. I can gurante you this will never be a classic."
1,For shame... all a marketing ploy,"I still have a visceral negative feeling about this manipulative piece of tripe. I'm sure I'm not the only person who went into the theater under the impression that this was real footage of a real event; shame on me for falling for the marketing of this complete sham! Not only that, within three minutes of sitting there watching it, I began to get motion sickness because of the completely unnecessary jiggling of the camera. They couldn't even hold the camera still when they were interviewing the supposed ""townfolk"" on the streets of Burkittsville. And then there's the language. I don't know if they thought it would be ""cool"" to say the ""F"" word in every sentence, but I just found it thoroughly disgusting; I started to hope for the characters to meet their end. Congratulations must go to the folks who pulled in millions by tricking their audience. Worthy of zero stars."
1,This film was just terrible!!!,"This film sucked. It was not scary at all exept at very last two minutes. There were times when they would shut off their light on their camera and not hardly talk for a long time, and it was extremely boring. Even at the supposidly scarry time, the camera shook so bad and it was so much out of focus that you did not know what was going on. What they did at times, was not believable. Like when they found out thier map was gone, they argued for a long time like it would bring it back. Normal people would have kept walking, not just stood there. It was made to be an amature film, but they tried way to hard. This movie should not have even been made."
1,The lamest excuse for a movie!,"Don't buy it, rent it, or watch it. It is a waste of time. I wanted to choke the Heather Donahue character myself. I kept hoping something would happen to her just to shut her up. These three could get lost in a library and would be terrified by the books in the horror section. Any researcher I have ever read always goes to the area before any expedition is undertaken and gets comprehensive maps, materials, and interviews. The ""documentary"" will leave you in a state of confusion, they never really explain in detail what any of the local lore and legend has to do with the Blair Witch and the relationship to the hermit. This movie was given to me by a friend and I allowed my other friends to borrow it with a strong recommendation that they not watch it. Everyone of them agreed with me after they had seen it, they ended up in the same state of confusion and frustration that I did. I repeat do not watch this movie, you will regret it."
1,"Absolutely Awful Horror Movie,Such a disappointment","For all the hype Blair Witch had back in 1999 they made it sound good and people said it was creepy and frightening,Yeah right this movie is laughable that this makes Fresh Prince of Bel-Air look scarier by comparison and the way those teens ran around in the woods doing a so-called documentary.This no-budget timewaster is a completely unwatchable mess that has no plot and a bunch of bad words with even worse bad acting,no special effects or blood,no monster or killer.The only good part was the end if you could make it that far."
1,IT WAS LIKE KIDS GETTING SCARED OF SANTA CLAUSE,"THIS HAD TO BE THE WORST EXCUSE FOR A HORROR MOVIE EVER. I HATE THE SHAKY CAMERA AND THE WAY EVERYONE RAN AROUND WITHOUT REALLY DOING ANYTHING. IT SEEMD THEY WHERE SCARED BECAUSE PSYCHOLOGICALLY THEY WHERE DOING TO EACH OTHER. I HATE TO RIP ON THIS FILM BECAUSE I AM SURE OTHERS HAVE DONE THE SAME THING. RUNNING RAMPID IN THE WOODS IN THE DARK SURE WOULD SCARE ME IF ESPECIALLY IF THE PEOPLE WITH ME WHERE TRYING TO BE HORRIFIED BY THE UNKOWN. I DO NOT NEED BLOOD AND GORE BUT GOOD ACTING AND DIRECTING WOULD BE NICE. I HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED BY STUPID MOVIES LIKE ""PUMPKINHEAD"" AND ""KILLER CLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE."" I AM EMBARASSED BUT I AM AFRAID OF CLOWNS AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE SCARE FACTOR IN ""PUMPKINHEAD"" WAS GOOD BECAUSE OF THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE SURPRISE AND THE DIRECTING. I REMEMBER A REVEWER SAYING IT ""SCARED THE MESS OUT OF HIM."" I GUESS HE MEANT IT WAS A MESS."
1,Terrible movie,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and quite possibly the worst movie ever made. The acting is bad, the plot is nonexistent, the only positive is that the forest looks pretty nice, but then they filmed it in a real forest so that's to be expected."
1,DON'T GET SUCKERED IN BY ALL THE HYPE... THIS MOVIE STINKS!!,"I gave it one star and I was generous at that... Don't waste your money on this over-hyped movie. Watching three students lost in the woods and cursing at each other... (well, if you CAN see them with all the SHAKING of the camera) got tiring and very BORING. NOW, JAWS is a terrifying movie...one that still makes me stay away from oceans and deep water... NO WAY does this movie compare to Jaws...no WAY!!... ALL I HAVE TO SAY... IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE, DON'T! DON'T GET SUCKERED INTO SEEING IT!!!! IT WILL BE A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Yea, there are lots of people praising this movie, because they want to sucker you in to see this dumb movie so they won't be the only dumb ones who spent $$$$$ on this... MOVIE! I WARNED YOU!! STAY AWAY from it unless you can't get any sleep and want to waste your hard earned money!!!"
2,okay whatever,I thought blair witch was gonna be scarier than it really was. It was creepy but your mind makes it scary because they showed nothing. I did get kind of dizzy from the camera and all that hollering was riduclous.
2,3 Lost People...yelling at each other...BORING!,"I went to see this movie because of all the hype it got... and that is what it was just HYPE! It was different and sort of creepy but very BORING after 30 minutes. These 3 students get lost in the forest and yell at each other.... the camera SHAKES too much! My friends ended up missing most of the movie cause she had to run to the restrooms to throw up. I stayed throughout but should of walked out and asked if we could have seen another movie.I mean C'mon... three students lost in the woods with all that expensive video equipment, tents, food... but...NO CELLPHONE? This documentary was supposedly done in the 90's right? HELLO???? And yes this movie got mega bucks just like the BIG films do but it shouldn't have... They had a $40,000 budget on this movie... where did the money go? I don't even recommend this movie to be rented or bought."
2,Do not waste your money,"This movie was terrible. It was not suspenseful. It was not scary. It was annoying. It would make anyone with the slightest bit of motion sickness vomit. The female star had a terribly grating voice that one is subjected to listen to cry, scream, whine, whine and then whine some more. The most suspense the audience member feels is the wait to how long it will be before this female star is killed off. The Blair Witch Project hints at symbolism and irony and can't even accomplish the hint. It is some pseudo attempt at making something meaningful out of something lame and irritating. Caveat Emptor- Do not waste your money!"
1,"Too much hype, too little substance.","Yes, I ""get"" this movie. Yes, it was a great idea. Yes, I know what everything in the woods--from the pile of rocks outside the tent to Josh's kicking the pile of rocks to the handprints on the walls to Mike standing in the corner, etc., etc.--meant. TBWP was a well planned and well executed film, but I simply didn't think it was scary in the least."
5,Excelent,"I saw this movie three times in the theatre. This is the best horror film to come out in a long time. I didn't get the ""hype"" that everyone speaks of, and I fail to see how this film could possibly be a let down. I remember the reaction of the audiance after the movie, ""man, what happend?"", "" We didn't even get any blood!"" I stood up and said ""This was the best horror movie of the decade"". It's a shame to see that we have come to a point where special effects are all that the audiance comes to see. This movie made me think, and that stays alot longer then fancy explosions or fake blood."
4,Actually scary,"I suspect a lot of people who hated this expected either special fx or gore. Certainly, there is a lot of whiny arguing, and I disliked the characters. But this dislike managed to lured me in and let a sense of growing tension and unease creep in unrealized. At the end I was hooked, and had bad dreams for a few days since."
1,I would give it no stars if I could!,"I thought this was absolutely the most stupid movie I have ever seen! This wasn't scary. I spent the first half of the movie waiting for it to start, and the last half of the movie waiting for it to end....it wasn't ever interesting, and frankly I can't understand why someone would want to waste their money on the horrible film."
1,"Deserves a Special Oscar for "" Worst Picture of the Century""","The three salient features of this boring film are: boring, boring, and boring. A big disappointment... not scary, not funny, just boring. The worst film I've ever seen, bar none!"
2,The trailers show it all!,"If you saw the trailers then you've seen it all; the scary scenes are in the trailers beside the final one which was very disturbing. It could be a lot scarier and thrilling if well developped, It's really sad because it was a good material! So if you wanna buy a real scary dvd, buy The Shinning, my all times favorite."
3,Blair Witch,"This is one film that I just couldn't stop watching. I wasn't scared no I was terrified. It was just too real the ending will stick in my head for a long time. The idea is a good one but would I buy it no. The reason, I could not watch this film again. I seriously do not ever want to watch a film that affects me this much more than once."
1,What a Sleeper!,"This has to be the ultimate example of moronic, self-serving, drug-induced? paranoia being passed as public entertainment. Hey look! Mommy bought me a toy for Christmas and I can make movies now. Fear? What a joke!"
1,Not Scary,"I know a few people who were terrified by this movie, and I was all set to be at least creeped out, but it just didn't happen. It is a canidate for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 show. Really! While I watched it, I could only point out how stupid these brats were! Not to mention how annoying and whiny they are. Lot of cussing as well. Wasn't scary; wasn't entertaining. If you are easily frightened, then this may be a fantastic movie for you. If you have ever been in the woods and have 1/2 a brain when it comes to getting out of said woods, this movie will seem ridiculous to you."
1,Ed Wood could not have made a worse movie !,"This is without a doubt the poorest movie I have ever seen.I watched the entire movie waiting for something that never happened, and yes I understood it, it simply was no good."
1,proof of how marketing brainwashes americans,"i have no idea why everyone thought this movie was good, scary, or groundbreaking except to say that the people promoting this film did a very, very good job.the actors were horrible, there was no story, the ending was totally cliche, i felt absolutely no sympathy for any of the characters, and basically i was just sitting there looking at my watch every 5 minutes wondering when the movie was going to end. (oh, yeah, and i slept just fine that night except for being annoyed that i had wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this drivel)so the idea of making a documentary and having the kids go out and use the camcorder was different. it's not even all that original... has anyone ever heard of clerks?and just because something is different does NOT make it art. i'd give it 0 stars except i can't."
1,Blair Witch part 1 - Im glad there's a part 2,"One of the reviews here said ""If only I could give it negative stars"". I agree completely.This movie is seriously annoying. The handheld camera bit is one thing but the characters are just plain annoying. I kept waitingto actually see something...something...a flashlight shining into the woods. Thats it!Just when I thought it was getting better, it ended. An hour and twenty minutes of aggravation followed by ""wait, maybe somethings about to happen"" and then...credits. yeeesh!Go see part 2. Its much better than this."
4,Most of it shot as/by VHS Camcorder... Bluray not worth more,Great movie... I was excited to learn of it being released on Bluray. I forgot that most of it is acted/shot from an older camcorder... SD. If you listen to the stories of the interviews before they go into the woods... it is pretty scary
2,"Too much whining, not enough gore","If you enjoy seeing snot running down the nose of an obnoxious college student as she whimpers in fear, buy this video. If you want to see hyped-up, trumped-up nonsense, with no basis in fact, but this video. If you want two goosebumps on a scale of five, buy this video. The companion piece is a total sham and a waste of time, money and viewer's neuronal connections...it's all bull, with not enough gore."
1,HORRIBLE!!! BORING!!! For kids who giggle at the F-word.,I haven't met anyone over the age of fifteen who thought the movie was worth the time it took to see it. No plot; lots of yelling; mindless cussing and bickering.I can't imagine what this movie's marketing firm could do with a GOOD movie?
4,It Will Bring Back Horror Movies,This was one of the smartest ideas in movie history. It also paid off really well. Even if it was slow at some parts in the middle with all of the fighting. It actually brought a dying genre back. It also got people thinking on new and creative ways for making movies. Good job Artisan.
1,Not that good,"I may have felt a slight uncomfortableness in the last few mminutes of the movie, but other than that the movie did not scare me in the slightest. It could be because I was concentrated on my nausia throughout most of the movie. Somebody please give me forty grand and a video camera I'd like to become a millionare movie maker by shooting home videos."
5,I knew the whole story and still haven't slept!!!,My God--i haven't been this scared since I read Amityville Horror. It's a psychological mind set into fear. I was a little over the bitchingt but still have chills. Unbelievably surprised. Go now. U can't wait you'll hate urslf if u do!!!!!!
1,What's the big deal?,"This is one of the most boring movies I ever saw. After the first 20 minutes, it is the same thing over and over and over. Three kids walking around lost. Yeah, that's kind of sad, but the rest is just stupid. Apparently, all it takes to be an actor nowadays is the ability to cuss profusely with no style. This movie did not scare me at all, and I was extemely bored during most of it."
1,Brian Said it Best,"""It looks like it could be up north somewhere...maybe Vermont...the color is really washed out...not real sure what the're doing...the film keeps jumping up and down...nothing's happening...nothing's happening...nothing's happening...the movie's over. A lot of people look REALLY pissed!""Or something like that. Family Guy has more compelling horror."
2,"Wow, you read MY review out of all 600 reviews? Thanks.","Well this movie was quite amazing, however not original. Tons of indie films have done this. Heck, even you amatuer filmmakers have done it. However the BIG WOW is the HYPE that was generated. And how the hype made some people believe (Shall I dare say?) that the BWP was a REAL DOCUMENTARY! You don't say? The webpage was better than the movie, I thought. The Audio Commentary was interesting on the DVD. (Oh and to whomever says skip the DVD version...why? So you can have JUST the Blair Witch Project? Why not spend $10 more and get the Curse of the Blair Witch and the commentary?) Oh and the greatest part of the DVD, freeze frame in perfect picture quality that contraversial ending to see what really is standing/hanging/masterrr whatever in the corner. And mark my words, no one will really remember BWP in 5 years."
3,"Extremely hyped up, boring film! Pure Crap!","i did not like this movie. In fact, I could say that Im very close to hating it. What was so scary about this crap? The only thing that would make it scary is knowing that it's real, which we all now know it isn't, even though we were hyped up to believe that it was. We were all dooped into watching this piece of shot and thinking that its real. Even then, i wasnt scared. What's so scary about a bunch of people screaming and cursing for 90 minutes. It's just plain boring. The only reason this movie got three stars instead of one, was because of the ending. That does save the film somewhat. It actually gave me goosebumps. But hey, that was the last three minues. The rest of the movie is BORING. Avoid the hype and skip this at all costs if u havent alreay seen it."
2,I'm still waiting to be scared...,"It's not your typical movie...I agree with that. It's got some spooky moments...I agree with that, too. But scary? Not really.I'd heard people say they hadn't been this scared since ""The Exorcist""...which sounded like a promising endorsement. However, I have to admit I found virtually the entire production to be monotonous and boring. I kept watching only in the hope that I would finally get to the ""scary"" parts. Unfortunately, the film ended and I was still waiting. While parts of it were creepy (such as finding those stick figures hanging in the forest), none of it was truely frightening. Things became very predictable as the movie progressed, and I think the conclusion was obvious as soon as they saw that house. As for the ""realism""...are there actual people as stupid as the characters represented here? Now that's frightening!A good effort at trying to work ""outside the box,"" but I'm still waiting on the bone-chilling terror."
1,Scarier than 'The Exorcist'? I think not. . .,"This is probably one of the biggest let-downs in cinema. Hyped as being scarier than 'The Exorcist', it turned out to be nothing but bad videography sprinkled with a liberal dose of vulgarity. And the plot? Three young people throw away their map and walk themselves to the point of exhaustion in circles in the woods, crossing the same stream numerous times. Did anyone think to actually follow the stream downstream? I actually found myself rooting for the 'Blair Witch' at the end. Anyone that stupid deserved to be put out of their misery. As for being scarier than 'The Exorcist', as was claimed in many cinema reviews at the time of its release, this movie doesn't even come close. If you haven't seen 'The Blair Witch', do yourself a favor -- save your money and go see the re-release of 'The Exorcist' at the theater."
3,"Oh, my God...","I heard this movie was scary, and, it was, but I can't understand all the swearing. For example, I got on the site, Internet Movie Database, that the word F*CK, was used 133 times. 133 times. Wow. I think my neighbours thought I was having some sort of affair with my wife! The act with all the swears wore off pretty quick, and got annoying and took away from the reality as well as the quality of the movie.All in all, an average movie. Nothing too bad, nothin too good."
4,"Great technique, less than great plot.","Don't get me wrong...I did enjoy the Blair Witch Project, but NO film with that much hype ever lives up to the expectations. I do believe we were mislead as to the scariness of the film, but it did suceed in freaking me out on occasion. I think people who put down this film don't appreciate the technique (not to mention the genius behind the marketing), but I can understand their disappointment if they're comparing it to something like Friday the 13th.I think I enjoyed reading about the making of the film more than the actual film itself, but if you're into movies that mess with your mind, you should enjoy this one. The ending had one of those affects that didn't set in until much later...the more I thought about it, the scarier it got. Kudos to the director and our three stars...it was a nice break from your typical slasher film."
3,Don't expect too much.,"The movie could have been scary if we thought it was real. Since it was hyped up so much in the newspapers and television, a lot of people were expecting a gorefest and the same amount of trial violence. It is a psychological thriller but now that the surprise is ruined, the 'scary' effect just isn't the same. WARNING: If you hate excessive cursing and annoying useless bantering, don't buy this DVD."
2,"Bottom line:If your into three ***'s in woods, go for It.","One of my friends had seen it before me and was scared as hell.There was so much hype about this movie everyone was talking,critising,and imitating the Blair Witch.Even Jay and Conan O'Brian were making fun of it.When I finally wnet to go see it I was ready to get the scare of my life.I finally got scared at the last 5 minutes of the movie."
1,A sad excuse for a movie,The only types of peolple that could like this movie are those who are affected by hype. This movie makes you sick with the camera and a lack of good actors. This is the worst hyped-up movie of the decade. Save your money and don't buy this peice of crap.
2,The Hype Strikes Back!,"Although this film is cleverly thought out & in theory a great idea, it can be split into two easy parts:- (1) First hour and ten minutes: Tedious. (2) Last fifteen minutes: Great & scary. Worth a watch but don't expect to enjoy all of it."
3,Have you ever been lost?,"The shakey camera is the only real negative in the movie. When I go to the movies, I try to loose myself in the film. If you allow this to happen with the Blair Witch Project, you too will be scared to death. The terror of being lost and hunted continues to build yet ever so carefully. Enjoy this movie with an open mind and you will not go into the woods."
1,Waste of time and money,"An amatuer, and utterly unentertaining movie, even for student filmmakers. The distributors of this film are the only true geniuses, who managed to hype this movie as the greatest horror of all time, while a person can get more scared watching local news."
4,Low budget movie but.....,"Although the movie runs on a low budget I can only say its an amazing movie, Its packed with thrills and chills, there is no real gore or horror scenes but its full of creepy moments which keeps you alert all the time. For moments you will be in doubt not knowing if this is a real footage or just a made up thing. Simply its one of the most spooky films I have ever seen, I have it on VHS and I am buying it on DVD. In the end I can only say this movie is a one of a kind."
3,Orginal but not a personal favorite,I have heard very diffrent things about the Blair Witch porject. The critis loved it. Some of my friends hated it. WHen I saw it I did not love it. The camera goes all over the place and it is hard to fallow. The film is very origanal though. I did not like this film very much still it is highly original
4,Let's just give it a chance,"So, The Blair witch Project is a movie that splits people's opinions half. Sure, it's messy, cheap and badly produced. But when people say they really thought this had happened for real, doesn't it tell you something? I mean, it is quite hard to empathise with this film, and right after you've seen it you may feel a quite blank, but if you really concentrate to look at it, it is very good indeed. so, before you judge it, think of the value it has on indie movies. And stuff..."
1,WITCH HAZEL NEEDS SOME ART LESSONS,"I am ashamed to say that a friend of mine suckered me into buying this sad excuse for a horror movie. This was pretty much like watching The Three Stooges get scared by bad arts and crafts projects in the woods- without any intentional humor. I am fascinated by some of the reviewers mentioning this pathetic piece of drivel in the same sentence with classics like THE EXORCIST, HALLOWEEN, or THE SHINING. Now those movies did scare me, and even more recent movies like THE RING ( if you could get past the sorry plot ), and THE GRUDGE had some decent shock value, and for genuine creepiness THE OTHERS was pretty sweet. On the cheap side ( and by that I refer to budget only ) PUMPKINHEAD was very good."
1,that. sucked.,This had to have been one of the worst horror movies that i have ever seen. The production values were shit and nothing ever actually happens. Theres just a lot of the stupid girl screaming over nothing and thats it. I have no idea what the hell all the hype was about. You never even get to see the stupid witch.
2,THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN STARING AT TRESS FOR TWO HOURS!,"The whole appeal of this film as I understand is that it had you asking yourself ""What would I do if that was me?"" The only thing I thought when watching this film is ""Why did I pay to see this!"" The plot I must admit did have possibilities. If they would have made it in the tradition of ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" it could have been better. The photography killed the whole movie. The unsteady movements were enough to make you throw-up! The dialogue was insipid. The character seemed like nothing phased them. All they did was argue! I could of stayed home and watch my parents! Some points were interesting which is why I gave two stars. BUT AVOID WATCHING THIS FILM!"
1,boring...a lot of unnecessary script,"this entire documentary was totally boring, i saw this on dvd for the first time and i almost fell asleep in the middle, there are A LOT of cussing in the movie, like every sentence has at least 2 f words, which is unnecessary and made the characters SO ANNOYING. It's not as scary as people said it was, i'm a 14 year old female, trust me, i know if a movie is scary or not. but i thought the ending was pretty well thought out, but there were a lot of flaws in the movie, but i can't give away the movie, so i wont say it. However, this is a great movie to rent, not buy, because i promise you, you won't even want to see it again after a couple times, just gets boring"
1,Biggest Waste of Money,"I tried to give it NO stars, but the software won't let me...This was the most awful movie I have ever seen!Just goes to show you - hype works!"
1,WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER HANDS DOWN!,"The Blair Witch Project (1999)This is without question the worst horror film of all time and a TOTAL abomination to the horror genre.Trust me,avoid this like radioactive waste!!!!!! And you better believe me. I'm telling you the total truth!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Over-hyped ... for the Gen-ex audience,"Some good acting, but a disappointment in general. Doesn't liveup to the hype. Boring low-budget B movie. No fun. Pass!"
1,This Is The Worst Movie In The History Of Film,This movie is so hideously boring that I found myself counting how many times the F word was being used just to stay awake...and that ending was absolutely lousy...I won't even bother to go into the plot because there is none! I enjoy independent films very much but this was just horrible...no substance whatsovever...a word of advice to the directors if you're going to make a film on a $2.00 budget then you'd better come up with some really creative lines...a bunch of teenagers running through the woods spewing obscenities for no apparent reason is not a good storyline! Don't waste your time on this stinker! You'll be more entertained if you stay home and read the ingredients on a tube of toothpaste.
1,bad.,Highly overrated and not scary at all. I expected something better. mostly what you hear throughout the whole movie is some idiot complaining about seeing the same log over and over and over again.
1,Pathetic,"A tedious, motion-sickness inducing experience which does not scare or involve the viewer. Featuring annoying characters, an inexistent plot and a gaping hole at the end, this 90minute home-video details time spent alone in the woods and human reaction to ""spooky"" sounds and sights. This movie features a young women who is probably the most annoying character to ever grace the screen, who can only boss around her fellow campers for the first half, and becomes a sobbing, emotional mess for the second half. This is not a movie - it is a B-grade home video filmed by halfwitted university students. Avoid at all costs."
1,Give me a break!,"Last summer, I made the mistake of believing the hype and went to see this movie. What a dud! Not only wasn't I scared, it was painful to watch and might have been funny (especially the ""confession"" scene) had it not cost me six bucks. While the concept is compelling, the execution was botched: bad filming (I know its intentional, but its also extremely annoying), worse plot and terrible dialog. If you really have an urge to see an independent film, forget this and see PI."
1,TERRIB:E & BORING,A very boring movie that made me sleep after watching 15 minutes of absolutely boring nonesense.
1,"0 stars, HORRIBLE","If this movie was supposed to look like a true story they messed up so many times first of all you see heather putting on her lipstick but talking at the same time, then when heather and jim or whatever his name is are sitting down and no one else is there the format switches. This movie bored me to death it was not scary at all and it gets me mad that anyone could have did this. The actors had no true talent at all. The only reason anybody saw this is because they were mislead by it pretending to be a true story. THUMBS DOWN"
2,This movie was not scary and it didn't really have a story.,Well you can read this movie as you have read my title. This is not a scary movie at all. There is no plot in this movie it is just about these kids going out in the forest and getting lost while (supposedly) being chased by these witches. I give this movie 2 stars because it really didn't go anywhere. You didn't find out about anything and to tell you the truth it was kind of stupid. Many people liked it and I have nothing against that but if you read reviews before you watch movies take it from me.... DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. The last ten minutes is the scariest and even that is kind of stupid.
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!,"This was the most overhyped, unscary piece of rubbish that I have ever seen in my life. I'd have had more fun staying home and watching my toenails grow. I am regretting the hour and a half less that I have left to live as a result of seeing this movie.Myrick and Sanchez DEFINITELY created their own hype - there's no way people could actually believe this stuff was in the least bit frightening. The acting alone was good and believable though after a while Heather Donahue's hysterics become so irritating."
1,This movie is not as great as you might think,I heard the rave reviews and decided to watch it. Boring.....I about fell asleep. The ending was pretty good but the majority of the movie was pretty slow...
1,The Blair Witch Project,"This movie ""stinks"" and if you are one that likes the ""F"" word, then you will enjoy this movie......"
2,can i have my money back please?,This has to be the most overated movie I have ever seen. I will never watch this ever again....DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY...
1,Unwatchable garbage,"What's with all the hype? I saw this movie about 3 years ago, and it still remains as one of the worst films I'd ever seen. Local radio stations were blowing this movie out of proportion, saying it was a great thriller. I kept waiting for this movie to get scary, but it never happened."
1,absolute crap,I can't believe this movie actually scared people let alone convinced some that it was a for real documentary. This movie only goes to prove that people can be led by genius marketing and advertising. Girlfriend at the time swore that the movie was for real until I showed her a whiskey add showing the cast from the movie. I give credit to cast for turning their pile of crap into multi-million dollar franchise. Personally I glad that I didn't go to first showing at the base theater when it was released where I was stationed. Everyone came out of the first showing demanding their money back.
1,Worst movie ever,"I saw this movie years ago, then recently saw it again. It still sucks. Incredibly boring (I litterally was falling asleep in the theater the first time I saw it) with no story at all. 3 college age filmmakers search the forest for the Blair Witch and end up arguing the entire movie about which way they should be traveling. Only the last 5 mintues give any kind of suspense or thrill. Skip this movie. As a matter of fact, just burn any copy you see."
1,Blah Witch,"""Blah"" is how I describe this snore-fest. Bad ""acting"" no matter what the premise. Unwatchable camera work. And if only that girl would just DIE in the first few minutes. Ah agonizing movie to watch just because it seem like it'll NEVER end. Don't waste your time if you have shred of intelligence."
1,The movie isn't scary.,We went to see this movie on opening night right before they told us it wasn't a true story. It scared us a bit the first time we saw it because they said it was a true story. When I saw on the news that they told us it wasn't a true story I got disappointed by it and we changed our minds saying then it's not scary then. Only thing that annoyed me was too much bad language going on and a lot of people freaking out. The camera was shaking too and it was irritating but the movie sucks. Yeah it does look like a realistic horror movie but it's not true they sure lied to us.
4,Amateur is the key word,"For those who want to bag this movie, counting it out as totally amateur and for bad acting. I can only say it was never meant to be a high budget film, yet it made high budget film money. How can you explain that? How many movies have you seen lately that have received so much press and attention? Please don't say Titanic either, talk about gross. It is one of the best amateur, bad acting films I have seen in a long time."
1,What A Waste,"I love scary movies and I love to get scared...When this movie was over I was so throughly disappointed, I wished there would have been a money back guarantee, I would have asked for it. It was a total waste of money. I think one star was one too many!"
1,PAINFULLY BAD,"Movie is so bad that it wouldn't even excite ed wood if he was alive. Poor plot with even worse acting. Don't believe the hype. Whoever was behind the marketing campaign on this movie are the real stars. The only plot, if you can call it that, is some kids walking around the woods. Nothing happends. Painfully bad. No Budget films can be good - this is a disaster"
1,NG,"Is it scary? Not at all, I almost fell asleep during watching! The only true impact on me was the camera work which was so bad that it made me dizzy. I am so glad that I rented this one. I would strongly recommend you do the same."
3,A good scary movie if you've still got an imagination!,"I found this movie somewhat entertaining, but by today's standards of scary movies, it was a little weak. I simply feel it didn't live up to all the hype surrounding it (possibly because I have been exposed to too many of the gory knife-wielding- maniac-type scary movies). But if you are lucky enough to have not been desensitized by all that, then I definitely recommend you go see it. Even though I didn't find it scary in a ""don't- go-see-it-by-yourself"" kind of way, I admit, I probably won't be going camping in a very long time!"
5,This was the scariest damn movie I have ever seen.,"This movie started out O.K. but by the end I was yelling at them to get out. That last scene sacred the s*** out of me . When the girl finally ran down to basement ,while screaming . Well you know ! This was the best horror film I have ever seen.*****"
3,One of my top 10 horror films.,"Having camped in one of the Javanese ancient/haunted forests, I can sense the fear that plagues the trio in this movie. The desperation, insecurity, blames and the darkness are like echoes in my mind. While I don't mind the poor camera works, Heather is too irritating for me (that's why I omitted one star from the rate). The way the story reaches its' climax, although slow, is quite shocking. The ending could've been better though. I swear I saw a person standing in front Mike, before his camera faded out. Who the hell was that person, Heather?"
3,Not a favorite,I have heard very diffrent things about the Blair Witch porject. The critis loved it. Some of my friends hated it. WHen I saw it I did not love it. The camera goes all over the place and it is hard to fallow. The film is very origanal though. I did not like this film very much still it is highly original
4,Manages To Push Its Way To The Top,"""The Blair Witch Project"" manages to push its way to the top. Because the film is shot entirely with 16mm cameras (supposedly by the three filmakers who dissapeared), this causes the characters to be holding the cameras through times when filming would be the last thing on anyone's mind. And the girl is anything but an enjoyable character. Despite ""The Blair Witch Projects"" fondles, it is a genuinley scary and rather intriquing film."
2,WAY overhyped!,"Before seeing this movie, I was told it was the scariest thing since the Exorcist. Way wrong! It should scare ten year old girls, but most who see it feel the same. The creators depended entirely on the story( which isn't all that bad) to save a movie with inexperienced, underqualified actors. Don't waste your money!"
1,only school project level,"I could gave B+ grade if this is a school project, but that was somebody pay me to watch it and it was my duty to watch it and I generally want to gave encouragement to my student. But I still will tell them try to hold the camera still next time. Good job in creating this hype."
2,Boring,"I was very disappointed. I bought it for halloween and invited friends over. There were one or two points that were spooky but for the most part we had a chuckle. The ""campy"" movie I rented was more scarey"
2,About as scary as a rerun of Gilligan's Island,Imagine a horror movie where you never see the killer & the murders all take place off-camera. A true disappointment.
1,Scared of twigs? Don't see this movie,"If incredibly bad acting and lousy camera work is enough to scare you, BWP should tingle your spine or maybe that was your stomach about to lurch. This is a movie that offers up naseua as horror and no script to make it seem unpredictable."
1,Why is this scary again?,"It stunk, I went in to the movie hoping to be scared for days after, but as it went on , I kept checking my watch to see how much time was left for it to start in, but it never did. The only somewhat scary scenes are at night, during the day it's more of a comedy than it is a horror film. I found the casts fights amusing. I would suggest renting before you buy, becuase there were alot of people who thought it was great."
3,PUH-LEAZE,"I am 11 years old. I went and saw this movie and I thought it reeked in the scary department. Sure it was interesting but the guys who made it need to get creative. Sticks and rocks are not scary. I know you have to think about it to figure it out but I got everything and it still did not scare me. I live in a sort of country area and I read something about a 14 year old girl who could not go outside or sleep on her own after seeing this movie. Why is that? To all you people who were terrified think about this: Instead of running out of the theater screaming after the movie like some people were an 11 year old girl walked out laughing about how badly done it was. No offense but it was not scary! At least to me, but think whatever you please."
2,"It had an interesting plot, but could have been scarier","Well the hole plot with the mysterias legends were interesting. I think more should have been done to scare the vieweres. The movie was slow at getting to it's point. The limited information gave viewers the opprotunity to use their imagination, but I do beleave a little more should have been given. I liked the legend itself, but more should have occured in the movie."
3,The Blair Witch Project,"It keeps you interested in the movie, the whole time that you watch it. An extremely good movie with a brand new way of making movie magic."
1,:-(,"Well I must say - this film certainly does not live up to all the hype! The only reason I can see why people said it made them feel ill was from the camera shaking around! The scariest part of this film had to have been when my friends coat feel off the wall on to me! You spend the whole time thinking this is pants, and make yourself believe it'll be worth the wait since something 'scary' will happen soon! I'm still waiting!"
1,WHATEVER,"You gotta give these guys credit- they successfully managed to make millions and millions of dollars in their creative internet blitz to find an audience for this movie. However, for my money, I would never choose to watch a grainy, silly, shaky home movie about -- nothing? -- where people scream a lot, the film goes blank, and then the people run through the woods and scream some more. Idiotic and interminable."
3,"Not scary, but innovative!","I have to admit, I heard the hype before seeing it and I had high expectations,..you all know how that usually turns out! I am an avid horror buff and one of the die hards that think nothing scary was made since the Exorcist or The Haunting. Blair Witch delivers innovative and refreshing film making, but unfortunately, not too many real scares. I applaud the effort to follow in The Haunting's footsteps and create a film that includes the audience in it's creation by allowing us to use our immagination. This is suitable horror for the post-teen Scream/I Know What You Did Last Summer audience. It is fresh,exciting,and intelligent film-making, but don't expect to be jumping out of you seat."
5,This was the first...,"Please remember, you saw this movie just like the rest of the world. AND YOU WERE SCARED. Don't lie to yourself when looking at this movie. You saw it just like me and thought it was innovative and original. Don't care what anyone says this movie blew up over night and was the talk of the town. But for some reason after EVERYONE went and saw it, the haters came out and did what haters do---hate.i bought this because this is the first in its creation. Hand-held movie with a low budget with actors not so much acting. The director gave them notes as to what was happening, but as for the screaming and the terror that the characters encounter are all true. The director and sent them in to the woods and scared the cr*p out of them to produce what i like to think of as a ""true"" scary movie.Just remember this was the first of its kind...(present day follower: paranormal activity)Just has 'saw' was the first to create the new genera of shock horrorDon't discount the originals"
2,It couldn't survive outside of Sundance.,"This is one of those movies that's awesome in theory. As an independant film, it's kinda cool... but it's WAY too long and not particularly interesting. If you enjoy the F-word to no end and love to get motion sick, then you'd love this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this plotless, overdrawn atomie of a movie."
2,I was very very interested in seeing this film.,And Very Very disappointed when I did. Total waste of money and time. I gave it 2 stars not 1 because they succeeded in making people want to see the movie (so the extra star is for marketing). (by the way the only somewhat scary part of the movie is the part u see in the promotional trailers). Maybe I just missed the point; had it been a true story it would have been a different issue; but obviously it is not. I think the people who thought the movie was great actually thought that it was a true story.
1,Complete...,"This movie is nothing more than a modern take on an old horror movie from the 1970s called ""Cannibal Holocaust"".The main line from Cannibal Holocaust even says:""In 1979, four documentary filmmakers and their guide went into the jungles of South Americato shoot a film about cannibalism... They never returned.""Anyone who thinks this movie is at all an original approach to film making should stop watching Scream and get cultured on what a REAL horror movie is."
1,waste of time and money!,i heard that this video was scary.SCARY? Mickey mouse scares me more this! this is the most boring film i have ever seen in my life! take my advice.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
4,Good but not great,"This movie and the way it was advertised was true genius by the film makers. I know many people who actually believed it is real footage. I wish I had seen the film when I belived that it was real, it would have been ten times more scary and I doubt I would have gone outside by myself at night for awhile. I belived it was real because of the documentary shown on the ""Blair Witch"" on cable. When I finally saw the film, it still scared me somewhat. One of the things that scared me the most is how Mike was facing the wall like the children had been made to do. I could have definitely done without Heather though. I almost felt like cheering when she is killed because I wouldn't have to hear her stupid voice anymore. I know many people think this film is all hype, but remember this film is a small budget, independent film that was suppose to be seen by a small amount of people. So yeah people did make too big of a deal out of it, but it is truly amazing how well it did."
2,"In the woods, no one can hear you scream obscenities","Perhaps nausea-inducing, as the cameras won't stop jerking around for a moment, but hardly frightening, unless you consider being trapped with these three stupid, unattractive, and inarticulate people for an hour and a half to be the ultimate horror. Their arguments can be upsetting at times, but, really, who cares? Besides, the film has been overmarketed and overhyped. It's almost impossible to appreciate it as a film at this point. Next."
1,Boring......oh so boring,"I just saw the stupidest movie i have ever seen.All hype, but not one scare.I'll tell ya this though,if you like to hear pepole use the F word over and over again,go watch this otherwise pointless movie"
1,Absolute trash,I really wanted to enjoy this movie but actually fell asleep during the last 30 minutes. It is truly a waste of time -- save your money.
1,"You're kidding, right?","Just what I said. Horrible movie (I was actually rooting for Heather's demise!) but great marketing...some university should offer a class in how this movie was marketed, because it did scam a great many people into seeing it. It is clever, but in a rather morbid way--we go to see it for the same reasons we stop to look at car accidents. Personally, I'm still trying to get my money back from the theatre, so you can keep the videos!"
2,The most annoying movie I have ever watched...,"Don't believe the hype, it gives independant films a bad name. I have a hard time believing anyone over the age of 15 found this movie scary. I have an even harder time believing anyone might have thought this movie was real. The plot was unconvincing, one minute they were walking downstream and the next minute they were walking upstream (of course they would end up in the same place). The acting was pretty darn terrible, the girl was just screaming and swearing all of the time (I don't have a problem with cursing when it is used in context, but that was just overkill). There were some clever ideas, and the interviews with the locals were pretty good (so that saves it from being a total wash). Only see it if you have the time and money to waste."
2,All you lemmings pay attention!,"For those of you not quite bright enough to have figured it out yet, the story behind BWP is NOT TRUE! Agreed, the movie would have been much more exciting and enjoyable had I not known that the entire thing was made up. What annoys me most is not the film itself, but that most of you are just too stupid to go and find out for yourselves whether or not it is 'real'.Lemmings of the world unite!"
2,Yawn.,"zZzZzZzZz...er, what? Oh sorry dozed off there. Blair Witch was everything BUT scary. This is the most unscary movie I've seen. And there's no way I will buy in on DVD, there are hundreds of other titles I'd rather get first. Pass on this puppy."
2,Don't listen to the hype,"Movie is original, but completely overrated. Film is not very frightening and completely nausiating."
1,This was one of a waste of time and money,"All the hoop and hollar over nothing. Three people lost in the woods, being followed by a ghost. It just got more boring and I couldn't wait till the end was over."
4,If you go with an open mind then it is a great film,"After hearing mixed reviews from friends I decided to go to see Blair Witch Project at the cinema for full effect. After parting with my 5.20 ($8 for all you people in the US) I duly began to watch the film and thought it was a bit dull to start with. After I got round the fact that this could be a true story, and not just a film, I began to enjoy it a whole lot more. For people wanting blood and guts don't go and see it, but for those who want a more subtle horror then this is the film. It's not what you see but what you don't see that plays on your mind and gets you thinking. I was gripped by this film and once you get round the dodgy camera movement, it is probably one of the best horror films ever. The end scene is one of the best endings to any film I have ever seen; and for the budget this film gets near to the top of my all time favourites. Go see it with an open mind is all I say."
2,"pretty good, not bad","I think that BW is good for all the things that it's not; a Hollywood big budget movie, incredible special effects, lots of blood and gore. There are perhaps two or three truly intense, scary scenes but I think what's equally good about this film is the how the relationships between the main characters deteriorates as they become further lost in the woods.post scriptum - I think that there is no witch; I think either the fishermen and/or that dude who seemed to know alot about how the children died did it.post post scriptum - the cam work was so shaky that my wife starting getting sick and couldn't watch the whole film."
1,Looking In the Mirror With A Hangover Is More Frightening!,"Whoever says this movie is one of the scariest ever must be afraid of just about anything. The only thing that would set you on edge is the anticipation something was about to happen, but of course, nothing ever did. Unfortuately, most of the time watching this movie is spent waiting for something to happen. It's apparent that what this movie achieved was how a good marketing ploy can turn a small investment into a huge gain. If I'm lucky, HBO will show The Exorcist and I can record it on my Blair Witch tape. Then and only then can these two movies be compared. It's too bad the ratings stop at one star."
3,"It was good but too much ""Hype""","I went & seen the movie before it was released to come out here in CA. I thought that they should've had more details about what happened back in when the ""Blair Witch"" was around. It was kinda weird cause they where focusing on ppl's reactions. But, I really like the movie the first time!!! The second time you kind of knew what happened @ the ending!! I was scared out of my seat!!! Also the ""Hype"" about the whole movie in itself was TOO MUCH!!! It was like making the movie better than how it really sounded before you even went and seen it. I thought it would've been MORE BETTER but I did like it!!! Glad to see that it'll be out soon... =O)"
4,I liked this movie.,I like scary movies and I have to say that I got scared when watching this movie. I actually thought that this movie was based on a real story that happened to a group of people.
2,Too much HYPE,"As I am a lover of extreme thrills in many things, I thought (as the media projected it to be the world's scariest...) it would be great to watch it, but it was a total disappointment waiting till the end of the movie for a scary moment. NONE"
4,more than just a movie.,I have seen the Blaire witch 5 times and seemed to have noticed something different every time. maybe if the people that don't like it should have seen the movie about it on tv first called the blaire witch. It really made more sense to me after seeing this one first. I loved it and am looking forward to the video release. i saw them at the comic book convention in San Diego ca. and bought some really cool things. Even if it was just a marketing sceme it was worth it. someone did something right if they made that much money with only the little amout that was spent on making it.
1,I'm only sorry I couldn't give this movie a NO-STAR rating,"In my lifetime I have seen well over a thousand movies.My all time favorite was Casablanca. I have never asked for my money back until now. This movie was strictly bush, total hype, and non-scarry. I only wish I could hire the publicist because he deserves an Academy Award."
1,Boring and overhyped,"OK, so this film was produced on a low budget and managed to make a disproportionate amount of money. That doesn't mean it is any good. I bought it because I enjoy suspenseful movies, believed the hype, and I can now say I have learned by the experience! It is SO slow, SO tedious and the dialog demonstrates the value of having a good script-writer by its banality. It does create a certain tension, but my recommendation is rent this when you have REALLY reached the bottom of the barrel. I watched my copy once and wondered why, so I left it a few months and tried to watch it again. I failed."
2,"Overrated. Mostly a flat-liner, with a few blips of life.","C'mon people. THIS was supposed to be one of the best movies of the year? Granted, the acting was better than I expected, but the homemade effects really weren't very scary. The best part of the movie was when the characters' tent gets pummelled with what I guess were ghosts' fists. It was over-hyped, and it just didn't meet my expectations."
3,I disagree with Craig Fry...no offence mate.,"This is the simplest movie ever! The kids wake up, get lost, go to bed and get scared, wake up and get lost some more. You go into the theatre expecting such a mind blowingly scary film that you are almost creaming your pants already...when you come out, you are so let down that people have believed the film was so good. It is not a bad film, but it is not what you would expect...it's definitely a new take on the genre and will change how films are made... The hype was just hype and did not meet the film at least half way...clever marketing and publicity have made the film what it is...nothing more. Rent the film and save yourselves a few pennies...however, the ending was quite good..."
2,Not as scary as I thought it would have been.,The movie style was great. The ending left a little to be disired. I wish they would have explained it a litte better. And tied the loose ends of the movie together.
1,Why all the hostility?,"If you liked The Blair Witch Project, I congratulate you. You obviously possess an incredible imagination and intellect. But you must understand that many people did not care for it. It was not a genre-defining or life-defining event. It was a movie, nothing more. The reviews I have read by people who love this movie do nothing more than spew the same bile as the insipid characters in this piece of garbage. I didn't realize that a hack film could inspire so much psychoanalysis."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This was a box office smash. Why? I saw it in the theater after hearing good things about it, and let's just say my reaction of extreme disappointment is an understatement. The only thing that this movie left me with was motion sickness. Here's a quick rundown. Three people decide to take a trip into the woods to find the legendary Blair Witch. As they go about their daily duties, they eventually get lost. Their imaginations start to run wild, and they become convinced that the witch is after them. These are the things that scare them: piles of rocks, piles of leaves, and stick figures. Some people were scared by the fact that the characters just didn't know who was doing these things. You never see anything, or have any concrete proof other than legend and hearsay to actually believe there is a Blair Witch. You're just supposed to assume ""the witch"" is doing this. In conclusion, if rocks, leaves, and bad camera work give you the willies, you'll be scared for days!"
3,Clever choices make it work,"Three unbelievers trek into the wilderness in search of the infamous Blair Witch, and through a combination of irritability and ineptitude fall foul of the frightening legend. This low-budget gimmick film was hyped way beyond its capacity, so it's amazing that it still almost delivers on its promise. If you can set aside your motion sickness, the documentary style actually works. Along with the non-star casting and improvised scenes, it lends a chilling plausibility to a scenario which, if filmed conventionally, would be banal. These are clever choices: because it feels real, the film doesn't need a digital monster or any other kind of jaw-dropping effects to build a delicious suspense and deliver one of the most terrifying climaxes you'll (n)ever see. And that's what horror is all about."
1,It Sucks!,"This movie was not scary, the plot was stupid and the only thing it displayed was a low budget movie!"
2,Not worth the hype,"Well, I don't need blood, gore or CGI to be scared, but I do need more than three piles of rocks and some bundled sticks. The movie was unique, and for the most part the performances were interesting, but this was about as scary as an episode of The Jeffersons."
1,A movie about three people arguing constantly w/bad language,I thought this was the worst movie I have ever seen. Three people arguing and saying F--- for close to two hours!
3,This movie was a tremendous disappointment.,"I rented this movie and took it home with the intention of watching it after dark, alone, in the basement. I fully anticipated being scared out of my wits after reading some of the reviews like the one that said BWP was the scariest thing since the Exorcist. After sitting through the tape in its entirety the thing that I found most scary is that we have apparently become a society of wimps who would actually be frightened by such drivel. I am not immune to fear but BWP just didn't have it."
1,Only slightly more fun than watching paint dry,"Very interesting premise -- three filmmakers mysteriously vanish after lost a week in the woods, their discovered footage the only clue as to what happened -- completely undermined by trendy hand-held 'hey kids, let's make a documentary' style. Ultimately disappointing and frustrating. Too much running through the woods shrieking with no payoff at all. Now make the 'real' movie about this!"
3,This movie was initially average until the very end.,So yes 3 young students go to discover the mystery of the Blair Witch and get lost and tormented in the woods. But to me it never got very intense enough to be on edge until the last five minutes and the it's over. long story short it should have started in the middle and gave a little more at the end.
4,What you DON'T see stays with you...,"My sister and I watched this in her darkened living room... and it has stayed with me since. A review here, talking about whether or not it's a ""hoax"" um.... it's already been said it's FICTION. But well thought out and original fiction.... There is NOTHING like it out there right now. Forget all the slasher and haunted house flicks out there... this one will scare you for what you DON'T see, what your mind constructs around the facts and location given to you. ...and who said for sure it was an ear in that bundle of sticks? I thought I saw some teeth in there... thought there was some hair... my sister thinks it was a blob of intestines because of the Coffin Rock background. But that's my point... let your mind wander with the little bit that was shown and you WILL freak out. I don't buy into hype around movies, but this isn't hype... it's genius film making."
1,Better see the Discovery chanel.,"It's the most boring movie that I've ever saw. The Discovery chanel is more exiting that this movie. Please don't waste your money and time in this; buy a book, a CD, anything, but not this movie; The entire movie it's about three youngs, who get lost in the forest, and are kinda paranoic, they hear noises in the night (who doesn't?, its a forest), they get scary and screammmmmmm a lot."
2,"I'll STILL go in the woods, BlairWitch","Well, what can I say that hasn't been said already? Nothing, heh. I'm just not going to say the Blair Witch is awful and then leave... Well, to tell u the truth, I didn't find this movie spooky at all, at times it was boring & then it was fairly interesting. I can't honestly see how this movie can spook people out? Ohh yeah, tied together sticks & piles of rocks can be a real chiller, lol. But all in all, DON'T believe the hype! This is extremely overRated! Worth a rental at least..."
3,Is it a REAL story as I heard !,"I will give you an advice before watching this movie, DON'T watch it alone and be awaire that after watching it some seens of it will remaine in your memory for a long time. Three people going to the Maryland woods to discover something which nobody was stupid enough to do it before them and after they made interviews with the city people witch was like an advice to them to not go there.If they made a good plane and trained well about what they might going to experiance there and knowing their way in there very well, they would not face any problem if the wanted to escape from there, because of that they lost their life and they realy fail to prove anything to all of us. This movie is for ages 22 and above.I will give this movie 3 Stars in the middle becouse advantages and diadvantages for this movie are equal."
1,Everything below is utter lies....,This was the scariest film I've ever seen. I am afraid to go to the cinema again. This is because this film was so scary I had to hospital for a severe panic attack. I could have died. The stunning special effects were a masterpiece. The acting nothing short of oscar winning. The dialogue so complex I got lost in places. The only thing the film lacked was that amusing and lovable fellow Jar Jar Binks. However the huge size of the cast more than made up for it. As for the plot it rivals anything and even tops the Usual Suspects. This film is not an example of ridiculous media hype and Americans willingness to buy into that hype.
4,A good psychological horror film,"There was much hype surrounding this film and when I saw it I understood why. This is a very original film, very mature, realistic, a little frightening and had a good plot. This is now a cult film and will go down in history. Some people may not like the wobbly camera work, but it's still a cool film."
3,Well....,"Yes, I'll admit, it was scary, but an original premise? Sorry. Three words: The Last Broadcast."
1,"Boring, stupid, senseless, pointless, and idiotic garbage.","How dumb. How can anyone call this a great horror film? It sucks big time. The college students are stupid and uninteresting. The camera work is puke inducing. It takes forever for something to happen. The acting was awful, for it was just a bunch of dorkbags yelling the f word over 100 times at each other. A great idea ruined on the screen. Not recommended. Oh, and stay away from the sequels too, because they suck as well. If you want to see a real horror film watch Jaws (1 + 2), Alien (1 + 2), The Shining (both versions), Carrie (the original), Scream, Salem's Lot, Halloween, etc. Stay away from this drivel."
1,Total rubbish,What people see in this films beggers belief. The story is ridiculous and the acting is daft. I'd give it no stars if I could.
1,The Rip-off Project,"Is this movie a joke???!!I can't belive all the hype they had with this movie, it was boring and the scariest part for me was paying $12 to see it.If you want to look at close ups of peoples nostrils, then this films for you. Basic plot, teens get lost in the woods and wake up in the middle of the night hearing sounds outside (you would figure racoons, maybe bears), but it's not, it's some sort of witch who builds stone structures in front of teens tent, then teens disappear and the witch(who we never see) gets them all in the end. EVERYBODY IN THE THEATER BOOED WHEN IT ENDED!!!!!!!Ignore at all costs and go buy something like The Changeling or Amytiville Horror if you want to be frightened.Cheap budget or not, this was the biggest waste of film ever put together in the history of movie-making. It's been in the discount racks at my video store forever. ..."
1,Under no circumstances will I ever watch this movie again.,"I hate this movie with a fiery passion like no other. The movie is about a bunch of dorks who want to investigate some stupid legend about some old, hairy witch that is evil, but not as evil as the creators of this movie. The whole movie you watch a bunch of total idiots whine about how they're lost and stuff and scream obscenities at each other. It's like ""Beavis and Butthead go camping"", only Beavis and Butthead outwit these fools by a longshot. The movie is littered with bad special...whoops, I mean NO special effects and vomit inducing camera work (actually the movie itself is vomit inducing). There isn't a remotely scary part throughout the whole thing. This movie is a .... pressed onto a DVD and you should avoid it at all costs. Even the extras suck, judging from the commentary, the directors are complete morons, and the 40 minute curse of blair witch makes you want to flush the dvd down the toilet only more. Buyers beware."
1,Could have been so much more - a complete disappointment,"One of the most frightening films I've ever seen was a Sasquatch film in the 70's, which relied upon unseen sounds and a creepy atmosphere in a dark forest. I could hardly contain my glee when I heard the premise of this story. It just SOUNDED so good. The disappointment was crushing after watching this. I, like thousands of other people, was DUPED. These three wusses deserved whatever was waiting out there for them. I was rooting for their doom, as I couldn't take the whininess. It was horrible. I will say that the ending was intriguing, actually a little scary - but 3 minutes of fright DOES NOT redeem the idiocy that preceded it. On a technical note, what you see here is the video transferred to film version - NOT the hard videotape version, which I would have preferred to see. The muddy video-to-film look makes it all the worse for watching."
2,BWP - barely worth a peek,"Many said this film is so real and scary. It does feel real because it is soooooo badly filmed that it could only happen in the amaeture hands. If the director insists on the unfocused scenes to make it REAL then there could have been a better plot and more sensible dialogue without sacrifice its sense of reality. By finish watching the film, it makes me feel like a fool. Surely lots of films make people feel like fools by the end, in an amusing way. But this film is neither amusing nor scary. Simply distastful. I give 2 stars for its originality."
2,Not impressed w/ the witch!,"I went into this movie expecting to see a movie that was going to be a cult classic. Instead, it turned out to be the most boring movie I've ever seen...The minute it seemed like it was going to pick up, it was over. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie & if you really think that your missing out on something, rent it so that you'll be able to take it back."
3,"Kind of boring, wasnt scared until I was alone in the dark","To start off this movie definetely had too much hype. I saw it with my girlfriend thinking it would be a very scary movie. I was very dissapointed. It had a lot of umm points that would seem to lead to a climax then it would die down. I expected to see a witch or at least a figure of one in the movie, but I didnt see anything. The movie didnt really come to a real scary part until the end. The end was kind of good so it wasnt all bad. After I took my girlfriend home, and drove back to my place by myself thats when I started to really get scared. I imagined myself in their situation and it started to freak me out. When I got home and went downstairs to go to bed, I coudlnt help but play the last few scenes back in my head, and that really scared me. It wasnt what I expected but it still was better then what a lot of people give it."
2,An Unhelpful Review,"Shoppers appear to find only four- and five-star ratings ""helpful,"" and this movie has been reviewed so many times that probably nobody will read my review, but here goes:Overhyped garbage. Gets two stars for interesting concept, slyly promoted, but if judged purely from the enjoyment derived from watching it, the rating goes into negative numbers. My wife and I saw it in original theatrical release and it gave us both sick headaches.An ""Emperor's New Clothes"" element is at work here in how people who bought into the hype will not admit what trash this is."
2,Concept=GOOD Execution=WEAK,"GO pick up a copy of ""The Last Broadcast"" which surely predated BWP and may or may not have influenced these filmakers.This may be a good film if you caught it late night on the tube, without the hype- documentary styled thrillers can be very scary. This is a trio of goofus's emoting fake trauma in the woods somewhere."
2,DULL AND BORING anymore I could say?????,"I was SO looking forward to seeing the movie and when I finally did I was very disaponted. I had heard that it was the scariest movie, HELLO!! what kind of babies went to see that movie and called it scary??!!??!!.I have to say that it was 4 A fact the Dullest movie Ever made .Belive me if you want a movie to put you to sleep go and see ""The Blair Witch Progect"""
1,Boring,This movie was absolutely the worst film I've ever seen. They don't show you anything that happens to the 3 students. All you know is one of them disappeared and the other 2 went to a house and fell down. I recommend no one go and see this movie. It is a waste of MONEY!!!!!
1,The emperor has no clothes,This is the Pet Rock of film. The producers must laugh till they cry every time they're driven to the bank.
2,Why on DVD?,"If you buy this movie on DVD, you've got more money than brains. The creators would have killed to even shoot this movie on a digital format!A well executed concept, just not very scary. The story of how this movie was made is more interesting than the actual movie.Although it does have a happy ending -- there are 3 less film students in the world."
1,If only I could have given it negative stars.,"This movie was a terrible waste of time. Spare yourself and do something, anything, different. And by anything I mean go floss your teeth, mop your kitchen floor, clean a bathroom. You will be more entertained and you'll at least get things accomplished. I wish I had."
2,A Masterpiece of Bait-And-Switch Marketing...,"but about as scary as the stories you would hear Girl Scouts telling around the camp fire late at night trying to scare each other. Shhhhhh....what was that?!?!?!?! Did you hear that?!?!?! There, sorry to spoil the plot, but that's about it. A new urban legend, amaturishly filmed and weakly acted. As another reviewer stated, two stars for the masterful deception the promoters worked on so many unsuspecting viewers. That people are so gullible is the scariest thing about this movie."
1,"Dont buy this, go out and relive the experience","Dont buy this video, relive the experience! This is nothing less than someones idea of what it would be like if you took your dysfunctional family outing in the woods for a weekend. I wasnt so upset that I had spent money on this silly look at what could go wrong on a camping trip, I was more upset with the fact that I will never be able to recoop the 2 hours spent watching this drivel. This is a perfect example of what happens when people throw a lot of money promoting one persons idea of art. I dont fault the makers of the film for the hype machine, Hey this is America, Why not make a buck or two or millions. This movie will depress anyone who actually thinks that this is real and did actually happen. America had a practical joke pulled on them last summer and this was it! Dont fall for the hype and purchase this movie. This movie should have stayed underground! Buried about 6 feet."
2,too scary,"too scary for words . . . after this movie came out, folks in my household were forbidden from even talking about this movie in my presence. I am getting scared and creeped as I write of it now . . . gotta go and cuddle with my teddy bear"
4,Blair witch project,Wasn't as scary as I thought it would be but it was pretty great. I recommend it to people who like horror movies without too much gore.
1,Like to watch crap? Here's a movie for you.,I never heard of this movie and a family member told me it was scary. This was the worst moive i ever seen. I wasn't scared one bit.Instead of wasting your time whatching the movie i'll tell you what hapens. People walk through a woods looking for a witch. Cuss alot. lose their map. Get lost. Cuss Some more. Lose a guy. Find a House. Then die. Not much more than that. I wouldn't give this movie anything. But i'd give the makers a kick in the a**!
1,Pure Drivel,"Three film students set out into the Black Hills Forest to make a documentary on the legendary Blair Witch. Armed with a 16 mm camera, a Hi8 video camera and a DAT recorder, every step, word and sound is captured. After wandering around the Black Hills Forest, the students are cold and lost. Finally, one night after the last ray of light had left the forest black, they were never to be seen again. One year later, a bag full of film cans, DAT tapes, and video tapes were found. The behind the scenes video footage and the film, are cut together to make ""The Blair Witch Project."" What a stupid movie. I remember going to the theatre to see it. There was so much hype built up around this movie and I was expecting an extremely scary movie. Don't waste your time with this drivel."
2,Should have carried a cell phone,"There must be a conspiracy among some movie critics. The Blair Witch Project is a total waste of time - I mean for making the film. So the 3 film students are scared of the dark, and they cannot find their way back. What could be the worst that can happen to them, any way? It's hard to believe none of them carries a cell phone, either."
1,america's critic,"really was this any bit of entertaining, i was bored the whole time didnt see the witch it was plain out dumb!!!"
1,0 Stars If I Could,"This is the worst, most overrated movie of all time. Anyone could make a scarier movie with $20,000 and a video camera. If this was intended to be a comedy, it would get five stars. But wait, it's a horror movie. More like horror-able."
1,Hype about nothing,"The hype from the ""horror"" movie, ""The BlairWitch Project"" reminds me of the hype about the whole Y2K deal - all a bunch of talk. There were things said such as, ""Scary as hell"" , ""Scarier than 'The Excorsist'"", etc. I wouldn't go that far. In fact - I wouldn't go anywhere near that far. The story is clever, I'll give it that much, but there are many details that totally kill this movie. For one, every word out of the three teens' mouths was a curse, beginning in the letter ""F"" and ending in ""K."" I think that some people might find this offensive. Overall, this movie is a good waste of 80 minutes."
1,Oh yeah (yawn ...) very scary,"The scariest thing about this movie was that I actually spent the money to buy it. What silly stuff! People running around in the wood, screaming at each other, and when it finally - just before you drop to sleep - gets a little bit scary the film ends. Good viewing for sociologists: Shows clearly how many people can be fooled by advertisement hype!"
1,Watched it twice: still no thrill or scare.,"I watched this movie several months ago and thought it was stupid, so i decided to watch it again and try to get more into it. Still was nothing special and completely boring and stupid and this was not scary at all. People with good taste in horror movies would not think this is good or ""Scary as hell!"" as it says on the back. Would not recommend this to anyone."
2,My colonoscopy had more twists and turns,"It's a shame we don't really know what happens at the end because I would have liked to send a ""Thank You"" note to the witch for finally putting me out of my misery.Fabulous concept - miserable experience.PS: By the way, I don't care how frightened a person is... they should always wipe the snot from their nose if they're crying."
2,2.5 for it's originality,I hated this movie in allot of waysa but it's original and even if thats all it's got going for it it's worth a rental. i don't recomend it consistently but you should still try.
1,Worst I've ever seen,"After finishing this gem, I took it out of my VCR and destroyed it. This is the worst movie ever, and I have seen some bad ones (e.g. Humanoids from the deep) Bad lighting is just the start. The only good thing about this movie was the marketing, after all it got me to fork out 12.95. Save your time and money."
1,Doesn't deserve even 1 star,"Lots of profanity, extremely boring! Best watched on fast forward so that you can get through it quickly. I saw it some time ago, when people were saying that it was real, but never got around to reviewing it. From the minute that I popped it in the DVD player I knew that this was about as real as a Road Runner cartoon, but without the interesting dialogue. That's right, the dialogue in a Road Runner cartoon is on a higher intellectual plane than anything spoken by the idiots in this movie. The acting is bad, the cheesy black & white effects add nothing to this movie.This movie is well beyond being saved. If it was shown at a theatre with free admission, beer, coke, and popcorn it would still be a waste of time!"
1,not good and scary at all,this was terrible. its the worst movie ever. i wish there was 0 stars. the previews said it was the scarriest movie of all time yeah right there just trying to con you intio seeing it. i saw this in theaters too. waste of a perfectly good $...
2,Things I learned from this movie,"1- When people are running around in total panic they will still remember to film the action.2- Male film students have the patience of Job and will submit to a domineering idiot female for days on end.3- Male film students are also too stupid to hide surreptitiously throw away all the extra film, tapes and batteries and thus end the agony.4- Film students are to stupid to follow a stream downhill when lost in the woods.5- Film students are too stupid to walk towards the sun in the morinig and away from the sun in the afternnoon and thus walk East, out of the Appalachians.6- No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public. (Not an original observation.)"
1,What is all the fuss about?,"Don't waste your money on this trash. Better yet, don't waste your time viewing it. It is so amateurish and non-scary it is laughable. On DVD it's even worse because of the poor quality of how they filmed it. Get out your own video camera...you'll do a better job."
1,Titanic is more scary than this one!,"I've just finally rented this movie and was REALLY disappointed. The idea seems to be OK, but I don't believe that anyone who likes horror movies rated BWP as superb. The main problem of that movie is that you don't have reasons to be frightened. Woods are not too deep, trees are not too high and ""voodoo stuff"" is not too scary either. Students hear some strange sounds at night but I didn't hear anything really weird. In fact, it's really more frightening to walk around my countryside house at night!So, if you like horror movies, avoid this one"
2,"Yeah, whatever","Ok, that was cool. Annoying students gets killed in a forest. Now could we please get a _real_ horror movie? It's not a bad movie, but this whole ""most scary movie ever""-thing indicates an entire generation of movie-goers who knows nothing about films made before 1990. BWP is to Alien as grunge is to rock."
1,The Bored Witch Project,"Bunch of kids who don't know how to hold a camera ( it so shakey that it can cause the viewer to have motion sickness) film themselves going out in the woods despite what the town says of not entering those woods as legend has said that a witch lives there and no one has ever came back out of it alive. So we get to see running, screaming at the camera and no witch, eventually everyone dies at the end. It defiently on my top list of worst movies ever made."
1,SHOULDNT EVEN BE CONSIDERED HORROR,"THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING BUT PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND WITH HOME VIDEO CAMERAS IN THE WOODS OF MARYLAND SCREAMING AND ARGUING IT WAS STUPID AND NOT EVEN SCARY YOU DONT EVEN GET TO SEE THE BLAIR WICTH, AND IT HAD THE MOST DUMBMEST AND CLUELESS ENDING I HAVE EVER SEEN SO IF YOU LIKE MOVIES THAT LEAVE YOU WONDERING AND KNOWING THAT YOU WILL NEVER FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED GET THIS OTHERWISE DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT RENTING THIS CRAP THE ACTING WAS HORRIBLE IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY TO MAKE THIS SH$TTY A$$ MOVIE."
2,Gen X Hansel and Gretel,"That is really what it is. When you strip away the histerical screaming and shaky camera what's left is a silly fairy tale. Most of what happens to them is their own fault. The film shows just enough to be unrealistic as a home movie but not enough to explain anything. The repetitive whining made me want to scream ""Dude, we'll never get out of this theatre!"" Interesting idea but poorly done...."
2,Proves how low the horror genre has fallen,"The lack of good, original material for horror films is blatant with the popularity of this film, which is simply a low-budget idea that provides no scares and a lot of boredom, even at a short length. Not to mention it rips off a much better, though infinitely more graphic CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. (BLAIR WITCH, on the other hand, shows absolutely nothing to be scared of, so even the ending comes off as silly.) There isn't much to this film, and again, once all of the hype went away people realized that this film was a decent idea but not a very engaging feature. See for yourself though; the strong-of-stomach should try HOLOCAUST though."
1,The only thing great about this is the marketing,"Not terrible, just tedious. Since we all know that this is not cinema verite, is it cinema at all? The rough camera work and improvised dialogue are dull and repetitious. The ""supernatural"" doings are contrived and amateurish. What's more, for such a disingenuous project, there's no sense of humor. That's probably the most deadly thing about ""The Blair Witch Project"". As far as being hailed for its lack of special effects--well, Val Lewton had that nailed fifty years ago. I'd never thought I'd say this--but if this is the best work than can be accomplished on a low budget, give me James Cameron."
1,I've Got Three Words For Ya...,"Anyone who thinks this movie is horror, I've got three words for ya...TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE!"
1,An orgy of whining and cursing in the Gen X manner,I can't figure out why this flick was so successful. I'd rather watch my accountant's home movies.
2,Uh....that's it?,"Excuse me, but can someone tell me what happened here? The movie starts off okay but then it starts rolling down the relentless hill of, ""what the heck is this?"" I'm not a fan of gorey horror movies, but come on! This has absolutely nothing scary in it! They hear some cracking branches, find some piles of rocks, and some stick figure things in the trees that look like ceiling fans. Ooooh. Scary. I bet you that's where they got the idea for the Blair Witch symbol...somebody looked up at a ceiling fan and said, ""Hey. This could actually work. I mean, most people are stupid enough to buy into it."" As Chris Rock stated during the MTV Movie Awards, I'd also like to know where the people are with the other 30,000 dollars that it so called ""took to make this movie."" Hardly. Any moron with a camera could tromp into some ""scary"" woods and start filming like blithering idiots. Do the world a favor and burn this movie if you own it and if not, never ever see it."
1,"I wish I could give it ""0"" stars","This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, period! It is said that $40,000 was spent on this movie but I cannot even see how they spent that much. For those with a queasy sense of balance you should also steer clear of this movie since it will make you nauseous. This movie is NOT scary. It is horribly acted and the poor sound makes it difficult to understand what is being said. I must say the idea behind the movie was interesting but the execution was awful. Please do not waste your money on this ""hype project"" as you will be sorely disappointed. I wish I could have my $8.50 back (plus my date's ticket for another $8.50 and she almost vomited from the bloody camera shaking). In any case, you have been warned against this waste of celluloid."
1,"Not even a ""FAIR WITCH PROJECT""","This movie is a joke. The story line had promise, but it is so unrealistic. The campers didn't even have a good hunting knife or proper provisions. ""City kids!"" And what movie holds the record for saying the f-word? Don't waste your money. ""Scream"" looks like an Oscar winner next to this trash."
1,This is the worst movie ever,"OK, I bought the movie and i just finished watching it...my stomach hurts and i am angry at my wasted money. The movie is NOT scary whatsoever and the whole thing is a shaky camerad peice of garbage! Most of the movie was spent between the three arguing with eachother."
1,Blah Witch Project,"If you know the secret (not so secret anymore) than this film is a waste of time and money. If it looks like they spent money only on the cost of tape, film and camera rental making this... it's because that's exactly what they did. A good film to hoax anyone with who doesn't know the secret (and I'm not ruining it here, because, if you do buy this film, the secret is the only endearing thing). We did this to an ususpecting friend with amazing results. So, with regards to its party favour possibilities, we could say this film is a 4 star deal. But, standing on its own merit alone, this is one of the worst movies ever made."
1,STUPID HOMEMADE VHS MOVIE!,This homemade VHS movie is nothing! Unless you have plenty of time to waste!
1,blair witch...,"this is the worst overrated movie i have ever seen, the critics were either not paying attention or were high when they reviewed this movie. This movie is not worth renting, not even worth seeing on tv. The acting is poor, most of it seemed to be improvisational, why the hell did he drop-kick the map into the lake? It does not even deserve 1 star! don't rent this video!!!"
4,For a fact,"I liked the movie. But there was one thing the matter. It wasn't real. I mean Heather was on 2000's Boys And Girls. And Josh was on 2001's Men Of Honor. I mean the Rustin Parr story is real, Elly Kedward story was real, but this isn't real. Theres no such thing as the Blair Witch. Burkettsiville isn't a scary town, its where people can rest the dead. So stick with Blair Witch 2 first then check it out. This is HJ. Peace Out."
4,Everything you would expect from a dodgy video camera!!,"Hysteria! It's not what you see, it's what you dont see. So for all you ungrateful people out there; would you camp down the woods after watching this film i do not think so? If this is not the case; then you are really warped in the head. If you have not seen the Blair Witch, watch it, and if you have seen it see it again, and understand the film."
2,It's Just Crazy White Kids Lost In The Woods For Two Hours,"I saw this movie once with my boyfriend Tyrone and three times with his homeboy Eddie. I thought I was gonna be really scared the first time. It's like two hours of these crazy white kids lost in the woods. They never really find a witch or nothing. After the third time, I hated the whacked out white girl with the plump cheeks and that grating voice. Man, her voice sends chills down your back. She's the scary part. No, but I give it two stars for effort. But it just ain't scary at all. No way. It's just crazy white kids lost in the woods for two hours. No lie."
1,Don't Bother!!,Yeah...great photography...if you like watching 90 minutes of leaves and trees!! This movie is a total bore and is a complete waste of time! To compare this movie to any other horror movie is an insult!
2,Great Gift-wrapping - but nothin' inside.,"The hype was ingenious. The ""background"" posted to the net was brilliant. The free publicity, via the talk shows, newscasts, and magazines, couldn't be bought for a king's ransom. I award 5 stars. But the movie? Promised way more than it delivered, made me nauseous, and irritated the hell out of me with its non-story story. As for the movie, 1 star to the idea guys for getting out of bed each day and working at something and 1 star for hustling a lot of money out of us unwitting dupes."
3,It's ok...,"I saw this movie, expecting it to scare me out of my mind like everyone said it would. What I found instead was a shaky, potty-mouthed, slow film. It actually put my friend to sleep! I'll say this in it's favor though, it was a pretty good idea. The main problem is that it seems to drag on forever without anything interesting happening until the last 5 minutes or so which go by fast and left me confused. All in all, it isn't horrible, but it isn't as great as I thought it would be."
3,Rent it once -- don't buy it...,"Yes, if you saw it in theatres you were probably impressed that you could get that creeped out without so much as even one drop of blood or hatchet being swung. That's the best part of this film, since most viewers knew it was just a mock-umentary of three kids searching for a witch in the Maryland woods. The fear is totally self-induced. It's all in your mind and in what you IMAGINE is out there. It doesn't rely on slasher gimmicks to frighten you.It also struck me as impressive that no music is used and yet we still felt the terror build up throughout the film.Downsides: the profanity is a bit overdone, (I mean, people curse, but hardly THAT much!) and Heather's bossiness gets obnoxious after a while. I'd say rent this once even if you saw it in the theatre, just so you can answer any questions you had after the first viewing.Bottom line: This is NOT the kind of horror flik you will play again and again. Once or twice is more than enough!"
3,actually enjoyable once through,"So many people go into this film expecting the wrong things. No, it is not really that scary. No, it is not masterful film making (it never claimed to be).What it is, though, is highly original. It is what horror in the '90s needed, a dose of originality instead of more Scream ripoffs. In the end, the film doesn't work as well as it could have, but it is so original you will probably enjoy it at least once.I think most people either hate or love this film. I was oddly in the middle. I enjoyed it the first time, but I doubt I will ever watch it again."
2,disappointed,I've found this movie very bad! I was sure that it was a very frightening movie but it's not the case! it's very slow and very SHORT. Much ado about nothing...
2,The most annoying movie I have ever watched...,"This movie was more hype than substance. Everyhting about the acting, and attempted ""real life feel"", was so bad it was laughable. The profanity was completely overacted and out of context. It was not believeable in the least (pay attention to them following the river, anyone would know better than to think that they were ""lost""). There were some interesting concepts and the interviews with the ""locals"" was pretty good (so that is it's only saving grace). Only watch it if you have two hours and $3.50 to waste."
1,Why can't I give 0 stars??,"I waited a year and a half and finally caught this on cable. Well, that's 2 hours of my life I'll never get back..."
2,Cedibility of characters' behavior the real problem.,"If this were a REAL student film project and no more than 20-30 minutes long, I might give it a B+! I stuck it out to the end just so I could say I had watched it all. Problem? Credibility of their actions--they are supposedly intelligent young people. On the 2nd (or 3rd?) day someone has the bright and practical idea of following the sizable stream they are by DOWNSTREAM! Why not! Of course that would have led them to nearby civilization. But instead they keep screaming f**k at each other (268 times actual count?), going in circles until the end."
1,"No Frills, No fear, lots of Yawns....",This is absolutely a waste of money. Some kids go out into the woods with a camera and come back with what is a really lousy film. It isn't scary. It isn't funny. It isn't pleasant to watch. I do not mind new styles or experimentation in filming. But this does not work. Only good point is the very end...if you remember...but what it has to do with a witch.... Nothing. Save your money.
1,The Blair let's B!tch Flopject,"This movie is neither shockingly candid nor well improvised by the actors....to sum it up, i could eat a can of Kodak and puke up a better film."
1,it was crap i do not recommend it. I think it is for old men,The Blair witch project is mainly about Tony Blair and a witch doing a project to hand to there teacher befor the end of term if they dont they will get a detention.So basicly the story is about Tony Blair and a witch doing there project befor they are totally screwed. At the end Tony Blair loses to John Prescott in the election and the witch gets hanged and they live hapily ever after ......................... ? or so they thought dndndnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!
4,not scary enough,"I OPENED MY DVD WITH DELIGHT READY TO BE SCARED WITLESS(bearing in mind the film isnt released here in england until halloween)AND WHAT DID I GET?TO BE HONEST A SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE FILM, OK BUT NOT GREAT.THE DVD LOOKS GREAT,SOUNDS GREAT ALL THE EXTRAS WERE GOOD BUT I CANT BUT FEEL A LITTLE LET DOWN BY ALL THE HYPE"
5,Great Movie,"I was terrified when I saw that movie. i live out of town with a lot of trees around and I didn't want to get out of the car. It was a great movie, even though I still get scared at night. I think about that movie every single day. I even sleep with y lamp on now. That's how scared I am. Even though nothing happened in the movie but the fact that they were being followed and the witch knew they were there was scary enough for me. It a movie everyone has to see."
3,Pretty scary,"""The Blair Witch Project"" was pretty scary considering the low budget. A lot of my friends didn't like it, they didn't think it was scary, but I did. I think the reason I liked it more than they did is because it was like a documentary. And I like documentaries like that. I thought it was more creepy than scary. Especially at the end when they find that building. And the fact that it was filmed 30 minutes away from where I live, that's really creepy."
3,A good home movie that somehow got into theatres,"This is a good movie, aside from the fact it's utterly un-scary. There are some serious continuity flaws in the movie, like:If this is the footage from their shooting, why is it edited and interspliced between the digital and 16mm camera? Is the Blair Witch a film editor?Why do they run out of food first instead of battery power? They're constantly filming.How did Josh scream without his tongue?"
4,This is something that your kids should not see before bed.,"If you are the type of person that remember walking alone at night or just by yourself and remember the little noises that shakes you up and give you that erie feeing, the Blair Witch does it all. It scares you so badly that you think that you are actually there yourself about to die. It is so good that you don't want to be alone at all. This movie also test how much pressure your heart can take when something just happens out of the blue. The acting was so real that you feel as if you are there yourself. But as for as the movie goes, it is one that you'll buy and watch with a group."
5,Best Ending Ever!!,"Oh My Gosh! If you haven't seen it yet, go get it Now! This movie was quite possible the scariest movie I have ever ever seen. I'm too scared to go camping anymore!! I'm buying this baby for sure!"
1,Someone should drop a house on this witch,"Great Marketing appears to have drawn the crowd to see this one. Blair Witch offers a creative cinematic perspective however this movie gets lost in a most boring sequence of camping events and one highly annoying female character. The acting is horrible and the plot nothing more than overreactive hysteria to a bunch of freaky nonsense and mind games. The ending is somewhat scary without alot of special effects..but not nearly as scary as it's hyped out to be. I have seen some very creative and scary films without the violence and splatter ... unfortunately, Blair Witch is not one of them."
1,What's the Fuss??!!,"I finally rented this video and it was one of the worst films I've seen in recent memory. I cannot believe the hype and positive reviews that it has received. The female lead over-acted throughout, she ruined it! She was answering or asking her next questions before the person answered. Ridiculous, boring, not worth the time or $4.19 that Blockbuster charged me."
2,The only unbiased review you will see here...,"I'm sorry I fall in the category of ""dont know what all the hype was about"". I gave it two stars for its originality - but it was overrated. I didn't find it at all scary - in fact if you want to see something really scary, come clean my Refrigerator!"
3,Scary? no way - maybe im missing something?,Well i watched this film on DVD yesterday - it has only opened in the cinema over here this weekend (Ireland) so thankfully we have missed most of the hype. Well i must say i was dissapointed overall - it really didnt have any scary moments (i mean some episodes of buffy the vampire slayer has had scarier moments than BWP).However it is a well constructed film and the host of extras on the DVD make it worth the money.
1,Eighteen Minutes,"On my copy of The Blair Witch Project, there are fifteen minutes of commercials and trailers before the feature. Then, there are eighteen minutes where they discuss the topic of the title, The Blair Witch. After which we get over an hour of ""We're lost"", ""The map"", ""Your Fault"", ""Go South"", ""The map"", ""We're lost"", etc. And that voice of that girl! Argh!"
3,Great movie but....,"Great and unique movie but the biggest drawback about the movie is that it's real boring if you watch it more than once. The impact is totally lost. You later realize the movie wasnt THAT great, but it was very original."
5,BLAIR WITCH ROCKS,"i LOVE this movie. Finally a movie that breaks all the rules makes it big. Anyone who doesn't think it is scary is eithier so desensitized to horror thaks to movies like ""Scream"" or hiding something. This movie should get all the praise and awards possible, since it is the only thing out right now that deserves it!"
5,Psychological terror at its best!,"This movie makes you so afraid of being alone in the middle of nowhere that you want to stand in the middle of traffic when you finish watching it! The creepist movie I have seen in a long time, because you never actually see what it is that is tormenting them. The scariest parts are the screaming at night, and at the end, when you see Mike against the wall . . . Be prepared for a gut-wrenching (literally) and heart-pounding movie."
1,A Mockery,"This supposed film is not suited to even be discussed unless warning others not to watch. I was so disgusted with this film. The producer, writers, and wanna be actors of this film should be banned from the industry altogehter. There is no second chance for this group."
1,Please dont buy this trash!,"This movie contains the worst attempts at acting I have ever seen. The story was equally as horrible. Almost the entire movie is spent with these three idiots arguing about where they should go, instead of getting there. The directors did have a good idea though: ""Lets make a cheap movie, hype it up via the internet, and see how many cattle we can get to come see our movie for 7 bucks a pop"". It was one damn good marketing scheme, and made them tons of money; whether or not it was their plan to do so, they certainly do not deserve it."
2,evil dead ripoff,"a fair horror film at best, the blair witch project is cheap ripoff of ""The Evil Dead"", the original spooks in the woods movie. forget this and see Sam Raimi's masterpiece (a.k.a. the ultimate experience in grueling terror)"
3,Very Realistic,"First things first i agree the movie wasnt all that good, it did lack alot in the beginning. But what it lacked in the beginning it made up for when the college students got to the woods. This movie isnt like other horror movies, where the charcter isnt scaried and is trying to kill the witch/vampire etc. In The Blair Witch Project the characters are very realistic meaning they act like what we would act like if something like that was happening to us. So the moive doesnt seem fake."
1,TOO MUCH HYPE!!!!,"To tell you the truth, this movie was pretty bad. Nothing made you stay back and think for a while. It was a relief to get out of the theater. I feel stupid and cheated on wasting an hour and a half for some movie that just nauseates you."
2,"Good plot, creative, stupid movie.","I have mixed feelings about this movie. First of all I think the plot is WONDERFUL, VERY creative. The bad part is that they cuss to much, every word was a swear. Also, it was boring and overal not a fun movie. Probably the biggest reason for my mixed emotions about this movie is that the commercial missled me into thinking this was a classic horror movie, and this is far from a GOOD classic."
2,"Overrated, disappointing, yet it could have been great!","The concept behind this movie was basically raw is better, and raw leads to realism. This movie was filmed with a not-so-professional camera in order to add a natural, uncontrived feel. This would have worked if the script were a little more developed. Natural is not cursing every two seconds. I mean they couldn't say a sentence without throwing in about five curses and blaming each other for being lost. There were a few suspenseful parts, especially the end but for the most part the horror was lacking. They tried to go for the whole mental breakdown thing, but it did not succeed. Great idea, however this overrated flop only attempts to scare you with it's colorful language."
1,THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!,"The characters in this awful movie were so loud, vulgar and rude that I couldn't have cared less what happened to them. The whole thing came off as amateurish, ridiculous and TOTALLY NOT SCARY! A complete waste of money and time - BOO, HISS!"
1,Completly Over Rated.,"The Blair Witch Project is just another over hyped movie. The movie critics are so eager to review anything that is slightly different from the typical hollywood movie resepie, that they automatically praise anything that breaks the mold. This movie was dull and unentertaining. See it if you like, but I was throughly dissapointed."
4,They are not exaggerating when they say scary as hell.,"It was not like the Hollywood movies where everything is fake and it has a good ending, but it seemed so real. You have to pay attention and piece things together to get the real effect. This is by far the scariest movie I have ever seen and now I think I can watch anything. Even though it didn't take much money to make it, it's a good movie that will make you sleep with the lamp on. You may not want to go camping for a little while."
3,Utterly Disappointing,"Why does it deserve 3 stars?Because if I gave it any less I wouldn't be giving credit to the actors who actually tried to make a good horror film. This movie was not one bit scary,it was boring,it was nauseating,it was repetative,but not scary. I have an aunt who can be easily scared,and she never slept better that night! I never slept better that night! I honestly thought the Little Mermaid was scarier. Another thing.I'm no big horror movie fan,haven't seen many,but if this is any representation of what that genre is like,then count me out.I want to be scared,not amused. Before the movie began there was a preview for ""Stir of Echoes"". That stayed in my head that night.2 minutes of preview did more for me than 90 minutes of ""Blair Witch"".""The Sixth Sense"" is horror movie of the summer. Only good part is the ending,the ending freaked me out a little,and it probably would affect me more if I was camping. Otherwise,don't waste your money on true hype!"
4,Scariest movie since THE EXORCIST!,This film shocked me. As it is this really isn't a film but more or less a documentary on the Curse of the Blair Witch. It seems that people either love or hate this film but its still worth the look.
1,Terrible!,"This movie is awful. There is unnecissary swearing, and terrible filming. It was terribly boring. It just started to get a bit interesting at the end, but then the movie suddenly ends unnexpectedly. To think of all the money that this movie made is the only scary part. If you were planning on seeing this don't!"
5,The Most original idea in a long time....,"I very much enjoyed this movie. Was I scared, NO. But I did appreciate the type of suspense, by not knowing or seeing what was out there, that was brought out in the film. In an era of BIG budgets and costly special effects this movie was quite refreshing. I recommend it highly."
3,Using Windows is scarier than the Blair Witch Project.,"One positive about this film is the fact it does seem like a real documentary. Another is that the characters finally stop whining and crying at the end. Though the friend I went with (her third viewing) was terrified (her word) the first time, for me giving up Linux and going back to Windows would be scarier."
5,Be prepared to think yourself scared......,"It is not as if this film were bloody, violent scarey, however, your mind can spin you into something that will make you turn on all the lights in the house, and peek around every corner. I'm not a person who gets easily scared, especially at a movie, nevertheless, after seeing this film, I held my bladder until the morning, and even then I ran..."
1,The Blair Not Scary Project,"Everyone knows this is supposed to be more a psychological thriller than gore-fest, but it still fails. 2/3 of the movie has the three main characters screaming at the top of their lungs.....at each other, at the witch, at the creek. If I was that scared for that amount of time, I would be too weak with fear to scream that much. I appreciate what the film tried to do, and I admire the creativity in its approach, but all that annoying screaming never amounts to anything except a lame ending where Mike is standing in the corner in accordance with the legend.....give me a break!"
4,Original Horror,"Some won't like it because they need to ""see"" what's spooking them in order to frightened by a movie. But for those who know that what we don't see and what we hear can truly set our imaginations ablaze with fear, then this is the DVD for you. A very original idea pulled of perfectly. The DVD has a lot of extra's that you will enjoy. But I suggest that you watch ""The Curse of the Blair Witch"" first then the movie. It will increase you knowledge of the legend thus making the movie even more effective."
5,Is it live or is it Memorex?,"I went and saw The Blair Witch Project before it went into wide release, and had several people tell me and eventually convince me that what I was seeing was actually true footage - that these three students actually did lose their lives in the forest after being tormented for three days. It was this aspect that truly terrified me. I can honestly say that I have NEVER been more scared than during that final scene. The thought that what I was watching actually happened is what truly frightened me. Once I realized that the movie itself was ""fake"", I revisited it and wasn't nearly as scared. Still, I will never forget cowering in my theater seat and feeling my heart in the back of my throat during that first screening. Cudos to the makers of such an original film, and to the marketing team who presented all the advertising so effectively."
5,This movie scared the crap out of me!,"I lost sleep for three days over the Blair Which. Because everyone i talked to said that it was real. The three kids where real and they really got lost and they really died like that. I tried to forget it and get some sleep and thats why i had to get online and find out the truth about it otherwise I would still be terrified. I felt real dumb and real releived that it was ""just a movie"" The kids and the producers deserve alot of credit for this movie cause its one of a kind."
5,Fear is in the eyes of the beholder.,"I'm sure everyone has heard conflicting reviews of The Blair Witch Project, ranging from ""dumb"" and ""nausea inducing"" to ""the scariest movie since the Excorcist."" In my humble opinion, the reason for this extremely wide range of opinions, is that the movie's ability to scare us depends on our ability to let our own mind fill in the blanks. That's whats wonderful about this film. It gives us a terrifying premise, and allows us to incorporate our own worst fears and scariest ""boogiemen"" into the darkness we see. For those viewers (and there are many) who are fortunate enough to have an imagination which complements this unique ""mockumentary"", they are rewarded by a truly frightenening movie experience that few films can rival. I would recommend this film to anyone just on its premise alone."
2,How about the Blair Clown Project,This turkey was the most over-hyped movie I've ever seen. Scary? You've got to be kidding. First of all how did these morons get lost in Maryland???? My backyard has more dense vegetation!!!! The setting didn't help this movie. Eventhought the storyline was original the movie didn't scare me at all. At times I found the characters annoying and not convincing. The ending was predictable and a major disappointment. I will not add this to my DVD library.
4,Great Horror Flick,"Ok- for all you people who think that this movie was stupid, I have somthing to say. I don't think that any of you know how to appreciate good movies. I think that this movie is great, in fact i'm going to buy it tomorrow @ blockbuster, so i think that this is the kind of reveiw that you want someone reading. I think that it was very well written."
1,"hype, hype, and more hype","I'm glad I waited for the video rather than wasting my money at the movies. What a waste. The only thing I thought was decent was the acting. I thought the kids did an ""ok"" job making you believe they were lost and scared. other than that, I thought it bombed big time. The ending was a huge dissappointment. It was basically alot of nothing. I can't understand why anyone would think that this was that scary. I found myself waiting for the scary parts, but they never came. I'm not a big horror movie fan because I think most of them are just slasher flicks. However I do appreciate a good terrifying movie once in a while but this is definitely not one of them. Save your money. By the way, for those of you who think that this was a true story, one of the actors was on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee. It was not a true story."
1,The most Over-Hyped piece of Tripe I've Ever Seen!,"This was just a horrible movie that made my date suffer from motion sickness from the choppiness of the film. The idea was cool, but the execution was very poor and not in the least scary. The ending was also very disappointing. I give credit to the people behind the film for creating a lot of hype around the film which tricked everyone into seeing this waste of celluloid. The shame of it is that there are plenty of other independent films that deserve this attention.Final advice: Avoid at all costs and spend your money elsewhere! You have been warned!"
4,The Blair Witch Project,"Ok so now everyone has seen the good and the bad topics about blairwitch, and you know what? It was both. The story line i feel was great, needed to be more in depth and scarry. But the acting sucked bad. Heather was a total disappointment, with all her crying and screaming and stuff, and josh and mike were the typical male tuff guys. But over all the movie was well layed out except for all the people having to leave the movie theater beucase they were motion sick. I think if you guys are to come out with a new blairwitch movie, go more in to real life, get some special effects, get some experienced actors, most of all make it more scarry!"
2,This is Scary?,"My friend bought Blair Witch the first day it came out. I went over and saw it. Yeas there were some frightening moments, but I was outright disappointed. The hype really did take away from it all and I guess seeing it in the movie theaters was be more frightening than a 13 inch television."
1,This movie bites!,"I cannot believe all these 4 and 5-star ratings I'm seeing! I have had to endure watching that movie 3 times! The first time I was so anxious to see it that I saw it alone. At the end of the movie , I looked over at the guy next to me and we just gave each other a look like ""that was it!"" I just could not believe the ending, or any other part of it. Then, my mom wanted to see it and luckily she paid for me. She didn't believe me when I said it wasn't scary. She gets scared easily, and was disappointed also. Then, my friend wanted to see it and of course she wouldn't listen either, but she found out also. So at least I know I'm not the only one that hated it. Oh well, I guess we just don't have enough ""imagination"". And all the silence in the movie theater wasn't from people being scared, it was from them probably being asleep!"
3,"IT WAS GREAT BUT AT THE END WAS ODD,WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?","I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT EXCEPT I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE SHOWN HOW THE TEENAGERS GOT KILLED. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS WITH THE ENDING WHEN IT SAID ""THIS FOOTAGE HAS RECENTLY BEEN FOUND"". IT WASN'T THE REAL KIDS WHO GOT LOST IT WAS STILL THE ACTORS.ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS THE STORY LINE TRUE OR NOT?!"
2,do not reccomend,This movie was a disappointment. I have a vivid imagination and scare fairly easily. I spent this movie rolling my eyes. It moves slow and the diaglouge and banter between characters is tiring.
4,Campfire Tale,"I really enjoyed the Blair Witch Project. It reminded me of an old hometown horror tale always told by the campfire. Everyone has some sort of fear whether it be monsters in the closet, or being lost in the woods. Watching this movie from the perspective of a hand-held camera made it more interesting than the typical movie perspective. It is definately not for everyone, but if you have a respect for creativity than you'll enjoy this movie."
3,Its hard to believe its not real,After watching this with my 13 year old I had to convince him it wasn't real.It was good though to have the creeps and chills without all the blood and guts.Makes you wonder what ever happened to Josh though.Wouldn't recommend it to others
1,This movie blows!,"The best suspense of this film is seen during the commercials on television. What a waste of an hour and a half. You only live once, so don't waste your time on this flick."
2,It wasn't all that good.,It wasn't what everyone tried to make it out to be. They said it would keep me on the edge of my seat. But it didn't even do that. I almost fell asleep a couple times.
2,Completely overrated,"I can't believe that people were raving about this movie. OK, the innovative camera use, and switching between video and 16mm was good. But the plot got boring in many places. The ending was not tied up in any way. So what happened to Josh? And why was Michael standing in the corner? And WAS there a witch or was it just some ""crazies"" living in the house? If the movie was more exciting and/or really scary/suspenseful, I wouldn't have cared - I would've been caught up in the film - but I wasn't. Very overrated film. The directors have a good eye, but need better work on a script."
1,the footage should have stayed lost - or been cut a bit more,"There were three scary parts to the film, two I can't review as it would spoil the film and the third is the violent camera work. I accept that this is supposed to be their documentary footage but its hardly award winning stuff.The film did not maintain the interest of the audience, infact, I've never seen so many people walk out of a film. The times that they build the tension they lost it to long stretches of nothing but Heather and Mike arguing.A very clever idea but not tight enough to scare the majority of people. I do however, identify well with the feeling of being lost while tramping/hiking."
1,Worst movie of the decade!,"This is no ""Exorcist"". I got the video hoping for some kind of thrill. You could go to the bathroom 5 times and not miss anything. Anyone who has a video camera and knows 2 other people could make this film. They don't even have to be in the movie. I fast-forwarded through the whole movie and didn't even see anything worth talking about. And that's just what the movie was, all talk, no action. Very, very disappointing. Anyone who likes this movie has got to be brain-dead."
2,A medicore thriller at best,"I can't understand how this film can ever relate to the horror genre. It's overhyped because there is nothing in there to scare a child. I myself get scared very easily and was anticipating a lot from this little film, but when I watched it, I became very disappointed. I apperciate the effort they've put in this film, it was not boring, but it's not worth buying."
4,Not a total disappointment,"The Blair Witch Project is an good film and I liked it a lot. It is very spooky and the atmosphere surreal. I have been a diehard horror film since I was a kid and I thought what made the movie successful is the viewer has to forget the old formula horror films and put themselves in place of the actors. Sometimes it is what you don't know is what makes a movie scary and if you were in that situation, it would be frightening. As far as the shaking of the camera and bad lighting goes, it adds a touch of realism you would expect if you made such a film yourself. In summary, I have always liked off-beat horror films, I have seen some very good ones and some very bad ones, and I would place the BWP towards the good ones."
5,BRILLIANT,"LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE BEFORE ME ,WHO'VE SEEN THIS FILM, AND UNDERSTOOD IT.WE THOUGHT IT WAS BRILL .TO JUDGE THIS MOVIE, I REALLY DO INSIST YOU SEE IT FIRST.ONLY YOU CAN BE THE JUDGE & JURY."
3,"Great premise, poor execution","Like many people, I too first viewed BWP during the recent ""Season of the Witch"", and like many others, was left somewhat disappointed. I was a very willing participant and was looking forward to some chills and terror, but unfortunately the film failed to deliver. I believe the filmmakers let the viewers off the hook too easily - there is tension and terror in the night, yet these scenes seemed too short. It is essentially a long build-up (relatively speaking) with an all too brief pay-off."
4,scary but original,"I thought this a great movie but you expect what's going to happen at the end.Don't get me wrong, I loved the ending and how it was so real. I saw it early in the summer and I still think about it when i go into the woods. I think that it is one of the best scary movies I have seen ever.Don't listen to the bad reviews. They don't know what they're saying so GO SEE IT!!!"
5,scary scary scary,"anyone who says this movie was not scary,can join the bill clinton LIE club. enough said."
1,JUST DOWN RIGHT HORRIBLE,"This has to be the worst piece of junk that I have ever seen. This movie is so bad. It is in no way scary, there is no blood, and the acting is horrible. As if; like I would actually buy this video. I saw it at the movie theatres on opening night because I was suckered by all the hype. The only reason that it is rated R is because of the profanity. I can't believe that there are people out there who are crazy enough to buy this lame crap. Don't waste your money. Believe me, it is not worth it."
1,Ed Wood Couldn't Make A Movie This Bad!,"This is without a doubt a film which should stand by itself as a true piece of garbage, not even deserving the title of ""motion picture"". It is a sad statement of our society that a THING this bad could have enough people like it, so as to enable the producers to make millions! It isn't even good enough for a laugh. Unbelievable GARBAGE! I'm using the DVD as a coaster."
2,"Badly Over Rated, Not scary","Okay, kids are trapped in the woods with something (that you never see) following them. OOOOOOHHHH! Despite the poor acting and alot of swearing- it seems to be kind of a think movie. A movie that if you think about it, it might seem scary. Waste of money."
2,"Unscripted, and it shows","Men on film: And now for The Blair Witch Project, Hated it! OK, in all seriousness, I did hate it. First, as my title says, it was horribly unscripted. They cursed and whined and swore and fought and profaned and complained and used colorful French, and in the end, particularly because of their French use(that's a joke), I really didn't care what happened to them. They weren't endearing characters, there was only the scantiest of a plot, which made me hate them all the more, and the ending was just...there. If you like cheap scares, see The Mummy. If you want less cheap scares, see Swirl of Echoes(I think that's the title). If you're habitually empathetic with all movie characters, regardless of jerkiness(pun intended), see The Blair Witch Project."
1,"Boring, No Plot","this should have come on network tv. What a waste of $4.00! There was no plot, how do we even know the Blair Witch existed? We don't! I believe that these kids just wanted to make some loot and did. I have a story idea. How about the Blair Witch of the Ghetto! Now that's scary!"
2,"Could have been a good horror film, if.....","Like most of the people out there, I was curious to see what all the talk was about on this movie. Family members had seen it and said it scared the daylights out of them. And these were people who don't scare easy. The only problem was that before I saw the movie, I saw one of the actors on Jay Leno. So when the ending came, I knew it wasn't true. And the ending made the whole movie. The actors/actress should have stayed hidden to make the movie more believable, then it would have scared the daylights out of me. Now you have to wonder, was any of the movie true?"
3,Scary but not enough,"Although this movie had crappy camera action i had to agree that it was a nice horror movie it had the right ideas but this low budget movie was not enough to ""scare the hell into me"""
4,I will not be hiking through the woods anytime soon.,"I loved the effect of the"" home video"". After you see this video, you will not go camping, or hiking in the woods for a long time. The uneasy feeling that you get will stay with you for a long, long time."
2,"good concept, but....","wasn't this movie supposed scary? i was a little scared after the movie, but that quickly wore off. i was lead by all my friends and reviews to believe it was the scariest movie ever. there is no story behind the legend (except for scattered facts thrown into the movie) but it left me wanting to know more. if you want a real horror mockumentary, go see the last broadcast. another low budget, but much better carried out movie."
