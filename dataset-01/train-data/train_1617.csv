3,Goes a little too fast,"I am probably just giving up to early. Just got it and just tried it. But I felt like an idiot because she doesn't take any time to show the steps. So it's probably best to know these steps beforehand or give it several goes. It looked a bit more doable when I just watched it. But then again, I don't pick up steps very easily. Perhaps I'll just stick to Leslie and her walking DVD's. That's more for me and my two left feet. Perhaps I'll try this DVD when I feel more ready to give it a try."
2,Not the best cardio video,I was disappointed. Not the best or most fun exercise video. The moves are rather boring. The music isn't the best either.
3,Just didn't do anything for me,"I looked at this DVD once and put it in the back of the cabinet. The exercise moves may be useful enough, but I found the drummer, the instructor and the other participants entirely too distracting to allow me to get into it. Her voice is annoying and hyper. I like salsa music, but maybe it's only in a salsa dancing venue that I like it. I just couldn't find anything appealing about this. I give three stars because I'm pretty sure it'll get your heart rate up, and ultimately that is the point."
4,Fun!,"I really like this because it's varied and fast paced. It is a bit difficult to stay perfectly in step the first time or two, but well worth the effort to learn. Also since it's salsa dancing, it's low impact, so if you have delicate knees it's a great alternative to more bouncy aerobics workouts."
3,fast,"Very fast paced. If you really dont know how to do any latin dances, then I wouldn't recommend getting this. If you do, then this would be fun."
2,Not what I expected !!,"I am a fan of salsa music and i thought that this dvd would be fun to try and put in a part of my work outs. The instructor was just wayyyy too much. too loud , too hyper. she came off very corny at times. lol. the video is just dumb. i dont know ,i just found her annoying.The music was good and all but i just cant take her. I dont do this video often. Once in a blue. It really wasnt as good as thought it was gonna be. i have other crunch video but come on now. they need better instructors."
2,Frustrating,"This was too fast-paced for me. I had a very hard time trying to follow the steps. Also, I didn't feel like I was doing ""salsa"" at all. The instructor says at the end that ""now you can use these steps on the dance floor!"" However, you'd probably just get laughed at if you tried, because they don't look like dance steps at all.If you really want to try salsa dancing as a workout, sign up for a salsa dancing class and skip this DVD."
2,Only for skilled dancers,I am an intermediate amateur salsa dancer and she still lost me within the first few minutes when she assumed that I could just segue into grapevines in opposing directions and box steps with no breakdown or slowing down of the moves to get the hang of it. I turned it off in frustration. This workout is really only right for someone with dance training who can follow an un-taught dance routine without skipping a beat.
4,Fun,"I like this video because the short segments keep your mind off the clock. Giselle is a bit peppy and cheesy, but not to the point of making you not want to do the video. It's not an intense workout, and you do have to do it a couple of times before you get the steps right, but it is a good video to add to the collection for some variety."
3,"More Salsa, please",This was decent but I was definitely looking for a little more Salsa and a little less Cardio.
2,Not fun!,I did not like it. I was expecting a bit more of salsa steps instead it looks more like gymnastic. Not good if you know what latin dance means!
4,Rosie from Loudon Tn.,"The salsa music really gets you motivated. You have to have some coordination, but its alot of fun. Being latin I had no trouble. It might be a little fast for some, but the instructor gets you through it and you will burn calories."
3,Average workout,"Fun for the Salsa style, but in my opinion, the easiest out of all of the Crunch Dance videos. Still I worked up a sweat doing it."
3,difficult steps but not an intense cardio workout,"This DVD is great with steps but not with explanantions, the instructor screams instructions at you quickly with explanations that don't help unless you are familiar with all the dance steps in the first place. Before purchasing this video i would purchase something that will let you become more familar with the steps like Minna's Emergency Workout or Kathy Smiths Latin Grooves. This dvd is for all levels but for intermediates and advanceds this is not going to get your heart pumping enough where it is really challenging. The most challenging part of the workout itself are the dance steps so beware!!!"
4,Crunch Videos Work,"I have several Crunch videos, and wanted to try Zumba but didn't want to spend much just to try it out. This video was reasonable and turned out to be a decent workout with ""mirrored"" movements and clear explanations of how to move. It is not exactly Zumba, but Zumba-esque."
2,Potential for fun...if your feet can keep up,"This workout has potential to be a nice break from the monotony of standard cardio aerobic workouts---if you are keen on programs requring speedy feet and minimal movement/step breakdown. Don't expect this to mimic the salsa dancing you might do with another person at a club but if you take the time to breakdown Giselle's lightening fast moves I am sure they transfer to actual dance.This DVD is split into sections: Salsa, Merengue, Samba and Salsa-Merengue combinations. If done back to back this completes an appoximately 35 minute workout. With time I began to enjoy this program but like many reviewers found the learning curve very steep.I no longer use this program much but for those into the Salsa/Latin dance genre it does have potential."
3,More aerobics than dance,"This routine was okay, but it is more like aerobics than true dance (e.g. has knee lifts and lunges). I could follow the cueing okay except for changing feet. I always ended up on the wrong foot and confused. I like Dance off the Inches: Dance It off Ballroom a lot better because the focus there is on learning dance moves there and I feel beautiful and stylish. This one felt like exercising rather than dancing. This workout is too intense for a beginner like me to get through it and I don't feel motivated to keep at it to build up my endurance."
4,Great workout,"I've owned this as a video and looked for it as a DVD when we finally chucked the VCR. Although I don't feel like I'm at a club, there are lots of latin moves, the music is fast and upbeat, the pace is quick, and the routines are fun. I definately worked up a sweat. I am not a dancer and picked up the moves just fine. It really helped my endurance level go up, and I looked forward to exercise again."
4,Lighthearted fun,"I enjoyed this movie when it first ran on one of those cable TV networks, and I still enjoy it today. I love how far-fetched -- and campy -- the plot is, and Bob Newhart is fantastic in his role. It's the perfect movie if you just want to unwind and have fun. I was left with the impression that the entire cast really enjoyed being a part of the film. It's the kind of script I loved getting when I was involved in theater in high school and college. Personally, I liked ""The Librarian"" better than ""National Treasure,"" although NT wasn't too bad. I would have given ""The Librarian"" five stars, but it's not Indiana Jones."
1,DID NOT GET,I sent money through Pay Pal THEN was told it was out of stock! A bunch of crap! It shouldn't have been advertised.
1,The Librarian: Quest for the Spear,"The movie is great and works great (and thank God, it is in English), but the cover is in Korean...Go Figure That!"
4,Something for the family,"I'm not a prude by any means, but in a world where SEX and SEX JOKES seems to be the ONLY creative thing to be seen on TV anymore, it is refreshing to see movies like NATIONAL TREASURE and this made for TV special.... LIBRARIAN-Spear of Destiny.They are both a bit ""cheesey"" but are a much needed and refreshing wholesome break from the constant stagnation being seen in Hollywood and on TV today.This is a ""made for the family"" type of movie .... sort of like a modernized Indiana Jones or Doc Savage for TV"
5,Great Family Movie,"This movie reminds me a lot of National Treasure. It is a great movie for the whole family. Noah Wylie did an excellent job. Great plot, very interesting, quite enjoyable. Would love to see a sequel!"
3,Entertaining,Entertaining but without real substance. I like this movie better as more of a 3.5 stars in that it's not as good as the Indian Jones movies it tries to emulate but much better than most of the made for TV dross that comes out. Noah Wyle as the nebbish scholar who has spent his entire life learning and getting degrees sells this movie. Without him you could not make another 'Librarian' movie...Bob Newhart and Jane Curtain are excellent supporting cast members. If you want a fun movie that believes itself and doesn't try to oversell the 'hidden clues that only one man can decipher' angle then look no farther.
4,for a tv movie not bad,"If you enjoy movies like Indiana Jones or National treasure this movie is for you, I'm not saying its as great as them but a good supplment. My husband enjoys them so I bought him the set."
5,Great Made for TV Movie!,"What a great movie! As a sci-fi/adventure movie junkie this was right up my alley! It's more of a comedic/scholastic version of Indiana Jones. I hope there will be future ""Librarian"" movies to come!"
5,A Good Movie,"I really enjoy this made for T.V. movie. It has a little bit of everything. There's action, fantasy, adventure, and a nice healthy dose of comedy. Bob Newhart is a lot of fun. I only wish that they would have turned this into a T.V. series."
4,totally awesome,"this is a fun action adventure movie for those of us who enjoy geeky heroes. if you are a fan of the daniel jackson character from stargate, you will love noah wyle's character."
4,not bad for a direct to video,The premise was kind of corny but the acting talents made up for the lack of overall depth of script. The special effects were actually pretty good.
1,$75 ... really?,Plain and simple - the movie itself is great but why is it so expensive. Somehow I do not see this being a super collectable item that will be worth thousands of dollars in the future. Guess I'll just have to by the other two (for less than $15 total) and be happy with them ... :-/
4,good flick,"I enjoyed the whole movie! It is an adventure with some comic relief. I like the characters, the plot and it's Indiana Jones/Mummy type theme. It was enjoyable and very goos for a tv movie. I would definitely recommend it."
4,The Librarian - Quest for the Spear,"What a funny movie - it takes every cliche from the Indiana Jones movies, plus a few others and packs them into one fast paced movie. Don't watch this expecting to see what real librarians do - I've been one for over 20 years and have yet to have someone try and kill me. Still, it's a lot of fun, lighthearted, and watching for the various ""old"" movie references can keep you on your toes. Can you say ""Lost Horizon""?"
4,Fun to Watch,"I just love watching this show. I had no problem with the picture everything is in English except for what is on the cover, but that doesn't matter. This is just a fun show to watch."
4,Amusing,"Noah Wyle exceeded expectations and Bob Newhart & Jane Curtain were fun to see in action. The premise of the film was interesting, and the special effects were just fine."
4,Unsophisticated But Very Entertaining.,"The plot, actors and production are unsophisticated, and even predictable. But there is a continuous mix of comedy and action that keeps viewer interest and makes the movie entertaining. It is also more family friendly than most contemporary movies."
3,Somewhat helpful,This book was ok... I was hoping for more current styles and a little more step by step with pictures... but it's ok.
3,It is what it is.,"This movie is largely forgotten for good reason. It really is a slapdash effort by everyone involved. But if you're even looking here, it's probably out of a sense of nostalgia. Perhaps you remember seeing ""Assault on a Queen"" on late night TV in the 1970s, as I did. They must have run it a hundred times back then. Maybe you're curious as to whether or not it holds up to your childhood memories as a tense and entertaining crime caper adventure. Rest assured, it does NOT.On this blu-ray you get the movie (and absolutely NOTHING else) presented as well as you'll ever see it with surprisingly fine picture quality and decent mono sound. This is not a good movie - never has been. But if you still want it this blu-ray delivers the ""goods""."
4,Not bad,Good movie for the era that it was made. Nice seeing Frank Sinatra. Good acting. The effects and sets are cheesy at some points. Enjoyed it.
4,Sinatra raises a German U-Boat to hijack the Queen Mary,"Frank Sinatra plays Mark Brittain, a former submarine officer, who joins rich Italian beauty Rosa Lucchesi (Virna Lisi) and her partners Vic Rossiter (Tony Franciosa) and Eric Lauffnauer (Alf Kjellin) in diving for lost treasure off the coast of Florida. When they discover a sunken German submarine, Luaffnauer the former U-Boat commander convinces the others to raise the sub and use it to hijack the Queen Mary. ""Assault on a Queen"" drags a little bit when they are restoring the sub, but the actual attempt at hijacking redeems the film. You know things are not going to work according to plan but you have to believe Sinatra's character is going to come out of this ahead. Still, you can never be sure. This 1966 film was directed by Jack Donohue and had a script by Rod Serling from the novel by Jack Finney. Final Note: The music for ""Assault on a Queen"" was by Duke Ellington."
5,A great moive classic - Sinatra carries the film and based on a great novel by Jack Finney,"I remember seeing this film decades ago growing up & thinking ""What a great story!!"" This is one film, albiet more due to it's age and lack of production knowledge back then, that I'd very much like to see a re-make of! A timeless classic that will live on!"
2,Shallow woman strangely loved by nice man,A shallow flirtatious heroine oddly fascinates a rumpled but very nice man. She proceeds to do stupid things & he tries to protect her. Not a fun read.
3,Nixon,"I think the video did a good job of explaining the presidency of Richard Nixon. However, I think the video should have focused more on Nixon's good qualities. The video could have dealt more on his early family history. The video could have mentioned something about his stance on Civil Rights early in his career. No one doubts that Nixon did wrong during the Watergate episode. In spite of this, Richard Nixon had a profound influence on American foreign policy. One question I ask is ""What would have happened if Nixon had won in 1960?"" We probably would not have had the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam debacle. I also think Nixon would have advanced Civil Rights in a more forward manner than Kennedy. The question will never be answered, but it is fun to think about."
4,Nixon,"The DVD ""Nixon, A Presidency Revealed was outstanding. The History Channel DVD's are usually high quality and this one is NO exception to this rule."
3,Good but,"Has many popular licks with tab and such. The backing tracks are good. The CD ONLY has the backing tracks on it, ie does not have the individual licks and examples."
2,Difficult to use,"This could be a very good book. But there are two main ""defects"": the size of the book is to small and the print too difficult to read if you are holding a guitar (well, you can read it if you squint). The second defect is inadequate audio tracks."
3,Not what I expected,"I guess I didn't really think about the size as stated 6 x 9. But that is too small. Why? Why not make it full size like other music books? Book won't stay open. Now for the audio CD included. Wow, really lowrate. I mean, whose idea was it to have saxophone play all the melodies? You can't sing it? OR you just don't want pay license fee for use of the lyrics? The cheese factor of this play along CD is pretty high.Also, if we are supposed to be able to ""jam"" along with the track, you need to back off on the existing guitar tracks so we have some space to shred."
2,Esther Movie,"The movie cut out much of the Biblical story, and was somewhat disjointed. At that time the Medo-Persian Empire extended all the way to Africa, and all of the Middle East, for which it had little or no references or scenes. I would recommend that one of the other productions of Esther be pursued, leaving this one out.Ben"
1,Very misleading.,"It shows ESTHER after being kidnapped and groomed give herself freely and submissivly to the king as a prostitute would. They immediately go from a short greeting to a passion love scene in the bed. There is no mention of this in scripture. There is no reason to assume that this great JEWISH HEROINE gave up her dignity and pride. All scripture tells us is that she was brought to the chamber and then chosen as the QUEEN. It is reckless and sexist to assume that she was not as virtuos and dignified as the prophets DANIEL, ELIAS, JEREMIAH, SAMUEL, EZECHIEL,ISAIAH ETC..... I find it impossible to believe the GREAT woman so easily tossed her virtue aside. I think she was made queen and did it all with great dignity."
4,Almost A Five Star1,"This movie was actually well done. As most people know, when you read a story first, then see a movie of that story, the movie rarely lives up to one's expectations. It truly is a blessing to see. Most of the acting is well done. The costume and settings are excellent. It is very close to biblical accuracy. I do recommend this movie to anyone, even if they are unfamiliar with the bible. Anyone who enjoys a good movie would like this."
4,Good but production low-budget?,"Enjoyed this biblical account of Queen Esther and her influence over and protection of the nation of Israel.I felt the production could have been a bit more interesting and graphical. I felt it was lacking in visual scenes and it seemed more could have been spent to ""beef it up a bit"" if you compare it with something like the Movie ""King David"" with Richard Gere or the movie ""Joseph"" which was extremely well done!However, this is still a good portrayal of the lovely biblical Queen Esther and her goodness and ""drive"" to save the Jewish nation! You will get the message!"
5,trusting in God,This movie i must say comes straight out of the Bible. What i find fascinating in this story is the truth of how this women Esther had to leave her family to be chosen to marry a king whom she may only be with once in her entire life time. It has a bit of romance not to mention how handsome the king is. I incourage you to read the story of Esther to be able to get the whole concept of this movie because a miracle does take place with the Jews. It makes you realize just how powerful prayer is.
2,Biblical But Unimpressive,"The book of Esther lacks nothing for a great film. I hoped this would be it, but I was disappointed.It's probably one of the more biblical versions, but the quality of the production and some of the license taken with the story is annoying. The false noses on some of the Jewish characters is laughable, and most of the acting is terrible. The most annoying part is the way the film makes King Ahasuerus out as some weak, whiney young man who over-reacts to everything like a toddler, and can't think for himself.I work in youth ministry, and I was hoping to show clips of this as we study Esther. I don't think I can show scenes of this to a room full of teenagers, though, and expect them to take it seriously."
5,Love this movie,I really enjoy this movie and I have read the book of Esther numerous times. This is a movie I would recommend to friends and family.
5,Very good adaptation,Just completed a Bible Study on the Book of Esther - this was an excellent adaptation. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend.
5,Beautful Love Story,Makes you want to go back in time and relive this great era of a women who saved Isreal from extinction.
3,Don't be fooled - it's on permenant backorder,"This is, what, the 5th or 6th pushback for this? Somebody at thier label must hate them. Or thier incompetant. Labels take note: when mass bootlegging technology is available to everyone, pushing back albums repeatedly will only make a problem worse. If the music industry wants to repair sales, they should stop treating thier customers like it's 1993 when it comes to release dates."
3,Alright for the price,Not as heavy duty as I hoped. The camo design is a plastic material instead of cloth like i hoped. The strap is much to small for me when fully extended.
3,Great Sounds!,"This CD player has great sound to it. Its color is really appealing as well. This disadvatages to this CD player I found were that it uses up batteries fast and it does not have a hold button. It is really great if you like to have good Bass sound, because it has a DBBS Bass system that works really great. The anti-skip works well, I have not had it skip yet. A great sounding CD player overall!"
3,Does have some remastered Done With Mirrors tracks.,"This compilation does have some good qualities.The ""Done With Mirrors"" tracks are sounding good in remastered form.I always disliked the original production of that CD.Combined with Young Lust/ Gold anthology; reaps all but 2 remastered DWM tracks.Also, has the I'm Down song from Permanent Vacation, missing on other comps.Other good tracks, though not too many 'monster hits', but most will already have those anyway.So it works if you already have the Young Lust/ Gold anthology and don't need the original full length releases."
4,"Funny, rockin' punk-fusion","Dunno how you could not like this album. Mostly instrumental bass and drums rocking out with spacey harmonics or fretless distorted melodies. Some songs have spoken-word vocals as well, most of which are pretty darn funny.(...)"
1,Not at all what I expected; HORRIBLE,"This couldn't even be a good record for those who like jazz. With 2 bass players and no guitarists I expected an album full of great bass solos and riffs. Thats not it, there isnt any singing, just some talking sometimes which is really annoying. There are sometimes cool drumbeats but that is about it. I just expected a lot more with Mike Manring (bassist) in it. I do not recommend this to anyone."
3,Great Late-Nite Pizza flick!,"This movie has it all! Spooky ghouls, Occult practices, blood splatter, and Phyllis Diller as the diabolical Poopinplatz! This is a great flick to kick back and watch with friends and just have fun. I loved the cheese factor and the surprisingly interesting concept. I think everyone should see this at least once; heck.. I even bought it so I could show my friends the wierdest ""horror"" movie ever made! I have to admit.. there are several points that actually made me jump in surprise!"
3,This will definately keep any b-movie fan pleased,"This movie has almost everything to keep a cheesy movie fan pleased. It has zombies, phyllis diller, a psychic, and a big zombie poodle. Yes, a zombie poodle. The zombie poodle didn't get as much screen time as it should've but its worth the price for that alone. The original box had a picture of the poodle on it with the quote ""keep repeating to yourself, it's only a poodle"" and thats why I originally watched this. The only reason it didn't get a higher review was because the movie drags until the last half."
3,Pure Cheese....,"Ok, yes, it is bad. BAD. But it's soooo cheesy that it's funny. if you sre looking for something to scare you, this will only work if you're a film major. Then you will be scared that this movie was made. But, it's a comedy (in my eyes). Just remember that when the killer poodle appears!"
2,THE BONE YARD starring Phyllis Diller,"The only reason I want this movie is because it was filmed here in our little town and my son was one of the ""extras"" in it. It has been very difficult to find. As for the movie - it's funny in spots and grotesque in spots. It's certainly not the worst movie I have ever seen nor was it the best. It's not something that I would ordinarily buy."
2,No Bones About It: This Movie Kind Of Sucks,"I really had high expectations for The Boneyard because I watched the trailer online, and it made it appear as if it were a hilarious horror-comedy. Looks can be deceiving. The Boneyard is only remotely funny when Phyllis Diller is onscreen, which is about ten minutes. The rest of the time, The Boneyard is just too serious to be fun. And the zombies don't even look good. Disappointing."
2,"It's kinda boring, but kinda funny too!","I give it 2 stars because it is really boring. It doesn't get going until way into the movie, then it isn't even that much fun. Phillys Diller, her dog, and the scary little creep kids are the stars here, and they get about 10 minuntes total of the film. The other characters aren't interesting or funny in the least bit, and aren't even tolerable, honestly. They're on the screen waaay too long. It took me two sittings to get through this one. When it's funny, it's weak, but if you love B-films, although I do, you might want to try it out. It seems to be more sought after now that it's no longer made."
1,"Oh God, it was terrible!!!","This was terrible! Horrible!!!! With Phylis Diller as a killer, with the name Poopinplatz! I mean, there was no thrill to this! The cover looked semi-interesting, but then I saw this and nearly cried, it was so terrible! And one character was this woman who was brought in as a supposed DOA. And then she was alive! I mean, how is this a credible movie?!! When I say horrible, I mean horrible. I swear to you all now, don't dare pick this up if you see it at the movie store. You will be in for a pile of trash."
4,A prototype goth album,"I haven't heard any of the group's other albums, but I recently got around to ""Bloodletting"" after finding it for cheap. I had heard the title track which was pretty memorable and one my parents had listened to when I was pretty young, as well as ""Joey"" and ""Tomorrow, Wendy."" The latter is so stand-out-ish. It's disturbing yet beautiful and I don't know what draws me into the track. It has such a cynical view on the world, yet somehow it really appeals to me.However, I will give one warning: If you don't like dark music that is also humorless, you're not going to enjoy ""Bloodletting."" Aside from the fact that it arguably takes it self a bit too seriously, and some tracks come off as rather average on here, but there are plenty of great cuts -- particularly ""The Sky Is a Poisonous Garden"" and ""Darkening of the Light."" It is well written and performed, though."
5,The Finest Moment from the Most Underrated Band in Music,"Bloodletting is simply an awesome album - I play it all the time. Why are they not more popular???? NO ONE has a better voice than Johnette Napolitano and their songs simply kick a@!!#?. You've heard of ""Joey"", but it's much more than that. Haunting & morose, yet uplifting and moving at the same time - all because of Johnette's intense, emotional delivery. Do yourself a favor and buy this album."
5,A MUST HAVE!!,"Everyone's got different music preferences, but, if you like ""rock"" or anything along those lines, I've got to say that you would really enjoy this CD. I believe a track was left out of the listing, which can't be overlooked: ""Bloodletting (the Vampire song)"". Take a listen & see what the hypes about."
3,It's good.. not great,"This is a solid album, but I don't think it's for everyone. As others have said, it's quite dark. In fact, it's relentless in its darkness. Now, I think there's value in addressing the darker side of life at times, but I found that frustrating after a while - there was just no hope at all in any of the songs, at least to me. I'm not a huge fan of Johnette Napolitano's voice, which didn't help. The muscianship was good, overall, and as dark as the lyrics were, they were still quite intelligent and meaningful. The songs I do like are Caroline, Darkening of the Light, The Beast, and Joey. The album isn't one I'm going to put in my ""discard"" pile, but it's also not something I can see myself playing on a regular basis, unlike say, Amanda Marshall, Jann Arden, or Collective Soul."
2,Bloated around the edges,"If only Johnette hadn't read those Anne Rice novels, we'd have a better album. Thanks to ""Joey,"" this was their biggest hit, but this is not their best. ""Walking in London"" and ""Mexican Moon"" are superior, but this does have the great ""Caroline."" The rhythm is solid throughout (courtesy of ex-Roxy Music drummer Paul Thompson on the sticks), but it never gelled for me, and ""Tomorrow, Wendy"" is endless. Endlessly boring, that is."
3,the sky is a poisonous garden,"Concrete Blonde to me, were never an essential part of my listening. but i love the songs ""Joey"" and ""Tomorrow, wendy"" quite a bit. the vocals have a great smokey whiskey-soaked edge to them and the band is certainly musically competent. i rarely listen to this album as a whole...but overall, it's well done glam goth rock."
3,fun postcard from the close of the 80's,"I think Bloodletting is the definitive work to come out of a weird little Los Angeles scene in which affluent yuppies positioned themselves as down-and-out, Bukowski-esque, noble losers. This is music that glorifies pain, particularly that of addiction, not for its own sake, but as if to apologize for being well-off and pretty -- for being everything you'd expect a California rock band to be. Concrete Blonde should've been contracted to write music for Dynasty or Falcon Crest, or any other prime time soap opera about intrigue among the fabulously wealthy. And there's nothing wrong with that. I like this music, but it hasn't aged very well; rock singers adopting ""characters"" doesn't play so well in the wake of the tortured honesty of grunge (for better or, more likely, for worse, those kids from Seattle altered what it means to be a pop artist). Regardless, ""Joey"" chokes me up every time."
3,Not what I thought it would be.,"I thought it would be rhymes that help in memorization, but it is just the tables being sung to mediocre tunes."
2,Good movie but terrible DVD,The quality of DVD-Rs from Sinister Cinema is always variable. This is one of the worst. On a regular TV the image is letterboxed at about 1.75 with the picture looking squashed together. On a flat screen you can adjust the image to the correct 2.35 aspect ratio. This is the only positive aspect of this DVD other than the movie itself. The source print it is taken from has no color at all and it is scratched with splices throughout. If I didn't like the movie so much I would have only given it one star. This film deserves a better presentation but right now I suppose this is as good as it gets.
2,"Good Movie, Lousy DVD",I agree with Gary from Los Angeles. I have always enjoyed biblical movies and now collect them. I saw this one in the theater when it first came out. I distinctly remember the color being bright and vivid. This movie was hard to get so I was thrilled finally to obtain a VHS version. But I was disappointed with the picture quality. So when the DVD came out I was really hoping that it had been restored/remastered. Nope. It looks like they made the DVD from the lousy VHS - and this time I was REALLY disappointed. How unprofessional! But like Gary I kept it because I like the movie. I'm still hoping a better version will come out. I've seen much worse movies restored so why not this one? Or at least find a better version to make the DVD!!
2,bad impulse buy,"Because of the low price, this was an impulse buy for Christmas for my 2 boys, 2 and 3.5. Unfortunately, they don't like this at all.Stick with the more expensive movies by Pixar, like all 3 Toy Story moviesToy Story 2Even though those are more expensive, they're cheaper in terms of value based on how many hours kids will spend watching them.$4 for a dvd kids won't watch is a waste of money compared to $18 for a dvd kids will watch for literally 100+ hours over a period of years. That $18 is well spent."
4,His music has a Latin feeling but he still rocks....,"ATU - Transcultural (PlanZ Media)ATU is an artist that composes ""electronic ethnic"" music with many references at Latin scene and also progressive rock, punk, etc. There are songs both in Spanish and English but they are in the same music philosophy, electronic but not dance - just experimental tunes and a Latin figure."
3,Confusing,"This book confused me. An unhappyman and his wife live with theiryoung son. The wife wants anotherchild. The man refuses to allowthe wife to have another child,but he has a child with hisresearch co-worker. The baby isgiven a happiness gene. The babynever cries, not even when heis severely cut or stung by a wasp.But what is this story about? Whatwas the author trying to say?And what did the ending mean?I have no idea."
2,Yet Another Live Numan Album. Nothing To See Here! Move Along!,"Yeah, another Numan live album. The only reason I'd want this is that it features a few tracks from my treasured Numa Records period of his career from 84-87. One of my fave tracks from this period, ""Call Out The Dogs"" turns up here and is most welcome but you still have to wade through material that is on EVERY OTHER NUMAN LIVE ALBUM. You know the tracks. And let's face it, Numan is hardly the most compelling of live performers! And yet he has almost as many live albums as studio outings. Methinks he likes to milk the faithful a bit too much! This outing gets 2 stars because half of it dates from a more contemporary period that I quite liked in Numan's millieu. Otherwise, for collectors only."
3,"This isn't music, this is survival","This is possibly the least of all Gary Numan's live offerings. The four live versions of tracks from the 'Metal Rhythm' studio album (released just before this) don't sound particularly strong, oddly enough. Numan fluffs his lines occasionally and seems strangely unmoved by the experience. However, all is not lost. There are good versions of the old standards and a brilliant version of 'Call out the Dogs'. However, a little more imagination and a wider cross-section from the selected songs would have been nice. For the complete live Gary Numan experience, grab hold of 'Dream Corrosion'."
3,Just Jaeckin?,"Is that the director's name or occupation? Could be both in this film, as far as I can tell. I've been looking for this film for years under the name it used when I first saw it on late-night cable decades ago, ""The French Woman"". It was, shall we say, integral in propelling me into puberty and has a certain sentimental value to me. You can imagine my annoyance when I found that it has been available for quite some time under what I assume is it's proper name.It's better than your run of the mill modern erotica in the sense that it tries to be clever in posing as a ""political thriller"" of sorts. The director is actually fairly good at skin flicks--more interesting than Jean Rollin or Jess Franco--and makes a film that almost doesn't seem like you're watching a gratuitous flesh-fest.The dvd quality is pretty bad and looks like a vhs was used, but that's not a new development in this type of genre and time-frame. But overall it's Just Jaeckin!!"
1,Like everyone says - WEAK PINS,"I have disconnected this cable TWO times only to temporarily relocate the TV and guess what - Yes, one of the pins got bent and broke off. Now this expensive cable is just a worthless piece of junk. Don't by this Monster Cable - try a different brand."
1,Poor construction,I bought this item for my home theater syatem. It performs well and give a lifelike definition on ordinary tv's. I won't recommend it though because the pins are feebly constructed and bend easily. Yesterday I removed the cables for cleaning and the pins broke...and I am very careful!DO NOT BUY!
5,Good cable,I don't know what everyone is talking about about weak pins. Maybe there not being carefull or got a defective unit but I have never had a problem. No idea how you would break s-video pins when your just pushing them straight in and pulling them straight out.
5,Highly recomended!,"I recently purchased this item here, and I was so very impressed. It drastically improved the quality of my dvd player. You know the difference in quality when you switch from watching regular tapes (vhs) to dvd? Well, it is the same ""step"" when you watch dvds with s-video, as watching dvds with s-video. My son said his Playstation 2 looked 10 times better with this s-video cord. It is definatetly worth the money! Highly recomended."
3,Colt Pachmayr Presentation grip,"I gave three out of five stars and a may be a little harsh here. The over all fit and finish is fine and the function is proper. My issue is that I bought these because I have always enjoyed the Presentation grip and you have an expectation of fit from the size of the handgun's frame dimension to the overall size of the grip. When I held my very first Model 29 with a Presentation grip I found it to be very pleasing in my hand hold. The Colt Official Police or the Python is not thicker in the frame than the Model 29 and yet the Colt version is about one and a half times as thick. It gives a very fat feel in the hand that is not unlike the Bill Jordan style of grips. If you order the Gripper series for the colt it feels just like the Model 29 Gripper so what gives? Like I said, it works but be aware it is a bit thick."
2,"Handling 1 star, DVD 2 stars, Content 3 stars, Custom service 4 stars.","I bought ""Special Collectors Wooden Box Set"", but received just 10 separate DVD's. Customer Service offers 3 options: replace, $24 refund, return for full refund. It's an international package and cost me about $35 tax and more than one week, so I prefer to keep the DVD's. Some of the discs were scratched and one was very badly. Although it can be read by my player, it has no relationship with ""Special Collectors"" anymore.The DVD's are not made with good quality. Lot of typos. The actual run time are much less than ""498 minutes"". The disks of Te Waza, Koshi Waza, Shime Waza, Kansetsu Waza are about 35 mins each.The content is very comprehensive for beginners but not very useful for advanced practicer. However it still has some valuable techniques and tricks. The Ne Waza part is quite good for modern judo practicer."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT....Don't buy,"This product is the WORST. I bought these thinking that they would protect my house from ruptured lines when I'm on vacation. I installed these flimsy hoses, turned the water back on and then turned the washer on...nothing. I went through the instructions to reset the hose. Took FIVE times before the darn thing would reset. Then the fun began. I turned the washer on and the water just barely comes out because of the flow restriction in the hose. It took twice as long to do a simple load of wash. I hate this product and now they won't let me return it. These are terrible. Save your money and go to your local hardware store and get a real braided metal hose. It will save you the headache and money. Now when I leave the house, I just turn the water off at the wall. I'd give it zero stars if they would let me."
1,DO NOT buy a Watts Hose!!!!!,"Within a few months my Stainless Steel Watts washing machine hose, which was supposed to prevent water damage, starting putting out a fine spray of water during the fill cycle. It soaked into the drywall and down into the subfloor. There was never any water on the floor, so I didn't realize there was a leak until over $6000 of damage had been done. The Watts insurance adjuster was nice and friendly and agreed that it certainly looked like the hose had caused my damaged wall and floors. He then took the hose ""for independent evaluation"". Turned out Watts evaluated its own hose and proclaimed ""no manufacturing defect"". Of course they refused to return the hose, so I had no proof. I will NEVER BUY A WATTS PRODUCT. Also, it didn't help that Home Depot wimped out and didn't support me against Watts."
4,"Good product, wrong supplier","The product is great. The supplier did not honor his Advertised price for a pair of these. So, I had to negotiate and pay a bit more."
1,the TC-930 stinks!,"When it arrived, I was disappointed in how difficult it was to see the phone LCD display (no back light, no contrast control). I change the greetings remotely, and after about one month, this feature ceased to function. After going through the proper channels, which means many long distance phone calls to California, Casio approved returning it to them for repair. I shipped it back, and in only another five weeks, it came back. Now it does not work at all. After speaking to Casio again (more long distance calls to California), they are encouraging me to continue to unplug it and re-set it all weekend, and on Monday they might approve my returning it again.Meanwhile, I have purchased a Uniden for less money, which works flawlessly.I will NEVER purchase another Casio product; anyone can make a lemon, but it takes a truly bad company to fail to correct their mistakes."
3,disappointing,"The phone is okay, but the sound quality is disappointing and the ringer annoying. It is comfortable to hold between one's head and shoulder. I have not used the ahswering machine."
5,So much fun you'll want to do it too!,"We received Sticky Mosaics Kids Art as a gift and have enjoyed every moment of it. My daughter (age 5) did 3 in one sitting the first time we opened it. She was supposed to be amusing herself but it looked so fun I gave it a try and kept dropping in to ""help"" her!We plan to give a couple as family Christmas gifts, and the rest she'll hang on her own wall. I'll likely buy something similar for her again, or as a gift for someone else."
4,Pretty good just not strong enough all the way through.,This CD is quite good. I really like several of the songs but a few are too instrumental and too long. Don't listen to the guy who apparently hates the world and gave them one star (he gave Intangible 5 and they suck). I think it is a pretty unique sound and I like it better after each listen.
2,Knowing when not to drum,"Yeah, this album starts off strong but the drumming (and I LOVE drums, I play drums and have CDs by drummers) gets so out of hand I find myself laughing at the music. Yes, the drummer can drum his ass off. He proves it 50 times in each song. But a large part of being a good drummer is knowing when to ease up. This guy has no governor. None. He will burn himself out just as he burns every song out. This CD wears out its welcome as soon as Pencil Fight is finished. If you have heard PF you have heard the drummers most nuanced performance. Oh, and the lead singer sounds like he spends his summers as a renaissance festival minstral."
2,Nothing new,"For me this band never quite did it. They had all the right talent, it just seems as though its all been done before. Although it is enjoyable to listen to, sometimes you think your listening to david drayman, sometimes staind, and then with the drumming its like kinda toolish, only not at all, kinda rips them off actually. I would instead recommend, tool, or apc. I'll probably forget about this album soon."
1,Better than Tool? Don't make me laugh,People keep saying how this band is better than Tool---No Way!!! This band should not even be compared to Tool. They are only lame hacks trying to sound like Flaw or Disturbed. Maynard is a rock god.Think for yourself---------------------Question Authority.
5,Atomship rocks my socks...hehehe,"When i was vacationing in South Carolina my brothers and i went to see a Flaw concert and Atomship opened for them. We got to the House of Blues early so we could get a good spot and as we're sitting there we hear some guy yell ""Are you ready to ROCK?!?!"" I had never heard of Atomship before so i had no clue who this crazed lunatic was but i was soon to find out this was their frontman. Joey was his name and he filled us in on his band and then he gave us a few nifty Atomship stickers. Then later when they came on stage i was blown away. They had such an awesome stage presence and i instantly loved their music. After the concert we sprinted to the merch table to buy their album and lemme tell you, it is so wicked! I really think that you should buy it!! Buy it now!!"
5,KAWAII!,Wow I love this manga the most of all! It is so cute! It has some touching (couldn't think of another word) moments. Like when Sakura canfesses her love to Yukito! Also Syaoran comforts Sakura by the swing set (that part is so cute! I wish I had a friend like Syaoran...) Eriol also causes more mayhem at the Shrine and Sakura and Syaoran once again work together. But my favorite parts are when Tomoyo keeps asking Syaoran if he told Sakura his feelings. It is very cute to see his reaction. You have to buy this! It is great!!!
5,Very cute.,Card captors is about a 5th grader girl with the magic of the clow cards which are these cards that each have there own magic.When Sakura relizes the clow master is going to die she must find out the 2 yes 2 people who will take his place. It is pretty easy to guess who they are but still reading the books is still alot of fun. Very cute books. Like in the second book Sakura gets attacked by a giant teddy bear!The art is great too.Great book for all ages and Tokyo mew mew and Salior Moon fans.(to tell you the truth I like this book even more then Salior Moon ^_^!)~*~Purin~*~
4,A Strong CD.,"This is relaxing, hypnotic music along the lines of that excellent band, ""The Sea and Cake."" I just got this CD and find that it provides useful background to writing or other mental activities. It adds a little bit of joy to one's day. I'm definitely going to look into their other releases based on my impressions of this record."
5,ONe of the best,"I have had a cassette tape of this Hap Palmer music which I use frequently in music classes.I was thrilled to find a CD! My favorite is ""Pause"" but all of the music invites movement. Tremendous find!"
1,Not Much Here For Nostalgia,"I owned this album in the early 90's during my thrash period. From what I remember it was fairly bland bargain basement stuff. ""Thugs Against Drugs"" was probably the only track that stood out."
2,An ambiguous oriented book,"The whole book serves as a software (NLogit) manual. If you already know about the discrete choice analysis, you might be able to find out the messages that the authors try to convey. And it contains barely new information, so it doesn't help you anyway. But if you are new to this area, this is not the good book for you to start.The book is extremely verbose and the ideas are hidden behind lines and ill-presented. It turned out that it's very difficult to comprehend the essence or even sense of the choice methods from this book. The best one can get is becoming a software user of the authors' own program.Besides, the software, Nlogit, is not user-friendly and can't serve as a mainsteam tool."
3,I so wanted to like this book!,"It could be me, but the writing / trains of thought seemed, well, shoddy. It's as if the writer just jumped around from thought to thought without elaborating on the main point of a section. Was there an editor involved? It read like a rough draft, which is disappointing because the topic is really, really worth exploring. We all could use a way to process our information overload."
3,Not horrible,"Well, I enjoyed it. In spite of all the negatives, was pretty good story line. The acting not so much, but was to be expected with only two actors in it. But I kinda like the fresh feel of no-names doing their best. The sound effects were terrible, the guns sounded like cap guns, I mean literally caps on black powder guns, and the guns all shot smoke like black powder guns too. Like I say, it was a pretty good story, fair acting, bad effects. But, given the lack of excellent to good movies from Amazon, it were a fair exchange of money. If you're bored & got the money, like westerns with a get together with your friends & make a movie feel, then by all means give it a shot. Pun intended pahdnah!"
4,Nice book,It's a classic for anyone interested in the truth to find in the bible. Although it is yellowed with age around the corner it's in admirable condition for it's age. Not to mention the fact it was kept in an attic for 20 some odd years. Complete with original cover. No visible marks or scratches.
3,Not their best but not even close to their worst,"I bought this album about a week after it came out and was a new fan at the time (I had purchased Propeller first-not the easiest way to start ;) ) There aren't the sheer quantity of good songs on this album as on say Isolation Drills. I find myself just going back and forth between ""Back to the Lake"" and Everywhere with Helicopter"". Not to say the others aren't good. The album as a whole however does not match up with some of their earlier stuff."
4,Another breath of fresh air. . . .,"Let me first state that after reading about GBV for several years, my first GBV purchase was Isolation Drills. I was crushed by the fabulous melodies, great guitar sounds (the guy from Jackson Hole is soft when he says Gillard's guitar work and sound is lousy, go back to your hole and stick to things you know about), and Pollard's vocals. I also acquired Bee Thousand a few months ago. That said, those of you who think BT is the end all, be all, need to get over it!! The songs are good, but recording quality detracts from the experience. Song snippets are fun, but never fully developed, as such the melodies suffer a little. Don't get me wrong, BT is great, but I prefer Drills and Universal Truths. Great songs as usual (Cheyenne, Christian Animation..., Eureka Signs, ...Helicopter, Universal Truths...). Overall still marginally prefer Drills, but either way its hard to lose with Pollard & GBV. The man is still THE ANSWER!"
4,More of the Everlasting Big Kick,"Ah, whether to proclaim Bob Pollard King of Short Songs, Head-Bop Caesar, Cut-to-the-Quick God of Hook, or Emperor of Thigh Melodics--aye, there's the rub. On this album, UTAC, Pollard and The Guided By Voices offer to you songs of lo and fi, pulled from the acres of the Pop Plantation. Consider at the outset: ""Wings of Thorn""; ""Christian Animation Torch Carriers"" (hard-core tuneage done up anthem-like); ""Storm Vibrations""; ""Back to the Lake"" (music of the spheres, like something out of the Magnapop Bible, King Bob Version)--best of all, if you don't mind me saying, being ""Wire Greyhounds"". Those of you who, like me, when asked for the primest GBV reach single-handedly for ""Under the Bushes, Under the Stars,"" prepare for similar heights. It is strong, it is sturdy, it is always true. Announce it."
4,something's amiss,"universal truths and cycles, guided by voices thirteenth album, has the best of intentions. all it lacks is color. every GbV record has a flavor all its own. not this one. as a return to his lo-fi roots (sort of), pollard and company deny it the opportunity to exist on its own terms. no doubt this is a very good record, and much better than what was to follow, it just doesn't feel organic. that said, pretty bombs is the bomb! a great song. and there are others: back to the lake, skin parade. the machine that was guided by voices was just losing inerta."
1,"UPON FURTHER REVIEW, THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR","Ive had this mess of an album for over 2 months. Robert Pollard is back with yet another Who-inspired lenghty mess of an album. Pollard, one of the best songwriters of the early 90's, has missed again. Gone are the wonderful melodies of GBVs early work. Now we have 3 chord / power-chord guitar driven boredom. This band has the worst guitarist I've ever heard. Bee Thousand and Alien Lanes were brilliant. Not much since then has been worth much with the exception of Isolation Drills. Even still, Pollard has succeeded in becoming as boring as the Who. I cannot understand how someone who has heard Bee Thousand, Alien Lanes, Propeller and Vampire on Titus can even listen to this without wanting to toss the cd. ... I dont get it."
3,Filler...,"Filler...that is what most of this album is. There are the few gems here, like ""Cheyenne"" and the last song, ""Father Sgt. Christmas Card"". But what is missing here is a Mr. Tobin Sprout and the original line-up of GBV. Pollard and Sprout were the equivalent to McCartney and Lennon. These songs just don't have the emotion or super hooks they once did. I wish Pollard would stick to the crummy old 4-track, shack up with is original band, have a few beers...and let the songs roll. This is STILL better than almost anything out in the music market nowadays though. The only bands that are keeping the underground alive are GBV, Modest Mouse, etc. Compare albums such as Alien Lanes or Under the Bushes, Under the Stars to this album and one will be let down. There is MUCH more creativity and ebb and flow on those albums.It is sad, Pollard has returned to Matador (which is great!), but he forgot to bring his good music back with him."
2,Out with the money...out with the quality,"Having truly enjoyed the last two Guided By Voices cds...and not caring for the basement sound of Bee Thousand (no matter how good the songs are..if they are recorded badly and sung off key...)I guess the Voices couldn't sell enough records to satisfy ""the man"" and they returned to this. Too bad. There are many songs here, but few of them will make it into my ipod. I wish Bob Pollard would remember the muse that inspired ""Teenage FBI"", Hold On Hope"" (my favorite song and recently used quite effectively on ""Scrubs"") and ""Brides Have Hit Glass"" .Forget the 30 second song..let the tune grow, even Elvis Costello gave up on them after Get Happy. Buy this one if you are a fan...but not anyone else."
4,good jam from late '97,"big pun gives this tune a very nice flavour at the introcatchy chorus as well ~""its off the hook this yearmakin mad money off the books this yearain't nuthin but crooks in heregettin mad money off the books this year""...definitely deserves a repeat spin or two everytime..."
2,Type 11 Error,"Sadly, I found this book to be mostly tedious, with irritating ""literary"" tendencies and repetition. Using the PowerBook theme, naming the chapters after recognizable phrases from the Macintosh user interface, is cute, but seems mostly to be a gimmick.He found the shifting perspectives to be an aggravation, especially when executed for the apparent purpose of re-exploring the same events. As he got off the plane, he was not terribly disappointed to find that he had left the book in the seat pocket, despite the occasionally witty or thought-provoking ideas that could be found scattered throughout the text."
5,I never had erotic thoughts about tulips before this book...,"Ms. Winterson does it again.A novel for the information age, just when we all thought computers would spell the death of literature! This is a book to read..no savor...several times. I loved it.Oh...and I look at tulips in a whole new way..."
1,insufferably trendy,"This is perfect if you like affected characters, trite romantic fantasies, comic book versions of classic stories, and snippets of sexual cliches."
1,Fake Depth,"Winterson's early books, such as ""Sexing the Cherry"" had the power of a mind that knows magic, but hasn't been told it knows. Now, Winterson burdens us with mental plaque--her miniscule issues placed under a distorted microscope. She has lost the touch of youth. What a treasure to have lost! Certainly there are a few sentences sprinkled here and there that penetrate, but they are nothing compared to the cerebral baptism of freedoms previously offered up."
3,Just a little too disjointed,"I'm all for intelligent narrative. I'm all for making the reader exert an effort to understand, to excavate meaning. However, this work tips in to the realm of literary acid trip, leaving me feeling like I've only glimpsed psychedelic fragments of the story. The characters aren't particularly likable, and their lives aren't particularly interesting.As with all of Winterson's work, there are those breathtaking turns of phrase that make you want to highlight the text with a yellow marker. They are fewer and further between in this book, though."
3,Not a book for the plot-driven reader,"I found The Powerbook a beautifully written book. Winterson takes the subject of love and avoids every cliche', turning it into something fresh, lovely and ""ruinous"", as she puts it. It is at once mythological and modern, weaving between the two with almost flawless movement. Warning, it is NOT a plot-driven book, and seemed to me more like an extended prose poem than a novel. My only complaint was that I was less captivated by the modern love story in the novel than I was by the retelling of classic love stories. All in all, it is a beautiful, lyrical book filled with some of the most startling and vivid imagery I have read in a long time."
4,At your own risk!,"I have always admired Jeanette Winterson. The Passion is one of my favorite novels. I had been anticipating the release of this new novel, for it focuses on cyberspace.Ali, an e-mail writer, has prepared a game for you. You can enter the realm of virtual reality and go everywhere you want and do anything you want to do. However, you also risk discovering things about yourself that you may not have wanted. Like all Winterson's previous novels, it has a surreal approach to romance. Also, there is the ambiguity of sexual preference and/or identity. Still, the risk is worth taking. This is a fabulous novel. The magical realism is there! Winterson has never let me down! Read it, at your own risk!"
3,Not Quite,"She makes a decent attempt, but I find myself wishing that Sarah Vaughan were singing the songs.This album came highly recommended, and I like it. But it is not authentic; something is missing. I decided to look for some Sarah Vaughan albums after listening to this."
5,Roger Sanchez=AWESOME W/Release Yourself,"I was listening today to the tracks from this CD on Dance Music Channel TV, and the whole CD is TERRIFIC. Boy, it made me wanna move and move. No stopping.....The music(every track) was as HOT as the next.Mr Sanchez, you really did it good with this CD.Congratulations!"
3,too tight,"I have a fiem ralph lauren pillow and this king size pillow case is too tight on it but the feel of the cotton is great, soft delicate and not silky!"
2,2-pack flood safe hoses,Very disappointed in the delivered item. This item was advertised as a 2-pack but I received only 1 hose. Seller would not send an additional. Seller claimed that the ad was incorrect.
5,Read the book. Transform your organization.,"I don't often review Amazon purchases. This one was different. It literally changed the direction of the organization that I serve in. I read it in one sitting (not recommended, I had a migraine the next day). Buy it now!"
4,Good book for implementing change.,A bit repetitive but it gets the point across about the importance of having good policies in place. A good step-by-step book.
1,Must be full of secret treasure,"$22 for a Kindle edition?? As smart as the Carvers are, they would be well-advised to study the concept of price elasticity."
2,"Back then, perhaps...","When Falk wrote HTWR, it probably gave more information to the aspiring author than any other reference of the time. However, there are several books out there now with greater value to writers of women's fiction. The articles Falk includes, written by some great authors, are interesting but not very helpful in teaching the craft. Most books available today that are created for romance writers give a more specific overview of the requirements and secrets of this genre. HTWR just doesn't compare."
4,Excellent reference for it's time,"I read this years ago, and for it's time(when it was published) it was the only reference tool on how to write a good romance and sell it to the publishers. The only reason I didn't rate it higher is the vast and rapid changes in the romance market since then. But the articles by such people as Bertrice Small, and other romance role-models still make it a must buy, if for nothing but those :)"
2,So-so...,"This book could do with a thorough revision. Much of it is heavily dated.There are a few really good essays, especially the ones on how to research and organize your research. Those essays are invaluable. I also appreciate the suggestions on whose romances to read to see the craft of writing in action. These lists too need updating so we can look for books that reflect today's market.But most of the essays on writing frustrated me. The authors only state what to do and rarely give much explanation on HOW to do it. The essays are much too short and not at all comprehensive. They're certainly interesting as a look at what authors say they do in writing romances, but not very instructive in teaching others how to do it.If Ms. Falk revises this book, I would strongly suggest asking the authors to revise their essays to include more description of how-to mechanics."
5,Stories with Heart,"I think the two best stories in this collection are ""Cathedral"" and ""A Small, Good Thing"". While ""Cathedral"" probably has received the most attention of all the stories in this collection, I like ""A Small, Good Thing"" better. At the heart of the story is a sense of tenderness and compassion that is rare in contemporary fiction. The last scene moves one to see all differences are minor compared to what we all endure."
2,"Fragmentary, trivial...even a little dull","This was pretty much a disappointment. Carver was The Man in the 1980s, widely celebrated for his realistic, gritty portrayals of everyday life among average white folks, and I liked his stuff when I first read it back then too. But this time, I was no longer enchanted. His stories often seem dull, flat, too focused on minor details. And the picture of life among hard-drinking, clock-punching regular people that emerges hardly seems like the whole picture. A few of the stories are very good, like ""Vitamins"" for example. And there is the weird story about the guys who go on fishing trip and find a girl's body, then just ignore it for a couple of days while they continue to fish and fool around. This seems to touch on something essential between men and women. But other stories seem trivial and fragmentary. Maybe I am being a little too harsh on Carver - he certainly has many fans, and I used to like his writing - but this is my honest reaction to it today."
2,Unpolished stories from the drawer,"I hate to give Carver a bad review, especially because I loved the stories in ""What we talk about when we talk about love"", but every story I read in this volume, and I admit I have not read them all, was a huge let down.They dont pick up and end threadless, leaving me with a big HUH? You might say, I am just too ignorant, but I love short stories, and dont want to give this book a thumbs down, but here it is. No good. It seems the publishers just put together anything by Carver without really checking for quality again, like selling Picasso's doodles for a million bucks. We dont always create masterpieces, and ""Where I'm calling from"" disappoints."
1,"A fruitless, frustrating read.","I am sorry to say that I have tried several times to read that book, recommended by an excellent writer friend of mine, and simply failed to finish it every time. My dislike of Raymond Carver(like my dislike for New York) feels to me like a shortcoming but there you have it. There are no points to Carver's stories and I find it infinitely arid and unrewarding to read short pointless stories with no aim. Lack of resolution you call it? To me, it goes against the very appeal of reading. I can't remember the stories, I can't remember the characters and I don't care. Doesn't that mean that Carver fails somewhere? Why do we read if not to be entertained, moved, to learn something, to travel to another universe? I'm a lifelong reader, but the supposed wonders of Mr. Carver fly way over my head."
4,Honest & Deep,"For anyone who loves the art of the short story. Raymond Carver may have been one of the greatest short story writers of modern American literature, and in this collection we get his best. ""Cathedral"" is a work of art that one gets more from with each reading. In this story we get Carver's unique take on perception. His characters are working class people with common flaws, and everyday humanity. In ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"", we spend time with two couples who discuss meaningful issues without pulling any punches, and Carver has no place for false sentimentality. ""The Calm"", and ""Gazebo"" are two others that stand out in this rich collection."
5,Excellent Stories,"Raymond Carver is one of my favorite American writers. Here in Japan, R.Carver is known by the effort of Haruki Murakami's translation and I also became a R.C. fan through his works.I think Haruki's translation is excellent but I prefer to read in original texts in spite of lack of my command of English. These short stories are full of heartrending sorrows, clumsiness of men and women, and shapes of love."
5,Carver Rocks,"Carver rocks. It's that simple. If you're not still thinking about these stories long after you close the book then.. well, he's just not for you."
3,I'm not a big Carver fan.,"I admire his technique and his influence, but most of his work to me seems formulaic. My favorite stories in this collection are the later ones from his book Cathedral, especially ""Cathedral,"" ""Feathers,"" and ""A Small, Good Thing."" Those are much more rich and interesting and humane than his earlier stories. Those three stories are so great, they made this whole book worthwhile for me."
4,not bad at all,"some great stories, although maybe i'm not deep enough to understand all of them. it seems to me, however, that Carver is more of a modern Hemingway then any visionary original writer. the style, i mean, seems very similar to Hemingway's."
5,Great faucet for the laundry room,"If you've seen what's available at your local Home Depot, Lowes, this blows them away. Well made and it's easy to turn on/off."
2,Not impressed. Plastic base and handles. Thin metal spout.,Threaded spout end is not garden hose threded as it should be. Why? Because a garden hose thread is slightly larger and might cost 25 cents extra to manufacture.Moen now value engineers its products. This is a $15 item for sale at $38.
3,Mastered from Vinyl....,"My main reason for buying this compilation was to finally have Johnny's top ten hit ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" on CD. Unfortunately, while much of the disc sounds very clean despite the use of vinyl records for mastering (which I didn't know until I got the disc), ""Yellow Rose"" suffers from the most noticeable hiss and noise. Much of the CD sounds very good though, and it's good to see an attempt made to preserve the songs.The note on the back of the disc reads ""While every effort has been made to eliminate the surface noise from the original 78 rpm recordings used for this issue, including use of the CEDAR audio noise reduction system, some slight surface noise may remain."""
2,"Tepid, but an improvement","""Ravishing Grimness"" was awful and this album corrects many of those problems, but still doesn't rise above burnt out and so ends up being pleasant black-metal-y background music. Fenriz and company have the black metal science refined to formula, and the resulting pop sounds nearly like surf music from an apocalyptic world. Guitars saw through toneful and melodic riffing but always return to a Celtic-Frost-influenced darkness and disharmony. It's bouncy in rhythm and the vocals are as always great, but there's nothing here to draw a repeat listen. It is wiser to enjoy this band at their prime."
5,Hails!,This is an excellent black metal cd. The best i have heard that has came out this year. No band can come close to the coldness and BRILLANT lyrics. hail darkthrone!
4,"""Nothing Amounts To Nothing""...Fenriz","Dark Throne are the mighty Norwegian legends of Black Metal. They have produced some of the coldest Black Metal known to man. So how does Plague Wielder compare to previous efforts? To sum it up, imagine Ravishing Grimness with a more polished sound. Also, Fenriz's drumming is more technical on this release. From the opening riff of Weakling Avenger to the closing notes of Wreak (in my opinion, the best song of Plague Wielder), Dark Throne have remained true to their trademark sound and there are no unwelcome surprises. My only complaint is of the album's artwork. It's a bit too colorful for Dark Throne."
2,Boring...Sorry. :(,"I bought this video based on the high reviews it got. However, my three year old [who loves all of our other spanish learning videos] hated it and refuses to watch it. She thinks it is very boring and I kind of agree. So, it may be a great video, but since my kid won't watch it, it does us no good at all."
3,not very interesting,"This is an OK video, but not worth all the high marks it has earned. It has one monotone womans voice saying spanish words for actions shown on the screen. There really isn't much action or ""feeling"" in the voice. Some of the images are confusing It reminds me of my adult Spanish learning tapes which are very boring. MY 2 year old loves videos but she doesn't seem overly impressed with this one. She does perk up at some of the images (ballons, dog, kittens, exc..) but overall there isn't much to keep her attention."
3,"A nice investment, but lacks variety and movement","I purchased baby bilingual French and Spanish about a month ago. The Baby Bilingual series is a great idea, but don't expect baby to be engrossed in the images on the screen as he or she might be with other baby videos.The music in the background is nice, classical music. The visual component is nice, as well, and shows real life people and toys. My one year old enjoys watching the videos, but they don't hold her attention as well as other classical music based baby videos have done. I would have liked to see more movement and variety on the screen to hold my babie's attention better.The videos don't hold my attention too well either, as both the French and Spanish versions are very similiar (actually, almost identical) as they show almost identical visuals and teach baby exactly the same words. Again, more variety would have been nice."
3,Decent but not great,"I was looking for some heavy bottomed cocktail glasses to replace an old set that is mostly gone. These don't have the bottom heft that I was hoping for but they are better than more conventional glasses. The quality of the glass does not seem very high. One of the glasses chipped on the edge in its first pass through the dishwasher, and went directly to the garbage. The others are in use and are fine so far. I will be keeping my eye out for higher quality replacements for these."
3,Sound is muffled this is not original LP,I have original LP. This one is so much worse that I'll probably put it for exchange. Andy
2,Not quite what it appears,"The textured look in the photo is misleading; this tape is flat with a white pattern printed over it. The photos suggest a flexible vinyl tape suitable for affixing to clothing. It seems reasonably reflective, but it's thin and stiff, kind of like cheap electrical tape, and the corners are already peeling off my jacket's nylon shell.I had previously bought this tape from another vendor:aerostich .com/adhesive-3m-solas-grade-reflective.htmlMuch better quality. Wish I'd bought from them again."
3,Not as good as the other tape....,"This is not as thick as the other tape and it tears more easily. It sticks ok.THis ti the thick tape with a goof backing....Reflexite REF-DB Retroreflective Daybright Tape: 2 in. x 15 ft. (Fluorescent Orange).If you want a rugged tape, that will last, go with this one."
3,Basic-but better than nothing!,"This is very basic budgeting software but the cost is low and will at least get you pointed in the right direction of your budgeting plan. The price is next to nothing so it's hard to complain about its lack of features. The seller was quick, I wouldn't shy away from ordering from them again."
3,"Not bad, but....","This box set is not bad, but if you already purchased the DVD called ""The greatest"" you can save your money.It seems that NFL films just re-releases again and again the same DVD videos adding a couple of 2 minute clips. It's true that this time they added a whole dvd dedicated to hall of famers speeches, but the really interesting one is the documentary that was already released a few years ago. I wish that NFL films should warn us for these kind of things."
3,Repeat Of Greatest Players And Coaches,"This product includes a DVD which was issued as Greatest Players And Coaches (I think that's the title) and the extra DVDs aren't that exciting, player speeches and click-on-here player profile menu that shows very little videos. Videos and info that you have to click to watch, can't seem watch all continiously, no Play All feature, so it's bothersome to click on each name at a time. Disappointingly, I already had the Greatest Players/Coaches DVD, so when I bought this set, it felt like buying something I already had, and the bonus discs are the lesser parts of the set."
3,NFL,"It is good packaged and has a lot of information, i was a little dissapointed in the disc with the hall of fame speeches it cut some out and did not have the intrduction speakers on it. But it gave a good account. The disc with highlights was good."
5,Delivered quickly & gift recipient loved it.,This was a Christmas gift & the recipient was very pleased to receive it. He is a football coach and athletic director - who is difficult to impress!
3,"Well, OK","Interestin content and presentation for an NFL fan, but I was a little disappointed that there was very little historical footage, which is what I was looking forward to seeing. All in all, though, a strong OK."
3,BS Price for a so-so Shoe,"This is the shoe worn by James Bond in Casino Royale, so they upped the price on it, because you are supposed to be impressed. Too bad it wasn't the shoe Don Knotts wore in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken."
2,import charge!! outrageous,"Product as expected, BUT having to pay an extra 42 IMPORT CHARGE that was not expected as company never informed us. We had to pay over 30 P&P!!!!! NOT HAPPY....."
4,great but 2 big inconveniences,This camcorder is very small and very simple but1/ it takes horrible still pictures2/ I haven't been able to find a simple little pouch for it. I called JVC and they told me they didn't even make one ! unbelievable.If anyone has found a compatible pouch please let me know !thanks
2,Zoom trouble too,"I am experiencing the same zooming trouble as everyone else. When I called JVC they denied the problem. Judging from the reviews here on Amazon.com, there seems to be a very real problem. I bought the camera because it was simple, afforadable, and I'm not much of a techno person. I used it well for over a year when the zoom problem started. Being in the military, you don't get much pay, so I was hoping this camera would serve me for a long time- I was wrong. I will not buy JVC products again! Anyone for a class action lawsuit?"
2,"Worked ok for about a year, then the zoom problems started...","I bought this about an year ago. It worked fine till about a month ago. The first thing that I noticed is that the camera would zoom in all by itself. I had to have my finger firmly holding the zoom out button so that it would not zoom in. Reading about it now, I find out that this is a common problem with this particular camcorder. Wish I had read reviews from people who had been using this for a while. Most of the reviews (when I bought it) were from people who were happy with it and had it for less than couple of weeks.It was good while it lasted. But I would never buy JVC again."
1,Zoom issue is a deal breaker,"I bet this would be a decent camcorder, if the zoom issue wasn't there. It's apparently a major glitch with this model. I bought mine new, used it without incident for about three or four months and then it began zooming at will. It zooms all the way in when you turn it on, and won't stay at any other level of zoom. I sent it in under the parts warranty, but JVC authorized service people wanted over $200 for labor. I paid to have it fixed, it came back still broken, sent it back in, and within two months it started doing the same thing. I despise this camcorder and JVC. Their customer service people are rude, they routinely do not returns calls or emails and they sell a very expensive product that doesn't work properly."
1,Do not buy this item!,"I purchased a JVC GR-DX77us last july and to be fair, its video-taping capabilities are good, and the resolution is good. However, I have not been able to get the video capture feature to work on the camcorder. I tried both the USB and the 1394 firewire, and they both kept losing contact with various computers--turns out the problem was the plug board is pretty loose and either the plugs or the board loses contact regularly, playing havoc with your computer. I was not able to download one minute of footage.Dont expect any great help from JVC customer support either, every inquiry or request to them turned into an escalation to buy something else, 4 out of 5 times it was for accessories that were supposed to have been included in the camera kit.stay away from this model, and JVCs in general."
1,Worst game ever - not just among pirate games,"This is literally the worst game that I have ever played of ANY genre. Comparing it to the original Pirates! by Sid Meier is very nearly an insult to that classic game. Simply put, this game has a terrible user interface, gameplay is difficult and BORING (gameplay refers to ship-to-ship combat, navigating through towns and swordfighting) and is incredibly BUGGY (as in constant crashing). Honestly, this is an insult for Bethesda to release to the gaming public in light of their other games (as in the Elder Scrolls series). Unfortunately, if a pirate game is what you are looking for, then this is about the only game out right now. I'd recommend, however, that you save your money and wait to get a game worth playing. Or at least a game thats FUN to play."
1,Great Concept - Very Poor Execution,This game looks like a lot of fun - but it will fade very quickly. You get killed thousands of times. The merchant system is infantile. You will be boarded and killed over and over. Don't waste your time or money. Try something else.
3,Would be more fun if it was easier,"Even with the patch (v1.06) which lets you select Easy difficulty level, the game is still pretty hard. The ship you start off with is absolutely pathetic! You have the weakest cannons, so the range is shorter requiring you to get super close to the enemy ships who then just pound you because they have more, better cannons. Then if you try to board, you die. I haven't successfully boarded a ship yet. One swipe from the enemy captain and I die. Isn't that a bit silly? So to build up your ship and cannons, you have to travel back and forth between the same two islands trading goods. Very frustrating. Yet somehow despite these frustrations, I feel like if I can just get better there is fun to be had. Will give it a couple more games and see..."
2,Fun but only when it actually works,I've been waiting for a Pirates game since the original Pirates from ten years ago. This one was fun and seemed to have some good potential. But that's only when you can get it to work. I have a machine that should run this game very smoothly and even with everything upgraded it freezes all the time and is more buggy than any other game I've played. And the patch 1.06 only caused more problems than it fixed. Also techincal support for it was basically non existant. I've also gone to the forums for the game and the general feeling is that they created the game and then went AWOL when the customers looked for help with the problems in it. I gave it two stars because it is pretty fun when you can get it to work.
4,Razo brake pedal,Very large break pedal bought with same gas pedal both required alittle reworking to get secured to my existing pedals but they look cool and stay firmly in place.
5,Great Introduction to International Film for children,"Miss Minoes, which was released theatrically just a few months ago, is a wonderful film to serve as an introduction to foreign cinema for children. The upcoming DVD will release with two audio tracks: One is the original Dutch with English subtitles and the second is a well done English dubbing. This permits children to choose how they might want to listen to it. The theatrical was in English and my 11 yr old and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The story is of a feline who turns into a young woman and befriends a journalist who is in desperate need of news to keep his job. The feline/woman enlists the help of the local cats who begin to serve as a news gathering service.The premise of Miss Minoes is adorable. The cats are adorable and the story line is well paced for 7-12 year olds. If you happen to be a fan of Russian Blues, even better, as there is a host of kittens."
4,charming,This is a lovely little dutch film based on an old childrens story in the Netherlands. Its dubbed in english and is a cute film for older children.
3,"Cute, but not the greatest","I was so drawn in by the preview of this movie, that I went ahead and purchased instead of renting. Big mistake! For one thing, I didn't realize that this was a German film and DUBBED to English. But that could have just been my oversight, and ultimately didn't ruin the movie for me. It was the slow pace and lack of decent dialogue and humor that led me to only give it 3 stars. I didn't go any lower, because it's not like I'm ANGRY that I saw this movie, but I guarantee, I'll never watch it again. While I might say give this one a shot if it's on t.v. and you're REALLY fond of cats, I certainly wouldn't advocate spending money on it."
2,It was dubbed in English,Should make it clear in the description it was dubbed in English. I could not finish watching it and it looked so cute.
2,Dooms Night (Revisited) - Azzido Da Bass,"German CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""DOOMS NIGHT (REVISITED)"" - AZZIDO DA BASS1) Stanton Warriors Radio Edit - 3:362) Stanton Warriors Vocal Mix - 5:533) Stanton Warriors Dub - 6:172000"
5,Good entertainment.. GREAT FOR FILMMAKERS,"I've been working making a documentary and with other filmmakers for a couple of years.. Always trying to learn.. I figured it would be great to see what the students in the schools do that I could never afford. This is a really fun masterpiece.. you don't really get anything very technical, but get to see a lot totally dysfunction people working on films..I've lent this out to several people so far.. you know they actually liked it when they come back to you and tell you about it.. if it sucked they would never really say anything.. This people like to talk about. Its like another doc ""Hands on the Hardbody"" except about film students..I looked forward everyday to watching the next installment, was bummed when it was done.Tons of fun.. you might actually learn a few things too.I highly recommend it even if nothing more than entertainment."
3,Interesting,This doc-series details the struggles of a handfull of young filmmakers trying to finish their projects. An interesting look at the life of a film student. How did she think she would actually get a MONKEY!??
3,Glass ball gets cloudy,"I dont know if it is some supermicrobes or what in that little glass ball but after a few weeks of getting this, the ball completely clouded up and you can barely see the baby dragon. At first it was kinda cool because it did that whole frosty-looking thing, but now its just all cloudy and it looks dirty. The statue itself is cool though."
4,"Very good, but not complete.","This is an excellent guide to commercial RV parks, but there are quite a few public campgrounds not listed. Also, because this book is loaded with RV park advertisements, Woodall's won't make any negative comments. Although this guide is of no use to tent campers, nevertheless, every RVer should have one."
4,evening music,"I found this album in a shop in the airport and liked the sound of the woman's silky voice. The jacket lists her as Anne Lise, but Amazon's online description doesn't list any artists' names. I'd like to know more about her, but can't be sure the names that pop up during search are the same person. I can surely recommend this album for easy relaxing listening, and hope I can find another to add to my collection."
5,SUPERB !!!,"I first heard this cd at the gift shop of the ""Hotel Del Coronado"" in San Diego California. Inmediately, I fell in love with it, they were asking U$S 18 plus tax and I thought I could get it somewhere else for a lower price. My second chance was at ""Amoeba Music"" in Holywood California and they didn't have it. Finally when I came back home (Argentina) I search for it at Amazon.com and bought it on November 17th. Last friday, November the 25th coming back home from my ""Wedding Party"" the CD was expecting me !!! It couldn't have arived in a most proper time !!! Family, Friends, The Bride & The Groom (myself) started enjoying it thoroughly !!! Do Not think twice !!! Buy it Now!!! It's wonderful!!! My gratitude and appreciation goes to: ""MAINSTREAMMEDIA"" for sending it so fast. Jorge E. Posse - Buenos Aires - Argentina"
3,Hoof Lacque,This product peals off your nails every quickly and I was looking for something to strength my nails. Maybe I didn't buy the right product. Can you let me know.
2,not impressed,"Works well when it stays on, but needs to be re-applied every other day or so. Probably would not recommend."
5,Hard Nails,"Healty Hoof is excellent, makes your nails tough you can feel it working as soon as you put it on. Looks nice without polish,or you can put it on first and then your polish."
1,do horses really use this,"I was very disappointed. Do people really use this on their horses. I put it on clean nails and within a day, it was peeling off like celophane! I wash my hands, do dishes, and take a shower - just like any human, and probably less than any horse - but the stuff did not last. Sad product. I did get a refund though."
1,hoof laquer,"It is cheap in price....so you get what you pay for. It peels off within the first day, it does not help your nails in any way. I was looking for a product to truely harden my nails."
1,Healthy Hoof Lacquer,This product is not any different from any other top coat out there. It does not prevent chipping any longer than a few hours. I used it and the same day my nail polish chipped. Awful!
1,disappointing :(,"It doesn't stay on at all. It peels off the same day. How can it strengthen your nails, if it doesn't even stay on? I'm very disappointed. Waste of money!"
2,Not impressed,"I bought for the first time and used it yesterday. I am not impressed at this point. I had 3 chipped nails this morning. I hadn't done anything except wash my hair. One post mentioned this is a top coat. (I know that top coats and base coats are different). I used 2 coats as a base, then 2 coats of an Orly polish and one coat as a topcoat. I will give it one more try as a topcoat only and see what happens. I had thought this was a nail strengthener/hardener, and those are used on the bare nail. If this doesn't adhere to the bare nail then it wouldn't do much as a strengthener."
5,Healthy Hoof Lacquer,"This product is wonderful! It keeps the nail polish on longer, strengthens the nails, is very shiny and very reasonably priced. I love it!! I have been using it for a long time and am glad I found it online since I can't get it in the drug store anymore. The seller is wonderful. The amount ordered came quickly and was in very good shape. Good, safe packaging kept the small glass bottles from breaking in transit. I highly recommend the product and would definitely use this seller again."
3,okay,"This product strengthens your nails, but only when it stay on. The next day after applying it, it peels like crazy. Even with 2 coats, it won't stay on. I haven't applied it over polish yet, maybe it will work better."
2,nylon,"This cap is nylon and it doesn't keep my husband's head warm, having cancer he needs to have the cotton ones as they are warmer."
3,"Don't let the word ""Introduction"" fool you","I bought this book based on a recommendation at a web site that contained basic electronics-tutorials, but it is really too advanced for a beginner. I found it too hard to follow. (I also bought ""RF Circuit Design"" by Chris Bowick, which I found easier to follow, though it still helped that there are some things I know about electronics that weren't covered in the tutorials where I found the recommendation.)To be fair, the introduction to this edition says it is for ""the working engineer"" and ""ADVANCED radio amateur"" (emphasis mine). People in those classes may find it more useful. I wish I knew that before I ordered it.I don't think I should say how many stars this book deserves because I am not in the intended audience, but Amazon insists that I select a number of stars, so I picked 3."
3,Terrible Title,"I bought ""Introduction to Radio Frequency Design"" because thats exactly what I was looking for. I'm your average electronics hobbyist looking for an introduction to things like oscillators, frequency synthesis, RF filters, modulation techniques and other basics that relate to designing RF circuits. What I got was a book that focuses heavily (almost exclusively) on modeling RF circuits mathematically which makes the book almost useless for me and others looking for such ""introductory"" material. This book assumes that you've have all the mathematical and physics training that comes with something like an electrical engineering degree, so if that describes you and your interested in maximizing your RF circuits, then this may be the book for you. But if your interested in actual introductory material to basic RF design I'd suggest you find something else."
4,Easy to read,This book was recommended by a fellow employee. The book is easy to read without excessive mathematics as found in a school text. It is not exhaustive but does cover some RF subject matters. This is a good book for someone that needs to learn more about the RF side of electronics.
5,Great Tennessee Vols Book,"If you are interested in the history of Vols football and Neyland Stadium this is a great read. It's full of historic photo's as well as a gameday chapter full of some very beautiful and recent pcitures from gameday at Neyland. I own a few Vol books, this is my favorite."
4,Still the Queen of Country Music,"It's hard to believe so few people seem appreciative of this type of music. If it wasn't for pioneers like Loretta, there would be no Shanias, Wynonnas, Faiths, LeAnns, Dixie Chicks, etc. Country has strayed so far from its origins, but Loretta still sounds exactly like she did when she first started many years ago. It nice to know someone can stay true to their roots and continue to put out wonderful quality music. I had the pleasure of seeing Miss Lynn live in concert in May, 2001, and heard some of the songs from this album there. Until that concert, I didn't even know she had put out a new album because I'm sure it got lost in the shuffle of all the artists out there. But this is the real deal. Her heartbreaking tribute to her late husband, ""I Can't Hear the Music,"" is worth the price of the album alone. What a beautiful voice and awesome talent."
3,Elephunky,"I believe Simon Cowel said it best, ""it was good but it wasn't great,"" and that fits this cd perfectly. While this cd is nice, it isn't terrific. There are in fact some nice songs on here, but for every ""Shut Up"" there is another ""Latin Girls"".Some of the songs that highlight this album are ""Let's Get Retarded"", ""Hey Mama"", ""Shut Up"", ""Fly away"", and ""The Apl Song"" and ""Hand's Up"" and ""Labor Day"" are alright. But even the last two are on the border line. They released ""Where Is The Love?"" which annoyed me to death, but I'm glad I kept an open mind and listened to their other work, because other wise I would have skipped right past this cd.The Black Eyed Peas are a good group, and I love Fergie because she can sing well. This group needs to get better songs though that aren't so centered around Will.I.Am and need to focus on the rest of the group as welll."
5,Yea that's phunky...Elephunk Rocks,"Elephunk is off the wall; this is one of the best albums i've ever heard. BEP's affective use of varieties of hip-hop and funk sounds lead to pure listening pleasure. They mix some of the most positive and creative rhymes in with sensational beats on this 13 track album. Will.i.am and Apl.de.ap of bep were the leaders in the creation Elephunk, and they left no room for improvement; I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys new sounds and diverse hip-hop music. Elephunk ROCKS!...literally: track 12 ""anxiety"" displays bep and papa roach's talents as the hip-hop and rock blend together to form a hardcore song."
3,Not Normal BEP,"This CD is nowhere near the quality of a normal BEP cd. With tracks such as Shut Up, it appears they were geared towards a mainstream or radio audience. For a group that has made albums such as Bridging The Gap and Behind THe Front, this album is not near a 5 star rating like it is recieving. I love Black Eyed Peas, but this album was just a let down."
4,Different: Yes. Worse: No,"I read A lot of people criticing this album becuase it is not what they are used to hearing from the Black Eyed Peas. It does have a more vibe pop feeling to it (partly because Timberlake is singing Background vocals on where is the love). The addition of the beautiful Fergie adds a different feeling to this music, which makes it good in my opinion. Also people have been critizing this album because it is degrading of people with handicaps (Track 3 Lets Get Retarded). That is one of the most laughable things Ive heard in my laugh. Lets get retarded is about as bad as saying Lets get hype or something along those lines. If they says Cripples suck or something like that then I would see it was time to break out the picketing signs. Take My Advice and listen to this album before you take into consideration dumb comments like that."
3,itsallright,yeah it's pretty good not as groundbreaking as their first and no real monster jams but acceptable
4,Dorothy! Where am I??,"Ok, I am a little bit off the beat'n path with this review...it's definitely not my genra of expertise.But I really like how this one makes me feel! It's a ""feel good"" poppy hip-hoppy kind of thing. Nice meaty dance beats and some really good songwriting in my opinion. It may not be true to the ""gun-slinging, ho-boppin'"" writing styles of most hip-hop/rap I hear these days...which is probably one reason why I like it so much."
2,Overrated,"I can't believe the glowing reviews for this album here. I read them, and once I got the album, I was utterly disappointed. The first time I listened to it I thought it was ok, but after having it for 5 months I have deleted every song from my playlist except ""Hands Up"" and ""Let's Get Retarded."" These aren't even good songs, they're just catchy. The ""funk"" influenced songs sound forced and repetitive, and some of the songs flat out suck. With ""Elephunk,"" the Black-Eyed Peas have gone from a respectable ""Roots""-like psuedo-underground outfit to a weak, commercial, radio-friendly, Justin Timberlake-featuring crew. If this album was so tight, it wouldn't have so many positive reviews on amazon.com"
2,next please,"If you are on the fence with buying this cd, I'd say move along to the next one... or at the very least preview/borrow from a friend before you drop the cash. While ""shut up"", ""hey mama"", and ""where is the love"" got the radio play they deserve, I can't say that I think many other songs from this album will be released. I find the lyrics pretty lame and elementary - bubble gum pop (funk?). Especially ""smells like funk"" - this song may perhaps turn you off the entire album. I know that BEP has a pretty strong fan base, so they must be doing something right, but from someone who bought the cd for the 3 aforementionned songs, I would encourage you to preview before you buy."
4,Can you feel it?,"My second favorite BEP album next only to Monkey Business. With the addition of Fergie they are creating a better and fuller sound which they perfect in Monkey Business. That said I like every song on this album. Having only radio to get my BEP fix previously it was unbeknown to me that ""Let's get it Started"" is actually ""Lets get Retarded"". Now while some have found this to be offensive it makes the logic of the song alot easier to understand. If you actually listen to what the lyrics are saying it is not offensive at all and is a really creative use of verbage that we are so rarely treated to in popular music.A must have for the BEP fan and for someone who is looking for something smarter than the usual canned gangsta rap."
1,Something's gone horribly wrong,"I really like the BEPs and loved their first two albums. I caught them live once and really liked their different sound -- especially the inclusion of horns. And I've been eagerly awaiting this album.That said, this album was painful to listen to. To me it sounds like typical generic hip hop, with lyrics about women and women's bodies and other unoriginal ideas. No clever rhymes, and ""Let's Get Retarded"" is simply one of the most offensive titles I've ever heard.Poor judgment in including a new fourth member can be forgiven, but pandering to the lowest common denominator in order to fit in cannot. I am no longer a fan."
3,Elephunk,"Though this album is pretty good, it get's a 3/5 from me. The reason i gave it a low score is becasue (and I think most people agree) the radio stations play Let's get Retarded/Started and Hey Mama waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to much (well, they used to, that is)."
2,High School Again,This CD was alot of fun but i wouldn't say its very good. This cd has a target audience in mind and its not post high school.
2,PARENTAL ADVISORY-EXPLICIT CONTENT,"I was cross when I bought this album. I thought it would be good, but it really isn't. A PARENTAL ADVISORY is issued to this album, but was never labeled with it. It contains strong lanuguage and simple sexual content. Please parents, DON'T buy this for your children. The only good songs are: Lets get It Started, Lets Get Retarded, Where Is The Love, & The Boogie That Be."
2,"Fake, cliched, trite, insincere, pretentious -- just bad....","This album is real, real bad... the summer hit ""Where is the Love"" especially. It sounds like a bunch of cliche catch phrases that were collected and rapped out onto the track. It sounds completely insincere and ridiculous to me. I actually can't help laughing everytime I hear it when I'm driving... ""People killing, people dying, children hurt, can you hear them crying, can you practice what you preach, and turn the other cheek"" -- I need to stop before I start cracking up again..."
2,i dont know what 2 give it,Lets Get Retarted is AWESOMELets Get It Started is a STUPID clean version (lets get it started-last song on the cd doesnt work either)Where Is The Love is OLD nowHey Mama is good but some EXTREMELY wierd lyricsHands Up has a nice beatShut Up is goodBest- Lets get Retated and Shut Up
2,erm.....no,"I'm sorry, but this CD is not really what i'd call...music that i'd want to listen to. ""hey mama"" wasn't bad, but i couldn't see any of the other tracks becoming hits. It's pretty anoying to listen to, it bugs me, lol. DON'T BUY IT!!! I'm warning you."
1,A car Accident of melodic proportions....,"This has to be the single-most horrible accident on the face of the earth. The worst part of this ""band"" of ""musicians"" gaining success has to be the people actually buying the CD. What are you thinking? Yes you! Terrible! I wouldn't torture Iraqi soldiers with this ""music"". 1 out of 5, only because there's no decimal points."
2,Slightly Decieved,"I bought this CD off of amazon.com. I bought it just for the ""hey mama"" song. When i heard it on the radio it was one cool jam and I really got into it, but when I finally got the CD I put it right on that song and it is a totally different version. it is ok, but the new version is much better. just to let you know if you are buying this CD for that song you may want to hear it first to see if you like it. i had to learn the hard way!"
5,Black Eyed Peas Bring The Funk!,"This is the best album I have heard this year. I have looked over other reviews, and I don't think that these people giving the album 1 star know what they are talking about. ""Where Is The Love"" is an amazing track, however is not the only bright spot on the album. Elephunk has many songs that could be hits, such as ""Hands Up"", ""Shut Up"", ""Labor Day(It's A Holiday)"", ""Latin Girls"", ""Fly Away"", and ""Anxiety"". They explore so many kinds of music on this album. That's what makes Elephunk such a great CD. The addition of Fergie adds a whole new part to their music that we haven't heard before. If it is true that this is going to be their last album, I think they should definitely rethink that. I think Black Eyed Peas could have a whole lot of good music to come."
3,Ok CD,"Ok,when I first heard them,I didn't like them. But now I do. The only songs I like is Let's Get It Started,Where is the love?,Shut up,and Labor day(its a holiday) is ok. If you like hip-hop and rap,I bet you will like Elephunk"
1,very poorly made cd,"the quality of the beats in very few of the songs are good. the group makes numerous attempts at trying to be hiphop with the woo woo woo stuff everynow and then. this is THE worst audio cd i have ever heard in my entire life; i listened to less than half of the cd and couldnt stand it anymore after the ""retarded"" song. yeah and i dont care if they are talking about getting high, all of these songs are bad, period. never buy this cd unless you want to regret it for the rest of your life until you perish."
1,...,"This album can be described in two simple, clear words: PURE GARBAGE. After listening to Behind The Front, I couldn't stop and it kept getting better with Bridging The Gap (especially with the awesome lineup of guests!). Then came in Elephunk. I was so excited to listen to it after I listened to Let's Get Retarded. Guess what happened? I wanted to punch Will.I.Am in the face for making such a WACK album. I swear, they have no edge anymore, no Premier, no nothing. Except the stupid errand boy, Justin Timberlake. Do me, hip-hop...heck even Kool DJ Herc or KRS-One a favor and boycott this album!"
3,elephunk,i was wondering if anyone could tell me what is that song the black eyed peas do on that best buy commercial the one where it says you can control the peas with one button if anyone knows let me know thanks
2,Blugh....,"Oh where have you strayed, BEP? This is an utter sell-out. Really, really corny lyrics throughout, made only worse by the excessive and unoriginal brand of funk they try to jam down your throat on every track. This album is reserved for the suburban kids who live and die by the TRL top ten and would never dabble into real hip hop. Blugh..."
4,De La Soul References?,Anyone else out there notice that a lot of the songs borrow from De La's Buhloone Mind State?
4,So-So Album,This album could have been a little better than it was but i cant complain about it cuz there were a few good songs on that cd (lets get it started lets get retarted where is the love) but was it really necisarry to swear in almost all of the songs? this cd is really a PARENTAL ADVISORY cd but it doesnt say it!I heard about that one from the TARGET website from some other dude. Anyway...it could have been better without the swearing. Also i cant listen 2 it on my stereo cuz my parents think there is 2 much swearing in it...it sucks!
3,Could have been way better,"I know this album could have been iller than this, I mean, its the Black Eyed Peas! Some songs were undoubtedly good, but theres something missing about the songs. Weird..I dont what it is though.I don't really like it, but if you do buy it you won't hate it either."
4,for something similar,"A not so familiar band with a similar sound to the Black Eyed Peas is ""ASIN #B00004T48E""SPOOKS . Not listening really for the message or lyrics though some I've heard alot on the radio. I like the sound."
4,bop your head like epilepsy,"Although this is a hip-hop/rap band, there is quite a variety of styles here. I really like them when they get into the non-rap stuff such as funk, Latin and even some metal. Plus they have a Funkedelic sense of humor, such as in the funky song ""Let's Get Retarded"" with fun stupid lyrics like ""bop your head like epilepsy"". Great album for its genre."
3,"less ""phunk"" than i was hoping for...","this cd seemed promising because of the excellent ""where is the love"". however, i was very dissapointed with many of the songs. they were very similar and unmemorable.1 - Hands Up 10/10 not a bad start2 - Labor Day 10/10 good song3 - Let's Get Retarded 10/10 the old version which i like better4 - Hey Mama 10/10 great fast song with a good video5 - Shut Up 10/10 amazing verses and also a great chorus6 - Smells Like Funk 10/10 very weird7 - Latin Girls 5/10 boring8 - Sexy 5/10 boring...again9 - Fly Away 5/10...and again10- The Boogie That Be 5/10...and AGAIN11- The APL Song 5/10...this is getting out of hand12- Anxiety 5/10...at this point you really lose all hope13- Where Is The Love 10/10 Finally! A good one!14- Let's Get It Started 10/10 very goodso yea. 8/14 songs are good. but then for 6 straight songs, they are all the same with little energy.3/5 stars...just ok"
1,At least they are honest....,"The Black Eyed Peas expressed a desire to get retarded. And then they did just that. Where is the love, indeed?"
4,why is the only good rap in existence being bashed!?,"I thought rap was a completely hopeless genre capable of no appeal to me until the Black-Eyed Peas came out with this CD, full of awesome songs like Hey Mama, Hands Up, Let's Get Started, Where Is The Love, Shut Up etc. Then of course there are the Beastie Boys which I like also, but other than that I hate all rap. I find it hilarious that there are people out there who would believe that 50 Cent has talent. Blasting out expletives right and left on top of a beat you could make with a Casio doesn't hardly count as music if you ask me. Anyway, I find this CD very refreshing, and it is an important headstone in the continuous timeline of music. If you want good rap, look no further than this CD by the B-E Peas and their latest: Monkey Business, both are quite good. Also the Beastie Boys are even better, so check them out. Otherwise rap is an awful genre. THis might even be counted as hiphop too, so rap is made even worse by that fact.The end."
2,Ele-junk,"""Where Is The Love"" is a great song. ""Let's Get It Started"" is agreeable radio candy but it doesn't hold up to repeated listenings. You get tired of it pretty fast. It's mostly downhill from there. I like albums to have a fair bit of stylistic and tempo variation to keep me interested. I know this stuff is supposed to be cutting edge but it just gives me a headcahe. BEPs should have waited until they had better material. This album may have sold well but I'm betting their next one will tank. People who bought this won't be going back to the well."
1,Where's the love? Where's the BEP's?,"...I am a big BEP fan, but i feel kind of cheated with this ablum because all i got was some chick singing the hooks, takin center stage! Man this album [is bad]! They need to let the girl go, and return to the old BEP's. Don't get me wrong Fergie I think her name is has a good voice and would be great on her own but she just seemed to mess up the chemistry of the Peas. Overall with the exception of the single which in most cases probably should be a second or third single the album is really boring. This was 2 1/2 years of work? Come on Will you can do better than that!!"
2,Wats with them,yeah they belch out peacebut does it look like it is really happeningthere songs are soulful and there ownthey have there own originalitybut they do remind me sort of some other singername i can't get to come to mindlolcd is okayi recommend buying another cd like:1. chingy2. ludacris3. outkast4. usher5. Eamon
1,Bad,"I did not like the song ""Let's Get Retarded"" it is degrading for the retarded.I do not think this item is good for kids."
1,Too eclectic for me.,only found 1 song I liked on the entire CD thanks to Whitney and it sounded better coming from her.
5,The best up-beat CD EVER!,"I was a little skeptical at first, but my friend told me it was great, and she was right! Every song is immediately catchy and the lyrics are great! If you like music, you should buy this CD!!! I'm not a big fan of rap or funk but I love this album! BUY IT!!!"
4,Elephunk,Outstanding CD. Most CD's have only a couple of very strong songs and a number of medicore. Elephunk has only a couple of songs that aren't outstanding.
5,The beps rock the house!!!!,"My friend has this CD, and it is like...I cant explain how good this is. All the songs are great and me and my friend LOVE lets get it started (and retarded) we have a little dance to it. lol. Its great and dont listen to the bad reviews!!!!"
4,Good Investment,"The Black Eyed Peas are a great group. While City High tried to imitate the Fugees and failed, this group has broken the mold and are just making music...not trying to imitate anybody. Most of the songs on this album are catchy. (ie Let's Get Retarded, Hey Mama, Where Is The Love). The songs you have not heard on the radio are good songs. This CD is really funky (hence the title), and was also a good investment. I recommend this CD to those that like good music. Fergie's vocals complement the songs realyl well."
1,BEP went HIP POP,If you were a fan of BEP's first album save yourself the disapontment of buying elephunk it's wack. They going from being one of the most creative underground groups in Hip Hop to doing songs with Justin Timberlake and Papa Roach??? If you want to buy a good new Hip Hop album by Gangstarr's new album The Ownerz or Krs-One Kristyles. Your money will be better spent. From one hip hop fan to another.
3,opinions from non-hip hop fan,"This is my first hip hop album thanks to extensive broadcasting of ""where is the love"", which is an easily acceptable tune for non hip hop listeners. If you've not experienced any hip hop record before, you may take this as a touchstone and I'm sure you will be gratified by most of the songs.You may want to move your feet unconsciously in the first 15 minutes cause the album starts with consecutively heavy rhythms from track 1 to 4. Then here comes the ""shut up"" which starts another wacky-funky 10 minutes ends with ""smells like funk."" Track 7 ""latin girls"" and track 8 ""sexy"" may be the most graceful period for those who bought this album for ""where is the love."" Track 9 ~ 12 got it's own characteristics but not catchy too far, or I'll rate it four stars, then there's ""where is the love"" and one hilarious bonus track.Well enough for my first trip on hip hop! Three stars is just the beginning."
3,BEP Steps Into The Mainstream,"I appreciate that artists want to appeal to a larger audience, but, what is missing from this CD that were present on BEP's first two, is an edge. This unfortunately, is partly due to the newest member, Fergie. While she has a wonderful voice, her addition was an obvious attempt to appeal to a more mainstream audience. And it worked perfectly. The CD as a whole is not bad at all, in fact, some songs are great. But, overall, I expect more from a group of this caliber, and it bothers me that they have ventured out into this new direction.On the up side, the message remains positive and upbeat, and the production is very slick."
2,Watered down.....,"Bought this CD after buying ""21 and over"". Will I. Am is the man. When you can write a dope track for Dexter's Laboratory you can do anything. I was heavily dissappointed. Whole CD was very pop-like. Their originality has given way to mainstream. Trying to break a mold isn't always good, and adding a singer is always bad (Ja Rule, Ashanti). Fergie is cute, but not needed. My wife likes this Cd, but she also like J.LO. I give it 2 stars, down if i could. Get Will I Am's ""21 and over"". More like BEPs usual stuff."
3,it's a good album,"i didn't like where is the love but some of the tracks can really get you dancing and will probably stick in your mind for some time. i like hey mama, let's get it started and the apl song. they're not very lyrically talented in some of the songs but they have good beats and they can combine lots of musical styles. if you liked where is the love, then buy this album. but if you didn't like it much, then maybe you can buy a used one, you might still like some of the other tracks."
3,"Like a POP,but is HARD!!!!!!",1. Hands Up - 42. Labor Day (It's A Holiday) - 53. Let's Get Retarded - 4.54. Hey Mama - 4.55. Shut Up - 36. Smells Like Funk - 37. Latin Girls - 4.58. Sexy - 49. Fly Away - 3.510. The Boogie That Be - 411. The Elephunk Theme - 512. The apl Song - 3.513. Anxiety - 314. Where Is The Love? - 2.5Lyrics - 4/5Production - 3/5
5,Great Overall CD,This is a great CD! I just picked it up yesterday and listened to it.. I find that there isnt really a song on the cd that I dislike!
4,The Gr8 Taste of Peas,"The Black Eyed Peas debut cd,""Elephunk"" is truly a piece of work. It has a great hip-hop and rap flavor. Their songs don't sound alike, but they all have the same bounce in it. The Black Eyed Peas have done an excellent job with their first album. If you liked Sean Paul, you'll like the Black Eyed Peas, and vice versa. Enjoy the taste of the Black Eyed Peas!!"
1,Shut up Shut up!!!,"AAAArGGGGGhHHHHH!!!! I hate this song if i hear one more person singing it im gonna go mental. Furgi, love, you cant sing live to save your life so dont try. Keep your mediocre voice in the recording studio where they can jazz it up by computer. Oh yeah and that song lets get retarded? too late you allready are. That song is retarded, speaking of witch its not a word that should be used lightly. Plus the whole song stinks. Oh yeah you really thought hard about the lyrics didnt you. Lets get retarded ha, lets get retarded in here, lets get retarded ha, lets get retarded in here, woo hoo ha woo hoo in here woo hoo ha woo hoo in here. Wow you really had a brainstorm, oh woops i cant say that because it can refer to epileptic children and it would be thoughtless of me. Well, no more then your cd is. The black eyed peas should go back in their pods and sent into the sun."
3,I like music,I think hip hop is good. This cd is good. Black Eyed Peas are good. Their other albums are gooder.
2,This is crap,I dont like this anymore. It's just too non gangsta rap. I like gangsta rap but the only non gangstas I like are Outkast and Goldie Lookin Chain and Dizzee Rascal and The Streets are good. They are rap wannabes The Black Eyed Peas are! They should be ashamed. This was also the 1st rap album I bought and now since September when I had proper rap like D12 I've not listened to it once. buy if u r a wannabe rap listener but if u want rap these r reccomendedJay Z The Black AlbumAny by EminemAny by Snoop DoggDr Dre 2001The Game The Documentary50 Cent The MassacreGoldie Lookin Chain Greatest Hits and Straight Outta NewportSo this sucks dont buy and that Fergie makes them worse and like if u were 'rappers' you would'nt feature Papa roach and Justin Timberlake on your songs you would have Dr Dre and all them. too political and foul mouths? I hardly hear them swear except the odd s**t. Peace dont buy this wannabe crap!R.J from Britain
1,SO BAD,"This is perhaps the worst rap group ever. The song ""Where is the Love"" is the worst song/video i have ever heard/seen in my life. I think its completly disgraceful and disrespectful about how they refer to the CIA as terrorists. They have obviously no IQ what so ever. Im also not down with the whole guy singing like a girl thing(Justin Timberlake). Anyone who breaks up with Britney Spears has no IQ either. You know your career is over when your singing duets with The Black Eyed Pee's. Elephunk is also the worst name for an Album. I would never waste my money on an album called Elephunk...even if it was the name of 50 cents album. THE CIA IN NO WAY ARE TERRORISTS. THESE GUYS ALONG WITH JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE SHOULD BE DEPORTED"
4,great album,"this is a good bep album. i like the fergie addition.the only song on the album i don't like is 'latin girls'luckily i dont need to worry about it, but parents should know that this is not a clean radio edit album."
3,it's okay,"I heard the Hey Mama song on the radio and decided to buy this CD and listen to the song non stop because I liked it and the radio didn't play it enough. But I was disappointed. The extra tracks version has a sort of watered down version of the song that's not as good as the original version. Also, a lot of the songs on here are too uneventful and inconsistent. To add even more disappointment, the bonus track was just a barely changed version of Let's Get Retarded (they only changed the let's get retarded part to let's get it started) and that's it. The other songs are pretty good, especially Anxiety with Papa Roach. Hands Up is good too but the rest of the songs are kinda annoying. I wish I would've gotten the original version but this is fine for now."
3,Average,"An odd mix of styles, from pop to hip hop thru bhangra.Many of the tracks are predictable fillers, but ""the apl song"", ""smells like funk"" and ""shut up"" make it worth giving a spin."
1,hypoCRIT!,""" i wanna smak somebody"""" where is the love ""shut up, get your mind strait, and you wont have these bloody images"
2,Let's get retarded-- yeah,"The only reason why i give this Cd any stars is because of the appeal they get with having ""club-friendly"" fun beats. But I must say that songs with titles like ""shut up"" and the disgusting ""let's get retarded"" refrain from being tactful. In fact, i think the latter should have been banned for the use of the word retarded with such vulgarity."
1,What an outrageous group.,"What an outrageous group, how can anyone like this rubbish. Maybe an horde of brainless people. How I feel happy in being intelligent, and live my life with things of absolute quality and not consuming this kind of food for mediocres. How said Romans, ""it's just bread and circus to the poors"". Give to people what they deserve, rubbish! It's because you mediocre people that buy this, that this kind of people, the members of this group, get money and laughs behind the scenes about how dumb people can be. It's the same horde that buy, Beyonce, Spears, Madona, and other outrageous poor music."
1,Dispicable,"""Let's get Retarded?"" oh that's so funny and clever and witty! This band is comparible to Crash Test Dummies and the great Spin Doctors! Let's make fun of the mentally challenged and appeal to the lowest common denominator!!! Hey, your next cd should be called ""Let's get crippled and ride in a wheelchair"" or ""Let's have a stroke and slur our speech""; oh yes, with talent like that, the black peas will be around for a long time!"
4,woah slow down,"man is that first guy an idiot - and YES 'lets get retarded' IS obviously justified as offensive to disabled people! But obviously you keep an open mind about these things, as you seem to suffer from sort of mental disadvantage, and manage not to take ofense to the track name aswell!Albums pretty funky fresh too :p"
1,Poison for my ears!,"If you have a bit of intelligence please don't buy this album, it sucks!! The only good songs you can find in it are Where Is The Love, Shut Up (which I love)and Hey Mama (but better the single version). I don't like Let's Get Retarded (become Let's Get It Started coz the other was quite offensive and the sound wasn't that good)so I dunno why they chose it as single..maybe coz they couldn't find something better in the record!! The rest is pure crap, rubbish to throw away in an half a second. I hope I'm saving you from totally wasting money."
4,PAPA ROACH DOES NOT SING HERE!!!!,Does everyone think Papa Roach sings on Anxiety? It is Pillar. Does anyone not know this? Give credit where credit is due. Papa Roach is a good band. But they did not sing on that song!
2,An Alright Album,"I got this cd while I was just looking around the store.When I saw that ""Shut Up"",my favorite new song on the radio was on it.I knew I wanted it.After getting to my car I put it in and was in love with ""Shut Up"",after it I started back at track 1 and worked down the line to see if any of the songs stood out and few did.Of the few were,""Hey Mama"", ""Hands Up"", and ""Smells Like Funk"".But aside from these tracks I never have liked any.I'm not saying not to buy this album, I'm saying listen to samples from the net, or borrow a friend's copy, just try it before you buy it.I am still happy with getting this,just so I could have ""Shut Up""By the way, ""Hey Mama"" is in a t.v. ad for iPod.""Shut Up"" is in an ad for XM Radio."
5,I Just Want To Make A Point!!,"Okay, y'all are soo worried about ""Lets Get Retarded"" and the disrespect its bringing. Okay my point is ...1. They did not make fun of retarded people in anyway, the used the meaning of ""retarded"" as dancing crazy.2. At the beginning of the song they said ""In this context, there's no disrespect"" NO DISRESPECT y'all!!!! They didn't mean it like that.3. Yeah, they shouldn't of used the words ""retarded"" maybe using ""lets get stupid"" would've been a better choice.4. Still this album has great beats."
4,DVD,This is one of my favorites from the Peas. CD came on time and in great shape as described. Really great price too!! Thanks
5,a classic in its genre,A classic! I only have a few CDs in my collection since going to the iPod and this is one CD I still enjoy listening to while driving.
5,Pittsburgh Steelers # 1,"Outstanding video of the history of the Steelers. Well done and brings back alot of memories of the glory days of the 1970's. Recommend this DVD for all football fans, you don't have to love the Steelers to enjoy it."
5,COOL,"AWESOME DVD!!!!!!! INTERESTING INFO ON THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS, WHO IS MY FAVORITE NFL FOOTBALL TEAM. GO STEELERS BUY THIS DVD TODAY, STEELERS FANS"
5,Steelers,"My niece will enjoy anything about the Steelers,but this is a worthy video for all sports fans.We rate this at the top of our sports DVD's"
5,A must for Stillers fans,"If you are a native of ""The 'Burgh"" and a ""Stillers"" fan, you must have this DVD set. The complete history of the team, plus profiles of great players and full coverage of Super Bowl XIII make this a great value."
4,good deal for Steelers fans,"this is a great set and very nice price. my only complaint would be some of the footage I already saw on NFL Network, and would have preferred some new stuff. I reccomend this one!"
2,Lousy reset mechanism,"As usual, the Amazon free UPS ground shipping came superfast ! Product assembly details are bad. You end up looking at the picture on the box and assembling by trial and error. The only well built part was the target itself. Super thick, excellent grade steel. The reset mechanism was lousy, didnt look like it would work for more than a few visits to the range. The height is super short and the base is not heavy enough to stand on itself on hard range surfaces. Unfortunately the range I go to is not soft enough to drive the stakes in. Had to return the item unused to Amazon and hoping I can get a refund. Disappointing outing to the Range ! !"
2,Just okay.,The target does what it's supposed to with resetting but the stickers they give you to put on for the targets are just a waste of time because they flew off right after the first shot.
1,open box poorly delivered,Box arrived openOne of the pressure pins was missingalthough a replacement part was included the shipper did not bother to put the part togetherNice product but would not buy from this vendor!
1,Theres better ones out there,"At 25 and 50 years the 3 tagets are being battered so badly they will soon shatter, even after light usage. Also, you have to shoot down towards to ground all the time, reccommend purchasing one that is higher."
2,Waste of money,ITs only 45 minutes. And with that only minutes of 3d recording. Its more like a demo blurayI hope the make a correct 3d titanic bluray with hours of recording. This i just a waste of my money
4,Cute!,"I originally bought this thinking it was a full size sleeping bag for a child, apparently I didn't read very closely. When it came in the envelope I was slightly shocked, but my neice loved it for her barbies anyway! It is very cute!"
1,NOT a sleeping bag,"Desperately needing to find a child's sleeping bag for a birthday party only days away, and discovering that no brick and mortar stores in my area carry them at this time of year, I went to trusty Amazon. Little did I know that when you search on ""Sleeping Bag,"" toys would be displayed along with actual sleeping bags. This item is a toy. Silly me for not reading the description and just looking at the picture. I suppose when I buy books in the future I should also verify that it actually is a book and I'm not ordering a picture of a book to hang on my wall, because that would do me about as much good as a toy sleeping bag when I need an actual sleeping bag for a five-year-old tomorrow.The toy itself is actually cute and well-made. A wonderful friend at work has removed the reminder of my complete and abject failure from my sight."
1,Not what you think it is,"This is a sleeping bag for a doll,yet it lists under children's sleeping bags.Wasn't I suprised when the box arrived."
5,Love Love Love,Love the groovy girls sleeping bag. Fits the groovy girls perfectly -- easy for little hands to insert dolls. My 5 year old loves it!
5,Good!,"This is the second grandchild I've bought this for. The first reads it to me in English and I read to her in French - trying to reverse the process - she's capable, just stubborn. Great book in any language!"
2,Mine are peeling too,"I bought them in Canada and they were quite expensive. I'm very careful with them, but my lovely violet one is peeling after not that many uses. I keep them on a soft cloth where nothing can rub the edges. I'm so sorry I spent the money on these."
1,I want my money back,"paid $50 US, for these peeling little things. negative 5 stars. the martini glasses did the same thing."
2,"Not that good, but at least she had an excuse here","From 1984, this album by Janet Jackson is completely different from what most Janet fans expect of her. There are no standout cuts on this album, and overall, the whole thing is pretty flat. However, the thing that makes most people diss her latterday albums is simply the fact that being in the spotlight for so long has gone to her head. In the case of this album, the only reason why they don't equal the greatness of classics like Control, Rhythm Nation or Janet is because she was pretty young and hadn't yet developed her signature style. More importantly, she hadn't yet become acquainted with Jimmy Jam Harris and Terry Lewis, who are most responsible for developing the signature sound of the above mentioned albums.The point basically is that it's better to be unpolished than to polish yourself and then refuse to bow out after the polish wears off."
3,"Fun album; too candy, sweet and cheesy like","Dream Street was a fun album by Janet Jackson back in 1984. But was this album produced by some 16-year olds in a high school? Songs like Dream Street, Hold Back The Tears, the silly Fast Girls and Communciation sound so candy sweet and formulaic in their 3-minute confections. But Janet is better on funky songs like Don't Stand Another Chance and Pretty Boy (where Jesse Johnson is so funky on the guitars on there!). If it Takes All Night is quite good and the duet Two to the Power of Love is nice. But you can tell that Janet was a teen back then and the album fit with her style. Vocally, she wasn't there yet, a little too squeaky on a few songs. It just took later albums like Control, Rhythm Nation, Janet, Velvet Rope, All For You and Damita Jo to make her a huge superstar in the process. This is for interested people only, because the album's sweetness is all too obvious."
4,Slightly Better Than Her First,"Many have made the mistake of claiming Janet's first album was 1986's CONTROL. CONTROL was her breakthrough album. Sadly her 1st album JANET JACKSON (1982) and DREAM STREET (1984) are often forgotten. They aren't perfect, but neither are any of her albums. Every album has its flaw which is what makes her a compelling artist. DREAM STREET was produced by various producers the Jackson brothers hired for the project, including Giorgio Moroder who also produced Donna Summer back in the day. In fact the production is pretty good on this album. The album has its strong tracks (Dream Street, Don't Stand Another Chance, Hold Back The Tears, Fast Girls), but also has some really bad songs (Two To The Power of Love with Cliff Richard, what was she thinking?). This album might not be for everyone but check it out if you want to hear what happened before CONTROL, at this price it might just be for the hardcore fan."
3,I'll Tell You One Thing. . .,"""Dream Street"" sounds MUCH BETTER than that new ""20 Y.O."" CD she has out now. I can hear the sincerity in her voice and, most importantly, there is no Jermaine Dupree. Three stars, but I wouldn't pay $36 for it. That would be crazy."
2,not so good at all,"I would rate this Janet's weakest album, her first was kinda cute and had more of a glance and style than this one... it sounds really flat all over, and to me has nothing funky at all, just eeky electrosounds from the eighties, whereas the eighties have produced some really awesome funky music, check out Change, Chic, SOS Band, Loose Ends, Luther, Alexander O'Neal, Cherelle, etc.This album gives me the chills and not in a good way, thank god Janet decided to work with Jam & Lewis after this mistake."
5,an underrated gem!,"This album could have been her own ""Ooops..I Did It Again"" had she been marketed right. It has that typical 80s sound, but it's pure delight just hearing her sweet, innocent, girly voice. Puts a smile on my face each day. I really don't understand why this album wasn't a success. It had potential...no matter how cheesy the lyrics were. It's pure, unadulterated, fun pop bliss. She could have been a successful teen star like Britney, Donny Osmond, and all those other bubblegum pop stars.BEST ONES!1) Don't Stand Another Chance- the track that sounds out the most. it makes you want to dance.2) Pretty Boy- i really like this song. i just love 80s music.3) Fast Girls- another song you can dance to4) If It Takes All Night5) Hold Back the Tears- it sounds like it would be on the Fame soundtrack.Honorable mention: Two To The Power Of Love"
3,not bad,"this is much better than her debut album, though it's nowhere near what the janet albums from control through velvet rope are. This music on this album is a period piece, and it contains production from her brother marlon jackson, the producers of Fame and a protege of Prince. The best songs on this album are Dream Street, Hold Back the Tears and All My Love To You(definitely michael jackson sounding). So if you're interested in janet's early work before she became successful, purchase this."
4,A Great Album That Reflects The 80's Sound,"One of Miss Jan's best albums, spawning excellant hits like ""Two To The Power"", ""Fast Girls"", and ""Don't Stand Another Chance"", plus a great megamix of ""Pretty Boy"" and ""Fast Girls"", ""French Blue"", (not on the album). My favorite song is ""If It Takes All Night"". The 80's sound is most obvious on tracks like ""Communication"", but is still strong throughout the entire album. Definately a great buy for anyone."
4,good stuff!,"From 1984 this is a winner of a release by Jackson. Reason - production is excellent on the key tracks - ""don't stand another..."", ""all my love to you"" produced by Marlon Jackson which have the early 80's Jacksons sound all over them w/Janet still standing out (quite a feat). ""Dream street"", ""hold back the tears"", and duet w/Cliff Richard (of ""Suddenly"" w/Olivia-Newton-John, 'we don't talk anymore"",etc.fame) on ""2 two the power of love"", produced by the team of Pete Bellote/Giorgio Moroder (Donna Summer), are all top-notch and worth price of import if you are intrigued enough to cough up the cash. The duet is really excellent (actually they blend in a way similar to the way he did w/ONJ). A couple of weaker tracks but still a nice job done here!"
1,The Worst Album By Miss Janet,"This album, it's only for Janet's fans, because it really doesn't fullfil Janet's talents. The songs sounds like Donna Summer's dropouts, or typical sounds of the 80's that don't apport nothin' new, although if you're a Janet fan buy it, so you can see this leading lady at her worst."
3,"Cute, but not my daughter's favorite","I bought this for my 13 month old, who is in the phase of ""putting things in and taking things out."" I don't know what it is about this that she doesn't love, but I can say it doesn't entertain her for long. I've tried doing the whole Three Little Pigs story as we play with it but she's just not that interested. It is a well made toy, I think she's just not that in to it!"
5,Grandson loved it,Our 3 yr old grandson loves the 3 little pigs. Wants our daughter to read the story to him several times a day. We got this for his birthday a few weeks ago and he just loves it. I was afraid it would be a little young for him but he really loves playing with it. It appears well made and looks like it will hold up well through his hours of playing with it.
4,Almost 2yo loves it,"A present from Santa ... Daughter loves it. Even the older kids want to tell the story with it (plus we re-told billy goats gruff with pigs and wolf). Bit frustrating smaller houses don't stand up so well but we will survive. Good quality, nice size. Plastic animals sturdy."
5,so much fun for 15 month old & three year old,"both of my children LOVE this toy! my 15 month-old daughter loves it & picks it to take everywhere. my 3 year-old son loves it too & likes to show my daughter how it works. we also use it as a puppet show (eventhough the characters are not puppets, they still work great behind our theatre) really nice toy that encourages independent play but can also be used for a variety of educational/interactive activities. just got on here to order one as a gift :)"
5,The Three Little Reasons,"This is such a great toy that is portable, cute, and fun to play with. It tells the timeless story and allows a child to play different games...hide 'n seek, counting, and sound-making. It's softness is safe and each piece is easy to carry. I bought the book to go along."
4,Adorable Toy,"This is an extremely cute toy. The little pigs, all color coordinated with their respective houses and numbers on their chests from smallest to biggest, are adorable. The pigs squeak when squeezed, the only thing that my son seems to like about this toy. Now, I refuse to hold that against this set. Possibly my son is too young for this toy, having received it for his first Christmas? Maybe he just simply doesn't like it? However, I can see where it could be a very engaging little toy. Though I haven't tried washing the houses yet, I love the fact that they can go in the washing machine. Having 5 dogs and all the dog hair that goes along with them, having a toy that can be thrown in the washing machine is a dream. My complaint with the toy? One of the little pigs came with the paint chipped off a part of his belly which is only getting worse with time, even though my son really doesn't play with them. Aside from that, the set seems quite durable."
2,babies are not interested in it,"I bought it for my 21month twins. Unfortunately, they are not interested in it at all. It's just sitting there now."
5,One of the best toys I've ever purchased,"I have 39 month old twins and they are obsessed with this toy, especially my son. They love the story of the three little pigs, and they act it out with this toy constantly. It's very well made and interesting because the three houses nest one inside the other. There's room to push in all three pigs plus the wolf into the houses as well. The pigs and wolf also double as interesting bath toys. I am so happy with this that I'll be purchasing it as gifts (along with a book about the three little pigs) for lots of their little friends this year. By the way, the wolf does not look scary."
5,How cute is this...!!,"Christmas present for my grandson. He is almost 11 months old and I have just discovered ""Melissa & Doug"", they make the best toys."
5,"Too much detail, not enough drama? Try these lessons","This is a wonderful watercolor book, and I must have dozens in my library. Malcolm Beattie gets right to the point and shows you how to emphasize the main points in watercolor painting, and how to add punch and drama to each work.I especially liked his instruction on how to do figures, whether simple and undetailed, or with action in their movement, to add life to the painting. If you like doing landscapes or cityscapes, this book is for you. I really got some useful tips, and of course Beattie's paintings are worth looking at just for enjoyment alone. Great resource."
3,Nice bag except for the handle,"I've owned this bag for about a year.I don't carry it everyday. Perhaps twice a week i would carry it with my Dell 15.4"" laptop with its power supply, mouse, 24-cd case, and other small items.The bag is good enough size for my purpose and i like it alot.The only thing i don't like about it is that the handle on the top is beginning to fall off. So, i carry it by the back-strap(s).the junk it compartment is rarely used, though it can be very useful to some.I have to give it a 3-star because of its workmanship on the handle. (i'm afraid when the back-strap might go as well)Other than that, it's a good bag (especially the fact that it doesn't scream, 'I have a laptop within me!')"
3,Unimpressed,Serves the purpose but did not meet my criteria for a laptop case that is functional and looks good. Look cheap but what do you expect for $35!!!
4,Pretty Good Redesign,"I have had the previous version of the Kensington saddlebag for several years and it has served me well - until I have abused it beyond repair. I have a company-issued Lenovo R60, with an extended battery, which is HUGE and heavy.This new design is pretty good. I was worried that it might be a little smaller than its predecessor, to my (pleasant) surprise, it's expandable! I like the little junk drawer on the bottom, but I wish they would have kept the big pocket that was on the front of the old one. It was handy.Also considering the main issue with my old bag was the backpack straps coming apart, I'm a bit worried about the straps on this one. They're attached differently.All in all - not bad!"
2,yikes,"the thing is huge and pretty darn ugly. shame on dell for not giving an adequate picture of what this thing looks like. looks like a solid case, but not for me. i hope they give me a refund..."
2,HUGE,"This bag arrived in a huge box big enough to hold a VCR, the bag has a lot of storage areas and is versatile but I had to return it because it is simply too big and too ugly. Unless you are built like a football player this bag will cover your entire back."
4,"Lush cinematography, with an all-star cast","This is a ""deluxe"" production of an Agatha Christie tale, with a cast employing well-known actors in every role. Filmed on location, the cinematography is compelling beautiful. We are treated to scenes of the Pyramids and the Sphinx.As in all of Christie's stories, her twist-filled plot quickly absorbs the viewer.I do have to admit, this movie seems a little padded and overblown compared to the excellent, more concise BBC presentations of Christie's mysteries. Especially near the end, things seem to be drawn-out, overly long; the pace seems to lag.Nevertheless, the web of mystery is spun well, and if you are unfamiliar with the tale, you will be surprised at the denoument. Recommended for all ages."
2,Why No Captions?!,"This is one of my favorite Agatha Christy stories, and Peter Ustinov is the consummate actor to portray Poirot. This show is very well done, and it leaves you guessing until the last moment. My biggest disappointment was when I discovered that it had no captions or subtitles. When will the dvd makers realize that this is a very important tool when viewing a dvd?! The cast of stars in this show is impressive, and all do a great job in bringing the story to life. It's well acted, and the cinematography is spectacular. A great show, but since it is a murder mystery, small kids might be shook up with the violence that unfolds. Well worth watching, even without captions."
5,Death on the Nile,"I LOVE this movie!! I would highly recommend it to anyone! It has beautiful scenery, is well acted, with a wonderful plot!"
4,It keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!,"A great movie; full of suspense. Good acting and great plot. Read the book, too!!!"
3,USTINOV INHABITS POIROT,"Perhaps the fictional characterization that dominates most people's memories of Ustinov is his take on Agatha Christie's Inspector Poirot.The debut and best of his several incarnations of the fussy Belgian sleuth is here in the star-studded DEATH ON THE NILE. Can he identify the killer of a newlywed found murdered during a cruise of elegant vacationers before the ship of clues docks?When Rosalind Hicks, author Christie's daughter fist saw actor Ustinov, she said, ""That's not Poirot."" Ustinov replied, ""It is now, my dear."" From MGM/Anchor Bay. (1978, PG, Widescreen, 140 Minutes)"
3,Only for Christie fans,"When heiress Lynette Doyle (Lois Chiles) is murdered during a Nile cruise, it is up to super-sleuth Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) to seperate the culprit from the many suspects who had reason to want her dead. I have never been a fan of the ""cozy mystery"" sub-genre that was Agatha Christie's forte, in which suspects are bumped off at regular intervals until the detective gathers everyone in the drawing room to reveal his solution of the crime. Therefore, I am not the proper audience for this film. The cast is certainly impressive and the production is smooth. I enjoyed the beginning of the film quite a bit; it takes on the air of a smart, elegant comedy of manners as the foibles and interrelationships of the various characters are introduced. However, I began losing interest after the murder of the heiress, as the mystery aspects of the story asserted themselves, grinding formulaicly to an implausible conclusion./"
5,marialelia,"I received this DVD in good condition and have already watched it. The quality is good and no problems with receiving this product. I have ordered from Amazon before and have had no difficulties at all as yet. I hope to do business with you for many years as I have many items in my wish list! Thanks, marialelia"
2,They Should Have Gone Down With The Boat,"In spite of a distinguished cast and a script which remains faithful the author's famous novel, Death on the Nile is remarkably lackluster. Ustinov plays the celebrated Poriot largely for laughs, and the supporting players (a truly stellar cast, including Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury) largely follow suit; in consequence, the complicated and justly famous plot seems more a vehicle for its cast than the driving story it actually is. Easy on the eyes, fairly mindless, and certainly no Murder on the Orient Express."
1,don't order from this seller,"I order 3 movies from this seller; I had broken my leg and needed something to do; I also reordered from other sellers the same day and three days later...I received the others quickly...I received the others I order 3 days later..still no order from this seller finally on the last day 3wks later I received 2 of the movies I ordered but still a full month later .. I have not received the 3rd movie...don't be fooled I saw he had a lot of postive feedback, few neg.and cheap prices...but something has happened to this sellers business..I would never order from him again..."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this product. The basic idea is great, ie a diary for a special journey. But it leaves much to be desired. Firstly, the plastic cover is peeling off, and the back cover pocket has torn. As for the contents, this is little more than a notebook of mostly blank pages - which makes it very expensive, in my rating. Too many journeys (22!) in the opening Travel Schedule, and there could be a field to jot down the reservation code and the seat numbers. No provision for: packing list (including clothes to be taken), pre-journey checklist, tips for restuarants and hotels, including details of bookings, sights to be seen, addresses of shops, presents to be brought back, finances, useful telephone numbers (hotels, airports, stations, credit cards, tourist information centers, postcards to be sent and much much more."
3,Mixed Feelings,"In my opinion, these movies have terrific graphics and the varied ""directing"" approaches made the shows even more believable. However, while my husband and I enjoyed watching them through once, there are a couple things we both didn't like.It's a fact of life that critters in the animal kingdom can be brutal, but the creators seem to go out of their way to focus on bloody mess. Also, there appears to be a lot of science fiction being presented as scientific facts. Artistic interpretation can add much to the quality of a show, but we feel that creative speculation should be clearly presented as opinions/ideas. Likewise, it would be nice to hear the word ""theory"" used more often on these topics.We bought these shows primarily because our our young children (ages nine & under) like to learn about dinosaurs, and we want them to enjoy nature and science shows, but we're not comfortable letting them watch this series yet."
5,Wow..my kid just loves it!,"My son is fascinated by all things dinosaur and dragon. He loved this series. it was a great hit! I was a little worried that it might scare him since he's only 5 but although he got a little grossed out over some of the bloody scenes, he wasn't frightened at all. Very well done with narration and it was the best 3 hours of quiet time I had in awhile."
2,It was good for chased by dinosaurs not for walking with dinosaurs,I liked the chased by dinosaurs but then when i was watching walking with dinosaurs it starting cracking up!I cleaned it!!I payed $35 and got it new!!But it cracked up.
2,OK,I was a little bummed out by this. I bought it for my son who is 4 and loves dinosaurs. We watched some youtube videos of discovery channels walking with dinosaurs and this was not the same thing. He watched it. One of the discs is cool. the others were a lil boring for him.
2,Sex and violence,"I usually do not have a problem showing my kids documentaries about wild animals eating each other and mating, but I feel in this DVD series the authors took pleasure focusing on these aspects (like savoring stretchy guts and crunchy spines of the newly hatched young). A dinosaur lifting her tail to demonstrate that she was agreeable to mate was not appreciated either."
3,Teaches Evolution that's my only problem with it!,"I don't want my son to know about evolution, he's tooo young to understand that so WHY? If I wanted him to know about it I would teach it to him. The DvD is a collection so I just don't let him watch the one dvd it has on it.. I'm glad I watch all movies with my kids so I can see what they are watching.. Some people perhaps don't care for their kids to know about evolution, but I do. It's one of those things that just doesn't need to be on for a 4yr old to watch b/c I believe God made the heavens & the earth. I don't believe man came from a dumb ape! Evolution shouldn't be on a kids DVD b/c some people believe & some people don't.. So let us choose if we want them to learn that or not! I would have given it more stars if it didn't have evolution, My 4yr son loves this. Boys are soo into dinosaurs so what boy wouldn't love this collection!"
4,Good movie,The dino lover in my family loves the movies he is six and enjoys watching them over and over again.
5,Ultimate dinosaur series for kids!,My ten year old son LOVES dinosaurs and walks around with the Dinopedia book. This was s great set of film that are informative and realistic for older children that are dinosaur lovers.
5,I Love this Soundtrack,"I absolutely LOVE this soundtrack! In Jamaica, they did a dance to the music and I grew up loving the music even before I saw the movie. I now have the soundtrack on an LP which I bought in a second hand store but cannot listen to it because I do not have a record player. if anyone knows someone who has a CD of this music, PLEASE let me know I have been searching for years for a copy."
4,Witches Unite!,"I came across this little book while doing research on my ancestors. After learning I was a direct descendant of Daniel Westcott, I found his connection to late 17th century witchcraft in the colonies. The book is a little dry, but the facts and bits of colonial wisdom were interesting....not to mention Daniel and wife Abigail's approach to dealing with a house servant who in today';s world would be a resident of the top-floor, inpatient, psych ward."
4,"VERY FINE, BUT AN INCH BELOW ""BRITANNICA""","With a total of eleven thousand pages, this set ""Compton's Encyclopedia"" has reached maturity. It is a versatile well-organized reference tool, which is getting better with each new edition. It is highly dependable, as well.However, the presence of ""Encyclopaedia Britannica"" set continues to dwarf it. It is no match, (when compared to the British giant). Still, its price tag is just half of what ""Britannica"" demands.Hence, I would recommend this ""Compton's Encyclopedia"" for any budget-sensitive researcher, who still wants a reliable all-encompassing information resource."
3,"Clear, concise... but do you have a computer?","I like books as much as the next guy. I just bought a $150 atlas, and love paging through it.Although Compton's is rather complete, for as little as $19.99, you can get Encarta 2004. There is no comparison in the reference experience you will get from the software than from these cumbersome volumes that fickly demand a place to store them."
5,The book is exciting and all the songs are thrilling.,The different rythyms and tempos of the songs in the books really make the playing exciting. I enjoy playing Star Wars songs becuase they are thrilling.
4,I'm Impressed,"This book is awesome for beginners and intermediate manga artists who want to take their art to the next level. It shows you everything you need to know to make characters and a good storyline while keeping you entertained and informed. I was an intermediate artist, and this book showed me a few tricks of the trade. The only thing that could have used a little work on was the translation, but other than that, it's worth a buy."
2,It's an okay book,"I remember this book well because it was the very first ""How To Draw Manga"" book that I purchased. IMO I think some things might be a bit confusing because some of the translating wasn't the best. I also wouldn't reccomend this book for kids because some of it was a bit innapropriate. As far as learning goes...it was okay. I'd still reccommend another book to someone that is a total beginner in drawing manga. I know I was able to learn more when I purchased a book that was more strait to the point and had very clear directions."
4,good buy,I bought this and h How to Draw Manga Volume 2 Compiling Techniques (How to Draw Manga). But i used This book way more than the other one.Its got a very nice Creating Characters section and a Expressions one. And creating a Story.
5,Manga RULZ,"This book was great!! I go to www.howtodrawmanga.com a lot and their books are awesome!! Any amateur drawer who would like to draw manga should buy the Getting Started book and kit, as well as go to www.howtodrawmanga.com. This book is still helpful to me today. MANGA RULZ WHEN U CAN DRAW!!!"
2,Hardback becomes paper back. MAGIC?,The book I ordered was described as a used HARDBACK. When it arrived it had magically become a used PAPERBACK. I needed it ASAP and it wasn't expensive. I didn't want to deal with the hassle and just sucked it up. Absolutely not the way I expected the transaction to go and not the way it should have gone. Small inconvenience but I will probably not do business with these people again. There are too many sellers out there that do it right.
2,Thought it would be good,"I purchased this for my boyfriend upon him returning home from Fallujah. He didn't open it once. It's just not a book that a war veteran wants to read, or even be reminded of. He went through enough and all he really needed was professional help. Not a book that reiterates the pain and struggles that families endure."
2,WORDY,"The book/story started off well, with interesting characters and plot. The two problems I see are this: 1) the author is VERY wordy and this story needed to be edited down by about 1/3. It is 540 pages where 230 would have made a much better read. 2) If you were a leading lawyer in a powerful law firm and it was found that the firm was laudering drug money, which lead to the death of your ex-wife and daughter, would you stay at that firm?? It doesn't seem plausible to me that a powerful man who (in the story) sees his daughter as the most important thing in his life wouldn't have left that firm for another?? It's important because the daughter in witness protection renters his life which leads to obvious problems and such."
3,Eh,While this book is an asset in learning about lesbian history it is seriously lacking in connecting ideas and seperating fact from oppinion. While some points are made well there are some that are so far off that they devalue what ever point the author was trying to make.
5,"A good cd single, they are in the right direction.","If u like the Postal Service, this single is a must! The remixes are very unique, and they arent the usual cliche type of remix u would find on someone's single. This band has a unique feel to their music, and I hope they are around a long time.The cover of the flaming lips song, ""Suddenly everything has changed"" is another gem to add to your collection.This single is highly reccomended, and I also think their last single ""Such Great Heights"" was simply beautiful.keep it goin:)"
1,Couldn't even finish watching this movie,"The acting was mediocre. And how is it that the red-headed nurse looks exactly the same almost 30 years later? And the plot was totally predictable. Can I have my $3.99 and two hours of my life back, please?"
5,A tribute to the great Monster Movies of yesteryear,"Independent filmmaking finally rises to the expected production values of Hollywood with this astounding tribute to the traditional Monster Movie. Credit is deserved and given to a talented, professional, seasoned and patient cast and crew. They are the TEAM, and are credited for making The Tenant what it is..a high quality homage to the monster movie of yesteryear. Special thanks to horror Icon Michael Berryman and rising star J LaRose, with a salute to veteran Bill Cobbs.Now available at Amazon and Netflix and soon at all locations,The Tenant is ready for your inspection. And for fantastic reviews check out the 17 national reviews from the Worlds largest horror magazines, web-sights and networks. Here are a few comments...""...filled with nerve-wracking tension, intense fear...and an astonishing twist..."" A. Gilbert - Joblo.com""Clever Twists and a great cast..."" Michael Gingold - Fangoria"
4,good introduction to fado,"I was introduced to fado sitting at a restaurant in portugal. The lights dimmed, and a musician strode in with his guitar, playing some of the most intimate and mournful music i had ever heard. Half an hour later, then the lights went back on, but this cycle repeated all night.The appeal of hearing ""world"" music (to me) is to hear unfamiliar foreign genres in their purest, most authentic forms. The Rough Guide music series is hit or miss (more often than not, hit). Some anthologies get caught up in slick, modernized, and ultimately dated pop hits that can't really separate themselves from the mass-market pop trash we hear back home, except that the incomprehensibility of a foreign language can sometimes mask the hollowness of the lyrics. This is one of the good ones, and I recommend it as a starting point to figure out which fado artists you like. As for individual artists, Ana Moura's Guarde-me is outstanding from start to finish."
1,Poor Product,"I purchased this product a few days ago and there are multiple problems with it. First off my order was 2 days late, second both of the tabs that hold the box closed are broken, third one of the attachments is broken. It only comes with a brush and swab (on mine the swab is broken). I would not recommend buying it. Buy the Outers Kit instead, it is cheaper and comes with more attachments. It is also non returnable on amazon so now I'm stuck with a pretty much useless cleaning kit."
5,Great for the price.,This is a great basic cleaning kit. The included sollutions are very good quality. You can keep your shotgun very clean for years with this.
2,Welcome to software from the 80s,"This has a terrible interface but it does give you some licks and you can play along. It doesn't offer much in ""instruction"". I pretty much shows your tab and plays the midi notes as it highlights the tab. It's a nice pretty box with just a CD (not a DVD) in it. There is no reason this should cost as much as it does.You are better off looking for tab online and use You tube for the music. This is very old software and it is very hard to ""learn"" a song off of it."
5,Great guitar tool!,"Despite some of the other reviews I love these CD-roms. They are really cool and there is so much you can do with them. (Slow the speed, get some history, loop...)This is an awesome product for the beginning/intermediate guitarist who wants to learn some of the greatest blues songs."
2,"Poor user interface, technical problems",I spent about an hour getting this to work correctly. I am disappointed with the interface and the lack of lesson information. Not a bad product but there are better guitar programs for sure
2,Book had promise but fell short,"Let me first say that i really enjoyed Steve Hamilton's first 2 Alex McKnight books in ""Cold Day in Paradise"" and ""Winter of the Wolf Moon"". However this book just didn't do it for me. It was predictable from the begining that Randy wasnt the great guy he was being made out to be in the first 100 pages. The book dragged on in the first 100-120pages (its only a 300 page hardcover book). When Hamilton finally got to the story i was totally underwhelmed.I wont give away spoilers like other reviewers but one reviewer made a great point. ""Why did randy want to meet Maria?"" That question is never truly answered.A quick recommendation: Dont make ""Hunting Wind"" your first Steve Hamilton book choice. Go get Cold Day in Paradise. If you read Hunting Wind you might be scared away from reading some of his other fine books."
3,"Disappointing after ""The Lock Artist""","It's a fast read, but perhaps not the best introduction to Alex McKnight. It was the first in the series that my library had in the day I decided to start the series. This was a few weeks after reading the terrific ""Lock Artist"". Not sure if I will read a whole lot more of the series though. It took so long for this novel to really get going. About 135 pages in fact. I mean nothing happens to move the plot along until that point. I have to admit that I wasn't actually bored reading about Alex and his old teammate Randy, but exciting is not an adjective I would use in any way shape or form to describe the overly long set up. When things get going it becomes a better story and it has a few good twists, but probably would recommend this book to someone that doesn't want to miss one book in what I am certain is overall a much better series. I gotta believe that this is one of the weaker entries by this talented author."
4,another cold day...,"Why is it that even when it's NOT winter/blizzard/ice-storm season, Steve Hamilton still manages to make Alex and his environs absolutely frigid? Alex is a reluctant private investigator who basically wants to be left alone in upper Michigan (with a cold bottle of Canadian beer). Unfortunately, someone finds Alex. His old team mate re-connects and brings Alex with him on a trip down memory lane. Some memories should be left alone. The story zig-zags back and forth (in a good way) leading us and Alex all over Michigan for answers. If you enjoy hard-boiled, tough guy tales pick up this, or any other Alex McNnight book, and enjoy. And don't forget the bottle of beer!"
3,Plenty of twists to hold your interest,"Steve Hamilton writes books that read like Harlan Coben's Myron Bolitar series crossed with Lee Child. His hero, Alex McKnight, is a former police officer and one time baseball pitcher living the quiet life in northern Michigan. Out of the blue, Randy Wilkins - a former baseball teammate - turns up and asks Alex to help him track down an old flame who he hasn't seen in 30 years. The story starts slowly with what seems to be a simple ""cherchez la femme"" mission, but it quickly emerges that virtually no one and nothing is what it initially seems.Steve Hamilton has created a likable protagonist (imagine a less violent, more human Jack Reacher), but his real gift is keeping the story twisting so that the reader's interest is sustained throughout. Everytime I thought I had a handle on how things would play out, it would surprise me. A nicely crafted thriller."
1,"Dumb, dumb, dumber","Don't listen to those 4 and 5 star ratings, this was truly a dumb story, with no redeeming qualities at all. No point to the story at all that was the truth and the readers were left with the question of why Randy wanted to find Maria in the first place. She certainly was a charmer and had everyone dancing to her tune. Ah men and their peabrains."
2,A Frenetic Search for Lost Love!,"There's something about Alex McKnight that resonates with me. Maybe it's his bad attitude. Maybe it's his sarcasm. Or maybe it's that in the end, he's a sucker like me. In this outing, author Steve Hamilton takes on a ride through Alex's past. Through the streets of Detroit, Alex and his old friend, Randy Wilkins, are off on a crazy search for a girl Randy knew when he played for the Tigers. When Randy gets shot, Alex tenaciously searches for answers. The plot falls short because the set-up isn't that believable and the ending is too abrupt. Furthermore, Randy's personality is quite annoying. I'm glad he got shot. An enjoyable read, but not Hamilton's best."
3,Solid Hamilton,"This Alex McKnight story is a page-turner with a leisurly pace like his first two stories. There is never a deadened moment, and each scene propels the plot forward. Most bestsellers fans probably won't like Alex's stories, but they have yet to disappoint."
1,This is by far the worst book in the McKnight series,"I've read all of Hamilton's McKnight novels and this one is the worst. It took me well over 300 pages to get into this novel and by that point I'd spent so much time reading the book I just wanted to be finished and done with. I've thoroughly enjoyed all of his other novels but this one just seemed to have no purpose, couldn't grab my attention, and was just a painful read. If I wasn't such a fan of his earlier books I would have put this book down after the first 40 pages. I still own this book but wouldn't put anyone through the torture of reading it. If you have yet to read the McKnight series read his first novel, A Cold Day in Paradise, it's a classic mystery."
4,Low-key thriller that holds your interest.,"Alex McKnight gets pulled into his latest case when he is visited by old baseball friend Randy Wilkins, who wants Alex to help him find Maria, a woman he spent a week with some thirty years ago. Of course, things wind up being a lot more complicated than they initially appear.What I liked most about this book were the characterisations. The folks in this book seemed like real people. The dialogue and situations occasionally resulted in some laugh-out-loud moments, which is rare for me. It helped gloss over the fact that this isn't the most twist-laden crime drama you'll read. In fact, if you've seen just one film noir, you'll anticipate just about everything that occurs here. The character revelations didn't exactly have me gasping out loud, and the ending is underwhelming, to say the least.Nevertheless, I really did enjoy this book. Steve Hamilton is a talented writer and I am looking forward to tracking down more books involving these characters."
5,Classic...,"I was lucky enough to buy this DVD on NEARFest 2002 Prog Rock festival for less and had it signed by current Caravan line-up! ( Not to mention that their show on NEARFest was great, easly the best festival performance!) I cannot rate myself as great Caravan/Canterbury fun, but I really enjoy their set!The concert recorded on the DVD took place about 10-15 years long. Caravan was in the great form then ( and now) it played their classic: For Richard, White Wine, Ten Feet Underground, etc. The concert represents Caravan classic line-up: Sinclair bros, Pye Hastings, their original drummer, etc. Highly recommended for Canterbury nuts and all prog heads!"
1,A book about modeling by a headshot photographer,"The author's title (photographer) leads the reader to believe that he is an expert in the field. In fact, there's a lot of misinformation in this book. Buyer beware."
1,Professional Model from Europe,"The writer is a complete idiot. He is nothing more than a headshot photographer (and not a particularly talented one at that), and writes at a first-grade level.This book is worthless trash."
1,MORE SELF-SERVICE BY THE INDUSTRY FOR THE INDUSTRY,How many more modeling books is Eileen Ford going to 'endorse?' When will a writer give young people starting out in the industry some straight talk about where they best fit into the industry and how to make the most of their talents and reach their full potential? This book conveniently sidesteps the BIG CHANGES in the Industry over the last five-seven years. GET REAL PLEASE.
2,Topaz earings,"Earings are in good size, but quality of silver is not good. It is dark.... And corrupted clusp... Now I use this item, but silver is black.... I think it is bad quality of silver."
2,I don't like the subject matter,I found this book to be very depressing - I'm not sure I could even recommend it to someone interested in boxing.
3,The Game,"Powerfully written,in the unique style that only London can bring. Reminiscent of 'To Build A Fire' in its poignancy. The Game is a 'must read' for all London fans."
4,The Game,I like the books by this author he has a distinctive style. The hero is featured in other stories and always seems to create a good yarn.
4,Straight-forward and engaging Jack London,"Jack London had a real interest in boxing, and this work shows just how much he truly understood it. While there is not the development that there was in The Abysmal Brute, this shorter novella holds the interest and has you caring about the characters. It is of historical interest to Jack London fans in that London received negative reviews that called the story's boxing sequences unrealistic, and yet he had letters from championship boxers complimenting him on just how realistic it was."
4,Concise and captivating,In this action-charged tale of young love London pits the innocence of youth against life's ferocity. Fans of boxing will enjoy seeing the sport through the fresh eyes of a young woman cheering for her fiance as he fulfills his promise to end his career with one last bout.
3,"[Bly-ray] Good Show, Decent Treatment","(This is a review of the Blu-ray.) While it is nice to see this overlooked show get the Blu-ray treatment don't expect a remastered transfer. While the picture is clear and crisp they did not clean up the print that was used. Lots of dust and scratches are present throughout. Also the audio is center channel only on surround sound.Having said that, you don't really need surround sound and perfect picture to enjoy the show. We aren't dealing with an HD cineplex blockbuster here. It is a pleasant little Christmas special. It has some touching and funny moments, a few memorable songs, and a nice atmosphere thanks to the voice of Joel Grey. You could quibble a little with the story (Why is Santa prone to holding grudges and being petty in some of these Rankin and Bass stories?)Anyway, $13 is a little steep for what you get, but you cannot complain too much here."
3,Cup Is Half Full,"This is one of my favorite holiday cartoons. This review is about the product not the movie. The dvd worked fine. The Bluray did NOT work (in both my original disc and the replacement disc Amazon sent and in multiple Bluray players). The Bluray previews all had audio but different sound levels. The Bluray Menu Screen had audio. However, when clicking Play the actual movie had NO audio. Possible mass quantity manufacturing defect? I was able to compromise with Amazon and agreed on a reduced price since the dvd in the disc set was fine."
5,favorite christmas story,This is one of my favorite christmas tales. Sweet story/cartoon told by man and mice. The little kids will enjoy it. Typical of time period in which it was made.
5,A GENUINE CLASSIC,"I love seeing this show on t.v., at Christmas time. Now, I have the dvd and can watch it whenever I want. No commercials and great quality sound and picture."
5,If you were a little kid in the 70s...,"you will surely remember this classic. Try to DVR this every season to share with my children. Now we can watch ""on demand."" Great music, great memories. LOVE IT!"
1,Where is my movie??,"I bought this movie before Christmas and I still haven't received it.....I wouldn't have given it any stars, but apparently amazon makes you select at least one. Horrible!!"
4,Great memories.,One of my favorites from childhood. Lesson: your actions have consequences. I use to have this story on an LP.
4,Great childhood memory,I loved watching this show every December when I was growing up. My kids liked it but thought it was a little goofy.
4,Great old holiday movie,"Didn't realize I owned it already, but very happy that I bought it. I gave to the grand-kids for future enjoyment."
5,Snag it! before they realize how much they should charge!!,"I purchased this for a couple of people who create websites and instructional materials. SnagIt is EASY to use and is great for creating short clips for how to videos of desktop software, through screen capture. It is inexpensive to boot."
4,A Great Place to Start,One thing I love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them. Timbuk 3's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not get tired of hearing songs you've heard a million times on the radio. If you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one great web site. After buying this CD and the live one you will have to seach the used bins and I highly recommend the album Eden Alley.
5,misunderstood song...,almost everybody misunderstands The Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades. the song is an ironic view of how our technological advancements are exceeding america's education systems. our schools are not preparing kids enough for what's out there. maybe the poppy music gets in the way-people take it too seriously. listen to timbuk 3's 6-song album released just before 100 Lovers for the acoustic version. it's much darker and you'll probably understand what it's about better.timbuk 3 is one of the best groups out there and their music only gets better over time... sinful life is the ultimate wedding song...
2,Listen to Corey Hart if you want a song about shades...,"I've only heard the first song on this cd, and I hate rate a whole cd based on only one song. And some of the other songs have interesting titles. Hence, I'll be charitable and give it two stars. I have to say it, though, I hate ""The Future's So Bright I Gotta Wear Shades"". Even the title sucks, cause its so enormous. And the music sounds like a techno jug-band hoedown. And the lyrics are just too dopey, even for the era it came out in. I won't judge the other songs, but if they're anything like that one, then you know how I feel..."
5,The Beat of the Bay,"I listen to energy 92.7 daily,and I love them.Subsuequently,I feel the same way for the CD.I've heard many of these songs before on the station and have the hardest time finding the albums in store,so it was nice to have all of them in one CD.If you love dance,trance,or just plain good music buy this CD! It was well worth the purchase."
1,Dumb Dumb Dumb,"I bought this book based on all the delightful reviews - however, I had to force myself to read at least 50 pages to give it a chance before tossing it in the trash. Starts off with Josie being at a commercial filming that involves children. Josie refers to the star of the commercial using a dirty name in front of a child who repeats this to the star. Josie is then fired -- funny? No, dumb. Josie walks onto the balcony of a public building and the glass door shuts and locks behind her. She panics and tries to uproot a potted tree to use to bust down the door. However, after a few minutes someone spots her through the glass door and lets her in, but her clothes are then a mess -- funny? No, dumb. It didn't get any better."
4,Pronghorn Hunting,I was going on my first antelope hunt this fall and wanted to read more than I had in hunting magazines about antelope hunting. I found the book very informative about antelope. I think this is a very good starter book. It would be nice to see a little more advanced hunting methods and processes. There are not many options for books on antelope hunting but this is a good starting point and I would recommend it.
3,It was not all bad.,"The book repeats itself a lot. I do not fell the info about the right firearms to use is accrete. Things like speed I fell are a little exaggerated, prong horn may be the fastest land animal in North America but the 60 M.P.H. of the cheetah is a little out of reach."
3,Great watch...but!,"Good watch, reliable and well made. However the jumbling animation is annoying! If you move your arm it triggers it. It can be annoying to kids to look at their watch and have to wait for the jumbling to stop before seeing the time."
1,Absolute Piece of Junk - Do not buy Timex Watches,"The watch is supposed to be water resistant, but it leaked the first time my daughter took it swimming. Now I have to spend $8.00 so Timex can decide whether or not to repair it under warranty. I will never buy another Timex product."
1,This watch is really small and crappy,The Pictures are misleading. The watch actually is really small and the animation feature super tacky.
3,not for the politically correct,"Unless you can get tolerate repeated racist language, don't bother with this book. It was written in the 60's and it shows. The N-word is used more times here than in most rap songs and it is used exclusively by the white characters. It makes it a little rough to read but definitely worthwhile.The liberation referred to in the title is a divorce case that is taken by a white lawyer. Generally though this book is about a small Tennessee town and its racism."
4,"O2-Cool 10"" Flat Panel Fan","I really like this fan; it's really strong for the 10"". The only bad thing is that after using it for more than 1 hour the fan starts to get warm, and sometimes even hot."
4,"Good air circulation, not top quality","For a battery powered fan, this does the trick quite well and seems to last as long as advertised with fresh batteries, however it's a bit flimsy in construction. When the unit arrived, a part had dislodged giving it an unfinished appearance with wiring exposed. Then I found the part in the box and replaced it, which solved that problem. Installing all the batteries was a bit of a challenge too, as they didn't want to snap into place. Once they were in however, the fan works well and suits my purpose. I'm pleased to see that you can use the supplied jack to plug it into an outlet also, but wonder about the stability if the battery weight isn't there. For now, I'll use it with the batteries as I planned. It's not the 'Maglite' of fans, but does work as advertised."
2,Not a good fan for my use,"The batteries were suppose to last for 40 hours, but they didn't last even 20 hours. Don't promise what the fan is not capable of."
2,somewhat broken,Low speed doesn't work properly. Has dull moments where it loses some power. Not an outlet issue. High speed works as expected and is sufficient. Think it could be a broken one. Would like to return.
4,you can use it all the time,"because this fan runs on power or batteries you can use it anytime you like. Has to settings for low and high, the only thing is that the first one I bought had a handle with a hook for haning it in front of a window this one does not have the handle or the hook, it has to set on the counter or table."
3,"Acceptable, but not great","Pushes a decent amount of air, although can be a little noisy. Expected a little better quality for the price (the case is a little flimsy), but it's acceptable."
2,Was good while it lasted,"The little fan moved a lot of air for it's thin size. However, it was pretty loud. It didn't want to stay upright unless you had it set to the middle position. One click back or forward and it would fall over. I dropped mine from a height of about 3 feet onto a hard floor and 3 of the 5 blades in the fan just snapped off. I'll miss the portability of it but not much else."
1,02 cool mod 1040,In one week I had to buy 2 of these fans (one to replace the other). The problem is they will run for a few hours and then stop working. I was very disatified with this product. Returned both to Walmart.
3,Item #5012 O2 Cool Fan,"The Item # on my fan is 5012. Bought it in 2009 and it worked fine the first night I used it on battries. Second night it started going up and down on the speed of the fan. Ran it on plug in power and it does the same. Noticed the plug in does get rather warm. I like the fan, it blows decient amounts of air for using in a tent and I have used it in my travel trailer when the power went out and it supplyed enough air in the trailer bed room coming from the foot of the bed. Saved the night for me. The most I have ran it on battries is 32 hours on a camping trip and it still had plenty power left. A bit leary of the up and down of the speed, so if anyone knows of this fan shorting out or something, please post it. My fan is quite enough too. I'm not going to recommend it because of the surging and not knowing why, but I'm not throwing mine out just yet!!"
1,Elements of Style,This was not what I was looking for...I needed some help with punctuation and this didn't have it.
2,WARNING!!! This is NOT BuddaheadS !!!,"What are the chances two VERY different groups would come up with virtualy the same unusual name; the only differance being one is the plural form of the other? It would seem the answer is 100%, as that is what has happened here! I bought this cd thinking it was Buddaheads, a high octane, killer blues/rock group in the vein of Hendrix, Trower,or SRV. What I got was Buddahead; a lightweight,pop type group. Apparently amazon is as clueless as I was because they have this cd grouped with Lance Lopez, another kickass blues/rocker. Since fans of either group are very unlikely to care for the music of the other,this warning works both ways. Amazon: try to do something to avoid this confusion in the future so someone else isn't stuck with a cd they don't like."
2,"Decent, but could have been better!",I have to admit that the reason that I bought this book was do to the book's setting. I got half way though the book and I was sorry that I bought it. The characters in the book were completely flat. The writer made no effort to to connect with the reader and I have to say that I had a hard time keeping all the characters names right and what their purpose was in the book. Do yourself a favor and pass on this book.
3,Partners In Crime,"I gave Partners In Crime a 3 star rating,I have read so many books and it has been a while since I read this book. I write down the titles of the books I read and also when I finish a book I write down how I rated it. Unless I give a book a 4 or 5 stars I don't always remember exactly what it was that I liked about each book!! I am sorry if this is not a good enough answer but I feel that everyones opinion is different so go ahead and read the book and come to your own conclusion."
5,Finally! Great new music for parties,"This is the kind of great record Donna Summer used to do, but Becky gives it a real modern edge. I first heard Becky's song ""If You Love Me"" on a compilation CD called Global Hits 2003 --- there are two versions of that on her album, both of them great!! Pop in Becky on a Saturday night and I dare you not to have fun."
3,Dance Diva,"Becky Baeling is a new, emerging dance artist with a hot debut album! If you like uptempo dance music then this is the cd for you. This is also the perfect record for any party you're having. I had the chance to see Becky perform a few of her songs live at a local high school along with ICONZ and South Florida hip-pop group IMIJ - she has so much energy and sings with a lot of passion! She has a unique style and voice and will definitely go far."
4,The Best Pop Diva Ever!!!,"I love Becky Baeling's Album it has alot of edge to it,My 3 favorite song s on her album is Supernova Light,I Snapped & If You Love Me.She is a grest singer with a great vioce for 24 years old.I just got this CD from last month.She is just like Kylie & Britney Spears.Becky is A DIVA!!!"
2,Almost listenable-,"After skimming the reviews perhaps my sights were reaching to high. Everthing from the absolutely ridiculous & unwitty title (Becstacsy)to the stale production and tacky graphics and photos reeked of mediocrity. These mostly void-of-personality songs sounds like they were written by a 12 year old (with the exception of the quite good All Over Me). Universal sitting on a goldmine? Hmm-I highly doubt it. Comparisons to Kylie are laughable, even Kristine W. almost dismissive - these sound like MUSAK versions of much better songs - she has a long way to go- mainly on working with better writers and finding something new to put on the table-because Becky has two things that are evidently going for her - talent, and looks, which is what it takes..and a good song. Good luck to you Becky!"
4,"First off, you gotta get a good hold of the tail","...then if it's small enough you drape it along your arm holding up it's weight. Also included calculating the date of Easter up to A.D.2000 Chinese nicotine-craving control, a few interesting games and my personaly #1 fave, a recipe for genuine Anglo-Saxon mead, a type of beer made from fermented hunny(sic).And a full menu in case you ever happen to have a panda over for dinner! For Catholics there are detailed instructions for becoming either Pope or a saint. My belief: being elected Pope is wayyy easier!"
4,additional handset for existing system,I bought this to expand our 3-handset system.Works well- nice that we don't need phone jacks to have handsets in room throughout the home.
1,Great while it works.. Then warrnty is a fraud.,"Mine did not last even the year. After a lot of calls, I learned the Uniden warranty service would have ended up costing me almost as much in fees and inflated shipping than I paid for the phone.I think they make more in warranty and shipping charges than they do on selling the phone.In the trash."
4,great phone,"I got this handset to replace a lost one. it synched to the base effortlessly. then of course I found the lost one. but now I have two, both work great! great product."
1,disappointing,"BUYER BEWARE My experience with amazon.com and ejcelectronics was not at all good.After 30 days and several emails and phone calls the purchase was finally refunded.I will never do buisness with amazon.com again they never fully made me feel like they were activley involved in helping me with my problem.All i can say is read the fine print on amazon.com website cause if you have a problem with a buisness your on your own.Their A-Z guarantee is a joke,its just a big waiting game telling you to contact the vender 1 on 1.Hope this helps you in making another choice..thank you"
3,Check your Phone Base Capability and S/H Costs,"First, the ship and handling cost were outrageous based on the total cost,weight, and value of the product. The phone I received was taken from another base set. There was no manual or instructions as to how to connect it to my base. You could call their technician. Second, I intended to add another phone to my base, not replace one. My base could not integrate another phone so I have no current use for this product. Sending it back due to restocking and S/H, the cost loss is not an option. BUYER BEWARE!!"
5,Additional Handset,"This was purchased as an additional handset to our existing phone. The phone works well, has everything I could want in a phone and it was easy to transfer saved numbers to the additional handset. Sound quality is excellent."
5,Fantasic little phone !! Can get enough though.,"The only complaint I have is that you can't add more than 3 handsets to the base! Otherwise I would add phones to every room in the house. I agree with all the reviews prior to this. At first I thought the size was a bit small but turns out I prefer it. Another nice feature is the belt clip that makes it very simple to carry with you when you're out in the yard. Great clarity, range and value."
2,BEN,THE PHONE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ADD ON CAPABLE FOR 4 PHONES THE UNIT DID NOT HAVE A CHANNEL 1 ONLY 2 3 & 4 THIS PREVENTED A 4TH PHONE ADD ONOTHER THAN THAT IT WORKS FINE
4,Good for the money,"Discontinued but we have had great success. Got originaly free from Sun Rocket, and bought 2 more. Batteries have started to go and run around 18 dollars a piece. Nice features. Still have phones but not SunRocket"
3,Speakerphone has problems,"May be I got a defective unit from Amazon, but the speakerphone used to sound crackled for a few months and then it totally stopped working. Otherwise it is a great add-on to your exisiting Uniden phone system."
1,NON WORKING Uniden DCX640 2.4 GHz Accessory Handset for DCT Phone Systems,"I ordered this product for my mother's birthday because I have the base unit as my bedroom phone and she kept using it because the house cordless was slowly going. It really made me aggravated that it was never in my room and that she was always using it. I knew they made extentions, so I finally bought one. When she got it and set it all up, it didn't work! You could hear the person that was calling you or that you were calling but THEY COULDN'T HEAR YOU! I figured that it was the ear piece volume that was either low or broken. It must have been the broken, because I couldn't find the volume for the handset ear piece volume! And believe me, I DID read the intruction manual! WORST MONEY EVER SPENT! I'm not saying the product is bad...it very well could've been the place that was selling it through Amazon that sucks."
2,Didn't work for me,"Purchased this unit (2 phone system) 3 weeks ago at W-mart for a little bit more money....needed it in a pinch. Although it has some fairly nice features for the price, it has performed poorly. Although there is no static, both phones produce an echo when the volume is raised past 50%. Friends say they also hear the echo on their end when calling me. The other problem is when the speaker phone is used, the sound cuts in and out, making it sound like a bad cell phone call. I'm on Amazon now, looking for a replacment."
4,KICK ASS!,GREAT CD! GOOD QUALITY! FAST SHIPPING! CLASSIC 80S METAL AT ITS BEST! THIS WAS IN MY COLLECTION AS A CASSETTE AND THE TAPE PLAYER ATE IT AND ITS BEEN YEARS SINCE IVE HEARD IT!
4,a lost classic rereleased,this is great reissued after so many years out of print with a bonus 1993 EP the shore a nearly impossible band release to find.great thrash from the north west a little like prong but pure thrash.
5,Excellent sampler,"I took Orrin Robinson's class ""Introduction to the Germanic Languages"" at Stanford and this was the primary text. The book is a marvelous sampler, with brief sections discussing each language's relation to the others and its historical and cultural significance. Each language is presented through excerpts from major or important works, with translations and ""clues"" in the margins for those attempting to read the original. It definitely helps to have a basic understanding of historical linguistics and some exposure to either modern German or comparative linguistics, but even beginners will find something of interest."
5,Great Overview of Germanic Tongues,"An overview of the surviving tongues of the Germanic peoples. There are chapters on Frankish, Old English, West Goth, Norse, Old German, etc.Easy to read. Layman friendly. Short and to the point."
2,Egg Poacher,I was dissapointed with this product's thin construction. The egg poacher cups are also quite small in size.Medium eggs only. My very old egg poacher could easily accept extra large eggs. Also...I found despite greasing each cup thoroughly a thin white fiil remains on each cup. A scrub brush does not clean this. One must use the course side of a dish sponge with repeated rubbing before storing.
5,Great book,I have my own copy but I wanted a few more to give away. The stories are a powerful witness to God working through St. Therese in such simple ordinary ways.
5,Excellent Book(s)!!,"I highly recommend Elizabeth's books - Shower of Heavenly Roses, The Fruits of Medjugorje and Lourdes! They all grabbed my interest right from the beginning and held it till the end. I found them very interesting, inspirational and easy reads. Looking forward to future books by the author. EXCELLENT books and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
4,Shower of Heavenly Roses: True stories of healing,"Enjoy it very much. Most inspirational and uplifting. Having witnessed my friend's miracle of haveing cancer cured through St. Teresa's intercession, I wanted to see what others had to say about St.Teresa.Shows what faith can do with the help of Holy Saints and God. Faith is the greatest gift that we are given."
3,ANOTHER REPRINT!!!!!!!!!,"...This is a decent read, nothing special. Abby London is hiding a secret, a past with a stalker/jealous boyfriend and an almost affair with her cousin's husband when cousin was pregnant. Now someone is trying to blackmail her because of it.Torr Latimer, is a man she meets in a flower arranging class. After 1 date is declaring he owns her etc....so dated. These are not bad reads. And I often like to catch the ones I missed, but I really resent very dated books being fostered off on us with high prices...."
2,Bleh,"I'm usually a big JAK fan, but this one was nothing to write home about. I couldn't help wondering why the heroine would want to end up with such an overbearing jerk. :) When the hero isn't someone you'd want to get to know, the book isn't enjoyable."
3,Moderately decent slashed with creepy,"Abby and Torr are a reasonably good couple together; she's endearing, moral, and fairly amusing, and they have decent chemistry together. The rest of the plot is a fairly low-key mystery that suits Krentz's older books.Here is what is strange about this book:""I think,"" he whispered huskily, ""I'd give you just about anything you wanted except...""""Except what?""Your freedom, Torr finished savagely in his head.That is not comforting in any way, shape, or form for the male lead to say. Every once in awhile, into what is otherwise a perfectly average book, that type of overbearing, intimidating and excessively controlling alpha male attitude is inserted, and far from romantic, it results in being quite creepy. A degree of tolerance is greatly needed if one wants to round out the Krentz collection; otherwise, stick to her other books."
1,"Just because it's old, doesn't mean it's a classic","If you enjoy Jayne Ann Krentz for its spunky heroines and quirky heroes, then don't buy this book. I gave up after a few chapters. It's original copyright date of 1984 should have been a warning: Abby, the heroine, is ditzy, and Torr, the hero, is patronizing and sexist. I'm so glad Krentz's style grew, but I'll stick to her more recent titles."
2,Controlling Hero -- Not for Me!,"This book is not a keeper or even a book I care to finish. The Hero goes around proclaiming 'she is his and what's to think about and it's a done deal', etc. As another reviewer stated, what a dated stale romance this is! I'm glad young girls today don't read this kind of tripe on a regular basis! Avoid this book, put the money in the church basket or give a big tip to a hard working server!"
4,Uneasy Alliance,"Good story, a little ""dated"" in the way the main characters interacted. Torr was overbearing in protecting Abby and she should have objected stronger given her past experience."
2,UnLikely Scenario,This novel is a bust. It's hard to get into the storyline when you don't even like the characters. Torr Latimer in a nutshell is a bully that makes every decisions like Abby London is 5 yrs old. Abby London is the ultimate pushover not able to directing her own affairs. Plus a plot that is so unlikely that you wonder how it was written. I love Jayne Ann Krantz but this is a pass.
3,good in theory,"I found this book informative in theory only. It doesn't tell practical advice on what to do to train dogs, only how dogs behave."
3,"OK, but it could be much, much better.","A decent book, with a sound enough training method, but very lacking in several areas. First, it doesn't go into hardly any detail. When I do something, I would like to know not only IF it will work, but HOW and WHY it will. She only tells you what to do, not why. Also, I felt talked down to, and I really don't like that feeling. Get this one from the library, and save the money for a better book, by Joel McMains or Karen Pryor for example."
1,Would Rate it No Stars if Allowed,"This was written in 1978, every suggestion is practically to yank on the choke chain, or put the dog down. What a stupid, stupid book written by a woman who obviously hates dogs. I would guess she was looking for something she could dominate, since her husband probably cheated on her constantly.Here is an actual line from the book:""However, by tightening my hold on its choke chain I got the desired effect, and it flopped on the ground beaten and winded.""I don't know about you but ""flopping on the ground beaten and winded"" is certainly not how I would ever like to see my dog. Training is hard work and takes dedication and time, not abuse. If you even consider trying these techniques you should not own a dog.This is an old, old book and should not even be on the market any more."
4,Good basic dog training book.,"If you've never trained a dog, start here. Barabara's philosphy is that most dog problems are ""owner"" problems. That dogs key into what their owners are thinking. That said, Barbara uses corrective training techniques with a choke chain. The current thinking is that you need to also use ""reward"" based training.Some trainers use only one of the other. I claim you need to tailor it to the particular dog. Some dogs couldn't care less how much you yank them around by the neck, others will quit behaving after they've had enough treats. Anyway reward based training requires lots of variations in the reward, sometimes its a game of frisbee.With corrective training you need to assert yourself as the head of the pack. Seems to work well with some dogs, especially those more alpha pack dogs. But all dogs require lots of rewards to be well adjusted. And as you can see from the cover photo Barbara does reward her dogs."
4,No Bad Dogs The Woodhouse Way,"This book was a good primer for understanding the basics of dog behavior and the psychology of dog training. The book gives a general understanding of how to perceive the mind of a dog. It also stresses that the personality of the owner can enhance or detract from dog performance. The best attribute of the book is that it teaches the nature of true love, honor and respect between dog and master. I would like to see Ms. Woodhouse do a followup with more details and pictures on basic dog training techniques."
2,Not bad but could be better,Thankfully I got this book from the library and did not spend the money on it. I found it too generalized with the only method of teaching to be a collar jerk using a choke chain. She catagorized dog problems by chapters. Each chapter was at most 2 pages long. She did not spend the time to fully explain her chapters and most of the time offered no advice. A much better book to read is Mother Knows Best by Carol Lea Benjamin.
5,ABSOLUTELY worth the money - the funniest yet,"If you have never seen this duo, get this dvd - it is ""the best of"" really. You will laugh and laugh. I purchased the entire set, this was included, and am watching it for the 2nd time around. I believe this duo to be the funniest comedy I've ever watched and the best money I've ever spent on dvds. I am sure we will watch it over and over again - just use subtitles if you aren't from the UK, so in the places where they talk really really fast (as part of the comedy), you can understand it all -- especially with ""Vicky Pollard"". LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!"
5,full of catchphrases hilarious,My girlfriend and I are constantly saying Bittie? and poop! if you love me you'd do it. this show is over the top hilarious. But only 6 episodes on this dvd is a disappointment
1,Little Britain-Abroad,"Unlike the other Little Britain dvds which have several episodes. This one only had 2, so I felt somewhat cheated."
2,Really cute ...,but that's about all it has going for it. The washcloth is really small and can't really be used for much of anything. The bib has a very small opening to go around the neck and my baby is only 6 months old and weighs in about 15 lbs and it doesn't fit her. Everything rolls right off of it and it cannot be used to wipe baby's mouth. I don't think I would recommend this product.
4,Cute Set,This is such a cute set!! The only problem I have with it is that the tag on the washcloth is very hard and rigid so I have to be careful not to use that area on my baby!! The presentation is very cute and would make a nice gift.
3,Definately A Debut!,"Janet was 16 years old when she made her debut album and it sounds like songs writtenby and/or for a 16 year old.Glossyteenybopper dance music is dominant on ""(You'll Never Find) A Love Like Mine"",""Young Love"" and ""The Magic Is Working"".But onthe Thriller-like opener ""Say You Do"",the sassy electro-funk of""Don't Mess Up This Good Thing"" and the tough rocking ""Come GiveYour Love To Me"" producer Leon Sylvers elevates a mediocre albuminto a promising begining for this particular talent.But betterdownload those cuts or something because the ALBUM is prettyso-so elsewhere."
2,Average but some decent songs,"""I got this Album when it first came out because I dug ""Say You Do""&.""Young Love""this Album though on a whole had some moments&interestingly has a More Grown Up vibe that alot of the stale stuff She has done in recent Years IMHO.the Sound&Production was good for the time period.I like this Album better than Her ""Dream Street"" AlbumThe ""All 4 U"" Album.Janet wasn't too bad on Here Vocally it was passable....."
2,A Debut Not Likely Of Janet Jackson,"Janet Jackson's debut album is what not what we expect of her now. Sure the album is filled with cute bubble-gum tunes with sweet little beats, but Janet merely learned the songs and sang them. She should really begin to take ""control"" over her own music by writing her own material (which she would in four years prior to this release)."
3,A nice teen pop-soul record,"I like this album a lot. As another customer said, it's very representative of the 80s sound. It wasn't quite the failure that many historians make it out to be. ""Young Love"" made the top 10 on the R&B chart, and ""Say You Do"" made the top thirty. Not too bad for a 16-year-old girl. It's got a lot of significance in that she worked with some of the best producers of the time. Rene and Angela (""My First Love,"" ""I'll Be Good"") produced the first half of the record, including the above-mentioned tracks. Their trademark sound is very very strong on those tracks. She also worked with producers from the Solar Records camp, the people responsible for the success of groups like Shalamar and the Whispers. So there's quite a bit here to savor, and it's a good picture of her start as an artist."
3,Nice Debut Album,"This is where it began, the career of Janet Jackson, she was 16 at the time of its release, and who knew that she would acheive so much in her career. While this certainly isnt her best work, and it didn't receive much attention, its still a fun album to listen to. The songs are infectuous. The album is very Jackson sounding, with songs like Say You Do, Youll Never Find (A Love Like Mine) and Young Love, and theres also some ballads here like Love And My Best Friend, and Forever Yours. Her voice isnt that strong here but its still nice, I mean this is her debut album and she didnt hit it big until Control in 1986, but this is still worth checking out."
3,THIS IS HER FIRST ALBUM,"This is Janet's first album and it is a good representation of pop/r&b/dance of it's day. It had a couple of minor hits (Young Love, and the funky new wavish Come Give Your Love To Me). ""Love and My Best Friend"" is an emabrassing clunker though. ""Say You Do"" is much better. As with all of Janet's albums this is worth checking out."
2,"Average material, a very, very weak beginning!","No wonder Janet didn't make it with this debut. She was presented with such weak material to work with! I truly felt sorry for her on this weak, sub-disco thumper set of songs..."
5,Janet is breaking into the music world!,"This a wonderful album. It really deserves a lot more credit than it recieved. Janet is a wonderful artist, and this album was a very good foundation to her career."
5,Party Classic!!!,"This CD showcases Janet in her youthful, carefree, early 80's dance pop phase. Features such (should've been) hits as ""Young Love,"" and ""Say You Do."" A must for any Janet fan!!!"
3,Bubble gummy and glittery at the same time !,"This album will defenatly put a smile on your face. With it's soulfull dancey tunes, along side Janet's young soft voice, ""Janet Jackson"" is a wonderful debut CD."
3,Miss Early Jackson,"I really enjoyed the album especially ""Come give your Love to Me""which I can remember it being a big Klub hit out here in L.A."
4,Just Dido Just Unjust Fate,"This play is a plot of conflicting interests. The survivors of Troy, Aeneas first of all, are saved by Dido, Queen of Carthage. Dido an Aeneas fall in love by decision of Venus. Iarbas who is in love with Dido, is rejected. Anna, Dido's sister, is in love with Iarbas and sees hope in that. But the gods have other projects. Jove imposes his decision : Aeneas wust go to Italy to instal the remnants of Troy there. So Aeneas leaves. Dido then kills herself, Iarbas follows suit and Anna does the same. Marlowe is cruel with his characters and endorses the gods' tyranny entirely. There is no escape from fate. There is no hope for men and women alike. This vision of humanity as a plaything in the hands of the gods is extremely disquieting and pessimistic.Dr Jacaques COULARDEAU"
4,An Excellent Value,"This grill/griddle is an excellent value, but at more than 15 pounds it is not for weaklings. The pre-seasoning makes it a joy to immediately jump in and start cooking.Because it is reversible, the grease lip on either side causes it to block the air flow to the gas burners and not allow them to burn at full BTUs. It is necessary to slightly tip or angle the griddle to achieve full heat for searing meat. If your burners are wide enough, this may not be a problem, and should make no difference on an electric range."
1,Faberware Cast Iron Double burner Grill,"I cannot rate this as I still have not received it. the price is great but I have had to wait for over a month so far and it still has not shipped. ????? It showed ""In stock"" when I first ordered it and it was supposed to ship 1/20 to 1/27 - then it quickly changed to 2-4 week ship dates. MMMm Service has not been so good on this item."
5,"Powerful, versatile strobe lighting","I had the Westcott Spiderlite with florescent lamps for continuous lighting, and I needed a single, powerful strobe. Monolights seemed the answer, but they seemed high priced for adequate power. I went to a Westcott catalog and found they had the set of strobe lamps with modeling lamp for the Spiderlite that fills the bill at a relatively low cost compared to a monolight. One can easily use the strobe set with a sync cable (included, although it's short) or by using an on-camera flash that will trip the slave function of the strobe lamps. And, of course, I still have the continuous-light florescents for use when I need them. By the way, this set is ONLY useful if you already own a Spiderlite fixture."
5,"For price buy them, cannot go wrong!","Not as good as others but well worth the price as my others are four and eight times more, that sure sound better but not always at hand and not five times better, very nice to have around in their little very nice case for immediate use with any players or computer at hand,still great sound period...recommended!"
1,Worst ever.,"These are great earphones... IF YOU STAND COMPLETELY STILL !Sound is good enough... but every little movement or bumping against the cord results in a boom heard through the earphones... I can't imagine anyone getting used to that... for me, at least, it makes them practically unusable...The stock iPod earphones may not sound as good, but at least they don't transfer the sound of every bump to your ears...You would do well to pass these by..."
3,Not for beginners,This text is pretty in depth and imo not for beginners. In alot of the exercises the sentences are in characters with no translation or even translated instructions. Can make you easily confused and feel non-productive. If one already has experience and is brushing up I'm sure it's fine. But as a beginner it is above me.
4,Mentoring: Helping Employees Reach Their Full Potential,"Well written, easily understood. Good guidelines regarding expectations and characteristics of both mentor and mentee. Excellent info regarding creation of a mentor/mentee agreement. Includes two outlines of typical mentor training modules. Great basic tool to assist in development of a mentoring program."
3,"Good Death album, with remastering flaw","It's a superb album, and would deserve 5 stars. However, the digital download of ""Suicide Machine"" has a mixing error in it 2x (listen to the voice). That's a real shame."
4,It's unlikely you'll hear any of these numbers being covered by the San Francisco Symphony any time soon,"It's unlikely you'll hear any of these numbers being covered by the San Francisco Symphony any time soon, which is somewhat of a shame. I think this album is much more interesting than anything Metallica's done in the last 25 years or so.I agree with all of the positive comments thus far on Death's ""Human"" other than one small caveat. I don't think of this as death metal. Death metal involves a lot less mental precision than this music does. Also the vocals aren't ""bearish"" enough to be death metal. However, I can see how Death maybe led some less talented bands to try what became death metal.Enough said. It's a great album. Add it to your collection, unless you suck. Then don't."
5,death kills again,"this cd rocks.The whole cd is a non stop thrash fest.The riffs are in the slayer vain and their are iron maidenesqe harmonies.chucks voice is very raw but not muddy like deicide.flattening of emotions,suicide machine and lack of comprehension are my piicks."
4,Much better than the average martial arts book!,"I especially liked the chapters on forms and the meaning of a black belt. Mike ignores all the silly controversy about these issues and gets right to the meat of the issue with thought-provoking observations.I got a little bogged down in the sections with photos and demonstrated techniques. There was nothing wrong with them, but elsewhere in the book the idea seemed to be to think outside the box and forget specific styles, as in the section on using flexible weapons. When he got down to specific techniques it blunted that challenge a bit.But that's a nitpick. Technically the book was very solid; Mike's a good writer and a lot of these kinds of books are terribly written. Refreshing to see one written by someone who can actually string two sentences together coherently."
4,Essential Alice -- get the MP3,"The core of her jazz talent: No sax, no strings, no Indian chants, just Alice in a jazz trio setting -- Alice (Harp, Piano, Organ), Rashied Ali (Drums, Percussion), Ron Carter (Bass).Also check-out her harp contributions to McCoy Tyner's 'Extensions' CD."
4,Good for beginner,"Oracle 101 Web applications is a very good book for the beginner of web development using oracle.The book explains how to develope the Web application using the Oracle techology in a simple and understandable way. It includes the whole cycle of development such as step by step installation of the database, Web Server and Application Server, how to design the web page then how to use different techology (java servlet,jsp, psp,html) to code the web pages. The Author explains and compares the advantage and disadvantage of different language which make us to know when to use the corrent language. Also, the book can make you clearly understand how oracle achieve different new techology (jsp, servlet,psp,pl/sql) in Application server and Apache Server.If you want to understand how Oracle can achieve the internet techology , this is a great book to start."
2,Very good intro; some appl logic examples could be improved,"I should have rated this 3+ stars, but it doesn't look like Amazon.com is going to let me change the rating.This book will give you a good intro to Oracle's PL/SQL Web Toolkit as well as the numerous other options that Oracle offers for developing web-based applications. Its examples promote a number of good techniques for segmenting business and presentation logic, but break down a bit when illustrating how application logic should be segmented into procedures.Use this as a good place to get started, then follow-up with individuals who have built larger scale PL/SQL Web Toolkit applications (via Oracle user groups, OTN, or newgroups) for additional insight on good application architecture. I would also recommend getting a good book on DHTML, CSS, and JavaScript to round out the picture (such as Danny Goodman's Dynamic HTML from O'Reilly)."
5,Great castle,"My 4 year old got this from Santa, Santa didnt want something that had a lot of little parts that would get lost. It seems durible and I havent had anything fall apart. The knights and horses came with swords, helmets, and lances. There are red knights and black knights and a king. Its great too, that all the other Imaginext Adventure toys come in the same scale, so they can become part of the castle too."
5,Imaginext Adventures Castle Playset,"BEST GIFT my son received this past Christmas. He absolutely loves this and insists on sleeping with it at the end of his bed every night. There are some small pieces but not that bad. The imagination that is evoked when he plays with this is just fantastic! (He's 3 years old) One problem is the draw bridge won't close sometimes, gets stripped out. But my husband has been able to fix this every time by tightening or loosening the screws for it. Everything else works great."
5,Hours of fun for all!,"We bought this for our (nearly) 4 year old son for Christmas. He loves dropping the men into the dungeon, opening the secret staircase and making up stories. The drawbridge stopped working pretty much as soon as we got it, but it hasn't ruined the toy. Little 17 month old brother loves it too. Now we are looking for some of the figures that go with it for a full army!"
5,Great Toy,My 3 year old loves this castle. Good sturdy high quality product. I will continue buying the imaginext products for my son.
3,Great Castle for Little Ones - but Already Breaking!,"This is an awesome castle set and both my 4yo and 2yo love it. There are lots of cool ""secret"" passages that open when you put the knights feet into them, great accessories including dragons, wizards, good and bad knights - everything you need for some great medieval imaginative play. I do like the Imaginext products better than Playmobile - for the younger set anyway. My only complaint is that our drawbridge is already broken and we've only had this castle a week! It doesn't sound like anyone else has had this problem and my boys are hard on toys but I would have thought it would have lasted for more than a week. Even with the broken drawbridge, though, it is a great set."
4,How much ?,"I paid $ 19.98 on Sale at Toysrus for this Imaginext Castle, Amazon wants how much ? Who has unlimited money to burn ?"
5,A Great Buy,"We bought this castle as a Christmas gift for our son who just turned 5. He already had many of the Imaginext knights and wanted the castle to go along with them. Since Christmas, this has been the toy he plays with most often! He loves the many levels, areas, and little nooks and crannies - someone is always searching for a hidden treasure, trying to escape, or trying to bring down the evil ruler of the castle.Overall I would say the castle is well and creatively designed, and although not small, it can fold for better storage (many smaller pieces can fit inside). It also has a carrying handle, and is tough enough to be toted from room to room and take all the rough use a 5 year old can dish out.Add in the free shipping and knowing you won't have to search stores for this hard to find item, and I'd definitely recommend buying the Imaginext Castle from amazon.com!"
1,only one cool song..,"only one cool song, the rest is open to interpretation.. not to cool.. better off to buy the song digitally.."
4,Beautiful soundtrack to a beautifully stylish film,"Stewart Copeland's soundtrack to Rumblefish is such an essential part of the movie that listening to it brings back all of the gorgeous imagery from Coppola's film. The one and only song on the soundtrack, ""Don't Box Me In"", features the unique vocals of Wall of Voodoo's Stan Ridgeway, himself a great storyteller. The mostly percussive soundtrack (of course!) has a wonderful flow mirroring the reflective nature of the film then ramping up the pace to match moments of chaos and danger. This is a very lovely and enjoyable record, probably more suited to fans of Philip Glass, Eno and Krautrock than Police groupies."
4,The strangest music...fits a strange movie.,"Every song on this CD is worth your time. I like, ""Don't Box me in"" the best. However, it's the only song that has lyrics, everything else is just music, but guarenteed you have never heard anything like it before."
5,Rumble Fish,"I am a lover of Copeland and for me , this is his best. A definate must have for any Copeland fan."
1,"DEFECTIVE, DON'T BUY IT","I bought this from Princeton Tec through Amazon. This was not a knock-off product as other reviews may suggest. My purpose was to use this while ice fishing at night. I liked that it came with quality Duracell batteries, and that it was bright. Why the poor review?...IT STOPPED WORKING IN THE FIRST 30 MINUTES OF USE!! Within the first half-hour of the first fishing trip I turned the light on and off maybe 5 times before the on-off button would no longer work...the light wouldn't turn off. I thought maybe it could be reset if I pulled the batteries out and put them back in, but then it wouldn't turn on again. I let it sit in my warm house for a few days, and still doesn't work. Tried new batteries, doesn't work. I do not recommend this product to anyone. The function buttons (on-off, and mode) were difficult to push while I was wearing it, and as I also found out, the buttons are not quality engineered and fail quickly."
5,Great product!,"I am very happy with my purchase of the Princeton Tec Corona headlamp. I will be using it in an upcoming adventure race. Not only is it bright, but it fits comfortably on my head."
2,"Promises even flood of light, delivers uneven narrow beam","The Corona's description says it ""floods your entire field of vision with an even distribution of light"". Not even close. It uses eight narrow-focus LEDs that point in the exact same direction so you get a tiny dot of light directly in front of the lamp and little or no illumination anywhere else. It's like a maglight that's been set to narrow beam. Worse, the dot is bright blue in the center and yellow around the edges.I've had a Princeton Tec Apex for coming up on a decade. It's been almost perfect the whole time, but as a close work light the beam is too narrow so I bought the Corona based on the description. It was a mistake. The Apex has a wider, more even field of illumination with more even color than the Corona, so the Corona is going straight back. Too bad."
3,a different bike light,"I use the Corona as a bike light. I put it on me bike helmet and it brights the path ahead about 70 or 80 feet (relective signs and license plates stand out nicely)Since it is LED the batteries don't go south near as quick as a conventional light, and having your light on your head is a real advantage on a bike, checking your chain, or seeing something off to the side is as easy as turning your head.It was worth the price, especially using rechargable batteries."
5,Headlamp,"Excellent product; durable straps, well-built materials on headlamp and battery case; bright LEDs and outstanding variable lighting options."
4,Just what I wanted,"Very nice headlamp. Comfortable, the top strap really helps. Well-made with several brightness options,"
4,Depends on your interests.,"If it was just my own opinion, I'd give this book 5 stars, but I really like animals and shapeshifters and such and for someone who wasn't so interested in that could easily get bored. I like the laid back parts on the beach or in the cages because it feels more real. Adventures aren't action after exciting action after exciting action. Lots of it IS down time. Now, don't get confused, there is plenty going on and definitely some scenes full of action, but there are times to where the story is just... developed. I think this book is worth reading, and I, personally enjoyed it. i found the writing beautiful and the plot fascinating. However, if you are a struggling reader or have difficulties with attention span, this is probably a book you'll never finish. See for yourself though, and find out if the lost-on-a-deserted-island story with a major twist is for you."
1,stupid,"i agree this is so stupid! i mean honestly it seemed ok but then it became a ton of weird stuff, also i guess if you see past the weird stuff it could be concieved as creepy i felt like i might vomit when it talked about the dead people! But im not strong stomached either. Overall though i think it is dumb, thinking about it realistically or i guess just visualising it it is completly ridiculas!!!!!!"
4,Must Read,"This story is one of the few books in which you care so much for the characters that while reading the book you will want to yell out to the characters, telling them what to do. The realistic environment that Ann Halam creates is beautiful and yet scary when it needs to be. The only downfall of this book is that near the middle of the story it starts to go verily slow, but try to read through that and you will read an amazing story of friendship and courage."
5,it works,Bought this CD to play at naptime in a child care center. Played it to see what it was and kept it to use for my own meditations and bought another for the center.
5,Better than the first Spiderman soundtrack!,"I bought Spiderman 2 soundtrack first day before opening night of Spiderman 2 and I really enjoyed the songs that were on. The only thing I don't get is that some of the songs weren't even in the movie but still it doesn't matter it's really good including Danny Elfman's amazing score. My favorite songs are probably all of them but the best songs I like are Ordinary, Vindicated, Woman, Hold On, We Are, and Someone to Die For. Those are my most favorite out of them is Ordinary best song on there."
4,GREAT!,"tis Amy....i love this cd! it has all of my favorite bands in it, Ataris, dashboard confessional, taking back sunday, etc. All of the songs are great. after listening to all the guys, it was nice to hear a girl on it, Ana. the last two ARE a bit weird, but every great movie has one of those. My favorite song out of all of them was Gifts and Curses by Yellowcard. They are my favorite band cuz they're just awsome. they can never go wrong. everything they do always make them better. i love the, i guess u can call it the ""bridge"" part, where it's just music for like 2 minutes becuz it's really nice and calm and it gets really suspendful...hehe i sound like a dork...."
3,The Movies Way Better!,"I'm so glad I didn't actually pay money for this album. I like Spiderman and everything, but the music is pretty boring and dull. The best song by far on the album is Vindicated by Dashboard Confessional and the second best is the Taking Back Sunday one. You may think that the cd sounds good by looking at the bands but its like they pick the worst songs from bands and put them on a cd. The Train one is also good to I supose, but other then those 3 songs there really isnt anything good on it."
3,Where's the Asian violinist?!,"This soundtrack is OK--not the best, not the worst. ""Ordinary"" IS ordinary, not very memorable. Speaking of memorable, I would've given this at least one more star if it had included that Asian violinist from the movie singing the old Spidey theme song. She was friggin' hilarious!"
4,Question,I haven't actually heard the soundtrack because I really only want one song. Does anyone know the name of the first song played at the end of the movie during the credits and is it on the soundtrack? Thanks!
4,I'm so happy,"That Jimmy Gnecco has finally gotten some sort of exposure to a large audience. For any of you out there who don't recognize him he is the lead singer for a band called Ours. They are absolutely fantastic. They have 2 albums that were released on dreamworks: Distorted Lullabies and Precious. They are making a new album right now with Rick Rubin. I love this soundtrack overall I think there are some great tunes on it from some bands I really enjoy, but my biggest excitement is that Someone to die for will bring more people to the wonderful music of Jimmy Gnecco."
3,Why do I even bother buying CD's anymore?,"First off, I haven't listened to the whole album yet. There might be some great songs. But I didn't buy the album for those songs - I bought it for the music from the movie trailer. I looked for a Spider-Man 2 Score CD but only the Soundtrack is listed anywhere... I see Danny Elfman's tracks there on the soundtrack. These 2 tracks have nothing to do with the movie trailer theme. They sound pretty Batmanish (I don't mean that as a knock against Batman), and not too engaging...Sorry for knocking the CD... I'm crawling up the walls waiting to see the movie!Update: The music I wanted is called ""Lacrimosa"" by Immediate Music. I found the track online and have it on my mp3-player for the gym."
1,where's the theme song?,I was hoping this would include the Michael Buble song which is on a separate single. Phooey!
3,Bah.,"I don't really know what the hype with ""Vindicated"" is.. But i've been a long time dashboard fan, and this song is absolutely horrid. It's such an obvious song, it's not even funny. Just... BAH."
4,Awesome,"The Spider-Man 2 soundtrack is extremely exceptional. Rock songs seem to be a big hit on this CD. The songs fit very well with the CD, and ""Vindicated"" is a great opening song... And is also a favorite of mine!"
3,Soundtracks should be from the film...,"I am a huge fan of movie scores. I just came back from seeing Spiderman 2, and I must say that everything in this movie was done with some special TLC including the orchestral score by composer Danny Elfman.I wish that Sony would release a full score soundtrack instead of the paltry 15 minutes in the 2 tracks which are just ""compilations"" of the music. The rock music is good for their own CDs, but please someone tell the recording industry to at least publish the musical score they spend so much money on in the recording studios anyway for the film itself."
2,"Bellow average, not worth the money !","The Spiderman 2 soundtrack isn't that good. There is barely enough listening value in the whole entire cd, I'm sorry to say the only half way decent song is ""Vindicated"" by Dashboard Confessional""! The rest of the songs rate average to bad. I was disapointed, it could have been better. Don't waste the money on the soundtrack just get the movie!!!"
4,Suprisingly Great!,"I wasn't the biggest fan of the first Spiderman soundtrack, but thought I'd give this one a try, and I'm not dissapointed at all. It's wonderful.Here's a synopsis of some of the tracks.Vindicated- Probably the worst song on this CD, didn't really like it too much, and this is coming from a huge Dashboard fan. It gets old hearing the same whiny voice all the time. A very weak trackOrdinary- OMG. This is an amazing song. Train is known for hits like ""Calling All Angels"" and ""Drops of Jupiter"", but this one just flat-out rocks. Way to go TRAIN!Woman- Very cool. This and ""Ordinary"" made the album.String music- neat way to end the soundtrack.Overall, besides Dashboard.. a great album! enjoy!"
4,Great just like the movie.,I just got this CD after seeing the movie. I wanted the ending credits song. (Vedicated by Dashboard Confessional) I think they did a great job at the selection of artists on the CD considering Peter Parker's personality. He is so Emo. Although I wouldn't recommend this CD to just anyone. You definitely have to have a sort of taste for more of the punk rock persuasion. Even then I'm afraid that some people will be stand offish to the pop-punk qualities of the CD. But in the end there is a reason why they are so popular. Give it a chance! It might surprise you.
5,One really cool soundtrack!!!,"Although I haven't watched the movie yet, I can say that they've put a really decent soundtrack togetehr. You get Maroon and Train on it, a kinda pop-rockers whom I really like. Then you also get Jet, great aussie rockers. But the best is yet to come. There are also songs from Lostprophets and Smile Empty Soul, both being one of my favourite bands. And on the end, you geat a really great, super, fantastic song from Ana, titled We Are. This song is a really great pop song and I listened it quite a few times.This is why thsi cd is worth getting it."
5,Much better than the first Spiderman soundtrack!,I enjoyed it a lot better than the first Spiderman soundtrack. The first Spiderman soundtrack didn't have all the songs from the movie and including the songs from the trailers which I really wanted to hear. The best song from the first Spiderman was Hero by Chad Kroger. It's an awesome song. Spiderman 2 has better songs than the first Spiderman even though the songs weren't in the movie. I bought it before the movie came out first day and I enjoyed almost all of the songs including Danny Elfman's amazing score. You will like this better it's worth a buy. If your a Spiderman fan.
1,Mediocrity itself....,"The music is utterly mediocre run of the mill pap. When will movie soundtracks get more creative? Why is it only Quentin Tarantino who can cook up good soundtracks? The great crime here is that this CD didn't include that awesome Chinese violin lady from the movie who performed the Spider Man theme in a wonderfully atonal and comedic manner. They also didn't have the lounge version of the theme, from the closing credits."
1,Don't Worry! The Score is on the Way!,"The score was great! It really expanded on Part One's themes. But don't worry, the score is coming out July 20th according to http://elfman.filmmusic.com/!!Of course they do this to make more money. All the true soundtrack fans will unfortunately buy this thing just to get a little score music while they postpone the score's release.It's really too bad they treat movie score fans this way. Why not release them at the same time? Or at least the day the movie comes out!Grr!"
3,Solid Spidey Soundtrack,"This is a solid if not amazing soundtrack to the second Spider-Man film. ""Vindicated"" and Train's ""Ordinary"" are the highlight aswell as the strong ""Did You"" and ""Hold On"" from Jet. Elsewhere there is ""Gifts And Curses"", ""Woman"", ""This Photograph Is Proof"" (I Know You Know), ""Give It Up"", and the powerful ""Lucky You and The Night That The Lights Went Out In NYC"".But the absence of ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" and the 60s cartoon Spider-Man TV theme tune is disappointing. Danny Elfman's Doc Ock and Spider-man suites are impressive, but more would have been nice considering the larger amount of exposure his score got on the first film's soundtrack."
4,Good Soundtrack,"I loved the first movie's soundtrack, and thankfully, this one is just as good. Dashboard Confessional's ""Vindicated"" is a perfect choice as the movie's first single since it perfectly captures the character of Peter Parker. I enjoyed all the songs. The most surprising song on here was Train's ""Ordinary"". I'm not the biggest Train fan. I think they can be too sappy for their own good, but this song is probably the best thing they've ever done. Jet, Yellowcard, Maroon 5, and lostprophets were also very good. I also liked Ana, an artist I've never heard of but who sounds like she could be a star. I also liked this CD because it gave me a chance to hear artists I'd never heard before.If you like straightforward rock music, then buy this CD. It's good music for a very good movie; what more could you ask for?"
2,Poor,"Despite having good descriptions, the book does not contain enough modern guns, and lists too many ancient ones. For example, there is not a single mention of a Glock handgun in the whole book! Worthless, in my opinion."
2,Disapointing,"Although quality of skating and costumes are superb the rink is so small i kept wondering how they don't bump into each other. The rink is tiny small, didn't allow any choreography and skating.It is a ballet on ice but on a tiny rink with no familiar faces.Disappointing altogether."
2,misleading product description,"I bought this movie thinking it was the 1987 version that was shown on TV. Its NOT. Robin Cousins and Rosalynn Sumners are NOT the stars like the product description says. VERY misleading... this movie stars Inna Volianskaya and Valery Spiridonov with choreography by Tatiana Tarasova. I havent opened it yet... because I may return it. If anyone knows where to find ""The Sleeping Beauty: An Ice Spectacular"" with choreography by Lar Lubovitch (1987) please let me know!!"
4,Have Your Maginfying Glass Handy,"The Oxford Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus is an up-to-date, handy, clear reference book for one's reading table. I wanted a dictionary of American English. Success.However, I wasted my money because of one problem: the font size is undersized (six-point maximum) to be practical if one's eyesight is less than 20/20 or you're over 50-years old. I'm going back to my 1978 Pocket Oxford Dictionary rather than strain my eyes; to the devil with words younger than 28-years old. Using a magnifying glass defeats two important objectives: convenience and portability."
3,Decent for the price,"I didn't want to spend much, and it works fine for what I needed. If you will use it a lot, consider one of the more expensive slide whistles."
5,Timeless beauty,"These lovely songs include most of this UK singer/songwriter's best and most popular work, with the exclusion of some early hits from the 1960s like Lady D'Arbanville and some great album tracks like Rubylove with its Greek chorus. There are gentle, introspective tracks like Moonshadow, Peace Train and the spiritually uplifting Morning Has Broken, as well as faster, up-tempo numbers like Another Saturday Night and Can't Keep It In. The huge hit Wild World has seen many cover versions and Stevens' knack for marrying catchy tunes to poetic lyrics are in evidence throughout. Songs like Oh Very Young and Father And Son remain fresh and beautiful. Stevens may not have become one of the greatest singer/songwriters in terms of volume, but like that of Don McLean his work has stood the passage of time very well. These beautiful songs will endure."
4,GREAT SERVICE.. FAST SHIPPING,"Well ..I ordered a CD from this co it was for my mother and it came 3 days later which was awesome .. So I would recommend buying from them.., And for the price that was paid for the CD it was in very good shape.. 4 star rating.."
3,The forgotten songs ...,THE HURT and LATER are the two strongest and well sung songs of Cat Stevens(LP Foreigner-1973).Where are they in the collections CDs???? I have listened to others songs of Cat Stevens and did not found no one like this two. Incredible voice Cat Stevens put on this songs. The best two!!!!
5,Timeless,"Over the years I have encountered this compilation through relationships. I alway found myself looking through their collection to find it. I decided it was time to get my own. The music is timeless and always a croud favorite. If you don't have this for your collection, you're missing out."
5,Yusuf/Cat Stevens continues to shine out his goodness & profundity,"CD was received in good condition and in a timely manner. I loved Cat Stevens' work as a young woman, and continue to love his offerings as Yusuf. His work is not just great music with interesting words, there is profound understanding of every day life, as well as the depth of what he seeks in life and in his soul's journey to serve the planet and bring more peace through his life and work. I admire his growth and his expansive luminousity as he grows into his elder years."
2,not his greatest hits,this CD was not all his greatest hits. A few were but the majority of them I have never heard and didn't like.
2,Unpleasant Sound,"I love the music of Cat Stevens, but would not recommend this particular CD. The music seems thin, and lacks bass. The highs seem shrill. My audio system has a relaxed sound, but even so, this CD isn't one I'd put on to listen to. I find it irritating."
3,ho-hum,Had a couple of tunes that I really missed from my youth but really wasn't much to write home about. I would go for the downloads individually next time.
4,Cat Stevens Greatest Hits,"I purchased this album recently when my husband and I went on vacation. I am not a fan of radio because I can't stand the relentless chatter of the announcers so I downloaded different music on my Kindle to listen to as we were driving. My husband picked this album. When we first got together over 35 years ago we listened to music of this genre, artists like Cat Stevens, Neil Young, Peter Frampton. Listening to this music together again brought us back to our younger, carefree days."
1,cat litter box,Well this is as low as anyone can get. Not good the first time and worse now. All aboard for chessy boredom Islam style
4,Solid Brackets! Worked Well.,"Wall Bracket worked well for preconstruction and allowed for exact placement without worrying about avoiding studs later on. Drywallers should have no problem cutting these out. Used Metal shears to trim mounting straps to length, but didn't really have to. The AudioSource NCBC6 Bracket for AudioSource AS6C/AS7C/Phoenix Gold ATC6 and NCBI515 15-Inch Construction Bracket for AudioSource AS515S/Phoenix Gold ATI515 were even better."
1,"the watch had taken a licking, and was ticking, BUT....","Unfortunately, the watch had taken a licking somewhere and was still ticking, but it was impossible to set the time and date. The watch stem was broken off and the watch was running. The rubber thing that was supposed to be in place to keep the watch from starting until you removed it was in the box also. I sent it back. Packaging was sufficient, the interior box that the watch was in was not damaged. Zero return problems. Amazon had me print out a return address form, gave me options on returning it and credited my account immediately. Great service from Amazon."
4,Basic and simple,My husband likes the velcro band and basic watch for every day wear. He also likes how easily it is to push the little button to light it up at night. Nice watch.
4,nice everday watch.,"This is a pretty good watch for the price. I like it, it has a velcro closing strap so its very comfortable and the face is large and easily read."
4,Great watch!,Very light - works great - have to get another!Only con is date is not easily read or set.
3,Pretty good,"I've had good and bad experiences with this watch. The first one I had that I lost seemed to work great but I never really tested it. My second experience was fine. I used this watch for swim lessons and it seemed fine before it was left somewhere. My last one though, I've had one for between one and two years and recently water got inside it. It's rated for 50 meters so a 5 food hotel pool shouldn't test it. I've also heard there customer support isn't good. The warranty is a year. I will likely make it that far, but I wouldn't guarentee too long past that."
4,"Handy knocking around watch, strap could be better","I had a few requirements when buying this watch: indiglo (or similar night light feature), lightweight, velcro strap, and cheap. This watch meets all the requirements. I like to be able to wake up in the middle of the night and know what time it is, and this watch is perfect for that. The velcro strap makes it comfortable to sleep in, wrap on a beach bag handle, pull off quickly in a pinch, etc. etc. My one quibble with it is that the velcro is getting a little hairy and unruly. I cannot see it lasting as long as the watch itself. Still -- a minor criticism. I'd buy another one."
5,"perfect sport, swimming, everyday watch","I swim regularly in a pool, sometimes in the ocean, and I've had no problems at all with this watch for the past two months. It is perfect to wear for the gym and other activities, since it is light like a paper clip. The watch band is nylon, so it dries quickly and won't rot like leather if it gets wet. The dial lights up when you press the button so there is no trouble reading it in the dark. Also, the hands glow in the dark even without pressing the button, so that you can still read the time if both hands are busy. For this price, you can't get a more perfect sport and swimming watch.The band secures with velcro, so you get a perfect fit every time you put it on. No hassles taking out links, nor with the ""holes"" on a standard band wearing out or ripping.Note that at a rating of 50M, it is only meant for shallow swimming, not SCUBA, nor snorkeling. But it's great in the pool, and you won't find another watch that is a better deal."
2,small band,The watch is very nice but the band runs very small. So if you have a smaller wrist you will love it. I will be sending the watch back.
1,false advertised!!!,"face is plastic and scratches very easy.The watch body is not stainless steel its plastic.The band has no leather, it is plastic and velcro, and very weak, won't last long.This watch is only correct in saying it is a timex, but a poor one at that, this watch gives the Timex company a bad name and I would rather have bought a cheap dimestore watch if I would have known about this watches shabby made materials!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Would reccomend,"I will definitely recommend this product for a work watch. When mine eventually breaks, I will buy another."
3,Get what you pay for,"The watch works just fine. The window is plastic instead of glass and scratched the first day I wore it. But, it is a inexpensive watch so you get what you pay for"
1,Case broke after 1 week of normal wearing.,Broken lug after 1 week of normal wearing. The lug itself - part of the case - broke off in my sleep. No special activity... The case is not covered by the warranty. See my pictures.
3,effective but short duration of efficacy,does neutralize but on 2 occasions I found the gel to stop working after about 2 weeks.
4,Waiting for Home,"This is a painful book to read, but interesting and important. I know Richard Prangley, and his positive outlook and love of life are amazing, given the pain he's endured throughout his entire childhood. This book helps the reader to understand that it's possible to survive unspeakable horror and yet live a life full of joy and community. This book forces us to think about how we label and separate people who don't meet our standards in some way, and how we do so with what we believe to be ""good intentions."""
1,Poor product,The assembly instructions are very poor. You have to figure most of it out as you go. They don't include any lock washers either. Once I got it together it is a nice looking machine but A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY. It breaks OVER 50 percent of the birds it throws. I have adjusted the tension spring as week as I can and still throw a bird but it still breaks most of the birds. I have contacted customer service three times now but they they have made no reply. If you buy one you just better hope it works with no problems.
3,Pessimists are never disappointed....,"and perhaps I should not have had such high expectations. As is typical with imports the fit/ finish was poor- a decent paint job is not going to affect performance of a product- but at $200 welds without sharp splatter and lack of gloppy brush strokes should be included in the price. The legs are not a hard mount, but rather held in place with set screw and the design does not defy gravity- each time we moved at least one leg dropped out of the mounting point. The provided hardware was incomplete and what was there was poor in quality- as the unit is going to be subject to vibration I replaced the standard nuts (lockwashers? Heck no!) with Ny-locks. The wobble attachement is a must! Fortunatley I'm not optimistic about the longevity of the service life... perhaps I'll get a plesant surprise after all... but the odds seem against it. On a final note... oh, yeah... this thing HURLS birds!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I'm the greatest wife,I'm the greatest wife EVER! Least that's what all of my husbands friends said when he invited them over to play with his Christmas present. It was like watching a group of young boys (which they're not) with their first bb guns.
5,such a wonderful film,"Another great movie that I stumbled upon. I cannot believe that there was not more written about this one. The beautiful Neve Campbell delivers a remarkable performance and Jeremy Irons along with Cissy Spacek ensure that you will be taken on a highly interesting ride.Jeremy Irons - arguably the best living actor - truly becomes ""Scott"" in this harrowing display of creative downward spirals with momentary glimpses of genius.Instead of glorifying or overly romanticizing the subject, the director paints a picture of the subtle and not-so-subtle relationship dynamics among the characters; particularly the struggles of Fitzgerald and his lovely, devoted and talented assistant.This is one of those rare finds in the world of movies that falls under the radar but once discovered, becomes a treasure to the viewer.Very nicely done."
3,GREAT FILM - SAD TRANSFER,"I originally watched this film on Showtime during its premiere broadcast. It was shown in a letterboxed format. Unfortunately, Showtime chose to author this DVD in pan & scan.The film really loses some of its intimacy betweeen the characters, and much of the wonderful production design. What was sharp and clear in widescreen is now slightly blurred, also.Bad choice for a really wonderful film, Showtime. HBO gives us their original works with the aspect ratio intact intact, why don't you?"
3,Not the best device...,"Poor sound, to use the headphone jack you have to take the visor off the leather case, and it doesn't have a volume control !!!"
1,Lackluster audio quality,"CD-quality sound I wasn't expecting for 69.95, still I was dismayed by the scratchy low-fi audio produced by the my-Vox. One possible explanation would be the extreme compression scheme required by the small onboard memory size. Tiny memory equals tinny sound, I guess.Needless to say, I returned mine."
5,Childhood of Famous Americans,This is a very readable series for elmentary and even junior high students. The people come alive so that the students relate to a person and not just a name in a history book.
5,Smart Ben,I thought that it was a good book because I like biographies. I especially liked the part when he went to the Latin School and he couldn't say the poem because the school master gave Ben the wrong poem. I recommend this book to you if you like to read biographies. I also recommend this book if you think that a president's life would be interesting.
4,ok for the price,"$1.02 (+$6.49 shipping & handling)had to take a star off because there is no on/off switch and the point that goes into the cig outlet does not have a springvery small size and quietI only got one to test out, got it running two 4.8 watt LED light strings, so I'll see how long it holds up."
3,Intermittent on/off - otherwise good,"I agree with Matt. It works OK and saves you when one of your electrical devices is on the verge of the battery dying. The problem is that in some cars (we tested in all 3 of ours, and they all acted different) the device looses its connection. When you wiggle it around, that usually comes back, but it is annoying."
1,Scam! is a racist scam against Travellers,"In addition to being incredibly poorly written, this book is misleading and racist. The Travelling people have been living in the traditional way for centuries in Ireland and yes, some have made their way to the States. Obviously, there are good and bad in every culture, but it seems that the writer of this book is trying to blame Travellers for every major scam in America. This is ridiculous. It is also insulting to the majority of the Travellers, who are law-abiding, respectable citizens who mind their own business. The book was obviously written with the explicit purpose of slanderizing the Irish Travellers, which is a shame. If the writer had done more research, as opposed to just cranking out a sensationalist tabloid essay, he would have found that a small minority of scams are carried out by Travellers, however, Travellers often get blamed for scams that they have no responsibility for ."
5,The BEST Bad Movie EVER from Harold Robbins (and Pia!),"This one ranks among the Top 10 Best Bad Movies of All Time in my new book, THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE MOVIE GUIDE <ASIN: 0446693340>(also available from amazon.com). Financed by Pia's billionaire husband Meshulem Riklis, based on Harold Robbins' delectably trashy novel and centered on Zadora's portrayal of a struggling screenwriter who's used and abused by just about everyone in Hollywood, LONELY LADY must be seen to be disbelieived. Featuring a rape-by-garden-hose, a scene where a billiard ball is shot at Pia's privates as she cavorts nude atop a pool table, a lesbian hot-tub seduction, Zadora in one of the greatest Going-Insane-Before-Our-Eyes scenes of all time and the funniest/tackiest award show acceptance speech ever filmed, this is a MUST SEE for anyone who truly loves Bad Cinema at Its BERRY Worst!"
3,From Back Cover,"Clint Andover's opinion of nurse Tara Roberts was that she was trouble with a capital T. When she began receiving threatening letters, Clint was determined to protect Tara, but she defied his commands, ignored his warnings, set his blood boiling and his body yearning. Tara was all about responsibility and independence - she didn't let anyone get too close to her. What was a tough Texan cowboy to do? Well, bunking out on Tara's couch was a start - the sexy lady's bed was an ever better idea. But while he was locked up with Tara in her cozy home, would she find the key to his guarded heart?2nd in The Texas Cattleman's Club: The Stolen Baby series"
2,ho hum,"For queer movie officionados this movie is worth a view, not overly memorable but light watchable viewing."
2,Not much happens,"Eh....nothing much happens in this movie. Half of the 70 minutes is filled with useless side stories that add very little to the main storyline...which I assume was the relationship between the two coworkers. The side stories really don't add much, a bit of fluff here and there. The flimsy main storyline is weakly supported by bits of interactions between the coworkers and conversations with other people. I wish there was a bit more of a connection. Are they mere coworkers or friends as well?A bit boring, but I had a few chuckles here and there. The acting is not bad but the story goes nowhere. Status quo is the norm, and the goal, in this movie."
3,"Great Video, not long enough.","This video does an excellent job of showing what it takes to become a United States Pararescueman, arguably one of the most difficult jobs in the world. The video also gives a little bit of the history of Pararescue, from the first rescue in World War II in Burma, through the real growth of Combat Rescue in Vietnam, through a few modern day rescues. My problem with this video is that it is not long enough to really show everything of interest about Pararescue. It only briefly touches the history, the training, and the lives of these American heroes.I still recommend this video, but keep in mind that there is much, much more to Pararescue than this video shows. I would like to see a re-release, but I know the probability of this happening is very low. I know that my father was interviewed for almost an hour, and yet the video showed about 30 seconds of his interview."
3,Very loud motor,"I liked the form factor and power supply that came with this camcorder. It would be very easy to bring on a trip. The fatal flaw in my opinion however is the motor noise. It's extremely loud and the built in microphone picks it all up and records it on tape. I've owned other mini dv camcorders in the past that did not have this problem. (Canon Optura Pi, Canon ZR40)."
5,No motor noise at all on my unit!,"Read some of the reviews concerning motor noise recording onto the tape. Put the camcorder on my table in record mode and was totally silent---played back tape at loud volume and could only hear my refrigerator running, no camera motor noise at all! Overall a fantastic camera for the price. To copy movie to your computer you must connect the audio cable portion of the supplied wire harness to the"
2,Excess Sound? Is this right?,"When I got the camera, I immediately noticed the small size. That along with the CCD were pluses, but as soon as I turned on the camera for recording, that's when the problems started. First of all, please, somebody tell me if this is correct or if I should return it for an exchange (mine may be faulty):The winding noise from the DV tape is captured onto all films recorded. This means that there is a constant train like noise captured onto all of the videos I record from this camcorder. I'm thinking that the manufacturer's can't be that stupid to make such a faulty mistake, so I'm gonna try to exchange this for another one. Is there any hope in doing this, or does all JVC GR-D230's have this problem?I also didn't like the need to install their proprietary software.Please, people who have this camera, tell me if this is a common mistake that you have to live with, or is this just a faulty item they shipped. Thanks"
1,Don't buy this camcorder,"I bought this camcorder in 12/04 and I had to take it for service 4 times already. The screen was too dark and when I record, it show in slow motion.The worse camcorder I ever bought bought not to mention the service I received. I take it for service, 2 weeks later I pick it up only to find out I still have the same problemDon't waste your money."
3,Decent camera but not great,"I was most impressed by the stabilization of the camera at 10x but the quality of the image wasn't that great. You really do need to use the manual mode instead of the automatic. Scenes are often under or over exposed. They are also very orange or blue so you'll need to white balance each scene. It's good that you can change both things but it would be better if it's more automatic. The markings on the side (play, record, automatic, manual) started to rub off after just 10 days. The size is great (fits in your palm). The manual is quite confusing."
1,"Doesn't sound right, a defective one again?","It seems mine was previously returned. All bags are open. Little scratch on the body. The biggest problem is the grinding noice, like a train passing by.JVC is getting really low now.Continue with my review. Since the background noise is really bad, I tried out the external microphone. But the mic socket is defective. Using their micphone extension cable to connect to a computer microphone, there's no sound recorded. Finally I found out the mic plug has to stay half-way into the socket to get sound input. This is really annoying - how can a brand new camcorder have a defective microphone socket.I have never seen a malfunctioning mic socket before!"
3,The first feeling when I get this MiniDV,"Just got the MiniDV from Amazon. Ordered it on Nov.6 at Amazon and received it on Nov.9 night. $329 (AR) is a reasonable price, but should not be a Hot deal. I bought this in hurry because the coming thanksgiving holiday. The first glance of this Mini Camcorder is not so exciting, because it looks not so smooth and fine like Sony's product. Attached Battery is BNV408 and can only last 1.3 hrs; 8M SD card and no cassette, that means you MUST and HAVE TO invest extra $100 on case, BNV428 battery, 64M SD card and some cassettes to let this tiny camcorder work in a reasonable good shape. The remote control is cute! Just my personal opinion for your reference. Not operate it since I am charging the Battery now..@_@ Anyway, not too bad if you want to have this camcorder for your vacation."
1,misleading ad,"I bought this item because I understood that was made of bone material, related in its description. But it is plastic!! For a international purchase, it was an deception with unnecessary costs."
5,New version released with correct tracks,"As the other reviewer wrote if the cd had been correct it would be a 5 star, as ""Remember"" is one of Buddy Holly most sought after lp's. I also bought the first version of the cd which has a number of incorrect tracks; I contacted BGO, and the new release is equal to the original lp's. BGO even sent me a free copy of the new release. Conclusion: this cd is an absolute-must-buy for Holly fans, but beware that you get the newly released version"
2,lacks fire ( and brimstone),"As a casual bluegrass listener, I'm a little disappointed. There's not much on this CD that's memorable. From an earlier album Blue Highway had a track called ""The Seventh Angel"" about the events of Revelation 10.Bluegrass and Revelation...what a combo.On this CD though, the music is sort of flat,nothing that will grab you.""The Old Rugged Cross"" sounds like a good track to play for the offertory hymn at Ebenezer Baptist next Sunday, otherwise that's it."
4,pretty nice for the price,"Very comfortableand easy to inflate. Does lose some air at night,but that's to be expected. Foot pump is nice option to make mattress more firm. Only bad thing is that there is no storage bag."
1,I got a lemon,"bought this a year ago, never opened it until recently and it leaks air too badly to use. Foot pump does not work either."
2,Two stars because no battery powered pump,"The pump is a manual hand pump, that relies on a valve in the mattress. You just sort of push it down and pull it up to bring more air in. This would get a few more stars, but the description lists a battery powered pump (4 x D batteries) and none came with the package at all.I noticed that quite a few other people reviewing this pointed out the lack of the battery powered pump. Either I'm missing it or the description is wrong. Either way, that's annoying."
1,i want to contact the seller,When i originally looked at this product there was a video that showed a man taking the air mattress with 4D batteries and an internal pump outdoors and turning a switch where the whole mattress filled up in a couple minutes. Fantastic! and the pump was so small. I thought this would be perfect for my upcoming camping trip. i bought the batteries and out i went with the mattress still in the box. When i arrived and removed the mattress from the package there was no mechanical battery driven pump at all. After a short attempt to blow up the mattress i gave up. Now i can't contact the seller. i want to return this product for the one i saw on the video.
2,Manual pump - not automatic/battery-powered,"The reviews and photos for this item are misleading. It has a built-in hand/foot pump, not an automatic/battery powered pump.I ordered it and had to return.A lot of people probably make this mistake because the Amazon promo link under it says ""Customers buy this item with Energizer D-Cell 4-Pack $12.47"". Several reviews here are also incorrect and say that they used it with D batteries.There are many similar air beds on here with built-in pumps that use D batteries, so watch out for this. The description here actually doesn't say that it uses batteries, whereas the other ones do.It's probably not right to leave 2 stars based on the quality of the product, which seems fine, but it's not what I wanted."
2,Quality,"Although the air bed is comfortable, it will not hold air thru the night!also beware of 3rd party sales on this site!"
1,don't buy unless you want to fill it every two hours,"The first one I bought sprung a leak on the second usage simply by deflating it and rolling it up. Back it went. The second one gotten in the return has done the same thing, starting on the second usage and springing a leak with every roll up--I don't even roll it up any more due to this and it still springs leaks in the sidewalls constantly. I have never been more frustrated with an air mattress. Lost the original receipt so I have lost my $45. Don't buy this one. While the battery option is great and it fits in my van great, my eddie bauer one has never sprung a leak."
3,Comfortable,The bed inflates and deflates easily. I couldn't seem to get the side furthest from the pump as firm as I would have liked but I did sleep well on it. I bought it for my son's apartment for when we would be visiting him and spending the night. The sheets fit well too.
1,It only has a manual pump,This bed does NOT have an automatic pump. It is a self-contained FOOT PUMP. The description is not at all accurate.
1,It sucks because I have not received the book so far,"It would be nice to receive the book if you pay for it, right?You guys suck."
4,a complete story of the railroad that lived on the per diem,"The Interstate Railroad is a complete history of a short line Appalachian coal hauler. Packed with pictures and easy to understand text, the book features complete car rosters and locomotive information. Of particular interest are the interviews with former employees and pictures of the towns that the railroad served. Steve Morris"
2,Difficult and boring,"Cute idea from the original Giga pets, but these newer ones are a pain in the butt to take care of. You cannot feed or take care of your pet until you have enough money to buy food or the supplies it needs, and digging for the right amount of money takes hours. It's been awhile since I've used this, but I don't recall the instructions being too detailed, and I was confused on what I should 'do'. I don't remember there being a goal with these pets like there is with original Giga Pets and tamagotchis (I.E. growing up, changing). The Tomcat will always be a tomcat...digging for lost treasure. Very boring. I did not buy this from amazon (or seller)"
4,What there is to like about this book...,What there is to like about this book: The title. Feeling better about yourself. Feeling better about somebody else. Exuberance.
5,Wonderful part of Louisiana History,"I read this book aloud to my children when we were studying Louisiana History. It is written using Cajun dialect in the dialog which if you are not from the area (or have someone who is to help) might pose a difficulty. It is about a young girl befriending an Indian girl in the Bayou Barataria area. The story tells how the Indian girl works her way into the family and makes a place for herself. It shows how the people made a living on the bayou fishing, hunting, and trapping. It gives a wonderful depiction of how they celebrated holidays and lived out daily life. It shows the unique Cajun culture in a day when being called a cajun was an insult. I feel that it is a wonderful addition to any study on Louisiana."
3,Get it for free instead!,"This is available for free on the Internet -- a quick and simple web search will get you the address. I believe print copies are available from his monastery as well. A lot could be said one way or another by various people depending on their preferences for this writer's translations as well as intellectual style. I leave those issues to you. Just don't pay anything for a copy of this book.And I would really perrsonally recommend anything by Ajahn Chah, Ajahn Brahm, and Ajahn Sumedho for wonderful insights into the ideas of the Thai Forest Tradition."
2,Bratz-be-gone,"The is Bratz CD player doesn't even look like a handbag. It's poorly constructed and once the girls tried to use it, the cd player cover wouldn't stay shut. Poor sound quality and poor reception on the radio. Very disappointed in this product."
4,A lot of cumin with a chili finish,"A nice, bright orange spice mix that has a strong cumin start with a nice chili finish. The chili flavor is a nice blend without one chili overpowering the others. I couldn't taste the ajwan or cardamom, and suspect that they were hidden by the chili. It goes well with meat. I have been using it blended with other spice mixes to add some cumin and chili flavor.Ingredient list: Cumin, paprika, new mexico chili peppers, cayenne pepper, de arbol chili peppers, nutmeg, ancho chili peppers, ajwan seeds, cardamom, turmeric, garlic, salt, and other spices"
2,A spicy little shell game!,"This Zamouri berbere spice that i received did NOT have the same list of ingredients that are listed here for their Berbere. It contains no chili peppers even though Berbere should contain five (5) different peppers; but unfortunately this mix DOES contain BOTH cumin AND tumeric.Most ardent Ethiopian foodies know NOT to include tumeric with the cumin in Berbere spice. They are not used together in the same dish. Ethiopian dishes are made with one or the other, but not both. Also. the ingredients were listed in a completely different sequence, which changes the taste considerably, not to mention how much the lack of chili peppers changes the balance, keeping it way too bland, and without any heat.Fortunately, i live in Los Angeles where there is an Ethiopian section of town where injera and classic berbere can be purchased. I ordered a lot of Moroccan spices from Zamouri, and added the berbere just to try a new product."
3,"It's not Berbere, It's curry. Delicious Curry, but still","It's not Berbere, it's curry. If only my roommates were Indian, instead of Ethiopian, they would be so happy when they came home today. Don't get me wrong, it is Delicious Curry-- it's just not berbere."
2,Narrow minded,"This DVD is to narrow minded. Is doensn't give an honest account of the time being. It's like explaining George W. Bush account on Cuba, but not mentioning on 9/11.An amusing DVD, but not a must see...."
3,MACHIAVELLIAN MACHINATIONS?,"THE TRIALS OF HENRY KISSINGER (First Run Features) asks if the former Secretary of State is guilty of crimes against humanity. Consider the Machiavellian machinations of power and ego in this fascinating and provocative documentary that gleefully attacks the pomposity of an arrogant political icon.I like anything that humbles the proud, but felt this BBC production actually held back a bit and perhaps even wimped out when it came to outright accusations. Still, it's definitley worth seeing, especially if you ignorantly hold this man in high esteem."
2,No Trial here. Not for regular tubes.,"This DVD is not title safe , yes this matters in a documentary because if you play this on your regular tube you will be short about 15-20% of the full image and will feel extremely close to some of the interviewed, not to mention some of the names will be cut off. Good Interviews even though it seems alot had been omitted and edited to be very one sided. No trial here only prosecuter's notes. should have been called ""The Crimes of HK"" for there's no trial here. Great Introduction on the Timor situation, here is your 1 star. good doc , another star. bad dvd though."
5,DUBROOM.com Review,"When George W. Bush wanted to appoint Henry Kissinger as chairman of the 911 Whitewash comittee, a lot of people stood up and protested over this blatant and arrogant choice of the elite.After all, Henry Kissinger is the kind of guy who has to check out with his lawyers before he enters a certain country, because there are so many charges against him all over the world.For those who wonder why, this movie could answer a lot of your questions. You will see what Henry Kissinger has done over the years, his involvement in world politics and the games he played behind the scene."
1,so sorry I wasted my money... I'll save it next time!,"I really hate books and series like this one. I mean, overaged writers trying to make us believe that they really know what's going on in our heads, when they obviously do not- at all. Please save your ink, Ms. Bryant, until you have come up with a good and realistic novel. And as for the chracters, they are all goody-goodies, and I wouldn't ever like to be associated with them."
5,Thanks so much!!!,"Thanks so much for coming up with this new series!! It always bothered me that characters in books (Babysitters Club: How long have they been 13?) NEVER grow up. It's a fact of life and should happen eventually. It is also refreshing to see a series that's not horror or only romance. Like others on here, I read the Saddle Club even after I outgrew them!! I haven't read the first book yet, but am anxiouslly awaiting it. Today is Monday and it said that it was coming out today, but I went two places annd neither had it yet. Guess I'll wait a little longer =) Thanks Ms. Bryant!!! Becky"
1,HOW COULD THEY!!!!!????,"What happened to the saddle club? The rules were must love horses and must help each other! They broke both these rules many times in this book? In the saddle club, it seemed like Carole, Stevie and Lisa were my best friends, in this book it seemed like they were my worst ememys! Who wrote this book? not Bonnie Bryant! I just know that after 111 touching, exciting, funny horsey books she couldn't just throw it all away! What happened? It's like a nightmare! I've been reading the saddle club for years, and this is about totally different people. No one could go from a wonderful person to the most terrible person in the world in a few years? Lisa dating Alex? Veronica married? Stevie giving up practical jokes? Carole selling Starlight? I THINK NOT!! A trillion thumbs down!!"
5,Hurray!!!!!!,This book is great!!! I love the saddle club books and that's how I know I'll love the pine hollow books too!! I think that the pine hollow books are much more realistic and more mature. I was worried that I'd outgrown the saddle club books and have nothing good to read! Thanks a lot Bonnie Bryant! Keep up the good work!
3,Hmmmm.....,"From the Pine Hollow 1-3, sounds like most of you don't like these new series. My parents have been pushing me to read more ""mature"" books. Here's my chance. I'll check it out anyway. If these girls are around 16, Maxi must be 3 or 4 ( I bet she'll be adorable) Veronica not riding anymore??? With Mommy and Daddy to spoil her, come on why would they sell Danny, world's perfect horse? I kinda expect to have these series to out of this world, like Carole becomes an Olymician, Stevie and Belle in Grand Prix or even Lisa riding in an cross country compeition. Next time Ms. Bryant, you create a new Saddle Club series, be sure the next one would like like I said adove, like the Silver Blades Olymnic dreams."
4,"ok, but what about the others?","Bonnie Bryant has been a fav. author of mine for a long time. I've always enjoyed the other charactors even Veronica! Why didn't she( bonnie bryant) include the others like Veronica, or Maxi? I also did'nt like the fact that Lisa's parents got divorced. I mean it happens, but Lisa's family had always seem so perfect. I gave the book 4 stars, and I 'd like to give it 5 but the book just didn't make it. Maybe next book! I will remain loyal to Bonnie. If you agree with me e-mail me!"
4,Pretty Good,"This book was pretty good, but didn't have enough about horses! The car accident was discribed very well. And I hope that Ms. Bryant talks more about the people at Bar None, Belle, and Phil, because they all seemed to be some of my favorite characters, but were left out in this books. That is why I only gave this book 4 stars. I was suprised that Stevie would go get a job right after she got her drivers license. I would have thought she would have waited, but I was never able to perdict the things she would do in the Saddle Club books, so I probably won't in the Pine Hollow books either! I hope that Bonnie Bryant continue this series, but brings back some of the old characters. I have just finish reading Pine Hollow 11, Ground Training, and would highly recomend the rest of the series."
5,"Real people, real problems...","I think this seris is a WAYYYY better than the Saddle Club.They're adults and they're treated like it while facing teenager's problems like drinking and driving and cheating on tests and still have time to spend with their horses. Not everything works out in the way they want, and that's what I like about it...it's not like when they were young and everything ended up good for them, no matter how much trouble they were in. I think this seris is very good if you want real people with real problems that you can relate to."
4,"Suspenseful, Spiritual","Just read this book almost straight through.It grabs you from the begining and keeps you interested. It centers around 2 priests who go undercover to help support the underground catholic believers in the USSR. The struggles of the heroes, internal and external, paint a somewhat realistic picture of the Roman church, European political philosophies, and the people of Communist Russia during the 1930s. The characters are complex and the story is rivetting."
5,False Holiness Expose by Dr. Bob Hellmann,It is an awesome research thru biblical facts that created an electrifying result on religious practices. Recommended reading to all christians that are in search of truth. Dr. Hellmann has opened a new door to bring us closser to truth.
2,It doesn't have hangers so I can hang it to the wall,I returned because I thougth it has the option to hang in the wall like the NETGEAR products.
1,Terrible throughput,"Apparently some have success with this unit and some don't. I bought the V3 unit and put the 2.50.2 firmware on it and 50k is the best download speed I can get. Spent time on the phone with LinkSys and they said take it back. Weird thing is, my upload speed is over 200k, about what it should be."
3,Tough Install,"Unless you have the simplest of hardware configurations, this product is going to be difficult to install. I had to return one defective product, download the correct firmware version for the second one, and reprogram parts of the router to work with my odd hardware configurations. Linksys customer service was clueless and very rude. Total install time was probably greater than 10 hours. On the positive side, the product does appear to give good protection from outside intrusion, and Amazon was fabulous about accepting my defective product and getting me a new one in a timely manner."
2,"Easy to set up, but unreliable and limited lifespan","I got this router two years ago and used it to share my DSL connection among my computers. Setting it up was very easy. I did get disconnected once or twice a week, but I never investigated if it was the router or my DSL provider who dropped the connection. Now it's been two years and the dreaded Diag light went solid red the other day. I contacted Linksys tech support through on-line chat from their web site and got a quick response. Unfortunatly they told me the router is broken and there is nothing they can do. Easy installation, low price, good tech support, but possibly dropped connections and limited lifespan -- that comes out at two stars in my book."
5,Router,Very good router. It was up and running in just a few minutes. I have always trusted the Brand Linksys. I would highly suggest this model to anyone looking for a router.
3,You could do better,"I owned this unit for about 2 years and it worked but as mentioned in some of the other reviews it locks up every so often. Because there is no reset button easy to access (there is a tiny recessed button on on the back) we ended-up unplugging the unit a lot. Eventually the power connection became flakey and the unit began powering down randomly. The software is also not that nice--they released few new features in the firmware and a few releases back they tried to add firewall capability that they yanked out in the next release, never to return.I replaced it with the SMC Barricade 8 Port 10/100 Mbps Broadband Router which is a superior product (see my review for brief comparison)."
5,Linksys Router review,Received sooner than anticipated. Easy hookup and eliminated probelm we were having with other router/switch hookup. Recommend to anyone looking to connect multiple pcs/laptops to cable connection.
2,Won't go the distance,"I bought this router about a year ago. It looks nice and sets up easily and would be a strong recommend--if it would continue working properly.After only a few months, I started noticing the occasional internet access outage. Never even really thought about it. Then it grew progressively worse, up to 15 or 20 times a day. Not being a network guru, it's taken quite a bit of time and effort to trace the problem back to the router. Linksys tech support didn't even answer my emails (and phone support is now a 900 number).Don't buy this product unless you hate yourself and enjoy having your internet access fail whenever you seem to need it most."
2,Early death,"This router functioned normally, then died after less than 3 years in service. I expected it to last longer."
2,router ok,"This router is a fine, useable piece of electronic equipment. It is completely obsolete by today's standards, but if all you need is a primitive piece of equipment, it does fine."
4,Worth the money.. has some ipsec/vpn issues,"I bought one of these for my home network. My house is wired with cat5e and I have att broadband cable.The unit setup quickly and the NAT stuff worked great. It took me literally 10 minutes to have it all working.The trouble is with my companies vpn software (cisco). The 8 port unit has some fragmentation issue that causes some problems so I have to disable ipsec through NAT. (this is fixed in the 4 port version). Additionally, this unit only supports one active ipsec session, so I can only have one machine connected to the office at a time. :("
2,wish I'd looked here before buying mine...,"I bought mine at a local Micro Center. I wish I'd looked here first. The Linksys was easy to set up and would probably work fine for 99 percent of people. I also like the fact that this is not an 802.11b base station. I prefer to have the security option of unplugging the wireless base station and therefore it needs to be a separate physical box.What about those 1 percent of users who won't like this product? If you like to keep TCP connections open for a long time, e.g., if you're a developer using ssh or telnet, this Linksys is problematic. My old SMC router, after upgrading the firmware, was rock solid and I could keep an Emacs up and running on a remote server for days or weeks. With the Linksys connections will mysteriously die. I haven't changed my cable modem or my cable service."
3,"Great Product, Abyssmal Support","Product Rating: 5Support Rating: 1 (just because i couldn't rate it lower)Trying to reach support is a waste of time and when you do, all they will tell you to do is take the linksys box out of your network and hard connect to your cable modem... There are known problems in the user community that their technical support will not fess up to.It is sad because this is a stellar product."
1,Don't Upgrade Firmware,"Router worked fine until I had to upgrade. Followed instructions, yet upgrade did not take. Worse yet, it is no longer usable. Linksys tech support won't do anything for you even though their firmware upgrade rendered the device useless."
2,Linksys BEFSR81 Cable/dsl Router with 8-PT Switch,"Nice router, once I got it working. Instructions would not allow me to go past the software trying to find the router. Fortunately, I am experienced in Linksys routers and knew the IP address and password (there was no printed instructions) and configured the router without the buggy software."
3,Great initially - flaky after a year,"I've had this router installed in our home network for almost a year. It installed quickly and easily and performed flawlessly for nearly a year.However, recently we'd started to experience frequent connection drops to the Internet. Down for 3-5 minutes, then back up, several times an hour. Network troubleshooting pointed to the router, and after reading some of the comments here and other places, I replaced the Linksys with an SMC Barricade. Our connection has been solid ever since.Most of the components in our home network are Linksys products, and they've always installed easily and worked great. It does worry me though that they too might have a limited lifespan."
4,Linksys BEFSR81,A Good buy. Very user friendly and works trouble-free so far. The only negative is the unit should have wall mount capability.
3,Cable Router,The speed in delivery and proper packing was offset by the sender not packing the setup CD with the router. I lost four weeks waiting for Cisco to ship the CD to me.
2,Worked great until it failed,"My experience is exactly the same as another reviewer, Mark. My router was flawlessly serving 5 home-networked computers for six months. It was easy to set up and never once showed any signs that it was on it's way out. The router was attached to a Linksys Cable Modem and a Linksys 5-port hub was connected to one of the router ports in my home office. I had the exact same experience as Mark did when contacting Linksys help.I would give the router 5 stars for it's performance, but being it crashed after six months, not so good tech support and their terrible RMA process, I knocked it down to 2 stars.I wonder about my Linksys cable modem and hub...."
4,Problems but quick response for resolution,1st order was a bad unit - company quickly re-shipped and corrected the issue.Lessons learned - more complete communications needed - Nice recovery
5,Fantastic customer service!,"Needed to replace a manufacturer-discontinued switch in a hurry. Ordered Linksys switch Saturday afternoon - Get More, PAY LESS shipped it so that I received it Monday morning. Fantastic customer service!"
2,OH...I'm shaking in my shoes! NOT!,"This book is not even scary! On the back of the book... scare the toughest buff? Yeah right! I'm 11 years old and it didn't even scare me for a sec! God, I can write scarier stories than him! I am very dissapointed! Thank god I didn't buy this book, I got it out of the school library! The reason why I gave it 2 stars is because of the creativity and how he writes...good wording, or whatever. I don't reccomend this book at all! Just a waste of time!"
4,It's Ahmad...,"Well, if you are not a jazz fan, stop reading...For you jazz lovers, this album is a taste of the creation of the modern trio. Although back then trio's were not always b/d/p, this is a classic trio. Ahmad has inspired monsters such as Jarrett and Mehldau, with his classic, smooth playing. This album sounds really old, but the classics never get old to me..."
4,"ahmad jamal, a winner.","tasteful, playful & bouncy is how i would describe this piano trio recording. anything recorded by ahmad jamal in the 50's or early 60's is worth owning. i rank him up there with my favortie jazz pianists, including, of course, bill evans and thelonius monk. great sunday afternoon or early evening listening is the pigeonhole i place this album in at home. enjoyable beginning to end."
3,A Herbie Hancock disco/funk production,"Rather than use funk/r&b as a springboard for inspired solos as he did in the mid-70's, here HH seems intent on mining trendy pop-oriented elements for their own sake, and leaving his jazz talents on the shelf. Those expecting keyboard solos from Herbie will find them few and far between in the process to appeal to dance-oriented pop music fans. I admit the track READY OR NOT comes close to working up a Funkadelic-like sweat, and several other cuts are pretty good for the genre it represents, though not for Herbie's keyboard talents. Yet overall the album has (intentionally?) little aesthetic value, and is further marred by Hancock's reliance on a vocoder for singing (better to be used in smaller doses). In all, those looking for jazz won't find it here, even in a fused state, and those looking for a dance record that moves the mind as well as the feet at best only get the latter with this album."
3,Good as far as it goes,"Pretty, superficial treatment. I agree with another reviewer's question about why purple drawings on a light purple background? It's amazing and sad how many of the spacecraft detailed have already been cancelled or deferred."
3,It's an Okay One,"The selection of pieces is nice, however I'm not much of a Bach fan. If you like any of the pieces included in the book you should get it because it's a pretty good deal rather than buying any one of them seperate.The book is bound pourly and may fall apart."
5,awesome,"this toy is awesome because you can do cool tricks and its fun. i got mine 4 my b-day, once i opened it i totally exploded. on a 5 star 4 fun u should get it"
3,FUN,"I love this toy but the first day I got it, it worked fine. The second day was a different story (It got trown softly) and stuck in a tree I finally got it down and oh my gosh it wouldn't flie at all. It was flat. We couln't find the hole so I just had to throw it away not to mention the $12 . I would not recomand this. Unless you want to throw away 2 things $12 and a great toy."
4,This is a disposable toy!!!!,"While my son absolutely loved playing with this toy for about 1 or 2 hours, it is truly a ""disposable"" item. After about an hour of play, the thing totally gave out. It is made out of mylar so I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be durable. (...) If you are watching your pocketbook, I would say to pass. This is a great concept, they just need to figure out how to make it with something more durable!"
1,Too fragile to play with,"This ripped almost immediately. Too bad, it is a good concept but an overall disappointment. Not recommended."
2,OOPS!,This toy is not very durable at all. The kids got to play with it about an hour before a hole was torn into it.
1,Hover Disc broke within 15 minutes of use,My nephew took his hover disc out to play and it broke within 15 minutes of use. It took me longer to order it then that. A total waste of money.
2,Waste of time,It was fun the first day and that was it. It ripped so easily that it wasn't worth the money.
3,Mother of a three year old,"DON'T BUY IT! First of all, ours had a hole in it upon taking it out of the package. The material is the same as a mylar balloon, not durable at all for outside use. I was a bit surprised to read the instructions which state how to repair it with tape!In order for it to ""hover"", it needs to be filled with helium, when filled with air it's like a big frisbee. Overall, we spent more time repairing the holes in it over and over again than playing with it. Not worth the money."
1,Disappointing,"I really thought there would be more to this book. The author has a lot of good ideas about how to kill someone and then hide the body, but I find more information on TV. It really has given me anything I really did not know. You get the feeling the author used to be involved in the mafia or something, but I don't even think he was that sophisticated. All in all, I'll say this book lacked depth and disappointed. Perhaps I was seduced by the title -- after all, how many books of this type are there -- but that was it."
1,IMPOSSIBLE,"Caring for your own dead is a nice idea, but too hard for most people. Yes, you can make your own arrangements, but actually caring for the dead takes education and skill, especially dealing with a decomposing body."
5,A mish-mash of ideas bouncing between to very talented guys,"When this album originally came out (approx. '82), the pop guitar scene was slowly being dominated by big-haired posers who claimed to be huge jazz fans. In fact, I think we were supposed to worship them because they could (or said they could) play in the myxolydian mode! Well, Fripp & Summers' little colaboration still proves that true talent and craft will outlive and endure. Basically, it's two guys improvising & building on whatever musical ideas pop into thier heads. To me, it is true improvisation at it's finest. It's also a display of using the new technology of time in a tastefull manner. Truly using a Roland Guitar Synthesizer as an INSTRUMENT, not a novelty (even though I think that they are passe today). This recording will endure! I highly recomend this one to guitar players serious about music! My favourite tune is the little duet Painting & Dance (I believe it's titled)."
4,Old Friend,"I had this album on vinyl and could never get it on CD until I decided to track it down overseas (I live in Aust). Beautiful, unusual music, created by two people who know their instruments well. It's almost 30 years old, and some ""experimental"" music of the time has not aged well, but this has. Better than their other collaboration, ""Bewitched"", which was patchy by comparison"
3,not enough for this two great composers,"I'm sorry, but I don't agree with the above commentary. This record is in my opinion just a ""self intelectual"" work, which could probably be acceptable to Fripp, but surely will be forgoten in the history of innovative or progessive music. If you can hear it from the beggining to the end probably you'll feel like you have just take a knap...I fairly recommend ""Bewitched"" which is much better than ""I advanced masked"". Exceptional composers, but I think we deserve more from them. Eugenio"
3,We learn Fripp is a fast lead and Summers a 2nd banana,"I wanted to like this a lot; I was a fripp fan and really liked summers colorations on police tracks. I drove 250 miles to get to a League of Gentleman show. But this release wasn't very compelling, and all I learned was that these guys both needed band structure - fripp, to contain his ego, and summers to cover his shortcomings. Bob blows andy away here, reducing him to more or less modest colored fills, with no structure at all. It's interesting, in a frippy way, for fans of either or both, but not really satisfying. I've bothered to listen to it maybe 4 times in the time since its original release. Unlike ""under heavy manners"", which is still a hoot nearly 20 years later."
4,Quality material and slim -- but almost too slim,"I previously had a super thick employer-provided messenger bag for my laptop, which was just unwieldy. So I was in the market for a slimmer version. This one seemed to work and was reasonably priced. I do like it, but realistically don't expect to comfortably fit anything besides a laptop in there. Oftentimes simply adding my lunch causes it to look overstuffed. Overall though I think it's a solid bag."
5,WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS STORIES!,"I especially love ""Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey."" This one will make you cry, though. There's nothing better for the family at the holidays than these wonderful Christmas stories!"
5,The Year Without A Santa Claus,"Fantastic! The antics of the Misers, especially Mr. Green Christmas (Heat Miser) is a must have. As I get older, this remains my favorite (and I'm in my mid 30's.) The Misers are pushing 30 themselves; they have aged well and are appropriate for all ages."
3,Will Year Without Santa Clause Blu Ray Just be same old copy,"I have to agree with some of the reviewers here,I love this movie but i have a feeling that Warner Brothers is going to just rewrap the old dvd and call it blu ray.Blu ray was suppose to be for adding much more stuff because it can with the amount of space on it thats availible.But remember blu ray was suppose to be the ultimate in high definition in either movies or animation,but how can you hi def something that was never filmed in high def to begin with,the answer you cant."
1,Not Worth The Money!,Just picked this up in blueray I really did not see a big difference between the dvd & blu-rayIt looked about the same.I have the older dvd version had cooler looking menus & a auto start feature.I think its a waste of money.No restoring was done on this feature.Seems a lot of these studios are just out to make a buck.
1,still waiting,"i have not received this yet its been almost a month and im getting angry.i cant figure out how to let amazon know that it hasn't come yet please, somebody tell me"
1,STINKS!!,"This totally STINKS!! I remember this from a kid.. AND THIS IS NOT IT!! I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED!! DON""T EVEN BOTHER BUYING IT!!"
5,DVD Year Without a Santa Claus Movie,"This is my daughter's favorite Christmas video. I haven't watched it yet since I gave it to her as a Christmas present, but I'm sure it's fine and she will enjoy sharing it with her son for many years to come. Thanks."
3,Would not buy... because of Nestor...!,"I was looking for A year without Santa clause, I remember it from my childhood, and have seen Rudolph's Shiny New Year, but I just watched the Nestor cartoon last night, or should I say started to watch.... My husband and I were both disturbed by it and did not want to continue watching it. We don't have any kids yet, but when I do I will not let them watch that!.... That it the reason I didn't buy this particular collection. I gave this set 3 stars because of the other two shows being wonderful but Nestor brought down the average because it was too upsetting."
3,Keeping the spirit alive!!!,"Let me first say that i do not own this DVD, YET.I have seen this movie many times, on cable. It is my favorite (Christmas) movie.I only gave it three stars because i just have seen this movie, i do not own this DVD.I will give it a better review, when i get it during Christmas time."
5,Wow!,"Shirley Booth is great, The miser brothers rock, and Vixen is lovable. Highly recommend this fantasy for children of all ages. The Rankin Bass (Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer people) have made a great classic that is always fun to revisit."
1,my disc only worked once,"I have only used this disc once and is not working anymore! I tried different cd players, computers, there is no scratch on the disc, but it would not play at all"
3,"Great movie, poor shipping","Normally everything I order off amazon ships quickly, and arrives with out any issues. So when my movie arrived and the DVD case was broken, I was pretty disappointed. This movie is a part of a tradition in our family, so I was just thankful the dvd wasn't broken as well."
1,movie,after i downloaded this movie i was not able to view it.so i spent my money for nothing...it's just sitting there in my video library.
2,Blu Ray - Terrible tranfer,"I give the Blu-Ray 2 stars. The movie is good, the DVD version is good. But they didn't lift one finger to improve the content for Blu Ray. This is an awful Blu Ray. It would have been very easy to perform some minor clean up for BD release, but they didn't bother. To see a picture that is boarder line VHS quality when you just spent more than twenty bucks on a ""High Definition"" disk. They should be ashamed.If you have the DVD or VHS, skip this fraud of a Blu Ray."
5,Not just for kids,"You might think that stories about Santa and Rudolph and Nestor the Donkey are just for kids. Year Without a Santa Claus appeared on TV while I was in grad school, and my friends and I were immediately fans of it and watched it year after year as we tried to complete our Ph.D's. As other reviewers have mentioned, it has a great cast, worthy of a Broadway hit, all of whom obviously took their work seriously. Nothing shoddy here. Lots of humor and cleverly written songs. The Mini-Me version chorus lines of the Miser Brothers are hysterical. The song ""Believe in Santa Claus"" may well bring a tear to your eye. Ditto the other two entries on the disc. Red Skelton was well into his 60's when he starred in Rudolph's Shiny New Year, and his touching rendition of ""The Moving Finger Writes"", concerning the inexorable passage of time, was particularly poignant for me, who just turned 50 in 2001. Great, sophisticated family entertainment, never dumbed down for the kids."
4,Childhood memories come alive,"The deluxe edition of this Rankin Bass special is a must see for kids today and for the kid in all of us who saw it when it first came out. Although they are really secondary characters in this Holiday special, the Miser Brothers(and their catchy theme song) really stand out. Santa is a bit grumpy for awhile (though he often has an ""attitude"" in these Rankin Bass specials)but, as it should be, he comes through in the end. Also, I'm not sure what Charlie Chaplin is doing in the crowd scene in South Town, but ""what the heck"", most kids today wouldn't know who he is anyway. The show still holds up and is a lot of fun to watch. This new disc has great picture quality and the extras are fun and informative."
3,Good Movie,I grew up with this movie and others like it and even though Christmas is when we celebrate Jesus' birthday this is a funny movie.
5,Who doesn't love this holiday film,"Really, who wouldn't give this a 5 star rating - It is a classic holiday special that brings us back to our childhoods"
5,FINALLY! A RANKIN/BASS Documentary!,"I was gald to help SPARKHILL with the documentary that is on this DVD! Finally, you will hear from the creators. While I applaud WARNER BROTHERS for including this, I wish their legal dept. would have let the RANKIN/BASS archives flourish in this doc as well BUT they did not. At least the interviews are here and you get to hear from the creators themselves! Maybe now, WB will do a RANKIN/BASS DVD box set and include what fans have been asking for: THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF SANTA CLAUS, THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY, BOOK 2, PINOCCHIO'S CHRISTMAS, THE LEAPRECHAUN'S CHRISTMAS GOLD, etc. There also needs to be a deluxe edition of THE FLIGHT OF DRAGONS. If WB owns THE BERMUDA DEPTHS, that needs to come out too. HAPPY HOLIDAYS 2007!"
4,"Year with out a Santa Claus good, Nestor Great!!!","Year without a Santa Claus is a good story with some catchy tunes. The story has some memorable characters like Mother Nature and her two sons, the Heat and Snow Miser. The voices are done very well and the music is great.The Gem in this collection is Nestor the Long Eared Christmas Donkey. This is a story about a misfit donkey who longs to find his place in the world. Lo and behold he finds his niche and of course it is a very important one. This story is about the true meaning of christmas. Caution! You will need a box of tissues to make it through this one. This is a must have for all families."
4,100% classics,"All three videos are classics from my 30 something childhood - 100% worth the memories relived and the new ones with my kids - go, heat miser!"
5,A triple feature...,"I bought this DVD mainly for ""The Year Without A Santa Claus"". I just fell in love with the TV classic. I had never seen this until 6 years ago and I just loved it. And who can resist the antics of the brothers Snow Miser and Heat Miser. They are hilarious. Plus with the other 2 features (though they never were quite as popular), this is a great family DVD. Now you can watch it anytime you want. Worth the money."
5,Great!,Arrived promptly and is one of my favorite Christmas classics. I can't wait to be able to watch it anytime I want!
5,christmas movies,"i was looking for a dvd of the Nestor, the Long-Eared Donkey movie and went on amazon and was so excited to get one, not only for an exellent price, but it came with two more favorite christmas movies! the dvd was in excellent shape and it came sooner than expected."
5,Christmas Classic!,"One of my favorites. I love Ms. Claus, and the Miser Brothers. Amazing how many songs I can still sing along with even tho I had not seen this in so long. A little pricey, but worth it for those magical Christmas memories."
5,The Movies Are Priceless,I was so excited when I found the Christmas movies I was looking for. The quality is great. I am glad I bought it.
3,Classic,This is a cute seasonal musical for children of all ages. I saw it for the first time as a child and still have to watch it every year. My children are grown and they still watch it. Great for family time.
3,Rankin Bass wins me over.,"I grew up watching the famous christmas classics produced by Rankin/Bass, but I had never seen (or heard of) this movie until recently. I decided to order it with high expectations, but wasn't really all that thrilled with the overall make of the movie. Although I was a little disappointed, the movie is still a great addition to those who enjoy claymation films."
2,Poor information,Product didn't come with a case or Artwork. I was told it was listed that way by the seller but I did not see it(still haven't found any mention of no dvd box in description). I wouldn't have bought the item. In Discription there were several photos of the packaging. Amazon or Seller need to be clearer in the discription. There should have been a photo of my item exactly what I'd be receiving.
4,Great Holiday Classic,I loved watching this as a kid a real friendly and quaint Santa plot. The best in Stop-mation Rankin and Bass!!!!!
4,Adventurous Progressive Punk,"I saw this band years ago at a club in Chicago. If you like John Zorn styled avant rock, this is an excellent band."
4,organic cotton socks,"Excellent quality, medium weight, not too heavy, will not make shoes too tight. The color was NOT denim blue as requested though. It was aqua, and this was highly disappointing, as I wanted to wear with blue jeans."
4,Organic Cotton Socks,These cotton organic socks are very comfortable. I would buy lots more if they wern't so expensive.
2,"Comfortable socks, but they don't last","I love these socks. They are so comfy and I like that they are organic-no pesticides or other harmful stuff used to grow the cotton or manufacture the socks. The tie-dye ones are really fun. However, the last batch I bought--all of them developed holes in the heels after about two days of use. Granted my heels are a little rough, but a use-life of two days is just unacceptable, especially given the price and the fact that I'm not walking around that much. Unfortunately, I won't be buying these again."
3,holes in 2 weeks,I purchased these socks because they were supposed to be high quality organic cotton material but after only 2 weeks they developed holes in the toe. They are also confining and don't breath well. I won't purchase this product again
4,Maggie's Organic Socks,"Organic Cotton Crew SockI love the socks, great colors, very soft and comfortable. I call the tie-dyes my ""happy socks"" and I wear them especially when a day threatens to be gloomy. They are great cheer-up gifts, too! My only complaint is that the natural-color ones developed holes after a few months. These are too expensive for me to replace them too often. Otherwise, they're the best socks available."
3,Not what I expected,"Its a bit too scientific for my taste, too much math and not enough focus on what the real issues are with ecology."
5,The Beginning of the End,"Secrets are revealed as the final battle takes place! Eriol, Spinel Sun, Ruby Moon, and their plans reveal themselves. In order to save the town, her family, her friends, and her guardians, Sakura must find a way to change the last two cards into her own. Can she do it or will everyone sleep forever?One of the best CCS books ever a a must read for any fan! Read to find out what happens to Sakura in the second to last installment of Cardcaptor Sakura! Enjoy!"
3,Mood music,"'On The Ellipse' is one of those albums that gradually builds and crafts a mood throughout, never letting a note break the feel. Lilting, sleepy vocals drift over pastoral acoustics and howling distortions on a psychadelic, dream-like canvas. Like Sonic Youth meets Mogwai, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd and Opeth and together they are swept into a night-time dreamworld where everything is slowed and buzzes like a different reality. My only criticism of the album is that it rarely varies style and all 6 of the long pieces here follow the same sort of a structure. It feels like it could be a movie soundtrack: for an eerie, cyber-alternate, drugged-up underworld of a film. The way flutes sit over resounding, deafening over-distorted guitars really is heavenly. This is a wonderful underground recording which though too specialised to be appealing to everyone, or even the majority of people, and only right for certain moods, is glorious for those of us that do enjoy this sort of music."
3,Bardo Pond - 'On The Ellipse' (Touch & Go) 3 1/2 stars,"Believe this to be the band's sixth proper CD. Maybe not one of Bardo Pond's mind-blowing releases but I thought that 'On The Ellipse' was okay. Tunes that I liked the most were the nine-minute ""Every Man"", ""Dom's Lament"" (featuring some rather nice flute and guitar work), the ten-minute droning typical Bardo Pond-style ""Test"" and the lengthy (yet, still good to listen to) low-key ""Night Of Frogs"" which (mind you) brings to mind an earlier Bardo Pond piece - 'Lapsed'. Personnel: Isobel Sollenberger - flute, violin & vocals, Michael Gibbons - guitar, Clint Takeda - bass and John Gibbons - synthesizer, guitar & percussion. Might appeal fans of My Bloody Valentine, Spacemen 3 and possibly Sonic Youth."
2,Disappointing,"By all means this is not a bad album. In fact, if they had never produced anything else, it would be amazing. However, Bardo Pond have always been trailblazers in the realm of psychedelic rock, each album contributing new sounds to their bag of tricks. I remember being amazed at how many changes and variations occured on Dilate, and yet they still managed to have a consistent, whole sound. Popping in Ellipse, I found myself bored as track after track provided nothing that hadn't been thoroughly explored by the group in previous outings. Indeed, it seems like they took the first track off Dilate and multiplied it six times, each track starting on a mellow riff and building to a loud, emotional finish. I'll give them that its their most consistent sounding recording to date, but I feel that it results in a stagnant, repetitive and unimaginative album. Very disappointing in light of brilliant and exciting works such as Lapsed or Dilate."
2,Nice Packaging...,"I've purchased other CDs from the Sepia label, so I was a fairly high level of sound quality (Sepia is generally near the top of the import labels that record from old records). Unfortunately, this album fell far below their usual standard.The sound is okay on the instrumental sections, but breaks up whenever Monica Lewis sings. Each of her words end in a garbled, crackling due to sound distortion on the recording. It's barely listenable.There aren't a lot of Monica Lewis albums to choose from, so I'm giving them a second star for making some of her work available.All in all, you're better off copying her songs that are posted at youtube."
1,No Information,Would love to purchase this Item howerver it states nothing about the type of electrical hook up. There are a couple of different kinds. From 3 to 5 prong systems.
5,Very Best in its Field,"This is the first instrumental album I turn to for car and home listening. It's an essential album for guitar fans and for country music fans and students. It's unlike Nokie's later albums with The Doughboys which are more pop-oriented and Ventures'-style. This masterpiece, however, is much rawer and roots-oriented, and it sizzles from song-to-song with funky feel. Just wait until you hear ""The Orange Blossom Special"" and ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"". I heard Nokie with The Doughboys in concert in Mesquite, Texas, and it was the best variety show and musical festival I've ever attended. The electricity between the musicians and in the auditorium was atomic-powered.This Nokie-Light Crust Doughboys series including CHRISTMAS albums, country-folk albums and pop albums is one of the greatest series of albums in instrumental music history."
1,In Future = No Sound Samples = Won't Buy.,"I was hoping for western swing with a little more surf twang in the leads than the Bob Wills variety, what I got was what it would sound like if a Monkees cover band did these tunes and dropped out the vocals. Overproduced, overbearing country-type elevator music. As each track started I kept reaching to turn down the volume a little more ...and Beer Barrel Polka wherein someone is banging against a mic does not help the mix. Lesson learned."
1,Not my cup of tea...,"I love vintage music like Bob Wills western swing and even newer bands like Asleep At The wheel. This cd is not too good, the playing isn't authentic western swing, and I don't much care for it, it's slightly annoying..."
5,Why did Cliff have to go?,"Cliff was obviously the most talented part of Metallica, and established them as the heavy metal Behemoths of the eighties and early ninties. While he died in '86 (RIP) his influence on Metallica survived, and is one reason why 'Justice' and black album were great. This video captures Cliff at some of his finest monents with Metallica, and it is clear that he wont be forgotten any time soon. Cliff 'Em All proves how important Burton was to Metallica, and without him, they would have sounded much, much different. They say only the good die young, like Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and Kurt Cobain (that last could be argued), Cliff Burtons influence will not vanish in the realm of rock.Oh yeah, there was one reviewer who said this was missing something. I do agree that this should have had Orion (the bass solo kicks ass in that), but I dont think its a big problem."
5,THE THING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN,"This video is indispensible for those who want to remember Metallica as the great band they once were. Featuring bootleg performances of songs from Cliff Burtons days with the band as well as photos and rare footage CLIFF EM ALL is the sort of no frills, no BS you got from Metallica before they let everything go to their heads and started releasing mediocre material. Its great to see Dave Mustaine on lead guitar early on. But all Metallica is these days is Kirk Hammett and a couple of middle aged egomaniacs. Sad really. Cliff would be turning in his grave."
4,Remember the good old days?,"Yes this DVD was dedicated to the memory of Cliff Burton, but it's also a tribute to old-school Metallica. Ah... the good old days. When it was all about the music. This DVD is excellent. Some people complain about poor quality, both visual and audio, but if you consider how old the footage is (and bootlegs nontheless), you'll be amazed at the quality. After reading other reviews I expected something pretty bad. Man, was I amazed!Yes, maybe this is not the ideal DVD to turn someone who has never heard of Metallica, but the bottom line is that if you're a true fan, you will not be dissappointed with buying this. Trust me, I'm not regretting buying this!"
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It's great. It's a good way for all the new fans to see Cliff in action
5,This video rules!!!,"While the video and audio may not be top quality, the fact that it's dedicated to Cliff makes it worth if for any Metallica fan. This is an important part of Metallica history that all fanz should own."
4,Great Tribute,"""Cliff 'Em All"" is the ultimate tribute to Cliff Burton, former bass player of Metallica. This video consists of 90 minutes of Metallica concert footage from 1983 to 1986 (Keep in mind that all of this footage was shot on early '80s VHS film, so the video and audio quality are extremely poor for DVD.) The video has been cleaned up somewhat from the VHS release of this title, but imperfections from the source tape are still easily recognizable. The audio is in mono, and isn't of the best quality, but it does come across a tad cleaner with DVD. However, this is a must-buy for hardcore Metallica (and possibly even Megadeth - Dave Mustaine plays on a few songs) fans simply for the fact that it captures the early vengeance of live Metallica, and is the ultimate tribute to Cliff Burton. Don't expect super hi-res picture quality or Dolby 5.1 surround; just expect raw, angry, intelligent heavy metal from the best rock band of all time."
5,VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!,"I read the reviews before buying this DVD and I feared that the sound was going to be bad, but no, it is good, as soon as the image, this DVD is a good sample of the years of the best songs and the best line-up of Metallica."
3,Cliff on Bass!,This is all bootleg footage that the band has collected. It is interesting to see what the fans in the audience focused on vs what a professional film maker would have.
1,Sorry but I think I've been ripped off!,"I have read the reviews of this DVD submitted by other fans of Metallica and believe an honest account may save some money for someone. I too am a fan, not only of the band but also the DVD format. This recording may well be 'raw' and 'gutsy' but I found it disappointing. It does no justice to the band or the format. The picture quality is very poor throughout and the sound is terrible. Sorry but it's only fair that people are aware of what to expect. Save your money for a more recent Metallica production. I wish I did!"
4,Must have,"This is a Must have for any Metallica fans! It contains the following Songs1.Creeping Death2. Am I Evil3.Damage inc.4. Master of Puppets5. Whiplash6. The Four Horsemen7. Fade to Black8.Seek and Destroy9. Sanitarium10. For Whom the bell Tolls11. No Remorse12. Metal MilitiaI gave this only 4 stars because the quality isnt the best, but still, not bad"
3,Almost 80's,"The music is appealing because it relies on 80's style rock to create an atmosphere of ""good-natured"" fun. Unappealing is the blending of a 90's ""club-dance"" sound."
4,Simply Awsome,Im a hardcore bears fan and there really isnt much this DVD didnt tell me that i wanted to know and i recommend it for any Bears fan out there ^_^
4,Diehard,"I gave this to a much younger sibling, hoping that he would actually learn a little bit about our beloved Chicago Bears. He hadn't even opened it, but I've watched it a couple of times. Even though I knew a good deal of this already, it was fun to see it."
3,"Good, but could be better","I'm glad to have all of this NFL Films highlight material on DVD, but as Da Coach himself once said there's more to be done here.The Bears are the oldest team in the NFL, and so for my tastes there's just too much glossed over here. Where's the coverage of Payton's passing as well as the emotional win the following week in Green bay by a blocked field goal? That's just one of the many highlights left out. Just look at the current DVD sets by the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Chicago Bulls and you'll see what we really should be getting; which is complete games on DVD. The NFL needs to get out of this antiquated thinking that fans won't come and see the new team if they have old video of glory days on DVD.That's just silly, so enjoy this package for what it is but know that there could be a better one if the NFL and current owners of the Bears choose so."
2,Bears Video,"I found the product description misleading. It claimed to include ""complete coverage of Super Bowl XX"" which I interpreted as being the complete game broadcast rather than a couple of minutes of highlight clips."
4,For Size--Maintains Scent Well and Relatively Powerful,"This is a nice size to try a scent and it also does have a pretty enough container to give as a small gift. It maintains its potency when kept closed and it does fragrant an room pretty well if not too large. It burns evenly and lasts a relatively long time compared to the size. It is a bit expensive for the size, but I think the quality out-weighs this negative. The scent-- I am having a hard time defining it (I know... not helpful in a review). It is slightly pine-y, fruity but not overly sweet, and almost leathery. It does not smell yummy or sexy-- it is more a sophisticated clean. Everyone asks what it is, and the majority love it but aren't sure exactly why. I like it enough that I've taken the plunge to buy the bigger pagoda size as well (which REALLY perfumes a decent size room nicely)."
4,Absolutely fascinating exploration of sin.,"This book was ranked as Christianity Today's Book of the Year for 1996, and it is well deserving of the honor. Plantinga has done a remarkable job of describing sin in all its various forms as well as its myriad of subtle dynamics and seductions.His general thesis is that sin is a disruption of the shalom of God - anything that detracts from the way things are supposed to be. So the Christian task in counteracting the forces of sin in the world is to do whatever possible to restore shalom.Sin may not seem like a cheery topic, but this book is truly edifying. Highly recommended."
4,A Needed and Relevant Understanding of Sin,"Cornelius Plantinga has given us such an important understanding of sin for the 21st century. Defining it as the ""vandelism"" of God's shalom communicates sin's pervasive destructiveness. Whether it be in personal relationships, business dealings, use of the environment, or other aspects of life, the selfish explotation of the other damages it's integrity. People ulimately get hurt and suffer in real life, not in some theological construct that so many Christians can get focused on. God's shalom is the peace, the well-being, that He intends for all aspects of creation. It is based on His love for that same creation. I know that the world would be a better place if more people understood the violence that we do to our world and to each other by looking out for number one, and that love covers a multitude of sins."
4,Dewalt saw,"Not a bad saw for limited use. The power is adequate, no more, but the light weight and somewhat limited power really work to it's advantage. The limited power is nice because when you are making an over the head cut, standing on one foot,on a ten foot ladder,the saw has enough power to make the cut but not to kick back at you if you get slightly off center. This will not replace your corded saw but it will certainly give it quite a rest."
3,Battery problem?,"I agree with Tom. Either the battery supplied with my tool is defective, or the saw was designed to require much more power than an 18-volt battery can supply. I bought this saw to break down large sheets of hardwood plywood for furniture building. It's lightweight and more convenient than my large, electric 7.25-inch circular saw, so those characteristics are good. And I like the blade-on-the-left, too. However, as I said earlier, the battery seems much too wimpy for this tool and I spend more time recharging than I do cutting."
4,GREAT SAW !!!! Now my professional contractor friends want one!!!,"Some friends and I, one of which works for PORTER CABLE, a couple of contractors and myself went to build a wheelchair ramp as a church project for an elderly couple. The guys laughed at me when I showed up with my Dewalt DW939 saw. About an hour into our work the power went out in their neighborhood. I handed my saw to the professional contractor that was doing all the cutting and he used it and said it cut smoother than his milwalkie 7 1\4"" corded. We did the whole ramp and only had to replace the battery toward the end. Both of the contractors and the guy from Porter Cable all said that they were going to get one ASAP!! My DW939 saved the day!!!My only complaint was fixed in the DC930 and that was the ergonomics of the handle. the DW939 is fine if you are cutting short distances but when cutting across a 4x8 sheet it is hard to hold your hand parallel to the cutting surface."
3,How do you snap this together?,"I really like this product, but neither my sister,my husband nor I can figure how to snap it together so we can best use it. The directions are not clear. Just throwing it over us defeats its purpose. Please correct this so we can use it properly. It is a great invention, but needs to return to the drawing board for a slight delay."
2,Snuggle Blanket,I was not able to see all of the snaps on this blanket in the picture. I was not very pleased with the product and I will be returning it.
3,Maxam Fleece Snuggle Blanket SOFT AND WARM,"The blanket is soft and warm. The snaps are too far apart and falls open in the front. It is a great product, I just added a few snaps to make the blanket fit my size."
3,Better As A Blanket,"As a robe, the arms are restricting. The design needs improvement. I would rather have velcro or a zipper than the large, difficult to open snaps. I use the item solely as a nice, soft, fleece blanket. Even as a blanket, the price is right."
2,Not like what is shown on Amazon,"I received this as a Christmas present. My husband thought that it was going to be a real pretty Green Plaid robe. On the package it shows a green plaid snap robe. What is in the package is a PLAIN blue zip robe. The zipping part is OK, I guess. The top part zips, then the lower part zips up. Then there is velcro to hook the top to the bottom. It is too involved to just grab & put on, so I will probably just use it as a throw blanket.They really should only sell what the picture shows, not bait & switch & send something else."
2,only okay,"Tbis is not exactly what my son wanted, it is hard to figure out how to re snap, and get into, not for everybody, too small for my husband. Blanket is soft, I use it more as a blanket."
3,Snuggie postage ripoff!,"The snuggie's that I bought are okay.After waiting over 3 months to get them, they serve their purpose well. The snuggie's themselves were $38.90. The POSTAGE was $36.00!!!! Remember that they charge you $7.95 postage for each blanket which weighs less than 1 lb."
1,Not like the ones on TV,"The arms snap together. The picture doesn't do this justice. I bought from Amazon for convenience instead of purchasing a real ""snuggie"". Don't make same mistake."
5,Exceptional,"This is an exceptional docudrama about the founding of Microsoft, Apple and the cutthroat computer industry of the early 80's. The accuracy is near perfect. Both Anthony Michael Hall and Noah Wyle give an incredible depth to Bill Gates and Steve Jobs - helping us appreciate their mindsets and personalities.The movie also skillfully breaks the fourth wall using, the actors playing, Steve Ballmer and the Steve Wozniak. This important commentary gives the audience insight that might not have been possible given a typical movie format.All in all, a great movie for those who love computer history or just love human drama."
4,Great movie.,"This is a surprisingly good movie, especially for being made for television. I think the casting really makes it - especially Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates, but Noah Wylie is great as Steve Jobs, too. Parts of it get a little too dramatic for my taste, enough where I think ""this COULDN'T have happened,"" because it seems so contrived, but like I said, the acting just keeps pulling you back in."
4,Very amusing!,"A good story well told. Not VERY VERY accurate, but using the material to its most humourous potential. Always interesting to see films about people who truly changed the world/made a difference!"
3,good but not accurate,"the movie paints a good picture of the people in the movie, and touches on a lot of realistic events, but is not totally accurate"
3,"Cheezefest, but also insightful","The video is brutally honest about how Jobs neglects his daughter and abuses Apple employees. He seems to have had a hard time dealing with his own illegitimacy (he was adopted) It is no coincidence that he shaped the Mac project to be the ""bastard"" project that tears Apple apart from within. Too bad the movie didn't spend a little more time on this theme. I also loved the climactic scene where Gates and Jobs confront eachother. Although certainly fictional, it sums up the Mac/PC war brillaintly. Jobs shouts about how the Macintosh is a superior product, and Gates, almost whispering, answers ""That doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter"""
5,I am very happy with this item.,I am very happy with this item. I very much enjoyed this DVD. I would recommend it to others. Thank you.
5,WOW.,"This is a movie that needs to be seen by every American. I believe that they should show this movie to kids in middle school in a class. It's highly entertaining and informative which is rare. Movies are usually one or the another. It's a story about two of the most successful people in the world, who both have had a impact on society. Everyday people are using a product if not made by them, inspired by them most likely. It's a great way to see how they reached the stature they both now have. I believe it's like the social network. It's similar in that both tell the tale of people and they work which are very used things today."
5,What it was about,"In the end, most people know who Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are. If you're into computers or watch the news it is kinda hard not to know. What I liked the most about this movie is the underlining story of Steve Wozniak. In the end both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are businessmen. The person who is mostly responsible for today's computers is Steve Wozniak. Gates and Jobs only marketed products made by other people like The Woz as he was called.At times the acting in this movie is a little over the top and the story is exaggerated from what rely happened. But everything that is in this movie did happen just not to the domination level in this movie."
4,A delightful little time capsule,"I enjoyed this movie when it first aired on TNT, and only recently got around to buying it.As others have said, it's a reasonably accurate portrayal of the beginnings of Apple and Microsoft. Though, Pirates really shows its age today. Keep in mind that when this was made in 1999, there was no iPod or OS X, and the iMac hadn't been available long enough to show any sort of turnaround for Apple.Also at the time, Microsoft's plagues of security vulnerabilities and missed product deadlines were rarely published in mainstream media. So with all things considered, it's interesting to see this again, with today's perspective.As far as the DVD goes, it's pretty sparse on extras (a 5 minute clip of Noah W. and a trailer), and perhaps more disappointingly, is displayed in 4:3. I can't complain too much for a made-for-tv movie, but you don't really get tons of value for what this disc costs."
4,Very well done...,"This is a pretty close account of how our technology (of today) started. I too watched this movie when it came out on cable (TNT) and enjoyed it. I would say this movie is about 85-90% accurate at the time when Microsoft and Apple came about. Very good acting from all actors. If you are interested in how the two giants started, this is the movie to start with. This movie is a keeper!"
4,The Pirates Of Silicon Valley,If you use a computer or enjoyed the social network film you will enjoy this.Not to be missed if you have windows on your pc or own an apple computerIt tells the story of how microsoft and apple developed and the rivalry betweeen Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Give it whirl!
4,"if u hate computers, u will luv it even more","you dont have to be a geek to enjoy this well written, acted, factual & entertaining story. i didnt know what to expect. i really thought it would be a lot of boring and technical things, i was wrong. this is one of the finast features ever! good move not to relase it in the theatre, it probablyy would have bombed. i only saw it on tv but i will by it. hopefully there are a few extra scenes. too bad its so expensive & not on dvd yet. the story is true & cut throat! lots of hostility, anger & slyness. gripping plot about rivals in business until one man rules the wold.great stuff, not to miss"
5,The greatest show ever made,"Pirates of Silicon Valley is definitely my favorite movie. Myself, and other computer geeks will appreciate what Steve Jobs, Woz, and Bill Gates did to change the computing industry. The movie tells the story of Microsoft's rise to power and the rise and fall of Apple computer fairly accurately. I used to think the Empire Strikes Back was the best movie. After seeing Pirates of Silicon valley I realized I was wrong, very wrong."
3,Way nerdy,"Dorky, but lovable. Noah Wyle (of ER fame) played that wacky Steve Jobs pretty well. The guy who played Bill Gates was also sufficiently dorky and annoying. The only problem with making a movie based on real life? You have to use the real names. There were like 16 Steves, and I got confused (which, I admit, happens often anyway). Overall, not bad, but if you don't already know the history behind the whole thing, I doubt you'd be able to get it from this. It was a bit hard to follow."
3,Very interesting storyline,Very interesting story line but the person playing bill gates does not know how to act!
4,The Cliff Notes version of how it all happened.,"I'll keep it sweet & simple.The movie was very entertaining, an overview of what happened between both companies and their founders. A plus for those whose lives do not revolve around fixing or programming computers. But for me and my comrads, we know there was much more to the story. A pity the DVD did not supply allot of behind the scenes interviews with current and former employees of both Apple and Microsoft, nor any personal Bio's on both Gates and Jobs. Overall, fairly entertaining and would watch again."
5,Educational,"This movie was wonderful. I showed it to my math students as part of a project on computers. There is a stripper sceen and a little drug action so be careful showing it to kids. Beyond that it was wonderful. If you do not know that much about computers and their start, you will still enjoy this. We all know enough about windows and microsoft to be able to follow what goes on in the movie. I am going to buy it for sure."
5,"Great Portrayals, Terrific Movie!","I was SO impressed by this movie. You can really see the personality traits that took Gates and Jobs to where they have been and are now. I remember hearing stories of Jobs back in the 70's from friends that worked at Apple. Noah Whiley's portrayal was right on the mark! And then Gates's response to Job's insistance that Apple had the better product was ""You don't get it! It DOESN'T MATTER!"" Such a totally true statement. Rent it. Buy it. You won't be sorry!"
4,"Good history, okay acting.","I think there is some good accuracy as to how Jobs & gates were in their youth and how modern computing was affected by their actions. Acting was not so hot all around, but it was still a great movie."
5,Great,Love it... I used it in my courses...Me gusto mucho lo utilizo en mis cursos de introduccion a las computadoras.
5,Pirates of Silicon Valley,"Good movie, good on learning how computers became part of our lives. Shows interpersonal touch of how these men effects our way we live today."
5,Deja Vu,My personal favorite! Takes me back to some of the best times of my life! I think it is their best album/CD ever!!!!
1,damaged,someone must have stepped on it really really really really really really really really really really really really really really hard!
3,Texas Lullaby,There are a few good tunes on this album. I dont believe this is a Doobie Brothers masterpiece that title goes to Captain And me & What Were Once Vices. However the song Texas Lullaby is worth the price of the album alone.
4,A great guide to a great place,"This is very complete as a guidebook to the Flat Tops area. The information about each trail is good, and there are some nice pictures. Since the Flat Tops have such a large network of trails, though, it's sometimes difficult to find a description for a particular stretch. But overall, a nice guide."
2,Not effective,"I bought this attachment hoping to make dusting easier. It was too long for easy dusting in small areas. The brushes themselves are too long to allow much suction to pull up dust. All in all, it's pretty ineffective and I won't be using it again for most situations. It was a waste of money. I do love many Dyson products. Just not this one."
2,Nothing to Get Excited About,Too expensive. Doesn't work that great. Doesn't store on-board. Not soft or long enough for the dusting work.
1,Buyers beware... it BADLY scratched my NEW TV!!!,"Overall, this brush is great... EXCEPT that it pretty much scratched up the entire TV screen. It is advertised to ""...gently dust delicate surfaces. Keeps fans, blinds, televisions, and keyboards dust-free."" Not only that, but on the Dyson website, the demo shows the brush on the screen of a TV! I VERY carefully dusted my NEW TV, and it has scratches all over it now! EEEK! I am in contact with Dyson to see what they will do to fix the issue, and my TV. We'll see..."
2,Not as expected,"Well, it doesn't do much. I love my Dyson, and the floor attachment, but this is probably not worth buying.Added: I just read the other review... I haven't had that experience, but maybe my dust is finer than theirs. It definitely works on dust-bunnies ;-}"
1,don't waste your money!,Tried to use this brush on my blinds and it did absolutely nothing - still had to clean them with a cloth. Wish I hadn't wasted my money on this!
2,"Overpriced, not very soft, adequate brush","Just a plastic accessory - cheap construction and not much about the brush is ""soft"". The bristles are coarse enough to scratch some surfaces and would not good for use on delicate electronics or surfaces - I am even concerned about it being to rough for my dark wood tables.To call this a ""dusting brush"" seems misleading to me - for floors or relatively tough surfaces I guess it is ok but it there is certainly nothing here worth $30 by a long shot.Unless you just can't bear not having the Dyson purple to match your vacuum , look for a better brush. This one would be a much better buy around $15."
2,"Overpriced, unpleasant surprise","I give this product two stars, maybe 2.5. I paid $30 for it, because I thought having the reach of the hose combined with this would be great for doing our ceiling fans. But it's not. The brush isn't adjustable angle-wise, which makes dusting just about anything a labor of inflexibility (imagine dusting a plasma television with a broom, only you had to hold the broom parallel to the screen, rather than perpindicular). The product itself isn't very impressive. If I paid $10 for it, I'd be a lot more forgiving, but I paid three times that, and can only use it for about 10% of the dusting jobs my home requires. I don't recommend this product-if you want to spend that kind of money, but a swiffer-type product. They're adjustable and are better-suited for the job."
3,Could be Better,"Although the attachment works, it didn't live up to my expectations. I'd have liked softer bristles, and I think it needs to be more ergonomical. It didn't do a good job on my keyboard, but did do a nice job on the cpu air intake. It was fine for wood furniture and such, but it was difficult to maneuver. I'm glad I have it, but I wish it was a better design. This attachment is the ONLY disappointment I've had with my Dyson."
4,Dusting brush,I thought I was crazy for ordering this but it makes simple dusting so much easier than with a cloth.
5,Great attachment for Dyson,"I've had my Dyson for about 3 years now and heard about this attachment a year ago. I could never find it in the stores but am now kicking myself that I didn't look on line sooner! I love this attachment. It comes with a converter piece so it fits all Dyson models. The bristles are soft enough that you can use it on furniture without worrying about scratches. Only thing I was concerned about was that using it to vacuum literally my whole house, the vacuum itself got very hot and I think if I did it every week I'd end up burning out the motor. Overall though, it's an excellent attachment and well worth the $25. If you're anything like me, it's quite irritating to dust and see the particles floating around in the air. This takes care of that completely! It is awesome for vacuuming your window blinds as well."
1,didn't fit,Did not fit my Dyson - assumed it fit all Dyson products since it didn't indicate which models. Otherwise would have been great
3,Not fluffy enough and wrong angle,"The idea is good, to be able to vacuum and dust at the same time but i don't think they really thought it through.You can't change the angle of the head so when you're vacuuming the walls (or should i say, dusting the walls) its parallel to you and you have to contort to clean the flat surface.Non flat surfaces are just as difficult as you have to constantly change your position to get at all the angles.The bristles are not long enough or fluffy enough, they're just short and rigid. The part of the contraption you use the most is the tip, but strangely, this is where the bristles are the shortest - where you need them to be the longest!so, from using it a lot i think it should be bendable and with longer, fluffier brush head to really successfully dust the home while vaccumming up the dust.I wouldn't really recommend."
3,"It's okay, but nothing special.","It doesn't do a thing for blinds, and the soft round brush that comes on the Dyson does everything this one does. It's just not as big."
5,Well worth the money,"Even though this seems a little pricey for a piece of plastic and some bristles, it is worth the money. It does a fantastic job with all our household dusting needs. 2"" blinds have never been easier (and faster) to dust. All around, I give this 5 stars."
5,Great for shutters/blinds,"I bought this when I ordered my factory reconditioned Dyson Animal. This was worth the additional expense. I have plantation shutters and 2"" wood blinds on several windows in my house. The soft dusting brush attachment tremendously reduces the time I spend dusting them."
5,Great for wood blinds!,"I got the dusting tool recently and it makes life so much easier! I can swipe it on the wood blinds, along my bookshelves, around the TV....and dust doesn't go flying around in the air! Much easier than worrying about little hand dusters or storing old dusty t-shirts ripped apart for the job. Get this attachment!"
4,DUSTER CONNECTORS PROVIDED DON'T FIT ALL.....,"Dyson Dusting Brush AttachmentI bought the Dyson DC25 Ball and because I have 2"" blinds throughout my house I decided to order the dusting brush. Thanks to C. Vaughn's Review I learned that the connectors included by Amazon do not fit my DC25. A call to Dyson's service rep informed me that by ordering directly from them I would be sent the right connector for my vacuum...$36.94...more, but worth it if it works. Must congratulate the service rep, Shereen, who patiently helped me set up my vacuum which wasn't all that easy for me, disabled, 74 and not very mechanically savvy. She deserves 10 stars. I gave a 4 star review because I just now ordered it and am hoping, with fingers crossed, that it will be a 5 star winner! Just thought the above info would be helpful to someone else. Will write an update later."
3,Nice but expensive,This is a nice little duster but is very expensive. I am not sure I would do it again.
3,Dyson Dusting Brush,"Don't trust the picture if the color is important to you. Brush was not the purple color as shown in the picture. The clear one received works on both the older and newer Dyson models. I specifically ordered because of the purple color. I am pickie about such things, so I was disappointed when it arrived. Obviously, it performs the same function, but I am going to use the clear one I received to dust under furniture on my wood floors AND I am still looking to get a purple one for dusting my furniture and blinds."
3,Inflexible Brush,"For just a few dollars more you could have the multi-angle brush instead of this less useful one. I made the mistake of buying this one without realizing that the multi-angle brush was available. This one is way over-priced for what it is capable of doing, though it is marginally useful."
1,Not worth it,"I'm unimpressed and don't feel that this is worth the extra money. The brush attachment that the vacuum comes with works just as well, if not better. My Swiffer duster works better."
3,Not as pictured,"I thought i would receive a nice duster attachment that complemented my pretty dyson dc25. Not so - the item i received is black, red and clear. It works okay, not great, especially when it comes to ceiling fan blades and the shutter blinds on my windows. It takes several passes to get the dust off, and i wind up doing it by hand to save time. If i hadn't used this item, i would return it."
3,Quality = A+ | Actually Usefulness = C-,"This Dyson product is made great and matches the purple DC15 Animal perfectly. Fantastic design as well. Problem is the actually usefulness of the product. I have used it 1 or 2 times since purchase and it never worked well. I wanted this to specifically suck the dust off of my 50"" TV's screen - didn't work at all for this. It just doesn't suck up that well."
4,I don't need to buy swiffer any more!,"This is a must have item if you have a dyson vacuum.I used to buy swiffer to clean dust, but I don't need to buy that any more."
2,I guess it does the job,What a pain in the backside to use these things. It's a lot easier to just use a microfiber rag and a little spritz of cleaner.
5,A good tool to have for your vacuum!,"Generally, I use this tool for dusting and is very helpful when the brittle is very soft and gentle so it won't scratch the surface on your furniture!"
3,Found the dust rag does better job,"Gave it three stars as it's simply OKAY. I've used it on my blinds and it picks up ok there. I love my Dyson but the attachment hose is hard to maneuver for me, and with that trying to get this attachment across each blind is difficult. Attachment does not do well on flat surfaces. I will use again for my blinds and that's about it."
4,no more dusty flyaways,"i would rather vacuum dust than use a cloth/rag since all of it is contained. the low profile allows the brush to slide under many of our fixtures, allowing us to dust without moving them. its bristles are very soft. you will have to de-lint the bristles and inner lint brushes once in a while. my only complaint is that the bristles can snag and come out of place easily ."
4,Effective Tool,This brush is softer and finer than the one that comes with the machine. It has two holes. It seems very effective on blinds. I also use it on most hard surface because it covers more area. Is it worth the money? Is the value there? I think it's a little expensive; that's why I gave it 4-stars rather than 5.
2,basically useless,This brush is so much slower than dusting and doesn't really dust. The one exception already noted herein is that it's great for my laptop computer. I dust out the keyboard and screen with it and even run it over all the little vents.
4,Fascinating.,"In many ways, this is the best of Mordden's decade-by-decade series, as it covers the least-known period, the 1930s."
2,this is more summers than fripp,This cd sounds more Summers than Fripp. It is more accessable and is less exciting than other works Fripp has been associated with. Perfect for white bread suburban listening. I am a Fripp freak and wish his element was more forthcoming.
2,Mostly Summers with some interesting Fripp popping in,"As the liner notes (on the album I own) indicate, Bewitched consists mostly of Summers' work and compositions, due to Fripp not having the time in his schedule to join Summers for the work. For Fripp fans, expect an album more along the lines of ""Fripp shows up and adds some interesting accompaniment and a few solos."" For Fripp fans and collectors, the album has interesting points, but it's a step down from I Advance Masked, and not in the same ballpark as Fripp's contributions to, say, Another Green World or Scary Monsters."
4,Atmospheric dance and trance tracks.....,"The second collaborative album effort of Robert Fripp and Andy Summers, ""Bewitched"" is perhaps the more lively of the two, centering around the extended popish track ""What Kind of Man Reads Playboy?"" The use of the brand new (for '83/'84) Roland GR-700 guitar synth is very obvious; and the older GR-300 system (which was featured prominently on ""I Advance Masked"") still gets a good workout, and shines through as perhaps THE definitive voice as far as guitar synths were, and are concerned. I personally favour the two-part, 'woven' guitar work of Fripp and Belew (King Crimson), and that of Fripp and Summers on ""I Advance Masked"", but overall, ""Bewitched"" is an essential addition to the collection of any serious Fripp fan, and not to be over looked."
1,Liars,"Please note that this DVD says ""Language: English"". I did. I ordered it. I started watching it. It was in Japanese.So, I go to the audio section, wondering if there was a mistake. There was only Japanese audio.What. The. HELL?"
1,What A Nightmare,"I've purchased fax cartridges locally, and all of them had a piece of plastic that held the roll of carbon in the cartridge, but not this one!This meant that when I took it out of the box, the main roll fell onto the floor, unspooled, rolled across the floor (gathering dog hair) and was all crinkled and tangled. Seriously?I gave up trying to roll it back onto the spool and opened up the other (I had purchased 2 of them), carefully took it out of the box, juggled it around and finally got it into the fax machine with little crinkling, and manually tightened it up. Since then, it's jammed about a bazillion times, rolled up on itself, and generally is the biggest pain in the you know what.I will be shopping for a new fax machine at the beginning of the new year and will go with an ink jet fax rather one that takes carbon paper."
3,Great work shoe.,"I've had them for a year. Comfortable fit and well made. Fits true to size in length. A little wider than normal. It's the way the shoe is cut, more room for the toes but plenty of support in the arch and no slip in the heel. I'm happy with them.I'm on my feet for six to eight hours on concrete floors."
2,Rockport Quality Problem,Very disappointed in quality.Shoes marked as size 11.5 (Euro 46). These are barely an 11. Euro 46 is equivalent to 12-12.5. What is wrong here?Shoes are pretty waterproof but don't breathe so they are so hot they are uncomfortable indoors.Rockport used to make good shoes. I'll not buy another pair.
4,Great fun and exploration of blues styles for intermediate player,"Re print format I did check out the ""large"" format from the library first, then purchased this. Overall I think this format is better, but on some of the denser charts you may want to scan & enlarge for best legibility.The book goes over some basics but you need to have mastered beginning guitar to get the most from this book. E.g. the first track after tuning notes is way beyond beginner level of chord change tempo, and it helps greatly to already know how to read music and/or tabulature.The tracks are fun to play with and well recorded and add a lot to the value of the package. If you get through the entire book, having ""nailed"" each exercise, you will in fact be ""able"" to go on to do more blues playing with considerably improved aptitude and awareness of various techniques and styles within the blues genres."
1,Good Content - Poor Format,"I have bought many Hal Leonard materials before and this is the first that I am not able to use. As a guitarist there are two essential things that I look for. One is excellent content, and this book has it. The other is the ability to use it on a music stand. This format (9""X6"" with a solid spine) is just not useable. It doesn't stay open to a given page, and the text and notes are too small to see from the normal viewing distance on a music stand. I therefore have not been able to use it as intended. I believe that a standard size format exists and I will pursue that instead.Bruce E."
4,Cool,"L7 fans, are you missing L7? Well, this is the closest thing right now. A former band mate from L7 gives us a new band. So, The other star people, her other band didn't do so will. But, get give this a chance, its different in a good way!"
5,A Digital Darkroom in the Field,"Awesome is a horribly overused word, but this little puppy earns major kudos! It's terrbily intuitive, easy to use, runs on a honking big NIMH battery (or AC) and -- yes -- produces dye-sub prints that are rich and gorgeous and tough-to-tell from conventionally processed ones. If the big chasm preventing digital photography from going mainstream has been the lack of physical prints that you can stick in an envelope and mail to the relatives (or carry around in your pocket), the P-200 more than bridges that gap. It's a masterpiece of engineering."
4,Nice but some shortcomings,"It overheats if asked to do more than 5 prints in a row. Once cooled (45sec.), it will continue, but heat problem & delays get worse. Considered a ""normal"" condition in the manual! Like a Windows crash is a ""feature""???"
5,A good investment,"Concise, precise and with hands-on examples of entire projects. This book is scattered with coloured screenshots to illustrate their instructions so you never have to guess what the authors mean. Targetted at the absolute beginner (in programming) but as it is a breeze to read, the more advanced reader is sure to pick up a few VB gems on his stroll through it."
1,choose another,"this book is not for those who want to learn vb by doing but by reading. visual basicis code,pure and simple. if you want to learn what happens when you press a button orenter your name in a textbox you have to not only learn the coding but also have topractice the coding several times. having an exercise or two at the end of a lengthy chapter with tons of coding to memorize is impractical, insufficient, and educationallydeficient. for those who know calculus it's like reading a chapter on derivatives andhaving to learn 30 rules before doing any exercises. that's why good math books todayare broken up into small sections with problems to do at the end of each section.bradley tries hard to teach the reader about vb using lengthy passages about coding but doesn'texplain in detail after the code is written what each line in the code actually does.my recommendation for those wanting to learn vb- get a different book.diane zak's is a 1000 times better-lots of hands-on exercises."
3,good for a classrom book,"good book as a classroom study, not so good as a self learner. lot's of info missing that you would get in an interactive environment, such as the exercise answers. and no website available for more info as many others provide. as a class text this is understandable as the students normally wouldn't have all the answers available to them except thru the teacher."
1,Programming in Visual Basic 6.0,"I NEVER ordered this book but you sent it and charged me for it anyway. I returned it upon its arrival but had to go to extreme hastles to communicate with you people. Have you re-embursed my account yet? That's the first time I've ever had a problem with Amazon, but I still love you."
4,Enjoyed it,"This is the second Valtos book I have read. I also read the ""Authenticator."" What made both books so interesting to me was the detail Valtos goes into to describe some amazing things - near death experiences and reincarnation. That detail can also slow down the reading a bit so I give this 4.5 stars instead of 5.The basic idea of this book is our hero, Theo, finds himself investigating the claims of a young nun that she is Mary Magdalene reincarnated. Takes a little while for the book to get going but once it did, I couldn't put it down. We run into our old friends the Templars along the way as well. Not sure if this was written before or after ""The Divinci Code"" but it certainly deals with some the same themes. I was ok with that. It was fun to go down that story line again from a different angle. Enjoyed it!"
5,Don Barnes rules (literally).,"This, the last album to feature Don Barnes on lead-vocals before he left, is filled with great songs. The sound is poppier than ever before... and then again it's not. It's really only on the first hearing; then you realize there's plenty of hard hitting guitar-work. The band (or producer Keith Olsen) seem to have decided that Barnes' voice is better suited for these songs, than co-lead-singer Donnie Van Zant; and thus Barnes is now given the bulk of songs. And he is indeed one of the best in the trade. (-I've always loved the way he sometimes starts a line way deep.) My favorite album of theirs has always been ""Tour De force"", but this one comes very close. Too bad he left the band when he did; things were never to be the same again."
4,Add this one to your collection,"This is a very decent album. I am not a huge fan, but this album and Special Forces are true classic rock albums. There is not a bad track on this CD. And some of these are some really good rockers!!!Unfortunately, this was the last good album .38 Special made."
3,Clock talks all day!!!,"I was very disppointed with this clock!! When we first received it, the kids were happy and it seemed fun to talk to the clock and get answers to questions like: What time is is? What are the alarm sounds? You can even ask it a fortune. Then this thing started talking all day and night!! First we noticed that is talks when someone is talking in the house. It says, ""Yes?"". Then we noticed that sometimes is talks for no reason, even at night when the house is quiet. This thing is driving me crazy!! Even the kids are complaining that it is waking them up! I don't know how long we will keep it."
3,Cute But Annoying,"This clock is really cute. I love watching my daughter try to talk to it. However, it can be annoying because it must be sensitive to sounds and will start talking when least expected. Therefore, it can be annoying."
4,funny clock,"This clock not only works well but it is hysterical. When we call upstairs for one of the kids, the clock always answers!! When the girls are playing in thier room it joins in. The nightlight works well too."
1,Junk,"My 9 yo daughter was very excited to rec'v this for Christmas. However, the clock didn't work very well upon opening. On the chance that it did (1 out of 10 tries) you literally had to SCREAM into it, in order for it to respond. My two daughters share a room and the very last thing I need, is for them to start the day screaming...even if it is just at a clock."
4,PERFECT GIFT FOR A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL,This clock is easy to use for any child. The digital numbers are big and the fact that the clock speaks helped both my children ( 4 yrs and 6 yrs) to read the time. Most mornings the alarm clock gets my daughter up for school without my assistance. It was given a 5 star rating by my daughter's last set of sleepover guests. The only annoyance is the chime which goes every hour. It can be turned off but lets hope your kids aren't like mine who love it on.
3,A very limited notion of emotional content,"The title of this book is at least somewhat misleading, since Brommer uses such a narrow and arguably pedestrian notion of emotional content in painting. This is not to say that this book has no value, but it is much more of a how-to book than the title suggests. The focus of the book is really on painting technique, not emotional content. If you want to be challenged philosophically and creatively about infusing emotional content into your paintings (such as can be found in the emotionally expressive works of painters like Munch, Kollwitz, O'Keeffe, or Pollock, for example) then you'll need to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you want to focus on how to represent landscapes, townscapes, seascapes, and other traditional painting subjects using watercolor alone or combined with Brommer's trademark collage approach, then you might find the book worthwhile (but much of the material here can be found in his earlier book on watercolor and collage)."
4,Watercolor book,"This is one book which I enjoyed reading and putting it to practice. The title really explains it all. If you want pointers to use painting (and collage) to express your feelings and interpret it, see examples from other artists' works - this is the book for you. It's simplified so that it can reach the public (no fancy words). I really enjoyed this book and also his other books and videos like watercolor and collage etc. Gives me a good feeling that I can do it too."
1,They lied about it being in stock,"Amazon said this was in stock, and still say it is in stock two weeks aftermy order. But immediately after I ordered it, theyt told me it is backordered and have not responded to requests for an ETA or resolution. On the phone they said it was the fault of Adorama, a Marketplace vendor. But since Amazon still lists it as in stock and shipping directly from Amazon, it is clear I cannot believe their in-stock claim. Amazon said they will not help me resolve this, that I must deal with Adorama, whoever that is. I could have gotten it elsewhere for less, and sooner, but chose Amazon because I trusted them. My mistake."
2,Disappointed,"It wasn't what I was expecting. I thought it would have more in depth numbers such as fat, carb, ect. It only listed calories. I ended up returning it since I wanted so much more information. I thought it was great that there were caloric listings for many popular products and fast food places but it still wasn't enough for me to keep it."
2,Flavor not that great,"I finally tried the Basil Olive and was disappointed. It had a bitter taste. I bought the 4 piece sampler from Mantova and was very happy. I used it on cold pasta and veggies, and bread and all four were delicious. Since I especially liked the basil I ordered the larger bottle. I'm not sure why the larger bottle had a bitter taste. I did use half basil and half a extra light olive oil when I served the samplers, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it or not. I'm going to try that and see if it works. If it does I'll amend my review. If not then I'm afraid I'll have to stick with this one and won't be ordering it again."
4,"Must Have, Must See",I found this movie to be a real tearjerker. I was touched as well as everyone that I saw it with.
1,The best compilation ever!,"I love this CD! It has the best most talented bands and singers ever! Not only are the good bands only on MTV, but also Nick and every other kid network. I especially love the Clay aiken song; he's soooooooooooooo emtional and talented poseur bands like Fear Factory wish they were this good!!! It also has the bestest band of all times: Good Charlotte! Fo not buy any underground garbage, support the mainstream!If you took ANY of that seriously, this CD is for you."
1,THE FALL OF GOOD MUSIC.,"GOOD MUSIC IS FADING AWAY. INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO GREAT BANDS THAT ACTUALLY SOUND GOOD SUCH AS THE WHO, LED ZEPPLIN, THE RAMONES, THE BEATLES AND MANY OTHER GREAT BANDS WHICH SOME OF THEM ARE EVEN SUITIABLE FOR KIDS, WE GET AWFUL BANDS LIKE SWITCHFOOT, GOOD CHAROLOTE, AND LIL ROMEO. THIS TEACHES CHILDREN NOT TO APPRECIATE THE GOOD MUSIC. WHEN ALOT OF KIDS LISTEN TO THESE BANDS THAT CAN ACTUALLY PLAY, ALL THEY SEE THEM AS IS OLD MUSIC AND THEN THEY WATCH MTV'S ASHLLEE SIMPSON SHOW. NONE OF THESE BANDS HAVE ANY IF LITTLE TALENT. INSTEAD OF QUEEN'S HIT 'BOHEMIAM RHAPSODY', WE GET GOOD CHAROLOTE'S SONG 'BOYS LIKE BOYS' OR HOWEVER IT GOES. KIDS, PUTDOWN SWITCHFFOT AND PICKUP A FAIRLY DESCENT ALBUMS AND STOP SUPPORTING THESE POSEURS. THE ONLY BANDS THAT ARE FAIRLY DESCENT THST KEEP ROCK FROM DIENG ARE JET, THE DARKNESS, KORN, SLIPKNOT AND SEVERAL OTHER BANDS. DONT BUY THIS CRAP. BY THE WAY YALL, I AM 14 SO NOT ALL YOUTH LISTENS TO BAD MUSIC."
1,Don't buy this CD,"This CD is filled with the pop hits of 2003 and 2004. Almost all of them are not worth hearing more than once. The only reason you should ever buy this cd is because of Switchfoot's ""dare you to move"". So, instead of buying this cd, just buy ""the beautiful letdown"" by Switchfoot."
4,A very good movie for it's time.,"I watched this movie back when I was a 15 year old kid and I loved it. I watched it again this year and found it very entertaining. The wild boar effects are a bit dated (but not really a deal breaker) but the scares and the tension are still right there. I dont know what it is about Australian movies from the 80's but they like to show their Outback residents as crazy ruthless rapists a lot. I think each an every character except the ""normal"" Americans could fit into ""Mad Max"" or ""The Road Warrior"" easily. It just helps to maintain an uneasy feeling throughout the movie, but I wonder if everyone in the Australian outback was really like that!Its definitely a disturbing movie and well worth a watch."
2,Didn't Look Right,"I like the idea of this bracelet, and it looked pretty in the box, but I didn't like the way it looked on my wrist. To get it to look right I had to twist it before the clasp was fastened and it was just too hard to do. Also one of the chains was longer than the others and the excess stuck out. I returned it."
2,Disappointing,"My husband is a native Minnesotan so I bought this for him as a reminder of the beauty of the state. Instead, half the program is about industry - taconite mining, ethanol, stained glass (which at least is pretty) - not what I would call a travelogue! I may return it as we will probably never watch it again, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to visitors. We looked at the other videos in the series, but won't be ordering them now!"
4,Public domain copies of some rare Joe E. Brown,"VCI has assembled three post-Warner Brothers films by Brown plus ""Earthworm Tractors."" I like Brown a lot, and his personality certainly carries these films, which for the most part are in the B-movie category in my opinion. Still, any lover of comedy and especially Brown should have this in their collection, or at least rent it to view them. The quality is fair - not bad really, but no real restoration seems to have been made here (in fact ""The Gladiator"" was taken from a 16mm print released by Nu-Art Films). In spite of the lack of real bonus material (though the bios are nice references), the movies contain little gems of routines in them sprinkled here and there. I might have given it three stars if it weren't for Brown's performances, otherwise the quality of both the copies and the original productions is just fair."
4,Glad that this is available,"If you already know about Joe E. Brown, you already know why you should get this. If you have never seen any of his movies, but like things like old classic comedies, then this is for you! He can make just about anything funny."
4,The Black Prince,"This book by Bernard Aquina Doctor gives a nice history of Malcom X, a black leader of the 60's. A leader of the Black Muslims as well as the Black Rights movement alongside (and many times seemingly against) Martin KLuther King Jr. Aquinas lays the ground work by discussing Malcoms childhood, who his father was which would prove to be pivotal later in Malcom's life. Growing up poor and oppressed by the WW2 and the KKK among others, Malcom fought his way to the top and demanded to be heard by all. He was shot and killed at one of his lectures by one of the Black Muslims in 1965. Reccomended for those interested in Malcom X's ideas, as well as those curious about the black movement and some philosophies that went with it."
4,Used but usable - A must have!,"The work book is a great help when reading the corresponding book. My mind was full of so much information and reviewing so many ideas that it necessitated writing it down at the moment I thought it, while reading the book. The work book also helps to steer you into an better thought plan, to organize your thinking and get it down on paper. Buy it and use it! The buy an extra workbook because you ARE going to want to share the book, but will NOT want to share your private thoughts in YOUR workbook!"
5,Love is a Choice Workbook,I was surprised at the very fast delivery and very happy with the great price! The book was in great condition just like I was told it would be! Thanks so much!
4,Not too bad if.....,....you are new to the codependency scene. I have been working on this issue for quite a while so I found it to be a little basic.I would recommend if you're new to this those :)
4,Female Domination,"Mikesch and Treut's first film, Verfuhrung: Die Grausame Frau (Seduction: The Cruel Woman, 1985) was inspired by the novel Venus in Furs by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Seduction examines the psychological aspects of sadism and masochism through the tale of Wanda (Mechthild Grossmann), a German lesbian dominatrix who runs a gallery where audiences pay for the privilege of watching her humiliate her slaves."
5,I have this on cassette in near mint condition.,If anyone is interested contact my ebay id: nuso.I wont charge $50.
5,This is a classic for me,I love this CD; it is one of my favorite to work out with. This was the best they did. Nothing else they've done can meet the standards of this CD.E Sweeney Cleveland OH.
5,DAmmit,I love this cd but the more i see people raisig prices for a copy the more i dont want to get itThis cd is ATL at its best Kalifornia is a dope song and black super manburn a copy until it gets reprinted
4,Solid Release,"A pretty storng release from copywirte and the O.D.O.T crew. Much like the weatherman release. They spit some strong and crazy lines over some very familar beats. They all shine on these tracks, I espeaciiallt enjoyed tagre kingDom and Jakki. The only reason I gave this a four is because of the couple of sappy choruses and commercial beats that the Rockafella produces did on this mixtape. Enjoy copywrite now because if he sticks with rockafella hell be just another MTV rapper with subdued rhymes and stupid choruses"
4,WoRd uP!!!,"Copywrite a very skilled MC (punchline flows) going off on every fake rapper out there. (His featuring artist bring it as well) Its not all punchlines, you get some intricate flows and storytellin' as well."
1,wtf is this..,this is painfully bad.. everyone who wrote a good review is probably one of copywrites family members
1,Another Ble Stained Carpet,I now have a carpet that has been tinted blue. I have tried for hours to take it out.
4,Delicious Comedy,"Dennis O'Keefe will do anything to keep his ultra-jealous bride from discovering a frilly pink slip he had given to Gail Patrick (Mabel) on a Mexican Holiday. Complications ensue as others get wind of a slip in Mexico and naturally conclude our hero has made a false step. O'Keefe has to keep one step ahead of his wife and two steps ahead of Mabel, who wants to bring everything out in the open before her upcoming marriage. O'Keefe, Patrick, Misha Auer, and Charlotte Greenwood are in fine form as the laughs come fast and furious."
1,"Another ""Oldie,but Goodie""!","I have watched this treasure 5 times since it arrived, I still get laughs each time. I think Dick Van Dyke must have watched some of Dennis O'Keefe moves, as he reminds this viewer of him. Good movie to watch on a cold and wintry night !"
3,Nostalgic,"This movie, though scandalous in its time, was full of cheezy humor and slapstick. I purchased this movie for my 78 year old mother who has memories of seeing it on ""the big screen"" with her mother. All she could remember was the title and grandma, a normally conservative woman, laughed so hard she had tears rolling down her cheeks (and she was the preacher's wife!). If you have an older family member that might enjoy a trip back in time, I would highly recommend purchasing this movie."
2,Zoom gone mad!,"I bought the grdx97 camera new, back in march 2005. This past month or so, the camera has begun malfunctioning. When turned on, within a few seconds of recording, the zoom automatically starts, resulting in a blur. I tried changing the zoom feature to limit the max zoom at 12x, but still, it zooms to the max of 12x, thus limiting my ability to film anything at home.The warranty is labor 3monts, parts 1 year. There is no customer service I can talk to at the toll free JVC number. Therefore, I have to drive to the nearest service center which is apparently an independent business. All of the service centers are > 30 minutes away.I never thought I would be having problems 5 months after purchase!"
1,Problems transferring you video to PC,"1) The provided with the camera Streaming USB Video Driver will not install on Windows XP. Read the p.8 of the manual. It will warn you that XP Hardware Wizard will fail, but promise that after four attempts, you will succeed. Guess what, you won't! XP will tell you that it cannot install this hardware since ""The third-party INF does not contain digital signature information"".2) If you give up and decide to go with Firewire connection, you are up for another surprise - JVC Firewire cable is not included and you might not be able to use another manufacturer cable (e.g., the one that comes with STARTEC kit sold by Amazon). It will simply not fit into the camera socket. According to JVC website - ""JVC doesn't guarantee that computer, firewire card and JVC camcorder will interface flawlessly in everybody case."" If you want to buy JVC recommended cable (VCVDV206U), it will cost you extra $$$."
5,A book of beauty and power,"This extremely well-written book gives us many aspects: a coming of age story, information on marine life, Indian lore and wisdom, and a type of mystery. The author blends everything quite skillfully, and it keeps your attention as you go along. This is a relatively short book, and can be finished in one, or perhaps two, sittings, which is how I did it. The writing is quite powerful, and some of the descriptions rise almost to the level of poetry. It is a sad tale at timnes, but ultimately triumphant. This is the first book by this author that I have read, but I know that it will not be the last."
3,Whale Song,"Easy read but not a lot of depth to the story. Disappointing after reading the blurb and expecting so much more from the plot. It could have been a very interesting story but it didn't quite deliver - I read for the sake of it in the end, just to get the story finished. It's not that it was really bad, it just wasn't really good. Despite the controversial themes and potentially complex story line it is definitely more of a 'teenage easy read' than an adult novel."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I was a few pages into this book when I nearly deleted it from my kindle. It is a coming of age book of a young girl in Canada. The clear and beautiful way the words were put together kept me reading. Well into my 60's, this book was clearly written for a much younger generation, yet this book held my interest and kept me reading. When I finished the book, I felt the satisfaction of just having read a book well written! No need for me to go into the details of the book, other reviewers have done that. Just let me say, no matter what your age, you will find this book worth your time!"
3,For Tweens,"I made the mistake of recommending this novel for my book group based on the terrific reviews it received online.This was a big mistake. It is a sweet story, but it is most definitely for the young teen market. The setting is beautifully described, and the characters are appealing, but it's predictable, and the voice is that of an eleven year old girl.It's a great choice for middle school kids.Maureen Neumann"
5,great book,"I really like this book . especially since I am from the northwest, great storytelling. truly depicted the whales of the northwest"
2,Definitely for Preteens,"The plot in this book is good but the writing was not great. I think the book would appeal to a 10-12 year old or so (which is perhaps the intended audience). The foreshadowing was over the top and made it difficult to focus on what was currently happening in the story. Issues the main character had were easily resolved in not very realistic ways but this probably would not bother a typical preteen. The outcome was predictable and though the book was short, I found myself skimming just to finish it. So not great for avid reading adults but fine for adolescents."
3,"At times achingly real, but the ending....","Spoiler Alert!I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book until it got to the part where her mother dies and her father is imprisoned for her death. At this point it almost seems that the book was written by someone else, the flow seems stilted and jerky and not in keeping with the earlier writing. Still a good read."
3,A touching story,"While this was a very sweet story, I felt it was really geared toward the younger readers. I did enjoy it - until the end. It felt like the conclusion was just an afterthought, and didn't tie in well. A very quick and enjoyable read overall."
3,Well written but something amiss,"When I got the book, I was excited to read another Cheryl Tardif novel because the last one I read, Children of the Fog, truly blew me away.I was intrigued upon reading the synopsis of a young girl, a tragic loss, amnesia, and a mystery. However all of these things did not come into play until about the last quarter of the book. After that, it was as though someone hit fast forward and raced to complete the book.That being said, it would be unfair to leave without giving Miss Tardif credit for exemplary writing yet again. For 3 dimensional characters with whom you can actually laugh and cry. The book flowed beautiful and you truly did feel as though you were experiencing everything with Sarah.Beautifully written....I only wish the mystery and excitement had come sooner and lasted longer."
2,For younger readers.,"I was not aware the book was for younger readers, but I would recommend it for that age group. It is beautifully written."
4,Whale Song,Heart wrenching and enjoyable all at the same time. A well written enjoyable book with ups and downs and information galore.
4,Touching,"This book held my attention and I finished it within a day. I understand that it might have been written for a young audience, but the story line is a good one. I liked the way the native American culture figured into how Sarah dealt with what life dished out for her - from the move, to the illness of her mother, to the way she dealt with her father. Touching on the bully situation was an added attraction in this book, though I doubt those problems can always be resolved so easily. That said, the book was written for a different time so maybe it could have worked that way. The only part of the book I didn't like was the foreshadowing. It took away from the book. I would prefer surprises to what this author did. I loved the characters - they were true to what you would expect. Not sure how I feel about the way the hospital incident played out in the end. Still liked the book."
5,Great Read,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. It was entertaining, as well as educational. I was sorry when I got to the ending."
4,A good book,"This is one of those books that is very easy to get into and hard to put down. Each chapter leaves you wanting more and so you say just one more page...and that leads to a book that is read very quickly. Those are the kind of books I like. The kind where I get sucked into the pages, become part of the story and connect with the characters. I enjoyed hearing the stories from Nana (I LOVED this character), I smiled as I watched the relationship build between her and her crush. I related to her friendship to Goldie and the bond they shared. There were many aspects to this book that make it so good.I found that it was a little predictable but for some reason that doesn't matter. I really liked it. I give it a 4 star and encourage others young and old to give it a try. I'm guessing you will like it as much as I did. :)"
5,Awesome story,Whale Song is full of colorful images and descriptive passages. Cheryl Tardiff brings her characters alive with words. The reader is thrown into the lives of the characters and shares their emotions. I would recommend this book to anyone. Read it. You will enjoy it. I promise.
4,Loved the setting!,A great book and lived the Pacific northwest setting as the background for this loving tale. I enjoyed the Indian stories as well.
3,Whale Song,"Kept my interest all the way through. Very well written. I would recommend for a good short read, and if you are interested in Nature and human feelings."
5,Great author!,"Started reading and found I couldn't put it down. As soon as I finish this comment, I'm going right back to reading it! The story is written so well I'd give it 10 stars if they let me!!"
5,One of the very few 5's I give,"I think 5 stars should be reserved for books that you will long remember, and that evoke strong emotions. This book meets the criteria. I think this book really should be classified as a YA, but enjoyable for an adult.What happens when you are a teenager, you are moved to another country to live, and have to deal with bullies, and liking boys? And a mom who gets sicker and sicker. I don't want to say much more about this and spoil it. So I will say, have a box of Kleenix next to you for the last half of the book."
5,Real Muthaphu**ers,"first off this cd has 1 of the best rap songs i have ever heard""Real Muthaph**in G's"" this track has the phatest beat and the lyrics are amazing even though he is dissin one of my favorite rappers (dr dre). this cd is awsome and mainly focused on dre, snoop and deathrow, eazy e has guests on this cd like compton boys bg knocc out & dresta, who backs him up in real muthaph**in g's. just think if eazy e was alive today Ruthless would have destroyed deathrow because of there downfall, but i think that eazy would continue his beef with dre and it would be today Ruthless vs ShadyAfermath."
4,The Godfather of Gangsta Rap's punch at the Death Row Camp!,"It's time to give this Compton thug the props he is due! Eric Wright aka Casual aka Eazy-E was the founder of Ruthless Records, he started this whole G sh#t, and there's only a few that show him real respect. This EP is pure G-Funk, and I'm talking the ORIGINAL G-Funk! The producers Rhythm D and Big Hutch aka Cold 187um are the true originators of G-Funk (not Dr.Dre or Warren G). The album is packed with gangsta lyrics, and contains the huge Death Row dis; ""Real Muthaphuccing G'z"" a bomb west coast track, with all the right elements. Dresta and Knocc Out are doin' their g-thing and Eazy with his razor sharp flow makes this one of the greatest rap songs in Cali history! Eazy was a huge loss for the hip hop community, and this album proves it."
5,187um Killa,"That one lil kid sayin eazy waz fake obviously u dont know ****.Every MC today the goes mainstream hires bodyguards to protect them. Itz not nu. Being 5'2 doesnt mean **** either. Suge & tha rest of Death Row are lucky he got bodygaurds or they probably woulda got sprayed up w/ that MP5 eazy waz carryin around. The Godfather of Gangsta Rap R.I.P. 1963-1995""****** my height dont fight""- Eazy-E"
5,CLASSIC,I purchased this in feb 94 and to this date real muthafukin g's is still one of the all time greatest rap songs........bottom line if for some reason you have not heard this cd go buy it.........
5,Off da hook,"This cd is the bomb, it has awesome bass and lyrics. The best track is #2 because I hate Dr. Dre and I loved how he dissed him on the song and the album"
1,He died of Aids!!,Eazy E was not a true gangster you moronic vermin scum! He was maybe 5 feet two inches who always used to bend over for the heads in county jail. Word has it that Suge scared Eazy E so much that Eazy had to hire bodygaurds like the chump he was! Eazy E died of Aids like a trick.
5,Great VAlue,"These are the best headphones you can get at this price point. The clarity is unbeatable and the best i have seen for under 50 and better than must under 100. Razer surprisingly excels at their audio equipment. These are great because they sound great at high volume with little distortion, but they stand out on low volume, you'll be surprised with how much you missed from your favorite songs if you switch from ipod headphones. My only warning is that the ears are different lengths, perfect for the behind the back runner style wearing but for most people use it is a little annoying, but the product is so great i;m really just nitpicking to call that a flaw"
1,It's been almost a month and I still haven't received my purchase,The title says it all.... It's been almost a month and I still haven't received my purchase!
4,Great to see a master's beginnings,"Granted it's not his best, but it's great to see how Murakami began. It definitely gave me perspective on the rest of his novels. And the shipping was right on time."
2,Not what you might expect.,"There isn't much information on Amazon about the particulars of this book. It is a tiny paperback about 6"" high x 4"" wide and 1/4"" thick with 128 pages of text. It comes with a thin dust cover. It looks more like a pamphlet than a book and was apparently produced for Japanese students learning English. So if you are expecting a ""normal"" paperback, this is not. If I would have known this in advance I would not have bought it.It is a Murakami book so it is most likely a good read as are all his other books."
5,A great RX for backyard blues,"Looked at too many garden books lately? Looked at too many books with photos of ""yards"" like look like Windsor or Versailles ? Well ,welcome to the real world,albeit a much nicer version of it that I can currently claim in my backyard. But , I have high hopes that I can actually use this book and accomplish a great deal .This small book is actually very nicely illustrated with color photos and with clear step by step instructions for all projects. And budget is not a dirty word! Enjoyable and usable."
3,ehh,"If there was a Sexual Revolution going on in the 60's, it isnt on this disc. Mostly boring and dry for subject matter such as this."
3,Somewhat pleased,I love the series and was terribly disappointed to find that it contained only 4 episodes - what happened to the rest of the season? I felt very mislead.
2,Defective Version Still Out There,"I love this series which I would certainly recommend. I would not recommend this dvd release however. I just ordered 2 copies of this from amazon only to find out that I received the defective versions. These have the first 3 minute prologue, before the opening credits, cut off. Amazon sent replacements and now I have 4 defective dvd's in my collection. I am contacting the BFS company to see if they will replace these and I may ask amazon for a refund. I am confused and this was a royal pain. Apparently, the BFS has released corrected versions, but where are these? Update: Amazon very nicely refunded my money, but the company that made the dvd's returned my e-mails only after some time. (...)"
3,"Great show, terrible price...only 4 episodes in this set.","Love this show and would give it 5 stars, but this particular ""package"" only has 4 episodes (2 on each disc), so I would not recommend it for purchase at this price. Thankfully mine is not defective as other reviewers mentioned! It was my own fault for not paying attention to the specs that said 166 minutes I guess...I just assume that when they release a TV series on DVD that it would have at least a dozen episodes or so!"
1,feel mislead,"Bought this item thinking that it was season 2. Season 2 is not available in Australia, so was happy when Aussie dollar hit parity and purchased straight away. Seems am destined to never own seasion 2."
2,Could use a better editor,"The copy of this book I purchased had ""A mystery"" on the cover. Now I'm no genius but if a mystery book is named ""The Rasputin Relic"" it isn't really a mystery what is in the bank vault. I'm not sure why the author dragged it out so long before the characters found out. It just made for boring reading. On top of this the characters seemed formulaic. A woman with a past, a cynical cop, a government agent with no heart, etc. Finally the ending completed eradicated any goodwill I had towards the book. I won't ruin the ending but I will say it is completely unbelievable.As a side note Hampton Roads publishers has a note in the back of the book that they are a publisher of books on ""metaphysics and visionary fiction"". It hardly seemed visionary to me."
2,Couldn't finish it,"The blurb sounded promising, but only got halfway through it as the author clearly cannot write female characters. I cringed when rhostok brushed Nicole's breast whereby it hardened. That was unrealistic, as was her attempt at fighting him when he was consoling her. If she was sexually abused and such, that would never have happened so easily. These details are frustrating and I couldn't continue reading."
2,Needs better research,"The book Rasputin Relic suffers from an unrealistic plot and is in many ways poorly researched, showing little understanding of things Orthodox. I feel the writer should have investigated Orthodox Christian beliefs and Saints more carefully. Church Slavonic script is easy enough to read for anyone who can read modern Russian. The idea that someone who could read Russian couldn't read the name Rasputin written in Church Slavonic is unbelievable. Having Russian characters talk about Saints familiar to the western Churches rather than eastern Churches seemed strange, and the use of Church titles and ranks was all wrong - for example saying a Patriarch is the same as a Cardinal, when the reality is that a Patriarch is of equal rank to the pope. The writing itself was interesting but one had to suspend belief too much to enjoy it. A bit more research and a more carefully constructed plot would have made this book much better."
2,"I didn't finish this one, I just got bored with it.","I've actually read several of this author's offerings and liked Authenticator and La Magdalena but this book began to drag on and on for me. I gave up on it and didn't finish the story. I did hand it off to my mother and she read it and enjoyed it and related the ending of the book to me and it was a fairly interesting plot. I just couldn't wade through to the end to get there.It wasn't horrible, I just lost interest in the characters along the way. With Authenticator and La Magdalena I cared about the characters and was willing to wade through slow sections of the book to get to the end to see what happened to them.This is a decent book, just not one of Valtos' best."
2,OK but not for me,"I ordered this book through the recommendation of a friend. I found it somewhat interesting and a little thought provoking at times, but it felt like a collection of New Age perspectives bundled into one. As my persona philosophy is based much more on the Law of Attraction, there was much information in this book that didn't resonate with me."
4,Memories...,"I downloaded this song a few weeks ago, and it really brought back memories. Of course, rapping like this wouldn't be as groundbreaking NOW, but this was 1995. One thing everyone knows but won't admit is that Bone solo joints aren't all that, but actually, Flesh-N-Bone was wack back THEN. His verse here was better than his usual stuff but it was only tolerable rather than dope like everyone else's. Still, this song is still good to listen to."
1,A useless update of an outdated study,"Nothing like male M.D.'s trying to explain the psychology of female sexual ""perversion"". Of course this ""study"" is riddled with sexist and homophobic observation behind the mask of academia. Completely boggles my mind why they even release updated versions of this."
1,"Melodramatic, and terrible. Don't bother.","I wouldn't waste your time buying this. See if you can't borrow it from your local library if they loan DVDs or your local video store, if you're that interested. It easily put me to sleep inside of the first 30 minutes, and my best friend confirmed that impression after he'd managed to watch the whole movie. After I heard that, I didn't bother trying to rewatch it."
1,MOVIE FEEDBACK,"I AM PRETTY EASY TO PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES.LOW BUDGET,HIGH BUDGET,DOESN'T MATTER.THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY 45 YEARS OF VIEWING.WAS TOTALLY NOT BELIEVABLE AND THE WRITING AND DIRECTING WAS SHABBY AT BEST.DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED BUCKS ON THIS LEMON!!!!!"
1,Boring!,"This is the most boring movie I have seen in long time, is like watching the news for hours,except that the subject doesn't change. you could easily fall asleep."
3,Movie Okay,In its original debut I can understand why people were so terrified. But now with movies like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Grudge Without Warning is not too believeable.
2,"Not in the same league as ""Special Bulletin""","The ""fake-news"" TV movie had already be done, and done better, ten years ealier as ""Special Bulletin"". Where the first movie took its subject, nuclear disarmament and terrorism, seriously, this cheese-fest doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence at all. They pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera. Not of it ties together in any coherent way and the ""make love not war"" ending reeks of junior-high-school sophistry."
1,This could be ranked as one of the ten worst directed movies in history.,"This movie is poor in every dimension. The most egregious of its inadequacies is the director's inability to tell such a simple story. Any scene of impending interest is killed; leaving the feeling that the director is trying to create a movie out of loosely related short vignettes, thus deliberately downplaying anything that could be mistaken for a plot. The only reason I finished this movie was because I could not believe how bad it was. I have turned off many a ""better"" movie. This could be ranked as one of the ten worst directed movies in history. Unfortunately, you can not rank something as zero stars on Amazon."
4,Good charger...the ISB cable is worthless for VX9900,The included software for the USB cable does not have software or drivers for the enV VX9900. Price is right for the car charger though so I am not mad.
3,Fiction and lies are forbidden,"The Doctor, Rose, and Jack land on a planet where nobody dreams or imagines and where fiction and lies are forbidden.The idea is interesting but it did seem like the Doctor rushed into trying to fix what he perceived as a problem before figuring out why it was there in the first place. Which isn't really out of character, admittedly. The end wrapped up far too quickly, with everything all fixed and finished within just a few sentences. It seemed like almost an afterthought tacked onto the rest of the story.Coduri did a fine job of reading and it was enjoyable to listen to. The writing and plot were about average for a Doctor Who tie-in."
2,Your taxes at work.,"The first half of this book is filler. If I wanted a book on mountaineering that's what I would have paid for. This Brit field officer starts a civil war against his wishes. He gets surrounded by the local hooligans and runs. He claimed he couldn't get a weapon. This is just one more look into the incompetence of the United Nations, and the Brit military in general. When he departed and headed for safety he left behind several fellow UN soldiers to get on with it. He then made his way to safety and was choppered out after 6 days. For this he was decorated. I don't get it."
4,great read!,Simply an amazing book- followed up by looking up Author online and he's doing so much nowadays. Look out for him on National Geo.
3,"Much, much too brief","This, like almost all the Millennium collections, is a mediocre collection which manages to include several of the artist's best songs, but leaves out about twice as many.Come on...a CD has room for eighty minutes of music, and these twelve songs don't even take up half of that space.Sure, ""Smokestack Lightnin'"" is here, as is ""Evil"", ""I Ain't Superstitious"", ""The Red Rooster"" and the magnificent ""Killing Floor"". But why include Willie Dixon's ""Wang Dang Doodle"", which Howlin' Wolf himself hated, and the silly ""Built For Comfort"", and leave out classics like ""How Many More Years"", ""Forty-Four"" and ""Hidden Charms""?Get MCA/Chess' ""His Best"" instead. That one manages to pack twenty excellently selected songs onto one disc (and there's even a ""His Best vol. II"" once your appetite is whetted!)."
1,CHEAP POS,"The product was poorley made, in fact it looked like something I would have made for a third grade art project. I think they used elmers glue and cheap staples to make this product."
5,The big job ( a kids review ),I think this book is about four children who want jobs and they find one. The two boys went to their job and found a mystery about somebody stealing jewelry. My favorite part was when they uncovered the mystery. I think kids 7 and up should read this book.
2,A GOOD book,"This book was very good, but I think it needed more action in it. It got kind of boring, but it was a good book. It needed some more story to it to."
2,Alex Richardson,I really liked Benny uncovers a mystery and I think you will too. Just take my advice. Don't expect too much excitement. I recommend this book to kids who like excitement and surprises!
4,DWL-1000 AP - Easy Set Up,"Using the DWL-1000 and DWL-650 (wireless pcmcia Ethernet adapter), I was out of the box and on the internet in less than 10 minutes using an IBM ThinkPad, LinkSys Etherfast Cable/DSL Router, and cablemodem. I also have a desktop on the router, and have not had any problems, except for an initial IP address conflict that went away after I rebooted both PC's.I had hoped to put the access point in the basement with the router and modem, but the signal strength was poor (operable, but poor), so I had to move the AP to the main floor.Sure beats running CAT-5 cabling all over the house!"
1,Do not buy this product if you want tech support!,"I had the product for a couple of months. It stoppedworking. Then my troubles began.The one time I got through to tech support, the fellow on theother end was clueless and promised someone would return mycall who was a senior tech support guy. Never got a returnphone call.Tried calling back for an RMA number. The telephone numberthey give for getting RMAs was disconnected.I tried tech support twice more, was put on hold, forced to leave a message after 5 or so minutes. Still, never got a call back.In case you have got guessed, I am annoyed. This is not a product which a professional office can depend on."
1,Was great until the firmware update (2.2),"I had used this device without a problem for a year. I upgraded the firmware on this device a couple of weeks ago to version 2.2. I now cannot download a 5MB file without it dropping its connection 10+ times. It has become completely unusable.I just got of the phone with D-Link technical support. I am not joking, the gentleman on the other end told me that I had ""fried"" my card upgrading the firmware. I was angry that he used the words that ""I"" had fried it and I clarified with him. He said multiple times ""Yes, the firmware fried the access point"". To be completely sure I said ""You are saying that your software fries your products, is that correct"" to which he replied ""Yes"".On the upside, he said they will send me another access point. On the downside I have not received the email he said I would get with instructions.I don't think I will ever purchase anything from D-Link again. At least not until they can keep their software from frying their hardware."
4,Incompatible with software firewalls,"I have a Windows XP computer connected to a cable modem. I went crazy trying to install the D-Link wireless network kit with a 1000AP Access Point and two DWL-120 adaptors. The second computer, Windows 98, connects to the internet through the Windows XP machine. I hired someone else to install it. Finally he figured out that Norton Internet Security was breaking the D-Link network and now it works fine with Norton Internet Security turned off. I tried installing ZoneAlarm and that broke it also. So I've ordered a LinkSys hardware firewall to install between my cable modem and computer. I sent a technical support question to D-Link at some point by email and got no response."
4,Good product,"D-Link have a good product. It worked flawlessly with my 4-port Linksys router and one D-link wireless LAN card in my notebook. The documentation is poor. It's a good looking product and I plan to use it in my company. The price is also good, compared to other manufacturers like Compaq and 3COM. I can't also wait for the USB adapter."
2,Incredibly dry and dull subject,Don't read this book unless you are forced to do so. I started it many times but couldn't slog through it. Maybe some people like this sort of thing but I thought the book was worthless.
5,Fame and Randomness.......,"Balanced scorecard (BSC) has started as method, became kind of brand, and still serves as source of fame and wealth of those that well-promoted this managerial tool. Apart from methodical persuasiveness, randomness might have worked in favor of BSC instead of prioritizing Hoshin. However, managers that have ever had the chance to deepen their knowledge of and skills in applying Hoshin would never hit upon the idea of trying any other method the attractiveness of which is focality, focality, focality. Exactly, this is what makes the difference in the manager's life: Thrust, break-through thinking, and focusing on the essential.Benno D. Hoffmann"
4,Informative,"This how-to book will not make you into a screen writer, but it will help you understand how to get there. The authors cover basic writing topics such as plot structuring and characterization, and then move onto more advanced topics such as treatments, pitching, and the legal/business issues screen writers face. You'll find a chapters on specific cinematic genres - feature films, animation, daytime serials, made-for-TV movies, sit-coms, and hour-long television shows. The authors also include informative interviews with professionals about their craft. What you won't find is mechanical advice - how to format a script and the devices, such as the capitalization of character names, specific to screen writing. You'll need to study professional scripts and other books on screen writing to get those details.Like most how-to books on writing, this volume makes the path to becoming a professional seem much easier than it is. Still, it is a good book for the aspiring screen writer."
1,Successful Script Writing,"This is one of the absolute worst books on screenwriting I have ever read. It is obvious the authors just wanted to cash in on the ever increasing craze of wanna-be screenwriters. There are other much better books on screenwriting out there. This book spends a lot of time talking about finding ideas for films: If you don't have a story, why bother trying to write something?"
3,It's not wood,"This product looks good, but it is very cheaply made. The frame is not wood, it is contactpaper-covered plastic and the cork is very, very thin. I received my order and noted to the shipper that it was not wood and it came damaged. They replaced it very promptly at no cost, but with the same style- no wood. I have seen this same board at Michaels Craft Store at a lower price, but didn't buy it because I wanted a better one (!). Boards at the office supply stores are $40 and up, a board this size was over $100, so I gave up and hung this thing."
3,got them broken,I bought one and it came in pieces... so the company was nice enough to send me another. But it was broke too.
4,Manga_Mom,"I love the Doctor and wasnt sure if this new one could pull it off, but he does. Wish they would make a dvd of all the Christmas Specials instead of doing single dvds. Its a nice twist on an old theme."
4,Solid Christmas Special,This is a pretty good episode in my opinion. It's pretty creative and not as tacky as I was worried it might be when I watched the previews for it. It's a classic and I've re-watched it a few times.
5,Loving the new Doctor!,I enjoyed this ep and it was a nice little end cap to an awesome series - can't wait for series 6 XD
5,Lives Up to Reputation,"Once again, an intriguing, original, and visually exciting Dr. Who. A friend gave me this for Christmas last year and I love it! Spoiler Alert: Shop Amazon for your own Air Swimmer flying shark if you want to reenact this episode."
4,As a huge fan...,"...of both Doctor Who and A Christmas Carol I have to say I really enjoyed this version of the carol. Matt Smith was still kind of new to me when I watched this and this special REALLY helped make me more comfortable with his character.Also, while Christmas Carol has been done, again and again and again, and many parts of this special were not that interesting I did find some of the choices made in the production to be 100% correct. For example, the Ghost of the Future was a very interesting twist that only time travel could make work. The bonus features, Confidential and Doctor Who at the Proms 2010, helps you feel like you got your money's worth.Still, if you plan to buy the next season, all this is ON theDoctor Who: The Complete Sixth Seriesset, so you may wish to skip this unless you plan to buy it as a gift for somebody who is into Charles Dickens or somebody new to British Sci-fi. What better way to break them into Doctor Who than with a story they may already know?Enjoy!"
3,Respectable,"I am torn about Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor, and his first special did not help me decide whether I like or dislike him. The story is a modern retelling of the classic Charles Dickens story ""A Christmas Carol"". Michael Gambon plays the old miser, and his change of heart is painfully obvious from the start. That being said, he is still a fine actor. Matt Smith throughout is his same character, a bit jumpy and eccentric. Often times, it seems that he is trying to be too much like David Tennant, and that can be seen a tad in A Christmas Carol. The Sci Fi Elements are interesting, but theey seem like an afterthought. You never get the feeling that Rory and Amy are in any real danger, as we are just told that they are plummeting towards the planet. The fish story is my favorite part of this special, as it adds depth to the narrative. In summation, any fans of Matt Smith will enjoy this, but it was not to my liking."
3,Doctor Who Christmas Carol,"This is based on a Christmas Carol obviously by the title, in the Christmas Carol you have two main tasks. The saving of Scrooge and Tiny Tim in this Doctor Who version we only save Scrooge and leave Tiny Tim to die from some unspecified complication of a disease or physical problem. Also I have to quibble about the whole start of the story where a ship is about to crash and the Doctor needs to get the Scrooge character to cooperate to save the ship, totally ignoring that the Tardis should have been able to tow the ship to safety as he has in the past much less the whole earth. This story could have been so much more so only gets a 3 star rating. Matt Smith is to good of a Doctor to be left to such mediocre writing."
2,Is everybody here blind ???,"The special is marvelous, Good Dr Who show, i feel like a kid again, the extras are nice andi really loves the story.It starts like a roller coaster, it's witty, heartwarming, human, you laugh your head off, cry like a little girl, you are amazed by the originality of the story and the beauty of the sets, special effects and costumes and stuff.......annnnnnd the video quality make you wanna puke.Sériously, why going into so much trouble to doing something so beautiful and botch the entire work by filming with, i dont know, it must be a cell phone or an old Georges Méliès's camera or something.Come on, it's suppose to be a blu ray you know...what the heck is all this white specks doing all over the screen ?? And does them ever heard of 1080P ???They really taking the piss out of us."
2,"Flying Fish, Isomorphic Controls, Role-Playing, Oh My!","I am a HUGE Doctor Who fan, and I take my fandom seriously. But I found it impossible to take this special seriously. Normally, I'm charmed by Matt Smith's techno-babbling Doctor and Moffat's plot shenanigans. In this case, I was not. Russel T. Davies was the king of camp, but Steven Moffat botches this grandly. The special starts promisingly, albeit Amy and Rory's inappropriate clothing, but soon the story seems muddled and overdone. Crossing one's own time stream, which was once frowned upon, is used as a plot device, a shark is hitched to a buggy, and a woman singing, though the song is beautiful, is the best the Doctor can come up with to create resonating pitches to bring down a crashing spaceship. The performances are good, but the story is ridiculous. Don't buy it."
1,Missing parts,I purchased this Blu-ray to get the Christmas special and to get the Doctor Who at the Proms performance. The special was very good and what I expected but the Proms extra severely edited down. A review I saw indicated there was an extra musical selection but was present was missing all the classical entries and the opening number. This is not what I saw on BBC. What I expected on the disk was additions not subtractions. I found this disk disappointing and had to return it.
5,So Good.,"This is going to be my dad's christmas present, and as it's one of the best christmas specials (they're all super good, so they're all the best), I'm sure he'll love it!"
4,Great motivational movie for delinquent youth!,"I've veiwed and purchased this film for motivational purposes for many of the delinquent youth with whom I work. While a little preachy at times, the message is clear that change is possible for those willing to dig deep and aspire to something other than a life of crime."
2,The Phantom - serial,"The quality of the film was fair, the acting fair to poor and the plots childish but I must remember how old this serial is. All in all not a bad trip down memory lane."
3,Fast-paced and watchable,"I grew up reading Phantom cartoons. This video series shows a different Phantom. First, there is no horse named Hero. Phantom of this video is not as strong as in the cartoon. However, these are not major issues for me.I had a huge problem with the Professor. He does not care about his fellow men, only interested in his pursuit of the Zoloz ruins. I was truly disgusted to hear him say that the wealth of the Zoloz tribes belongs to his sponsor University! What nonsense! Even Phantom was no better. He realized that the jewels in his skull cave are the treasures of the Zoloz, but did not consider returning them to the tribes! In my dictionary, this is thievery."
4,An Excellant Movie Serial,"The Phantom is one of the better movie serials put out by Columbia. It stars frequent movie serial hero, Tom Tyler. It is an excellant serial from beginning to end. It does tend to drag in places because of Columbia's strict fifteen chapter format.I would highly recommend this serial to anyone who loves the genre. And, also, to those who are just discovering it."
3,Republic where are you when we need you!,I have been a Serial nut since I was 6 years old back in 1939.After looking for years for a Phantom print I finally found one with Amazon. Sorry to say I was somewhat sorry with this Columbia Picures product. In all fairness no one could make a Serial with the quality of Republic Pictures. They had the best directors and technicians in Hollywood. The Phantom I have is good with a very good story line. But the special effects are just not there. And that's what makes a Serial. Tom Tyler is one poor actor but that's his charm. When he made Captian Marvel I think in the entire 15 chapters he only spoke a total of 60 words. William Whitney the director once said that those few words were too much for Tyler. But that's OK for Tom I still enjoy watching him.
4,Quality Garment,I purchased this garment to wear for snowmobiling - out of the package it had a light weight itchy feel to it. After first washing it was very comfortable (which is same for every undershirt I've purchased). I am very pleased with it. Great quality - have no issues with small button holes/buttons. I've purchased other garments from this manufacturer with no issues.
5,"very lightweight, but comfortable.","This will come in handy this winter.ease of access was the #1 need for my spouse,these have it."
2,not what i expected,"union suite not what i expected. i,ve seen a few of these suites and the one i bought is difently the cheapest virsion of this suite. buttons fall off very thin material shrinks easy."
5,Not a Kid's Toy,"This is one of those items that isn't really for kids. It's for grown adult collector's (as myself). I collect these various NECA figures and display them. A kid would destroy this in a matter of seconds. As far as a cool collector item from the movie--great--and also a great Halloween decoration Oh, there are some plush versions of this which are kid-friendly."
5,Easily her most powerful body of musical work!,"I ""discovered"" Amy in 1982, at the tender age of 13, when her landmark album ""Age to Age"" hit the scene. Her 1984 ""Straight Ahead"" album was the first CD I owned... I have cherished her music and her influence in my life. I bought ""Lead Me On"" when it came out in I believe 1989 and was just blown away. The first song, ""1974"" immediately captivated me with its layered guitar work, and the title song is possibly one of the most powerful songs I've ever heard, speaking (at least to me) about slavery, the Holocaust, and our own paths in life. Amy's life bleeds through on this album, an effort I believe she didn't even approach again until her most recent effort, ""Behind the Eyes"". Now that news of her marriage of so many years ending has surfaced, one understands the melancholy flavor of this last album. Still, I think ""Lead Me On"" stands as a monumental work that could endure and flourish in contemporary Christian or secular music circles."
5,This is probably Amy's best album to date.,"If you want to only buy 1 Amy CD, this is the one to start with. Most people call Heart in Motion her crossover album, I would say it's this one. It's so full of emotion and it says an awful lot about what was going on in Amy's life at the time. It also shows her true Christianity and ability to forgive. Pay special attention to ""If These Walls Could Speak"", ""Lead me On"", ""1974"" and ""Alright""."
3,? New Buck ?,Not sure that I like these new Buck knives. It doesn't feel as solid as I remember but at leats it is better than the current release Old Timers. Nice and sharp but time will tell with regards to staying sharp andd sharpenability.
1,Too chilled.,"Sad compilation of music, not worth listening to. One of two tracks were passable but most were of poor quality. I'd recommend sticking with Buddha Bar series instead."
1,not a good cd come on guys bar de lune can do better than this,"cd1 (1,2)cd2 ()cd3 (1,3)a lot of fill unfortunatly to me but who am i to say i am only an expert unfortunalty loli real diappointednice place mats"
2,Misses the point entirely.,"Although this woman should be admired for how she was able to get back on track after the many things she endured she misses the point entirely. For starters, men who live ""on the DL"" do not want tobe discovered--in the unlikely event that a surefire or foolproof test to determine wether or not a man is on the DL were ever devised, those men in this lifestyle would find a way to dodge or evade it. Her suggestions that homosexuality and bisexuality can be cured are ludicrous at best. After having read this book my only question is ""Did she write this to get back at her ex-husband?""."
3,On the Up&Up:An PeoplewholoveGoodBooks Review,"On the Up and Up by Brenda Stone Browder is the response to the book ""On The Downlow by JL King"", Ms. Browder is the ex-wife of JL King and this is her story, her side of events. She talks about the DL signs and the health risks that women should be aware of if found in that situation. What I liked most about this book, is that she explains to those found in the same situation, is that it's NOT your fault. I think if Black America were more accepting of those who are ""different"", there may not be men on the ""down-low"". This is a story that needs to be told and deserves to be heard. Reviewed by Shay C of PeoplewholoveGoodBooks"
1,Proceed with Caution,"Read this book and respect the woman for her survival skills and ability to put her life back on track. But believe at your own risk her contentions that men can be ""cured"" of homosexuality through prayer and made marriageable to women. There is just no excuse for spreading that kind of ignorance."
3,"She Was On The Up & Up, More Than Mr. Down Low","When I read ""On The Down Low"", I was left angry by what I thought was a book made out of swiss cheese (too many holes), and I wanted to hear her side of the story. I was pleasantly surprised when I read the book, ""On The Up and Up"". I was glad to know 2 revelations from the book, that gay is gay, and the Lord is a waymaker.Whether or not you agree with her book, it was interesting to say the least. In talking with most of my girlfriends, this is the conclusion I've come to: If you liked JL King's book, you're really not going to like Mrs. Browder's book, and vice versa. This is a subject that has polarized people and should really make everyone think. The one thing that both books have in common is one piece of advice: trust your instincts."
2,Disappointed,"I was truly disappointed with this book. I read this book for my book club, along with On the Down Low, and I must say that my expectations were not met. She addressed some things J.L. King spoke about in his book, but not enough. Ms. Browder went into long tirades about faith and conversion (not sure I agree) and other things except how to help women who have lived with or currently live with men on the down low. She never explained how she helped her children get through it and it seems like she, at times, defended her ex-husband's behavior. I'm not sure who Mrs. Browder is helping to survive, herself or other women."
3,Boring!!!,"I thought the book was going to be more indepth as far as what to look out for, but it ended up being a book on her background. Boring!!!!"
3,+1/2 -- Soulful garage rock,"This band's version of garage rock is crossed with a soulful edge in the organ, dramatic vocals that bring to mind Hasil Adkins and Iggy Pop, and the psychedelic undertow of '60s stalwarts like The Doors. But this is hardly a retro exercise, as there's also a helping of thrashing punk energy in the tempos and general execution. Particularly compelling are the stomping instrumentals that bring to mind the roaring rock of the Pacific Northwest's Wailers. The band reworks Curtis Mayfield's ""Fool For You"" and Charles Brown's ""I Wanna Be Close"" a bit more loudly than the originals, and adds a thrashing take of the Motown rarity, ""Love's Gone Bad."" Fans of retro bands like The Black Lips, or the band's ancestral predecessors (Mr. Airplane Man, King of Nuthin') should check this out.3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"After seeing this movie on the LifeTime (AKA: Women's Channel) I wish I never saw this movie. This movie is soo unbelievible and very cheesy. Its one of those, ""it can't it get any worse, then it does. . .""The movie follows a group of people as they try to escape from flood water during a dam clopase. One of this people is an espaced killer. Of course, during their climb the killer shots the designer of the mall (who just happens to be there.) as they find a way to roof. Then they must shut off all elctrical equipement otherwise the methane gas despoists under the mall will explosed. This movie is soo horrible."
1,Bad movies,"This is the worst movie in looong time, is so bad that insults your intelligence, a whole bunch of people kept hostage by one guy who gives them countless chances to overpower him and yet no one does anything to free themselves."
5,Timeless and Unforgettable,"Truly an amazing piece of work, this record is a must for anyone who really likes music. It defies categorization and time, and demands listen after listen. I've had this one for over 10 years; it grabbed me from the very beginning and has never let go. I don't want it to let go."
5,"The best CD of the last 20 years, hands down","Seventeen years after I first heard the lead track from this album, it still rocks out. There is no other CD in my collection to which I return again and again, pleasantly surprised each time by how well this music has held up. The sheer originality and vibrancy of composition, lyrics and vocals remain unmatched even now. Mssrs. Baerwald and Ricketts achieved a once in a lifetime brilliance with Boomtown - so while it's true that there's only one David + David album, it is a single point of near-perfection whose very existence is cause enough for joy."
5,nice,a warm fuzzy from a younger Me.this is just as I remembered it.My wife loved it too.We danced to it.
5,Ten years and still moves me.,"I first picked up this album after hearing Boomtown on a college station. What followed was a ten year love affair with this disc. I'm on my third one, listen to it all the time and I'm still amazed that it never made more waves. Bedtime Stories followed up and left me wanting more. With the release of Triage I got it and more. These three albums should be in every rock lovers collection."
4,A Great Album,I don't know much about anything on this album. I bought the cassette and wore it out then bought another one. Great music...holds up better than most 80's music did.
5,Stunning!,"I have to agree with much of what is said here. This is a real masterpiece with a range of topics and textures. The title track and ""Swallowed by the Cracks"" were radio friendly in the 80s, but this disc is loaded with gems from start to finish. The lyrics generally address pains and struggles that accompany the American Dream."
2,"Over rated tinny, 80's music","I first heard ""Welcome to the Boomtown"" when it debuted out on college radio and made the video made it's run on MTV. I was intrigued by the atmospheric guitar and unusual format of the song. It's a good song that still sounds pretty good today.Years later, reminiscing about that cool 80's song, I elected to get the cd but, unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It's not that the other songs are neccessarily bad, it's just I find that ""Welcome to Boomtown"" has nothing in common with the other oversycopated, tinny sounding, overproduced sterotypical 80's fluff.This is one of those albums where the single completely outshines the rest of the album."
4,80's band worth hearing again.,This album is as good as I remembered it. I spent many nights listening to David & David in high school. The first five tracks are the best. This isn't bubble gum pop. Give it a listen.
5,Who said eighties music sucked?,"Well, for starters I have this item in VINYL! I bought the LP as soon as it came out, when I was a teenager, hooked by the two catchy singles ""welcome to the boomtown"" and ""swallowed by the cracks"" ad I loved every single track!!!Their ""dire straits-esque"" songwriting is slick and genuine, and their lyrics (albeit a bit depressing, at some points, with their stories of losers, crushed hopes and urban loneliness) are very interesting.On the LP's inner sleeve there also was an accurate Italian translation of all the lyrics! Not that I needed them but still it was a clever touch!Probably they did the same for the other European markets like France, Germany and so on...Highly recommended!!!"
5,Never Gets Old,"I picked up this CD because of Welcome to the Boomtown. After listening one time I fell in love with the rest of the songs. I like to listen to it to relieve stress, but you can also crank it up in the car. It is one of my top ten favorites."
5,Eye Opening,"A great read!! All the evidence for the arrival of the Messiah has been foretold and laid out in the Old Testament and explained here. This book is a delightful, eye opening, short read for non-believers and believers alike."
4,Moroso 63745 Radiator Hose Filler,"This item delivered as depicted, and it continues to work well after having to re-finish the radiator cap seating surface. There was minor warping and a slight ridge above the over-flow port, caused by the individual welding the item. I expected Moroso Quality Control to be better than that and catch the defect. Perhaps it was assembled/inspected on a late Friday afternoon. We've all had those kinda days. Would I buy it again? Yep, sure would; the price is right and it serves the purpose. Just have a flat file and some 400 grit sandpaper handy."
2,Weak on some topics,"The Men-at-arms Series covers ancient and classical China in five books, all by Chris Peers who is very familiar with the subject. This is the fourth book in this series. The chapters: Chronology -- The Yüan Dynasty -- The Yüan Army -- The Civil Wars 1351-1368 -- The Ming Dynasty -- The Ming Army -- Strategy and tactics -- Six significant battles. The text focuses on telling Chinas military history; it is very weak on topics like weapons or battle tactics. The drawings by David Sque are good. The maps are primitive and not very useful. American units of measurement are used throughout the book, which is a nuisance for international readers. This book is the sequel to ""Imperial Chinese Armies 590 - 1260"" (MAA 295). The next book in the series is ""Late Imperial Chinese Armies 1520 - 1840"" (MAA 307)."
1,Worst in the Chinese History series,"This book in a related series of 5 books by Chris Peers is let down by some of the ugliest illustrations I have ever seen in the Osprey series. Just look at the title page illustration! The figures are amateurishly executed, posed and drawn. These books are all about illustrations. The text is merely there to support the illustrations.Avoid this book."
1,Will fail in less than 6 months,"OK So Western Digital is supposed to be a good name. Well if you look on the back it says made in China. What a piece of junk. There it was sitting on my desktop when it just decided to start making that dreaded clicking noise. I babied this thing, never once dropping it. But hey, at least the light works.It's not even worth sending back even though it's under warranty because I have sensitive data that I wouldn't trust those people with it. And people wonder why China is doing so well."
1,Did not function as expected,"The Maxtor OneTouch iii - Mini Edition did not function as expected. It doesn't backup system files (neither the Windows folder), nor make an image of the notebook's hard-drive. Maxtor wasn't very specific about all it can really do in their webpage.The software which comes with it, is really poor, and offers almost the same that i can already do in Windows with 4 or 5 batch commands and schedule.I do not recommend."
1,The worst!! Dont but this item. it stinks.,I have tried to use the Maxtor III for about four years. It is not useable. Cannot get myu system to recogneise the drive. Supprot is the worst. DO NOT BUY... that is miy message.
1,Save your money.,"I am a Fordham alumnus (FCO '70). If the accuracy of Mr. Schroth's account of William Arnone is any indication of the degree of accuracy in the rest of the book, then I would say that Mr. Schroth has authored a most interesting work. . . of fiction!"
4,The History of a great American Institution,Fordham is a special place to many. This memoir provides the background and history of a wonderful university.
2,Pound around,"2 1/2Fun-ish spazzcore drum and bass delivers throbbing, similar-sounding ear candy in spades but unfortunately becomes too repetitious as an LP from its lack of melody, making this a choice expressly for rough tech-heads."
5,Excelent Stuff from Oz,Beautiful jazzy record. Sit back and chill out. A great Australian discovery for me!
2,be aware,"I received the speakers only couple days after purchased online, that was awesome delivery service.however, the speakers don't work the way I expected them to, first of all the sound quality is not good at all, and there's no way to adjust to make it sound better, secondly, my lap top have problem recognizing the speakers, sometime there's no sound at all, every time that happened I had to re-boot my laptop, I have window XP home version.I wouldn't recommend the product."
1,mistake,"i cancelled this item. i hope i wasn't charged. i do not get the bll, so i have no way of knowing. can you check?"
2,Very unstable as an eSATA drive,"Bought this drive to stream large orchestral music samples. The consistent transfer rate of Firewire was attractive, but I had the option of going for the 2GB rate of eSATA, so I bought this drive.Samples would not stream properly, if they could be found at all. The drive would spin up and spin down every few minutes. Nothing I did and no settings I changed could get this drive to work properly as eSATA. I believe for a while that it was the problem of Windows Vista, but that turned out to not be true.Since that time, I've had to use this as just another external USB drive. Not for my intended purpose at all. If you need eSATA, I suggest Seagate."
4,Good book,"Very interesting book. It is worth reading, but a quite high level is recommended to really appreciate it. In any case, the accompanying CD is great; you will really feel like playing with a small jazz ensemble."
5,I Wish I could Breathe again,"""All That Jazz,"" is still one of my all time favorite albums. I originally purchased the tape in the late 80s, and have been trying to find it on CD. From top to bottom the tracks can make believers in the passion of love out of anyone. Some compare them to Wham, but I must say that they created a niche of their own. ""All That Jazz"" still floats on the airwaves mainly with the soulful ""Hands to Heaven"", and ""How Can I Fall,"" two songs that still pull at the heart cords. This is easily one of the better albums to leave a mark on the 80s."
5,All That Jazz versus Piece of Mind,"I have both albums by Breathe. My opinion is that ""All That Jazz"" is a more complete and listenable work. ""Piece of Mind"" lacks the stylishness of the former. Nonetheless I was amazed to find a copy of ""Piece"" at of all places, the Greyhound Bus station in Cleveland, Ohio. ""Say A Prayer"" is a great track to move one's feet to. But nothing tops ""All That Jazz"", ""Hands To Heaven"" and ""How Can I Fall"" as examples of the range of songs that Breathe is capable of delighting the listener with."
1,i don't like it.,"i don't know what other people found in this cd. aside from ""hands to heaven"", i don't like the cd. sorry..."
4,"Great debut, but check out their second.","All That Jazz is a great debut CD from Breathe. ""Hands To Heaven"" and ""How Can I Fall?"" are great pop songs from the '80's. But what I like most about this group is the jazz elements in their songs. What I can't figure is where have they gone? Their follow up, ""Piece of Mind"", is a great testament to their maturity in the early '90's from a typical pop group of the '80's to a mix of pop, jazz, and blues. ""Piece of Mind"" might be hard to find (Amazon does not list it), but it is well worth getting."
3,Hands to Heaven,"Purchased this for Hands to Heaven, I like 3 songs on here. Dont buy unless you have to have a particular song."
4,A bit let down,"It's a lucid account of some Gnostic groups who were active in the early centuries of Christianity.What I have perceived as a flaw is the total lack of links with the great variety of sacred texts which were circulating at the time and which were surely read and debated by the various groups. In other words, who read what? So, on this premise, it can't be considered as an academic work but, probably, the author didn't want to write for this kind of audience.All in all, it can be considered as a valid sort of narrative, since it's well written and flows smoothly."
5,Read the series,"I read this many years ago,[volume one [Far Seer]] and loved it . Gave it to my son who was about 12 at the time and he still talks about it - he is 26 now! [It's the only Si-Fi he has read.] When I stumbled across the next two books recently [Not sure if they were even written back then!] I was thrilled and bought them instantly. Devoured them in a couple days and was very happy. They are as good as the origional, and my son is reading them now and agrees. Excellent reading for all ages!"
5,"See, Canadians rule!","GREAT,GREAT,GREAT BOOK! One of the best science-fiction books ever; absorbing and endlessly creative. The ""history of the current universe"" is fascinating and well-blended with the central storyline; the psychological and historical theories created by the author are riveting. It's a shame the title and book cover are so bad, but it's what's inside that really counts!"
1,junk,"The product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam, they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1/2 inch. We didn't even bother to blow the thing up, utter junk, returned for something cheaper and better put together (we hope). if I could give this a negative star rating I would."
1,If he could write novels as good as he writes his own reviews,"It is a shame that he can only write reviews well as his stories are full of clichés, bad stereotypes, plot holes, and sadly lacking in originally(...)"
1,Beware the Sock Puppeting Author,"I feel compelled to add one more warning for people considering this novel. The author, RJ Ellory, has admitted writing glowing reviews for his own books using assumed names. I read some of the reviews for this novel, and it is hard to believe they were written by regular people. I encourage everyone to use common sense when reading reviews, and to make sure they look at some of the negative reviews as well. (Although you also have to be careful with those reviews because RJ Ellory has also admitted to writing stink bomb reviews for the work of competing authors.)"
4,twists and turns,well written keeps your attention . not quite as good as his 2 prior books both of which I would give 5 stars
5,my favorite author,"This one was full of surprises, history, twists and turns. Everytime i thought i knew where Ellory was going, we went somewhere else. Amazing!"
1,Nothing to see here.,"Based on these reviews, I was going to buy the book, but after reading the lastest ABC news headline""Crime Writer RJ Ellory Caught Faking Amazon Reviews""and discovering that he had registerd fake Amazon accounts and giving 5-start reviews to himself and one-star reviews for the books of the other authors he thought were competitors, I have no interest in ready any more Mr. Rj Ellory's books"
1,THIS GIRL CANT SING,"SHE GETS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOVE FROM ME . I MEAN LET'S KEEP IT REAL. THE GIRL CANT SING. THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES HER TIGHT RIGHT NOW IS UH OH AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE BEAT. WHEN I HEAR THE VERSE I WANNA JUST SLAP HER, SHE CANT SING."
1,Almost Famous,"I wasn't shocked when I heard this album by Lumidee. Everything on the album is great except for the person singing. I honestly feel that she has no vocal talent what so ever. I would have been happy with just the instumental version. I think she needs some singing lessons. Other than her terrible voice, I think the album was great. Sounds like another one hit wonder!!"
4,good mix here,"This is a great album with both danceable songs and slow songs you can groove to. ""Supposed to Do"" and of course, the first single off the album ""Never Leave You,"" are both great club songs with awesome beats. ""Breakaway"" and ""Go With Me"" or both songs where Lumidee slows it down, but the songs still have an awesome vibe. Check it out if you're looking for some hot beats"
1,Horrible,"If that's the case, I might as well put out an album! She can NOT sing! One day... maybe is she gets more experience, and some vocal lessons w/ the right coach, better songs, and better promotion, then maybe... JUST MAYBE, I'll be eating my words.. until then, it's HORRID!"
1,Disappointing.,"Although the summer jam 'Never Leave You' was spectacular, 'Almost Famous' raised expectations to an extent which the album could not reach.It has been promoted so well yet the material seems to fall short of its hype. The vocals are a little off key and the only track other than 'Never Leave......' which is worth listening to is the one featuring N.O.R.E.I was deeply disappointed with the content, espiecally considering her debut single was so remarkably unique."
1,What??,"Don't rate this album because it has bad vocals? Why not?!! What the heck do you think they put a ""singer"" on this disc for anyhow? If they bother to put a voice on a track it better damn well be a good one. This is NOT a good voice at all!Beyonce is horrible. J.Lo is wretched. Give it a rest! None of these people should have gotten a recording contract in the first place. Beyonce should just keep her self-important mouth shut and just be a model.Too bad Lumidee doesn't even have THAT option to fall back on!Sorry, girl... you're gonna be working at Burger King in about two years. If you manage to have a career in two years, it's because people have dumbed themselves down so much that they can't can discern quality from a lack of it OR you miraculously found yourself some singing lessons!"
4,She is monotone but the message and beats are the focus,"Lumidee is very monotone on all of the songs on the album. However, what she's saying is for WOMEN no man should be reviewing this album unless they want to know what girls feel and go through with relationships in this generation. She has good messages on all her songs and crashin a party is my favorite song on here. Not her singing but the word i can relate at least. mainly too the part "" you could like my style but don't copy...."" This is strictly for ladies. She has a good head on her shoulders. With a little more money,time, and vocals put into the album she could be the first teenage perto rican r/b singer around. Watch out for her. She got mad potential to make all the haters bite their tounges."
1,Off KEY?!,"Lumidee says she sounds ""off key"" in ""Uh Oooh"" because the vocals were originally recorded for another track. Does she know the difference between off-key and off-BEAT? I didn't think there could be another singer more tone-deaf than J. Lo, but I guess I was wrong. We should discuss lack of singing ABILITY before we talk about lack of talent! Maybe she can stick to just producing albums instead."
2,2 stars for the only 2 good songs on this cd.....,Who knew? She can't sing! Need to find out for yourself? Buy the CD and waste your money like I did.
2,"Nice beats, horrible vocals","I gave Lumidee's album two stars because has very nice beats. However, the hot beats do not make up for her horrible vocals. Lumidee has no singing talent whatsoever. She should stick to rapping."
4,Worth while,"The album 'Almost Famous' is the first I heard of Lumidee. I think this was a long needed record and vibe. It reminds me of the 'Summer time' by Fresh Prince...a feel good vibration from the song makes you wanna be outdoors and having fun. Lumidee has a very wide range ability on her songs you’ll find fast, slow, deep, dance, all kinds of tempos and the whole album can be played without extensive skipping."
1,I want to shoot my radio,I don't know how anyone can sugarcoat the vocals... she's tone deaf!I'm very open to various musical genres and styles... but the fact remains... SHE CAN'T SING!!
1,GOD HAVE MERCY ON THE LISTENING EAR!,Not worth half a star let alone one. Busta Rhymes what were you thinking! Two words. TONE DEAF!!
1,HATE HER!!!!!,"This is the worstest cd I ever heard.I don't have this cd and Inever will,but I heard it at virgin megastore justto check out her music.Lumidee's musicis disgusting and verrrrrrrrrrrry boring!Don't buy this cd you will be verrrrrrydissapointed.If you want a great rnb musicbuy Beyoce,mya or mis-teeq."
1,Can't Stand Almost Famous,"I recently heard Lumidee's album Almost Famous and after the first 5 tracks I had to cut it off, only because it sounded so horrible. This girl has no musical talent whatsoever. It even got on my Mom's nerves to play it around the house, and she usually likes most R&B/Rap that I listen to. I don't reccomend that anyone buy this cd, unless you're as tone deaf as she is."
1,SHE CAN'T EVEN SING!,"Her looks have nothing to do with the sh*tty quality of her ""album."" This girl is obviously a joke, and she knows it. It explains why she says, ""I got the whole world singing off key."" I hoped she knows that she also has the whole world throwing up from her tone deaf-ness. She sucks and i'm glad she flopped. You're officially fired from the music business Lumidee!"
1,what were they thinking??,I havent heard the entire CD but from listening to the first tracked released I can truly say that this woman only has a pretty face with no talent. When are music exec's going to realize that cute girls (or women) do not sell CD's with out any vocals to back them.
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I also thought Lumidee might end up being a 1-hit wonder, I had hope that her album would prove me wrong...and it did. She is one of the most unique female artists out there right now, singing and laying down rap lyrics on her songs. She even does both on the same song a couple times by layin down some strong lyrics then singing her own hook. I don't find myself skipping any songs on the album, and besides (of course) Never Leave You, some of my favorite cuts are Crashin A Party (feat. Nore), Honestly, My Last Thug and Air To Breathe. All the beats are hot, I find myself noddin my head to almost all of them. It's an excellent first effort and I look for more to come from Lumidee. Definitely not a 1-hit wonder."
4,Great debut from a true talent,"Yep..This is the ""Uh Oooh"" girl. Don't just pass her off as a one hit wonder though..there are lots of great songs on this album. Lumidee has a unique, melodic voice that is really highlighted on this album. She sounds great over ballads and up-tempo songs. Favorites include Honestly, For keeps, and Me & You. Overall, a solid first effort from a promising star. Worth picking up."
2,"So close, yet so far away.","Doesn't the music industry have enough enertainers who sing songs with banging beats...but can't carry a tune to save their careers? Lumidee is young with radio friendly songs...but this time next year, you'll be like ""Lumi-who???"" Pass on this one."
1,PURE TRASH,"... I love the beat, though. It's her voice. It's horrid! Is it just me or does ""Honestly"" sound like ""Never Leave You (Uh Oooh)? Maybe it's a remix with a new name. The rest of the cd sounds too similar for me. I gave this CD one star because it's bad and I don't think she can improve her voice that much more for me to like her. I didn't buy this album, I simply listened to it on the internet. Good thing. I would have wasted 9 bucks!"
4,Not bad,1ALMOST FAMOUS(9/10)2HONESTLY(10/10)3CRASHIN A PARTY(9/10)4NEVER LEAVE YOU(9/10)5FOR KEEPS(8/10)6GOWITH ME(9/10)7ONLY FOR YOUR GOOD(9/10)8AIR TO BREATHE(10/10)9SUPPOSE TO DO(9/10)10MY LAST THUG(10/10)11BREAK AWAY(9/10)12ME & YOU(9/10)13UH OOH(REMIX)(9/10)decent album.
1,Awwwwww I feel bad for her,I have to admit that I was shocked when I heard the rest of the cd. It uncovered how bad of a singer she is. Well she won't last here but she'll make money overseas so I guess I shouldn't feel too bad for her. I blame this industry for putting out pretty faces with no talent. They fooled a lot of people into buying this because of 'Uh Oh' but now the people know the lack of talent here. Now I understand why there's 121 people trying to sell their copy back.
3,I AM NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK,"Lumidee.....I am not quite sure where to begin. The album isn't bad...but not the greatest either. I am not quite sure where she was trying to go with this. Her style didn't change much(vocally) through out the album. There was not much beat change either....if at all. But i do comend her, she does have a style for rhyming...i feel she should stick to that....(track 10 My last thug). She is a cute girl...the cover doesnt depict that. I hope that her next album will be more rap....KEEP TRYIN'. (P.S. THIS ALBUM HAS SOME LANGUAGE....SOME MAY BE AFFENDED)"
4,Better than what I thought,"I see all the negativy complaints for this CD, and yes the second song on the album sounds similiar to Never Leave You, but I think she did a good job for a first album. It doesn't seem like anyone wants to give her credit that she is only 19, and this is her first CD. She did most the writing and that is what should be appreciated. Yes, her voice isn't the greatest, but she's still making more money then you. So stop complaining and take it for what it is. I liked it. It's a chick CD I can relate to."
1,This cd is very bad,"I can't understand why any major label would stand behind this.The music industry is in a state is emergency - no less - and this cd is another example of that.The singing is terrible and the production is cheesy and thin.It's ironic that cds like this continue to flood stores, yet the labels actually get upset when people want to download it instead of buy it. Labels need to become more responsible..."
1,Its Useful,"Lumidee's album has kept many a Coffee stain off my glass table, they should sell her album next to Martha Stwarts home wares. Coasters are a neccessity!"
