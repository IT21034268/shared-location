5,Works great on my grill,"I live in Des Moines, Iowa (harsh winters) so needed some protection for my grill. This is very heavy duty and does the job. It has pockets on the top if you want to keep grill utensils up there (I don't but nice feature). Anyways - for the price - you can't go wrong."
5,"Veranda Cart BBQ Cover, XXL, Pebble",This is the best BBQ cover I have ever owned. I agree with everyone who rated this as a 5 star product.
2,Read the reviews and bought it but it is not even water resistant...,"Reviews and price were great so I ordered one for my Weber Summit 600 series. Out of the package it looked and felt really well made. Fit very well on the grill after a bit of fussing to get it in the right position to drop properly. Nice looking on the grill and deck. First problem was after a moderate shower, there was water on the grill under the cover. No wasy it could have gotten in the vents. Shrugged my shoulders and left it on. A week or so later, we get several inches of rain in Connecticut, I take off the cover to cook and not only is it wet again underneath, but my grease pan was flooded and had poured greasy water all over the inside cabinet of the grill and onto my deck. Also, after a month or so of ownership, there is mildew growing on the exterior. Now I regret not getting the Weber cover. This one is going back to Amazon. Wanted to like it but unless you live in an arid climate, I would not buy this cover."
5,Best cover I've ever had,This is the best cover I'ver ever owned or even seen. It's a heavy cover because it's made to be usesd in very heavy duty situations. It completely covers the grill and has a draw cord on the bottom to seal it up.
5,Excellent BBQ Cover,This is a very good BBQ cover as others have previously mentioned. It's heavy and durable with nicely placed handles for lifting and positioning in place. The clips for securing the cover to the grill legs are a plus if you live in a windy place and the cover fits your grill size loose. The grill we purchased this XXL cover for is a Weber Summit s-420 and the cover fits great with some room to spare. The covered mesh is also a plus for breathability and keeping your entire grill dry when it rains. It even has a large zippered storage pocket on it!
4,Smaller size would be great,"This grill cover is very sturdy and would have been my first choice. However, it is not available in a smaller size which is too bad. I needed it for a Weber E210 and it was enormous. It's too bad that they do not have a 50-53"" size.Terrazzo makes a medium that fits the Weber right to the base and that will do."
5,Great Fit,It fits great and looks even better. It looks like a custom cover for my Weber Genesis barbeque. I have yet to figure out how to secure the bottom to the stand.
4,Fits Weber Genesis perfectly.,"Very nice grill cover for a great price! As others have noted, it fits our Weber Genesis grill as if were made for it. Heavy duty, good design, & tie down straps make this an excellent cover. My only wish is that it was available in more colors."
5,Great fit.,This is a great item for very large grills. It completely covers our grill and protects it against the weather.
5,great product,Very well made and durable. Perfect fit for the Weber Genesis E-310 LP. I was ready to order Weber cover because the Weber grill is holy and can only be covered by another weber product. I am so glad that I did not order the piece of crap that weber sells. I did have a weber cover for my previous grill and it didn't hold up. This cover by classic accessories far exceeds any cover I have seen or used thus far. I'm happy that I listened to other reviewers and went with this one.
4,Great fit !,"Excellent quality cover for outdoors. Pliable fabric right out of the box. We question the 'need' for a zipper pocket on the front on it, but ? ? ?. We are happy with our purchase, looks like it will last a L-O-N-G time !"
5,Above Expectations!,"After going through 2 different cheaper covers - each of which faded quickly and shredded in the wind, I finally came across this model and spent the extra cash. I can say without hesitation, that I was immediately impressed with the weight and thickness of material - very heavy duty. Additionally, there are nice clip straps that can be used to lock around the wheels to hold the entire unit down - in addition to the bungee cord around the base.This unit sits very well on my particular grill, so very your dimensions and choose accordingly. It also seems that this unit had a definite front side to it - some of my past covers, you couldn't really tell which side was the front until after you had it in place and realized it didn't fit.Anyway, I give this my highest recommendation!"
5,Classic Veranda large size Grill Cover review,"The Classic Veranda cover is a good fit for my Weber Summit Platinum Grill. Most important, it is made of higher quality materials than the Weber OEM cover. Our Weber cover developed rips in the seams within the first year of use and it cost more than the Classic Veranda. The Classic Veranda cover is made of a rugged nylon-type material which should last indefinitely with proper care.Great product at a great price!"
4,Veranda BBQ Grill Cover,This is a great grill cover. The Cheap Weber cover that came with my Weber Summit grill lasted less than 2 years. I almost bought another Weber cover when I came across the Veranda cover. It is heavy duty and looks like it will last a longer than the Weber cover (shame on you Weber). This cover will protect my investment from the elements during the harsh New England winter and through the grilling season. Great Product - make sure you check the dimensions of your grill before ordering.
5,Best cover I have ever owned,"This grill cover is the best! The material is durable and heavy. . . holds up well to wind and rain (haven't done snow yet). I love the way it looks on my patio. I am done with the cheap, black plastic covers that tear right away. If you have a grill worth covering, you should buy this cover!"
2,Torn already,"This looks nice and of high quality which is why I got it. Unfortunately it didn't hold up. In less than a year it has two gaping holes (2 feet each). Both of the tears are along the stitched part. It has just come undone. The last cover we had came with the house so I'm not sure how old it was before we got it but it looked old and not nearly as nice as this one, but it held up in our sometimes very windy yard for over four years with us before getting any holes and needing replaced."
2,Not Durable,"Bought this product in March. Initially loved the product- it was a clean, canvas look product which really complemented my patio and color scheme. I really liked the storage pocket too. Now that it is November, 8 months later, the cover is starting to crack near the top and leave gaps for water to get into. A couple of months ago, the cover also started to get mildew spots all over it so it is no longer clean looking. We do cover the grill after each use. The cover gets an equal amount of sun and shade during the day and we have not gotten a tremendous amount of rain the past few months, so not sure why the mildew or dark tiny spots started to form. No one is yanking the cover roughly off and on, so not sure why the cracks are happening. Very disappointed in this cover for the price. I thought it would last at least a year!"
5,"Sturdy Material, Sturdy Construction","Given the reasonable price I paid, I was pleasantly shocked by the quality of the cover. A comparable cover from the manufacturer of my grill would have cost 20-30% more. Even though this cover was less expensive, it is made out of a thick and what appears to very sturdy material.Time and weather will eventually determine how well this cover is made, but it already appears to be well constructed. Unlike many of the covers I have seen in big box stores, this cover is not just a canvas bag with elastic at the bottom. This cover is constructed of several panels of material which makes it almost form fitting around the grill. It also has clips for securing the cover to the grill as well as a draw string on the bottom.I will certainly check out other Veranda brand covers for my outdoor items."
5,Classic quality is always excellent!,It fits my Member's Mark grill perfect. Looks great. Detail to attention could not be better! I have 4 of their other covers and they they are excellent too.
5,Winter cover for barbecue,"This is a well-made, sturdy cover which fits our barbecue well in the medium size. The drawstrings at the bottom will help avoid snow creeping under it."
5,3 years and going strong!,"Its been close to 3 years now since I have had this and it is still working great protecting my BBQ. It has hardly faded at all and is in the full sun. It keeps the rain off and keeps it nice and dry. Its very thick and sturdy, well worth the price. Its a good buy."
3,Veranda Barbecue cover,The states it will cover a barbecue up to 70 inches. Mine is exactly 70 inches and the cover is very tight. You can get it on but it is a tight fit. I am not sure how long it will last since the corners push very tightly against the cover. Otherwise materials seem fine.
3,"Does not fit a 63"" Char-Broil Professional Series grill","While the overall length of the cover was OK, the fit in the center portion over the hood of the grill was not good. The hood is 33"" wide and this cover is narrower than that. The quality of the cover seemed very good and I am sorry that I had to return it due to lack of a good fit. It is possible that the X-LG cover (70"" long) would fit better, but I don't want to hassle with returning yet another cover if it does not. I based my purchase decision on over 1,000 positive reviews (mostly 5 star). I figured, if that many people with many, many different types of grills overwhelmingly liked it, then it was worth a chance. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."
4,GRILL COVER,"THIS COVER IS GREAT! MATERIALS USED ARE QUALITY. COULD HAVE BEEN JUST A FEW INCHES LONGER TO ALLOW FOR A UNENSIL RACK. ALL'N ALL A GREAT PURCHASE AND A GREAT FIT, LITERALLY."
5,High quality product!,"The quality of this product is far superior and, in many cases, less than or equal to the price of the covers that are made for specific grills. The cover fits perfect, super easy to take on and off, holds up to the weather, and looks great. Very satisfied with this purchase."
5,A beautiful way to winterize your grill,"This grill cover is the prettiest I've ever seen....not the black plastic bag type I've been getting at the big discount store. The medium is perfect size for my grill which is approximately 60"". Roomy, attractive with a lot of nice features. I highly recommend this lovely grill cover."
5,Great cover,The XXL Fits my Weber S-670 perfectly. It should have no problem keeping it safe from the elements as it appears to be a high quality cover. Time will tell.
5,Perfect for Master Forge 800 Sq. In. Steel Charcoal Grill,I bought the Large size for my Master Forge 800 Sq. In. Steel Charcoal Grill Model # MFJ576CNC that is 64.2 Height and 28.6 Deep it is look durable and well made .The color is great.Cover fits well.
2,Good for 2.5 years,"Good for 2.5 yrs and developed a 10"" tear. For the price and thickness of the fabric, it should last longer."
3,"Looks great, lasted less than 2 years before ripping along a seam.","I really liked this cover and would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that after two years (actually about a year and a half) it ripped along a seam while I was lifting it off the grill. It was during the winter so maybe the fabric was a little more brittle than it would have been during the summer, but still.The cover looks great and I was very pleased with it up until that point, but I don't think a year and a half is long enough for one of these to last."
2,"Was great for 1.5 years, then started tearing","This *was* a well-made grill cover and though the smallest size was too big for our grill, it served us well for the first year. After the first summer, it started fading pretty badly; the bottom color is now a purple-ish color. After the 2nd summer, I noticed tears on the top, towards where the handles are. Now on our third year, there are multiple tears and the ""fabric"" has become brittle and tears easily. For what I paid for this item, it should have lasted longer. Each time we remove and replace the cover now, it tears a little more. So, expect to only get about two years out of this before it starts tearing (if you look at other reviews, you'll see they have the same issue, too).We do store our grill and cover in the garage 4-5 months out of the year, too.Would not recommend. Will post pics later today."
2,Ok while it lasts...,"I'm placing an order for a replacement one right now, my last one made it almost three years. It is thoroughly destroyed right now, material has dried out and is tearing, webbing on buckles has broken, there are 5-6 large tears in the material on the top. Two of the buckles no longer work so the wind has been blowing it off.For the price, it was great while it lasted, I didn't expect it to last forever. I haven't found anything that I like better, would be nice if it lasted a little longer though."
3,Veranda Cart style Barbecue Cover,"I bought this for a Charbroil Grill and it fits perfectly, looks great, and goes on/off easily. The material is waterproof but it leaks. The side slots allow rain water in and I find water on the grill side table and side burner. Other than that it seems to be a great cover. It lost stars for the leaks. My grill is natural gas (it can not be moved for rainy days) on an uncovered deck, since I can not move it being water proof is important to me."
5,BBQ Cover,"Came on time, fits great over the weber summit 420. Perfect fit, this is for the XL size. Only had for a few months but all is well has rained several time on it and no problem also very windy the last few weeks and the cover hasn't moved. Way better the Weber's cover."
5,The perfect grill cover!,"Based on the product description and other customer reviews I ordered this product and it is exactly what I was wanting. It may help other customers to know that this fits the Ducane 4100 grill perfectly (height, width, and depth)!Quality is very good, the straps to hook around the legs work well (can't use one side due to grill platform design), and the drawstrings make it a snug fit.I highly recommend this product."
5,good quality,very strong and sturdy --love the handles so convient to take on and off !! would recomend this to others
4,So Far so good,This BBQ Cover held on with some wind.. We will see how it withstands the TEXAS hot summers..To be continued..
2,WAS good quality,Thought this was great and the size was perfect since we were looking for something to cover a large grill. DId the trick but ripped on the seam line within 3 months. Normal weather conditions...
5,BBQ cover,Best cover I have ever had. Has endured all types of weather and has held up very well. Would buy again
3,"Gift for her, she quit talking to me...","I thought this would be a good valentine gift along with the rocks and charcoal. Well lets just say we quit hanging out shortly after. It's ok though, I later found out she has issues so hopefully the incense will calm her down and help. I should have marched back to her place and took it back, that way I could actually type a review on how the product is but I guess if there not selling it then whats the point."
2,Plays like a demo,"This game has great graphics, but the courses are very short. Demo-version short. You won't believe how little space you cover before you see the message that you've gone another lap. Also, the AI is ridiculously skilled, and as the crafts you pilot are not that easily maneuvered, you're usually left in the dust. I wanted to like this, but I can't recommend it as is."
2,Make sure you buy a used copy.,You can find this game really cheap used if for whatever reason you actually want to buy it. The graphics are reminiscent of PS2 or Xbox1. I beat this game in 3 hours.
1,The worst xbox360 game I own,Someday someone will write the rest of this game & perhaps then that person will have a mediocre product. Until then we've got this waste of plastic.The only reason to buy this game is if you wanted to use its case for one of your good games.
5,Comprehensive and complete.,"Comprehensive and complete, well written in the beginning world of knots. Ultimately any skill of this type boils down to how much practice you are willing to put into it. This book will give you all you need to work with this group of knots, it is up to you to practice and enjoy the beauty and art of them."
3,Average Info - Disapointed,"Not much really here.. was looking for USEFUL knots like camping, hiking, etc. but these are just more generic.. nothing practical."
3,Ok For Learning To Tie From A Book,"I have gotten about 3/4 of the way through this book since my purchase. The first few knots you learn are very easy but once you get further in and the knots become more complicated, the description on what to do seems to get more confusing and less clear. I have had to turn to friends for help with a few but all in all this book is OK."
4,"good read, but...","A great book, with great color illustrations, some information about rope, and which knots are good for which activities or goals. The book starts off too complicated for me. I think they need to publish a ""Knots for Idiots"" book...that would be more my pace. If you're completely new to knots, like me, give up now."
5,knots,Excellent book on knots. His use of different colored line helps to understand the sequence of tying the various knots. Great for teaching knots to younger folks (Boyscouts).
4,Great Little Book,Even for an amateur these instructions are clearly understood. The size of the book makes it easy to carry along and practice knots in spare moments. Our son is the sailor and we hope to impress him with what we've learned the next time we go out on the SF Bay!
4,Satisfied customer,This is a great book with informative instructions. The pictures are very helpful and make knot tying so easy.
3,Not bad,"Of the five ""knot"" books I have, this ranks about in the middle. On the positive side is the excellent writing, the wide variety of knots and the inclusion of splicing. I was not, however, impressed with the inclusion of human hands illustrating the instructional steps. It would have been MUCH simpler to use directional arrows and shading. This would have allowed larger illustrations, and more easily understood steps."
3,"good illustrations, but missing some important knots","Bought this book for my course library (I am a wilderness instructor for Outward Bound). Realized too late that it does not include the taut line hitch or the trucker's (wagoneer's) hitch, both of which we use a lot. I would have thought those would be included in any good knots book. Ultimately replaced it with ""The Book of Knots: How to Tie 200 Practical Knots"" by Budworth & Dalton. Good illustrations a better selection of knots."
4,clear instruction great photographs good book for all,This book is good for all but it is great for first timers. Has most of the knots you could want...but of course not all. I'm still looking for a knot book to compliment this one. I've been looking at a lot of knot books and this one is a very well rounded book. If your going to only have one knot book..this is the one
3,"Generally good, but frequently confusing","This is overall a good book, with some interesting knots and useful illustrations. At times, however--more frequently than is acceptable--I have found the instructions a little too telegraphic and the illustrations completely mysterious. For instance, the illustrations sometimes seem to change orientation from one step to the next with no word of warning. At other times, critical parts of the knot are obscured by a hand of the person holding it. The descriptions sometimes give me the feeling that small but crucial operations have been left out, as if they belonged to the author's unconscious ""muscle memory"" and he never thought to include them. For example, it seems to me that it is topologically imposible ;-) to produce the Turqouise Turtle (pg. 52) following the the instructions and illustrations. You just can't get from step 3 to 4 without some missing manipulation of the rope."
5,Excellent Book - Machiavelli as you never knew him,"I picked this up from a sorting shelf this afternoon, and I am very very glad I did so. This book introduces you to Machiavelli's life and ideas, and then deftly compares his writings to contemporary and recent history. The ""running commentary"" by Machiavell is fascinating. It's opened my eyes to just how switched-on Machiavelli was, and how earnest and well-intentioned. I'm definitely going to be reading more about Machiavelli - indeed, this book was so good I'm considered changing out of science and into arts to pursue the topic more closely!"
5,Introduction well made,"I didn't really need an introduction but I got this book based on reviews given to me by friends. Glad I picked it up, it was a great read, entertaining and full of information, giving you insight and opinion, while at the same time, it reads like a small biography."
1,WARNING:this is NOT Machiavelli but leftist propaganda,"Less then half of the book is about the life or philosophy of this great thinker. More then half the book is leftist propaganda disguised as objective reasoning obviously intended to indoctrinate the novice - its intended audience. One example should suffice. Margaret Thatcher is made to say: ""There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families."" Machiavelli then responds: ""Nothing I ever wrote was worse - this is a republican nightmare and a sure recipe for social and political disaster!"" If you do not recoil from this exchange then you have already been indoctrinated. Quickly pick up John Locke or the Federalist Papers to recover. Then help the young readers of this book recover."
4,Good,"I was turned on to Ann Petry by accident. I first read the Street. I loved the book and could absolutely relate to it as a Black American woman. So naturally, I thought I should read her other works. I like this book. The story that resonated with me the most was The Winding Sheet. A black man who is abused by the white world and comes home to abuse the one he loves, becaue he is powerless. His anger and powerless doesn't make him strike out at his enemy, but the one he loves. I see it every day in real life."
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"This book is so poorly written that even a diehard college football fan like myself could not read it. The writing is disjointed and many paragraphs must be read several times to understand them. This book brings NOTHING to the table. There are few pictures and even those fail to illustrate the grandeur of these ""Cathedrals""The bottom line: don't waste your time on this book. Your money would be better spent on just about anything else."
3,Ok,This book is ok for someone who would like to know about various college and university football programs and their stadiums. I got to learn about the backgrounds of the schools included but noticed some errors about West Virginia University and Mountaineer Field. You wish the authors had either visited each stadium to see a game or got their research right. All in all it is a decent book.
5,"So, you want to be a Banking Expert? ALWAYS: Ingo Walter","I have met Ingo Walters in 1988 when he gave a brilliant talk to hundreds of CEOs form the Banking Industry in Europe. Everyone was amazed at how brilliant Ingo was. He is an authentic expert in European and US Banking. In his book ""Global Banking"" any serious student or better yet Strategic Management Consultant can learn Operations, Strategy, IT, Treasury, and Risk Management from different parts of the world. Highly recommended for Upper Management and CEOs of Regional Banks who need a pathway to easily transition into being a World Player. Learn through this book what the Managing-Directors at McKinsey, Bain, BCG, etc., would tell you for over 1 million dollars."
2,a so so book of the past from big name professors,a banking book covers subjects ok for yester-decade
3,Remixed version,"Be careful ordering this; it is the ""screwed and chopped"" version. This means remixed and slowed down. I guess the idea is to make you feel like you're on codeine."
4,"Good Soundtrack, Great Movie","I bought this soundtrack very shortly after I saw the movie in theaters four years ago. (I guess I'm slow to review things!) I still listen to it often and that should certainly speak to its staying power as a compilation of good vocals and music. Sinead O'Connor is fabulous. I'm not a huge fan, but no one could have done a better job, especially on ""She Moved Through the Fair"" and the opener, ""Easter Rebellion"". My eyes still tear up when I hear ""She Moved Through the Fair"" because I remember the impending doom in the film as it plays. This would make a good addition to your CD collection if you liked the film and/or you consider yourself a fan of Irish music."
5,An Absolute Godsend to Scholars of Late Antique History,"This book is absolutely fantastic. For all those university students interested in Late Antiquity, or anyone with a general interest in Gallic History.It provides clear, authoritative articles by the world's most knowledgeable historians on the subject.It is thematic which is fantastic for a period such as this, and refrains from boring facts and figures.Instead it analyzes the ideology present at the time, and more importantly the way in which Gallo-Romans perceive themselves."
3,Onstream SC50 External Tape Drive,"I'll keep this short. The tape drive is very affordable for what it does. As in other reviews the restore process with this tape drive is very slow. The performance is lacking, but for a home user who does have plenty of patience, this could work! I'm currently using this tape drive with Veritas Backup Exec. At this point the installation was difficult, but after a couple of hours on the internet surfing I located a website that had drivers for Windows XP and W2K. Of course, all the websites listed for Onstream were not working. So I'm wondering about the long term support of this equipment. This is definitely not meant for highend usage. You will regret it! Definitely for home use. I was a firm DLT Tape Drive user, and after my experience with this drive, I'm still a firm DLT Tape Drive user. But in all fairness, if your budget won't allow a decent backup solution, this will work for you for the cost!"
2,2 good songs... the rest is fairly boring,"Don't review many, but this CD is fairly bland with the exception of Brighter than Sunshine. If mellow ballads are your things, then maybe you will care for it more than I do."
1,You can only wish this album was as good as Jethro Tull's,"Now, in the history of rock music (or any other kind), did any ""artist"" ever get very far by stealing his/her moniker from a more sucessful album?Did you ever hear of Frank Sinatra calling himself ""Sketches Of Spain"", or Elvis ever going by ""Greatest Hits"", or the Beatles calling themselves ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band""? - oh, wait a minute...Anyway, my question is - couldn't this guy record under his own name? Isn't his music good enough to stand on it's own without calling to mind one of the best albums of another more sucessful group?I MEAN, HOW ORIGINAL CAN HE BE WHEN HE BLATANTLY STEALS SOMEONE ELSE'S ASSOCIATIVE NAME?Just because of the fact that I can't dis-associate my memory of Jethro Tull's masterpiece from this guy's name-dropping do I say:DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. IF HE CAN'T RECORD MUSIC UNDER HIS OWN TRUE NAME, HE DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE LISTENED TO!!!"
4,very good,"a very good album from aqualung aka matt hales. if you like coldplay you either love or hate this album. if you think coldplay is comprised of horrible musicians like me, then you would probably like this album. but this if u have a brain."
2,Yawn,"Boring. Plain and simple. I like ""Brighter than Sunshine,"" and I expected more of the same with the rest of the album. I fell asleep halfway through, so I never did find out if my assumption was true. Totally not what I expected, especially since ""BTS"" is played on alternative radio stations. The rest sound like Lite-FM hits."
3,It's good but...,"This album truly put me to sleep. The lyrics I will say are very good but come on the beats were so slow, and then finally an upbeat song, and then back down again. I was not happy at all, but at least this cd cures insomnia."
5,A Touch of Reality,This dvd is a window of what children must go through in order to find a level playing field in education when born into a life on the other side of the tracks. It's eye-opening and defies the stigma of poverty and laziness.
4,Charter School President,As I worked with a team to develop a Charter School I discovered this gem. If it doesn't bring tears to your eyes you aren't human.
3,Good For Starter - Some Improvements Could Be Had,"Concept is great, execution - not so much. The first two received had defective handles. In the first one, the handle would not retain the rod. In the second one, the rod would not release from the handle. The problem was solved when the 3rd one was received.The kit is also missing a patch holder. The jag is just a little bit to tight when used with a patch - I could not get a complete dry patch through the barrel - had to cut each in half.The overall length was also not long enough to clean the barrel for a Ruger Mark III. I ended up using another section from the 9mm Kleen bore pockit kit.A different customer was right, Kleen Bore could make some improvements to this product."
3,Not what I expected,"This candy is very good, but it is NOT the same coconut candy available in the Ferrero assortments at the holiday season. I was very disappointed in that."
1,Seniors I know have trouble with vision and hearing!!,"The yoga seems fine, but her voice is not clear and precise, and the colors on screen are very confusing: her clothing gets lost in the cluttered background.Since many of the seniors I know have trouble with hearing or vision, I rate this as unacceptable for its intended audience.Back to the drawing board!!"
4,Not really a greatest hit set but still worth finding.,"This CD is not exactly a ""best of"" collection-instead, it's a collection of 12 less-known hits and album tracks. It nonetheless remains a decent collection of Oscar's 1970s and early-'80s TH-Rodven recordings."
4,Liked this quirky film,"This was a wonderful, quirky film. I'm a fan of Sook-Yin's, so it's probably natural that I'd like it, but even if I didn't know who wrote it, I'd still like it. Cristin Milioti was awesome and quite a find!"
4,Year of the Carnivore...,"For me, this was one of those movies that I stumbled into while cable channel-surfing. It's funny, sad and it really does make you think. All she really wanted was to love a certain someone. However, facing rejection, her view is changed, and she goes through several changes before finding ""herself"" in a physical way. This is a person in whom many may be able to relate (in some form or fashion). I'm going to get a copy for myself to enjoy. Catch it on cable and decide for yourself, more good cinema from Canada!I rate ""Year of the Carnivore""...4 stars!"
3,emerald pendant,the necklace was very plain looking w/ a cheap looking chain. I was not happy w/ it and sent it back. The company took it back w/ no questions asked.
2,No enough,It simply had a narritive of just a few stories not enough to sink your teeth into. Also there wasn't any commentary or notes.
2,Go straight to the greatest hits.,"I shoulda bought ""Single File,"" the greatest hits collection only available as an import. It contains the uptempo ""Satellite"" and ""Ease the Pressure,"" the only worthwhile tracks on this CD. The long tracks are way too repetitive and unoriginal to hold your attention, and many of the shorter ones aren't that catchy, either."
1,Not the originals!,"Save your money. These are NOT the original recordings by Herman's Hermits. There are no liner notes, so I have no idea who it really is."
1,I'm not Henry the VIII I am not,"Second verse...NOT THE SAME AT THE FIRST. Not the original recordings. Money changes everythings!. For a few dollars more they remake (or destroyed) their own music. Music of the 60's, with the sound of the 70's, and the energy (closer to zero) of this ancient band. Uhhhhhhh. Don't be a fool, buy anything else, but not this CD."
5,Please suggest releasing on DVD,This is one of Dreyfus' best.Amazon used to ask you when you searched for a title on DVD if you would like to be added to a list where they would notify you when it was available on DVD. Every movie I have every inquired about in this way made it to DVD. Why is there not such a list for this movie.Is there a better way for consumers to encourage a studio to release a movie on DVD?
1,DVD doesn't play,This Sony DVD didn't play after the title screen. I sent it back and got a replacement. It didn't play either. You would think Sony could make a DVD that works. What a waste of time and effort.
2,A tax on one's patience,"If you haven't rolled your eyes in a long time, this movie is a wonderful opportunity to get back in practice."
1,very disappointed,I'm extremely disappointed that this movied isn't out on CD yet. I didn't look closely enough to notice that it was a VHS tape. Don't have a player anymore and no way to watch it.
3,movie - The Competition,"Wonderful piano music in this movie - I bought it to inspire my piano students, but was disappointed to find a bedroom scene in the middle of it."
5,This movie really should be on DVD!,"I just searched for this movie on Netflix, and I decided to come here to verify that this movie is really not on DVD. That is pathetic. The scenes where Amy Irving is playing the piano are great. The music is really good, too. Please put this on DVD!"
4,After I beat you I'll allow myself to fall in love with you,"Two finalists (Amy Irving and Richard Dreyfuss) at a piano competition in San Francisco fall in love, with Dreyfuss spending a good part of his (and the movie's) time raving against such a thing in order to keep his competitive edge. Dreyfuss is very good in his role as a self-consumed person ready to jump out of his skin. Irving's role, however, is nebulous and hazy and hard to get a handle on. The movie is well-acted - by the principals and the supporting cast (Lee Remick, especially) - but it goes on longer than it should, and it's all fairly predictable as well. Great music, though, obviously dubbed in."
4,A favorite!,"One of the movies I enjoy watching again and one that should be released sooner rather than later on DVD. Credible and creditable preformances by Richard Dreyfus as the pianist competing in his last year of eligibility - he does anxious and anal very well! - and Amy Irving as the girl who's got it all. Wonderful performances by Lee Remick and Sam Wanamaker and for that matter by most of the other supporting cast. And, of course, there's the music!"
5,Wore it out,"I have literally worn out my video of this movie, which I guess I've had for about 15 years - about time to replace it!The Competition has always been one of my favorite movies - combining classical piano concertos, somewhat-sappy-yet-realistic romance, and a young sexy Richard Dreyfuss (seriously, I love him, esp. his early work, swoon) as an abrasive yet charasmatic concert pianist.This is one of the few movies I can quote the dialogue from in everyday conversation, love it."
3,Not quite a three but....,"Richard Dreyfuss was really too old for this part and Amy Irving was not mature enough of an actress for this role (she's always been a kind of a stick person to me), but the story is the star here as is the music. The music is the reason I bought the dvd and I play those parts over and over. The rest is rather humdrum. I bought it because I liked the idea of the script and, as I said, the music."
3,Deserving the DVD Treatment,"A little gooey and mostly predictable, but Dreyfuss has one of the Great Lines of dialogue, summing up the desire for two to become one, without taking off a stitch. Can't get more romantic than that.Awaiting a nice widescreen remastering on DVD."
3,The Competition,"The Competition is a very touching , albeit predictable love story that pits Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving against each other in an international piano competition. It is one of those on again/off again romancs carried by sharp dialogue annd one liners. The chemistry betwween Dreyfuss and Irving is wonderful, and Lee Remick is outstanding as Heidi's piano teacher. The subplot about the Russian girl is not needed, except to provide extra time for the romance to develop. Also, why go into the background of the Italian if he isn't going to come in third? Dreyfuss' character is well developed, but Irving's character is not. Why is she so nonchalant about her piano playing? The ""piano faking"" is amazing and the highlight of a film with a romance that is like so many others. Doesn't it remind you of The Goodbye Girl, particularly the ending?"
3,This book is alright,This book is ok. But it's not that good. The practice tests are good and they can help you get ready for the test but their teachings and strategies aren't that good. It's hard to understand their book. I recommend getting Princeton or Kaplan if you're lacking math skills. Use this book only for practice tests.
2,ugh,"i suggest you use it for the practice tests, but this book lacks clarity. most of the lessons are difficult to understand and the writers often skip vital steps ""expecting"" their readers to already know them. im actually looking for a new book right now..."
2,Hmmm.....,"It teaches things the hard way. Explanations are not clear, it is loooooong, boring, could improve. I personally could not trust the info provided by the book because some things were wrong.Examples and exams are WAY difficult than the real test. This is annoying for those of us who get anxious if we score 440 on the practice test. Today in the real test I bet I got near 600, and definitely NOT thanks to the book, but to the unvaluable lessons of math at school.Specially if you are not American / English native speaker, you will find this book hard.I read the whole book and tried studying from it. In the end, I got nothing out of it.Men, I wish someone could write a decent Math IC Book, once and for all."
1,An Error Riddled Mess,"I recently began studying for the Math Level IC about a week ago, and after reading through 2 chapters, I am taking the book back for a refund. I [believe I]found over 10 errors in these first 2 chapters alone, and one of the questions [seemed to be] so messed up that there wasn't a possible right answer. I urge those who don't understand all about math already to stay away, as [I think] this book will only serve to further confuse you."
2,IC,"I'm still undecided on the issue of weather or not to take the 1C - this book is definitely not making my decision any easier. The tests are difficult to the extent of being fundamentally different from the real thing, which really defeats the purpose of buying a targeted prep. Book in the first place! Would you know of any other prep. books that are less intimidating and more importantly, more representative of the real test ? Also, how did your scores on the Model tests coincide with you final test day result? I trust there was a large disparity.I'm looking forward to a responsezubekpost@hotmail.com"
3,A disappointing review of Mathematics with notable errors,After reading and working through this book for the SAT Math IC I was left disappointed and frustrated by wrong answers and mathematical errors. Though Barrons is still one of the few decent math review books out there I would not recommend this book. Additionally after finding these errors you begin to question other answers in the book and tend not to trust it on topics you don't know. Topics you bought the book to learn. Anyone with fairly accomplished mathematical skills will be frustrated by the book. Personally I would recomend borrowing a precalculus textbook and reading it insted. (p.s. the errors were errors I checked with two reliable sources on a few of them and both confirmed the errors)
1,"old fashioned book, old fashioned tests","Last three editions of this book are all the same, buy an older version, or better, don't buy at all!"
3,A collection - nothing more,"Technically, this is what you might expect: all the episodes. No extra's, no frills. Even the subtitles (subsidized, for the impaired of hearing -wonder what MP would have made of that-)are on the cheap: all written in capitals. AND THAT IS NOT WHAT CAPITALS ARE FOR, ARE YOU DEAF OR SOMETHING?"
5,WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,"THIS IS TOTALLY AWESOME! BUY THIS DVD BOX SET RIGHT NOW!!!YOU WON'T BE SORRY, MY FRIENDS AND MYSELF HAVE BEEN WATCHING THIS FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS!!!!!!THE ONLY THING BETTER I CAN THINK OF IS A CABLE TV MARATHON OF THE REAL WORLD OR NASCAR!!!!!!!!"
2,A Must for Fans but Best in Moderation,"I remember liking Monty Python when I saw the program but I was never a regular viewer. I decided to watch the whole thing and ordered the set. Ordering it, paying for it and watching it all required effort.The set is magnificently done. This huge collection of disks contains all of the programs in chronological order. Each disk features 3 or 4 programs along with a few special features and trivia. This is how a set should be presented. That being said, watching it all took some effort.Many of the routines are dated but most can still produce laughs. This is especially true of some of the absurd setups and situations to say nothing of the animations. Still, I learned that the Pythons are best taken in small doses. The shows were originally broadcast over 4 seasons. I crammed them into a few months. I'm still a bit numb over the whole thing.This type of humor is probably an acquired taste. For those who have acquired the taste, this is an excellent set."
3,shipping,the product arrived in good speed and in excellent condition.i havent watche them all to say its good but so far ive had a laugh.
1,"Yes, it stands to reason that Benny Hill be much funnier than Python.","As already stated. People who are raised in show biz families very often do perform much, much better in the biz than folks who grew up in entirely non-show biz families and enter the profession only as adults. Much of Python's humor looked terribly forced and it was not anywhere as funny as it was supposed to be. Hill's show had far more life in it, naturally flowing humor and the timing was impeccable. Very, very often on MP the timing wasn't there at all. Python was a huge let down never matching its catchy opening theme song (which was pretty much borrowed anyway). There is also only a limited amount of Python. Even without BH comparisons Python was a real stinker."
4,And now for something completely reviewable!,"But funny.If you know Monty Python from their movies (younger generations), this isn't consistently as funny as what you are used to. At times it is hillarious but at times it is nothing more than strange.Well worth it, however."
5,Ministry of Silly Videos,"I think that this set is a great deal, even though it may not be completely complete. Its a laugh, and it has some really good extras. If you're looking for a good time and enjoyment to last a lifetime, (its lifetime, anyway) than this is the thing to buy!"
5,Fantastic,"I have seen all of Monty Python's movies and some of the skits. I LOVE THIS! And the best part is its the whole run, plus extras for a super low price!"
4,"Great collection, great price, mixed packaging","The collection arrived in excellent condition in a few days. I was surprised at how compact they made 20 discs. They are almost laying on top of each other, 2 to a page, with each page barely thick enough to hold the discs in, but it works. Only one problem: the cover of the main 14 disc collection is upside down. I couldn't get a message back to the seller to get a ""we'll replace it"" or ""sorry, keep it"" response. It's a nit really, but I keep opening it upside down and I'd rather not. The collection is truly enjoyable and my kids are getting an intro to Monty Python via the ""Personal Best"" discs and then selected shows. (The shows obviously have some less than ""best"" skits.) The price was very fair, in my opinion, for such a large number of discs, shows, and extras. I never have to go anywhere else for anything Python (oh... except for my already complete collection of their movies)."
4,"Great deal, great material, but incomplete","I like this box set a lot. The Pythons are still one of my favorite comedy troupes, and it's great to have this massive set of their episodes. That said, the marketing for this product by A&E; is misleading. Despite the packaging claims, some of the skits from the original episodes have been cut.I don't understand what led to that decision. I can't really imagine the members of Monty Python's Flying Circus going along with such a choice. So, I am very conflicted about the overall marketing spiel of this product compared to its strong comedic content. Hours of enjoyment and laughter, with a few bits missing."
3,The show is not the issue,"We all know the show is great. But why is the only available box set of it is this old, worn looking and occasionally crudely edited edition? Why doesn't the BBC put out a fresh re-issue already?"
4,All 45 Episodes,"There are a few things wrong with this set:. A word in an animation is changed.. Words are altered in the Summarize Proust Competition Sketch.. Some film is skipped in the Biggles sketch (and the characters change positions.). Two sketches are missing in Episode 38.Anyway, this has hundreds of sketches; The Dead Parrot, Nudge, Nudge, The Ministry of silly walks, The Spanish Inquisition, The Fish-Slapping Dance, The Argument Clinic, Spot the Looney, The Most Awful Family in Britian, and more. All the seasons have 13 episodes, except the last one which has only six episode and no John Cleese. The Show stars Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam (Who's not british and does the animation), Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin. Also some other actors are Carol Cleveland, Marie Anderson, Mrs. Idel, The Fred Tomlinson Singers, Ian Magnauhton, Rita Davids, and Connie Booth (Who's in Fawlty Towers with John Cleese.) Buy this soon!"
4,Don't Blame A&E,"This is a brief correction to Vlad48's review, ""Wiped Clean by A&E;"" -- Just to set the record straight, A&E; (the releasing agent for this set) is not responsible for bowdlerizing the contents. The programs here are taken from the US distribution versions, not the original BBC masters. These are the versions shown on PBS back in the 1970s, and in America ever since.I wish A&E; had used the original masters, or that the BBC would release its own set, especially with extended commentary etc., as other reviewers wish for. Censorship of any kind sucks, especially with material this classic. I rate it 4, not 5, stars for this reason. All things being equal, however, it's Monty, so what's to cry about for the price? 16 dvds for under $60 is a bargain--it comes out to around ten laughs for every penny spent. Snap 'em up!"
4,funny stuff,"For those with a particular brand of humor, these DVDs are a comprehensive set of laughs. I enjoyed them a lot."
5,PYTHON!,"Ah, finaly every single moment of my favorite show Monty Pythons Flying Circus is on a well crafted DVD. I recommend this to any one with a good sense of humor. I used to wake up 6:oo just to tape this... ah no longer..."
2,"Great, but incomplete","The episodes are great, and I have loved every bit of this set... until the final disc. Disc 14, the last 3 episodes recorded, was disc 13. I had 2 disc 13s. Much to my dismay, I cannot finish the series despite the rather high cost for the set."
2,Defective Disks,"First, let me say that when I returned the first set of Monty Python disks because some disks would not play, Amazon made it easy for me to return them, and promptly sent me a replacement set.But the second set was worse, with more defective disks. I'll find replacements for the bad disks myself, since there is no reasonable expectation of the third set being any better.This review is being offered in early October. If you want to get this set I would wait. Maybe it is just a bad run. If you do purchase them, check disk 10. It was bad in both sets."
5,#23....The Larch...The Larch. #24...The Spanish Inquisition,"What else can you say about it? It's the greatest show of all time. Before I heard of Monty Python, I had no clue how to defend my self against an assailant armed with fresh fruit. Now I know that not only will a tiger eat the foe, but it will also eat the raspberry's."
5,16 Ton Megaset Review,"The DVD's have bonus features like live renditions of sketches in the episodes, and in the box is an exciting colorful arrangement. In addition to that, there are the two live bonus discs, which are essentially slight variations of the more popular sketches in front of an audience (completely worth watching for the slight variations). The video quality is good and the DVD's run well.I'm too young to have known Monty Python while it was on the air, so I first experienced it through the movies and Netflix. When it went off instant watch, I immediately went over to Amazon to buy it. I was lucky enough to happen upon it when it was $45, but in my opinion it was worth the $120 they originally sold the whole collection for. The episodes have so much re-watching quality and it's much easier to force everyone I know to watch them now."
5,Happy as,I had been looking for this product for quite sometime and was constantly told it was not stocked anywhere anymore. I was stoked to find I could buy it. The price was half what I had seen before and the DVD's arrived two weeks earlier than I had been advised.All round an awesome deal and we haven't stopped laughing yet at the Python gang
3,Monty Python's Flying Circus - Collection DVD,"I bought this collection one set at a time as they became available and have not regretted it a bit. The only regret I have is that they didn't make more than 45 episodes. My advise is buy the set and enjoy. (nudge, nudge, wink, wink - you know what I mean. He said with a knowing grin)"
5,Intelligent Silliness,"OK I'm a Python fanatic, I can pick a sketch from one sentence. ""I'm keen to guess"" is of course from the Cheese Shop sketch. They are my Idols (no not Eric, and besides his last name is spelled Idle). Quintessential comedy for connoisseurs of intelligent silliness."
3,About the talent of the Python performers,"It was on one of these Python amazon sites a poster printed that the Pythons could not sing or dance well. The last scene of the entire series I believe has comely Pythoner Carol Cleveland trying to do a dance (and doing a fifth rate job of it!) in front of a bunch of men one of whom wears a mask. They should not have let these performers do dancing or singing. Eric Idle, a guitarist, sings about money in one ep and does a fifth rate job of it as well. Dubbing of these actors would have been better as no singing or dancing ability shows them up. I really think the Python fans need to mostly lighten up about this and stop treating Idle, Palin, Gilliam, etc like thy are blood realtives. They are just people on a tv show, stage or movie. They are not your blood relatives nor are any of them God himself!"
5,Monty Python-Timeless humor without vulgarities,"What can be said about Monty Python that does them justice-The funniest sketch style comedy material on video to date. There is a whole generation of young folks that would be humbled if they saw how much funnier these now old guys were over thirty years ago compared to some of the recent humor which relies on vulgarity and sex at almost every turn. Performers from The Second City and I.O. in Chicago modeled long form improvisation after the ""Pythons"" and the reincorporation style of comedy that was used in Monty Python episodes."
2,Python done wrong,"Monty Python is a British Institution that became a Comedy Institution around the world. The show has been greatly disrespected by A&E; in both versions of DVD sets they've released.I really hopr that someday either A&E; will redo this series to today's standards ((better DVD menus, extras (like the ones they apparently put on the 'Best of' Gilliam, Cleese, etc bits,)) yse slimline cases, a transfer that is both restored from the original and then touched up a bit better, both German episodes, the python live and life of python versions with all the goodies as well as some more extras which could totally be done. Do that A&E.; Or maybe some other company should buy the Python stuff from A&E; if that is at all possible and do the aforementioned because the inaction by A&E; is a disgrace."
4,My TV Past Comes Alive,"Too many nights as a child staying up to watch these things, hunting and pecking through TV Guide to find when they play. Ah, no longer. All in you easy-to-find package."
5,Love it!,"What can I say, it's Monty Python. Who wouldn't think it was wonderful. Saw these as a teenager and I still think it's the funniest thing ever"
4,"Great product, but buy the megaton set","Monty Python's Flying Circus is a Hilarious Show, and this box set is sure to make any Monty Python fan happy. BUT!!! Don't get this box set! Instead I recommend the Monty Python 16 Megaton set. It has all these discs, PLUS two additional discs of bonus footage, and it's only HALF this price. The only differences are that there are 2 additional discs, and that they use the slim DVD cases instead of the full size one. But this really is a great product!"
4,Great British humor,"This is a great dvd set of British type humor. These guys have their own way of writing and performing their sketch humor in such a way that it is very original and has not been duplicated to my knowledge. If you have never seen one of their shows, I highly reccomend watching one before you purchase this set. Everyone I know either loves it or hates, with no in between. I really like their style of comedy and have thoroughly enjoyed watching this dvd set. I am a college age student and find that it is not dated humor(things that were funny only in that time frame) and can be enjoyed by all ages. I hope you were helped by this review."
5,Something Completely Different,"This is a MUST item for anyone who has fallen in love with Monty Python. Everything in it is entertaining, even the packaging! So far, I have only reviewed half of the shows and this is well worth the price I paid for it. I have not watched all the episodes yet because I'm trying to extend the joy of rediscovering the pearls of what the Pythons did. I thoroughly recommend it to all you Gumbys out there."
5,Amazing!!,"What can I say about Monty Python that everyone doesn't know already? Comedy masters, brilliant!!"
5,Monty Python,The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus 16-Ton MegasetJust what my granddaughter wanted! Good price and fast shipping.
4,Python's shows plus some more,"I am not all the way through viewing all the disks yet, so this is a bit preliminary, but if you want to re-watch the shows, or introduce them to a new audience, this is a very good set of DVDs. The menu system is a bit obtuse, but the content is fine. Recomended for all who enjoy quirky British humor."
5,solo poetry,What a treat. Not only do you get to hear the dead's great lyricist covering songs by the dead you get the entire Terrapin Suite a la Hunter. Save your nickels and dimes and get a copy or else steal one.
4,Basic outlet covers,Just had my living room & dining room repainted and needed to change out my old and tired looking outlet covers.Rather than fight traffic and search for a parking spot at the local Home Depot i came here to Amazon and got ten for under 6 bucks.I broke one because i over tightened it but it was my own fault.They are packaged very nicely and have each one sealed in their own package.Overall a very good purchase..
3,An O.K. guide for the ASTB.,I recently took the ASTB for the Marines and came very close to passing it. The spatial app. was close to the actual test and so was the math/verbal except for the fact that their were 5 or 6 geometry questions on the ASTB. The mech. section was a little helpful but there were no equations you had to solve it was basically common knowledge. The aviation/nautical section was descent but because I had flight experience going into the test I was able to understand it better. I plan on taking the ASTB again towards the end of June. I remember many specific questions from the ASTB and if anyone who is about to take the ASTB or already has taken it feel free to e-mail me at albertdoug@hotmail to exchange information. Overall the ARCO is the best flight test book to buy.
4,Preparing for the AFAST,this book has helped point out my areas of weakness in preparing for the AFAST. now i know exactly what i need to study and which areas i need to concentrate on to improve my speed and accuracy in answering.
2,Not everything you need to know,I had studied this book for three to four weeks. I took a flight test for the Marines and found out that the only section that was similar was spatial apperception. Besides the spatial section there was about 20% from this book that was on the real test. If it was not for my experience in flying I would have completely bombed that test. I was extremely dissappointed in this book. I am still searching for something better.
1,"Buy the real one...written when she was alive, before 1947.","Read the real stories by the real Lucia here on Amazon, not the ones propagated by the Vatican straw man. Read links here: [...]"
4,Great Photography,"The wildlife photography for Silence and Solitude was commendable, but it seems that what these 2 men wanted was to just fly in and meet Dick Proenneke, shoot some film of him and the animals around Twin Lakes, and leave. Dick is a legend around there, has been for 25 years and was thinking of leaving for the lower 48 and these 2 photographers seized the moment to incorporate him into their film.Twin Lakes has been on my places to see before I die, but without Mr. Proenneke there the place will probably be a dump before I get to see it. Dick was always cleaning up campers and hunters camp sites of all the trash they left and keeping the place pristine."
4,Great deal!,"My dad watched a portion of this DVD on a local PBS station and really liked it. I purchased this DVD and my dad was thrilled. This is the second DVD in this series that I have bought as a gift for my father and he loves both of them. If you are an outdoor lover, you will cherish this DVD also."
5,Information about a culture I did not know about before,I am going to read this book several times. I have recommended it to my sons and my friends. The author is a dear friend now. A great read.
2,Appearances are Deceiving.,"I was looking for a good book on the relationship between Christ and the church as portrayed in the Bible as a Bridegroom and his bride, but was disappointed to purchase this and find that this is written from a Mormon / Latter Day Saint perspective on marriage, etc. I am not Mormon, so it was disturbing to me to see the many references to the books of Mormon and the Mormon perspective that is warped from the true light of God's Word. I would not recommend purchasing this book.If you are looking for more on the relationship between Christ and the church, I would suggest this set of short lessons called ""That the World May Know: Faith Lessons on the Death and Resurrection of the Messiah"" by historian / archaeologist Ray Vander Laan instead.Faith Lessons on the Death and Resurrection of the Messiah (Home DVD Vol. 4) Home Pack/Bible Study Guides: The Bible's Timeless Call to Impact Culture"
4,Fletch rules!,"He has done it again. Another adventure with Fletch moves you from your reading sofa to a whole different world. Forgetting the time, forgetting the space and only hoping that the next page wont be the last. I truly recommend this book to anyone who likes the fantasies of Fletch."
5,good,i found this to be a very good book. the story kept moving and everytime it began to wind down it lifted back up with another twist. never a dull moment. The character Vash the Stampede is more noble then one would think. it's an intense ride through the story as one reads as Vash risks himself time and time agian.Vash proves heroic when traveling on teh steamship and he sets standards for selflessness. not only does he risk himslef but he also takes on a child not so much as his own but to take care of in a sense. the storyline is excellent and it's improved by the cartoon format that it's written in. the pictures bring the book alive in you mind. it's incredible how this story can suck a reader in. what can be said about a book that both sucks the reader in and captures their emagination?...excellent.
1,Wrong fit!,"After trying to get this battery installed, I finally called RAZOR and they informed me that this battery will not fit and they sent me one free from RAZOR. When they say call RAZOR first, please do... it'll save you a lot of trouble. The new battery came in a week and was easy to install."

I would not recomend this particular brand of seal, your wasting your money.Joe B"
4,Fun!,"I rented this, curious about the movie (actually, I wanted Red Eye, but the store was out of those, so this was my 2nd choice). I figured it would be the stereotypical plot device where a criminal is aboard the plane, begins wreaking havoc, the other passengers are trapped, helpless as they die off one by one. However, I was mistaken. True, the plot has been done before, but the writers and directors managed to put in twists that made the movie very interesting. The device surrounding the daughter (I won't put in spoilers here) was choice! The cast was superb; did a very good job with the script. I can't say this will become a classic, but I can say it's worth the rental. BTW, it's better than Red Eye. :0)"
2,over the top,The previews looked so good. I thought I was in for a treat but this movie sucked big time. The first half was pretty good but the ending sucked and ruined the movie. I left thinking WTF was that.
2,This is just awful.,"An excellent cast, but plausibilty is stretched far beyond the breaking point. Disney should have kept it in the vault."
3,"See It, Forget It","This review is one big spoiler, so if you don't want that giveaway, stop here knowing that Flight Plan will entertain you for 98 minutes and then instantly disappear from your memory bank.Flight Plan finishes #2 (of 2) in 2005's Beware of Helpful Strangers When You Fly movie sub-genre. Its redeeming values are 1) brevity, 2) the ""where-did-they-hide-the-little-girl?"" factor and 3) Jodie Foster, who, superb actress that she is, carries this weak and not very thriller material. Its entertainment factor is how Jodie's part of the airplane seems half-empty part of the time and completely full at other times. What is this -- ""Musical Chairs Airways""? Also, the collective acting of the passenger extras, particularly when -- of course --the lights go out, is among the worst ever coaxed by a director.But if you want a really scary movie in this sub-genre, see the category winner, Cillian Murphy in Red Eye."
2,Flightplan,"If you think that you pick the plot with most movies, with this one forget it, it will have you thinking right the way through."
4,Better than you'd think from the trailer.,This movie was great. It wasn't too long. Kept you thinking and kept your attention. Jodie Foster doesn't look that great in this movie but fits the character that is stressed out and mentally a mess from her recently deceased husband. Losing her daughter on an airplane leaves a lot of suspense and really puts the writers to the test to write an excellent movie. I reccommend this movie!!
1,Avoid At All Costs,"All I have to say is, you know, you're in trouble, when you fall asleep, watching a thriller. I've read Roger Ebert's review of this film, and I normally agree with him about 90% of the time. This movie fell in the category of the latter 10%. This is a double-yawner. Where is the tension, thrills, suspense, and just a general sense of urgency? Nowhere to be found.Jodie Foster, as good as she is, didn't portray the ""mother in agony"" as strongly as the role should have been. James Horner's music, though bautiful, didn't fit this film. The direction and editing were not tight enough, to make this film even remotely interesting.All in all, totally uninvolving, and deeply disappointing. I expected a lot better material from this crew. Avoid at all costs."
4,It's good and worth watching.,I liked it but my hubby loved it. It's a tightly written thriller. A grieving mother and child get on a plane. Mom falls asleep and the child becomes missing. While watching Foster attempt to find her daughter I was thinking she's delusional and there never was a child. My husband thought she was someone more important than an propulsion engineer. That she worked for the government and it was some sort of government conspiracy. Which is it? Or is it something stranger? Maybe they are on a flight to the twilight zone.I'm not telling!
4,An OK Thriller Saved by Foster,"Kyle Pratt (Jodie Foster) is a bereaved wife, and a mother to a 6-year-old, Julia. Kyle takes Julia and the body of her late husband to America aboard a passenger plane of whose engine she designed. When the plane takes off, Kyle takes a nap and when she wakes up, Julia is gone. She asks around but no one remembers seeing the child. She walks the aisles, searches the bathrooms but still no sign of her daughter.That's when Jodie Foster unleashes her heroine, tough character on the plane, its pilot and passengers alike.The film deals with so many issues that have been brought on by 9/11, which I though was very interesting. Jodie Foster was, as she always is, flawless. She basically carries this film through. Sean Bean was awesome too as the plane's pilot.It's a good movie, all things considered. Go see it."
5,good suspence movie,This is a good movie. Very interesting twists and turns. You really wonder if the lady is crazy or not. Good buy.
4,"Well done, don't miss it!","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, it has it all; suspense, good acting, good story line, and without much violence.The plot is interesting, it keeps you guessing, and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.Great job Hollywood, to all involved with this film, especiallyJodi Foster!"
4,I love this movie.,"This movie has so much suspense and action and I love how the daughter says, ""Are we there yet at the end"" Definatly something to add to your dvd collection. I would suggest the fullscreen."
4,Well made thriller with some holes in the script!,"The first aspect to remark about this singular intrigue movie and psychological riddles is the sumptuous camera of this promising director.The terrible moments of woman in disgrace (Jodie Foster) has become widow and her only desire is to repatriate her husband `s ashes from Berlin to USA. She will fly with her daughter. In spite of the minimum valuable information, we know she is a famed engineer in Aeronautic Engineer.There are reasons to assume she has been termed the human bait in order to obtain Fifty millions dollars through hidden motivations that finally are not revealed ( and this is possibly its major default) a dense brume around the script that let the viewer unsatisfied at the end of the movie.Jodie Foster once more, shines with own light and enhances and enriches notably the different hues of this desperate woman in search of her daughter."
4,Fakes On A Plane...,"I've loved Jodie Foster ever since being mesmerized by her in THE LITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was the dark icing on the cake. Now, Ms. Foster has become a suspense / thriller / action hero. PANIC ROOM was great and FLIGHTPLAN is almost as good. Here we get a mother named Kyle Pratt (Foster), trapped on a plane, unable to find her 6yo daughter. Unfortunately, no one believes her, and there's no record of her daughter ever being on the plane! Is she nuts, or is there some diabolical conspiracy afoot? The tension builds nicely, while we wonder what is going on. Kyle goes from concerned parent to nearly berserk passenger to unstoppable super-mum on the loose! Definitely a flight worth taking..."
4,Never under estimate a mother,Jodie Foster shows everyone that a mother will do anything to protect her child and no one will get in her way as she plows through doubters and those in authority to find her child. This movie gets your blood pumping through her struggle. Movie arrive in excellent condition.
4,"very harrowing,but","i don't think it's realistic.plus,there are a lot of plot holes andinconsistencies,in my mind.but the acting is first rate from all,and ithad me guessing to the end.it was unpredictable enough that i wasn'tsure who was good or bad,until the end.plus,the ending was differentthan i thought it would be.and the movie is certainly harrowing andwill get your adrenaline pumping.the only problem is,i just couldn'tsuspend my disbelief enough to get around all the unansweredquestions.normally that isn't an issue for me,but it just becomes toomuch.despite that,i still give it high marks due to how harrowing andentertaining it is.for me,Flightplan is a 4/5.if you can suspend yourdisbelief enough,you will probably really like this movie."
4,3 1/2 star airplane book...er... movie,"This is an okay DVD to watch while not paying close attention. That is my secret for not finding the plot to be too full of holes. The whole is she crazy or the victim of an elaborate conspiracy plot is getting kind of worn on both ends ""Secret Window"", ""Hide & Seek"", ""Shutter Island"" etc.All good for a brain vacation, but they wont leave you overflowing with praise."
2,hysterical mother is vindicated (yawn),Jodie Foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end. The only mystery is in the details. No real suspense. I found the plot to be a little farfetched.
2,Boring,"This movie did not go anywhere. Where it DID go was not believable. For a better mother loses child movie, see The Forgotten with Julianne Moore (who coincidentally, took over for Jodie Foster in the Silence of the Lambs films). Also, the Others with Nicole Kidman. Skip this.Walt D in LV"
4,Much better than what I was expecting.,"Very good film. Good pace, action, and story. I can't give too much away by going into detail on the plot, but I will say that I thought I had it figured out, but I did not. Nice sense of dread and suspense, but -1 star for having to suspend disbelief."
4,Imagine that nobody believe in you....,"Haven't watched Judie Foster's movies for years after Maverick 1994 & Contact 1997, and the stunning performance of The silent of the Lamb 1991. I really like this movie even though I think there are some unexplainable flaws on the plot, but what the heck, just sit back and enjoy it 4 out of 5."
3,thiller???,Jodie Foster played a wonderful mother whose child disappears on a flight back to the states after her husband dies from an accident. The beginning is a little slow. Jodie Foster's character Kyle falls alseep and once awake she realizes her daugher is missing. She then begins to reek havoc on the flight. I thought the plot was a little simple and I thought it could have gone diffently. I saw the ending coming way before the middle. It was all in all an alirght movie. If you have a couple of hours to kill pop this baby in.
3,"Not enough to fill a feature, really","""Flightplan"" would've been good for one of those ""Creepshow""/""Twilight Zone"" anthology films if they still made them. As it stands, after about thirty minutes there's not much for Jodie Foster to do except find different ways to run around saying ""I'm not crazy, I know my daughter is on this plane!"" The performances and technical aspects of the film are decent -- they're what kept me from fast forwarding until the mystery is solved during the finale, which is easy to figure out if you've watched enough of these things."
3,A good suspense movie,"As always, Jodie Foster is excellent. Just like in the movie ""Panic Room"" (which this one inevitably gets compared to), you'll see her primal urge to protect her daughter. Like ""Panic Room"", it's a suspense flick, and has a tense feel throughout.Yes, there were holes in the plot. Yes, there was some weak dialogue. That's why it's 3 stars instead of 4. Why is it 3 instead of 2? Simple: Jodie Foster. She's what made this film work. Okay, she's often derided for having a ""deer in the headlights"" look, but it works for her - behind the look, you can see her thinking, you can see the wheels turning, you can see her fear and confusion. I also liked the sound and the lighting throughout the movie - it made me feel like I was there. The plane's interior was a wonderful piece of set work..In conclusion, I don't think I'd buy this new, but it's a definite thumbs-up for a rental or purchase/trade at a used DVD store."
2,"Rent, Don't Buy","Definitely recommend renting this one prior to purchasing. Pretty intriguing at the beginning but finally became incredulous, leaving this viewer wishing he had done something more productive with his time. The acting was good but, ultimately, the writing was not. As far as a purchase is concerned, the DVD is really worth only about $9.00...certainly not the current, almost $20 pricetag. Try Netflix first or get this used, at a reasonable cost."
2,Only one reason to watch this film...,"...and it's staring at you on the video cover. It's more proof of Jodie Foster's brilliance that she manages to make you care about this character, when absurdity abounds in every scene. No joke -- watch this with a 6-year old, and have him/her point out all the things in it that don't make sense. It's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy. Watch it anyway, because Foster is always worth it. But please, Hollywood, let's find this woman some projects that deserve her."
1,Crap... Absolute Crap...,"This movie is horrible, and should be avoided at all costs, the acting is disgusting (a fact made worse when you consider the cast) and the story is full of plot holes - the writers lean so heavily on the whole ""she must be crazy"" idea, they've left no room for any other explanation, and then try to give us one anyway, and what should have been a good twist will leave you scratching your head and thinking ""wow.. how dumb"".I cannot stress enough just how bad this film is... Buy something else!"
5,great great purchase!,"the price was great, the movie is awsome1 and what can i tell about judy foster that you dont already know!! higly recommended~!~"
3,Good entertainment.,Good movie. No award winner...just good entertainment. Foster is good as always...Could have cast a better bad guy. Director and Editor do an excellent job of pacing. Great late summer movie.
2,Mothers definitely won't like this one,"We have two young daughters, and my wife was definitely disturbed by this one. There's something primal about a story of a mother separated from her children that touches things that sometimes are best left undisturbed. In this case, the discomfort of the premise outweighed the entertainment value.Foster does a good job in the central role, but the plot is preposterous, the direction too slow, and the editing at the start is misleading, not in the sense of plot misdirection, but in the sense of setting up the tone for the rest of the movie.Not worth buying."
1,"""Ludicrous plot "" is much too kind / Throw Jodie from the plane","In too many thrillers, the plot depends upon an implausible, if not impossible, turn. This is the ultimate in such thrillers - the antagonist's plan depends upon an extended series of unpredictable, implausible/absurd and illogical occurrences. One element even depends upon the conjunction of three ridiculous circumstances.By halfway through this movie, you will be wondering why someone didn't kill Jodie Foster, and her character."
1,Dreadful,"Flightplan, or ""Flightpanned"" is implausible posturing and shrieking. Its total disregard for facts adds foolishness to tediousness. You know where the movie is going within 20 minutes and just like a real plane flight, you spend the rest of the time waiting for it to end.It is a wretched mess."
3,So-so action/suspense film,"Jodie Foster stars as the jittery, nervous heroine of this iffy action film... You're probably familiar with the plot: a grief-striken woman is taking her husband's coffin home on a trans-Atlantic superplane , and she freaks out when her six-year-old daughter disappears mid-flight. The set-up to the story is good -- when she goes to the captain and crew to try and get them to help, you know that somebody (maybe everybody?) is in on the plot, but you don't know who. Where the film fails is in the execution -- once we know who the bads guys are, the story goes completely flat and loses all originality. It lurches to a clumsy, perfunctory end... One big kaboom, and we're all done, with the plot, such as it is, wrapped up in a nice, tidy package. Even for a ""Hollywood film,"" this was kind of disappointing."
1,waste of time,"i watched this movie and enjoyed none of it. the script was bad and the acting was no better. if you enjoy being bored to tears from a movie, then by all means watch this one. if however you like a little more then a thin plot line and bad acting try a different movie."
3,Three-quarters of a good film; One-quarter...not,"There is quite a lot of FlightPlan to admire; Jodie Foster is terrific, the film itself is very stylish--opening shots very creepy--and the director and writer have you really wondering what's going on at a certain point. But then it all falls apart--you end up having wondered what's going on not because it's so fiendishly clever, but because it is so completely implausable. Personally, I don't consider that a sign of great film-making. And the Grand Finale--I'm sorry, but no mother who was also an aircraft engine designer would EVER do what Jodie Foster's character did, in an airplane still significantly loaded with jet fuel because they'd set down early on a trans-Atlantic flight. Lunacy. Disappointing lunacy. Still, we've seen worse. But if you've gotta see a creepy airplane movie, watch Red Eye instead."
1,The Best Thing About This Flick Was the Previews,"This could have been a good film. The previews certainly suggested as much.A woman, played by Jodie Foster, takes an airline flight with her young daughter, but the daughter just disappears and no one on the plane remembers her. It sounds promising, but the plot has about as many gaping holes as any film ever made. The makers of this flick were gambling that most viewers would be too stupid to notice them, and, based on the mostly positive reviews, it looks like their gamble paid off."
2,I should of missed this flight,"The best part of this movie unfortunately were the credits. I did enjoy Jodie Foster's role, however the movie as a whole did not deliver. It's obvious who the ""villians"" are in the very beginning. The way that they act so strange instead of trying to blend in more with the other people gave things away too soon.I did enjoy the design of the plane. It was neat to see a full lounge/bar and huge plasma TV screens in front of each seat. The technology was displayed in an up-to-date atmosphere that allowed the starbucks/cellphone/IPOD generation to feel right at home. All in all I wish that the movie had a much harder plot to figure out."
3,"""more fun to watch than it is to think about""...","... is an accurate rating from amazon.com. The movie doeswell to grip the attention and create suspense, and a lotof the the mother's psychological dilemna is interestingand the movie moves along briskly. However, some of the turnsand conversations make you scratch your head regarding thelogic/judgement involved. In the end, there are too many stretches, improbable contingencies, and logical complicationsregarding the ending. If you're interested in a fast paced emotional ride, this is a vehicle. However, the failure to tie the pieces in the end left me unsatisfied."
1,Terrible plot,"The first part of the movie where the protagonist is looking for her daughter is too drawn out. And when the truth is finally revealed, it's so far-fetched it's almost insulting. So many things could have gone wrong for the bad guys! How did they know she'd bring her husband's body, as well as her daughter with her? How could they know no passengers will notice her daughter? How could they possibly have predicted that she would unlock the casket (and why didn't they just get the lockpad code themselves)?"
3,subtitles needed,"This is a basic ""super girl"" flick, with the heroine smacking people around, blowing up a plane, and emerging triumphant. Ho hum. Foster is excellent; it's her kind of film. But at times viewers need subtitles. The actor playing the villain could hardly be understood at times, and Foster's harsh midwest accent is often submerged to an inaudible whisper.Overall, the film is a harmless way to spend an evening at home. If you're gripped by the plot and amazed by the action, you're probably under 15 and should be doing homework."
2,it was just aight,"huge Jodie Foster fan&I always expect her to bring a stand out performance,but this film is filled with so many cliches&Stereotypes on that Airplane that I just as soon just watch&be done with it. the story was interesting,but very predictable&it got tired real fast."
2,My zombie daughter is missing!!!,"As some of you have said before, I personally thought this was a paranormal thriller type movie,,,,but what a let-down to actually find out the real story behind it all. There are indeed many plot holes that seem way too big to just brush off (no one saw the daughter on the plane?..she was the first on board!! No one saw her daughter being kidnapped and injected with a drug or her luggage being taken?). The main character's daughter acted like a complete unfeeling zombie, I would have been glad to get rid of her."
3,Jodie Foster is very good.,"Many aspects of this movie work well. Jodie Foster raises this movie above the conventional thriller. The setting using a jumbo jet works. You get to see parts of the jet, for example, the cargo bay that a typical passenger never get to see. The pacing is good. The characters themselves are well written and believable. They make understandable decisions. One never has to ask why a character would do such a stupid thing.It is with the plot that I have the most trouble. It is fairly convoluted. It does answer the questions the veiwers have when they watch the movie. Why would anyone do this to Jody Foster's character? Why would they kidnap the daughter? Is the husband's death related in anyway? If there is a conspiracy, how big is it?However, there were quite a few holes in the plot that left me with a bad taste in my mouth after the movie. The movie just did't click for me at the end."
1,Jodie Foster CHOSE to do this?,"I understand that big stars pretty much pick and choose films to get involved with. I therefore assume that Ms Foster thought this was a good idea. It wasn't.It doesn't take long to figure out who is the real bad guy, and once that is out of the way there is little else going for the film. I could only tolerate hearing ""you're not listening to me"" in so many variations. Even Jodie Foster can keep that interesting for so long. The film hints at one of the attendants having sympathies for the distraught mom, and I kept waiting for the film to spring a surprise related to that. Nope. Then I thought they might be implying that the captain understood and might somehow help, Nope again.Bottom line: Very talented actor, but awful movie."
4,Claustophobic tension and Foster's strong performance make this film work.,After her husband's death Jodie Foster takes a plane trip with her daughter only to discover halfway through the flight that she's gone...or did she even exist?Terrific psychological tension ensues in a great setting that preys upon our most primal fears(losing a child)and our new fears(Post 9/11 flying anxiety).Foster's intense desparate performance is a nice contrast to the cold demeanors of the pilot and flight attendants.I love the fact that Flight Plan keeps you guessing about what's going on for most of the movie.Unfortunately when all is revealed it becomes more of a routine thriller and if you give it some thought there are plenty of logic gaps.Ordinary ending aside however Flight Plan is a well crafted suspense film and Foster proves once again she's one of the best actresses we have today.(Now only if she would make more movies!)
2,"Maybe She's Crazy, Maybe the Screenwriter's Are Too","This film had a good setup for the most part and the airplane set looks great but the story is thinner than King Kong's and the ending is dull and seems like a last minute idea when someone ran out of ideas. People were inferring Jodie Foster was doing another Panic Room, but this isn't even as good as that movie(which was only ok considering it was a David Finche film and I expected much more out of it). Foster seems to need a new manager who finds better scripts. Whatever happened to the actress who starred in Silence of the Lambs perhaps her taste in scripts got mediocre, because her films sure have."
4,very good thriller,Good acting and very entertaining. Keeps you guessing about Foster's mental state.
4,Highly Impressed - Beyond Expectations,"Flightplan delivers an edge-of-your-seat high-octane adrenaline rush. Jodie Foster is the star, however, it's the entire cast from top to bottom that makes Flightplan a takeoff hit! To the average viewer, you'd get the initial impression Flightplan attempts to rip-off the viewer with an unoriginal concept (mother losing her daughter on a plane post 9/11), but when you look between the lines, you notice the depth of the plot this movie molds itself into (the psyche of Kyle Pratt and bizarre twist of events). Sure, Flightplan is no masterpiece, but this movie delivered well beyond my expectations. I'm confident this underrated film will do the same for you."
3,oh well,"Like another reviewer stated, Jodie Foster can do no wrong, and for that alone I can recommend ""Flightplan""... BUT...I was disappointed with the ""Hollywood"" way the plot resolved. It really could have ended in more interesting ways, but oh well. The first half of the movie was a real cool ride of suspense where you didn't know who was the bad guy, or even if there was a bad guy. Wish they could've decided on a more clever plot twist to make the ending as satisfying. However Jodie Foster proves once again she is one of the greatest American actors working today."
3,Entertaining but far fetched,"Flightplan is a fun summer movie, and is lacking a bit in logical department for a Fall movie. Foster is as good as she can be, but she cant safe the poor plot line. I was expecting more than the movie gave me."
1,Same old Same old,"More of the same as far as thrillers go. Pretty much figured it out quite early on. I was looking for something a bit more deep. After ""The Game"" and ""Unbreakable"" it's pretty hard for thrillers to compare. Save the silly trite endings for cable TV. Jodi Foster must have done this one to get a better role in something else. If this film blows you away then you have not seen much. Other than her decent performance the film was lame."
5,An amazing mystery/ thriller. It's so interesting!,"Flightplan is unlike any movie i've seen before! How the flight attendants and airplane crew, deny ever seeing Kyle Pratt's(Jodie Foster)daughter, is interesting. This movie caught my attention,I would find myself trying to remember if I saw her daughter on the plane!It's a unique movie. I know this review doesn't say much about Flightplan, but this is how I felt about it. WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T!!!"
5,EXCELLENT - MYSTERY - TENSION,I do not pull a movie apart.I enjoy some of Jodi Foster's movies - I was also looking to see what part was given to Sean Bean [Sharp's series].I personally enjoyed the mystery - was also wondering if the daughter was a figment of her imagination. Great acting.The reason for the whole plot? Well I never did pick up on that until it was explained.I also suspected the maligned Arab man. Her sanity. But I did get lost in the layout of the plane.The story is thoroughly enjoyable for a thriller - well worth watching.
4,"Solid film, kept me entertained.","Flightplan starrring Jodie Foster is a well-rounded airplane thriller flick. I saw this in the movie theatre and I didn't lose interest. The only thing that annoyed me about Flightplan is how Foster's character, Kyle thinks two Arab passengers killed her husband the week before, very cliche and embarrassing moment, should have been left on the cutting room floor. Otherwise than that, this film is an intelligent, psychological thrill ride. Of course Foster is exceptional in every film she is in, good or bad. I would defintely rent this movie, very surprising."
5,Great service,"Great movie and great service. Everything was fine. This is the best review I can give! Why am I ""forced"" to use 20 characters?Thanks,Dorothy Steiner"
2,My Lips Are Sealed,"My great-grandmother used to say, ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.""The premise was a good one with which to start. The jet looked cool, like something on which I'd like to take a flight. I think some of the actors really tried.That's all I have to say."
2,Not worth it.,I'm just not impressed with this product. The product leaves a dry white residue and my skin feels dry and tight. So not worth the 100 dollars.
5,Do not ask me to write a review and then TELL me the minimum amount of words to use! A simple satisfied would suffice!,Do not ask me to write a review and then TELL me the minimum amount of words to use! A simple satisfied would suffice!
4,Review,The item I purchase played fine. All is well with the product. The time it took to receive the item was very long.
1,Disappointing,"I was dissapointed, but not due to the story line. I was expecting something else and got a short comic book version of a tale about an orc who comes to appreciate art."
1,Wrong item,This is the wrong battery and charger. My Kodak east share is Z1085 is and I can't even use these products.
5,A splendid reflection on poetry,"Alice Fulton here offers beautifully crafted essays on poets and poetry, emphasizing the power of estrangement that gives lyric much of its interest. Emily Dickinson plays an important role in this book, but above all the reader will find elegant and telling formulations about poetry's exploration of possibilities of feeling."
5,Great product Fast service,I was very pleased with the calendar I ordered from the seller. It was shipped very quickly and was in perfect condition.I would definitely buy other products from this seller.
5,The Single Parent Resource,"The Single Parent Resource is one of the most practical and comprehensive guides available today. With an easy to navigate table of contents, the book lends itself as a ready reference guide. As a single parent, I was impressed with the amount of information packed into it. It covers many of the issues that I have encountered and provides solutions that work. Single parenting is not easy but Brook Noel's book gives me more tools to deal with real life, day to day challenges. Thank you for giving me this help."
2,Not what I hoped for,A bit out of touch. I was hoping for more ideas and tactics to attack my new challenges as a single parent. It felt more like a warning of what was to come. Not very helpful or uplifting.
4,Grommets?,"Might sound silly to review grommets but there are grommets and then there are grommets...... One thing is for sure, the grommets arrived on time for my motorcycle repair, worked fine although I definitely recommend something to make them slip on easier. You can also soak in hot water for ease of installation. There, its a review! Price was right, shipping free, cheaper than local purchase and less effort."
3,Pretty Good,It is good for if you are on an elliptical and want some upbeat motivation for music. Not good if you are teaching a step class.
2,Not inspiring,I didnt get much inspiration from this cd - its dull. Far better to check out dynamix.com for work out cds.
3,"Sums up the hits, dance artists, and remixers of the era...","Definitely a ""greatest hits"" collection of dance mixes from the day, this one is filled with club hits and cheesy commercial radio hits. The real tragedy here is that, several of these songs, which are near impossible to find on CD, are all very short on this disc. Track times:1. professional widow (3:58)2. america (I love America) (5:10)3. For the love of you (tony moran mix) (4:58)4. The bomb (4:35)5. Heartbeat (e-smoove mix) (5:57)6. Close to you (4:20)7. The boss (5:57)8. once in a lifetime (3:41)9. Make my body rock (4:55)10. never get enough (junior's deep factory mix) (4:42)11. tonight is the night (with the ORIGINAL vocalist, not the re-recording) (5:20)12. everybody be somebody (back in the days mix) (6:35)"
2,Eye Candy? Yes. Ear Candy? Maybe.,"I saw this CD and it drew my eye just as they'd planned. There's a shirtless, good-looking man on the cover. It said OUT on it, so I figured it was to benefit the magazine and I figured that they'd have a pretty good mix. However as is usual with DJ mix CDs there are a few songs you're sure to have heard and then in the midst of it are the songs that you've probably never heard of and that some producer was desperate to get on the CD for exposure.It's marketed as a ""Workout"" CD, and the liner notes do contain some information on exercises but you could get the same information in any issue of ""Men's Health"" magazine for much less, and the men are just as pretty. And to be honest I have Nine Inch Nails albums with a better and more consistent beat. In my opinion, it's a total marketing ploy aimed at gay men. Some songs are good, but the mixing is bad which tends to make the songs too short. This has gone to my CD shelf and is collecting dust."
3,"Good, non-traditional Western.","To me a Western novel is Louis L'Amour--end of story. This may not be fair to other authors, but so be it. This book is NOT Louis L'Amour-ish. Not enought action, and at times the protagonist didn't stand up for himself. But--I liked this book quite a bit once I got into it. Lots of interesting characters who are well drawn. The plot was tight and credible. And there is some L'Amour stuff--main guy a real hero tough guy. The right girl marrying the wrong guy. Maybe the best compliment I can pay to this book is that I am going to suggest my 14-year-old son read it. Definately worth reading."
3,"Works OK, thus far. Will update review with time. Stay tuned.","This filter seems to be of the same quality as other filters of the same kind that I have used before. Based on what previous filters of this sort have done for the air in my home, I would expect it to last for about a year before needing to be replaced. The air coming out seems to smell fresher. I am not sure how much of this is attributable to the outer charcoal filter, however. If I have more substantive comments, I will be certain to update this review with them. The cost remains fairly stable, thankfully."
1,Not the real thing,"Recently, the real Guess Who--meaning Burton Cummings, Randy Bachman, and other original members--reunited. So why would you want this soulless, lifeless attempt by former member Jim Kale to tread on the true classic band's name? In addition, Kale isn't even on the thing! Wait for the video and live album from the 2000 reformation to be released, buy Live at the Paramount or American Woman, but forget this dreck. One further footnote: Carl Dixon is the worst replacement for a replacement for a replacement for a replacement for a replacement for a replacement singer in the history of rock. Get it?"
2,Ever stop to look at an accident on the freeway?,"That's the morbid curiosity that brought me to purchase this CD. I guess I just wanted to hear this band try to put these songs over as their own. Frightening. I mean, really, it's not that it's BAD, but how can ANYONE but Burton Cummings sing these songs as ""The Guess Who?""One play and filed along with the multitudes of [junk] that I keep for amusement.Definitely stay away from this one if you really want ""The Guess Who"" but definitely grab it if you want to watch them pull the bodies out of the flaming car from the other side of the road."
1,should be NO stars,"The Guess Who IS Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman. This particular CD is homemade, released on a homemade label. Don't believe any review that says this is worth anything at all--any of Jim Kale's bands had no artistic credibility at all. Ask yourself this: This particular recording has five musicians, NONE OF WHICH had anything to do with the original recordings by the orginal Guess Who--except the drummer, who didn't write or sing. So why would you want to bother. As for this being the band's ""best lineup,"" this isn't the Guess Who. Get this CD outta print--it's worthless. Don't be a sucker!!"
4,Easier to Install Film,Product is essentially peel and stick although I still use the water to help slide it around. Works well and is much easier than the glue on type which can be very frustrating.
2,maybe 2.5 on a good day,"i have their great early.alt.country album _gas food lodging_ and love it. so why not pick up the greatest hits for a couple bucks? but i've already sold it back. some of it was ok, but after that aforementioned album, they mellowed out, which is unfortunate as they were already a bit too mellow to begin with. some good tracks lost amongst throwaways."
4,Very brief though very good,"As a psychologist specializing in treating fear, I found this book very interesting. It is written in everyday language so avoids accademic jargon etc. Each of the 100 fears covered has 2 pages explaining the fear and then offers strategies to deal with it. If you want a whole lot of advice on one specific fear e.g. fear of heights, then you may be disappointed. However the 2 pages of advice it gives on each fear is thorough and impressive. Previously I would have thought it impossible to condense down treatment strategies for a particular fear in 2 pages but this author has done it pretty well. Good light read on different types of fears and well worth a look.Anthony Gunn, psychologist and author ofFear Is Power: Turn Your Fears Into Success"
2,Too big,"I first ordered these as Large since I wear women's size 9 shoes. They were huge! So I returned them, having to pay Amazon the shipping charges even though there was no size explanation given in teh original description. I ordered another pair, Medium, which are also so large that I have to shuffle to keep them on my feet."
4,comfortable & absorbent,These are perfect for walking to and from our outdoor hot tub in the cold of winter. Warm and comfortable and very water absorbent.Size was as expected for my size 7.5 feet.
3,Mild,"I appreciate Will's music. Been a fan since the mid 90's. This film was ok. I prefer to not shatter the illusions which some artists provide. This film won't do that. I've watched it once and likely will not watch it again. Honestly, my own experiences would be more exciting to watch but I'm not Will Oldham."
3,Senior Driver's Guidebook: How To Keep Driving Longer . . .,"I read the Senior Driver's Guidebook with interest, as one who deals with rush-hour traffic on a daily basis. I appreciated receiving the benefit of the author's years of experience as both a driver's license examiner & working with the Dept. of Transportation. I learned many tips and ideas to make driving easier and safer as our state's freeways become less safe. The author emphasizes defensive driving throughout the book, and then tells us how we can accomplish that in various situations that arise. I liked the format, because I could read a chapter or two and put it down until I had more time to digest more information. I also liked the little tests at the end of each chapter. I would recommend this book for anyone who drives today's crazy roads and freeways."
1,The Senior Driver's Guidebook,"According to his biography, the author is an expert on traffic accident records. He is not qualified to write a driving or drivers manual for senior drivers simply because he has become a senior driver. Of the 108 pages, 35 are devoted to the title's subject. The rest of the pages are filler. The writing is unclear and inane. ""Being inattentive to the possibilities of a collision with a train is a sad way to end a nice quiet ride in the country."" Do tell. The structure of the book leads the reader into mazes and blind alleys. The best part of the book is the bibliography and the five pages of State vehicle department addresses. My $25 could have been much better spent."
3,this was an ok book!,"This book is about collected stories, talking about enbarrassing moments. The storys are manly comeing from teenagers. And they are from all over the world!In a way i liked the book, but in a way i didnt.I liked it because it was funny,and i thought these people must not have been to enbarrassed if they would share there stories with the world. But i didnt like it because...i dont like reading. And this is just a book i would never read again!I injoyed the hole book.i liked the first story.The one where the girl lost her top in the swimming pool, and the life gard held her up in front of everyone.Yes i would recomend this book to people. Because i hate reading but for the most part i liked this book. It is one of the few i like (i like 'The Outsiders' to)But yes i recomend this book."
4,It's good,"My child, who is 8, wanted to try her hand at reviewing this super collection of mortifying anecdotes:I liked it because it shows embarrassing things do happenso I really liked it. I don't have a favorite.I suggest you buy thisbook if you are frightened of embarrising moments."
3,Not as expected,"The video was what I was looking for and it worked great, but it was missing the box...it was just a naked tape and I wasn't aware of that. C'est la vie"
4,This is the best of the crop,Many celebrities asked Andrée Putman to create a new interior for them. Mainly in New-York and in Paris. This book gathers a lot of reviews you might have read in a slightly different form in magazines such as Architectural Digest or Interiors. Nothing original. it's just a comprehensive look at Putman's global work.
3,Good reference book,"The book was divided into various chapters. The introduction was allocated to describe Andree's childhood, how her inspiration came by, how she channelled her relentless energy into creating masterpieces subsequently. Then, the book gets into business right-a-way with illustrations (with descriptions) of hotels, showrooms, offices, museums, restaurants, shops, galleries, apartments, cinema, editions & licenses (for products). The final 3 chapters were collaborators, credits, index. For Andree's enthusiasts, I'm sure this book would appeal but for those readers who want to be behind the scene, trying to understand in-depth of the thinking & designing process, then, this book is no more than a eye candy book which might disappoint."
1,celine dion live in paris,"could not watch becaues of the region im in, in here in the states so I had to return it. so disappointed thought."
3,Some real good songs,"I bought this album because it had 3 songs on it that I really liked a lot, and they are ""Fly like an Eagle"" by Seal, ""I believe I can fly"" by R.Kelly, and ""For you I will"" by Monica. I am not a fan of rap, so there are some on here that I am not keen on, like ""All of my days"" and ""Hit 'em high"", but for the most part this album is cool. It certainly is not over-powered by the rap. In fact the Bugs Bunny song is quite good. And the D'Angelo song ""I found my smile again"" is good r&b."
5,"No this is not a SONGtrack, its the score and its excellent","So if you're looking ""I Believe I Can Fly"" or another song from the film, this is not the CD you're looking for. But if you're a fan of James Newton-Howard or like pure fun cartoon music, this is a great CD to get."
2,I Like It,"This is not the purchase you should make if you are buying for a child who likes the movie Space Jam. The child will not recognize most of the songs and the language is not appropriate for younger children in several songs. If you are older looking for some good music, buy it. For younger Space Jam fans, buy the soundtrack."
4,Sweet Nostalgia,"This classic was shipped very quickly - the only hiccup was a crack in the back of the CD case. Could have been during shipping, not sure. Fortunately, the CD itself is what I was anticipating, not the case. Overall, I'm excited to tap back into my classic MJ days."
4,An amazing CD!,"I really enjoyed this CD. It has a good variety of rap and pop music. I love how the songs are of all differant varieties, so if you don't like rap, you still might like the CD. Good Job!"
2,The only good song was Hit'Em High,"Track number 5 was spectacular. One of the best rap songs I've ever heard. It was an amazing song by Method Man, B-Real, Coolio, LL, Busta. Method Man and LL had the best lyrics and beats were very well done. The song was full of energy and you can bang your head to it as well. All the other rap songs on this CD is a joke, they are some of WORST I've ever heard. I am a big rap fan but other than Hit Em High those other guys just plain WACK. I DO NOT recommend you to get this CD if you like hardcore rap, like me. Just download the MP3 Hit ""Em High. Fly Like An Eagle was good an also is I Believe I can Fly."
2,WARNING: This CD is not what you think you're getting.,This CD does not have the dance music that you think that you're getting. This is just the little blurps of music scattered throughout the movie.
4,ANYone can enjoy this one,"This is one heck of a soundtrack! Hip hop and pop rock are the primary genres for Space Jam. You have R. Kelly, Seal, Monica, and D'Angelo singing extraordinary songs that anyone can enjoy listening to. My personal favorite song is ""Hit 'Em High"" by B Real, Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J, and Method Man. It's pretty family-friendly, but it's still got an amazing beat and some creative lyrics. Monica's ""For You I Will"" is a classic, while R. Kelly's ""I Believe I Can Fly"" is an excellent cover. ""Space Jam"" by Quad City DJ's is also very catchy, and ""Basketball Jones"" by Barry White and Chris Rock is pretty funny. The last track called ""Buggin'"" is . . . weird. It's strange to hear Bugs rap; actually, it's strange to hear the Looney Tunes rap at all. But the rest of the soundtrack is solid. Even if you don't like hip hop, you'll probably like it here."
4,Space Jam: Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture,"Bugs Bunny provides a straightforward rap track, ""Buggin',"" with the help of Elmer Fudd, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. The soundtrack, like the film, is full of energy and silliness, but there are moments of genuine sweetness: All-4-One's earnest and soulful ""I Turn To You"" and R. Kelly's gospel-inspired ""I Can Fly."""
2,The Concise Townscape,Too concise. Had to get copies of pictures left out from previous copy.Dorothy Ramsay
4,One of the best films ever made.,"I think that this is one of director Joe Dante's best films ever made. The film's subject provides an interesting an entertaining look at what could happen in the United States in the future. The issues discussed in the film such as racism, immigration, and the United States as the only remaining powerful nation on Earth made this film both serious and humorous. The film also had a great cast. They gave convincing and effective performances. I think that this is a really great movie. It's really worth watching."
4,"Amazing, provocative movie","What is really surprising is that this HBO video ever made it to DVD! Its about a repressive president who steps over a line, and the Western governor takes him on-sort of. Its played for laughs, but events spin out of control. When you start calling out the troops to defend your country, sometimes things just happen-and your country really does get defended. Vaguely similar to the Turner Diaries, in that its about the conflict between the Eastern repressive Federalists and the Western (think Montana) free staters. Watch it-no matter what part of the political spectrum you are on. The one thing I've found that liberals and conservatives all agree on is that government does many things badly. And the governments in this movie do things badly!"
3,Second Civil war,This was a gift the person enjoys the movie and it came fast the person who received it would recommend it
4,Things to come,This picture was written quite a few years ago. Now it seems like its coming to life. I have to wonder if its really fiction.
4,Funny yet disturbingly realistic look at our future.,"A funny, yet all to realistic look at America's immigration policy debacle. With the country over run by millions of recent immigrants, many of which whom can't speak english, the nation heads for an uncertain future. Leading the counter charge against mass immigration is a state governor whose attention is not on the nations problem, but instead on his estranged hispanic reporter mistress."
2,My wife and I fell asleep,"I know. I know. This is a spoof. It isn't supposed to take itself seriously. But even as spoof, the characters in this effort did not develop enough depth to elicit any kind of emotion or concern in me. So this is funny? There's enough xenophobia, sleaze and megalomania in real life politics anyway. If you can stay awake, you might find something to chuckle about here and there. But this was no kneeslapping rollick. And you won't find many allusions to the first Civil War here, either, if you are expecting them. Then maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. My wife and I fell asleep."
5,This is a very amazing album,"I bought this cd about a year ago because i heard the song; ""Return of tthe Mack"" a lot on the radio. I loved it. When I popped it in my cd player, I was amazed to hear the first track(Crazy remix) nearly better than Return of the Mack. I knew that there would be more awesome songs on the way. And I was right, there were. Crazy, Let's Get Down, Trippin', and Horny were all excellent songs. But Return of the Mack is the best song. I recommend that you get this!"
4,this was a cool cut,I use to Bump this Jam back in 97.i wanted the Original&the re-mixes.didn't expect alot of His Album but this Jam got much play on my stereo system&the jam still gets pumped up in the House.
1,This CD should never have been created,"Why name a CD ""Return of the Mack"" and then not actually have the title hit on the CD? I purchased the CD, and even though track 5 is listed (on the package and the Amazon list) as the actual recording of his hit, it isn't anywhere on the entire CD. I returned it, and I'll purchase the download of the song I really wanted, ""RETURN OF THE MACK""."
2,NOT GOOD,Its so sad this man has an amazing voice but the best song one the cd is return of the mack. They could have done betta with the music arrangements to bring his voice out . I know its english music but still could have given him betta songs
4,return of the mack album,"Hey, I only wanted the return of the mack song, but figured i might like some of the other selections. I really don't like any other songs but i love return... enough to make it worth buying the whole album. Most importantly, it wasn't available to buy on itunes."
5,Return of the Mack...,"Personally, as ""old"" as this music is, I thoroughly enjoy it. I got it at a great price and ""jam"" it at my desk at work!! Five stars..."
5,All my life I have been misusing the numbers,"In a way, I feel very frustrated with this wonderful book, it remainded me when my father recommended me the 7 Habits of Covey and told me "" Its sad I found this at 60 and not a your age""... well, its sad to be 42, a mechanical engineer and someone who studies math as a hobby to suddenly realize that I have been using numbers without a guide to their context..All I can say that this should be required education material at all levels of schooling.."
4,The best camera for everyday and trips,"No, this camera doesn't have the most pixels or the biggest zoom. However, you will use it the most for two reasons. It is small enough to take in a shirt pocket or purse. The main feature is ""audio notation"" which records 15 seconds of audio after each picture. When, you return from a trip, you don't have to try to remember what city or landmark you visited. In a few mouse clicks, you can create a slide show with your own voice describing the sites. Very few cameras have this feature, and some who have it don't know how to use it, but it is a great general purpose camera. Most people who see it in use ask what it is and how to get it."
2,Poorly Implimented,"Cute size, but totally inconvienient. Anemic battery life. Poor button placement, difficult to aim when using viewfinder. 16M card does not fit into standard adaptors and doesn't hold many pictures. Menus are tedious for frequent functions.Got it as a gift and would not purchase again."
1,Minolta Dimage Xi digital camera,"I took some pictures with this camera and tried to transfer them to my computer by carefully following the steps in the manual. The photos would not transfer. I called the Minolta support line and tried for six hours to get this thing to work. The computer was looking for a driver that did not exist on the Windows 2000 software. Minolta support sent me to the Microsoft site to look for the driver. Then back again to get the latest service pack. However none of these things worked and I had to return the camera...I cannot understand...why Minolta does not include the required drivers on the installation C/D.So be warned, if you are running Windows 2000 it may be prudent to purchase your digital camera from another manufacturer."
2,sacrificing image quality for size,"I love everything about this camera EXCEPT the quality of the images.Very easy to use. Quick on/off. Images captured quickly (except for highest resolution, which takes forever). Very compact.HOWEVER, the image quality is POOR under most conditions, especially low light.I have a 3 megapixel olympus digital camera which is not-compact and BLOWS this one away for image quality."
3,OK but,"This is a very interesting camera, lots of features, easy to use and to load pictures and or movies into computer. But I suspect it's very vulnerable to sand damage. I carried mine in my pocket. After a couple of weeks a grinding noise on turn on/off. Sand had gotten into the camera. Warrenty voided. I would carry it in a ziplock bag from now on."
2,"Nice camera, but keep it away from sand and dirt","As another reviewer already noted, this camera is easily damaged by sand. Its much touted ""internal folded zoom lens"" has a number of small plastic gears that are exposed internally in its aluminum case. The case is not well sealed, so sand can get in there easily. And a few grains is all that takes to hose it. I took mine on my last vacation, and although I never actually took it to beach, a few sand specks in my pocket made their way into the camera. Took it apart and used compressed air to try to clean it, but no luck. What is the point of a miniature camera that must be stored in a hermetic case or bag?"
5,Improved version of an already great digicam,"I have the original Dimage X (the 2MP version) and now wish I had waited! The Xi has 50% more pixels and also more optical zoom. Any potential buyer should be aware that the 3X refers to optical zoom, i.e., real stuff, not digitized zoom. I find the new model even easier to hold and operate, so I don't understand why some people complain. The size and styling and the optical zoom are the main selling points, but the camera also has decent image quality and fast recycle times. If you are a casual photographer, you won't be disappointed."
5,the best camera ever,this is the best camera ever! I have been satisfied with it since the first time I used it. The picture quality is amazing and the 3.2 mp provide for good quality when you transfer them to the computer. It has a very sleek design as well which makes its easy to carry around without it being noticable. I am happy with my product! You should invest in one.
3,"Decent, basic home tape backup device","As hard drives get larger, so do storage devices to backup those enormous hard drives. Problem here is that via the parallel port, it can take an extremely long time to backup that 20 GB hard drive. I got the external thinking I could use it on multiple systems through the parallel port; truth is I have never used it on more than my main system. My recommendation is if you are going to spend a few hundred dollars on a tape backup system and only use it on one system, opt to get the SCSI version of this tape drive, or buy a SCSI DAT tape drive. Another complaint that I have is that the drive does NOT come with a tape. The media is also proprietary, so you may have a tough time finding it on retail shelves, and in a couple of years you won't be able to find it at all."
1,Is OnStream still in Business????,I had an OnStream DI-30 ... Dead now at 6 months old ... no place to get a replacement!!!!
5,A teenage adventure book with a touch of romance,"This adventure book has you on the edge of you seat as Amanda, a gutsy city girl, encounters killer storms, deadly gators and snakes, outlaws, and runaway buffalo. You'll also find yourself cheering Amanda on as she races against the aggravating but handsome David. This book transports you to the Wild West where you'll meet lovable characters you'll never forget"
5,The Best Book Ever !,"This book has everthing a person could want in a book. It has adventure, romance, comedy, and suspence. Its about Amanda a girl going to Texas with her mom to save buffalo. While in Texas she meets David and the story gets better and better from thier."
2,the worst of the taltos series,"While this one is important for character development (both Vlad and Cawti's), it was also a pain in the arse to read. Apparently Brust himself was having marital difficulties around the time he wrote this, which he sub-consiously put into the book. The 2 strengths of these books are(at least to me) the well-rounded, likeable character of Vlad and the way the books is like a fantasy version of the Mafia. In this one the Mafia idea is not really used, and the characterization is more like something you need to know for later books than actually enjoyable to read. I read this series years ago, and this is the one that stands out least in my mind - even a friend i lent it to cried out in pain when talking about it. I only gave it an extra star for Brust, I have all his stuff and think he's (usually) a great writer. So in conclusion, I warn you, stay away from this dreck for your very sanity!"
2,Exqueeze me?,"In this book, several major characters seem to have been replaced by alien pod-replicants and forgotten everything that made them likeable and distinct in previous parts of the series, and quite a few minor characters never get a chance to be likeable OR distinct. I'm as in favor of peasant uprisings as the next prole, but the less Brust has going on in the socio-political background the better his books seem to be."
2,Boring,"I really like the whole Vlad Taltos series by Brust - but this one was horrible, there's no other way to say it. It was all about the revolution of Easterners and the Teckla in South Adrilankha, it read like some revolutionary pamphlet. Vlad and Cawti were fighting the whole time and she behaved in such an uppity way, she looked at him like he was some kind of filth on her shoes, that I couldn't understand what he saw in her, why he still loved her and kept running after her like a lost puppy. And even Vlad's usual ""victory"" smacked of defeat this time, he didn't really get his revenge. So yeah, too philosophical, too revolutionary, too boring."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Vlad's marriage is becoming strained, and Cawti has fallen in with a revolutionary group, who, basically, want a better deal for the working classes. This leaves her husband in political opposition to his wife, and struggling with what to do.Cawti has put herself in danger from both the Jhereg and others because of her new connections, and Vlad has to decide what to do, which side he is on, and who to act against. A very different tone than the first two books, perhaps dealing with Brust's own personal state."
1,Read the fine print before you buy...,"As a grad student preparing for his comprehensive exams, I searched long for an exemplary introduction to game theory. The descriptions of this book which I found on the web led me to believe Osborne's book was the one I needed. The book starts off promising enough. The preface exclaims that ""the only way to appreciate the theory....is to put it into action"" and that over 280 exercises will allow you to do this.Then comes the part they don't tell you - those 280+ exercises have no solutions. They are not included in the text. Even after contacting the author he refused access to the solutions.So what may have just been the best intro to game theory ever done is useless to a self-motivated learner. The only purpose I can see that it serves is as a required text book for a course.Bottom line - unless you HAVE to have this for a class, don't waste your money. It will be very wisely spent elsewhere."
3,Check the website,"If you really want to know if this is the book for you, just go to the author's website (a Google search of Osborne game theory ought to bring it up). The text and solutions to many of the problems are available there."
1,"Unnecessarily complicated, scarily mathematical","Was unfortunate to get that as a compulsory text book for a graduate course. Nearly lost my mind reading it had to supplement this book with a few others.I do admit that game theory has a lot to do with mathematics but this book unnecessarily in my opinion uses a sea of useless symbols, expressions and definitions using hardcore mathematics which were really hard to follow, and can easily be expressed using intuitive language. Granted i am not the most mathematically minded individual and may be this is the reason. The bizarre structure of the book and lack of answers to the problems and exercises did not make it any easier.I kept the book after passing the subject (thank god), hoping that it will grow on me, nothing yet. The bottom line if you are mathematically challenged like myself steer clear of this abomination, the travesty of a text book."
2,two stars,"one star for publicly available solutions to some of the problems. a helpful resource.one star for being pretty standard and precise.dry beyond belief. oddly organized. precise, but not exactly clear."
3,A modern view of game theory,"The book offers several argument about modern applications of the game theory. Particullary, it is importantant the Bayesan probability and the relation with the information theory. The autor leads the student into the secrets of the actual economy. I'm sorry that the cooperative games are treated no completly."
2,"Pay attention, if you want to read","If you want to know the basic history of public deficits in these countries, I recommend this book. This book is a good introduction to a comparative study of political trial to lessen public deficits. But in spite of its subtitle, you can't get information of ' Economic and Political Consequences' of public deficits from this book. This book consists of 6 chapters. Each chapter (except 1st chapter and last chapter) deals a country survey. Each chapter consists of 5 sections ('The history of the deficit problem', 'The institutional framework for decisions on the deficit', 'The debt crisis in perspective', 'Deficit control policies' and 'Deficits the (country's name) experience')."
3,peep show,move is loops from previous footage of different porn in the 70's.it is very explicit however the film quality is not sharp at some pointsthe women are good looking with nice bush which is quite rare today.john holmes is quite unique.
2,"Love Melissa & Doug products, but not the rattles!","I had my doubts about ANY rattle that was made of wood, let alone a painted one. We have this and the fish rattle by Melissa & Doug; both have cracked and peeled with even the most minimal exposure to moisture (drooling and teething tend to be pretty wet experiences). Also, all toys, especially those which go straight into the mouth (which is most of them) have to be washed a LOT. Another issue is that this is really going to hurt when babies smack themselves in the head with it, and they probably will, depending upon the age of the child.Both rattles look terrible, with chipped, fading paint. They were cute (at first) and appealing, on the plus side. I would not recommend these, or give them as gifts, to anyone with an infant. They seem to be more decorative than functional. We have always had Melissa & Doug products and really enjoy them, but will probably steer clear of their baby items."
3,funky monkey,"i was initially disappointed in this rattle as it doesn't really ""rattle"". it was not of much interest/use when my son was little. as he got older and could grasp, he liked to bang it. all this banging has scuffed the monkey and some of the paint has started to chip off (and onto the floor/wall). it has now found itself on the shelf and will be pulled out again when he doesn't put everything in his mouth. i am afraid of him getting a splinter in his mouth."
4,Bike Rack,"This is a very good product. It swings out of the way - even when loaded with bikes - allowing me access to the bed area of my Tahoe. It folds down nicely, allowing me to park in my garage without removing the rack from the truck. On the downside, it is pretty expensive and it is fairly difficult to get the rack mounted on the truck. However, I am not aware of a better bike rack (at any price) intended for use with an SUV with swing-out (i.e. not swing-down) tail gates."
5,Great family bike rack,"Just wanted to add to the other reviews that this rack can carry our 4 family bikes: my husband's mountain bike, my petite women's bike, my kids' 20"" and 16"" bikes. Pretty easy to lash them on and take off in a jiffy!"
3,Tecumseh L-Head Engines,"This book was okay, but it did not have my engine type in it, among all the tecumseh engines listed. I did find similar information that represent my engine."
1,pure mess.,"i had this a long time ago and it sucks, the movies are good its just the audio blanks out the cuss words like it was filmed on Tv and it gets really annoying, i don't understand why they would do that because they still have the ratings for each movie, so stay away from this crap."
5,"The most heart pumping, blood rushing cd of 98","junior, jd,and i do a bit of downhill mountainbiking....no cd in our collections gets us more juiced and ready to hit "" mach 10"" screaming down mt. snow than ""911"" 96 rules!"
5,supa fly hardcore rock'n album!,"This album just makes me trip out! It's so intense,it makes me break into a new level of consciousness,it get's me so f*ck'n psyched to train my ass off on my mountain bike!"
3,I'm not convinced,"Roger Maris was a very good ballplayer. I like author Allen, but this seems to be nothing more than a pitch to place Maris in Cooperstown. As I said, Maris was a very good ballplayer, but not worthy of the Hall of Fame."
2,Not Impressed,"I had purchased this a a craft/photography viewing light, as it's advertised as full spectrum lamp. Not really suitable for my purposes, as it still has a yellow tint to the light. Maybe it would be alright in the living room to read by. I later found the Clear-Lite 23 watt CFL, which I much prefer for viewing photos.Clear-Lite 106549 ECO 23-Watt (100-Watt Equivalent) Natural Full Spectrum CFL Bulb, 1 Pack, White"
2,Not as good as the hype says it is,"Not as good as Joy Of Sex was/is. If you have gone this long without having sex you may want to just go ahead and take up knitting or golf or both. Sorry but there's a lot to be said for ""use it or lose it""."
2,CD-ROM FOR WINDOWS,I NEED TO KNOW IF THIS PRODUCT WILL WELL WORK WITH MAC COMPUTERS WITHOUT BUYING ANY SOFTWARE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A PC COMPUTER
5,MOST BAD ASS MOVIE EVER!!!,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! seriously like kick ass... non stop action... great story line... and is pretty freakin funny as well... i can't imagine anyone not liking it... definitely more better than good
4,Pleasant diversion,"After all the CG c...p, it's good to have one of these 2 hour diversions with proven actors/actresses comfortably going thru their paces with no effort. Willis and Freeman are reunited after being in a similar type of film (Lucky Slevin, which is also good), although Freeman don't get to do much in this film. Malkovich, whom I enjoy immensely hams it up along with Mirren. Not much to the story - just relax and watch the pros do their thing."
4,a good old time,"Sometimes you watch a movie and sense that the actors had as much fun as the audience. This is one of those. Won't change the world, but it is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. You'll have a good time."
4,An unexpected delight,"An unexpected delight. The ""miscasting"" is intriguing and works well. Helen Mirren with a tommy gun - somehow it works."
4,R.E.D,"Cool, fun and differeny movie (may contain: spoiler alerts)About retired FBI agent that have trubble accepting the slow and dull life.I think this movie is fun and get aditional cool because I think this is a frech and new plot that hasn`t been done like this befor.R.E.D- Retired extremly dangerous: I recomend it for everyone who like a good action comedy movie"
3,"The movie is pure star-driven fun, but really? Lossy audio on Blu-ray?","Red (Movie-Only Edition) [Blu-ray]First: this movie is just plain fun, an action confection which coasts comfortably on the charisma of its familiar stars. I contend that anyone who judges it really harshly is being way too serious.And I was perfectly happy to buy a reduced-price movie-only Blu-ray release. The DVD extras are only rarely something I'm actually interested in. I just wanted a good-quality transfer of the feature at a reasonable price.That's where things went wrong. The video transfer was... perfectly okay. But I didn't believe my eyes (and ears, once the movie started): this Blu-ray includes only nasty, muffled old low-bitrate lossy Dolby Digital audio tracks. You know, the kind you thought were a thing of the past once you switched to a format with the bandwidth of Blu-ray.That's just completely cheesy and unacceptable. This film would've been far more engaging if the sound transfer had been up to snuff."
5,just see it,"Just see it. The first reviews you scroll to are right. The characters keep you watching, the music is really fine. I am buying DVD for the music, too. Bruce at his best, altho walking thru it, and doesnt that make it even more fun!"
5,Red,"Just a great little movie to take you away from everyday stresses. Just enough humor, action, and done with taste."
4,You cannot go wrong,"This movie is great, it had a stellar cast, and was very funny. All the characters were great and it was well written. I really enjoyed this film. Films based on government conspiracies are usually dry and not funny this film breaks the mold."
5,A lot of fun to watch!,This movie was everything I had hopped the Expendables was going to be! A fun movie that handles aging action stars the right way. A good story with excellent actors doing what they do best. Just the right combination of humor and action. Bruce Willis really knows how to have a good time in front of the camera and he let's the audience share the moment.
5,Super Fun and Funny,"I love Bruce Willis, so I knew this had to be a good movie...and it was, there was plenty of Action and Comedy...the best combination ever Morgan F. and John M. were great also...it was just a great combination of people. You know sometimes how you watch those movies with too many popular people in it, and it just doesn't work...well, this isn't one of those movies...it's wonderful! :)"
5,RED Rocks!,"What a fun movie. We enjoyed this in the theatre and just had to own it. It is a lot of fun. Very entertaining. ""Can I kill her now?"" The Mythbusters would have fun with a number of the scenes in here, but that is what makes the movies so much fun."
5,Great movie saw in on the airplane and decided I WANTED IT,GREATMOVIE SAW IT WHILE TRAVELING ON r/r FROM IRAQ TO ECUADOR ENJOYED IT AND DECIDED TO PURCHASE IT.I would recommend it to all my friends.
5,Red DVD,"Great acting performance by Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and probably one of Bruce Willis' finest performances. The arrived as described within a a reasonable amount of time that was promised. Great purchase."
2,Red - Single Disc Bluray Edition,"I will keep this short. I bought the $12.99 Red Bluray mistakingly thinking that it would contain the DTS HDMA 5.1 audio track. But no, instead it has a Dolby Digital 5.1 compressed mix which falls well and truly below the audio mix on the 'collectors edition'. It is criminal to release a Bluray with a down sampled audio mix. So I started watching this movie feeling angry which probably did not help my initial impression. Overall, I thought it was a reasonable fun outing but nothing more than poking fun at the real action movies of the 80s. However, it is always great to see the ever likeable John Malkovich on the screen and I thought Helen Mirren did a wonderful job as the gun wielding lady.All in all 1/5 for releasing a bluray with a dirty old dolby digital track and 3/5 for the film."
2,Does not have lossless DTS Master Audio,"In this barebones edition, Summit decided to give us only lossy Dolby Digital, not DTS Master Audio,which is on the 2 disc special edition. I ordered this movie because of the low price and when I received the movie today, I was upset about the inferior audio on this disc. If I knew about the difference in audio, I would not have purchased this movie and would have waited for the price to drop on the 2 disc special edition. I am writing this review to help warn other audiophiles about this stupid decision by Summit. The rental discs at Netflix and Blockbuster will also have the inferior audio. You have been warned!"
2,Is this the face of modern cinema ?,"If you were ever groping for a reason to look back at older films (say pre 1979) , here's another excellent reason to abandon the slick ocean that is most mediocre (or less) modern film ."
5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"You are never too old to make a great action comedy, and Bruce Willis and John Malkovich prove that in RED. This wasn't just another shoot um up kill fest with a story you've seen a million times. RED is action packed, but it's also clever, exciting, and hilarious. It's a fresh movie in a typically repetitive genre. Honestly they don't get much better than this!"
5,"Bought as a gift, saw it in the theaters.","I bought this as a gift for a Bruce Willis fan. I saw this in the theatre and for my money, John Malkovich stole every scene he was in, you could spend 2 hours on way worse."
3,Action thriller with a bit of comedy between the explosions,"Not one of Bruce Willis' best. He plays a retired ""wet ops"" CIA man, and for some reason, the CIA is now set o terminate his retirement... and his life. Why? And when this affects his love interest and his old partners, it's time to get some payback.Classic wounded Willis, with some surprising costars making appearances. It's just the action plot of revenge following a setup is a bit overplayed."
4,Red?,"I kept hearing really bad reviews on this movie, but I am a Bruce Willis fan so I decided to try it anyway....an I'm glad I did! The movie was more of a comedy farce....but it was funny to me an I think they got away with what they were trying to pull off! The movie arrived on schedule an in great condition. If you're in to comedy I think you would get a kick out of this movie. I recommend it."
5,Great Movie,This Movie is the Best. Its so Funny. Its just one of those movies you can watch over and over.
5,RED,"Top notch movie. Great cast, great story, great entertainment. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes action/adventure w/ a bit of comedy here and there!Excellent movie"
5,Bruce at his best!,"Great action/comedy. Bruce Willis at his best both as an action hero and as a comedian. 4+ stars, just missed 5 stars because not enough of Morgan Freeman!!!"
5,Great movie,"Fun, funny - great cast of characters. Lots of surprises with the directions the story goes. Would definately recommend it."
2,An Action Comedy Without Action or Comedy,"Previews looked good for this movie. That's about all that is good. I was very disappointed. Just not what I thought it was. It took well over half an hour just for me to find one good thing in the movie. Then, it was flat-line. There are no realy highs or lows its just flat line."
2,I wanted to like this movie,"I really did. The premise was good, and I enjoyed the trailer. For me, where it went wrong, is the casting. Bruce Willis and Mary Louise Parker have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. That made the lines fall flat and turned this movie into a complete dud for me. The secondary characters (Helen Mirren in particular) were great, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie."
2,"goofy? no, just plain stupid","It is sad that so many excellent actors agreed to play for this pile of elephant dunk. I dont mind goofy movies, but they have to be smart to at least a small degree. The jokes and the humor in this production is just plainly stupid and not funny. We quit watching this in half time, bored and frustrated to tears."
4,"Corny, Fun, and Cool","This movie is corny, I'll get that out there, but at the same time it's fun to watch, seeing some of the older Hollywood actors and actresses come out to play in a corny-espionage type flick is just a fun time. Anyone who likes Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, or Hellen Mirren will love this movie."
4,Worth it,"I was not going to watch the movie thinking ""not another Bruce W movie"" .. then I was curious about the number of viewers giving it 4+ stars, I thought ""come on, they can't be all wrong?""I rented it... I was skeptical at first expecting to be disappointed ... then 5 minutes into the movie they got the first giggles out of me... then a few more smiles .. Then I became interested... and stayed so until the end.Light-hearted 50 -50 action comedy - good actors as usual boum boum bang bang... only done with a great sense of humor ... It is a feel good movie with tons of smiles... don't get me wrong, this is not a memorable movie, but a great weekend watch.A Must See =)"
4,"Enjoyable, fun movie","(No spoilers)We enjoyed it, loved the cast - we found the movie quirky and humorous, different from anything else we've ever seen, held our interest, and we had a good time watching it. Some things were predictable and some so off-the-wall no one could predict.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a different type of movie, it doesn't quite fall into any one category like action, adventure, fantasy, or romantic comedy, but is a little bit of all the above. Yes, we'd watch it again. It was great getting to see John Malkovich again after recently viewing Secretariat...we LOVED the pig! John is always such an intriguing actor. It was lovely to see Mary-Louise Parker whom I haven't seen since Fried Green Tomatoes, well played here as well, and she doesn't look like she's aged a bit!I'm glad this title came up in the most viewed VODs, thanks Amazon & fellow viewers. :)"
2,Major disappointment!,"This movie was a MAJOR disappointment - great cast, terrible screenplay. NO meat to this story. It relied solely on the draw of the ensemble cast. I feel bad for them that the story was so thin."
2,Hollywood vs CIA,"I know this is hard to believe, but Hollywood had made yet another anti-CIA movie. Let's see, evil VP who uses the CIA for personal hits, hmmmmm Cheney?? Dryfus, an oozing mass of Liberalism, hmmm he's in it too. Ok, Hollywood, we get it, the CIA and FBI are Evil! Lets dismantle them so our enemies can waltz in unencumbered. Hundreds may die but at least no ones civil rights will be violated."
4,Red - good movie,"Good movie - just because of the great actors. Not as great an action movie as I expected, but it was worth the money."
3,Beware no HD Sound,"Who would make a Blu Ray with no HD sound? - Summit would! I did not read the small print and bought the Movie Only Edition $7 cheaper, now I know why. If you only have an SD Sound system (Dolby Digital etc )it is fine.Audiophile beware!!"
1,Beware! Only Dolby Digital lossy audio on this release,"My one star rating applies to this blu-ray release only. I saw the film in theaters an it is entertainingly enough. But Summit studio apparently created this ""not so Special Edition"" primarily for the rental market and also for the budget market. It is barebones, almost no extra features, but even worse only has DVD quality Dolby Digital Audio as it is only on a 25GB single disc and there wasn't enough room to include much else. You have to buy the Special Edition to get lossless DTS-HD Master Audio and all the extra features. Shame on the studio for even releasing a blu-ray without the blu-ray standard of high-def picture AND high-def sound."
2,"Deceptive ""Movie Only""","The movie is really good but what they do not tell you is that this ""Movie Only"" edition is also ""Dolby only"". There is no Master audio or DTS here. The audio is sub-par. Get the full version if audio is important to you."
4,"Great movie, but ""movie only"" edition is an insult.",Lack of a lossless HD audio track is such a big turn off. Never would I think to double check the audio formats on a Bluray. Shame on Summit Entertainment!
4,good action movie delivers the thrills,"Red is a 2011 movie starring Bruce Willis, join malklovich and Morgan freeman. I picked up this movie looking for some good action I was pleased with the price only 7.50. My friends kept ranting and raving about how cool this movie was so I bought it. The movie was different violent and funny its a great Friday night movie pick. It was good to see Bruce Willis back in action he hadn't been in a movie since 2007's live free or die hard this a reallyawesome movie. Oh and if you like it the sequel comes out this August."
5,Whole family loves this movie,"Ages 11 to 19, all 4 kids love this movie, so do the parents, there is so much to laugh at, good stuff to talk about if we feel so inclined. Awesome effects, nice special features, John Malkovich, price is right, shipped promptly, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Red rules,"I have already seen the movie so I knew that when it went on sell that I would surly get it. It rocks with good action, a good story hook, and an awesome revenge plot."
4,Red,"Outstanding movie, A good light hearted film worth watching, especially if your into spy movies. The players in this film were and are outstanding."
4,"Silly, But Entertaining","I loved the first half of this film, then it got a little silly with the predictable Hollywood anti-CIA/government agenda but, overall, it was still a very entertaining film with wild characters. It's definitely something not to be taken the least bit serious, just enjoyed as a dark comedy with a fast-moving story and a good amount of action and intrigue.John Malkovich - no surprise - steals the show with his wacked-out, paranoid character ""Marvin Boggs."" Like Johnny Depp, Malkovich is very good at playing strange-but-always-interesting characters."
5,Red,"This was a good, fun movie. You can watch it over and over again. I bought it at Amazon.com great purchase."
3,What a cast,"There's nothing really special in this film. However, watching Willis, Freeman, and Malkovich in a single film is just enough."
5,good popcorn flick,"Good movie, very enjoyable action movie that had good surround sound audio to it. Looking forward to the confirmed sequel"
3,It was OK,"I had intended to see this movie in the theatre & somehow missed it. Turns out it was really a better movie for streaming (or DVD). It was just ok. I expected it to be funnier. The action was decent. More of a spoof-type movie to me, which brought a little more humor. I probably won't see it again any time soon..."
5,Love RED,"Loved the movie, funny, exciting and kept us on the edge or our seats. A great flic for an evening of fun."
3,Entertaining but not a great flick,"Enjoy watching the stars of this movie in other movies and the movie has it's cute moments, but it is a movie you will not want to watch over and over again. It's a one and done movie."
5,Entertaining!,Loved the movie. Helen Mirren is amazing and gorgeous! John Malkovich is brilliantly mad! Bruce Willis is typically incredible Bruce Willis. And Morgan Freeman is good ol' Morgan Freeman. A 5-star movie all the way!
5,Non-stop action..,"I liked this movie, although it looked silly. You can't really go wrongwith a cast like this. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, most of their moviesare good.This movie is unrealistic, just to let you know. But, it is funny andlots of action. We watched it as a family and everybody liked it."
5,A Fun movie,The actors are some of the best in the business so I knew it would be good. I didn't realize it would be funny and exciting too. Good Movie!
1,DECEPTIVE TACTIC! (re: movie only edition),"This is an insult, it really is. If there was no DVD of Red out there, and no special edition with everything, then ok, maybe they get away with this. But to deliberately put out this hacked version and not make it PAINFULLY OBVIOUS what you are getting...that is just low. I have no problem with the idea of having tiered levels of pricing for what you get (though I have to question the wisdom for everybody of having say, 3 different Blu Ray sku's for toy story 3), and even lo-res audio would be ok if it is CLEAR what you are getting...if you were being given an informed choice. And if the ONLY difference was audio, then you'd make an informed decision vs. the special edition, but no, it appears that its the other stuff that differentiates the two versions. It's just obviously and intentionally deceptive. My goodness, people who opt for Blu-Ray vs DVD want the whole deal for crying out loud...deceptive I tell ya!"
2,"In The ""Red""","Red has an all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Hellen Mirren, and Morgan Freeman, and was well received, so I expected better than what I got. What I got was just an average film with not enough action or comedy, and I thought this was supposed to be an action-comedy."
1,Audiophiles stay away !,"Bottom line...DO NOT BUY if you are an audiophile. This ""cheap"" version of RED does NOT contain DTS-HD MASTER 5.1 audio. It is only a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix. The more expensive version has the DTS-HD MASTER audio mix.Sorry people. I did not see the movie. i just want people to know who care about the audio/video to know what they are getting cause this small but big matter (to some people) is not really known. i just wanted to inform people."
2,I glad I did not pay to see this junk !,"I am so thankful that we consumers have more than one way to watch a movie like this what a dogAfter about 30 mins of this stupid dialog and decided to watch one of my old movies that you do not mind watching again. RED is a 1 time view at best poor acting, poor plots, goofy lines, I am afaid it only gets 2 stars or D and I am being kind at that and the movie makers can do better than this and until they do I will save my hard money for a truly excellent one."
2,lacking,the movie js slow paced and rather sloppy being that they are trained killers there are no real emotions. good thriller killer movies still find a way to weave emotions into the story. i suggest knight and day instead.
2,Red,"This movie features a wonderful cast of actors and a first-rate production, but cannot decide if it is a comedy or thriller or something else. It wavers between very slow paced dialogue and extremely fast paced action and explosive violence. Sometimes amusing and sometimes gripping as drama. But, it strays beyond the line of acceptability when the main character sways like a pendulum between sympathetic, invincible hero and cold-blooded, vengeful reactionary. Also, it goes beyond the implausible to the ridiculous in several places."
4,Maldova Sucks!,"This movie is very entertaining, even up to the closing credits. It makes you laugh and and root for the ""good"" bad guys."
5,LOVE this movie!!!,"Can't say enough about how much our entire family loves watching this movie over and over again. It's hilarious, action packed, has great dialogue and an awesome ensemble cast. But the most interesting thing about the Blu-Ray edition is listening to the ex-CIA agent's commentary about how the movie compares to the real world. There are some juicy tidbits included in there. Last but not least, I was going to say how I love Karl Urban, Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, but just adore the other main actors, too, so cannot leave out Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, and a wonderful cameo by Ernest Borgnine."
4,Old Agents having fun,"There is no end to the life of an agent of the shop, even those to whom retirement has become the new mode. Enter the bad guys and now we are off on a merry chase to discover why suddenly, these past specials are now on the terminate list. It is an interesting romp with just one bump in the road. Good movie."
4,Moldova Sucks!!!!,This was a fun popcorn movie. I enjoyed the action and I normally hate Mary-Louise Parker. Her acting is almost as bad as Sandra Bullock. But she had decent chemistry with Willis. The plot is simply bad but the actors is what makes this film. It really is a joy to watch all these old time favorite actors work with each other. I recommend for an action movie junkie or someone that enjoys watching a collection of good actors working together. Enjoy! oh and MOLDOVA SUCKS!
4,Bruce Willis is Red Hot as Always!,"Another action packed ride from him with plot twists at every corner! I thought the phone romance was sweet, and the fact that he had to abduct her to save her life (while putting it at risk) was also sweet, and crazy! It was a nice and crazy high risk romance, just like the ones she was always reading anyways! I half expected the ending to be her ""book"", lol. But the movie was top notch,primo actors all around, nice storyline, lots of exploxions and a decent storylines. You can't go wrong with Willis or Freeman! Definitly pick it up if you haven't already, worth the watch!"
1,RED the movie ouch !,"The film is a classic Brucie with lots of tongue in cheek jokes and basically a whole lot of blowing stuff up, however dont waste your money if you want the HD sound as this is only Dolby 5.1 -for me a big disappointment. The picture was pretty jerky also, great when it was steady but oh dear when it was not steady very distracting. Why sell a bluray without the better HD sound? BUYER BEWARE of this version and just go straight for the special edition."
2,RED,"Was looking forward to this, given the talented cast and reviews I had read. What a disappointment! So much potential, but this was just silly, cliche and extremely predictable. Looked like they had fun making this movie...glad somebody did."
1,Very disappointed,Very disappointed in this version I did not know you had to by the special edition so you could get DTS High def version. You only get the plain Dolby digital version with the single disk. I think Amazon could have made that clear.Just FYI
3,RED,"The strongest part of this movie is the cast. Its really good to see this group of actors playing together and they do a good job with what they have. When you first start to watch you think the movie is a serious action movie, but you soon realize there are a lot of comedic elements to the overall story. Some are funny, especially when it involves John Malkovich, while the rest detract from the movie. Its almost like the movie cant quite figure out whether it wants to be serious or funny, and mixing the two doesn't quite work.The story itself is nothing special, but the talented cast does a good job with it. The special effects are pretty good, though I questioned how they made going after the vice president look so easy. Overall RED is a good movie to watch if you just want to see a decent action movie with a few laughs, but don't expect much beyond that."
1,NO LOSSLESS SOUND! Beware...DON'T BUY!,This edition of the film only has lossy Dolby Digital sound. You have to buy the special edition to get a lossless DTS Master soundtrack. Shame on Summit!
4,Great popcorn film!,"This was one of those films that you watch after a hard day at work. If you are looking for realism, films and nearly all television is the wrong place to look. If you are looking to relax, be entertained, and have a few laughs this is a great choice!My favorite part of this film is Helen Mirren. Seeing such an elegant and accomplished actress saying 'I kill people daaaling', and soon after in snow fatigues carrying and shooting a sniper rifle (correctly).... and later firing a heavy weapon in a enclosed place (and in an evening dress), is worth buying the DVD!The only reason I didn't use FIVE stars is because there are a few (very few) parts that were too far fetched, even for this kind of film.... example Bruce Willis calmly stepping out of a car spinning out of control.... I HATE CGI car stunts!I bought it when it was more expensive, and it was worth it.... now it is a steal!"
2,blue rays region coded,"i saw the movie red at the cinema and thoroughly enjoyed it, as i saw it on amazon out earlier than australia and a lot cheaper as well. The only blue ray player i have is my ps3 but i thought it would still be ok! alas i was wrong it is region locked and will not play at all, in future might have to stick to just dvd format."
1,red,i would gladly review this film if i ever receive it.....i try to find out wher it is but no success.....
3,Not Too Good!!!,"I never read the comic books, so I couldn't compare it. I didn't really like this movie as well as I thought I would. There were a few decent action scenes that caught my attention. The rest of the story just has them talking. Frank Moses, Joe Matheson, Marvin Boggs, and Victoria are retired CIA agents. They are soon targeted for assassination. They must team up and work together to figure out who wants to kill them and why. Frank brings along a woman named Sarah who is his 'sorta-kinda' girlfriend. Don't expect too much while seeing this movie. If you want a bland action film to only see maybe once or twice in your life, you might like RED!!!"
1,Waste of time,"Worst movie I've seen in awhile - and I'm counting the movies on LMN. It's predictable, corny, and boring. The first 1/4 of the movie seemed somewhat tolerable, but it never got any better. I'd rather be stuck in traffic for 3 hours than watch this movie again."
5,"Brilliant, Superb, Amazing and lots of FUN","Amazing movie. Just saw it over the weekend at Amazon VOD with no idea about this movie, ordered cause I felt the preview was nice and I was blown out with the movie. Highly recomended to watch it atleast once.Fantastic Action, Brilliant Actors, a simple story but put very well. It's a big screen movie."
4,Funny movie,"If you like a mix of action and comedy, this movie is a good bet. While the story line is a bit of a stretch, following former CIA agent Frank Moses out of retirement and teaming up with his old gang to find out who is out to kill them is a pure joy. A lot of the humor is dry, but works well with the story. There is plenty of action and shooting as well as humorous situations they gang finds themselves in. I am definately recommending this movie."
4,A great action movie that hope hits Amazon Streaming soon!,A great action movie that hope hits Amazon Streaming soon! This was mfun and fast and funny while still being exciting. A great flick. Highly Recomended - M.R.
4,Very funny,I loved all the actors in this movie and you can tell that they all had a pretty good chemistry between one another
5,Great movie,This movie was well worth the money. It had comedy. It had action. It just had everything I look for in a movie
5,RED,"""Red"" is the greatest movie we have seen in a long time. We have probably watched it 5 times already..Stars, plot & comedic touches are absolutely superb.."
4,ED RED,"Very funny spoof of action thrillers with an ALL-STAR cast. Do YOU remember Ernest Borgnine? He looks great. Wouldn't recommend doing this at home, of course, but one of the better old-guys-rock comedies."
2,Appropriate for older children only,Nice book with lots of ideas on how to explain to your child about the upcoming arrival of a new sibling and activities to do with your child etc. Only problem is that your child would have to be pretty old to be able to use this book. I think 4 years old but maybe as young as 3. Certainly not appropriate for under 3. So if you've spaced your kids 2 years apart or so then this would not work for you.
1,"Looks nice.. Poor quality, failed within a day - Did not even play with it.",Very sad with this purchase. First time I buy something that lasts for a day... I should've done more research.. it turns out these low quality chinese guns are well know to fail often... Sellers should not even keep them in their catalog unless they want to risk the bad rating to go from the product to themselves. I hope I'll be able to get good treatment with the seller on returning this out.
4,Inexpensive yet pretty amazing.,"This airsoft gun was pretty cheap in the world of airsoft weapons but I was awe struck at what my money got me. lots of gadgets for it, however all of them can be put on the gun easily... i didn't even look at the directions.It shoots pretty darn well too. The pellets fly out of this thing. I have to do some adjustment to the gun as they curve a little bit so hoping once I do that there will be no more curving of the pellet. Looking forward to getting out there and using it soon!"
2,Three weeks of Fun only!,"Bought this for my 12 year old son and he used it and loved it, but that lasted only about three weeks. Order it on the 5th of may 2012 and received it 10 days later. Not bad, but on monday 6/4/12 The gun started making a strange sound when the trigger is pulled,like something is not engaging and it does not shoot anymore. Very upsetting for the kid. When it works though it's a great gun and alot of fun. I suggest spending a little more for a quality product if any out there. China is all over the place. What a shame! Will call the company/Amazon and will comment later on their response.I think it should be replace or a refund issued!!! Thanks"
4,Great Except...,"I thought that it was great when I first bought it. All of it except it DID NOT come with the laser,flashlight, and their batterys. I just hate the magazine I press the button by accident and all the BB's came out and I had a really hard time with it. Sometimes it won't shoot any BB's when it still has some ammo in it. Everything is fine but the ones I had listed."
4,M82 reveiw,to start this off with its a great gun for beginners i highly recommend it for beginning with the laser you have to set it yourself the scope is OK i was using it for night ops and then one time the scope fell in water other then that it was great and accurate the flashlight was great i could see people up to 50 ft the silencer was fake like every other silencer for airsoft but was a cool attachment the battery charges for 4 to 5 hours and last me for 10 hours the gun itself is pretty accurate. its probably 220 250 fps the auto is great your not running from the spray lol the semi is great if your like me and have a trigger finger =] the stock is not adjustable it folds and locks thegun is abs plastic the inside parts are metal. the mag doesn't hold that much you might want to buy a couple spare mags.i hope this helped you alot
3,Screw Fell Off,Some limited use has gone well except for a screw holding the barrel cover coming loose and falling off. We'll need to use thread lock on the remaining screw (since there are two serving this purpose) and see if we can find a replacement at Home Depot or Lowe's.
3,Needs more ammo,"The gun came complete and was easy to assemble. We actually bought three to try out. As nice as this gun was, taking a 40-bb clip to compete with other guns is like taking a knife to a gunfight."
2,NOT GOOD,"This gun broke the second day after it came. First of all it didn't come with the leaser pointer, then the flashlight fell apart (good while it lasted) then it ran out of battery, so I charged it for 2 hours 30 minutes, but the whole time the charger light never even turned on. Then the stock broke. It couldn't stay, it just kept swinging. I was planning on just cutting the stock off so I could use it as a video prop (Youtube: ChazDirects) but after I spent 50 bucks, it just wasn't worth it. And it only shot about 225 FPS, not 350. I'm giving this a 2 star because for the day it lasted it worked well."
1,THIS GUN SUCKS,I AM TELLING U THIS IS THE WORST GUN EVER EVEN FOR A CHEAP PRICE THE GUN IS TERRIBLE FIRST OF ALL IT ONLY HOLDS 3O AND I KNOW U CAN GET A BETTER GUN BECAUSE MY BROTHER GOT A DIFFERENT GUN FOR THE SAME PRICE AND IT HOLDS 600 BULLETS AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON HOW TO RELOAD IT YOU HAVE TO RELOAD IT LIKE U IN THE 1800 JUST DONT BYE THIS GUN OR ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER O AND THE SHIPPING IS LIKE A WEEK!!!!!
1,don't buy this gun!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this gun is inaccurate, not powerfull, ugly, and cheap. take it from a experianced buyer"
3,quality even if lacking in power,"I have had this gun for almost 10 months. I was my first Automatic electric Gun (AEG). At first i was not disappointed. It is very accurate and shoots almost 75 feet. However, when i got my neighbors together to test out my new purchase i was sad. The gun is almost worthless in a backyard war because it can barely make it to your target. The Fps is to low to consider it a primary.The Accessories are pretty nice. A little cheap but still fun to use.Silencer- simply for looks provides little use except as an extension of barrelLight-exciting for night warsLaser-DON'T USE DURING A WAR. If shined in a eye can cause blindness.Scope- I don't use but does not magnify at all.HOP UP- The vibrations from the gun moves the switch alot.I would recommend buying a spare clip because the gun only holds 30-35 bbs. Plus they can attach to each other for easier access.OVERALL- Although fun and exciting this Low power AEG does not meet my needs and i'm looking for a stronger gun."
3,Nice gun!,"Nice gun for the money. Fires single or rapid fire; however, it's rapid fire will eventually jamb the gun. I would have given it a 5* except that the barrelsnapped off too easily, and while it still shoots, you need to screw out the barrel to get to the battery. Good velocity of bb's."
3,Great but slow,"This is a great gun but it's a low fps for me. The mag holds like 35 which I don't like, but overall it's a pretty good gun."
4,a good beginner gun,"when i got this gun i was so excited, but then after i used it for a while i started to notice that when you shoot long range it curves WAY up, but i would recommend this gun to any beginner.it also has a lazer (really good), a scope (also good), and a flashlight that looks crappy but is really good for airsofting at night"
1,"Gun showed up broken, Amazon wouldn't help","Bought the gun for my son's birthday. Showed up with a broken stock as the clip keeping it locked was broken. Still decided to use it. After about 30 minutes, the gun stopped shooting. The battery won't charge now. Tried to get the issue resolved. Got the wrong supplier information from Amazon, spent 4 months trying to resolve it only to finally find out I have the wrong supplier. I then contacted the correct supplier, only to be told by Amazon that I didn't contact the supplier in the first 15 days. Very disappointed in the product and Amazon."
4,Good for the price,"It's got a nice weight to it and while it's made of all plastic, it still feels alright. Doesn't feel really cheap. The laser sight and red cross sight are off and while can be adjusted, can't be adjusted to the right position . The flashlight is fine (although the only thing that does feel kinda cheap) and the handle/grip you can attach to the front is sturdy and goes on easy.The magazine I had problems with at first. First off I broke it somehow, and the little plastic knob thing that pushes the BBs up flew out and so did the spring. I managed to fix it and since then it hasn't done it again. Another thing though is occasionally i'd be loading the magazine with the speed loader and when I was done any little bump would send the BBs flying out and everywhere. Hasn't done that recently either, but I still try to keep my thumb over the hole to prevent it.Haven't owned an airsoft gun before, but i'm happy with this one, good for the price"
5,BEST GUN EVER!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best gun ever it can make my friends cry!The range is one of best parts of the M82.The scope is so cool if you twist the bottom part on the top a little red cross appears.This gun is the best in backyard battles so if you like backyard battles you should buy this gun!It should be cost more money instead of $40 it should be at least $60 if you ask me!But if you buy this gun buy so 6mm bb's.Only charge the battery for 3 to4 hours or else it will break the battery.PLEASE BUY THIS GUN YOU WON'T RECRET BUYING THIS GUN SO BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,double eagle,The gun is ok it lacks distance and accuracy. it doesnt get that much range either. i dont really recommend this gun
4,Good begianner level gun.,"I have been very pleased so far with this gun. I bought it for my son for Christmas 2012. It has met all the expectations of how it was described. Everything is very easy to use, from getting the battery in and out for charging, load the bb's, (using a different quick loader, Metaltec speed loader, the one that came with it.......not so good), to putting on the attachments. All the attachments are fine except the sight. The cap where you turn it on and off, also is where you have to change the battery for the sight. It becomes lose after just a short while and tends to fall off. Needless to say, it has fallen off and is now lost. But all,of that is just extra stuff for looks only in my opinion, and the gun itself has worked great. Over all, I would buy this gun again and would recommend it to others."
1,"IT SUCKS/DO NOT BUY, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","THIS GUN IS TERRIBLE,the first day I got the gun it broke then, the battery broke, it would not charge, then the automatic broke because when I went to put it on one shot it went on automatic and so on and so on. IT'S CRAPY I WOULD PUT IT TO ZERO STARS IF I COULD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,lol...,"Well this gun is... umm i guess alright. i had this gun for about 6 months and i airsoft alot with my friends.. this gun probably has about 200 fps and it sucks most of my guns are 400-475 fps. So i was pretty much dissapointed. the stock broke like the first day and the handle too. One good thing is the red dot laser has pretty good accuarcy. and also this guns clip spring breaks easily so i bought like 2 clips -.-"" i only use this gun to scare my dog and just play around and pretty cheap except the shipping. not reccommended for pro airsofters"
2,dont buy,this gun does not hold enough bullets because it depletes in seconds. it was not worth the price i paid.
1,worst gun on the market,"worst gun you'll every buy. doesnt even shoot far. my friend bought 3 of them and they all suck. all double eagle guns are terrible. everyone of them! if u want a good gun, buy a G&G Combat Machine selling for about 140 on airsoft mega store. get a real airsoft gun, not a fake plastic peice of crap like the one above."
3,cool gun,This is a very cool looking gun!! The laser wires were broken in the package too clse to splice back together. No glasses in box. Reloading is very slow you have to use a long tube that holds about 30 bbs and a ram rod to refill the clip. over all feel of the gun is great power is good. Amo runs out fast buy extra clips.
5,Works good indoors,Cheaply made but for the price that's what you would expect. Good for indoor simulated close quarters combat or for shooting your friend while he sleeps.
4,Good,"The gun is great. The accuracy is a little off, but overall acceptable. The gun itself feels real, not flimsy or fake. Buy it."
2,It's Okay if you just want a toy to play with,"This ""Airsoft gun"" Is not anything that you would want to use in any war, I would suggest this for your 10 year old that wants a toy gun, But not for actual fights. This gun would be nice for a ten year old because it doesn't hurt at all. I had on my shoe that's very thin, and shot myself from point blank range and i barely felt it! It also gets jammed allot if your shooting it you have to take the clip out and dump some bbs and then fire again. SO any real airsofters out there i recommend you save up for something else like the G&G m4 machine. I wish I had my money back"
2,Important plactic piece broken upon arrival.,My son was so excited to get this airsoft gun. The piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the gun open was broken off. The gun keeps closing while my son is trying to use it. It is rediculous. Never heard back from them. Very dissappointed in their service.
3,Great gun for kids,"This a great gun as long as you don't plan on battling in a large scale airsoft war. Its great for very close quarters combat. If you are looking at participating in pro fights or you want something you can upgrade get something with a metal gearbox as this has a non-upgradeable plastic gearbox. Also check out forums such as [...] to get a understanding of how the airsoft world works. Decent gun for kids though. Very durable, although the stock broke first game which seems to be a common problem."
3,baseball66,ok gun i guess but the mag only holds like 30 bbs it shoots around 150-200 good for CQC but i think you could get it for a much better price than 50$+shipping it is made out of plastic but has a strong structure i dropt mine and the stock came off my dad was really pised it is good for beginers but i take airsoft pretty seriously i'v had just about 20 guns and i'm still looking for a new one if you want a pistol buy the colt delta elite it is so far the best gun i'v ever had even though it is clear DO NOT SPRAY PAINT IT ANY COLOR.
2,Not so great,I guess for the money it is just so-so. Really disappointed in the looks and quality compared to comparably priced AEGs.
4,"Great, but could be better","It is a great gun it shoot's moderately hard, it has a lot of attachments and its a great gun if you want a BB gun really badly and you don't want your parents to know. It has lots of great things like a flash light, scope, silencer, folding stock and more. Unfortunately my gun didn't come with a laser, but I'm having lots of fun without it. The BB gun has a great feel to it and its not shaky at all their was no loose parts. If you want a BB gun that doesn't break the bank i would definitely check this gun out. It is a perfect beginners gun."
2,Unreasonable Shipping,"But the worst part is that since the shipping is unreasonably high and non-refundable and you must also pay return shipping it makes returning the gun not worth it. In my opinion, HotImportToys knows this and it is part of their business strategy so that you won't return their JUNK guns. Look through some of their other items and see how unreasonably high the shipping is on their items.After buying close to two dozen airsoft guns over the past two years I will not buy airsoft guns online unless the fulfillment is done through Amazon."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"(NOTE: this review is by my 11 year old son- I bought the gun on his behalf) I was pretty excited at first because it looked cool but then when I actually put bullets in it , it stopped at about 30 fires- I took out the clip and it was empty. It is not worth 28 bucks. You would be better off just buying a different gun. The only other solution would be to buy more clips but they're like 8 bucks each so you would have to spend like another 20 bucks just for more clips. The clip is also very difficult to load. All this is why I was not impressed and believe me just dont buy this gun its not worth 28 bucks."
2,Double Eagle M2 Automatic,Disappointed in product. Gun not easy to handle.Battery charger was broken when we received it.Husband had to reattach wires etc...Should have sent it back.
3,Fast & Easy Read - A Small Book,"This book has general information about selling books on the internet. It is a fast and easy read at about 125 pages. It will help you to get started. However, you will need additional resources. Other good books are available and there is much information to be found directly online. Have fun!"
2,BARE BONES INFO FOR A NEWBIE DOT.COM BOOKSELLER,"SUZANNE PITNER HAS WRITTEN A BOOK THAT IS SOMEWHAT OVER PRICED AT $14.95, ESPECIALLY WHEN ADDING TO THAT THE COST OF SHIPPING. IN NO CHAPTER OR PARAGRAPH DOES SHE GO INTO MUCH DETAIL, ALTHOUGH THERE IS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO PUT THE WANNABE BOOKSELLER TO THINKING. ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MORE GUIDANCE FROM A BOOK TITLED ""YOUR GUIDE..."""
1,Ehh -- Not so much,"More properly titled: ""How to make money selling a book with a title suggesting people can make money selling books with no effort"""
1,General Information,The information contained in this book can be found in 5min on any search engine.
3,Guess it was good ...,"Lost it in Hurricane Katrina before I got a chance to read it! But at the time, the information seemed relevant."
2,I would not recommend this book,"The book is ok, if you have extra money to spend and you want to read all there is. But, I can not recommend it for Amazon or other sellers like Half or ABE, because it is totally outdated. It was probally a good starting book in it's time, as it was written in 2002. There are some other books much better written and much more content. I would not waste my money. Sorry!"
1,Not a good book,"I had read and enjoyed a recent Douglas Kennedy book and, being from Australia and having lived in the places depicted in The Dead Heart, I was expecting it to be interesting and well written. My expectations were not realised.I can only assume that Mr Kennedy's literary skills have improved significantly since this (apparently his first published novel) was written. The Dead Heart had unbelievable, one dimensional characters and the depiction of northern Australia was so removed from reality as to make me think Mr Kennedy had neither been there, nor conducted any basic research, before he wrote this book.This is a book to be avoided."
2,not a sound investment,"The purchase of this book was a horid mistake. Only people who either want to learn a VERY little bit of VB or have cash to burn (in which case you should e-mail me for some ideas) should buy this book. There are other books which have a much lager, more usefull, scope. The book does hold your hand throughout the proccess, but it never lets go. The pace is way to slow, even for the newest newbie. The authors must have had elementary school children in mind while editing. It's more of a kids picture book than a textbook. Trust me... don't waste your money!!"
4,It could move faster,"I am using this book along with a university course in VB6. I find the book helpful and clear, although maybe TOO clear. I mean, once you learn really basic simple stuff like how to draw buttons and place items on a form, I think that they should then drop the painful step-by-step instructions on how to do those things once you get to later chapters and move on to the CODE (the new stuff). Other than that I find the book very helpful."
3,My opinon on this head band,"This head band is a colored cottan band. It is okay if you just want color on your head for fashioh or looks, but it has no absorbtion ability and is worthless to stop the sweat from running down your face if you are working hard. If pretty is your objective then that works."
3,Ruined by Fable Insertion,"While a good recipe compendium, only 3 stars since the Politically Correct Marxists from the Monticello Foundation had to insert the mythical garbage of Sally Hemings into this book.There is not a scintilla of proof that Mr Jefferson cavorted with Sally Hemings, and as a matter of fact, Hemings and her mother Betty were promiscuous and had many fathers to their huge broods. Stop smearing Thomas Jefferson with this lie..he gave 40 years of his life to America and without his assistance, George Washington would have never won his important battles as Jefferson procured funding and guns.gunpowder for his victories. Enough on this yellow journalism that is evil."
2,sketching,"Although his anatomy instruction is wonderful, this one however is not. True to it's title, what you get is a book full of sketches with no instruction whatsoever. Overall it's generally worthless."
4,A Great Resource!,"Excellent book for those coping with abuse, those helping others to cope and those educating others. What is most helpful are the characteristics and stories that help you and others identify abusive behavior. I think should be a mandatory read for all females at some point in their lives, hopefully earlier than later."
4,Emotionally Abused,Good book. Very helpful and necessary for the education and empowerment of all abuses because they all start with emotional abuse.
5,A must read book for anybody in an abusive relationship,It was a very good book..really helped identify personality types and triggers. A great self help guide. i would highly recommend this book to anyone looking 4 help 2 recognize and heal from abuse.
4,Insightful,Definitely and eye opener to what women (or men) can experience. Heart breaking. But very well written. I would recommend this to everyone to help someone else or even yourself.
2,Flawed premise,"While this book touches on many truths regarding emotionally abused women and thier abusers, it starts from a flawed premise. That premise being that ALL emotionally abused women were abused as children in one way or another and that is why the woman choses abusive partners and even friends all through her life. Not ALL women who are emotionally abused come from an abusive childhood, to say so is an irresponsible commentary on the subject. I find the book ""Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men"" by Lundy Bancroft a more in depth and on target handling of the subject."
5,This book heal my wounded soul!,"This book challenged me to be more assertive toward my abuser. It also made me realize that I am not alone going through this abuse. It also helped me to see what kind of abuser my father really was. I had to look deep inside myself because of the pain that I have endured. Most of all this book helped me to move beyond my pain and accept it as being real. I thought to myself that this is how a parent was supposed to parent a child. Boy, was I wrong! Any woman that has gone through this abuse needs to get this book for their well being. I also found out within myself the traits that I got from the abuser and that I can change the way I act toward other people in a meaniful way! This book was a life saver! The author knows what she is talking about! This book lets me be myself and it gives me hope. There is light at the end of the tunnel!"
1,I want the hours back that I spent reading this,"Psychobabble. I have been in an emotionally abusive relationship. My ""inner child"" didn't need to go on a quest backward through time to find my ""original abuser."" The simple fact is that I fell in love with a guy that over time could be a real jerk. It took time for me to realize that the good times, which did outnumber the bad times, were so qualitatively bad that no amount of love was worth. Period. End."
3,CoDependency? I think not...,"Personally, I believe this book and other ""older"" domestic abuse/violence books linger a bit too long on the idea of codependency. I do not think abused people are necessarily co-dependent (although some are). Nevertheless, it is one I read and benefited from when I was deciding whether or not to leave my husband."
2,Fix the abuser not the abused,There is nothing wrong with you for still loving someone who is abusive. Emotional abuse is not the victims fault. You can help your abusive partners narcissism by forming a support network and limiting their abusive behaviour. If I had followed the advice in this book I would have lost my family. My husband is better now. Get a different opinion from someone who saved her marriage and didn't take years to heal. [...]
5,The Emotionally Abused,"Received item as described, fast delivery, will purchase from vendor againThank youM Haynes"
4,Not everyone is abused as a child,"This book was good and helped me alot to deal with an abusive husband. It answered many questions for me and helped me to move forward. However, the book always went back to the abuse beginning in childhood...I don't feel that is true for everyone. I wasn't abused as a child but I have been emotionally abused by my husband for 25 yrs, since I married young maybe that could count....regardless, this book is a great start for dealing with an abusive person in your life."
2,Book review,"I got this book to learn something new about overcoming obstacles. I had to give this 2 stars because only the last chapter talks about this (the last 40-50 pages). The majority of the book gives case examples of abuse. This might be a good book for someone who is just realizing that they are a survivor of abuse, and wants to read about others who have gone through the same or similar circumstances.The book also assumes that once abused, an individual will always choose abusive relationships, which I find extremely untrue. That is a harsh generalization, but the author continues on with this premise throughout the entire read. I had to skip around because of this."
5,Excellent starting point for the emotionally abused.,"This book is wonderfully helpful! It can be really hard to understand that you are abused when it's not physical. Because the bruises are not visible you can fool yourself into thinking that you're crazy for feeling like a victim.This book helps you delve into:1. types of abuse2. types of victims3. types of abusers4. why we keep repeating patterns5. how to break those patterns6. how to recover from the abuse and make a healthier and happier life for yourself.Written in plain language, easy to read and relate to the text. Lots of good examples. This is a great tool. There are special assignments throughout the book to do as tools for recovery as well as a good resource page. I totally want the rest of her books now!"
5,This Author's Books Are A Do Not Miss,"If you or a loved one is suffering from an inability to identify they are in an abusive relationship, this is a ""do not miss"" read. All of this author's books are excellent to help empower an individual to take her/his power back from a controlling and/or abusive person. I recommend it/them to my clients."
3,Why are you selling used ones?,This product is known to fail. Why do you sell used ones or returned modules as new. I bought one that was more than likely returned by somebody else and it was already fried. A lot of help that is!
5,a baby boy pleaser,"This is the first book my one year old boy responded to. We have three of these books, and he likes them all, but this one is his favorite. He brings this book to us to read at least twice a day and doesn't seem to tire of seeing the bunny pop up at the end. It has chunky pages, so he can turn them himself, and the pop ups are rugged enough that he can manipulate them without destroying the book. This is especially good for Sean, who likes to do things himself. I highly recommend this book!!"
3,"Used book: torn a bit, not in description","I ordered two books. I knew the books were used, so I wasn't expecting them to be in top condition, but descriptions said they would not be torn or ripped. First book was fine and I was pleased with it. The second book, ""ARe You There Bunny?"" was torn on the last page so you couldn't see most of the picture (it was a board book for kids)."
1,"save your money, buy something else","Anything else! This book is poorly written and poorlyresearched. And let's not talk about the editing.It is difficult to believe that authors willingly puttheir names on this.Yes, it's that bad."
5,NOT SAD BLUES -- BUT BLUE LIKE THE OCEAN OR A CLEAR SKY!,"Wow!!!! I slept on this album initially, but I am glad I came to my senses. It is wonderful. Nancy returns to her earliest roots. She is paired with big bands and much smaller ensembles. Her voice has attained a deep older texture - like a fine wine. This production reminds me of Sarah Vaughan's late production Crazy and Mixed Up (1982). Both albums boast the talents of artists with tons of experience and nuance. Another comparison: the later work of Shirley Horn. Buy this. You will love it!"
5,I'm devoted to this paper...,"This paper is amazing. I use it with my Epson printer and the photos and digital art comes out amazing in quality, richness and beauty. I don't get the same level is quality prints with any other paper than this one. The thickness/weight is also great for a photo paper (heavier than your typical store bought photo paper). Highly recommend!!"
3,Step Party 2,"I have been stepping for years, but on a consistant basis for about a year now. The Step Party 2 was a very intense work out and it got me sweating but, Katina does not give good instructions on the step movements she is doing. They are very complicated and I had to actually watch the video a couple of times to get the steps half way down. I feel there was not enough intruction on the movements therefore,I think this is a great purchase for an advanced stepper, but beginner and intermediates will have a hard time following her."
4,Juan Torres,"If you love 4-piece bands with a sensitive musician playing romantic music on a Hammond organ, then this is the music for you."
5,Essential for Dogs fans and the perfect intro for others,"Full of cockney wit, this 20 song collection comprises the Dogs' singles aswell as other previously unreleased material. The singles are largely easy to listen to, with catchy choruses and some great riffs, together with tender moments like the timeless Empty World. The second side is better though. Full of energy these songs stand out as amongst Tyla's best. Pourin' out my heart and Chains particualy shine for me. This is one of my favourite albums, and proves that the Dogs' energy and attitude warranted more recognition ( and adulation) than they got. Doug"
3,HK Customer service the worst possible,"Okay, H/K may make a product that is capable of reproducing the best sound, but if something ever goes wrong with it you are up a creek. I had an FL 8550 that went on the fritz. It sat in the shop for a month untouched due to the fact that they could not get parts for it. Finaly H/K agreed to get me a new one. Unfortuntely this took over a month as well. After working with Scott Snyder, and Marry Beth Chronan, of Harman Kardon, I am convinced that the entire customer service lacks all knowledge of how to serve their customers. One would think a company that makes such a high status product would be capable of serving their customers. Unfortunately I will never again purchase a Harman product again. This includes all Infinity and JBL products as well."
1,don't buy this,"this is one real annoying piece of electronics. The carousel takes forever. Each time you turn it on it flips through all 5 CDs. So forget about just turning it on and listening to music. Who would want to do that? Instead it is turn it on, wait and listen to whirring noises.The player gets stuck on lots of new CDs including CDs I just listened to in my car. Some I've tested on a boom box immediately and found them to be fine. It will get stuck on one of the five CDs in the carousel more or less every time.Don't buy it."
2,Another Word of Warning,"I'm afraid I'm forced to echo some of the negative reviews that appear here. Though I have had no trouble with customer service ( a problem mentioned in another review here), I have had to contact them far too often. I am on my second FL 8370. My first one had to be returned due to a skipping problem. The second one has the same problem, and, as a bonus, the CD drawer does not work properly. In short, in spite of undeniably excellent sound, this CD player has been nothing but trouble."
1,AVOID this POS - can there be a negative star rating???,"Steer a thousand miles from this POS. The manual is worthless. The troubleshooting help is equally worthless. Don't try the HK website for any help because it's nothing more than an online version of the worthless manual. Don't bother looking for a customer service phone number - it's nowhere to be seen on the website or the manual. They'll direct you to ""local"" authorized service centers. I called several in the middle of the day on a Friday and there was no answer, no voice mail, no nothing. I'll certainly never buy another HK anything."
4,Very sweet book,This book is a great bedtime book. It follows Grover's bedtime ritual and makes it easier to wind a wild one down. It's also short enough so that reading it repeatedly is not a problem.
5,"A different approach, with excellent results","I bought this method after reading the reviews, and I was not disappointed. The approach is different, as it relies on memorizing patterns and then mixing them up to produce an original line. It is hard work doing each exercise thoroughly, but I am about 1/3 through, and the result is there. Highly recommended."
4,Useful/Practical Approach,"Let me qualify this by saying I am not a bass player, nor do I aspire to be. I do however have a need to record credible basslines for my guitar soloing. In that regard, this book fits like a glove. There is no unnecessary theory or confusing sidetracks to the goal of playing credible jazz basslines. The book is easy to read,(spiral bound so it opens completely), with large notes. Each jazz standard offers a different lesson which is an ingeniously effective device. This book would have gotten 5 stars from me if it weren't for the small number of typos I found. Most of these are obvious,(page 23, 1st note under a B flat major 7th chord is obviously not going to be a B natural) but perhaps I'm being too hard on the book. It's been said that any fool can make a complex subject complex but it takes a genious to make the complex simple. This is probably the only book on bass guitar I will ever need for my purposes and so I thank you Jay for that !"
5,"If you want to walk, the only book you will need.",I've been trying to move into Jazz BeBop from a Rock and Blues background and have tried other books. This is the first book I've found comprehensive enough to answer all my questions and get me there. It has section for beginers and enough material at the end to work refining your skills for a couple of years. Best book out there for Walking Jazz Bass.
3,Word games,"Definitely not for 9 year-olds! This is a book of lists and word games - trivia games, fill in the blanks, etc. Not stand-up-and-run-around games, but sit-down-and-write-the-answer games. For adults, might be fun, especially if you were into Trivial Pursuit. As a teaching tool or brain-teaser, OK. For a kids party, un-fun."
3,"Not so great, buy the originals.","Anything Jean Luc Ponty I'd say is incredible and inspiring...except this CD. I was very dissappointed in the performance of the music in this live CD!! And it's not the fault of Jamie Glasier, Jean Luc Ponty, Baron Browne, nor the keyboardist. It's the drummer!!! Chris Barsimanto. I read the review stating that his drumming is rock solid. I have to kindly disagree. He can't keep up!! Listen to the intro of ""After the Storm"" and you'll know what I mean. I'm glad he wasn't on any other recordings with Jean Luc Ponty. I don't recommend this CD because the music sounds labored and unfocused. I do recommend the Live Concert recently put out on DVD. That band is phenominal!! If you like the songs in ""Chene Park"", I suggest you buy the originals because this one just doesn't live up to Jean Luc Ponty's standards."
2,Terrible drumming,"The drummer on this CD, Michael Barsimanto, is much better when playing rock music. He seems to not know the music very well here, also. His playing is very sloppy, especially when he tries to use fills to accent the solos, often ending before the beat. Very sloppy indeed. I find this album hard to listen to for this reason especially, but also for the terrible mix. The drums are too loud in the mix, and the audience sounds as if it were added in later.Ponty's solos seem tired on this CD. The only standout soloist is Jamie Glaser this time around. Chris Rhyne (on keys) doesn't even sound like the Chris Rhyne of old - he just goes through the motions, playing forgettable jazz cliches on piano.I love Ponty's output - except for this one. Much better is his first live album for Atlantic - simply titled, ""Live"". Pick it up!"
5,Young Adult Novel,"I have not in fact read Young Adults, but i have read Young Adult Novel, and have been thrilled time and again by discovering the real-life Dada basis for the boys' antics. If you can get this book for less than five novels, that alone would make it worth five stars. I am myself buying this book, and i suggest anyone with a sense of humor do the same."
3,Thanks For Reading,"As the author of this encyclopedia on Southern Gospel, I welcome any corrections anyone has to offer. Anyone who can show any information to be inaccurate is encouraged to write me using the contact information printed in book's ""Introduction"" section.I have found a few minor errors of a typographical nature since publishing the book. It has also been called to my attention that a couple of dates are off by one year. However, the overall accuracy of the book has yet to be challenged by any credible Southern Gospel music historian or critic.(Please note, when writing this ""review,"" I rated the book at three stars so as to not artificially inflate the book's rating.)Thanks for reading."
3,Prosecutor/Writer glosses over a fascinating subject,"This book, co-written by the US Attorney who prosecuted the man who built the so-called Empire Of Deceit, tells the story of the largest bank embezzlement in American history. As thorough as it is, the book turns into a bit of a legal brief in its later chapters (as most true crime books do, when it's time to get in a courtroom and make the bad guys pay), and ultimately fails to capture the complex character of Harold A. Smith - boxing promoter, womanizer, real-life SuperFly, con man, and thief of over 21 million dollars of Wells Fargo's money. An interesting read if you want to learn about the intricacies of bank fraud or the weak ""insiders"" required to pull it off. A disappointing read if you want to learn anything of substance about Smith, the man this book accurately refers to as ""perhaps the greatest swindler of all time""."
2,The true about Italians in the II war,"It is historically correct and witten by one of the protagonist, but this book deserve a special attention because it tells a lot about the character of the italian people, in a war they found themselves totally unprepared, in spite to the decision to engage it. Nevertheless the spirit of inventive, fantasy and individuality made out some remarkable points in light of the extremely scarce resources."
3,Maybe 3 and a half,"I agree that this is a very good score, and deserves more than three stars. But four? I don't think it's quite at that platau. The main theme (Tracks #1 and the beginning of #18 are really pretty, and a lot of the other music captures the granduer of the twisters as well. It moves along very nicely, and is upbeat, without being mood music. A soundtrack definitely worth getting in my opinion, and a very good one at that. But when comparing it to other scores I would rate 4 and 5 stars, it just doesn't quite make it. But don't take my word for it, see for yourself...."
5,amazing,"This was a beautiful cd, the music was just wonderful. I like the feeling of butterflies in my stomache, and the goosebumps I get on my skin. If you like that type of thing, then this is the cd for you. It was just wonderful."
5,Terrific soundtrack!,"I liked this CD from the first song. Mark Mancina did an excellent job of composing these songs. Twister is a naturally high-adrenaline movie, and Mark Mancina did well to add to that adrenaline rush. It's an excellent soundtrack and I enjoy it thoroughly each time I listen to it."
5,"Wonderfully composed music for ""Twister"" by Mark Mancina","Beautifully written, spirit-defining music which truly captures the awesome and deadly beauty of tornadoes and the over all mood. This music is definitely worth $16, but if you buy it here, it will be cheaper!"
5,Almost on par with Jurassic Park.,The CD itself has one or two songs missing from the movie. But the rest of them are here and accounted for. I enjoyed the movie so much I bought the score that should say how good it is. Following along with the movie you'll know what songs are matched with what scenes and they can be very dramatic or have just the right sound for that part.
3,A Surprising Riddim,"This is a surprising Riddim from the Selector "" Fire Links"". I really did not know that he was capable for such instrumentals. Also the popularity of this Riddim. It fools you because it is so simple. It does not have the usual big bass of regular riddims but is music to the feet. Like usual stellar performance from ""Kartel"" with ""Real Badman"", and ""Beenie Man"" must have liked this riddim because he did a good song on it as well. I think is is safe to say any Riddim from ""Fire links"" is going to be a unique one. He is the Hottest and most creative live selector in my opinion and he made the ""Chakka Chakka Riddim"" which is also a success. So I guess he is on ""Fire"""
4,Fool's Gold is a good treasure!,"FOOL'S GOLD by Julie Skerven is a good romance with a bit of suspense thrown in. Typical of the Harlequin style romances, this one is based in a mythical town in western Wyoming. The suspense is good, the romance tasty, and the setting of a modern day ranch on the verge of becoming a dude ranch is good. A nice read!"
3,Adequate but disappointing,"I love sopranos so of course I ordered this CD even though the singers are all b-team performers. I do believe that I listened to a different recording from the one described by the other reviewers. Each of the performers falls flat at least once while trying to reach for a note beyond her range. I felt myself cringe several times. Several of the arrangements are pathetic where the arranger tried accommodate three voices where at most one voice is appropriate. At times each soprano is holding fast to a note that clashes sadly with the other two notes. If you buy this, rerecord the play list. Skip the opening number which is the worst of the lot. DO NOT listen to Sempre Libera. You will weep for the wrong reasons. But by all means do enjoy the show tunes. This is where the ladies shine."
4,Summarizes her previous books,"This book was okay... mostly gave anecdotes of people consciously creating their realities. Somewhat of a rehash of her first 2 books. I have all 3 of her books, and the one I turn to regularly is ""Ten Thousand Whispers"""
5,A Glorious Book,"This book is the result of a cooperative effort by a number of noted experts in the field of naval history. It provides the latest known facts regarding tactical details, numerous pertinent photos and previously unpublished (to my knowledge) biographical info about many heros of the battle. Every student of the war in the Pacific needs this book."
5,Best book I've read about Midway.,"Simply fantastic. I've read many books about this topic but this is the best. No theatrics, just the facts presented in a very readable format. Great work."
1,Not a closed caption feature,"I'm very dissapointed with this feature because the information of the product describes with closed caption, and this is false. I can read much english, but a very little understand the pronunciation."
2,It is not a 3d movie at all,I bought it because i though it was a 3D movie and not at all. It was a dvd with some old 3d lens for see it in a bad 3d format. The movie it is a classical and is a beautiful movie a and wonderful story but the quality of this movie in particular is terrible. No I would not recommend it.
1,What I think,I did not care for this book. The choices the author made were somewhat limited. I would not recommend the book.
3,Punk...?,"Meh, punk certainly not, I do not agree...Its pretty good music, but no, its slower than most rock and appears to have some mix of country in it. it was a pretty good cd, but i would put it under a mix of country-rock"
4,A horrible tragedy.....written about in this book,"This book is very informative. If one knows very little about the background of the case, it gives good details. It also comes with good pictures. If you are like me and have logged onto her web site along with modbee.com and ktvu.com and scottpetersontrial.com and have already read every article, this book will be repetitive.I only got it because I wish I got to know Laci Peterson. It was my way of getting to know her, her family, and to see what she went through in her final days. This tragedy has touched me! The Rocha family is so down to earth and it's a shame that this even happened to Laci and Conner."
1,XAM FACS for Teachers?,This book is poorly written and loaded with typos. There are 3 typos in the dedication alone! The use of opinions throughout the text makes one wonder about the vaildity of the information. This cannot possibly be written for teachers taking a certification test! I do NOT recommend this book.
2,Disappointed,"The binto bar wasn't very sturdy or convenient to use.Never even made it to the woods.The Binto bags though, I love those and have several now.Much more versatile and not necessary to haul them or pack them in a larger case."
1,Not Worth The Money,"I've been taking this for over a month and I don't see any changes at all. I have to tell the suppiler that Ijust got the first shipment that was sent to the wrong address, that I just got to a week ago. It had beendropped off at the apt office and kept forgetting to let me know! So, if the suppiler wants to charge me for it,they may do so."
3,"Just ok, not very impressive","I thought the bale was too simple, could have been better, too light weight for the pendant, should have been better."
4,sharp,"I would have to qualify this review with ""for the money"". I paid a reasonable price for the piece that I received, and my wife seems very happy with it. High quality for the price range, and the wife was happy, a win. But, obviously from ""that"" price range."
5,Butterfly Pendant,My girlfriend will not take this off ;). Very nice sturdy quality with a decent chain. You will be happy with this item!
2,pendant not round,"I received this pendant today. The chain is nice and the lustre is decent, but there is one segment of the outer ring that is flat, not curved - so the circle looks like it has a big dent in it. This is so strange looking it is very distracting. Even though it was inexpensive, it looks so bad I think most people would rather receive nothing than this as a gift. I will be returning it."
4,Beautiful Necklace,The necklace is beautiful and shiny. It is a great gift for yourself or someone else. The only problem I had was that my hair kept getting caught in the chain when I wore it.
2,Looked cheap,"Okay, it was cheap, but it looked cheaper than I expected. Luckily, I don't really like the person I bought it for. It might be nice for a child or someone who likes odd butterfly designs a lot. The chain was short, but I'll take responsibility for being too lazy to get my tape measure out."
5,Beautiful Necklace,The necklace is lovely. It arrived soon after purchase in a handsome velvet case. Quite a bargain.
5,"Sterling Silver Butterfly Design Pendant, 18""",The service was prompt and the product was in great condition.Thanks!R. Caspers5 out of 5 stars...
5,large and beautiful,"I'm happy I got this necklace because I've gotten lots of compliments on it since the first day I wore it. The design is unusual, and this would make a great gift - I'm thinking of ordering another one for my mother because she loves silver jewelry. The chain is well-made and complements the pendant very nicely. All in all, a great piece of jewelry to give as a gift or add to your own collection!"
4,Butterfly pendant,I ordered this for my mom- she was wanting something to wear everyday. She loved it! I was impressed with the quality of the pendant and the chain. It arrived in a very nice gift box.
4,Great Swedish Thrash Metal,"Soilwork's new album 'Figure Number Five' was a major dissapointment, but where they failed, The Defaced shall shine. Theses Swedish metal masterminds (boasting members from Darkane and the aforementioned Soilwork) have crafted some brilliantly heavy thrash metal. With their catchy and heavy metal licks and Swedish roots, this band really stands out when listening to the record. By chosing not to follow the rest of the crowd and rehashing every Swedish metal cliche known to man, it makes 'Karma in Black' a solid metal release. The whole album gets more enjoyable with every listen, often digging up more death inspired roots in the tracks. Highlights include ""Once in Between', 'Exit Body on Mass', and 'The Fading Suns'. If Soilwork has gotten a bit stale for your taste and the likes of Omnium Gathering seem a tad too extreme, then satisfy your thirst for Swedish thrash with this great release from a great and promising band."
3,Not what I expected,"Maybe I need to listen to this album a few more times to appreciate this band. Being a fan of old Soilwork and Darkane, especially "" Chainheart Machine"" and "" Rusted Angel "", I thought this album would be more speed oriented. Unfortunately there are no fast songs on the entire album. I guess I will give it a few more listens before I come to a final conclusion. To be continued...If you want to hear some great death/thrash bands pick up new releases by The Forsaken and Dimension Zero."
2,Cheap,"This brand is rather cheap, however it isn't expensive so I shouldn't be surprised. The thing is taking the links apart, I dented them just taking them apart, so be careful! The laser engraving looks great, I do have to say."
5,Debitage basics,"This volume contains a set of essential articles by well known analysts in the field of lithic debitage analysis. These papers consider the strengths and weaknesses of the various common approaches (e.g. debitage size distribution, flake attributes, etc.) to lithic debitage analysis current in the field today. The volume is a very useful reference."
4,Wallace-Center of the Universe,"This little book was a pure delight. Danny Wallace is funny, sensitive and just such a pleasure to read. The city, Wallace, Idaho, is where my husband grew up, so it held a special interest for us. It's such a neat little town, and Danny's descriptions are right on. Hope Danny continues to visit Wallace, now and then."
2,Some strengths and weaknesses...,"Smokey still has the pipes, and this is an enjoyable listen. The arrangements are first-rate, a cut above some other attempts at this material. But his tempos are so slow, he reduces each song to a funereal pace. Smokey can still do it; too bad he can't do it faster!"
4,Timeless Smokey,"It's really a classic in and of itself. As for Smokey, he does do a fine job of adding his special touch to these timeless classics. You have to be a fan of the older classics to appreciate this masterpiece by one of the greatest voices of our time. Although I do not know much of the timeless classics that Smokey sings on the CD, the smooth richness of Smokey's voice makes me a fan. In short if you love Smokey that is all there is, then you'll love this CD as a true Smokey fan would."
2,Not what I expected,Smokey has one of the best voices around but he adds a lot of different things to these songs. If they were song like they should have been it would be a great CD. Unfortunately when Smokey tries to add his style for me the songs lose listening appeal.Smokey is still great but not the way he sung these songs.
3,Smokey is Timeless yet misplaced,"Smokey's voice is exquisitely, melodiously, beautiful, but I did not enjoy listening to him sing songs I associate with other artists especially Frank Sinatra. I now know I only enjoy Smokey singing his signature songs from my past, just like he did in the 2006 concert of his that I attended. Had I listened to any of the cuts before purchasing the CD, I would not have purchased it."
2,Not even a good attempt.,"When will artist realize you can't change the old classics. The only successfull R&B group to sing the classic ""Night and day"" to their own beat was the Temptations CD ""What women want"" the best rendition I have ever heard. Smokey does have the voice for these kinds of songs. Another good CD with classics is Willie Nelson's Stardust."
2,disappointment,"I was disappointed in this CD. The choice of songs is okay, but his voice leaves a little to be desired. Not something I would recommend to true Smokey Robinson/Miracles fans. Some of the songs are almost painful to listen to. I am sorry I wasted my money."
5,"Timeless Love, Smokey Robinson",Smokey is terrific all the time. This in particular is a great CD. I saw him on Jay Leno's show and he sang. He appears to be a good person as well. I would listen to all his music.
4,Not bad at all,It is a book that could be very helpful if you wanted to go over Spiritual Disciplines as a small group study and you need some leadership material.
3,A good starting point for the topic,"Culture Matters is a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the arguments relating cultural factors to development. The high quality of most of the authors and the variety of topics provides a solid exposure to the several angles of the issue.However, the book falls short of a) offering a structured and compelling argument for the relationship between cultural factors and development and b) offering enough evidence that it is not only relevant, but relevant enough to be in the mainstream debate.It seems to be a reflection of the stage of development of this ""school of thought"". One finishs the book with the feeling that this school has yet to accomplish two things a) reach a much stronger logical and factual explanation of the causal relations between a society's culture and its level of development; and b) show how much culture matter compared to other variables, such as geography, natural resources, educational system, etc."
2,Tedious academic compilation,"There were a few good nuggets of information in the varied chapters; however, most of the content of this book is hopelessly dry and academic. Seemingly written by professors and wonks for other professors and wonks, I cannot raise the appraisal of Culture Matters above two stars. Yes culture most certainly matters. The value sets of peoples around the world determine if they develop and thrive, or collapse into mediocrity."
4,very interesting read,"Culture has been long ignored amongst the debates for/against globalization and economic progress. I am glad that many experts are currently realizing the fact that culture Makes the society, not the other way around. You can only advance once you learn the rules of the game. Although some of the economic analysis bore me a little, some of the intriginng theories behind the fate of nations, especially the developing ones, cannot be missed by anyone who is interested in changing globalization for the better."
2,Worth a read -- find out what academics think!,"Well, we are very carefully approaching a point of actually *applying objective standards* to how well cultures allow their populations to self-actualize. As we shrink in horror from the idea, let's just have a peek inside this book.Lawrence Harrison has the requisite progressive pedigree to pull this off.A few interesting give-and-takes in the book.A few VERY OBVIOUS cultural issues left out.The book could have been much, much worse. For the most part, these folks kept their post-modernism under control and wrote in a comprehensible manner.Not entertaining, but not horrid."
3,Look at the perspectives,"I see that many whom support the arguments in Culture Matters - on this site and elsewhere - are generally non-Western, and simply hanker for the opportunity of a Western lifestyle. It seems that they are seduced by the comforts of democracy and the economic vernacular. It's not surprising!Westerners who have the option of 'choice' accuse Huntington et al of cultural imperialism and racism. Let the periphery-dwellers speak out - for the thesis that culture values progress is reasonably debated in this collection of essays.Don't get caught up in the romanticism of the 'other':""a society in which magic and witchcraft flourism today is a sick society ruled by tension, fear, and moral disorder"" (Daniel Etounga-Manguelle, Culture Matters, p73)."
2,outdated,Short and sweet:Read this if: 1) you want to understand the mindset that creates a foreign policy that makes other countries think the US is arrogant; 2) you can abstract from the ethnocentrism and think about the importance of institutions in the context of capitalism. Don't read this if: 1) you are likely to be bothered by the lack of attention to history -- this text ignores studies that tie the very progress and institutions they are discussing to colonial legacies; 2) you won't appreciate the overview of value systems around the world (which is very helpful) because it relies on homogenizing cultures.
3,A helpful guide for Domino Administrators,This book is a helpful guide for R5 administrators. Though by no means comprehensive it has been of value in managing my infrastructure and is certainly of greater value than manuals written by Lotus Development. It is best to use this book along with those written by Tamura (QUE) and Burke (SAMS). The Essential Reference by Bankes and Hatter is also useful. A recommended item for anyone managing an R5 environment.
5,"Everything you need, step by step","This has to be the definitive guide for R5 administrators. Everything is in there, and he describes what each topic is, then generates a steop by step on how to go about performing it. Its my bible for R5 admin."
2,cheap quality,The description says it can accommodate up to a 220lb dog. My dog is 87lbs and the flimsy lock and flimsy pastic already broke after less than 3 mos.
5,Nice and Sturdy,"Have had this dog carrier for 5 years now and still looks and functions great! I put two medium sized dogs in it. I also have the sheepskin padding on the bottom, along with the food and drink cups. Would buy again if needed."
5,Two thumbs up for Zen Man!,"This is an entertaining, suspenseful, and thought provoking film that is a liberating study in Zen. Between the beautiful cinematography, the intriguing storyline, and Han's skillful martial arts scenes emerge the lessons of honor, respect, revenge, and truth. Not since the TV series Kung Fu years ago with the Master and ""grasshopper"" has there been entertainment that delves beneath the surface to enrich the viewer through an exercise in enlightenment. Zen Man does this masterfully."
5,Impressive film,"Zen Man reminds me of a Billy Jack type film. Occasionally, I noticed that with more budget more could have been done in the chasing scenes but boy, it still is impressive for an independent film. This is a beautifully filmed movie, showing real fighting action. You don't really find that kind of movie too much anymore. I give it five stars."
3,ZEN MAN,"I LIKED THE MOVIE ZEN MAN. I ENJOYED THE PARTS ABOUT THE KOREAN VILLAGE, AND HIS FAMILY LIFE. I'D GIVE THE MOVIE 3 1/2 STARS. I HOPE HE MAKES MORE MOVIES ABOUT KOREA, AND THE HI STORY OF HIS VILLAGE, AND THE SEN MAN. I DON'T THINK THIS WAS AN EASY MOVIE TO MAKE. I THIINK HE COULD BE ANOTHER BILLY JACK."
5,MY KIDS LOVE IT,"The age for this product says two years or older, I gave it to my one year old on her b day. After she tried eating all the food thinking it was real she got the hang of it. Her five year old brother knows what to do with it making fake meals and feeding me breakfast. It only took about a week before my one year old started playing along.There is so much food and dishes that it was a hassle at first picking every thing up every day sometimes two or three times a day. But I fixed that by giving my five year old his first chore ever. I like a purchase that has a life to it and this is so sturdy I believe it will be around for my grand kids as well."
4,"The kid's love it, storage is poor.","Well, I just had to have this kitchen. And overall, it is fun and Step2 definitely makes good products. I've had this for over a year. My complaint is lack of storage. The storage areas (for foods and ""pots/pans/cups"") are extremely small. All of the cabinets (including the oven/microwave) combined wouldn't hold the amount of items that 1 small cabinet in one those wooden kitchen sets would hold. So overall it's nice and sturdy (both of my kids have climbed all over it - without permission mind you) and it's held up well. But if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't b/c it's so big without the storage (and we don't have a playroom)."
5,The most amazing kitchen!!!!,"My 5 year old really wanted this for his birthday. He has become a big fan of The Food Network, so his imagination has been kicked into high gear! He LOVES IT! My husband's grandmother bought it for him and we were surprised that our 13 month old daughter was so into it also! I put it together and I thought it was really easy. You will need an electric screwdriver/drill to really get it together. I thought it was a little pricey, but it's truly worth EVERY dime! My son probably won't be interested in it in a year or so, but my daughter will have YEARS of enjoyment out of it. She loves the sounds it makes and she pretends to eat everything! I do recommend buying another stool though. I really can't say one bad thing about this toy. It has been wonderful for my son's imagination and to watch him ""prepare"" foods is so cute. He really gets into it. Thank God for this and The Food Network!"
1,"Purchased Step 2 Cream LifeStyle Grand Walk-In Kitchen, received mis-match lower cabinets","I was so disappointed when the item I purchased on-line arrived the way it did. It matched only in layout to what was displayed online. If I wanted a mismatched ugly expensive product, I couln't have done a better job. Buyers Beware."
5,Great kitchen,"my daughter loves this ""walk-in"" kitchen, bigger than most but lots of realistic features. She even decorated it with some of her own touches! seems durable so far. Lots of cupboard space to store small items. super cute!"
5,Great!,"The Grand Walk-in Kitchen is great. Easy to assemble. My little one loves it. And, big enough and sturdy to last for a number of years"
5,unity,This is a great story to help children understand that God made each of us different and that we are better together.
1,HUGE RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The only thing on this dvd from Bugs Bunny is an old WWII bond drive advert. The rest of the dvd is taken up by ANCIENT unentertaining cartoons that look as if someone stole them out of a garbage tip!!!!!!!! Don't spend your money on this shameless rip off!!!
4,Comfortable Shoes,"I decided to review these shoes after wearing them for a few months. Since it is an all leather upper, they do not breathe very well. Also I have noticed the laces are slowly cutting in to the leather - as there are no metal eyelets for lacing the shoes up. Other than that, they have been very comfortable."
5,Triumph over Adversity,"This is the first book of this type I've ever read and I found the technical aspects very interesting and enlightening as I knew nothing about this industry. I enjoyed the suspense, the vivid mental pictures I got of the actual planes dropping the fire repellants and water on the flames. I think the main character is very human and his ability to overcome the tragedy of his family is very inspiring. I particularly liked the military personnel being given an opportunity to use the skills they developed in the service once they went back to civilian life. I did not find the technical aspects overwhelming, rather they intrigued me. I hope there will be another book using these same characters in the future."
4,Firebombers Incorporated,I enjoyed this book and found it very interesting and educational. Prior to having read this book I had no idea as to the science and techniques involved into fighting a brush or forest fire to bring it to 100% containment.Can't wait for book number two.
2,Great Series-But These DVDs SUCK!!!!,"To save the price of a plastic disc, these guys decided to burn these episodes, double sided, on three disks. The result is that they freeze up-usually at the climax of each episode. Fortunately, they learned their lesson on the subsequent seasons."
2,Poor Manufacturing Quality Control,"My wife bought this for me for Christmas because I am a huge Rockford/James Garner fan. I was so excited I opened it early. What do I find? The pilot is missing from the set; disc one is full of glitches in video and sound. I was unable to watch The Dark and Bloody Ground due to it freezing about 15 minutes into the episode each time. The first episode seemed to be okay except for minor glitches but still watchable. The problems with the second episode (see above) spoiled the whole experience for me though. Whoever Universal used for their DVD burning/production did a really poor job. I hope they feel they got their money's worth, I sure don't! For this amount of money, I expect more."
5,Worth the wait!,"Hey ... you'll never believe how much they cut out til you see an entire episode! Wow ... nice! If you like Jim Rockford, then you LOVE the DVD's!"
5,Rockford Files Season #1,One of the best T.V. shows ever! It's about time it came out. I can't wait for season 2!!!!
5,If only Marvel Comics did an adaptation of this,"Marvel Comics was known as ""The House of Ideas"" in the 1960s and 70s. When liscencing came out in the mid-70s with the adaptation of CONAN to comics, the door was open to titles and concepts other than just superheroes, sci-fi, horror or westerns. Detective comics were done OK, yet slowly came and went by the mid-80s. Being that Marvel had adapted BATTLESTAR GALACTICA for Universal Studios into comics form, why couldn't they have done the same for the detective shows of that time? Here is my top five shows that should have been adapted into comics by Marvel:1. The Rockford Files2. Kojak3. Columbo4. Baretta5. McCloudFor DC comics the same thing. Here is my list, in no particular order:1. Starsky & Hutch2. Charlie's Angels3. Mannix4. S.W.A.T.5. Hawaii Five-OI can only imagine what could have been. I guess we'll never know."
5,The Best,"I love the Rockford files, with Jame's Garner with his own stunts you can't go wrong.. we own all but season 6, and my brother and I are burning through these faster than Rockford can drive his good 'ol golden car. If you don't like where the punch and the sound are a little off, or how they made tv shows in the time they were in than this isn't your series. Not much to say other than this, as you'll have to be the judge of if you like it or not. I know I'll be sad once we get done with the last season."
4,Rockford is out in England and Canada!,All 6 seasons are now for sale on ebay for around $270.00.Soon they will be broken down into individual seasons.jpm
3,decent show looking back,Growing up I hated this show. My father dominated the TV set so when it came on I had to watch it. I hated it. I thought it looked dated and grungy back then too. Well I decided to watch it now after all of these years. And it was a decent show. Kinda funny. This review kinda sums up the entire series for me. I don't know if they did some filming tricks or what but that trailer sure did look nice on in the inside. I loved those plantation shutters. :-) The outside looked like a wreck. The one thing that this show taught me is . . . America is too big for its britches now . . . you will never see or hardly know a down on his luck man's man show like this again. But then again . . . he lived in a trailer with ocean front view in Santa Monica. LOL Look at that place now. Anyway it was a good trip back. Decent plots.
4,"The Rockford Files, Season 1","James Garner is one of my favorite actors; &, not only that, he's a very good actor, elevating whatever product he was in another notch. The Rockford Files is not an exception. Garner was chosen for this role because, essentially, it's a twentieth century update of Maverick. And since Maverick isn't available on DVD I console myself with this.Rockford was as human as any character would be on TV in that era. He wasn't a tough guy but he didn't back down when cornered, even if he was outnumbered. But, like most of us, he would try to talk his way out of something, after all, discretion is the better part of valor. No, he didn't always get the girl, but he always got the criminal, mostly due to his dogged determination.There are 23 episodes available here & these are complete. There are some bonus products to enhance your viewing pleasure. So, enjoy the best P.I. series of all time."
5,Almost in tears,"I am trying to anticipate what on earth is next to preceed Rockford Files on DVD. Alf? For crying out loud!I have worn out , or loaned out my VHS collection, and I don't know how much more I have left. All of the episodes now on TV are edited, and I am being kind, to make room for more commercials to pay for the syndication. Some of the best scenes are left on the cutting room floor. Even James Garner must see the fan base that is out here. If it is a monetary issue, I will be glad to help. Or I can assist in negotiations with the studio. I am making myself available. 24-7. Please cut the red tape, and give us Rockford on DVD, heck we will even pay for it. As Always, Electric Larry"
2,Freeze Turkey!,"I love this show, but disc #3 seems to have some serious quality control issues. The original copy, as well as a replacement generously offered by Amazon, both freeze in the exact same locations, for the exact same episodes.I wonder if one or more of the Universal DVD masters for disc #3 is flawed? If so, hopefully Universal will respond and correct this issue soon.Discs #1 and #2 seem to work perfectly.It might be sensible, for those trying to defend Universal, to investigate the mastering instead of simply assuming DVD player incompatibility. More than one customer has identified symptoms that suggest mastering problems.The show, itself, is superb--the best show of the 1970s, combining action, subtle comedy, and thoughtful themes and story lines."
3,Rockford Files--Season 1--Linda's View,"I am enjoying watching the episodes of this great series. However, I really have to agree with the general concensus of most people who complain about the two-sided disks. I really hate them. My Toshiba disk player could not get into two different episodes because the machine froze up on me. So that's two episodes that I could not watch. Universal really should put these out on better quality disks. Other than that, I really enjoy watchine this series on DVDs."
5,More than just a great PI show,"I recently bought the first season of the Rockford Files on DVD. I have to say, the show is even better than I remember it. Being able to sit there and watch one episode after another gives it a Zen-like quality. Maybe it's just comforting to see a decent guy like Rockford making his way through the world no matter what comes his way. He's always true to his convictions without being self-righteous. I've grown to respect the run-down trailer, the Firebird, and the way he wears the same sports coat over and over and over again. Some say the car chases are at times over-long or too frequent, and maybe they are right, but at the same time I have to say that the car chases on Rockford have a quality to them that you don't on other shows. I hope nobody ever decides to redo the show, because they could never do it justice."
4,Starting at the beginning,"The season one is good, but think I like the later years when the criminal buddy comes into play---forgot his name just now!! anyway this was a really good program and usually didn't miss"
5,great stuff,Fantastic series. Angel is the most!Too bad they used him on only two episodes in season one.
1,rockford files season#1,"i had to return this item twice, because parts of this or all of this twosided dvd would not play. the second time i requested a refund becausei didn't want to go thru the hazzel again. i'm wondering if i'm the onlyone having this problem! from this point on i will never purchase a twosided dvd, even though i've never had a problem before this."
5,Rockford Season One,"James Garner creates the most appealing detective character in Jim Rockford. His intelligence, warmth and humanity show from the very first episode. By the end ofseason one the high level of writing, direction and talented guest stars makes thisthe crime drama that sets a stardard that others have tried to immitate."
3,"excellent content, terrible two sided DVDs","Excellent series.Horrible two sided DVDs. I returned DVDs to Universal at my expense with all the paper work. The ones I got back were just as bad as the original ones.Fortunately, the rest of the seasons come in the one sided format."
4,"Liked the episodes, not-so-good quality disks","These James Garner ""retro"" detective episodes were fun to see again. Loved to see the vintage cars. The quality of the CD's leave much to be desired. Even though the CD's had very few scratches, the disks skipped often, some more than others, which affected the enjoyment of the viewing. Too bad."
1,5 stars for the show and 1/2 star for the DVDs!,"Various episodes on these disks are freezing up!I think other reviewers here are reporting the same thing in varying degrees.There is no excuse for a major studio like Universal to put out the poor digital quality DVDs they seem to do so frequently and to skimp on the DVD ""extras"".I also had a freeze-up ""bug"" with one episode in my McMillan & Wife collection (also a Universal release); this kind of thing really spoils one's enjoyment!As far as The Rockford Files ""the series"" goes, it was and is a first-class show. I watched it back in the 70s when I was a kid. Garner and Rockford rule!5 stars for the show and 1/2 star for the DVDs themselves."
1,Great series BUT DON'T BUY UNIVERSAL/MCA DVDs,We were thrilled to get the Rockford Files for Christmas. We sat down to watch and about half way though the first episode when the skipping started. The DVD ultimately froze and we were not able to finish the episode. Unfortunately we had seen this before with our Leave it to Beaver DVDs. Guess what they have in common. They are made by Universal Studios Home Entertainment(also call Mca Home Video). I did some research and found that this is a common problem with their DVDs. The quality is just crap. I have lots of DVDs and these are the only ones I have a problem with. I am reporting them to the BBB. (...)
2,"The Great, the Rotten and the Ugly","What's ugly is the box and all the menus. (Clearly, the designers at Universal decided to only use menu photos where Garner looks 75-years-old.)What's great is obvious: the show itself. Man, does this ride get better every year. (Probably the only thing from the 1970s that one can say that of.) It is just so human, funny, and stylish. And the great thing about the set are the completeness and visual/audio quality of the eps. Don't be fooled -- this is the best the episodes have ever looked and sounded.What's rotten is everything else. No extras. Cheap disks. No pilot. If you have access to a NTSC/PAL DVD player, I highly recommend picking up the British release which does have some extras and does include the Pilot.Let's pray that Season Two gets a better treatment than did Season One."
5,Long live the Rockford Files,"I give Jimmy Rockford 5 stars anytime.. Another fantastic creation.. Great stories, actors and special guests. If you like PI series tv, here it is.. I only have the first two seasons, as there have been numerous releases of other shows in the same era, and i'm trying to pick which ones to get first.. The complete Rockford Files series is for sure going to be in my collection soon. Time to tell the networks we have had enough of reality tv.. bring back shows like this one.. What happen to the days of actually looking forward to Prime time tv? Buy the Rockford Files. Excellent series and kid-friendly.."
2,"Great show, bad discs","This is one of my favorite shows from the 70's, and having never seen the first season I was really excited to get it on DVD. The problem is that the quality of the discs is terrible.Sound and video are good, but several episodes on disc one would freeze up. Disc 2 only had a few episodes that would play all the way through. Disc 3 is fine. Checking on other DVD players, I had the same freezes in the same places. Clearly a problem with the discs.I'm not able to return the set since it was a gift, but even if I could, given the reviews here I doubt I'd get a set where all episodes would play. Maybe if you buy several sets you can end up with playable versions of all the episodes. Buyer beware."
3,"OK TV show, but gets old fast","When you first watch the show it's kind of interesting, has action coupled with reasonable characters and story lines, however the show becomes quite monotonous after the first season or two, with Rockford's character morphing into an absurd overly arrogant know-it-all ladies man, and the story lines becoming quite predictable. That said, it is interesting to see the street shots of LA in the ""old days""!"
4,great show but extras are lacking,"4 stars given because the bonus items of ""the making of the Rockford Files"" (maybe 10 minutes tops) left you wanting for more information. Also, I do not think that they included the orginal pilot episode. Never-the-less, I enjoyed this series when it orginally ran and I still enjoy it now. Can't wait to get the other seasons!"
5,Wonderful insights into Asian cultures,Wonderful tales about Asia -- a peek into other cultures. I especially appreciate the insights into women's lives and their roles throughout the history of China and Japan. So different than the West. Reading about Asia and travel to these parts of the world are the only bridges we have between the West and the East.Carol[...]
2,the inventor never tried his own toy,"wonderful idea but its just impossible to pass more than the second hold.the ball move so fast so you never have control over it, at the end it's only luck.i will try to find a boll that bring more control of movement and lets see."
5,PeenPoo,"Though it's kind of a gag gift, the baby I bought this for absolutely loved these dolls. They're cute and very soft, and washable. I think that it would be a good thing for Americans not to be so backwards about elimination. From a child, we treat it like it's a dirty naughty thing, when colon health should be on everyone's mind."
1,Can't believe I spent $20 on this,"I was looking for something for my [..]son. Based on the two reviews, this seemed good. This was awful... I mean awful. Totally amateur. If they suckered 100 people to open the video so that it is unreturnable, they've earned back the production costs and then some. [..]down the drain. Utterly disappointing."
2,My mistake,"Some of Vangelis music is beautiful, but not all. Only liked one song on here. This was my mistake, should have just bought the one song."
4,Oceanic or Titanic ?,"This should have been the soundtrack to James Cameron's TITANIC ! It's a shame Vangelis was not chosen to do the score or soundtrack. Despite the fact that he used sampled ocean sound effects, the music alone has a very convincing overall presence that you are actually at or in the ocean with a gorgeous panoramic beach or coastline nearby. For anyone who's a Vangelis fan, this album should not be missing from their collection."
4,Vangelis-Oceanic,Put on Vangelis' Oceanic and let the melodic and soft music take you on a journey to the blue oceans of the world. Swim down to its depth and coralls and let the waves move your self in to balance and peace without ever moving out of your chair. Wake up to your everyday life as a better and more harmonized human being.
5,Genuine aquatic music to escape with,"If you want to relax on a hot summer day this work will put you in a cooler, mellower world. As the CD jacket may indicate, it sort of reminded me of escapist music from friendlier times; sort of a modern day 30's aquatic musical soundtrack. It is not quite so refreshing on a cold sloppy winter day, but still mood setting. If you want to really chill this will get you there."
4,The CD that made me like Vangelis,"After hearing my brother's copy of the BLADE RUNNER soundtrack, I said, who's that artist? And went out and bought OCEANIC, Vangelis' most recent album. I was impressed by his ability to master a wide field of feelings and emotions. While not as melodic as some other albums, it'll entrance you, the only way to feel closer to being on the ocean floor is to actually go there. The guitar in ""Spanish Harbor"" is just awesome."
5,Oceanic; Fathoms of Textural Nautica,"I am a big fan of the ""master"" of the one man electronic symphony. I have most every recording he has ever released, and patiently await his next. I was not swept off my feet at first listen to Oceanic as I have been in the past by releases like Direct and The City. This one crept up on me and delivered an incredibly addicting affect. Although subtle, the CD (when given fair play time) enraptured me with deep ethereal complexity and power. I can feel the heat of the sun and the crash of the waves whenever I listen to this CD. Like no one else I've discovered, Vangelis's music creates for me emotion in visually textural climates. Oceanic is just another of many of his musically magical worlds I love to explore. Close your eyes and give this one a try!"
3,"5 stars plus for ""Memories of Blue"", 2.5 stars for the rest","I listen to this album for Memories of Blue, which is a superb example of what Vangelis does best. It's a contemplative, well orchestrated (which means not *too much* orchestration) piano piece which is adult in tone without being too melancholy or too difficult to get into. For me, it's sublime.And the rest of this album is pretty bland, disappointing, department store music. As someone else said, anyone could have written this. It sounds like Vangelis discovered a sampler and forgot to do anything other than sample. Or, in the case of Sirens Whispering, it just sounds painfully, embarrassingly godawful. Song of the Seas is almost good enough, but not quite."
3,disappointing,I love Vangelis but this is in my opinion the least interesting album he has ever produced;unlike his other works the music lacks soul and emotion.Too close to Muzak.I was rather disappointed.
4,Pretty melodies all around,"Oceanic is a delightful return to the better music of Vangelis. He provides his fans with an album that aims to please. Although most of his melodies are simple, he is able to obtain a harmonious equilibrium of sweeping themes and delicate instruments. I reccomend it, for Vangelis fans and new age fans who are interested in romantic, soft music."
3,Disappointing follow-up to 'Voices',There is something lacking on this recording. None of the music lacks taste as such; indeed there are some wonderful moments that truly uplift you. But the imagination and grandeur of 'Voices' just simply isn't here. All to often the music simply ambles along in a (dare I say it?) bland fashion. Not one of my favourites - and I have listened to just about everything Vangelis has released.
5,excellent reference book,we brought this with us thru london and scotland. i used it to make bed and breakfast reservations before we left and it was most accurate. this is an excellent reference book to have and one which all otherd are gaged against. very recommended.
5,Dated technology but a current lesson,"Though the Boeing 777 has been in serivce for several years, the lessons from its development that focus on organizational effectiveness are highly applicable to today's team based situations. This story is another example of the timelessness of sound experiences. This series of episodes is well worth investing the time to experience."
4,Awesome viewing,"This story follows the design and building, right through to delivery, of the new 777 plane from Boeing. Just the thought of the logistics of what it takes to achieve this feat is monumental. the documentary goes one step further; you become ""familiar"" with some of the key personnel involved.The shear scale of the parts, factories, number of people, travel, etc make for many points tto pondeer. I originally saw most of this on PBS and wish they had included the later 6th part with a different tione and commentary but the 5 parts do nicely."
2,Disappointing,"Maybe I've been spoiled by another brand of organic cajun spice that I had been using, or the fact I lived in Baton Rouge for many years and know what cajun food tastes like, but Morton & Bassett cajun blend doesn't do a thing for me.Since I purchased the 3 pack, I'll try using it as a base and add spices until there's an actual cajun zing to it. OR maybe I won't..."
5,Awesome Book,"Honestly I have no idea how this man survived. When you think you are having a bad day, pick this book up and read it. It saddens me to think how our POW's were treated. But this man Mr. Plumb has faith that he will be okay and it is his faith that gives him strength to pull through."
4,Good book..,"This is a good book that will help you do well on the Neuro Shelf/Mini-Board exam for 3rd or 4th year rotations. It is also helpful for Step II, with strong sections on stroke, epilepsy, autoimmune disorders, and headache. It's not something to be read in one day, but it can be done by the time the rotation ends. With this info in hand, you should do well."
4,Excellent basic text but...,"This remains an excellent textbook on neuroradiology. I think it should still be an essential read for a neuroradiology fellow. It is probably a little too much for a resident to ""read through"" during his/her neurorad rotations. The pictures are of high quality. But, the text book has one big drawback in that it is becoming more and more outdated. There is no significant mention of Diffusion/perfusion/PET imaging. I found this book to be a valuable read to gain knowlegde of the basics of neuroradiology. It bridges the gap between less detailed books such as the Mosby Handbook Series (also by A. Osborn) and a more complete reference text like Atlas' MRI of the Brain and Spine. This is still an excellent book to have."
3,Needing Tungsten T Hard case w/o holes,"I just placed an order for this case. Everyone that I know with a rhinoskin aluminum case has enjoyed them. The main complaint is that KNOWONE offers one without holes for the Tungsten T. Like I need to turn it on or get the stylus out with the lid closed. What is the point? I thought the main idea was to protect your $500 investment, not collect lint in the PDA where lint is not wanted. Rhinoskin, the next time you create a series of cases, create one option like your old clamshell designs. No holes! Palm, next time you release a new PDA, I am waiting on the accessory companies to ramp up their offerings. I don't think I would have bought the Tungsten T without a clamshell case that can FULLY protect the PDA. Other than that, great job from both companies."
2,RhinoSkin Alum. Hard Case,"Bad purchase for the price. Since about the third month I had this case the metal pin holding the ""face door"" on, continuously slips out and I have to fish it out of my briefcase and jam it back in. Got sick of doing that over and over and will now buy a simple Palm case."
1,Attention Tungsten T3 users,"I bought this item based on the first review since I own a Tungsten T3 and many items that are also compatible with T3 don't state so.Ok, I just got the case and guess what? It doesn't fit!!!The T3 is actually taller than the case, and though the case can actually close with the palm inside, the upper part of Tungsten T3 keeps exposed.So, don't do the same mistake I did. It's not compatible with T3."
4,Good choice takes a beating.,I purchased a Rhino Skin for my T3 It is probobly one of the best things I have done . The case functions easly and clips to your belt securly. The only problem is you can't use the cradle with it on or i would give it 5 stars.
3,"Not his best work, Uneven","KIlickenborg is a great nature writer but this book about rust belt Buffalo has moments of greatness, but other chapters of tedium. His writing flourishes can be intimidating. Have your dictionary ready. If you grew up in the east side of (Polish) Buffalo you will love the hundreds and hundreds of place references throughout W NY That alone will endear you. The story of a tavern owner and his extended Polish family is typical. (I heard that its really his inlaws) Its uneven but probalby the best book ever written about Buffalo, NY"
3,Very hard to hold my interest.,I found this book to be very hard to get into and very hard to hold my interst. As a former Buffaloian I thought I would be engrossed but I was not. Sorry
4,A GREAT BOOK FOR FANS OF THE SHOW,"THIS BOOK HAS A LOT OF INFO AND IS WELL WORTH READING. ADAM WEST TELLS SOME INTERESTING, UNIQUE AND HUMOROUS STORIES OF HIS LIFE, CAREER, AND TIME HE WAS ON THE SHOW. I FOUND HIS WRITING VERY WITTY, HUMOROUS AND WELL DONE. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. THE ONLY NEGATIVE I HAVE IS THAT I HOPED IT WAS LONGER AND MORE DETAILED. ALSO THE PHOTOS ARE GRAINY AND OUT OF FOCUS. BUT FOR A TRIVIA AND NOSTALGIC TV WATCHER THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO HAVE.VERY RECOMMENDED."
1,Doesn't Work!,"Sorry, it just doesn't work! It's well made, befitting the respepected name of Boxwave, but doesn't function well on actually capacitive touch screen. It will open an app, but it won't swype to the next screen without opening the first app it touches. It also won't draw well in a drawing app. It also fails to make a continuous path, as in the word game Word Up. I've purchased three current brands of styli and none of them work!"
4,Works like a charm,"This little pen is great for using on ipads or tap pads on cell phones. Makes a nice little stocking stuffer for the hard to buy for. I bought myself one also, as I have fat fingers and this helps me text message."
5,A+++ Reference Book...and fun to read!,"I've used the Samuelian book countless times as a reference when purchasing lamps for my business. All lamps are easily located by company name, or subject of the lamp. Prices are accurate, information is A+++, care and repair section is outstanding, and the photos make for quick and easy identification. I recommend this book to my customers and I can to you as well."
1,"Cute book, not very informative","While I enjoyed the idea of a book dedicated solely to motion lamps, of which I am an avid collector, I found the book to be somewhat childish in content. I didn't learn anything I didn't know about the lamps already. If you want to look at some pictures, and like to buy every possible book about antiques you can get your hands on, then the book may be a good purchase for you.If not, look elsewhere."
2,Too many inaccuracies,I found too many questions with incorrect answers. I found this book to be frustrating. A book of this type should be carefully proofread and it obviously was not.
4,I want to marry a mermaid. But not a gangster mermaid.,"Nagasumi is saved from drowning by a mermaid named Sun. Mermaid's are put to death if a human discovers their true form. In order to save Sun he decides to marry into her family. Her family is Yakuza. Sun goes to live with Nagasumi and his family, unfortunately her father and his lackeys tag along to keep an eye on her. This anime is a lot of fun. There are lots of school hijinks, love rivals and sticky situations. There is a lot to like about this story. Lots of random wackiness and tender loving moments. There are a lot of cliches but the story is still different enough to be quite enjoyable. All of the characters are really likable, and the laughs never stop. I recommend My Bride is a Mermaid to anyone who liked Tenchi Muyo or Love Hina. I want to marry a meramaid too, but not one that's a gangster."
5,MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE'S BOOK COLLECTION!!!!!,"From pet-lovers to fashion-lovers to anyone who loves a good laugh, Sweetie charms them all. Her voice is brought to life by Mark Welsh's wonderfully witty and insightful writing, while Rubin Toledo's drawings sing with color and pizzazz!I read the book with my daughter first, and then had to keep picking it up in the evenings for more. (When do we get to see ""Sweetie...The Movie?!"")Sweetie is a truly engaging character. I, for one, will be buying a copy for everyone on my gift list this holiday!"
5,"""And this little masochist is lifting up her dress...""","Hey Jupiter EP is a great and haunting collection live songs. First of all, the cd single, Hey Jupiter is re-recorded in the studio and has more of an edge to it, I love this remix version, Tori's voice sounds like an angel at the end of the track. There 4 live songs including Sugar, Honey, Professional Widow, and Somewhere Over the Rainbow. This is a great find and I am glad I bought it many years ago. This is a keeper!"
4,Worth it for the remix,"The remix of Hey Jupiter that is featured on this EP is definently worth the price of the CD in and of itself. I think it's an amazing and moving version of the song, and I prefer it over the album version. As for the other tracks, I don't care for the Professional Widow live track, but it's an interesting and sort of creepy experience. ""Sugar"" is a good Tori track, also worth owning - and she talks in the beginning, which I always like. :) I think any Tori fan should definently own this CD, if only for the mix of ""Hey Jupiter""."
5,This single is amazing,"Personally, I feel that the top reason for buying this CD should be for the B sides it contains. Tori's organ version of ""Professional Widow"" is truly genius."
5,Great CD,"""Hey Jupiter"" was one of my favourite songs on Pele and this Dakota version actually surpasses it, because of the new background music and the new verse added, which I think makes the song: ""I go from day to day / I know where the cupboards are / I know where the car is parked / I know he isn't you"". The rest of the CD is live and very enjoyable to listen to, especially the song ""Sugar"", and the way she chats with fans is very nice because Tori has a great sense of humour. Highly recommended."
5,Wicked Awesome!,"Tori is absolutely amazing live. If the live stuff of To Venus and Back isn't really you're kinda tori and you prefer the more accoustic tori, then this CD is for you. Sugar, Somewhere over the rainbow, honey, and professional widow are are really good and since tori put an organ twist on professional widow it has this really haunting melody to it. and i love the remix of hey jupiter alot. It's really really beautiful."
3,good then fleeting,"hey jupiter was the only good song on the disc...the rest were interesting at best. The merry widow version of ""professional widow"" was.... well it was something....not a close match between it and the studio version....if you are a die hard tori fan you will respect the album anyway its live....dont turn it up to loud!"
5,Hands down best EP,"This is the most incredible recording I've heard. I've seen Tori in concert six times and this seems like a culmination of the best she has to offer. I elevate this over the status of the Winter ep, which should say something in itself. Anyone who is a die hard Tori fan should buy this because it is simply amazing. The version of Hey Jupiter is to die for."
5,the ultimate. really.,"it's hard to find words to describe what this single means to me. it really is A WHOLE WORLD, a universe. it's all in there: tori-the-girl-with-her-piano (""sugar"" and ""rainbow""), the boys-for-pele-style (organ on ""widow""), the ""band"" (guitar on ""honey"") and even a little taste of ""to venus and back"" (""the dakota version"" of ""hey jupiter""). i think this cd would be very good for ""tori-beginners"" (me myself started with ""under the pink""), cause it's pure tori. nothing else. not like the remixes on other singles.... ""hey jupiter - dakota version"" is SO SO WONDERFUL.... the beginning reminds me a little bit of wolfsheim, a german gothic band. it's the dark side of tori. and i simply love this site of her."
2,Faux Like a Pro,I enjoyed this book but found that it repeated information I could find online at sites like Faux Like a Pro - www.fauxlikeapro.com
2,Creative Evolution,I found this book to be very simple but have found more practical techniques shown on Creative Evolution's website www.creativeevolution.net
3,"Nice mirrors inside, but crystals--Swarovski??",This mirrors are large and clear. The compact itself is a little cheap looking and mine was missing crystals. Seller replaced without a problem.
3,Onstream Backup,"The drive is good, but if it breaks you are in trouble because Onstream is now OUT OF BUSINESS. That means NO RMA so take good care of it. Needs cleaning tapes, says once a month but after 2 months its once a week or you get errors."
1,Read Ovid instead.,"This book is self-indulgent tripe ... there's a fine line between the wonderful tradition of rewriting and reinterpreting previously-told stories (see Ann Carson's Autobiography of Red for an absolutely glittering example) and just retelling. In this case, the story of Cineras and Myrra is taken from Ovid's Metamorphoses and spun out in excruciating detail. The difference between Ovid (and for that matter Carson) and Bidart is that the former poets use interesting language, whereas Bidart's is boring and self-aggrandizing."
3,"good, but considering Doonesbury's rep for excellence...","Buck Wild Doonesbury has some excellent strips in it but the book as a whole is lacking. WAY to much time is spent on Zonker's nephew Zipper. Zipper would be funny in short bursts but a huge amount is dedicated to him. Mike's internet company is losing millions and positions itself to go public...but...you'll just have to wait untill next fall to read about them doing so. At least Duke is in good shape through this book, trying to sell his house (still an orphanage) to a John Denver fan for millions and later becoming appointees for Jesse Ventura. Of course, Duke is always funny. It's also nice to see Roland Hedley make some hilarious appearances but overall this collection does not live up to the extreme standards GTB has set for himself and just makes me more eager for next fall's collection."
4,Wasn't the best but was still pretty good,I think this had many good strips but was missing to much. It didn't seem like it came after planet doonesbury. I really like the character zipper and if you do i suggest you read this book definetly. I think alex mikes daughter was also very funny as she sets up alex cam. I dont think this is even close to trudeau s other doonesbury books but if you reallly like doonesbury I suggest you get it.
4,do not get this first!,"I'm a big Exploited fan and I have all 8 studio recordings and a singles collection by Spitfire. However getting this second (I got the Single collection by spitfire records first)was kind of a big mistake. some of the songs are kind of boring and like the other albums where Wattie's voice keeps changing, it changed and not only that, sometimes you can't understand what the hell he's saying. If you get this album, highly recommended to get lyrics off the internet. on the lighter side there are a few good songs on this album and I really like the art for the front cover."
5,Best songs,"Earth, Wind & Fire are my favorite group to listen to. I love some of their songs and play them over and over."
3,Far too chatty!,"I'm currently reading this book and find it more than tedious to read through the author's chatty filler. If I wanted to read a cute ""Dummy"" book, I would have bought it instead.It's a major deficiency, as the comments are not funny and add both noise and unwanted content to an otherwise important book.Robert Kennedy"
4,The former singer from the Dentists is in this band,"I just picked this up the other day, and liked what I heard, having absolutely no idea who the band was. One thing was for certain, and it hit me immediately: I like the singer's voice, and boy, he sure sounds like the singer from the Dentists. And lo and behold, I just found out... he is! So, if you like the clips here, do yourself a favor and considering buying this."
4,A Very Good One!,"An extremely good progressive metal album! The song 'Child Of The Damned' has been played in HAMMERFALL's first album. After the band has splited the drumer has moved to ""Fate's Warning"""
2,slow-moving plot,"The plot in this book is very, very slow moving - it takes many pages for something exciting to happen. I think stones sink into the earth faster! While I appreciate the descriptive narrative, the book is just plain 'boring.'"
2,HO Engine,"At present I am waiting on the return of this product from Bachmann Trains in Philadelphia. That could be four to six weeks out according to the person I spoke with at Bachmann's customer service department. I strongly urge anyone reading this not to buy anthing from the merchant mentioned in my critique here. I had to send it back fresh out of the box because it would not run and the (bleeps) who sold it to me at Boca Raton Hobbies refused to do there part and replace it or give me a refund. So my appraisal is perhaps premature at this stage. It should probably be a five star item when running, as mine was not. So let that be understood. It should have great educational value if it operates as most Bachmann units do."
2,Not much pertinent information for a new collector.,"The pictures are exquisite, but as a new collector, I was somewhat lost. I guess the idea is to buy all 5 books. I really don't like the question and answer format. So much of the information there and elsewhere is irrelevant."
4,Almost Perfect,"First, if you shoot a SLR Digital and want a quick turn around for a proof, this is your printer (especially in the field).The only calibration/setting that I have needed to do is in the Brightness and Red. It only took three prints total to get the color balance right. It appears to work with all other pictures without readjustmentA big plus: it does a great job of printing Black & White. I have only one picture that might have a slight sepia tint. That is a very big plus for me. I shoot mostly B&W;, with the portability and product; it has helped with many of my film shots.Two reasons why I did not give it five stars; first, a matte paper would be nice, second, in the preview/adjustment screen it would be nice to see the adjustment of colors to the picture you want to print (not a generic smiling child).It is worth the cost for these reasons: portability, exceptional quality, ease of use, it is multi-voltage (110-240v) and more importantly, the compatibility with XP."
3,am i not getting something here?,"I received this printer as a gift, and was very pleased initially.... once i figured the cost per print, i wasn't sure if the convenience outweighed the cost... if you buy the 36 pack of paper and ink (you need to buy these, you can't use just regular photo printer paper) it works out to about 42 cents per... if you send your images to an online processor, it is anywhere from 22 to 29 cents per, and you have a guarantee that if it doesn't come out they will at least reprint it or refund your money. We were able to print out images on Christmas (nice feature, spontaneous and portable) but 2 of the 20 images printed out with a fuzzy on the photograph (which reprinted fine, but we paid for it basically).the image quality is good, but the convenience factor is really what you are paying for, stock up on bulk packs and it may work out financially...it is an excellent product, but there are limitations;costsizequality (fuzzies)other than that, it is a great product"
1,Design flaw that leads to defective printer,"There is a little plastic piece in the inside of this printer that breaks after a while (probably after your warranty runs out). This is a manufacturing defect. It results in the camera printing only the top or bottom half of the photos. After looking around online for a way to fix it, I have found that this has happened to several others, not just me. Some have been able to repair it (with glue), but I have not. For this reason, I would highly recommend that you don't buy this printer."
2,Paper Doesn't Fit Printer!!!,"Canon suggests you buy 4x6 Paper to fit the printer. They don't give you a cartridge to use the paper with. They give you a postcard size and a Wide Size. They also only give you a ink cartridge to print 5 pictures worth. You would think with a printer that costs this much they could give you a proper cartridge, suggest the right paper to use and give you an actual ink cartridge that lasts at least 24 pictures!!"
4,can the core of cities revitalise?,"The authors describe the trends in the 20th century that at first favoured the city, and then, after World War 2, favoured the surrounding suburbs. In the US, this led in some regions to a decayed inner city, abut against a prosperous business district, while the suburbs boomed.The book has a strong statistical bent. Numerous tables that document such things as relative per capita income of suburbs. These are used to buttress observations in the text. Plus, the book also speculates on future trends. Like perhaps a re-favouring of the inner city urban regions? Or of old suburbs. In part motivated by a relative cheapness of housing in those areas, compared to well-to-do suburbs that might have priced themselves out of affordability for much of the workforce."
4,PLANNING,"Haven't read it yet, part of a required planning course. Looks uptodate and very interesting."
4,As good as all their others.,"I have always liked ""Collective Soul"" since their first single came out, but for some reason I never gave this third album a listen. My mistake. What a great record. I find it to be just as good as anything else they've done, so if you like anything from the debut to ""Blender"", you should like this. It starts with the two excellent songs ""Precious Declaration"" and ""Listen"", picks up again with the title cut and ""Forgiveness"", and continues to impress with ""Link"", ""Giving"", and ""Everything"". Overall a must for fans, and anyone who likes pop, rock, or grunge should enjoy it. I hear they're working on album #6, let's hope it's this good."
3,More of the Same from Ed & the Gang,"Supposedly Ed Roland & the rest of the band barricaded themselves into a small cabin to concentrate on recording this album, their follow up to COLLECTIVE SOUL. Frankly, I'm not sure why they bothered. This album picks up where COLLECTIVE SOUL left off, and doesn't seem to go anywhere new. There's nothing bad about this album, just nothing inherently exciting or interesting about it. ""Precious Declaration"" is a pretty good song, but it sounds a fair amount like ""Smashing Young Man"". ""Listen"" and ""Blame"" are good, too, but also rather familiar. And it may as well have been recorded in a professional studio - it sounds the same. Not bad, but horribly interesting."
4,Very good composite work from Collective Soul,"This album is one of those that is listened to best as a whole. This one certainly isn't as hard as their self-titled, although those songs exist (""Precious Declaration"", ""Disciplined Breakdown"", ""Crowded Head""). However, the songs are well written, and are also, for the most part, relaxing. This is a solid album that is worth your while to buy."
5,Gotta get it.,"Not there best, but still great. If you like the music style, then you'll love it. They aren't major hard-core, but they don't have to be to put out a great piece of music. I listen to Korn, Nirvana, and Beethoven, but Collective Soul is still my favorite."
4,awesome CD. perfect from the first cut to the last.,This disc hasnt come out of my car disc changer in well over a year. You can't go wrong buying this collection.
4,Greta Music,"Princ is great artist and muscians.This movie packs humor ,dancing,sweet music and a icon in todays music industry.Loved all of Princes mucis."
1,Shiloh Owner,"This is a 5 star book!!!I own 2 Shiloh shepherds and they are wonderful dogs. The dogs are every thing promised and so much more. The temperment is wonderful, trainability is so easy the dogs seem psychic, and the work ethic exciting. No health problems at all.The few excerpts from the book certainly are tantilizing. I can't wait to read the whole thing and learn more about my dogs and the founder.If the written word is anything like ""Ma"" this will be a true page turner."
5,The Ultimate authority on Shiloh Shepherds,"If you owned or knew one of the old time German Shepherds of the 1960's this is the book that will reintroduce you to these wonderful dogs of yesterday. Excellent history of the development of this breed. Do not be confused by others that call their dogs Shiloh Shepherds, make sure you are dealing with the original breed founder!Excellent and very informative. Loved It!"
2,A mis-labeled track?,"I was looking forward to Track 4, ""Abergavenny"" by Shannon. Instead, this CD appears to contain the version by Marty Wilde! A lovely version, but not the one advertised on the label and on the Amazon product listing.There seem to be two versions of the cover art, also adding to the confusion."
3,Confusion Shannon,"Shannon IS Marty Wilde. In Britan and Australia ""Abergavenny"" was labeled as Marty Wilde, however, the same song was released by Wilde in the USA under the pseudonym Shannon - Not to be confused with the Shannon that had the Billboard 1984 hit ""Let The Music Play"". This was a female artist, real name Brenda Shannon Greene.Marty Wilde, real name Reginald Smith, used the Shannon pseudonym in August 1969 in the USA for the release of ""Abergavenny"".Hope this clear up any confusion.Cheers."
3,"Disappointed, only slightly helpful","I thought this would be a great product after reading all the reviews, but I am disappointed. The pillow is designed well but it isn't thick enough, I always have to prop the side I am nursing on or slouch to make this work. Yes, it does help improve your posture a little bit but I expected it to allow me to completely sit upright. Also, I didn't find putting this pillow on and snapping in place every single time my baby was hungry very practical. It is a bit cumbersome to put on (esp. when your baby is crying and is impatient!)I have found this useful however to prop my baby up to feed him and trim his fingernails at the same time. The only time he is relaxed enough for me to take care of his nails is when he is eating, and the pillow makes it much easier to get the job done. The storage pocket is useful for keeping my nail clippers and emery boards."
3,Not as good as a Boppy,"I purchased this in addition to the Boppy Pillow. It is nice for certain sitting environments but is not as versatile as the boppy. The surface area is very flat and doesn't really raise the baby high enough for nursing. I find I have to prop up the side he is nursing on to make it work. I like that it straps on as it stays in place. Overall, I use it but I prefer the Boppy."
1,Tough Guys,"Hi: I twice ordered the film ""Tough Guise"" not ""Tough Guys"" and on both occasions I was sent the latter. I am not impressed."
5,Excellent Bio Of This Overlooked Confederate Guerilla,"Captain John J. Dickison, 2nd Florida Cavalry, CSA, was Florida's equivalent during the Civil War to Virginia's celebrated partisian John Mosby, or to Kentucky's John Hunt Morgan. It was Dickison and his small band of horsemen who almost single-handedly kept Florida's interior from falling under Union control. Using the states natural terrain for cover and employing modern guerilla tactics, he inspired such fear and respect in his northern enemies that Federal forces rarely ventured west of the St. Johns River in central and north Florida. This land became known as ""Dixie-land"", a play on his last name, and he became known to all as the ""Swamp Fox"". Using numerous published and unpublished primary sources, Mr. Koblas has written the first-ever thorough military biography of this legendary and overlooked Confederate."
1,Terrible,"What a terrible and un-objective book!If anyone here is actually interested in reading a mostly fair and balanced book on Kim, I suggest you read Dae sook Suh's work on him."
3,"Childrens = Infant to toddler, not child over 5?","I bought these for my 2 boys (2yr & 8yr), but wish they had put a recommended age up to 5 years. I do like them don't get me wrong, but chain only fit my 2 year old. Should state for Infant to Toddler, not child over 5 maybe 6. I know it does state 13"", should've measured my sons neck I guess. Pendant is about half size of a dime, (I thought it would be a little bigger) I do like it, just put another longer chain that I had.Clasp was really hard to lock too, the opening had just enough room for the chain to be pushed in and them clasped shut, other than that is was okay, they do look nice."
4,Perfect for Babies or Toddlers 2 and under.,"As some other reviews have mentioned, this set is not for anyone over the age of 2. The pendant itself is very small and lightweight the image is of angles with a small child. I had bought these for my twins to wear so that they may be reminded that they are never alone and are protected by angels. It was too small for my three year olds so I made it into a pinned charm instead. Works well that way too, I could always purchase a longer chain and probably will in the future. . It is a nice piece of jewelry."
4,Small but beautiful,"This was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, even for a child's necklace. It's beautiful, though, and my great niece was very happy with it when she opened it on Christmas Eve."
4,Small but ADORABLE!!,"The necklace came in a box and velvet bag. What a neat way to send this gift. This necklaces comes just as it looks online and it's that small. I bought it for my three year old nephew, and it's perfect for him. I just hope he doesn't break it before he gets to wear it out!!"
1,Miss leading on how big the pendent really is,From the way the pic look i thought that the pendent was going to be much bigger then a dime if not infact smaller tham a dime
3,Very small,"It's sweet for a baby if deemed safe, but barely visible to the naked eye because it is extremely tiny."
4,"Very,Very Tiny","As the title states, VERY tiny. It is so tiny it's difficult to tell that it is a guardian angel pendent. Can't see it. You would need a magnified glass to tell. The chain isn't worth keeping. I would definitely purchase another chain if you are considering this pendent. I got it for my 5 year daughter as a Christmas gift. One good thing is the pendent/charm has held up well on constant wear. Has not indicated any tarnish effect. I am giving it 4 stars because the description did give measurements and it was prime ship so it did get here quickly. knocked off one star due to the chain."
4,"Good, quick reference book","I saw this book on display at a cooking store and thought it would be good to add to my collection for two reasons. (1) I was making a career change and going to culinary school, and (2) it looked like an all-around good reference. Since buying it I've taken a quick peak at it whenever I prepare something (or eat something) new. It's got just about everything, including things other than spices, like meats and pastas. My only issue with it is the descriptions are very brief. Overall, it's been helpful as a reference for things I haven't worked with before, and how to pair them."
3,TELLING AMERICA'S STORY,"This book is designed to integrate popular children's literature into the study of American history. This is a excellent resource providing lesson plans based on 15 works of historical fiction that trace the country's history from colonial times to the 20th century. Each sections contains a story summary and activities to promote critical thinking skills. Among the books featured are ""This New Land""; ""The Fighting Ground""; Who Is Carrie?""; ""Nettie's Trip South""; ""A Family Apart""; ""Sarah, Plain and Tall""; ""Watch the Stars Come Out""; and ""The Friendship"". The book includes lists of additional novels. An excellent resource for teacher's and home schooling for the middle school grades."
4,Great information...Practical Tools,Leading Innovation is a great resource for leaders at all levels and in all types of organizations. The information provided is presented with clarity and useful frameworks. I also found the tools provided very practical and relevant...a great addition to every leader's toolkit.
4,Best Sounding Xylophone,"We bought this for supervised music time for our 12 month old. I would not recommend for a younger child to play with on their own as the keys are removable and the plastic sticks could be dangerous too. That being said my husband and I love, love, love this glockenspiel! It has crisp, honest sounding notes. It can get loud when hit with force, but what fun is music time if it's quiet."
2,Easily comes apart.,The metal bars come off the pins very easily and can easily be lost! I'm afraid the plastic buttons that the metal notes attach to will easily become loose and break off. Would not purchase again!
4,"It was pretty good, made my hair soft but somewhat frizzy","For me, most of these deep conditioning products will make my hair softer, and more managable, but also a lot of frizzy. This one did just that. I'll try using some heat on it this week."
3,Elfman Attacks!,"Tim Burton and Danny Elfman together again! (after a brief spat that caused Burton to hire Howard Shore for ""Ed Wood"".) I have given this album only three stars because much of it really is not just a good listening album; this is one of those that is clearly meant to accompany the movie. I do, however, have nothing but high praise for his Opening Titles, a composition that successfully presents an atmosphere of comic tragedy (if such a mix is possible). The use of one single musical phrase, repeated, re-orchestrated, made louder and more violent, for two and a half minutes is musical creativity at its highest. (Only Ravel and his ""Bolero"" comes as close to such complex simplicity.) My advice: Find it on sale; used copies at an auction, etc."
3,Middling,"The Inexquisite Eye is the story of Elissa Laughlin, a young lawyer who tries to live her life by adhering to inflexible princples and winds up making a mess of everything. The experience of reading the novel is a bit irritating at times because Elissa herself is irritating. Smith's writing is excellent and consistent throughout. I personally had a hard time with Elissa. She is not a sympathetic protagonist--she annoys everyone in the novel as well. The novel is still interesting because of Smith's writing and what he was trying to accomplish. He examines whether one can actually live by one's principles, when those principles include never trying to please anyone, not even yourself."
2,"Consistently, Persuasively, Boring","The only reason I suffered through this tedious tome was because it was sent to me. Tedious to the nth degree, the self absorbed lives don't deserve to be memorialized in a book. The writing is stilted and stiff and repetitious. Short little sentences describing every boring nuance of lives that move slower than molasses. Dysfunctional families breeding emotionally crippled adults - how original?The most positive thing I can say about the book is that I enjoyed the cover art and the original title. However, the story is devoid of passion, joy and faith and is one of the most tedious things I have read in ages."
4,A literary pleasure,"When I'm reading a good novel, I think about the characters during the course of the day and look forward to my next chance to see how they're doing. Reading The Inexquisite Eye by D.B. Smith was that kind of experience for me. The protagonist, Elissa, is a competent young lawyer whose life has become an anxious maneuvering, both conscious and unconscious, to avoid what she most fears. I followed her path with absorption and caring. The characters in this novel, even the minor ones, are real, interesting, and involving. The plot carried me along, sometimes with riveting suspense, and in the slower-paced sections I relished Smith's clear, revelatory imagery, his rare gift for convincing dialogue, and his insightful comments on human nature, which at times reach directly out to the reader with the coziness of a Victorian novel. I highly recommend this novel for its many literary pleasures."
5,Highly Recommended,"The Inexquisite Eye is a very compelling read. I couldn't put it down once I started it. It's refreshing to read a novel about real people with real flaws. Smith has a good ear for dialogue and offers a sharp focus on the near-misses of human relationships. This is a very well-written book, thought-provoking and full of surprises."
2,"Cheap product, bad price on Amazon.",Amazon's website states the retail price of this product is $29.99 making their price appear to be a deal which is not true. This same product is $24.99 retail and another major retailer and they have instore coupons which bring the price down 20%.The product itself is pretty cheap and I am mad at myself for trying to save $10 each as I think the In-Tension rods at $35 each are a FAR better product. This would be fine for curtains that you rarely use but if you're looking for something that will last I would suggest going with a higher quality product.
2,Falls often,"I have been using this curtain rod for about a month now, and it has fallen down more than five times. Having to re-install it every week gets frustrating very quickly. It would probably get the job done for a curtain that you do not touch or move very often, but if you will be opening and closing the curtain on a daily basis you should expect this rod to come crashing down on your head more than once."
1,not worth wasting your time on,I was truly happy that I found the right size shower rod when I found this one on Amazon. It looked nice when I received it and was happy with it for about 3 months. Now it's a battle with rust and it not staying up...falls about every 3 days. I'm now looking for a replacement.
5,Great Show that uses 40 years of Marvel History!!,"I never expected this show to be as good as it was. Thinking it was only a kids show I easily dismissed it. Watching these shows on video, without those pesky commercials, I have to say this is a great cartoon for all ages. I never thought I'd see all my old cartoon favorites from my Marvel generation. It was terrific to see Captain America, Iron Man and all the Avengers,Defenders and Dr. Strange too! All the Marvel heroes and villians you can think of in one show that doesn't take itself too seriously. I'd reccomend this show to anyone who loves the genre of super heroes."
1,A reach....,"With this type of actor, or with almost any type of actor, it's better to view the material as opposed to reading it. That's why I'd have to endorse another Keanu Reeves bio, but on DVD- KEANU REEVES: JOURNEY TO SUCCESS. For a couple bucks more, you can receive all the info in this book upon your TV screen, with footage, film clips and movie premieres. I know what I'm talking about, I'm Fortunato Plethora."
4,"Great, But Not His Greatest","After losing Steve Van Zandt as songwriter, Billy Rush stepped in and wrote this and the next album. It's slightly schizophrenic as the words are in a more modern style while the tunes and arrangements remain fixed mainly in the R&B style that SSJ married to rock on Hearts of Stone. So if you're paying a lot of attention to the lyrics it can be awkward at times, but if you're just letting it rock you then it's got the same energy and verve as his other best works. If nothing else, buy it for the song ""Time"", with its loping bass, snaky groove in the verses and tight horn arrangement in the chorus. Billy Rush upped the amount of guitars on this and the next album (Love Is A Sacrifice), bringing it more into the 70s and 80s than the first three albums and it works really well."
1,Never Recieved What I Ordered,"I ordered Bayou Classic 7408 Set of Six Fajita Pans, with Wooden Trays and Mitts I only recieved 1. I returned the one as I was asked to. They re-shipped and again I only got 1. I replyed back that I only got 1, I have yet to hear from anyone as to why I only get 1 each time they ship."
1,Thunderbolt?,"The name of this is product threw me. I was looking for a Thunderbolt (Mac) CF reader, not USB 2.0."
4,Better than most,"I have all of Marc Bolan's output as ""T.Rex"", but picked this up before my collection was complete.I must say it is a pretty darn good collection, compared with the hundreds of ""best of's"" on offer.In keeping with the title it contains nothing but the rocky songs Marc did, but still is sequenced well and does not contain demos or really early early stuff disguised as a hits package, which a lot of these collections do."
2,Ran this product for 30 seconds the sent it back,The fan in this product was too loud for use in a bedroom. We sent it back immediately.
2,Be careful,"I purchased 2 units and neither of the air sensors worked. When I called Hamilton Beach, I was informed that they were not covered under warranty because they were over 2 years old. [...]Also....the units were very loud. Much louder than I expected even on whisper mode."
5,FANTASTIC,I AM WELL PLEASED. THE PERFORMANCE ON AUTOMATIC IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I ALSO LIKE THE SMART CENTER THAT MONITORS THE AIR QUALITY AND ADJUST TO WHAT IS NEEDED. THE DELIVERY WAS EXCEPTIONAL ALSO.
3,Not as quiet as I expected.,"I'm satisfied with this price and feature, but the noise is bigger than I expected. Comparing to Sharp one, the noise at the weakest setting is still as big as Sharp's maximum setting.I planed to use this one in children's bedroom, but we put Sharp one instead. Pricewise, it's still good deal though."
4,"Works well, but a bit noisy",This air cleaner works well in our home. I typically have it in our master bedroom on the AUTO setting or in the living room when we are cooking something with strong odor.I wish that it was a bit quieter though. I typically leave it on Whisper setting. My friend has an AirOasis unit that uses Advanced Hydrated Photocatalytic Oxidation (AHPCO) technology. It is very quiet and appears to clean the air just as well. www.cleanairfast.com
5,Be Ready to Dance!,You cannot listen to this CD without a lot of moving around! Makes me wish I knew how to do all the old swing dances. Amazing song arrangements in the big band/swing style. This album is my favorite!
2,Just okay comforter,"This comforter is okay, it's a pretty color. The disappointment was in the pillow shams, they are very thin and don't keep their shape at all. Where I got it, I didn't even get sheets with it, just the comforter, skirt and 2 pillow shams. But it's ok for that price, next time I will spend a little more money and get something that is made better."
1,Montblanc 149 counterfeit,"this seller cashes in on fake Montblanks, he will send it very late and when you get it and find out , not only it's not the model you were promised but it's fake all together, he will promise to refund. but you will never hear from him again.Be very careful."
5,"the ""nib problem""","Classic pice of art. When I lived in Hamburg, Germany, Montblanc was one of the most known companies of the city. The Meisterstück 149 is expensive but brand recognition is guaranteed. You should know that every fountain pen of this company has a handmade nib, so the most important part of the pen is individual. Every single pen has its own style when you write. I bought a 149 and had to return it on the next day, because it scratched. Now, the new one is better for my writing style.The problem is, when you buy a new Montblanc fountain pen, you cannot try out the nib before you buy it... So it remains a challenge to find the right pen."
1,Would be 5 stars without the dialogue,"I don't know what they were thinking. You put it on with four other CDs and hit random. Suddenly, in the middle of your party, study break, etc. there are Paul and Jamie having a fight. I loved the music, but I hardly ever listen to it."
5,"Great, great music","This CD is one of the best soundtracks ever! Through wonderfully-chosen songs, it tells us the Buchmans' story with a great deal of charm. Paul Reiser has great musical taste and is also an extremely underrated composer: the full-length version of ""Final Frontier"" is lovely - and ""Lullabye For You"" is a song of unquestionable beauty. I hope he'll release more of his compositions soon."
4,Nice set of glasses,Bought these as a gift for a Cardinals fan. He loved them! They are a nice set of glasses.
5,For anyone interested in Asian American history,An excellent book for those who are interested in the Asian American experience. Various ethnic groups are surveyed and offer the reader plenty of anecdotal information.
5,Kleenbore Gun care pockit Great handgun cleaning kit easy to take with you.,This is easy to carry with you and it works great.Great for those times when you need a little cleaning to continue shooting.
3,average...but informative,"the overall presentation and framework are sound, scholarly; perhaps due to different viewpoints from various authors, the materials are treated unevenly--some subject matters are in depth, captivating; others are sypnotic, dull at best. overall, this obscure topic was illuminated in a professional, responsible manner. contains a trove of great bibliography and references for research..."
5,Great CD all around,"I have to admit that I bought this CD for ""Burning for you"" by BOC. I can now say this whole CD is full of absolute classics from the 80's (none of that Hair-Band [stuff]).I recommend this to anyone and everyone."
2,What a waste!,"What an incredible voice - so emotionally penetrating it demands absolute quiet around us so we can capture the pure essence of every nuance of the sound she delivers. And yet, such a waste of talent to be relegated entirely to the ""Pop,"" genre. Her voice should be allowed to find expression in the kind of music that is intensely romantic, that haunts the soul, that evokes the subtle, deep, and often fleeting feelings that ""Pop,"" never seems to reach. She should cross over now and sing to the millions of us who are more moved by a sweet, passionate, honest, melodie that speaks directly to the heart, than just ""beat"" or the delivery of some lyrical ""message."""
5,great singer + great songs = great cd,Linda has a beautiful & POWERFUL voice...add that to a great song and you really can't argue with that. Definitely recommended to those who like a great singer!
5,Just stop breathing and listen to Linda sing!,"I've been pseudo-stalking Linda Eder for about four years and talked to her personally on a few occassions and ""WOW!"" what a wonderful Lady!! Oh yeah, did I mention she can sing, too!! Since I first heard her voice, I've literally listened to NOTHING else. Without reservation I can easily recommend any work she has done or will do in the future. Hint, keep checking for the soundtrack to her new Broadway musical, ""Havana"", due out next year. The previews she has given in concert are phenomenal!! Hooray for Linda and husband/composer Frank Wildhorn!!"
4,What a voice!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this one along with the Highlights from Jekyl & Hyde . I had never heard of her until the recent PBS special and then wow... I can't wait until I go to see her in June at Wolf Trap .
3,Excellent Voice; Average Song Selection,"Linda Eder is a fine singer who far too often wastes her time singing bland songs that make her sound like a Barbra Streisand impersonator. This album, for the most part, is no different. In reality, Eder really doesn't sound much like Streisand, in fact, her voice is clearer and more powerful. With far too many of these selections, however, it seems as if Eder is singing Streisand left-overs. The first four tracks sound virtually the same. Then Eder makes the mistake of singing ""Over the Rainbow"" which was best left in the capable hands of Judy Garland. ""Big Time"" offers some spunk as does her unique rendition of ""Man of La Mancha."" ""Candle in the Window,"" ""Only Love,"" and ""Someone Like You"" are also attractive, but the rest of the songs are not really worthwhile. ""It's Time"" proves to be a mixed bag, but overall enjoyable."
5,"Gobble This One Up, Folks!","Most standing ovations are gratuitous and undeserved, but not the three that Linda Eder received at last evening's performance in Chicago. Eder is phenomenal. A rising star. Although I was in row ""X"", I felt as if she was signing every song only to me. Streisand without the attitude. Garland without the mess. This woman is a powerhouse who will hopefully be filling our world with song for years to come. Her voice simply leaves you begging for more."
5,No Barbra Streisand wanna-be,"Before long, the critics will compare Barbra Streisand to Linda Eder, not the other way around!"
2,Hoaky Broadway Stuff,"Anyone expecting the vocal stylings or range of Barbara or Celine will be sadly dissappointed. While her voice suits the Broadway stage, it lacks popular appeal - this voice is not for everyone."
5,Lovely Linda Eder,"I didn't get to Broadway in time to see Linda in Jekyll & Hyde, but just hearing her on the OBC recording was enough to convince me she is the best female singer I have ever heard. I now have many of her recordings, and play them non stop - she is simply amazing. Nuf' said."
5,"Normally, I don't listen to this type of music","I usually don't listen to this kind of music, but Linda Eder is one of the rare exceptions. She has an amazing voice, and this album proves it! This whole cd is good from beginning to end. Buy it. Especially buy it if you are going to take a trip to NY in the winter. The album will act as the soundtrack to the trip when you enter from NJ."
5,The best new album to come out in years!,"I first became aware of Linda Eder when I saw her in Jeckyl & Hyde in 1991 in Houston. Her subsequent albums showcased a great voice that was being wasted with monotanous material. When this CD came out, I was thrilled that Linda had FINALLY recorded music worthy of her voice with arrangements to match! My only complaint is that the first half of this disc is so fantastic that the last 5 selections don't hold up to the excitement and tenderness of the first ten. A singer with this much depth and ability has not recorded since Barbra Streisand or Diane Schurr."
2,"Great voice, lousy material","Having just been blown away by Ms. Eder on a PBS special, I was eager to listen to one of her albums. I was disappointed, unfortunately, with ""It's Time."" Having the composer Frank Wildhorn for a husband has, in my opinion, acted as both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it has provided her with an instant audience, a curse because she's saddled with too much of his under par material. I'm sure Ms. Eder would disagree with me, but it's my review! Even Streisand (whose voice Ms. Eder's resembles at times) recorded mostly standards on her first three albums; only after did she begin slipping in new material. So, this loses stars for me for the mediocre quality of the songs; who wants to hear them twice?"
4,A good value for the price.,"Advertising states that it consistently produces coin-size chips, but does not specify which coin. Mine rarely produces anything bigger than a penny. I use the chips to replace bark as ground cover. It looks attractive, but it remains to be seen whether or not the small chips will blow away. Otherwise, the machine is robust and reduces all of the cuttings I put into it satisfactorily. A machine that would take larger diameter branches would cost significantly more."
3,Interesting review of history for corporate women,"Think we've come far? Ha. This book, while outdated, is just as essential as ""Games My Mother Never Taught Me"". A great history lesson for every woman who wants to get ahead in Corporate America. It may be 25 years later but the games are still the same. If you read this book and see yourself in the pages, you need to act quickly in order to save your career and yourself."
4,So you dont like westerns?,"Well, I'm not a fan of westerns but I am a fan of Richard Matheson so I gave this a try and I think it is one of his best. It is a streamlined novel, it moves along very quickly and manages to be deeply affecting by the end. It is mostly told from the the first person, via a 'record' by the main character Clay Halser, who goes from being a young naive boy to a legendary gunfighter. He finds the excitement he was seeking out West but it's not all he imagined.There is a lot to admire about this novel and yeah, I think someone said it, this would make a great movie."
1,Don't buy the audio version,"Stefan Rudnicki, the reader, will drive you batty.He reads each word in a boring dull monotone with absolutely no emotion or change of inflection. Each word (and sometime each syllable) is carefully pronounced as if it was separated from the others by a period.""I. knew. that. I. was. going. to. lead. a life, of. ex. cite. ment.""I can't comment yet on the content, because I could only listen to it for the little over an hour that it took for me to finish my walk.Based on the other reviews, I will find a hard copy and read it"
4,Quick read,"Interesting and authentic take on the western. It is a more realistic view of the west after the civil war. If you love westerns, pick up this book."
5,Delicious--Will get every year,"I had ordered this for my daughter. My daughter loves caramel apples and Belgian chocolate. So, this looked perfect for her. Originally, it said it wouldn't ship until November 3rd. Personally, I was disappointed that something for Halloween would arrive after the Holiday that it obviously represented. But to my pleasant surprise, it arrived a few days prior to Halloween. It was HUGE. She and her friends thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,DID NOT WORK,My computer said previosly used- and they never worked- I was out of the money and had to buy new ones
3,ok ink,"the black was a bit light and the color had a distinct blue tint, not really a tri color catridge. I probably just got the bad batch but its worth noting. You get what you pay for."
2,Will not work in my HP3100,This is probably a HP issue but my printer will not use these print cartridges. I have used many recycled cartridges with this printer yet these will not work.
4,Great if your on a budget,"This was great, Iwas looking for a low priced ink for my printer and this was what I needed. the only thing is if you want outstanding color then you better get it from the original company< but for all other stuff this is perfect"
2,"One arrived leaking, another went dry after 20 pages","When I received the box of two color, two black cartridges, one of the color cartridges arrived broken, having leaked all over the inside of the box. I inserted one black cartridge and after just 20 pages of printed text (no all-black graphics, or anything), it went dry. I flipped through the pages and saw those tell-tale blank spots. I've just loaded the second cartridge and 20 pages in, it looks fine. But needless to say, it's not exactly great savings when half of what your purchased is useless. I should have just paid full price."
3,Defective Product,"I was not getting any color from the No. 93 cartridge I purchased from this vendor. I contacted them, & after a couple of emails, they said it sounded like the cartridge might be plugged up. She advised that they were sending me a replacement...that was five days ago. In the meantime I am unable to use any colored pictures or grafts. I miss 77lnk & the excellent service they gave me! What happened to them? 11/22/10 I received replacement cartridges this morning, & I am now satisfied...even pleased...with their service."
1,Misleading description,"If you have an HP Officejet 6310, do not buy this product! The No. 92 black cartridge is compatible with the 6310, but the No. 93 color cartridge is not. I'm insisting on an exchange for a correct color cartridge. Amazon should require the vendor to correct this product's description."
2,Disappointed,"This version of what took place in Nebraska in 1958 gives different names and places for the story. This is understandable but the movie is done as if a documentary and does not follow the story written so brilliantly by Jeff McArthur in ""Pro Bono"" which is excellent."
4,Very good band and a good album,"The Muggs have brought back a sound we haven't heard alotof lately... This album is sort of a mix between Led Zeppelinand AC/DC somewhere. Granted, there isn't a great amount ofvariety in this album, but it rocks and rocks hard from startto finish and that's not something you can really say formost albums these.One more thing to be said... These guys aren't afraid to letyou know who they're influences are. With some they mightcome off as just another retro band, but I think they willend up being more.Good hard rock that isn't overproduced. It's about time.Hope they get noticed.4/5 stars"
1,this CD is crippled!,"I wish amazon warned their customers that this CD is crippled by EMI, it does not bear CDDA logo, it uses something called ""copy controlled"" which makes it unusable on whole lot of CD/DVD players.And what's funny, to be able to listen to it, I have to break ""copy control"" first by ripping this disk with cdparanoia. What a pity.Otherwise great CD."
5,Remarkable 'Purple' remix!,"Remarkable, this is one of the strongest remixes of the last decade.Every vocal and every instrument are in perfect balance with each other and are audible in all their clearness.One can realy overhear it in all its dimensions.For instance, snare drum and tambourine are matching very well into each other and are at the same time, quite recognizable.'Burn' and 'Mistreaded' deserve to be hits again. They have a very powerful mix, especially the vocal part and the instrumental solo's. .'Coronarias Redig' is a jewel wich has a timeless dignity of a melancholic, instrumental 'Purple' evergreen and justify its presence on this anniversary edition.If promoted the proper way, this album could hit the charts again.A quality CD together with a comprehensive and interesting booklet !"
4,Stan Martin,"Hopefully if a great singer keeps working hard , He will eventually be given the attention He deserves. Great songs,great music and a great singer."
2,"Useful insights, awful writing","Sieh has useful insights about martial arts but lacks the writing skills (or a decent editor) necessary to convey them clearly. I found that I had to re-read many of his sentences to get his meaning, and the cartoon illustrations often don't help. There are quite a few typos, my favorite on page 34: ""It is a good idea to find a marital [sic] art suited to your stature. If you're big and strong, Judo or Aikido; if you're agile and quick, Escrima or T'ai Chi Ch'uan."""
1,BEWARE!,"A public service advisory: Bose is probably the most evil joke ever played upon audio consumers---buy one of their products and probably about 80% of your money is going directly to their advertising department. Sure they sound pretty good if all you're used to is Walmart off-brands like Durabrand, but there are far better products out there at the same pricepoint. All they do is take mediocre components and hype the living daylights out of them, as well as get them into mass market chains like Best Buy where the average Uninformed Naive Joe Consumer strolls in about to be royally fleeced. Joe thinks he's buying ""High End"" when in fact it's really Low End...only with a High End PRICETAG.You don't need to take my word for it, just go to Internet audio forums likeI'd recommend the Logitech Z-2200/Z-2300 instead, which goes for half to one-third (if you buy it with a rebate) [...]."
2,"OK sound, poor quality of materials","This is one of those products you really don't know what your getting. I found this out after a failure of the Companion 3's. A lightning strike took out the Companion 3's. So I decided to take them apart. Boy, what a eye opener! Being a amateur audiophile since I could read the title on a record album. I was sorely disappointed in the Bass driver which was made of a paper composite and a foam surround. Not what I expected from $250 speakers! The desktop speakers were the same cheap quality. Actually I was surprised considering the Bose do sound pretty good. But for a company who keeps specifications secret and glue's enclosures so you cannot see speaker's. I can only wonder what Bose is trying to do? I have to say from what I have seen of their quality. I don't think I will be buying anything with Bose on it. Unless I can verify I am actually getting something for my money!"
2,Quirky,"I see some reviews that knock the audio quality, but nobody has taken the time to complain about the quirky volume control. The volume knob lets a considerable amount of sound through even when it's turned all the way down, so I'm constantly fiddling with the computer's volume as I toggle between very loud and very quiet. Also, twisting the volume knob up from the ""off"" position has no effect until about 10 degrees of rotation. This gives the system a flimsy feel.The Bose reps I've talked to assure me that this behavior is by design; yours will do this too."
2,NOT..worth the money.,Overpriced at least by 2 and 1/2 times. Take my word for it. I have heard speakers performfor half a century. Using pro rata logic value received is about 1/3 of price. Just an opinion.ie was expecting alot more!
5,"Pricey, but worth their weight in Gold","I cannot say enough about these speakers! The clarity of these tiny Bose speakers is amazing. Just pop in your favorite CD and you're off to heaven. Jazz and classical sound drop-dead gorgeous with this setup. Even MP3s sound crisp, clear and bright!"
1,Poor Product,"Had the speakers for just over 2 months before they broke. Unfortunately, Bose makes you pay for shipping ($$) for repair and it takes 3 weeks. (They do not offer replacements)Since I have a video production biz and cannot be without speakers for that long I have to go out and buy replacement speakers."
1,This item receives no stars,"These were some really great speakers and I loved the wheel module and touch sensitive mute feature. But one day they just stopped working. The light on the wheel module dimmed and the speakers just didn't work. Sound quality was amazing when it did work. But, I wasn't about to pay for shipping to get it repaired. Needless to say that I'm very disappointed. BOSE SUCKS. Simple as that. Take your money elsewhre. I just ordered the PSYC sony speakers. Let's see how those fare."
1,Good when they work,"I bought these speakers to hook up to a Squeezbox head unit ([...]) so I can play music in my living room. Bose has a good name, bit expensive but it is a Bose so I bought them!They sound great when the unit works, but mine stopped working 13 months after I bought them, and on Thanksgiving Day I might add when I have 20 guests coming for dinner and no music to entertain them! I even tried the speakers out using my iPod to make sure it wasn't my squeezbox that was dead. iPod works, squeezbox works, speakers don't!Buy with caution; these may disappoint you in the future when you really need them!!"
2,Nice sound but....,"....the quality is somewhat questionable. After owning these fine sounding speakers for a little over a year, they quit working. You would think that for this much money, that they would last a little bit longer. And, of course, they are only guaranteed for one year. So buyer beware."
2,"All bass and highs, no mid - lousy and disappointing","Just got these from a local retailer and enthusiastically set them up, only to find the sound truly mediocre. It sounds like what it is: Two tiny speakers and a disproportionately huge woofer. There are no mids whatsoever. In fact, there's almost a mental disconnect between the shrill highs coming from the little speakers and the muffled thump coming from the woofer. It's like playing the music out of way-cranked-up headphones as they sit on your desk and in the background your neighbor is cranking the bass on a huge stereo. With all this said, it's probably fine - and even exciting - for gaming. But if you're interested in this for music, look elsewhere. I just wish I knew where exactly to look."
2,Disappointed.,I own a lot of WWII documentaries. This one is poor in my opinion mainly due to the fact that I saw the same film work used in other documentaries that I already owned. I had hoped for new footage of the D-Day landings but there was none. Save your money and use it to buy other documentaries instead.
3,It's not the small one,"You may buy this thinking it is a joint for the fuel system return line, but it is the larger 5/16"" pipe, not the 1/4"" pipe. I missed that on the product description."
1,Not impressed with the 3102,I bought this tool as an upgrade to my HF die grinders. I've owned it 8 months and only used it occasionally. The motor now feels like crap and wont hardly turn. The head came loose and is now out of adjustment. There are no papers on setting it and since I didn't register it in the first 6 months I can't get it warranted now. Did I mention it was made in China? A waist of $120. It may of had more power than my HF knock offs but they have at least been dependable.
1,Don't waste your money,"Got this grinder because of IR's reputation for air tools and the price was about what the ""tool truck"" guys wanted for their off brand Chinese stuff. Turns out this one is made in China too. Overall looks like it is built better than some of the off brand stuff other guys in the shop have but performance sucks! The bearings feel loose and are noisy brand new. Biggest complaint though is the throttle, or lack of. The trigger sticks terribly and once pressed it pops to full throttle, not much control over speed. I won't be wasting the extra money for IR tools anymore."
5,Loved the movie...been trying to get the CD ever since,"The on-line requests are starting to pile up on this one. Come on, Amazon...get with the program. I'm also glad to know that I'm not the only person on this planet who has searched in vain for this CD. I thought that scene where Gary Oldman does the video shoot for ""My Way"" was great."
5,Sid And Nancy,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
5,Awesome...BUT,Great collection of artists and songs but.... I wish they would have featured ALL of the songs from the movie on the soundtrack. I've been looking everywhere for a song by Pearl Harbour and The Palaminos that was played in the scene where Sid was in the bed cutting his chest. It's called 'Two Bullets' They only played a snippet. But you can see the song in the movies music credits. Does anyone have any info at all about this song? I would be very grateful!My email:Queenohearts1011@aol.com
5,"Brilliant Soundtrack MUST be re-issued, please, please!","When I lent out my tape to a friend and never saw it again, I was very angry. Now I can't find the CD or tape or anything and I am heartbroken. This soundtrack must be re-issued. I cannot live without the angst-ridden fury of Circle Jerk's Love Kills, or Steve Jones, or the Pogues. UHHHHHHHHHH! Bring it back. Re-unite my Repo Man Soundtrack with its brilliant companion."
5,"""Haunted"" by The Pogues is truly worth 5 stars on its own!","Sid and Nancy is the film that made me love Gary Oldman...Haunted is the song that made me love The Pogues! I don't understand how The Pogues could release a ""best of"" album with this track omitted! Like so many others, I too am searching for my favorite soundtrack on CD format. Please reissue this, Amazon! What is my reason for wanting this soundtrack? ""..I wanna be haunted by the ghost, of your precious love..."" To prove my my point, I'm even wearing hippy clothes!!!Sid & Nancy forever....LOVE KILLS"
5,Great CD,"When people buy a brand new CD, it's usually for 1 song, maybe 2 or 3 at the MOST... They always deliver with several songs that are smash hits and other songs that you can really enjoy."
3,All right...,It wasn't the greatest CD All 4 One has put out. Where were the singles from Space Jam and Hunchback?! It was all right but 5 stars?! It wasn't that great!!!!
1,"Beautiful Design, Horrendous Editing","Weinmann is a reknowned expert in her field, but you wouldn't know it from this book. The text is replete with sloppy mistakes -- from annoying typos and miscaptioned images to plain, old wrong information, including even basic HTML syntax. The book reads like a term paper that was written in an ""all nighter"" without a second look. Did Weinmann not have an editor for this title?The problem with this book is that if you're a beginner, you're likely to be confused by the numerous errors. On the other hand, if you already know enough web design to spot the errors, then there's not much new to be learned from this volume --certainly not enough to justify its hefty price tag.In short, this is a nice book to lay out on your coffee table, but not one to rely on for solid design strategies."
1,Not a book I would recommend,There are less expensive books out there that do a better job. The errors in this book are inexcusable.
2,"This woman is, like, so full of herself.......","At first I was very impressed by this book. It looked so good (nice illustrations) and I thought it was just what I needed. But was I disappointed! I can get this useless information in any $ 20.- book, and better. But the worst part is that Lynda thinks so much of herself. What it comes down to is what she herself calls in this book: ""shameless self-promotion""! So if you're interested in her father's website....."
2,Take Caution -- Book is probably not for you!!!!!!,"This book attempts to cover too many specific design packages. You are presented with step by step instructions on how to do so and so using either photoshop, imageready, fireworks, and sometimes other packages. All instructions and illustrations are on a MAC. I got tired of reading the same old stuff. Once she tells you how to do it in one package she goes on to explain it in the remaining 3 or 4..... Soooooo repetitive. Not worth the money and not a good read for the pc user. Mac maybe."
3,Wordiness detracts from the content,"My limited knowledge on the subject made this book educational. It was written like most of us speak (phrases like ""ya gotta"") which made it easy to understand, but also made it VERY wordy and repetitive. . .10 pages of reading felt like 1 page of learning. Bulleted chapter summaries and excessive pictures only made this worse. If you are new to the subject, then you should find it useful, but if you're buying it based on content, it is definitely not worth the price."
2,Sloppy errors make me unsure of what info to trust!,I noticed several content errors right off the bat and now I'm not sure if I can trust ANY of the advice in the book. The first error I noticed would cause my pages to have broken graphic icons! Is Lynda Weinman resting on her laurels here and getting lazy?
1,When web designers print...,"Any useful information in this book was overshadowed by sloppy errors and dumb mistakes. The amount of mistakes I found in the coded examples was ridiculous. This book desperately needed an editor. Deconstructing Web Graphics was just as bad. I used to enjoy Lynda Weinman's books for their simple, low pressure aproach to web design, but I doubt I'll be buying another one of her books at this point.This sloppy, what-the-hey-they'll-buy-it-anyway attitude shows a blatant disregard for people who have been reading her books in the past.Shame, shame..."
3,You already know 70 percent...,"If you (have to) make pages for a living, chances are you already know 70 percent. Designing Web Graphics 3 focuses too much on HTML, but fails to do that thoroughly. I understand why it's in there, but I don't need tutorials on frames and tables. Buy this [expensive!] book for the other 30% you might not know.."
1,Wordy and MUCH to general to be useful...,This book travels the same ground that several others do - just not as well! This coupled with the fact that the book is short on specifics and long on gereralities combines to make it a poor value. Also (PC users be ware) the screen shots are all Mac - a failing common to other books by this author. Bottom line - save your money and look elseware.
1,Just another web book,"When the first of Weinman's books came out, many designers were still new to the medium of the web (all of two or three years ago). Now, designers dedicated to the web are up to speed, and books like this have less and less to offer.More to the point, many of the best resources for learning about web graphics, or design, or technology, are on the web itself. And web-based resources are typically much more up-to-date.Furthermore, Weinman is not herself a particularly good designer or graphic artist. As one other reviewer has noted, like many web ""experts"", her chief skill is brazen self-promotion."
5,Outstanding! Absolutely perfect!,"This is definitely one of the top 10 book available on programming. Plus, it's highly readable & highly informative. Kudos to Lynda on writing such an excellent tutorial & reference.I have Version 2 of this book, and that's what really got me going with web design."
5,touch of home,living in Japan one is isolated from mainstream America..this is my link and connection to home..Absolutely loved this series... Thank you for the entertainment and simple pleasures of being an Americanthat so many take for granted!
1,Desperate Housewives,Very disappointed in the seventh season of Desperate Housewives. I returned my first purchase. My second purchase was fine until the last disc. I can't watch it. I keep getting the message that it's a bad disc. Probably won't be buying any more from Amazon.
3,Desperate Housewives 7,"This was purchased as a Christmas present. I received it after Christmas. Unfortunately, the set came with two Disc 3's and the 4th Disc was missing. When I called for a replacement Disney Studios was courteous and helpful. They sent me a return label and envelope. When they received Disc 3 they determined it was a Pirated copy and could not replace it with the missing Disc 4. It was promptly returned to me. I was advised to contact the shipper. I did that with no response so we will never know what happened in the 7th season Disc 4."
1,Horriable quality,"My wife is addicted to this show. Every year I go to BestBuy and get her the newest season. This year I thought to avoid the crowds I would simply order it....BIG MISTAKE!! Product came no problem, and looked brand new as though I bought it from a larger store here at home. When my wife opened the package 3 of the 5 discs were severely scractched and took a lot of work to play. 5 disc set....the 5th disc was labeled #5 but when we tried to play it the title screen said #4. So now I have a junk set of movies and for her to watch the last disc I need to jump through a million hoops or buy another copy at BestBuy..... I will never make this mistake again."
3,Got ripped of,"Great series and could not wait to start watching. But my second disk does not work. Unfortunately I bought it at the local store and did not keep the receipt ,so check it asap when buying."
2,Renée on the front!?,I must say even this mediocre season's DVD cover is irritating. Why they put Renée on the front like she is the lead character? Actually in some episodes we see her in like 10 minutes. Re-organize this stupid cover please. ANYONE AGREE?
3,"Still love the show, but mixed feelings about continuation","I have been a huge fan of this show since season 4 and have since then watched all of the episodes. I got all excited at the season 6 finale, and this season had a lot of great stuff in it.However, good things must come to an end, and I was hoping that this season would be the one to wrap it all up. Some of the plot twists in this season felt somewhat forced, and with the season finale that happened with Gabrielle's stepfather left me with the sinking feeling that with that episode, this show that I have loved for a long time may have jumped the shark. I will watch season 8, but I'm afraid it'll just get silly.Edit - I hear now that Season 8 will be the last one. This makes me sad, but also relieved."
4,Vanessa Williams was a good choice to play The Fifth Desperate Housewife.,"And in fact, She did have some shoes to fill in for Nicollette Sheridan. Vanessa's character, Renee Perry arrived in Fairview, She was at first was playing Wilhelmina Slater, The Character she played on ""Ugly Betty"". But Renee is not a very slutty woman like Edie Britt. But She's pretty much down to Earth. On The other hand, This happens to be The 8th and final season of ""Desperate Housewives"", and here's to the best season-ever. The ladies will leave Fairview on a high note, And as far as the actresses who plays them, I hope you'll find better things down the road."
5,great buy,"product at a good price in excellent conditions,better price than regular stores, got it within a week,love desperate housewives,really like the amazon system,great selection."
3,Mixed Review,"This is a large book and does have some interesting recipes. However, mostly high calorie options. There isn't much fresh and inviting."
5,Awesome!,The photo is of a red/yellow one. The one we got was a teal with yellow. I'm glad we got the teal one - it's exactly the same as the one we use in music class. It's a fun toy. Teaches coordination skills to make the clacking noise. Great for 1year+. The bright colors are attractive. It also looks and feels heavy duty so it's not something he'll break easily - which is key since he's broken a lot.
3,Not Much To It,"A little direction of use would be nice on the outside of the package. My husband and I worked for a while to make some sounds with the Clatterpillar and with not much luck. It doesn't do a lot. It's headed to my daughter's preschool, so I hope the kids are more coordinated than we are."
2,Should Have Passed,I wish I had passed on this musical toy. Not much to it really and my kids lost interest very quickly.
5,bow sight for recurve,for the price and cost of shipping this sight is great value.an excellent start in sight equipment i give this 100%.
2,It's an Okay Product,The base of the sight would not fit to my bow so I had to use a previous base that I had to attach the rest of the product to the bow. There's not a lot of instruction on how to assemble and zero in this sight and I had to search online and perfrom trial by error to zero in the sights. So far the sights are pretty rugged and it works pretty well. I would recommend this product to someone that knows how the base will fit in with thier bow.
5,Overwhelming Information,I read this book from the very beginning and made notations where I needed to improve my habits around my alpacas. They now are more relaxed around me and other people. This book is also very heart warming too. Great pictures to help you to understand what it is that these animals require. I am using this book as a reference also.
4,great book for a good price,I bought this book from Amazon because it was cheaper to buy it in the U.S then in my country in Europe!A must have book for Alpaca owners
5,Great book for new owners,"As a new alpaca owner I found this book a great help. It contains a clear plan to create the kind of relationship I want with my animals. It is very sensitive to natural camelid behaviour and works with these instincts which I feel has to create a more harmonious bond. I especially like that the emphasis is on handling rather than training as your animals don't differentiate between the two and most of the time spent with them is day to day handling tasks. I believe that a lot of established owners could learn from this book, maybe my animals wouldn't have come to me as fearful and nervous if their previous owner had worked through this book. Any book on handling/training is not a strict manual, you have to take the bits that work for you and create your own plan. This book provides a solid foundation to do just that."
5,GREAT SET,"This set of the Blind Dead Series is as good as you could expect for these old movies. It has every movie in full Spanish version with English subtitles AND the English versions dubbed. I prefer the Spanish versions as they are uncut and have all of the original scenes but it is nice to have the option of watching either version of either movie. It also has a nice book with history about the movies and the making of the movies. The coffin case is simple but cool. Takes up a little more space then if it were a rectangular set as you can see in the picture but that is part of the fun of it. The only thing that would be better is if they were on blu-ray, but blu-ray can only restore old movies like this so far that they are not much better than DVDs (for old movies like these at least). Great product if you are a fan of the Blind Dead Series or of the death/doom metal band; Hooded Menace."
5,Blind Dead Collection DVD,At last these hidden gems are getting the release they deserve. An excellent restoration job that makes those blind dead knights look like they were intended to: gorgeous. Thumbs up for Blue Underground!Keep up the good job for all your future release
2,stopped working after about 2 years,It started out doing it's job and then stopped working. I replaced it with a card reader that was multi-functional and am very happy with the change.
4,"Not fantastic, but adequate","If you're looking for something to hold expensive CDs or DVDs, then this case is not for you. It doesn't provide very good protection and it has a plastic cover. However, if you just need somewhere to store data discs, I recommend this case. The price is far lower than Case Logic or similar brands."
3,Lack of information,I bought the product but I never cound find information about the audio language so I could know the answer until receive the product. The only available language is english so I can not show the DVD to my childs because we are in MexicoI suggest to put complete info about the products you offer on your online system
1,Eight hours of shoddy images :^(,"An aviation buff, I thought I could not go wrong getting this 4-DVD documentary for less than $20. I was wrong. This is far from the documentary quality one can find on the History and Discovery channels, in fact it actually reminded me of the murky and dull 16mm films seen in school (half a century ago) as a feeble gesture toward audio-visual ""education"".Most of the early archival film clips didn't look as good as similar clips seen on TV, while the newer clips were almost uniformly unsharp or in bad color. The narration was half-decent, but overall the visual quality was so lacking this entire production seemed a distinctly amateur project done on a shoestring.I had been fooled into thinking this DVD set might be a quality item because of the packaging in a neat metal case. I might as well keep the case and throw away the DVDs. The DVD publisher Madacy is one I DEFINITELY will try to avoid in future."
1,Very Narrow Subject Matter,"I actually mistakened this DVD set for The Century Of Flight made by Time Life Video in the late 1990s. (Please make THIS series in DVD format!). When you look at the two, there is virtually no comparison. Madacy's A Century of Flight covers very little about the history of aerial warfare. It has a brief segment on World War I; World War II takes up a whole disc but is told only from the American point-of-view. Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War are not covered at all! The series only covers the history of U.S aviation, exempting of course the topics listed above. My verdict: the series seems like something an elementary school class might find interesting (only because they'd rather watch TV than do written assignments) but to someone seriously interested in aviation; like the previous review says: Avoid at all costs."
4,Aviation History Recorded,"With some minor flaws, for less than $ 20, this is a good collection of aviation history.Going from the orginal, which has probably been copied several times, to DVD some quality has been lost, but still preserves the history of aviation and the type of movie photography for that time. Even though some main events of aviation history are not covered.Anyone wanting a basic knowledge of aviation, and how it developed, this collection, you can't go wrong for the price.Richard L. Holmes"
1,Avoid at all Costs !!!,Warning: this is a re-issue of a old Madacy program called '' a century of flight''Just the fact that it was produce by Madacy is all you need to know about its abysmal quality.If you look that program up on amazon.com you will see the poor reviews that it has...
2,Compact and works great! --- NOT SO MUCH!,"Bought this for my kitty powder room and love it! It's small, compact, easy-to-use and cleans well. I don't hang it so I'm not sure if that is ""awkward"". No complaints! At Amazon to buy a couple more. Hoping they haven't somehow screwed up the quality like so many products these days. Will let you know! :-)Revision: The other reviewer was correct about this item when it comes from Amazon. Very disappointed. I think they were stored incorrectly because the dust pan is warped and does not make good contact with the floor. Bought 3 of these at Amazon and all are the same. Stay away...I changed my review from 5 stars down to 2 only because I know that the one I bought at the store worked fabulously. The potential of a great product exists. Too bad Amazon has stored them in a manner that damages them."
1,Save your money,"This video is just one poor shot placement after another. I've never seen so many unethical shots. At one point, when they can't get a shot with their bow, the pull out a handgun and start flinging lead at a distance far greater than the effective range of the weapon. By the end of this video, you'll find yourself pulling for the hogs! I know there are few hog hunting videos out there to choose from, but don't waste your money on this one."
1,very poor shooting and hunting ability,"I bought this video because I`m a hog hunter myself but these guys should have waited to put out a video until they know more about hunting and learn to shoot better. They take to many stupid shots and when they do finally hit the animal it is usually in the guts. It was awful to see one shot in the guts and then they chase it another hour (that is what they say in the video)with his guts hanging out,make four more shots (all of them misses)before they kill the hog,and then they do not show the killing shot.Then they show the hog dead with a arrow sticking in his front shoulder that anyone can see was stuck in him after he was already dead.Please do not buy this video! Buy a Dan Fitzgerald hog hunting video and you will love to watch it over and over."
3,DVD is a Fad [chuckle],"I agree with the first reviewer.. This DVD thing is a Fad [chuckle]. Got my DVD player early on, hooked it up through the SVHS port on my TV and connected my Dolby Pro Logic (ahh.. the old days) Receiver to it. It was awesome then (first reviewer obviously hooked his up wrong) and it is crazy awesome now with DTS/Dolby Digital via Optical Digital Inputs and Component Video. Nothing touches it!!VHS, what's VHS? Is that like 8Track or something?hehehe"
2,The Journal of Biddy Owens,"I give The Journal of Biddy Owens two stars. Although I am a big fan of Baseball I am not a big fan of this book. This book was kind of boring to me. It's about a 17 year old kid who loves baseball. He is the equipment manager for the Birmington Black Barons, one of the best teams in the Negro leagues. The main character , Biddy tells about his experiences traveling with the team and the prejudice they encounter. Although I enjoyed reading about their eperiences I wanted to know more. I think the author could have told more about Biddy's friends,his life in the neighborhood and his encounters with prejudice. I also think the author could have told more about characters and their relationships. This book kept me wanting more information,descriptions and details. To me this is not a must read book."
4,The Best way vto learn about negro league baseball,I really like the book The Journal of Biddy Owens. It was about a boy from Birmingham Alabama at the age of 17 he was playing on a Negro league team called the Black Barons. They played on away team fields or their home field Rickwood. The Black Barons had to travel all around the United States to play against 11 different Negro league teams and some Rookie teams. There where some many talented ball players on the team and there was one who was the leader who is the second baseman named Piper. They where a very outgoing team like going to restaurants and meeting new people. The team mad it all the way to the championship. I liked the author because he used very descriptive words and the best was that he uses dates and not chapters. I would recommend this book because it was very well written and descriptive.
1,Extremely boring.,"I read this book because I like the My Name is America series. I was very dissapointed when I read it, however. It was boring and it was all about baseball. I would not reccomend it at all."
4,good stuff,I am very happy with this Robanda product. It hasn't totally removed my age spots from my hands but it has lighten them up noticeably. It does have a scent which I have gotten used to. I'm especially happy that there is a sunscreen as I don't usually apply sunscreen on my hands.
2,1 star for the AWFUL fragrance & 4 stars for results,"I think this probably works well, but cannot stand the heavy perfume fragrance they added, so don't use it regularly. Only get this if you can find a fragrance free version!Why do most manufacturers of great moisturizers & night creams add fragrance???"
3,OK,"creamy consistency, good smell, haven't used that long, so don't know if it will help wrinkles - price is good, but not sure yet if will purchase again - my old hands need lots more than this"
1,Didn't work.,It doesn't really work for me. My spots are still there.Just one more cream to add to the rest.The cream is nice though.Darn it.
3,Overwhelming fragrance,"I love the idea of an anti-aging hand cream -- fading spots and sun protection are really important for my often-forgotten hands. The silkiness of the handcream is quite good, though you can feel that ""slip"" you feel with sunscreens.My issue is the unbearably strong soapy, baby lotion-y fragrance. It conflicts with my perfumes and I don't particularly like the smell - so I use it sparingly (or rarely). If they made this in a fragrance free version, I'd jump.For now, I'll stick to the Paula's Choice Resist anti-aging hand cream."
2,Not moisturizing enough,"This product may be good but I haven't noticed...my hands feel very dry all the time, even right after applying it...will go back to DermaE antiaging, it worked much better..."
4,Works good with continued use.,"I have been using this product for a year now. I would recommend to anyone who has discipline and will use diligently.After about 3 weeks I noticed a marked difference in the few brown spots I was looking to fade. The key is to keep using it.I will sometimes get lazy and not put sunscreen on the back of my hands when exposed to the sun for longer periods oftimes...then I will go right back to using the cream and the spots fade back up. I do not use like a hand lotion though, I onlyuse the cream on the back of my hands and wrist. For the cost I don't want to waste the cream on my palms, etc. For mepersonally it smells nice, not offensive in anyway."
3,Indifferent?,"Well, I'm not sure if it's the product or the vendor who sold it to me through Amazon, but the bottle came worn down a bit and it made me wonder how old the product might be? If this had been sitting on their shelf past the expiration date, then, I was jipped. It does soften hands but as to whether or not I've seen improvement in age spots? If there has been a change, it has been very slight & I've had the product for over a month and use it at least once a day."
3,average at best,"This CD is represented as a ""sampler"", but it is more of a promo for the McMasters. The music is average at best, in my opinion."
4,"Awesome, but the 2 disc collection is better","I have always been a huge fan of Jekyll and Hyde. The music is at times dark, deep, evil and threatining but at times slow and relaxing. I think that the musical is in every way superior to the book. No offense, Robet does a good job playing J and H on this recording, but the 2 disc ""Jekyll and Hyde: the gothical music thriller, the complete work"" is in every way superior. For one thing, it stars Anthony Warloc, who has the best singing voice there is in the world, and all of the songs are moving and you can feel their pain. This recording seems a little devoid of emotion. But it is still a very good recording. I would, however, recommend the 2 disc collection"
3,Not completely a hair-flipping good time.,"Linda Eder and Christiane Noll sound great on this OCR. Robert Cuccioli sounds like Robert Cuccioli. Beyond that... Well, do you like Frank Wildhorn? If so, you'll probably enjoy this recording of Jekyll & Hyde. Be aware, though, that lots of changes have been made to the score, so you may find some of your favorite songs missing. Most of the music sounds somewhat disconnected from any dramatic association, which makes this disc almost a flawless representation of the stage show. If you like Jekyll & Hyde, or are otherwise a Wildhorn fan, you need to own this disc. Otherwise, flip your hair--and turn your head--the other way."
2,Hmmmm,"The good things about this CD: Christiane Noll is better than Carolee Carmello, and the chorus has a much better, tighter sound. The Bad things: No ""I Need To Know""? What were they thinking? I think the show overall has lost some of what really frightened me on the concept recording. And I can't stand Robert Cuccioli. He has a nice voice, but as Hyde, he sounds like a villain from a Disney cartoon. No One can surpass Anthony Warlow, IMHO. And to whoever said he was a Tenor...He's a BARITONE. And he's definitely not 'Operatic'. Yes, he is an Opera singer, but he has SO MANY strings to his bow, and on Jekyll & Hyde he's not what I would describe as Operatic. GET THE CONCEPT RECORDING!"
2,Sappy musical,"I bought this because I am in a production of it.The music is swampy and overblown and the singing is loaded with annoying pop-yodelling ornamentations. Despite this, there are a few very nice songs: ""His work and nothing more"" and a tango Lucy sings."
5,My new favorite musical,This is one of the best musicals to come off of Broadway since Les Mis. I love the music - Linda Eder and Robert Cuccioli have captured the passion of the characters in their singing. I just can't wait to actually see it someday.
5,PHONOMENAL,"Jekyl and Hyde is a wonderful show. Though this was Frank Wildhorn's first musical is has become the most successful of his three shows. When it opened it recieved terrible reviews and was not nominated for best new musical. That rediculous Juan Darien went in place of it. Titanic won best musical that year and now, Jekyl and Hyde is the only musical from that season to still be running!!!!!!! The show has been running longer than Titanic!!!!!!! Imagine that!!!!!!!"
3,So-so,"(I really could not decide between 2 and 3 stars but sice my review focuses on the bad I will let my star rating focus on the good)When I first heard Jekyll and Hyde I laughed and I still don't know if Pity or disgust was the strongest emotion. But after listening to all the songs several times I have come to like some of the of them very much and have found others unbearable! Such songs like ""Good and Evil"" have no place on the professional stage, especially in a period piece, yet there are others that are good. While this musical is nowhere near my favorite it has an addictive and hypnotic quality to it that make owning it not such a burden. I do listen to my favorite songs quite a bit but over all I would say it needs an acquired taste."
2,"Toned-down, less moving than previous version.","I found it lacking the power and movement the previous one had, as if it was scaled down to attract a wider range of viewers and/or listeners. Also, there was a more push on the classical style of singing over the music itself."
5,Ehh,"I am a huge fan of Jekyll and Hyde. It is my all-time favorite musical. But I have to say, I really didn't care for any of the actors who played Jekyll and Hyde during its Broadway run. David Hasslehoff was medicore, along with Jack Wagner. Sebastian Bach was just terrible. Rob Evan just doesn't have a good voice. Robert Cuccioli has an okay voice. It's decent, but not exactly good. Oh, he has some good moments during some of the songs in this CD, such as the chilling Confrontation, which I thoroughly enjoyed. But overall he just is not very good.The rest of the cast was superb. Murder Murder was tons of fun to listen to, as well as Facade. The song, In His Eyes was powerful and moving, sung by the two female leads, the characters Emma and Lucy. Special recognition goes to Linda Eder, who was especially superb as Lucy. Linda Eder also sung the part of Lucy in the Jekyll and Hyde concept album with Anthony Warlow, which I would highly recommend getting either instead of or along side this CD."
5,One Of The Best,"First off, let me tell you that I have not listened to the other ""Jekyll and Hyde"" recordings all the way through. I have hard snippets of them though. Now that that is established, I can say that this musical ROCKS. Whoever says that Robert Cuccioli's voice sounds like fingernails on a chalkboard when he sings the title role--Are you sure you were listening to the right musical? His voice is great. I am a music perfectionist, and can not stand people who sing with too much of a vibrato, or go sharp or flat. He does not do either of the two. He is Great. Linda Edner is AMAZING. Her voice is like a bell. She hits every note perfectly. Everyone else is great too. I can not help but tear up at the end. This and RENT are the only cd's that I do not hit the skip button at all. I wish I could have seen this show. Please get this, and support the sales so they might re-release this show on broadway. Viva Jekyll and Hyde."
2,Enjoyable in parts but derivative overall,"Wildhorn writes tunes that I'm sure professional skaters will use in exhibitions for years to come.As far as his Broadway career goes...I think that's gonna be somewhat shorter. He cobbles together FM-lite power ballads and chorus songs with weak storylines and covers it all in sugary emotion. He yanks the story around to make sure his song fits rather than writing his song to fit the existing story.There are some hummable bits and pieces and the female leads' voices can be enjoyable except when Linda Eder decides that *every* song needs a big vocal finish. I would also agree with the reviewer that said to get the CDs with Anthony Warlow as Jekyll. His voice is an absolute *treasure*. Robert Cuccoli tries hard, but he can't convey the emotional range that Warlow can.P.S. Buy the other Anthony Warlow CDs. They're imports, but they're worth it!"
3,Could Be Better,"This recording is not bad, but it can't hold a candle to the Complete Work with Anthony Warlow. That recording includes many songs that were cut or replaced from this one. The cast on that recording was superior to this cast, as well. Don't misunderstand---this recording is good, but the other one was a tough act to follow. If you can only afford one recording, I would advise you to buy the Complete Work."
4,Great musical score.,Music is fantastic with the big number being This is the Moment. Rich vocals throughout. Definitely worth a listen especially because story is told through the music.
3,Be Warned,"I first saw Jekyll & Hyde on Pay Per View, with David Hasselhoff as Jekyll and Hyde, (yes, he's the Baywatch guy, lol.) I immediatley got hooked. I bought the cd because I really loved Hyde's (and most of Jekyll's) passionate wild songs, and I really, really loved ""Dangerous Game"". So I bought this cd, expecting the same big, dramatic redemption of Hyde and Jekyll's pieces. I was sorely dissapointed to find that Robert Cuccioli has a weak and flat-sounding voice. Both Christiane Noll and Linda Eder have gorgeous voices, but I was really dissapointed in Robert Cuccioli's performance. Just don't expect anything dramatic or wonderful from his songs. The chorus numbers are good though, and all of Linda Eder's solos are wonderful. :-)"
1,porblems!problems!,"first, I got the package after almost a month!- postal office lost it, I guess!-but after only 5 days after purchase, collector agency started calling, to recuperate the money, cause what had happened was that the ""machine"" did not read the credit card info, so that it was not paid for. anyway, I had to pay for it, although I did not receive it.and, btw, the CD is HORRIBLE!"
1,"Makes me want to ""Hyde"" and (Je)kyll myself.","Dear Frank Wildhorn:STOP WRITING MUSIC FOR THEATRE. If I wanted to hear your music performed, I would go see a Celine Dion show. Unfortunately for her, I wouldn't pay to see her, either. Why do you insist on writing 90's power ballads and trying to slam them into a show set in another century? I highly doubt Robert Louis Stevenson was singing power ballads while he was writing this. Hunter Foster poops out better songs than you write."
2,Not as Good as the 2-CD Set,"I have all three versions of this musical: highlights, 2 CD Set and this most recent version. Of them all, the 2 CD set is the best. I was very disappointed in the dramatic changes to this version. It pales in comparison to the 2 CD set. While Linda Eder is superb in anything she does, the song ""Good and Evil"" does not justify her capabilities as did the song ""Bring on the Men"" in the 2 CD set. Many of the songs' intensity is missing from this version. All disappointments aside, this is a good CD, just not as dynamic, intense or as soul-touching as the 2 CD set."
4,Solid album,A good recording for any fan of the show or theater music.No complaints- original artists in full showing.Original Broadway Casts are the way to go.
5,One of my most favorite musicals :),"I'm always surprised that a lot of musical fans aren't way into Jekyll & Hyde - particularly this version.For one, it's one of the few musicals in which every single song is amazing - well written, well performed, and well placed. The music isn't lost in caricature voices that a lot of other musicals have, and the tropes, while present, are not jammed down your throat. Overall, it's an amazing piece of work and likely my all-time-favorite musical.This version in particular, I adore. I'm not sure I agree with some of the other reviews - that this recording lacks some of the passion, etc of a live performance - in my recordings, I'm basically there for the music, and a lot of live performance doesn't translate well to recorded medium, in my opinion. That said, I think this is as emotionally poignant as it needs to be. Robert Cuccioli is absolutely amazing in his role, and his transformation, even recorded, is positively chilling.Five stars from me - I adore it. :)"
2,"Where is ""Bring on the Men""? Buy the 1994 cast recording.","The two best songs in Jekyll & Hyde were ""Bring on the Men"" and ""Letting Go"". Why are they missing from this disk? Don't buy this version. Get the 1994 recording of the original Jekyll & Hyde. If you buy this 1997 version you won't hear the best songs."
3,"Pretty ballads, but that's it.","I have not heard any other musicals by Frank Wildhorn. However, if this recording is used as a representative of his music, I can easily say that Mr. Wildhorn can write a nice, catchy ballad but very little else. ""Once Upon A Dream"" and ""This is the Moment"" are pretty, though formulaic, songs that one goes around humming now and then. I also enjoyed ""Take Me As I Am"" and ""In His Eyes"". However, the more ""upbeat"" and ""fast"" numbers are disappointing bores which make you wear out the track-change button. ""Facade"" is the best and it's not even particularly good. In fact, it is extremely reminiscent of ""At The End of the Day"" from Les Miserables. Both comment on how poor the society is from the viewpoint of the lower-classes and have, in fact, rather similar tunes. ""Good 'N Evil"" might have been a good song if it weren't for the pointlessness of it. In fact, the best songs, the only ones that make this CD even partially worthwhile, are the ballads. But they're it."
1,Jekyll & Hyde : a pop musical,"Jekyll and Hyde may not be your best Broadway show currently playing now on Broadway, but songs in this CD are definitely enjoyable. pop tunes, lounge tunes are all incorporated in this CD. If you wants to listen to a relaxing pop music, this is your Cd , but if you are looking for a good theatrical piece...this is not definitely your CD..."
2,Clipped for the sake of space.,"This offering was greeted with wanton anticipation. Having seen J&H a few years ago I longed for this release. Unfortunately, the most dramatic parts, (Lucy's murder and the quasi-suicide of Jeckyll) were left off, for the sake of keeping thismusical to one CD. 73:40. How obvious is that? It is a shame that this disc which is filled with excellent performances and rich music is compromised for economy's sake. I'd have paid more for the real thing."
4,"Enjoyable; Not the ""ultimate"" musical, though","After all the hype, I had to listen to the soundtrack. Granted, it's not Les Miserables or Phantom, but it resembles Les Mis in it's style. Music is a little predictable, but if you liked Les Mis, chances are you'll enjoy Jekyll&Hyde."
2,Takes some getting used to,"I was first introduced to this wonderful score though the 1990 concept album. I will tell you that is the perfured version of them all. Still I bought this album to see how much further Mr.Wilburn could take his music. When I first heard the final product I was discusted when I heard a much weaker opening then ""I Need To Know."" The problems didn't stop there. ""Facade"" was completly distroyed by his editing. Why he took out ""Bring on the Men"", one of my personal favoret songs in the album, I will never know. Finaly ""This is the Moment"" and ""Alive"" was murderd by the actor who played Jekyll. Beside the things I mentioned I also did find some really good qualities about this recording. The Lady who played Emma did a much better job of exspessing the power of her songs. I must confess these concutions came about around 3 or 4 months after I bought it. So if you hate it at first keep and you will find, sooner or later, why it is not as bad as the first impressions."
1,The worst music to disgrace broadway in years.,"I bought this cd because it was highly recommended by a friend. Not only was it a waste of money, I am ashamed to say I own it. The cd contains the worst music on broadway today!! Shmaltzy pop ballads obviously written for composer Frank Wildhorn's wife's(who stars in the show)limited vocal range(No one knows who I am,Somone like you,A new life) and obvious ensemble pieces like'good and evil'are far too contempory for a musical set in 1885.Most of the actors and the ensemble have obvious American accents and even the actors who try for the correct accent sound overblown and silly.For heavens sake the musical is set in LONDON! Anyone who has read R.L Stevenson'Swonderful novella would scoff at this laughable attempt at an adaption.SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY AND BUY A REAL MUSICAL'S CD. OH, and I only gave 'Jekyll and Hyde' one star because you are not allowed to give none."
3,Be sure you know what this book is about first.,"In it's own right, this book is spectacular. The information is thorough and the pictures are considerably exceptional. Here's the thing. Don't be fooled by it's title. It most definitely is NOT an encyclopedia of fantasy creatures and the like. What it does detail on are movies, books, and other media that include such creatures. Personally I was looking for a book that details on the fantasy creatures themselves, and this book absolutely failed to do that. Look for another book to do that."
2,An Opinionated Encyclopedia?,"As much as I appreciated the general quality, layout and design of this publication, I was ""put-off"" by the very opinionated writing which I found throughout the book. When I read entries in ENCYCLOPEDIAS, I'm accustomed to INFORMATION, not OPINIONS. Oh well..."
5,"A book about 'theology in the raw""","Dunn opens this study of Paul's letter to the Galatians noting that this letter is not some ""academic treatise drawn up in the calm autumn of a long life"" but a cutting edge document articulating the theology of a new movement. Thus it is a letter that sings with urgency and passion. Dunn does a good job of capturing the historical circumstances that helped to foster St. Paul's passion. I was especially taken with the way Dunn identifies both the shared convictions and the points of dispute that existed between Paul and his opponents at Galatia. Paul, in Dunn's words, was doing ""theology in the raw"" as he both asserted the primacy of the cross of Jesus Christ and yet also maintained a hold on the roots of Judaism in the promise to Abraham."
2,Spring Step Flurry Black Winter Boot,"It feels good to walk in, but when standing they are quite uncomfortable. There is no soft inner soles. I had to buy gel for my heal and it's better, but still not comfortable for when someone stands a long time. I also don't recommend this shoe if you have a wide foot. It doesn't give much space."
5,Well Made,As with all products from Ten Point the quality and craftsmanship is assurd. Perfect fit looks good and works perfect. What more could you want.
2,"Great cause, but...","Musically, not really worth the price. One track we all have already, and the other-- well, it's Tori at her most wistful. While it is a bit interesting to hear her completely dismantle ""Silent All These Years,"" it won't leave your shelf again after you've heard it a few times. If your collection demands this recording, get it, but if it's real insight into her soul and her music that you want, you'd do better to put your money towards the price of a concert ticket, or a single with songs you haven't heard her do."
2,A wonderful song... but that's all.,"Sure, SATY is a great song and all, but.. that's all you're buying. No B-sides or anything. There are better singles out there. (the SATY import, for example.)"
4,3/2/1 Stars If You Don't Like Tori,"If liking Tori Amos is a sin, then most of us have committed the sin. If liking Tori Amos is uncool, then most of us are rather uncool. If liking Tori Amos is a guilty pleasure, then most of us have this common guilty pleasure. This song, (it was not a single at that time) first introduced me to Tori Amos, is important to me. The lyrics goes something like this:'Years go and I am still waiting for somebody else to understand', it perfectly illustrated my feeling at the age of 14. Definitely not perfect, this isn't her best song either, neither is this the best song on Little Earthquake, which could be her weakest album. Well, not big deal, you cynics! But to us, this is momentous."
3,A little disappointed,"I am a beginning songwriter and I bought this book thinking this would get the wheels turning, but I wasn't sure that the exercises in the book were going to give me a start in any real songs. My first impression of the exercises was that of a kindergarten class. One of the first ones has you talking in a foreign language that you made up to talk to a flying saucer that landed.I don't think I would use the material from the exercises to write a song that I would put on a radio station. That's just me. Perhaps someone else that has writer's block would find these helpful. I understand the process of writing the song, making it descriptive and telling stories with word pictures. The book does help you do that."
5,"Fun for seasoned songwriters, and a must read for beginners.","Having writers block? This book is filled with fantastic exercises to help get those creative juices flowing. If on the other hand, you are new to songwriting, this is a must read.. You'll get lots of great songwriting tips and tricks from this Berkley College of Music professor... without the tuition."
5,It's all in the title...,"This workbook reminds us songwriters - seasoned or newbies - that the art and craft of making up songs is supposed to be FUN! It's so easy to get caught up in rules, or structure, or ""shoulds,"" but at the end of the day, a great song is always more the result of lining up with your inner child, not your inner critic! I love this guide and offer it to students as well as keep it on the shelf in my studio. Thanks, Barbara L. Jordan!"
5,Love it,I bought to review the hologram scene and it met my needsI would recommend it to someone doing any research into that.
3,"Contemporary, but faithful, live performances from 1989","This CD contains songs recorded live from the Airplane reunion of 1989. These performances are exciting (hence the 3 stars), but I was deceived. I thought I was buying an early Jefferson Airplane performance based on the titles--consisting of mostly early songs. The CD I have of this is with a different cover (put out by Master Tone) and contains no information that these songs were recorded live in 1989. For the most part, the performances are faithful to the originals (if occassionally done at a faster tempo), but with one guitarist playing in a more contemporary style (playing well but in a manner that reminds me of Van Halen, so not quite fitting here imo) and, also, many of the titles have subtle horn accompaniment. Overall, an exciting sound if not quite what one would expect. Buy this is if you're interested in hearing these songs done in a more contemporary manner fitting of the 90s and thankfully not the 80s."
4,Great book!,"The seller was very efficient in getting out the book and it's in great condition, can't wait to read it!"
1,Disapointed,"This book says a lot about punishment ""there"" and as a Christian I don't think GOD is about punishment but LOVE and forgiveness, when we die we go to God because all our mistakes or sins we pay them here, on earth sooner or later is a fact, I believe in Karma, but here, not ""there""I felt really depressed when I read this book and make no sense with what others studies of the paranormal say"
5,The best book I've ever read!,"This book was given to me as a gift from a dear friend, and I could never thank her enough for being the one to introduce me to Kardec's work. Growing up with many questions and being afraid of death, his book made sense and gave me all the answers that I was looking for. As a practioner of his doctrine, I truly believe that we're here temporarily to learn and move on to other levels. His teachings about love, respect, compassion and unity shows us that the time has come for the human race to stop with the violence and help one another before it's too late. This book, and many others written by him, have showed me that there's a true meaning for everything on this world, and that we all have free will to change our lives and achieve self-actualization without hurting anyone around us. It is a must read to anyone who's doing soul searching or are seeking answers to their questions. kreva@aol.com"
5,The best book I've ever read,"Along with ""The Boy Who Saw True"", a book that I read straight through and then stayed right where I was to read straight through again (though in this case, I might not make it, I'm tired after staying up all night). This book forced me to make a conscious, ethical examination of my life. What could possibly be a more satisfactory experience than to know that my heart and mind were equally and actively engaged by the wonderful material presented in this book. I don't buy everything it states, but am comfortable that the greater majority of it is wholesome, laudable, sensible, consistent, intelligent, and worthwhile. This book has the potential to be life altering in only the best of ways."
5,"Wonder no more, here are your answers!","Consider all the tough questions that you asked your parents, a pastor, or a priest all your life. Consider that sometime, probably around your twenties you gave up on getting answers that made sense, answers that would ""feel right"". Like everyone else Allan Kardec had questions, many questions, and he had the opportunity to ask those who would certainly know. He then went about collecting and researching these answer like the scientist that he was, to be certain that he would not be fooled. The result was truly astounding. This book changed my life, removed unfounded fears, made sense! It explains life, our planet, our families, our responsibilities and our spiritual debts. I come back to it often, it is undoubtedly a once in a lifetime experience."
5,The truth is here !,If you think that you know everything that LIFE means you need read this book. The answers are clear and racional . It is proof that our existence here is something more than we can imagine...
5,The best Book i ever read,"If you're looking for answer about life, death, meaning of life, spirits, etc... this book is the one you got to have. I've always been intereted by the spiritism, this book is the reference."
5,The French diction 'bible' Singing in French!,"The book Singing in French has been my close friend for many years. In fact, I have just bought a new one since my first one fell apart from constant use! The information presented here is first-class with no detail left unattended. It remains (since 1979) THE major book on French diction for classical singers. Thomas Grubb explains everything in detail so clearly. He knows from experience what a singer's reaction will be and he is able to address that at the outset.Thomas Grubb is not only an expert on French diction, but also a wonderful pianist, vocal coach and an impeccable artist. This book is a must read! Grubb includes detailed repertoire for each category of voice. To singers, this is simply a French diction bible!"
4,"Pleasant, nostalgic stories.","This book of one-act plays was published in 1968, and I assume some of the plays were written even earlier than that. So they are stories from a bygone era -- a more innocent era. The language is dated (in one play, teens use the slang term ""Bazazz!""). I suspect today's high school students would resist putting on these plays, thinking them too square (or whatever the current equivalent of ""square"" is). But I found them pleasant to read, a reminder of a time when teens were not as cynical and world-weary as they are today."
3,Well thought out package but...,"I really wanted to like this package. It seamed to be very well thought out and included everything I wanted with my new portable DVD playerSony DVP-FX820 8-Inch Portable DVD Player, Black.PRO: good finish on the case, disk wallet included, 1-to-2 audio splitter built into case, 2 headphones includedCON: SMALL, no shoulder strap, can't mount behind a car seat (only between)Unfortunately, the CONs outweighed the PROs for me. The case was too small to fit the DVD player and power cable with all the accessories. Also, when full, it weighed enough that I wish it had a shoulder strap. If the case were a bit bigger (1 inch more depth) and had a shoulder strap then I think that it would be 4/5 or 5/5 stars. As it is, I had to return it.It not being able to mount to the back of a set was something that wasn't critical to me, but it may be important for you. Also the headphones are low quality but I didn't expect much from them."
3,"Well done nothing, no comedy, no action","This short (93 minutes) movie is like watching a bit of dull, depressing reality. The acting is very good, it's completely believable and realistic. However it's not funny, there is no action and unless you have a morbid desire to watch other people's depressing lives there isn't much point to watching this.It's enjoyable to see Dustin Hoffman's character take the downward spiral of his life and still muster up enough bravery to try a new romance and start a new life.Mostly it's nice to sit on your comfortable sofa and know that your life isn't as pitiful as the main characters in this movie."
2,Two of our finest actors continue with peak performances (5 stars),"This is a tremendous film, with two of our finest actors in peak performances. My rating SHOULD have been 5 STARS. Very touching, easy to connect with characters, beautifully photographed. Highly recommended,"
2,Predictable,"The actors were wonderful but the story was predictable and boring. I was really looking forward it because of the actors but was disappointed in the end result. Maybe I'm cynical tho because many people I know have said it's a ""must see""."
3,Just OK,"I love Emma Thompson. She's a fantastic actress. The big issues about this movie for me were the age difference between them and Hoffman's sort of unstable/creepy character. I kept thinking that Emma's character would be better off without him! (Not a good thought when the movie's intent is to show a romance between them.) It wasn't a complete train wreck, but not my favorite Emma Thompson movie."
3,Sweet movie!,This is not the greatest love story or the best movie that you'll have seen in a long time but it is a good movie and really sweet (without being too sugary). Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are what make this film good. Their acting and their chemistry are very believable.
5,A great movie about a true relationship,"This is a wonderful movie because of what it isn't. It isn't a formula movie. It isn't about two beautiful people falling in love. It isn't about perfect lives and perfect ""every afters."" Rather it is about how every day people can meet, connect and end up making a significant difference in each other lives. It is a movie about hope. Hope in the ability to repair relationships, hope in the possibility of meeting someone, hope in a better future, a better life than you are living today. I haven't enjoyed a romantic comedy this much in a long time."
3,"Okay, but a little creepy","Harvey starts following some Brit woman around. I guess the movie's supposed to be kind of sweet, but if you think about it, it's actually kind of creepy. It's one of those movie plots where, if you did this in real life, you'd get arrested or beaten with a tire iron.It's also uneven. When you get to the end, it feels like one-third of the plot is missing.Creepy!"
3,No my cup of tea,"The movie is just kinds of sad and middle-aged.The acting is very good by two of my favorites,but the plot is predictable: one gets the feeling that the movie was not made for the great merit of the script, but because it could get backing.That is gives hope to middle aged people alone andseemingly unwanted is probably a very good thing,but it has been done before.At best it is somewhat morbid and turgid and at worst somewhatuninteresting. Dustin Hoffman as Agatha Cristie's Hercule Poirot andEmma Thompson as Ariadne Oliver in a mystery would would have done them both a better grace."
1,A Story MUST have CONFLICT,"As stated, a story must have conflict or it just as well be a travelogue. Nothing is happening here. Two sad characters smile a lot at each other, but there is no acting. Why? Because there's no conflict. Sure, there are a couple of bumps in the road, but they are quickly resolved.Two great actors in a stinker of a movie.Go watch a pretty sunset."
4,Nice love story /comedy for the boomer generation...,"This is an extremely well acted and fun romantic comedy that we (my gal and I) enjoyed. I'm not sure its something we'd watch again,and the bonus features were slight and a bit going through the motions. If you are a fan of either of the stars then its a hit. If you like romantic comedies and are an adult I highly recommend it. I don't really want to spell out the story arc because that may spoil your fun , I'd rate it a great rental."
3,You're never too old for love.,"Last Chance Harvey is a sweet, tender film about two lonely people who forge an unlikely connection in a foreign land. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson have a very awkward chemistry but it seems to work for this kind of film. Hoffman's character is on his way to London for his daughter's wedding. He later meets Thompson's character who is desperate for love but can't seem to let go of her trust issues. The two fall for each other instantly and try to make their brief encounter long-lasting. Good film but kind of slow - it's a mixed bag for me."
1,Boring!!!!,"This movie was boring. If you're looking for a movie to put you to sleep, then this is it!"
1,Last Chance Harvey,"This movie's energy level was so low I almost fell asleep while watching it. Nothing really happened in it, and the chemistry between Hoffman and Thompson was not very believable. I felt like two great actors were squandered in the making of this flick."
4,For People that don't fit in . . .,"Well I loved this movie! People reviewing here said that they didn't buy that Emma Thompson's character is too attractive not to find a man - TOTALLY missing the point . . she just doesn't connect with most men and really doesn't want to even bother. And Dustin Hoffman - I think many men can relate to him as well - woman too. That feeling that in a whole room of people you just will never, ever 'get' the whole thing. You'd rather stay in your hotel room and read the phone book. The only thing I didn't agree with was when Dustin Hoffman gave the father of the bride speech (most of it was great!) and he said that he daughter turned out to be so lovely and kind, etc. even though she was from a broken home. IF she was so kind, why would she have her step-father walk her down the aisle? Yeah, I know, he wasn't a good father - but that was REALLY hitting below the belt - this from a sweet, kind daughter? But otherwise thought the film was a gem."
3,"3.5, Nice Movie","This was a cute movie. Nice, no sex, no cussing, no violence just an old fashioned older man meets lonely lady and they connect movie. I liked it. Definitely worth watching!"
1,It's a Rip Off,"What they don't tell you? Long time Reba fans already have this compilation, and MCA exposes the ruse themselves. Open the case of this 2 CD set and the CDs aren't named ""Love Collection Disc 1"" and ""Love Collection Disc 2"" like it implies by the back cover and track listing. No, inside the case, MCA has simply included ""Whoever's In New England"" and ""Sweet Sixteen"" - and, what's more? These are the same CD prints from those albums as they're sold individually, complete with original 1986 and 1989 copyright dates.If you don't have either of these albums, then perhaps this is a savings, but if you're a long time fan who already has both of these hit albums? Move on along, there's nothing new to see here."
1,TERRIBLE CONSUMER RIP OFF,These are 2 cds from the 80s. with copyrights on them from the 80s.. repacked by another label in what appears to be a new reba cd. DO NOT BUY. it is old old material. 20 year old cds in new wraps. A nightmare of a rip off
5,"Whirlwind Director II Direct Connect Box 1/4"" to XLR w/ground lift","We have used this item at dances and other functions to connect our DJ PC and mixer to a function hall's PROFESSIONAL sound system. My 1/4"" mixing board outputs are connected to the Whirlwind Director-II and the XLR outputs go directly into the facilities' stage input lines to their mixing board which feeds their amp and suspended professional speakers. We set their board volume and then control volume and mikes from my board. Great unit. No hum or noise of any kind. Don't go cheap - go with the best at Amazon prices."
3,Have to reset back to zero each time,"Everytime I use this scale, I have to reset it back to zero, which is annoying. Other than that, the weight it gives me is consistent, which is good."
2,Inaccurate and Hassle,"My last scale's battery lasted five years, I replaced the battery but it never worked after that. I bought this scale because there is no battery and liked it's eco-friendliness. But...this scale is inaccurate (compared to doctor's office scale), hard to read, and I have to readjust the pointer EVERY time I use it. It's a hassle and I still do not know how much I weigh. I am in the market for a new scale."
3,Bumbo tray,The tray in the picture is not ther same tray that I received. It must be a different model. It seems to work fine but not as secure as the one pictured. I am still happy with it for the most part.
1,Terrible Design,We bought this at Babies R Us and it is now in the recycle bin less than a month later. Save yourself the $10.
1,"I do not open, but this is why it gets a ONE STAR REVIEW...","HELLO?! Amazon? What is going on? How old, what weight/height should my child be PRIOR to using the seat? OR WHEN SHOULD MY CHILD NOT BE ALLOWED ON IT!? WHEN IT BREAKS AND SOMEHOW HARMS MY CHILD? HAVE THESE BEEN RECALLED?UNTIL FURTHER INFORMATION IS POSTED; Amazon, I am shaking my head in disgust and surprise..."
5,This tray is awesome!,"This tray is awesome!! I've been using the Bumbo seat for about 9 months now but I just recently bought the tray. I really wish I had purchased the tray from the beginning. It is so helpful. I have pretty much abandoned my daughters normal high chair and feed her in this. We love it so much!! When I first purchased it, I had a hard time getting it to stay together but I didn't have it pushed in tight enough. Once my husband came home (Mr. Engineer Extraordinaire), he noticed I didn't have it put together right. Ever since then, no problems. We use it constantly and it has never come apart - (unless we take it off). My husband is always critical of how products are designed poorly but he is impressed with this little tray."
3,"Functionally ok, but installing/attaching is a pain","Installing: Trying to insert the bottom tray piece into the tray itself was a major pain (I have two of these trays). I had to get my husband to put these together.Attaching: You attach the tray to the Bumbo with your kid already in the seat. It can be a little tricky because you need to make sure their arms/legs are out of the way so they don't get pinched.Functionality: My kids like the trays so they can lay their toys on there. We are not to the solid food stage yet, but, you can also use the try for feeding as well. At an early stage, its nice to use the seat without the tray so they can see their little toes.This is a cheap tray and its just hard to put together due to the plastic pieces, but it does the job. The tray is not real thick...so its not very bulky - which is a good thing."
1,Horrible!,This tray is horrible. It is hard to stick on the seat.The directions say not to lift the seat up when you are putting it on but there is no way to do that without lifting it! It is also a tight fit if your child is chubby. It presses against my sons stomach so we don't use it.
5,Will be great in a few months,"Unlike other reviewers, I found that the tray was very simple to attach - first curve the top ""clip"" around Bumbo middle and then push the bottom ""lip"" under the Bumbo bottom.Currently my baby is 3 months, so it is not very useful because he cannot really grab toys with control - however, in just a month or two this tray will be great.Pros:- Great idea, good for playtime and mealtime (when out)- Works well with Bumbo, good fit.Cons:- I thought I was going to break the plastic when snapping the pieces together"
1,not necessary,"I don't think it's essential but the one star is mainly because it's VERY hard to put the tray on and take it off while the baby is in it. Oh, and last, I saw this tray at wal-mart the next day for $10 and I spent $17 here (dumb me!)"
4,get's the job done,We bought this to turn our bumbo seat into a feeding station. We don't have a table so it made no sense for us to buy a high chair. This works great for us. We just sit on the floor with her and feed her.
3,Unnecessary Item For Us,"Returned this item after realizing that we really had no reason or need to ever use it. We mainly feed in the high chair, not the Bumbo, plus it also doesnt stay fastened to the seat very well."
3,Not needed,This is an okay product. My son was able to eat little snacks or play with his toys on the tray but it is hard to put on the Bumbo. You have to hook it on top and then somehow lift the BUmbo with your child inside to slide the bottom part underneath the Bumbo seat.
4,Rarely used,"I ordered this tray for my Bumbo chair thinking it would come in handy. My baby seemed to cry everytime I put him in the Bumbo especially when the tray was attached, like he was trapped or something. The tray is a little hard to get on and off while a baby is in the seat. For the very few times I actually used it, it seemed to work just fine."
4,This play tray is just okay.,"I got this so I could occasionally give my 7 month old a snack without taking her to the dining room and her ""big"" high chair. The problem is that the tray doesn't really lock onto the tray base so if your baby is wiggly at all (and they all are) he or she will be able to knock the tray top right off. I also have one of the slipcovers for my bumbo seat and it has to be taken off to put the tray on, although that really didn't bother me.Post Script:It has been about a month since I wrote this review and I have since discovered the two pieces that comprise the tray do in fact snap together. This improves the quality of the product a fair amount.I still feel it is rather flimsy and not big enough for meals or most toys...but at least it doesn't fall apart every time I use it.It comes in handy a few times a week, which is all you can ask for sometimes..."
2,"Love the idea of it, but doesn't stay","I would love to use this thing, but it does not stay secured. I put it together first and installed it just as the directions showed, but it just doesn't seem to fit properly. I don't believe I installed it incorrectly but I won't give up on it because I love the convenience of the Bumbo!"
4,Tricky but Useful,"This tray is very useful and I am glad I made the purchase. When I attach it to my Bumbo, it stays put. However, putting it on with a squirming baby can be tricky. You have to be sure not to pinch those chubby baby legs, and you have to lift the seat up off the ground a few degrees to get it on. This would worry me if my baby was big enough to slip out, but luckily she isn't. The tray itself is not very wide, so it won't fit a standard suction plate, like the Sugarbooger brand. At it's widest from baby's chest out, it is 6 1/4 inches within the raised edges. I wish I would have known this before I purchased a plate, but otherwise, I am happy with the tray."
4,Its okay,It is an alright try i hate how it attaches its a little unsafe when your child is in the seat and you have to attach it that way...unless you child is a skinny mini then thats the only option of attachment you have. Fast shipping ong the up side
1,Love the Bumbo - the tray is pretty useless,"Like other reviews of this tray, I love the Bumbo seat itself, it's just this tray that leaves a lot to be desired. My 4 month old grandson was able to dislodge the tray the first time it was used. There's just no way to secure the tray. Big dissapointment."
4,Great product! A little hard to get off.,"I bought this tray to go with my daughter's Bumbo, and I love that I can put a couple of toys on it and she can grab them and play with them (she is just shy of 4 months old). The tray will be great for feeding too, when the time comes.My only complaint (and reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the instructions say to always remove the tray before taking your child out of the Bumbo, but it is very difficult to get off when the Bumbo is sitting flat. You have to tilt the Bumbo backward and pop it off from the bottom and sometimes it kind of ""jolts"" the baby when you do this. I will still continue to use and love this product, but it is a little annoying. I've just decided that it is easier to ignore the instructions and just ease my baby's legs out of the slots without taking the tray off (which if you are halfway intelligent you can do safely)."
3,"great concept, not quite as useful","this tray is a great idea in theory, however, once your baby starts to move around and push things out of the way, this tray is useless. I made the mistake in purchasing this once my daughter was approx. 7 months old. At this point I wasn't able to use it. It comes off the bumbo relatively easily, so she knocked it off each time."
2,Not worth the money,"I agree, this product is not worth the money. It is hard to get onto the seat at times and is easily pulled off. When I finally get the tray onto the seat, I like the fact that it provides a surface for toys but you can easily enjoy your bumbo seat without it."
4,works,"Attaches to the bumbo seat and does work. Our child didn't really like the bumbo so we haven't used it much. The tray is made of decent quality plastic. Would buy again for another baby, I know some love the bumbo and the tray would be a good added bonus."
3,A bit tricky,"The tray is attached to the bumbo after the baby is seated, but because the buttom latch goes under the bottom edge of the bumbo, it's pretty tricky to get it on and off."
3,Not so sturdy,My son was able to pull the table top off at 4 months...it defeated the purpose. Might not work if you have very curious and active infants.
2,I don't get it!,Ok someone tell me what all the fuss is about. This tray is good for one thing- setting toys on it. You don't need it for feeding since any babies in this are too little to feed themselves. It is a pain to get on and off and you need 2 hands to do it. We all know having to use 2 hands to do something is a pain when you have the baby on your hip! You can't leave it on when you get baby in and out of the bumbo. I just don't get it- don't spend money on this.
2,Cheapie Tray!,"Man Bumbo, I'd be willing to pay an extra five bucks for a QUALITY tray. The one you're selling now is JUNK!The tray would be PERFECT if it stayed put and was easy to attach. My 4.5 month old can easily take the top of the tray off. I read somewhere that the top of the tray snaps into place if you work with it, but I haven't found this to be true.Great idea, just needs to be improved."
1,Table sent was not what was shown,The table sent to me was actually a different version than what is pictured. I had one like I was sent this time before that broke very easily so I was thinking I would be getting something different since the picture was different. The table I was sent was clear and has a plastic piece that attaches to the bottom of the table and helps connect it to the seat. This piece is very easy to break or misplace since it doesn't really attach well. Also I could have bought the clear one that I was sent for $5 less from Babies R Us.
1,Useless,"I want to first say that my daughter and myself LOVE the Bumbo. Everyone should have one for their child!We had also purchased the Bumbo Play Tray and it is USELESS! My seven month old was able to pull it off and it would not secure in place. What's the point of a tray if your child can take it off? At first I was thinking, ""well, maybe I didn't properly install it"" but after my husband looked it over, we still had the same problems. I'm very disappointed with the Bumbo Play Tray."
2,Not Worth the Money,"This tray is a good idea in theory, but if your child is like mine, they will be able to easily remove the tray. It does not lock into place."
3,Table Is Awkward,The table is a very good idea however the design is kind of awkward to put on. The baby has to be in the seat before the table is put on but to actually slide the table on you have to tip the baby back because there is a lip that goes under the chair.
5,Must have for the Bumbo!,If you have a Bumbo and love it then you definitely have to get the tray! its great for learning to self feed and especially if you have two kids and not two high chairs... you can put your little one in the Bumbo and toddler in the high chair and they both can eat independently!! Its great to have your hands free to do other stuff being a SAHM.
2,Not functional,"Not only is it very hard to attach, it doesn't stay put. At times it feels dangerous to use. I am afraid my child will lean on it and it will fall off."
2,Difficult to Attach,"Let me first say that I love the Bumbo seat design. However, because of the design, you have to put your baby in the seat before you can attach the tray. (Or at least I do in order to get his legs in the holes) I find that the tray is very difficult to attach, especially with a baby in the seat. You have to tilt the seat back a little to get enough tension to snap the seat on. I'm always afraid I'll lose my grip and he'll go tumbling backwards.Also, the first time I put the tray on, my little guy's arm got caught under the tray. The squishy material of the Bumbo helped cushion his arm, so he didn't scream his head off when it happened. While I like the Bumbo, I'm less enthused about the tray."
4,Easy to clean and doesn't pinch baby,I got this to see if getting a high chair was needed at the time. My daughter is breast fed so she didn't need one right away. I got this tray to ease her into the transition of eating off a spoon and we both loved it. It didn't pinch her when putting it on and it was obviously easy to clean. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars was because it's really snug so kind of difficult to lock onto the bottom on the Bumbo. Otherwise I love it!!!
5,Wonderful Addition to the Bumbo!,"I just bought this product today and it is very useful! My baby has been sitting in his bumbo but has a hard time holding onto objects. This is where the tray comes in. If you read the EASY instructions and attach it to the seat, and then put your baby in, he will be distracted for hours and can play with toys on the tray. You can also feed him on this tray."
2,Not an option for a baby who doesn't want to stay in the seat.,"My baby never stayed in his Bumbo seat for more than a minute. So I purchased the tray hoping to prevent him from getting out. Yes, baby gets locked in well, however, instead of climb out from front, the whole thing flip to the side. Risk of getting baby hurt is even much higher now. Waste of effort for me."
2,Poor design,"The first tray I received was defective; the base piece was warped to the point that it didn't fit into the tray. Amazon responded quickly, sending a replacement by FedEx overnight. Unfortunately, the plastic below the slot on the second tray cracked when I attempted to push the base into it. I've used the second tray anyway and have had no trouble securing the tray to the seat. I'm unhappy with the product, but it's not worth the hassle of returning another one, especially since there's little chance the third one would be any better made."
3,Too difficult to put on and take off!,"I bought this tray after I got a bumbo (which is great btw) as a gift for my son. The problem is it is way too difficult to put this tray on and take it off. You are supposed to get the bottom of the tray hooked onto the bottom of the bumbo but it requires you to stretch the tray a little so it will fit under. Needless to say when you have a squirmy baby in the bumbo it makes the task much harder. The bumbo is great for your 4 month old to start sitting up. But if your child can sit up I recommendFisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat, Red/Whitefor mealtimes. It attaches to a regular chair which makes it easier to feed your baby as you sit in a chair next him. Your technically only supposed to use the bumbo at ground level; so, I would sit on the floor with him or put him in the bumbo on the table and watch him like a hawk for fear he would flip himself. The bumbo is great, but use a highchair or booster chair for mealtime."
3,Barely used,"By the time I got this play tray, my LO barely will sit in the bumbo anymore. Now that I'm over the 4 month old stage, I wouldn' t buy either item (the bumbo or the tray) for my baby. Waste of money. I use the boppy pillow to help support my supported sitter. Even now that my baby sits unassisted I will still put the boppy behind him just in case he falls back. Once babies turn around 4 or 5 months, they'll start twisting out of the bumbo and find the tray confining. I maybe used this item 10 times."
4,Good addition for the bumbo but...,I'm glad that this tray is available for the bumbo. I wish the bumbo would just come with it. The only thing I don't like about it is that you have to have the tray on the bumbo before putting your baby in the bumbo. This makes it harder to get your baby in and out of the bumbo.
2,Works at first and then the cheap tab breaks!,I first got it and used it a few times. It was perfect for my son and he loves it. Then one day the tray pops off. Then I try and put it on again and 2 min later it is off again. The plastic under the open tab broke and it will not secure in place. They need to make it better. I even tried to superglue it. It did not work. Maybe if I superglued it at the begining... But then there is a safety issue. I just hope they make a better one soon!!!
4,"Okay, once it's on","The tray is very handy once it's on. However, I can't get my 5mos old in the bumbo with the tray already on, which means that I have to put the tray on after he's sitting in the bumbo. This is difficult because he's a big guy and I have to try to lift the bottom of the bumbo up and tip it back in order to get the tray support wrapped around the bottom."
2,"Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory",Didn't use the try much... but we loved the Bumbo for our son between 3 months - 6 months... great and handy to use.
2,Not really useful,"I bought this tray because I have a bumbo seat. It is quite difficult to put in and take out the tray from the seat. I only use a few times, not value to buy this product."
2,Useful but makes leg holes too small,"We use this tray for our four month old's toys to keep him busy in his Bumbo seat, and in that regard it has been useful. However, the tray makes the leg holes pretty small, making it difficult and awkward to put the baby in the seat and even more difficult to lift him out. His legs usually get caught on the tray. Since you must snap the tray in place before putting the child in the seat and cannot safely remove it while a baby is sitting in the seat, we have had no other option that to struggle with it, or not use it at all."
2,bumbo tray,This tray works.....but it is really hard to put on and take off when the baby is in the chair.
4,Great addition to Bumbo,I really like this because I can stick a suction bottom toy on it and keep her busy for a while. Otherwise she will just drop the toy and be unable to reach it. It is awkward hooking it to the bottom of the seat to secure it but it is fine once its on. Definitely worth the price.
2,somewhat alright,I purchased this product since my daughter would repeatedly throw her toys on the ground and then cry. I hoped this would help keep this from happening. However the sides of the tray do not go as far back as I had hoped and she continues to throw her toys onto the ground. I would've been better saving my money and getting a high chair.
5,Fits Bumbo nicely,"Easy to put on and off, tight and secure, good amount of space on tray. Easy to clean, helps stabilize baby. It is ivory which I was surprised to see on the box but it looks good. I like it"
3,Bumbo Seat Play Tray,"This is a useful accessory for the Bumbo Seat, however, it is somewhat difficult to attach and unattach from the seat."
3,A teacher's perspective,"I've used Bumbos in my infant classrooms and at my nanny jobs, and I love the seats, but I'm not so impressed by the play trays. They are awkward to put on and take off compared to other brands. They do run through the commercial dishwasher well, though."
3,just okay,The tray is usable but don't try to put the bottom part under the Bumbo! It is impossible to do with the baby in the Bumbo and can't imagine how I would get it off!! I still use the tray by just placing it on the top part and since my grandson is only 4 months old - he can't figure out how to take it off anyway. Tray still functions to hold his toys which is why I bought it in the first place.!
5,Great Stuff,"Loved the AOA x-over in print. Very handy to have it on my Note 2. Can't wait for parts 3 & 4. Only drawback, thought books 1&2 should have been switched. Over all, very pleased."
2,Great stories except...,...the kindle edition has pages out of order. VERY VERY frustrating. I'll be sticking with other ways to do digital comics.
2,I don't get it...,"I'm having trouble getting this series... Why is the title called the complete age of apocalypse series. Yet there are books 1,2,3,4, etc... I have the gold covered books of the age of apocaplypse released long ago... will I be buying the same thing if i considered these compilations?"
3,x-men age apocalypse,it is not the best x-men but if you have time you should pick it you and read it.
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this book on the verge of the birth of our second child and was SO DISAPPOINTED. The long and short of it is that the book tells you that there is no ideal spacing between children (there are pros and cons of any space you chose) and that you will handle things just fine. It provides (weak) validation that you'll do ok, and get used to things, but simply presents very common-sense type ways your life will change. I bought the book despite the very outdated pictures on the cover, since I could find very little else as a guideline to what was a scary and impending change for us, but the book did not help with time management skills, suggestions of how to get out of the house better/faster, ways you can implement changes in your routine to accommodate two - etc. All in all, a no-help."
1,Worst Case Scenario,This book is utterly awful. It is filled with fear mongering of the very worst kind. Reading this book made me feel terrible about even thinking about having a second child. The thesis appears to be that having another child will ruin your first born's life. I was weeping by the end of the book and felt utterly terrible.
3,Leaves out important issue of first born Nursing Toddler,We have a zealous nursing toddler and are having a terrible time weaning her. I am very concerned about jealousy over nursing! I was hoping to find information about how to approach weaning the first born and the best way to handle explaining that the baby nurses and the first born no longer does! This book assumes no nursing after year one -- certainly missing a major trend.
4,Better than the Meg Zweiback book,"My first son will be 14 1/2 months old when his little brother is born and I can't seem to find much advice on how to prepare us all for this. I got a lot more out of this than the Meg Zweiback book though. If you are having a second baby when your first child is 3 or over you will get even more out of this book. However, this book is not only for how to prepare in advance for your growing family. It has a lot of usefull information in it which I'm betting I will come to rely on as the boys are growing up. It presents scenarios that are sure to come up as your children get older and gives advice on how to deal with them. All in all, a pretty good book for addressing concerns you may already have and preparing you for some you probably haven't thought of yet."
5,This book is a BLESSING!!!!!,"This book is a total blessing! I'm so happy that I ordered this book before the birth of my second child. I feel so well informed of what to expect from my first born when baby #2 comes home. Every mother should have this book before the birth of their second baby. In closing, I'm glad this book continues into the first year of the sibilings lives together!"
1,Very Negative,"I have never written a review on Amazon, but after reading this book I strongly felt that it was needed. I was very disappointed with how negative this book was written. It was overly dramatic and made out that your life was going to be in constant turmoil once your second child arrived. In general, most children have some problems adjusting to a new sibling but very few, I believe, suffer as miserably as this book would have you believe."
2,Would not recommend this book,"We are expecting our second child, and I was looking for some helpful tips and reassurance that things won't be totally horrible and unmanageable. I certainly didn't get that from this book! A friend of mine put it best: ""I think you accidentally bought 'Why NOT to have a second baby'. You need to read the book 'WHY to have a second baby.'""I'm about halfway through ""Beyond One"" and it's much better."
4,ED WOOD,I owned this movie back in the early 90s in VHS format. The DVD quality is so much better. Ed Wood had a sense for the mysterious. In my opinion this movie has some historical meaning. It is NOT pornography!
1,"Eddie, This Movie Is So Bad It Is Not So Good","Edward D. Wood, Jr. (PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, GLEN OR GLENDA?, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER) wrote this bizarre porno about a couple who get in a car accident. Criswell (NIGHT OF THE GHOULS, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE) stars in this as a ghost who sees gets pleasure out of women dancing naked. I need to mention also, these women are not that hot. I am sorry Eddie, but your other movies are more appealing and you were trying harder, this movie is not so good. Sorry A.C. Stephens for you making this piece of crap, I know you needed work. 1 out of 5 star rating."
1,This is one Orgy I will avoid,"Boy was this bad, worse than Plan 9..2 teenagers watch people dance in various segments, some topless. A cheap exploitation film with really no story, a silly werewolf. I really saw no point or plot in the movie, just people (ladies) dancing really,padded out for over 1 hour. Watching partially to topless nude women dance around for an entire movie might be entertaining to some, but not to me. Really a waste of time unless you like films like this. I like B movies and some sleazy stuff, but this just doesn't have a thing going for it.The DVD transfer might be great, but that alone doesn't make a movie any better..okay, it is better than Manos, the Hands of Fate, that is about it."
2,Poor plot with poor acting,"I REALLY WANTED TO SEE THIS SINCE IT WAS AN ED WOOD MOVIE. I THOUGHT IT WAS RATHER ODD THE FIRST COUPLE OF MINUTES. WITH POOR DAY LIGHT TO NIGHT TIME INTERPRETATIONS, ORGY OF THE DEAD WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE LOWER FILMS ON THE LIST. IT HAS VERY POOR SCRIPT WRITING AND IT WAS SIMPLY DULL. YES THERE IS NUDITY BUT IT GETS OLD AS THE MOVIE DRAGS ON. IT WAS A VERY SLOW MOVING MOVIE. I REALLY WOULD CONSIDER TO PASS THIS ONE UP, HOWEVER IF YOU STILL HAVE THE SLIGHTEST POINT OF INTEREST GO AHEAD AND RENT IT."
1,Don't waste your time on this peice of home video trash,"Yes, there is nudity. The whole movie is a bunch of women dancing around in their underwear with no top. The point is to give the head vampire plaesure. Poorly done and completely pointless. (Refering to the color version)"
1,seriously what the hell is this crap,i bought this movie thought it would be horrble it was. So it was really nothing to get mad about. But this is deffinately one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I would not even recommend this to give to someone u hate. There is only one good point to this movie it is full of a bunch of topless naked chicks. This peice of crap also has a talkin mummy whoo hoo. So all in all i would deffinately give this movie no stars if i could.
2,Things That Go Bump And Grind In The Night,"Although most Ed Wood films are so ridiculously bad they achieve a certain weird charm and make for an amusing 90 minutes, this Wood-scripted film isn't one of them. When a horror-writer and his lady love have an auto wreck en route to a cemetary for literary inspiration, they encounter... a bunch of topless bimbos bumping and grinding amidst the tombstones!There is no story per se, the majority of the film being devoted to the questionable charms of the lady phantoms, few of whom are more than apathetic at best. But it's perfect for a Halloween party... Just turn down the sound and put on some decent music, add a few drinks, and giggle away."
2,Ed Wood's nudie classic,"This review is based on the VHS version. A couple crashes on a tropical island and stumbles across a bizarre ceremony presided over by Ed Wood favorites Criswell and Vampira (or at least a facsimile of her). Various topless girls appear before him and are required to dance as atonement for various sins. It turns out that the voyeuristic couple were killed in their plane crash and the woman has to strip and dance for Criswell, too. No plot and no sex, just topless dancing girls. Very odd film. I gave it two stars because it's typical Ed Wood fare (low budget, poor acting and cheesy dialogue), but I'm an EW fan. If you're not, don't bother with this film."
4,Orgy-riffic!!!,"Though this is not much of a movie (more of a strip show with a slight concept), I love it and so will you if you like nekkid chicks. Favorites are the golden girl and the feather girl. The bride is downright hilarious, probably the funniest thing that I've ever seen in a movie. Disapointment: Ghoulita never gets nekkid."
2,"A must see for fans of Ed Wood, others stay away.","A writer and his fiance is driving to a cemetary in the middle of the night so he can get inspiration for his books (this is probably the worst day-for-night scene I have ever seen). He crashes with the car and the couple have to spend the night at the cemetary where the Emperor of the Dead (Criswell) and Princess of Darkness is hosting a topless dance show. This is a very boring film, but the few acting scenes between the dances are as cheesy and funny as you expect from a film by Ed Wood. The ""erotic"" dances are very innocent and embarrasingly silly, but fun for the first 5 minutes. I can't recommend this film to anyone except for those who wanna se all films of Ed Wood..."
3,expert opinion,"Zeal costs money. I have been searching for all of the available (and unavailable) books on landscape lighting. The word ""landscape"" in this book's title triggered my purchase. This is a book about structure lighting: the commercial exterior lighting of building and large public spaces. Indeed, there are a few small scale projects discussed but these are commercial also (a flagpole/sculpture application and ""electric sheep"" site-specific art. My focus is narrow; my niche is small. I am seeking books about residential low voltage outdoor (""landscape"") lighting. This book, like the ""Outdoor Lighting Pattern Book"" and others of its ilk, is about big time architectural lighting. When I make purchasing errors like this I place them with my architect wife's reference books. I'm not dissing the book; it is quite interesting and offers a close look at what was the current state-of-the-art circa 1993. Books like this have a shorter half-life than the latest computer."
2,Can get better skirts at this price,"I brought this skirt for my wife, and she ended up very disappointed. In her opinion its not worth 17$. You should be able to get better skirts for less price from Kohl's or Mervyns."
5,A Must Have,This book is a must have for the intermediate Dreamweaver user. The tutorials are extremely easy to follow but show you how to do some of the coolest DHTML on the web. All of the DHTML tricks are supported in the most popular browsers. I have been enlightened.
4,Dreamweaver Magic,"The content, design/lay out, and graphics are a magical five star rating in my book! That said, the reason I rated the book 4 stars and the reason I wrote this note is that I would advise people to go to the PVII web site and print out the errata page(s). While improving my trouble shooting skills, the omissions and errors left me scratching my head a few times. The precise, cutting edge and constantly evolving nature of the medium are exquisitely expressed in this book, and that's precisely why this book needed one more final ""proof"" read. Bottom line, this book has taught me more about clean (coded) web design than anything else I have read. I'm looking forward to Al Sparber and crew's next iteration. I recommend this book highly!"
4,Menus and Navigation Bars,"Dreamweaver 4 Magic AUTHOR: Al Sparber PUBLISHER: New Riders REVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: Dreamweaver 4 Magic focuses mainly on Menus and Interfaces with seven of the twelve chapters being on navigation or menus of one kind or another. The other five chapters cover CSS DHMTL, Motion, Rollovers and templates and library objects.A CD-ROM is included to help work through the information with a 4-page Table of Contents and a 7-page index to help look up specific items. The print is on the small side but the graphics are in color. The information is laid out in an easy-to-follow format.This book is not one I would pick as my first choice for a Dreamweaver reference but it certain would be useful if you needed navigation help in your webs. If the authors expand on the five chapters without the menus and navigation, Dreamweaver 4 Magic would become a magical book to have in your library."
3,Not for beginners,"I have very little experience with designing Web pages and limited experience with HTML/DHTML. I was looking for a book that would give me a good background in Web design in general, in using Dreamweaver, and show me how to do cool stuff. I realized very quickly that this book shows you how to do cool stuff only. It is more a recipe book then a teaching tool. I will come back to this book after accomplishing my two first goals."
2,It's not THAT great!,I consider my self an intermediate web designer and I am having some trouble with this book. First of all the text and images are too small and I have good eye sight. After following along with the projects I'm not really learning much with all the pre- designed objects and designs. I feel like a robot following the books orders. I can't picture myself doing much of this stuff on my own. So far I don't know how customizable some of this stuff is. The finished products are awesome and I would like to use some of these ideas on my site but acheiving that will probably take more than this book.
3,Focus on popup menus is outdated,"With the introduction of Macromedia's Fireworks 4 there are a lot easier ways to create popup menus that those described in this book. Since popups are on of the main ""magic"" features, I think the book is outdated now."
1,Dreamweaver 4 Magic,"Unfortunately, I found this book just a rehash of other author's original concepts. Mr. Sparber is apparently too busy inflating his own macromedia dev. exchange ratings to dedicate quality time to authoring useful material. Besides unintelligible grammar and poor editing, this publication offers nothing new and exciting. Pass."
4,"Solid, lively basic introduction -- important reading!","This is a solid, basic introduction to a little-considered area of American history and contemporary life, the relationships among Native Americans and Black Americans. This is a solid piece of work, well researched and well written. Although the series is designed for younger readers, this work is intellectually respectable (and engaging) for adults interested in making an initial exploration of the topic. The author is breaking some relatively new ground in exploring the implications of race, color, and ethnicity (as well as social class) and the blending of races and ethnicities in contemporary culture. The format/design engages the eye, and the pictures are well-chosen and ""worth a thousand words."" I recommend it highly. (4 stars rather than five, only because it is a simple introduction, rather than a full-blown study.)"
1,Good for a year..,"Monitor worked well for the first 9 months I had it then a couple of power issues that were more annoying than anything. At about 15 months the screen went blank and no longer displayed anything, a few calls to Westinghouse and they determined after their ""rock solid"" 1 year warranty it becomes a giant paper weight. A couple authorized repiar shops won't even look at it as parts are hard to get from Westinghouse. I would never buy from Westinghouse again without an extended warranty!"
5,Delicious Times a Hundred,"At last! A cookbook that guides you on how to feed a small army with style, and still have enough energy left to actually enjoy your own party. The dishes are delicious (especially love the spicy scallops), the recipes are easy to follow, and the results go beyond expectation. The professionalism of the two authors, and their sympathy for what a home chef faces, is apparent. I highly recommend this book, and am personally giving it to my entertaining friends for a holiday gift."
4,Great Study Aid,"The New American Standard Strongs Exhaustive Concordance is an invaluable tool in doing any serious Bible study. The dictionary at the back of the book leaves allot to be desired however, so I use the Vine's Expository Dictionary which is also keyed to the Strong's numbering system. With this concordance you can find any passage, any reference quick and easy."
1,veggies only,"This is a pro vegetarian book. The author talked a lot about the evils of animal fats, but he didn't really encourage an very balanced diet. I would not buy this book again, it was not helpful and contained no new information about nutrition."
2,"Kindle version - ok for notes, virtually useless for tabs","The rating is for the Kindle edition...I would have purchased the paperback if I had known the Kindle version compressed the tab labels so badly that they cannot be read. Unfortunately, the download sample does not give you much in the way of music, just text, so there is no way of knowing this before you actually buy. The selection and arrangements are very good, but avoid the Kindle edition if you are attempting to read the tabs from a reasonable distance and play."
3,"Kindel version is OK, but probaby better getting the book","I picked up the kindel version mainly, because I like to read sheet music from my ipad. Mostly I read very clear pdf files, but this book was scanned poorly for kindel. Some of the tabulature notes are hard to read, and as a matter of fact even if i use my imac to view the kindel desktop version its still blurry. It required me to zoom in try to figure out the notes, then just memorize that part. Otherwise the book itself has some really fun easy to play songs. ...and the guy who wrote it seems like an interesting fellow. His bio reads as he is a real outdoor adventurer. 3 stars for the less than perfect display of the music notes in kindel, other wise for the content a 4 or 5 star book for me."
5,Great fitness video,"I really enjoyed this DVD. The whole concept of nude yoga is pretty cool. It's a great way to get comfortable with your body while keeping it healthy. The video is very nicely shot and everything is explained very clearly. Aaron and his student are all very warm and friendly, not snooty body elitists.Bottom line: This is a great looking video, the guys are very attractive and the yoga is challenging but achievable."
3,Death Is in the Air,I like Kate Kingsbury. She is an easy and entertaining read. She is one of my new favorites and one I will look for.
3,Death is in the Air,"Mystery is very easily solved and it was a bit tiresome to have all the characters use the same phrases (`I reckon"" ""Yanks"") over and over. But overall an acceptable addition to the series."
1,This movie does not even deserve 1 star.,"First off, the only reason I gave it a star is because that was the lowest I could give it. This is the probably the worst movie out of every movie out there. Sure the title may make it sound like it is violent, but it is like the Walt Disney version of horror movies. This movie is not even worth the $3.50 I paid to rent it. Movies like this should be banned. If you want to really waste your money and/or see why I hate this movie than I suggest you go and rent it first. And I promise you that you WON'T like it. This movie is about as bad as Linda Tripp's looks or Monica Lewinsky's cholesterol level."
2,Just OK for me,"I honestly wasn't a big fan of this book...it has some common sense information, but other than that, it just wasn't helpful for me. Perhaps it just wasn't what I was looking for."
5,Excellent for kids of all ages,This is a great addition to any child's library. It's packed with pictures and simple definitions. It give enough information to be very helpful but not so much detail for one word that the child's eye's glaze over! The most amazing thing to me is the number of times that my daughter has picked it up for casual reading! The pictures are that engaging!This dictionary is a great value and a wonderful tool.
3,HEAVY book!,"We were looking for a picture dictionary with a picture for each word on the page. With the size of this volume they could have easily left out some words and illustrated each entry. So, if you are looking for a dictionary with pictures for every entry, this is not going to satisfy you.This dictionary is a BIG, HEAVY book! You won't be tossing it into a back pack and using as you go around town. It is truly ""dictionary-sized"" and probably weighs 10 lbs.That said, it is a nice book.We are sending it back due to it not being useful to US. But if you're looking for a nice children's dictionary, this one will do quite nicely."
4,Amazing Amazon!,"great book; I purchased it for one of my students. Thicker and more complete than I expected. Parents were pleased. I noticed that the price changed from my first to second visit. Overall, I was pleased with the purchase!L.B. Jr."
2,What is the point?,"I bought this for my 8 and 6 year-old children. We have tried to use it about a dozen times and only found one or two of the words we were looking for. I've realized that, by now, if there is a word they don't know, then it's probably not in this dictionary."
2,MW Children's Dictionary,"By the time your children are old enough to be looking up spellings and definitions by themselves, they will find far too many words they search are not included. Any child in 3rd grade or up needs a more comprehensive dictionary. Lots of pretty, big, colorful pictures, but they come at the expense of words. I can't recommend it; my kids outgrew it by age 8.(Sample of words not included in this dictionary: amplitude, beguile, crass, drivel, endive, frumpy, guttersnipe.)"
4,Dictionary Review,"This is a very nice children's dictionary. I bought it for my daughter who is in second grade, and it has been great. It has a lot of pictures, easy to read font and color-coded section guide that makes it easy for a kid to look up words. I will have to say though, that it is not very complete; it did not contain 'tibia' which was one of my daughter's second grade spelling words. Overall, we are very satisfied with this dictionary."
3,okay could use more words,missing some words my 2nd graders came across. Some definitions are limited. Should provide the whole range of meaning for words.
4,Good book but ...,"This was a good book for referencing however, I had one problem. For my daughter's homework assignments, I needed a listing of synonyms and antonyms for words in the dictionary. There were none and I had to go to the online dictionary for help. Which I found right away on some dictionary websites. Other than that, it was a good book."
2,Many words left out,"This dictionary has lots of pretty pictures but I'm surprised by how many words are not included. Words as commonly used as ""Japan"" were not included."
1,Merriam-Webster Children's Dictionary,"I agree completely with the one star review by Tom. This volume is a piece of junk. We purchased it as a gift for our granddaughter and it didn't last a week. It fell off her bed onto a carpeted floor and the binding broke completely. Since it was made in China, it's not too surprising. If a publisher is going to sell a large heavy reference book aimed at children, they should make the binding heavy-duty for expected hard use. From what the other reviewers said about the dictionary's content, I guess we didn't miss much. Next time we buy a book like this, we'll try to check where it is made first.In summary, don't buy this dictionary for a child since it's content is inadequate and its binding is junk."
1,Merriam-Webster Children's Dictionary,"The Merriam-Webster Children's Dictionary is junk. The binding ripped within 24 hours of use and it was not mistreated. It is published by a brand-name publisher but assembled and printed in China. Apparently the Chinese use inferior quality materials. A dictionary binding has to be strong enough to withstand continuous use. In this case it didn't even last more than 24 hours!! I suggest checking the manufacturing location before purchasing reference books or ones that will be opened and closed frequently, to determine where they are printed and assembled. This may be difficult or impossible on-line because this information is not disclosed in the item description."
2,Christian parents beware,"Christian parents should know that this dictionary has only a generic, small case listing for ""god"" while listing ""Allah"" as a specific entity. I don't have a problem with ""Allah"" being listed that way, but I believe that ""God"" should also be recognized with a specific, capital-letter listing. Most other dictionaries, Scholastic for example, do it that way (i.e. ""God"" is the god of Christians and Jews.) I also noticed in some of DK's science books that evolution is stated as a fact, while some other books, like Osburne, state that ""most scientists agree... [about the idea of evolution]."""
5,Great book,"Wonderful design and excellent graphics. It was bought as a gift, and the gift recipient loved it (she still does)."
4,All inclusive.,The dictionary is a little big but all inclusive. It is great to have at home. The dictionary includes great pictures and sentences that my kids understand. I would recommend this product.
5,Merriam-Webster Childrens Dictionary,Excellent Product: We needed a dictionary for my 2nd grader to use. He needed to look up words and write definitions in his own words. He has been using the dictionary with success for a few weeks now. This is an excellent and clearly written and illustrated dictionary for kids.
4,Home school resource,"We use this book for our home school. Any student would benefit for years with this product. It has excellent language, format, pictures, and extra info for students as young as 6 and for many growing years. It makes learning to use a dictionary easy and fun. It imparts info in a way that children can understand and grow with it. We use it for a home school so it gets a lot of use. I must have resources with as much application as possible. This one is irreplaceable."
3,"ok, but not great","I get frustrated when (1) spelling words my kids have don't show up in a dictionary, and (2) the root word or the word itself is used as part of the definition. Very frustrating! I teach my kids they can't do that! I'm sorry to say that a name like Merriam-Webster has instances of both of these. I'm switching brands."
5,great dicitionary for kids,"if your looking for a family dictionary, this is probally the one your looking for. Im not sure homw many different aditions theirs out, but any of them over the year 2000 are probally accurate. theirs alot of pictures in this dictionary, and the pictures and words are organized very well. theirs alot of words too."
4,I want one for adults!,"We bought this for our ten year-old son to try and make looking up words a little more fun. It worked! The photographs and the imagery help make the hunt for the word and its eventual discovery more of an adventure than drudgery. (We always seem to linger on the dinosaurs no matter what the word we're searching for...) True, not all words are to be found in this edition, but far more than our last children's dictionary. (4 Stars for the missing words.)"
5,great tool for children,"Great dictionary! Wonderful pictures, easy for our 7 year old to use! Our 4 year old also enjoys looking at the pictures."
5,Wonderful!,It's wonderful! I love it! All of them arrived on time and the quality is perfect! I will definitely recommend others to use it!
4,Revolving Words,"I initially bought this dictionary for my Grandchildren. It answers some of the many questions asked by my 6 and 10 year old Grands. I would have rated it a 5, but feel that a bit more explanation should have been provided for some words.Nevertheless, I find my two Grands picking it up on their own. I am ordering more of them as gifts to family members who have discovered it on my kitchen counter and took an interest in it for their children.Recommended!!RND"
3,Decent information - Poor Quality on Binding,"Decent enough content, nice pictures and descriptions....However the binding broke within a month of normal usage."
5,Merriam Webster Children's Dictionary,"I found this book to be very informative. The pictures only reinforced the word that was being looked up! It has everything and then some!! My son really enjoys reading this dictionary. I wish we had something like this when I was coming up. Every parent should have one for their child!None of the pages were missing in our book, and I am thankful, to miss any information would be disappointing."
5,Excellent,This is an excellent dictionary for the kids. Colourful outside and inside page attract kids more. Very easy to ready.
2,college primer,I felt this book was specifically for a college level early childhood development class. I even recommeneded it to our precollege child development class. It was not a parent guide.
4,Perfect size for my large hamster,"Vegetable oil stopped the squeeking. My hampster LOVES this pet wheel. He is on it for hours every night. Now that I have oiled it, it no longer wakes me up at night!! :)"
1,Wouldn't Recommend It,"I hate this wheel. I have this wheel because the pet store in my town didn't have any other type of wheel. This wheel is so noisy and wobbly you can hear it when you take it out of your room. The wiring is safe for hamster feet and it is cheap, but if you don't want sleepless nights...Don't buy it!"
3,I like this wheel,"I've bred Gerbils for more than 15 years and have experience with lots of products that have come and gone and I love this wheel, its just hard to find in stores. Its rust proof which I like the most. Plus there are no feet or tail injuries, as the mesh is very good on the gerbil's feet/tail. I use electrical zip ties to attach it to the screen lid of the aquarium cage. I also use smaller ones for mice which attach nicely to the mouse's wire cage. Thereby at night when the wheel makes the noise, you can 1) turn the lid upside down thereby removing the wheel from use at night. OR 2) safely spray the attachments with Pam Cooking Oil, which is safe if the gerbil licks it and eliminated the squeaky wheel."
4,Pretty good product,The charm itself was slightly smaller then expected but for the price it was fine. Shipping time was good.
3,Seems long? Read it! It's worth it.,"Ok, some people thinks this is a boring book, which you can fall asleep in, while others enjoy this. I think it's sort of both. Lyddie was an very tough-very confident character, on the other hand she cared about her family too, especially her younger sis. But she is a lil bit too ""care-y"" about her $$$.This book is mainly about how a gurl survives in the old time REAL WORLD, how she made it on her own, and how others helped her and loved her and how she helped others and helped herself.The boring part is that she WORRIES WAY TOO MUCH!!! BUT, what's not boring is that she's an independent woman.To some peeps, ""we can still hop"" was a lil (no comment) but to others it's funny.Katherine P., I think, spent a lot of time thinking about this, to make it seem real while fictional.HOPE THIS ACTUALLY MADE SENSE TO YOU, BUT AH-WELL.....CYL!"
4,Lyddie's struggle,"This book is about a 13-year-old girl who tries to keep her family together by working at a mill in Lowell, Massachusetts. I had to read this book for a school project and it was quite a long book to read. By reading this book I learned quite a lot about the 1800's and about how hard some children had to work back then."
5,Lyddie,Lyddie is a great book for all ages! Lyddie is a great young chiild who must fight for her family and friends for those of you who haven't read Lyddie READ IT!
4,This book was very emotional.,"I like the way Katherine Paterson captured my attention at the beginning of the book and held me in suspense through the whole book until the last page.There were a lot of good and interesting parts in the book and my favourite part was when Rachel came to live with Lyddie. I like that part the best because it had a lot of emotions and there was always something new happening to Lyddie.I thought the characters were really well thought out and I liked Lyddie the best as the book was written from her pespective.The life like traumatic adventures and happenings really gave the book a solemn and serious position and I kept reading to find out what happened next.The book always caught my emotions and even when my mother read the chapter when Lyddie's mother died, she cried as she read.The emotion I always felt was sadness. I felt sad for poor Lyddie losing so much of her family and her life. If I was her, I would have given up hope a long time ago."
4,Read the book 'Lyddie' it is sooo interesting.,"This book was one of the best written books I have ever read.There are not many books like this in the world.It is very sad that here family had to be seperated.Read this book, it will make your heart melt"
3,My My My.....,"Well, It wasnt HORRIBLE, but it wasn't one of the wonderful books I have read, it was OKAY. I would reccomend reading it if you were studying about it...not for anything else"
3,One of Many Books I've Read,"Lyddie, a young girl who survives by herself. She use to live at a farm with her family. But one day her mother decided to go away because of the debts, her mother sent Lyddie to work at a tavern and her brother Charlie to work at Bakers' Mill. But Lyddie was dismissed from the tavern and she headed of to Lowell, Massachusetts to work as a ""factory girl"". She was the overseer's ""prize girl"" but one day the overseer tried to kiss her and she fought back and that's when the connection broke. She made friends with people at the factory such as this girl name Diana Goss and Brigid. Diana wanted people to sign the petition for better working standards, but Lyddie didn't sign it because she needed the money to pay back the debts so she can go home. But to her surprise her uncle decided to sell the farm, and all her hopes were gone. Brigid was an Irish girl. Lyddie helped her to work at the factory. And you can find out the end."
4,Just How Much Can One Girl Take?,"Lyddie, a young girl, has to cope with the fact that her mother is going crazy and that her two little sisters are going (with their mother) to live at an aunt and uncle's house. She and her younger brother Charles do well alone, though, but their farm is in debt and the family has no money to pay for it. So both she and Charles are rented out to different families and places to try to make ends meet. Lyddie is barely earning anything, though, and she desperately wants her family to be reunited in their beloved farm. So she becomes a mill girl and has to live with the hardships of sickness, speeding machines, deaths, and her own worries."
3,Lyddie,"Lyddie, written by Catherine Patterson was a well-written book by an excellent author, but if you like happy fairy tales this is not the book for you. This is a historical fiction novel about a girl who is working in a factory, in order to raise money to help keep her family together. Her factory life is horrible yet she struggles onward in order to save her family. You get caught up in wanting to help her through. Somehow she works it out yet there is never complete happiness within her. I personally did not like this book very much because of the sadness and disappointments in Lyddie's life. It was a very well written book as a whole though. If you enjoy historically accurate and heartfelt novels, I suggest you read this book."
2,Lyddie is okay,"Lyddie is not the best book I have read. It is pretty boring and honestly I would not have read it if I hadn't been forced to read it for school. Basically, it is about a thirteen year old girl named Lyddie who is forced to work in a factory and become a mill girl to pay off debt. Throughout many deaths and being harassed by Mr. Marsden, her boss, she improves her grammer with the help of Diana and encounters Irish Immigrants. One in particular, Brigid, is just like Lyddie when she first arrived at the factory.I hated the ending. I do not recommened this book to other readers. Although, if you are interested in mill life, factories or womans rights, you might enjoy it."
2,A very slow-paced Novel,"I personaly did not like this book. My class had to read this book and almost nobody like it. My class and I didn't like it because it was very slow and repetitive and wasn't very intresting. I did give Lyddie an extra star because you do learn a lot about early Lowell when you read it, but a better way to learn about Lowell is to actually go there. My class went on a feild trip their and we had a blast!!!!"
2,I was forced to read this book for school,"I was assigned this book to read over a span of three days, which proved simple as the book is no thicker than a magazine. The uncaptivating and predictable story line seemed even acceptable compared to the unrealistic characters. I concieved Lyddie, who values money more than her family and is too afraid to stand up for what she believes in for the sake of a paycheck, as entirely fictional. ""We can still hop"" that Catherine Patterson comes up with a better novel."
1,Lyddie,The book I read was about a girl whose parents left and told her take care of her brothers and sisters. Their parents send them to live with separate families. I thought the book was a little boring .I recommend it to younger readers.
1,This bag is a fake!,Please research the brand and know what to look for when you buy designer bags. This one pictured is a fake. Louis Vuitton did not make this bag and does not hang any tags from the bag like this. The speedy does not have any pockets on the side either.
1,Very Bad Sound Quality,"I have many of these sides on other CD's where the sound quality is excellent. This 2 CD set has a very bad transfer. The songs are all in dead Mono, with no fidelity to speak of. You could do better to just buy any of the RCA compilations that are available here."
2,"Deconstructionism is very difficult to, um, deconstruct.","Deconstructionism is a method of literary criticism that has been extended to arts and architecture, whereby you turn in on the text itself to find new forms not bounded by the old structure and show the inherent silliness and instability of a seemingly concrete structure. Sounds fun.I like words: I like shaping them like clay, molding, bending, folding, and twisting them. What can I get with this juxtaposition; that rhyme; an entendre? I had hoped for something (wasn't sure what, perhaps a better tool for playing with words -- but really a new tool to analyze politics, architecture, history, life, propaganda,. . . . . . but that'd be just a ""Structuralist"" denouement?). eeeh. Though a cartoon-esque graphic rich format was clever and convivial, I found myself racing through the last one-third of this book begging it'd end. . . . . Was it me, authors Collins and Selina, the 99%, or Derrida who'd failed?"""
1,weak,This rather impoverished account spends insufficienttime with each topic to provide tractionfor the reader. Apart from the first section thewhole thing was a big disappointment.
2,tweezers for contacts,I suppose it would work great on daily throw away contacts. I had to squeeze them toomuch and had some scratches as a result. My contacts are for one month.
1,Not Useful.,"There is nothing ""soft"" about this tweezer. I could not use this at all (maybe to put an eye out). A total waste of money."
2,$6.95 SHIPPING ????,"I'VE OWED ONE OF THESE AND LOVED IT. WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THIS BUT $6.95 FOR ""STANDARD"" SHIPPING IS WAY TOO MUCH FOR AN ITEM THIS SMALL. I JUST PURCHASED A 4 PACK DVD SET AND SHIPPING WAS $2.98 !!!!"
5,What a treasure!,"This book was such a delightful find for me. This book is the first children's book I've found about my husband's relative, Charles Blondin, and I bought it as a surprise for him. I've found several other books about Mr. Blondin, but this was just so unique and the illustrations are invaluable.This book has become a true treasure to my family and will stay in our family forever. Thank you to the wonderful bookseller who got this book to me in record time. The book is in surprisingly good condition considering it had been obviously read many, many times. There were even some notes written in pencil on some of the pages which we found charming."
2,gum balls,I The balls were too hard. Could these have been old??? gum balls Seems like they should be fresh. They look great but hard to chew
3,Satisfied but not excited,This product as far as taste...about what you would expect. It lasts about 12 seconds. But I have the gumball machine mainly for looks. The jar comes not completely full..unlike the picture. This will only fill half of the gumbalk machine. You might want to order two jars.
1,Save your money!,"Just bought this exact tub for $7.24 at my local Walmart. Don't be fooled into paying double just for the ""convenience""."
