1,Crap,"JP slowly went down hill after the seventies and this album shows that they had failed tp keep up with the Metaliccas of the later genre. The tracks on this CD like Painkiller and All Guns Blazing are just laughable. If you are into stupid songs with silly play as fast as you can riffs by old rockers then buy this. If you want to hear some decent Priest, go back 10 years."
4,metal meltdown,A breath of fresh air. Some very heavy licks. As good as the soundtrack of F- Zero. Probably ripped off by F-Zero. Something to listen to when you're tired of mtv.
5,This drink is awesome,I had the Minneola tangerine flavor and oh man! What great taste. This is 100% juice and a little fizz and GREAT tangerine flavor. Its just like biting into a real tangerine... amazing. The wife adds some nice champagne and we have ourselves a great mamosa. Check it!
2,Uncomfortable,I bought these shoes last summer - they are really cute but not comfortable because of manmade materials they are made (not breathable at all). After reading previous rewiew - I had the same - the tips and heels started to fray. Like the design but not how they made - uncomfortable.
3,Plumb Good,"I have an old ""Standard"" toilet that has a flange around the bottom of the overflow tube, and the flapper valve mount could not slide far enough down the overflow tube for the flap to lay flat enough to seal. I used a Dremel to cut off part of the mounting ring on the flapper valve and was eventually able to use it, but you couldn't depend on it to seal correctly. In a couple of days I bought a new one at Wal-Mart and it worked. No problem with the shutoff valve though."
5,perfect! Took less then 2 minutes to install!,"My toilet started running and I couldn't get it to stop so I decided the refill valve was broken. I looked around and found some in all the price ranges and finally settled on this one for around $10.My current valve stem was in good shape so I didn't have to replace the refill tube, just the top valve piece. I was able to undo the lock washer on the valve and lift off the old one, then slide the new one on, relocked the washer down and put on the little plastic water tube. I also changed out the flapper and in less then 2 minutes my repair was done and the toilet was no longer running.This setup worked perfect for me.I did remove the flapper from the mount it came with and reused my old mount, I also didn't use the refill stem so my repair was easy, but that made this deal that much better!"
5,"Easy to install, good quality","I found this very easy to install - everything needed (except for the tools -- you'll need pliers and a couple of rags) was included in the package, along with clear instructions. The valve height is easily adjustable so it will fit into pretty much any tank. All the parts seem to be of good quality that will (hopefully) last several years. Quiet operation."
4,This solved my problem completely!,"I'm a younger adult, who other than changing a toilet flapper every few years, had no idea how to repair a toilet. Well, my older(probably from the 70's when the house was built) toilet started running into the issue of filling up extremely slow. I did online research and found out that one of the solutions could be replacing the entire fill valve.Well, Fluidmaster's name kept coming up and I found it at my local hardware store. I decided to just do a complete repair job, so I purchased this kit(flapper included), as well as a new vinyl water line, as my original one looked past it's prime.Needless to say, after some fumbling with adjusting the shank on the new valve, everything was replaced, and not only does the toilet bowl fill up super fast again, but the flush is more powerful.I enjoy learning DIY stuff, as I'm a young adult who will eventually move on his own, so this was a helpful learning experience."
1,Lasts about 9-12 months,"I have a few of these installed in my house. Very easy to install, but starts leaking after 9-12 months and your water bill skyrockets. There should be laws against these because they are a huge waste of water if you don't closely monitor them."
5,Problem solved,"Had a leaky toilet valve that wouldn't stop. Replaced it with the fluidmaster 400C toilet tank repair kit and the leak stopped. Used the new flapper plug too, which was not seating as a perfect seal without mucking about with the handle. Purchased a small tube of silicone grease (aka, vacuum grease/plumber grease) and slathered it on the flange of the flapper and now it seats and functions perfectly. Instructions and extra adapter parts made the work straightforward enough for a fast DIY fix. Make sure to bleed the new valve as instructions require, I had to repeat this several times."
4,ONE FLUSH DELIGHT,IT WORKS. SAVES WATER. EASY TO INSTALL. I BOUGHT 2. JUST WHAT I EXPECTED (AND NEEDED). I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE OLD STYLE FLOAT BALL SETUP.
4,Exactly what I needed,"I used this kit to replace an antiquated toilet tank valve, balloon float and flapper. I did have a little trouble coming up with a good way to attach the new flapper chain to the outdated flush lever, but I eventually clipped the chain to itself through a hole in the lever."
2,Works fine for a year or two - and then gets stuck...,"I thought humans had perfected toilets a long time ago but apparently not. I have only two toilets in my house and it seems like every year or two I have to replace one of these fill/shutoff assemblies.The problem is that the float sticks after a while and then it won't shut the water off properly.I have well water and after a while there accumulates a dark orange ""gunk"" in the water. Perhaps that's to blame. Maybe it builds up on the float or the rod that the float rides on?In any case, a lot of people in this country have well water and there should be a solution out there that works for us folks.Years ago I remember toilets that had ball valves that were on a metal rod. They never seemed to go wrong. Maybe it's because I wasn't the one who had to fix them? In any case, I wish I could find something that lasted a bit longer."
3,bad out of the box,"My old one lasted 9 years, but the new one was bad out of the box. It wouldn't shut off even when I pulled the float lever up. Ok, I'm not mad at them, but, I went out and bought a magna flush brand(04-4059) which has a much easier shank adjust and the same float adjust, you never get wet adjusting it. sorry fluidmaster"
1,Holy piece of junk!,I tried to replace my old apparatus with this thing and I could not get it to work. The directions are horrible. I could not get it to shut off and eventually I gave up. It seems cheaply made and flimsy.
4,Works Great,"Replaced with other brands and never worked more then one week, Installed new one was easy and is working great"
5,Expect Sunshine by Betty L. Bush,"Expect Sunshine grabbed my attention from the moment I started reading. It is one of those books that I could barely put down for long at the time. This book provides much insight into the struggles related to farming, particularly the plight of the African American farmer in earlier times. The story certainly is worthy of a sequel! When I finished the last page, I was dabbing my eyes with tissue. Great book!!!!"
5,I expected and got sunshine!!!,"I love reading a book or seeing a movie and finding out why a writer gave a certain work a title. Well ""Expect Sunshine"" is a wonderful title and one that I even find myself saying to start my day. It is like I hit bingo, when I finally discover where the title comes from. Of course I can't give that information to anyone without spoiling the book so ......Here's my review .....I thoroughly got my sunshine reading this wonderful book by Betty Bush. The characters were well developed and interesting. I could relate to the characters and got completely involved in their lives. There are so many interesting stories in this one book without being overly complex. The book is a great read and I highly recommend it. Bookclubs would love this one. It is just the book for great discussions!"
5,An African American Classic,Expect Sunshine is a ray of hope for those in search of quality writing. Don't pick this book up if you have some where to go. You will not want to put it down.
5,Great to use with a shower chair for elderly mother,"This air pillow worked perfectly for my mothers bath chair. It helps positioning her in the chair, she doesn't lean back so far; its comfortable and very functional."
4,serves the purpose,you don't need much air in this at all. I barely put anything in it. when you put it behind your back it fills out from the pressure of sitting back on it. it fills in the gap from you to what you are sitting in. I use it in my car when driving and it does help.
5,What a relief!!!!,This is the best relief I ever got for my lower back pain. I have one for my house and one in the car. I recommend it highly!
4,Helpful,"I'm a nurse, and I'm on my feet all the time. I'm also always boosting patients up in bed and doing other things that aren't so nice on my back. I use this in my car, and it seems to relieve some of my back pain. Like other reviewers have said, keep the pillow barely inflated."
3,Improvement needed,"It really does help, but... Firstly, it tends to flop all over when one moves, and require frequent readjustments: because the strap is elastic, the pillow is not firmly attached where it is needed. Inflation also varies with temperature and requires adjustments. Maybe the worst part for me is that, using it at home, I don't wear heavy clothes: my lighter clothing soon gets soaked with perspiration where it gets in contact with the pillow, even when I don't feel particularly hot."
4,Back pillow,"I have a herniated disc and was in a lot of pain, especially sitting for long periods of time. Before I was to go on a long road trip, I asked my physical therapist if she knew of anything I could do to be more comfortable on the trip.She suggested this pillow. I tried to find it locally because my trip was coming up soon! But all the shops nearby seemed to be out of stock. I had enough time that I would probably receive it from Amazon, so I ordered online. And I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this came.My therapist emphasized that the pillow shouldn't be used (in my case) fully blown up, but very floppy. So I blew it up and smooshed it down. It helped a great deal."
5,BEST PILLO EVER,"THIS PILLO IS AMAZING, I USE IT EVERYWHERE AND IT GIVES AMAZING BACK SUPPORT. BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO MY BACK !!"
2,Worked great.,The only gripe is the strapping option to the executive leather chair. It could have been done better... I have to keep adjusting everytime I sit down on my chair. Other than that it worked well. I would NOT consider buying the inflatable type next time though.Updated Feb/2012================The air now started leaking. I only used it tied to a leather chair with casual use. Lowered the star rating to TWO stars now because of this. I didn't expect it to last forever but just about eight months is NOT good enough.
1,price should have told me something,"Ok...if it's toooo cheap, forget it. One end broke first time use, the other forked end is too large and thick to adequately get in to engage the pin in order to remove the band from the watch. Was this a china rip off...yes. Who can I blame...myself, no one else."
4,"Not a professional's tool, but excellent for amateurs","Up front, this is not the tool for a professional watchmaker. There are better tools for each function this tool performs, but for an amateur that only does these things occasionally, this one works well enough.It has a pin for removing bracelet links on one end, a small claw for removing the spring bars on the other, and a small inch/mm scale in the middle. And they work well enough. This and a small jewelers screwdriver to remove springbars from watched with bracelets with do most of the things an amateur would do with straps and bracelets on watches.*Read the directions before using this tool, damage to watches is your own fault (but amusing when you should have known better).*E.M. Van Court"
4,New Labour wins,"An insider's guide to Tony Blair and his colleagues' revolutionary overhaul of the British political system. With an insider's view of British politics, Gould perfects what so few of his contemporaries could achieve with their broadbrush generalisations from the media and outside new Labour.Alongside Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson, Gould helped make Labour electable for the first time in a generation. Having seen Britain's improved relations with both America and the European Union since then, the world can safely say it has been a positive experience.A classic"
5,Helps with clotting,"I've always been a ""bleeder"" so I tried this to see if it would help. It definitely has. My blood clots noticeably more quickly now. And the price is about as good as I've seen. However, since this does improve clotting, make sure that's something you need. Make sure you aren't going to be getting too much with whatever other sources of K-1 you may be ingesting. Don't use this if it may cause unwanted blood clots. When I told my doctor I was supplementing vitamin K-1, he game me a concerned ""Why?"" But I'm very pleased with what it's done for me. I've probably been using it for about 7 or 8 months."
3,You get what you pay for.,"As far as cheap aprons go, this is a good product for the light duty handyman. I was not crazy about the strap design. The strap has to be put through two metal loops, and then tied behind our back. But the price was affordable."
2,"Spock's Brain is not good, Beauty is good!","Lots of Star Trek Original DVDs to buy-but be forewarned! Spock's Brain is a dud--even though it has a classic guest star question--""Brain, brain, what is brain?"" Answer: It is what you stole from Spock after stunning the Enterpise crew!!!! Speaking of Spock, he turns into a remote control TV and manages to guide Dr McCoy through Brain Surgery--and Spock has no brain!!!!!! This episode insults Spock's character. As Trekkies say, ""Bad Star Trek is still pretty good."" Maybe--it is, at least, slightly campy. Luckily, you have another episode on the DVD, ""Beauty"" is a good examination of prejudice based on looks-- a subject that is still taboo in our society. If you are one of the few Dr. Pulaski (Next Gen, season 2) fans, she does a good acting job in this episode. The Medusa is an interesting character. My other gripe is that Star Trek Originals do NOT give any extras-commentary from an actor would help these DVDs sell. You get 2 episodes and that is all!"
2,One Episode Not Worth Mentioning and Another Average One!,"If you are deciding which volumes to keep, you can safely consign this one to the dustbin and not miss a thing. Granted the second episode is a lot better than the first but still relative to the other episodes in TOS-dom, it is still forgettable. The other reviewers have done a good job of explaining why the first episode is brainless but the scriptwriting of the second episode is also subpar and while the plot is a little more interesting and believable, the overall episode still falls short of what we are used to from prior episodes. Definitely not recommended!"
1,One good One Bad,"While I agree that Spock's Brain is not the best effort of the third season, I would rather sit through this episode than ""Plato's Stepchildren"" or ""The Way to Eden"" or ""The Mark of Gideon"". I think these three should have been scrapped before they were aired in 1968-69.""Is There In Truth No Beauty"" has always been one of my favorite episodes since I was a kid. It would be interesting to bring the Medusans back in a future episode to test their great navigational skills. Lots of sequel potential here."
3,i like Spock's Brain,"I like Spock's Brain. i dont care what others say! As for 2 shows on the DVD... thats almost 2 hours. At best you could put 4 shows ... maybe with out losing image quality. You can't put 8 hours without losing image quality. I also think the price is fair for 2 shows. the image quality could have been a little better, that's why I gave it a 3 star rating. but the image quality is not to bad."
3,field guide it is not,although format size emmulates field guide this book is just ordinary. It would profit from better sketches or even picture. the topic is great this one let me down.
3,Sturdy but difficult to get baby out,"This baby carrier is sturdy but can be difficult to get the baby out when you're done using it. Biggest complaint is that when the baby is very little and facing toward you, there are plastic fixtures which can rub against his/her face. I had to put a small towel in between the baby and the carrier to keep the baby's face from hitting the hard plastic. Not an issue when facing outward."
2,Angela barnes,"It's a ok book if you are good in math, otherwise find something else. My class found it very difficult to understand. The arrangement of the book is difficult to understand."
3,okay,"This is a good math review book--but for my needs, it doesn't include enough of the very basic math skills that are a prerequisite to these lessons. I tutor students who are preparing for the GED and this book is great for an advanced student."
4,Good,"This is a very good book. It's step by step and it just makes things simple. I've always had a problem with math, and this book really helped me through that. For the first time, I actually understood fractions! I'm taking my GED test soon, and I'm confident I'll do good thanks to this book!"
1,Horrible layout,"I am a teacher and private tutor, and I bought this book (and The Algebra Tutor) for reference during my tutoring sessions. Both of the books contained a lot of general information, but were extremely difficult to navigate through. The problems and answers were not worded in an easily understandable manner, and the layout of the ""chapters,"" problems, and even index were confusing. Your school textbook is easier to understand! It looks like someone typed the entire book on an old typewriter. Both of my books will be donated to my school library, as I have found no help in them. Please buy something else!"
1,GEOMETERY TUTOR NIGHTMARE,"If you want to learn more about high school geometry, do not buy this book. It has a bad layout and will definitely confuse you more than helping you understand geometry. This book is a nightmare which will intimidate you from even looking at geometry again. The rating on this book is really a ""0"" but I had to put a ""1 star"" because it did not go lower than this rating. Please do not waste your time buying this book."
4,helpful and inexpensive,"Compact, inexpensive and easy to use - this bookhas it all and it's been field tested successfullyon a number of occasions. It covers everything intwo dimensions and even has a chapter on solid geometry.The format is particularly attractive making it possibleto open the book to any page and dive right in. Thestatement of each problem is highlighted and every sectionclearly labeled which makes navigating the book trouble free.In addition, the authors often give two proofs for a problem -the first an informal presentation giving the motivation andplan of attack - to be followed by the formal two column proof.A student can read most of this alone and could read it coverto cover with the help of any competent tutor."
3,Much less Les,"The song ""With These Hands"" is not included. While the other tunes are good, it is an Ok album without it."
4,happy birdie,this is one of only two foods my cockatoo will eat and petsmart no longer carries this one so was very glad when i found it reasonably priced on amazon. thanks.
4,"If you have to do a science project, this book is the best","This is not just a science book it is also a history book. You get to match your mind against the mind of the great inventors. You see how to make a thermometer, an igloo or a geodeisic dome. For some reason, science projects are supposed to be a sign that you are smart. Most of them are really dumb. This book has some cool ideas so that even if you have to wrap Play Dough around straws to show tectonic plates, at least it feels real because these are reconstructions of real inventions that people made and that changed the world."
5,Genius book for (potential) genius kids,"The great inventions of the world were all born out of problems that needed solving. This book inspires budding inventor kids (the ones who hoard bits of string, cardboard and plastic) by telling the actual history of common inventions, and then giving kids simple instructions on how to duplicate them and, best of all, improve upon them. Combines history, science and problem-solving into one easy-to-read book for budding Edisons, Einsteins and Jobs-es. My ten year old daughter just spent the morning duplicating the Catapult experiment (using a plastic spoon, wooden skewers, a rubber band and a ball of paper (sitting in for the recommended marshmallow)."
4,relax with bing,"I very much enjoyed this tape which is a sampling of some of Bing's best TV performances including several of his best songs. My one proviso is that, although I enjoyed the commentaries by Bing's wife, daughter, Michael Feinstein, and Andy Williams, I wish they could have been made background or extra. After having once seen them, I wish it were possible to just listen to the performances. Still, a wonderful DVD."
4,GOOD SECOND COMING!!,"This actually is a good album.Adinas vocals have improved and she actually can sing.Surprisingle evry song is not about freaking or having sex.She does a good job at singing songs about others topics.The first single ""Nasty Grind"" was a good debut back to the music world.The song ""T Shirt & Panties"" is still godd after all these years...sounds a bit out-dated..it was originally supposed to be on her second album (Welcome II Fantasy Island) which mysteriously never came out.The first three songs are all good.this album shows she is a good versatile singer and thats what we need these days no longer does she need to always say she is a freak..WE GET THE POINT!.NOTEWORTHY TRACKS:Missing YOuThat ManButtnakedNasty Grindthats How I RollGood job to do it alone this is an independenat release..Buy the album you wont be disappointed..OVERALL GRADE 89/100 = B+"
2,This woman needs Jesus,"Adina Howard - The Second Coming (Rufftown, 2004)I actually liked Adina's first album, Do You Wanna Ride?, back in 1995. It's nine years later and she's kicking the same vibe; something's wrong here. Not to mention the album cover itself and the inserts where you can see her nipples in one picture. The songs are full of tired sex clichés, generic club productions and sleepy ballads. The only good songs are ""Crank Me Up"" with former Elektra lablemate Missy Elliott and ""T-Shirt and Panties"", which is old as hell (from 1997's shelved Welcome to Fantasy Island). Who told Adina to come back anyway? We have enough sex kittens in R&B; that took her place after she became a one-hit wonder (see Beyoncé, Kelis, etc.). Don't even borrow this album. -EJR"
1,Same old rehash trash!,"This Is exactly the same garbage that was put on the last cd.I can't believe that It took this long(between records) for this. I want to know what Is all the fush Is about.I agree with the last reviewer that anybody can put this kind of stuff out,It's when you show growth that you stand out.She has talent but this material will most likey stunt her growth as artist.I really don't think you have to be nasty to sell records unless you are lacking In talent. I belive maybe she can be better If she reinvent's herself on her next cd."
4,Love this album! Funky in some parts!,"I love this album and its sexiness! I was very pleased that Adina Howard got this album out, though she had to get a record label in Reno, Nevada, of all places, to release it. It is decidedly adult and explicit, but Adina can do this kind of R&B so very well. The first song is funky as well as the next two. Then the album shifts to a series of strong and sexy ballads. This album is like the female version of R. Kelly's 12-Play album of 1993. Liked the offering with Missy Elliott. The last song which she dedicated to the troops overseas is very touching and moving. It was a smart move on her part, even if she's known for a shocking image. Howard is back in a big way, and this album proves it!!!!"
4,Play over and over and over and....,"After a long hiatus (9 years in the states)Adina Howard is back! I decided to buy the CD because I remembered how much fun the DO YOU WANNA RIDE disc was in '95. I was NOT DISSAPPOINTED, it has the slow jams and some uptempo tracks. I enjoyed playing it over and over. The only disappointment will be that she will not get the airplay nor recognition for a good album when everything else sounds the same. BUY IT (FOR MATURE LISTNERS)!!!"
4,she back!! shes Great!!1,"Adina is back after years away with her fans like me egerly awaiting any music from her. Ive been a big adina howard fan from day 1 and she made another great C.D.The differenc between this cd and her 1st one is that this one contains a little bit more more uptemo songs ,they are decent to me.They put 2 old songs on it form her unreleased 2nd album. The songs are t-shirt and panites and crank me up.But the best thing is her slow songs wich is her specailty.They come on at the end and they wont dissappoint you.I like songs#9 wich is duet with her a some new r&b singer, and lets roll. But this is overall a good cd and I hope it gets the air play it deserves."
5,Adina's still the freakiest,1 Nasty Grind 2 Butt Naked 3 Don't Wait Up 4 That Man 5 Wannabe These are my top 5 choices but the whole album is tight. Get it!
4,Adina is back!,"I took the time to really listen to this album and was happily surprised. If you are looking for a really nice, slow groove, funky kind of record, then this is for you. Adina demonstrates a lot of growth and maturity on this album (unlike the child who wrote the immaturish review listed earlier) and it is reflected in her voice and song selection. I have played this cd for several of my friends without telling them the artist and they all were shocked when they learned it was Adina. I purchased three copies of this cd; one for the car, one for the stereo and one for my girl. My advice, listen to it in the store and form your own opinion - - you'll be surprised. Adina, do your thang and never mind the haters."
3,Beautiful,Bought this as a gift for my boss. I work at a vet clinic. She absolutely loved it. It was a little bent which depressed me but I can't complain too much for the price.
2,By something else if you can afford it.,Poor power plug= gets lose by barely touching itMac OS X PowerPC laptop cannot boot via firewire from this external HD.Poor customer service.
1,ARRRGGGHHH,"I've used this drive for about a year as my primary back-up. I turned it off along with the rest of my computer for a two week period when I would be out of town. Returned to a completely dead drive. No power. Will not start up.A one year old drive, designed to be a backup drive, fails.This is my last Western Digital drive."
1,Channeled Info - That should sumamarize it...,"I found little or no background on how they came about this information, other than it being ""Channeled"" information. This is where all the red flags went straight up. Though it is possible to get important information from channeling the other side, it is rare at best. It is subject to many of the individual's thoughts. Knowing the background of the person, you see familiar patterns of thought. All of this book could have easily come from the mind of these 2 people.I read the first few chapters actually thinking this was the word of St. Germain, and was impressed. It lined up with many current esoteric thoughts and the whole mainstream ""woo woo"" community. It did actually resonate with me until about page 25 or so. Then it became obvious this was just pandering to the reader and that this book was not real at all.Will the real St. Germain stand up and be heard?"
5,Excellent,I read this book about 20 years ago however I was not ready to hear the profound truths within. It is fantastic and very relevant to NOW
1,A disappointment,"This book is not for me, but I can't justify saying that it's not for everyone. I will conclude, however, that only hardcore Christians will be able to practice this system and not feel foolish due to the outdated and ridiculous philosophies. The majority of this book deals with handing your life over to God, letting God take over your Self and allowing his divine Will to operate through you.I personally am not interested in giving up my sovereignty regarding my ability to reason and make my own choices. But, if you are, this book might just be for you.Also, just as a sidenote, this book has absolutely nothing at all to do with traditional Alchemy. True Alchemists need not concern themselves with the teachings of Mr and Mrs Prophet...er, I mean, ""St Germain."""
1,Are You Pulling My Leg?,"This book has nothing to do with Alchemy. In fact, this book has nothing to do with Saint Germain. It was written by Mr. or Mrs. Prophet (it isn't clear which one) who believes that he or she is channeling the spirit of Saint Germain on the subject of self transformation. This book actually states that the Beatles have Satanic origins. Page 173. After reading that page I had to put the book down I was laughing so hard."
1,Not by the Master,"I concur with Msrs. Ali and Tseng (among other reviewers) in that this book was not discharged by beloved Master Saint Germain, and really doesn't do any honor to the name of the Master. In fact, I doubt that ANY of the books marketed by Summit Lighthouse (with the exception, perhaps, of Summit's first publications) was discharged by ANY Ascended Being.One only needs to read ONE book really discharged by the Masters (take your pick, of the I AM Activity under Guy Ballard or of the Bridge to Freedom pre-1961 under Geraldine Innocente) to SENSE the difference."
1,Mismatched Title --- Nothing Much about Alchemy,"If you want to know what alchemy is all about, I think you can gather more from the Internet than from this book.If I could, I would give zero stars for this book.Serious doubts that the spirit channelled was St Germain.Don't waste your time and money on this book."
2,or 2.5 stars for herck and cheapness,"not enought good looking monsters-cheap, fake, short; i like the falling tree, story just barely ok. y cus's rated this so high was wrong-made me buy it but luckily for 2.6 dvd new wasnt too bad but shipping is mostly higher than the show which some of this $ always goes to show costs."
5,"Very Happy, Cheaper than the Coleman","I am not sure what the other guy is talking about, I looked for the less expensive Coleman style TV lantern, but could not find it. The Coleman product is at least $69.99, more expensive than this Innovage item. So, I took the plunge and ordered this lantern. The product is well made and very easy to understand. The TV gets surprisingly good reception, at least better than I thought. Overall, I really like this TV lantern and Coleman could not beat this price, for seemingly the same product."
2,Could have been great,"This should have been a great purchase at a good price. Everything works as advertised, good picture on TV, good lights, good radio...But there is no way to LIGHT an area and LISTEN or WATCH at the same time! You can listen in the dark, you can see in the silence, but don't try to both at the same time.If that fits your scenario, then this is the product for you. It's not my idea of safety or emergency preparedness."
4,Live hoogtepunt voor Acda en de Munnik,"Als je een fan bent van Acda en de Munnik mag deze cd eigenlijk niet ontbreken. Wat mij betreft is het een van de beste liveoptredens die ze gedaan hebben en ik heb er al vele gezien. Helaas staan niet alle nummers van het optreden op de cd, wat het kopen wat minder aantrekkelijk maakt. Toch is het uiteindelijk de moeite als je een echt goed optreden in je collectie wilt hebben"
4,The anti-Capitalist Nature of Nazism,"Compared with his better-known wartime diaries, Joseph Goebbels does not get much into philosophy. Rather, these early diaries (1925-1926) are centered on personages. In fact, the editor provides a helpful set of explanatory notes (pp. 116-123) that enable to reader to understand who Goebbels is talking about.There are nevertheless some insights given into Nazi thinking. Nazism has been misunderstood as simply an extreme form of German nationalism. Ironically, one of Goebbels writings had been: ""Why have we parted from the nationalists?"" (p. 39).National Socialism has commonly been misrepresented as extreme capitalism. In actuality, and consistent with later works, Goebbels repeatedly condemned capitalism, at least big capitalism (p. 42, 44, 132, 146). He spoke negatively of capitalism and Bolshevism in the same sentence (p. 44). Goebbels feared that, one day, German soldiers will be fighting once again as mercenaries of the capitalists."
5,No rip-offs here.,"This is the band I've been waiting for. Black Tie Dynasty bring a new twist on indie rock with their latest effort. I've heard way too many Coldplay and U2 rip-offs in the last few years, but BTD bring their own sound into a seemingly overcrowded genre. I think this band has some staying power."
1,A CHEAP IMITATION,"""Texas Rebel"" is a cheap imitation of Louis Lamour at his worst. It is an example of how somone with no talent can become published, using ""Vanity Press"". Nothing wrong with that, but how does he worm his way into favored treatment with bookstores?He dares, not only to rewrite General Robert E. Lee's life, but history as well.The publishing industry should police itself better."
4,Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear.,"This is a collection of cowboy music. Not REAL cowboy music, but rather the commercialized version that first became popular in the 1930s with the advent of ""singing cowboy"" movies. The four CDs in this set are divided by themes. Disc One is ""Cowboy Classics"". These are some of the best known western songs. Disc Two is ""Silver Screen Cowboys"". These are songs sung by western stars. Disc Three is ""Gene Autry & Roy Rogers"". These are songs by the two most popular singing cowboys. Gene and Roy also appear on all the other discs. Disc Four is ""Movie & Television Themes"". These are the theme songs from westerns, some of which are instrumentals. This is a really fun collection, especially for fans of old time westerns."
1,Needs remastering!,"The songs are wonderful but unfortunately, even a high-end system could'nt help the sound and fidelity."
4,1 gb ram for toshiba,I needed to expand the memory for my toshiba laptop to work better with Windows 7. And it worked.
1,Compatibility issues,"I was so happy with adding one more GB to my laptop till it started crashing the machine. I just gave it to my friend, and he is sending it for RMA after a month of use...Our experience is that it's compatible with 1/3 of the laptops we have."
1,"It's not DDR, But DDR2","The description shows DDR memory. When I open the packege and check it, it's DDR2. It can't fit my notebook. Please adjust this description and I would like to request full refund."
3,"PLEASE STATE LAPTOP MODEL, If commenting on memory",I am so glad y'all are happy / unhappy with yer purchases. But if you don't say what laptop it worked / did not work with ... you do no help to any reader.SO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE state your model!!!!Thanks.
5,easy upgrade,"When I got the board I thought It was the wrong one. I was fussing around filling out the return form, when my granddaughter (10) looked at the old boards and said. ""grandpa you have it upside down."" Yep, I did, and the new board snapped right in. It is hell, getting old..Be sure to use a static strap on your wrist to the computer.. The old mem boards would blow if you looked at them wrong. These new boards are pretty safe, but still better be safe than sorry...My old Gateway NX570(Vista) is really humming now.. Firefox (I remember the Gofer browser) loads much faster.A good test is the new Google Earth 6. The new ground level walk around mode will test your computer... GE works good with the new memory. But, while 1.5 gb is good,,, still could use another GB. Got to order another one."
5,The Name Says It All....,"The good thing about buying something with a name like Starrett attached to it, it automatically comes with a positive review across the board, because they built their name on quality products"
1,Disappointing,"I followed the guidelines as outlined in this book and found that it only made brief mention the most important parts of raising sugar gliders. The dietary information is largely incorrect, and upon review of the book by my veteranarian I've decided this book is only good for the pictures. It is best to speak to a vet experienced with sugar gliders and NEVER rely on a book such as this one."
2,This book was not very helpful,This book i feel was not very helpful! It did not have a variety of pictures. All of the pictures were of the same animal and it was always relieving itself! The did not include most of the information I found that I really needed to tame and care for my two sugar gliders
1,A mediocre guide to keeping the little fellas.,"Upon purchasing this book i immediately thought, 'Yes! My Sugar Gliders' will live prosperously now!'. However after 20 minutes of using this book, the smug grin was wiped off of my face. My favourite sugar glider 'Leslie Hughes' had died of lung cancer. The chapter 'Teaching your Sugar Glider to smoke Cigars' was partly responsible for this I feel."
4,Technical but helpful,"I liked this book becuase it was very helpful, but it is har to understand. This book was a very intresting book to read but I think much of the information was way to scientic and hard to understand. The pictures are great! The book was very helpful taking care of ""Joey."""
1,more fiction than fact,"the story is so-so, but embelishment is the writer's tool of choice. the picture of southern il as a dangerous place, to be feared, filled by backward, simple people is false, as are many of the other ""facts"". it may make a dull story more interesting, but if you want to write fiction, surely it could be better. i should know, i live in the town."
3,yeah it's okay,"I've read better true crime books, but this is better than most. A lot of unnecessary details are included. And then there are some strange omissions. We read about the doctor's parents a lot at the beginning and then it's just mentioned parenthetically along the way that they died.The book could have benefitted from a good paring down, say by 30%. But then they couldn't sell it for as much could they?"
4,Hometown Horror,It was interesting to read about this true story that took place not far from where I live. It is amazing that this man got away with things for as long as he did. What a truly evil man! I would suggest it even for someone who is not from around here. It was an interesting read.
5,A MUST HAVE FOR BEGINNERS!,"I am a script programmer for a software company that writes voice processing software for the financial industry.I just purchased this book today and must say that I am very impressed with it. I showed it to one of our web developers who is C++ and he was equally impressed. The format is easy to follow and the writer certainly knows the industry. I was impressed with the direct approach since I am a ""Learn By Doing"" individual. I am confident that after following the lesson plans I will be in a much better position to target a better programming position.Thanks"
1,Teach Yourself Visual Basic 6,"This book did not give enough instructions to complete the projects. Every time I tried to do one of the projects, I had to go to an experienced VB programmer to see what was missing. The programmer confirms that it is not ME!! He says that there is no way the projects could work if you follow the instructions the way they are written in the book. There were always key parts left out."
5,Customer Service for Creativity for Kids,"I have not used this product. However, if you have problems with this product, I suggest contacting the customer service department. My daughter received a creativity for kids project for her birthday and the paint in her box was dried out. I contacted customer service and they sent a complete product replacement (not just the paint). We have used several products and I routinely give these type of projects as gifts. I gave this product 5 stars based on my experience with the company."
5,In Their Own Words...,"This book is a set of excerpts from numerous and moving first-hand accounts. I had previously read several of the books/published war diaries from which they came but they have been remixed into a ""best of"" format that made for addictive reading. There are some descriptions of combat and its aftermath that leave one wondering how much a human can take and still function. Once I started reading the individual accounts, I was driven to keep reading the next and so on until I was finished.On the downside, the accompanying photos are the same old tired Signal Corps images but this can be forgiven by the strength of the narratives and the logical organization of topics. The prevailing mood of the stories is somewhat dark/pitiful but something like this should be done for every war that America participated in as a memorial to that generation's unique brand of sacrifice."
5,EXCELLENT! A MUST HAVE.,"This fantastic book has more than debt reducing and savings advice. It consists of very readable information about investments, taxes, and insurance. All the things we HAVE to know about (but either do not know where to begin reading or dread having to learn about) are laid out in an organized and simple manner in this book. Because of what I've learned from this book I can thoroughly understand anything in my life that concerns money and I can go on to read more indepth financial information."
5,avoid personal finance pitfalls with this book!,"ms. kobliner really knows how to speak to my generation!.. the book cuts through the fat and presents the info needed in an objective, concise and intelligent way... i hope she's still writing when i have kids!"
4,Required reading,I wish that I'd had this book six years ago when I was just starting out! This should be required for all twenty-somethings the moment they fly out of the nest. It was also very easy to read cover to cover - not boring or dry at all.
5,Great Intro to the Financial World,This book is great for gen-x-ers and really got me motivated about saving now for retirement. A great way to get your feet wet and learn the financial jargon so you can confidently walk into an investment firm and speak the right language. I recommend this to all of my friends in their late 20s/early 30s.
4,Very basic and understandable book,"Although It is a bit out-dated, still very good for learning the concepts of finance.(""Everything with .com is a hit!!!!"" not a good prognosis Mrs. Kobliner)"
2,"Good for folks in their 20's, not their thirties","The information in this book was the type that your big sister should have told you. I was lucky enough to have a big sister to explain these things so I didn't need the book. But if you are truly just starting out into adulthood, you'll enjoy the helpful hints such as how to evaluate the checking accounts offered from different banks or how to start a retirement account. If you're very young, if you're very new at being an adult, and if you have nobody to guide you this book has all the essential advice."
4,Good step-by-step financial manual...,"...but that's pretty much it. While useful, may become outdated in couple years. Financial planners might be interested in it, because of the easiness of explanations they can present to the clients. Also, it can be one of the short books to read, if you don't have time or not interested in something more extensive like Ric Edelman's The Truth about Money..."
2,A once-good book falls quickly into irrelevance,"This was actually the very first personal finance book I'd ever read, back in 1996. It was a good introduction to the subject and got me on my current saving-and-investing kick.But in light of the enormous financial changes this past year, I would only recommend this book to absolute novices. There has been no new edition since before the Roth IRA was introduced. The boom in online investing invites a chapter of its own, warts and all. If the author were to update this every so often, it might be a winner. As it is, what would be a five-star book in 1996 loses one star for each year without a new edition."
5,Informative useful book,I borrowed this book at the library and realized I had to buy it. It has excellent tips for managing your finances. It's simple to read but comprehensive at the same time. I especially found the section on financial filing useful-- I re-organized all of my documents based on this book's system. The perfect present for recent grads.
4,Great overview. It was really enlightening,"I moved to US 7 years ago, so all this stuff on retirement plans, mortgages, investments, was a big cloud of information to me. Very slowly I started learning about finances reading articles over the internet. When I got this book, I couldn't stop reading it. It gave me a great overview of how to put my financial life together. It is very easy to read. Yes, it's not the solution to all your financial problems, but it's a great overview with very enlightening information.The only thing I didn't find details about was 457 retirement plans (even though it talks about others). That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars."
5,Commonsense Financial Information,"My husband's youngest sister is just at the age where she's adventuring out on her own, this book provided a good financial framework for her to make sense of the world without looking to mom and dad for help."
5,Smart and Fast Read,"I wanted an intro into how I should be handling my student loan debt, credit card debt, and savings. It was very informative, and it's definitely set me on the right track to getting my finances in order."
2,A very patronizing book,"This is not a good book. Its awkward writing might be forgiven, if it wasn't for the fact that the author seems to feel that Generation X'ers are all pretty stupid about finance.Ms. Kobliner should give us some credit. Before she gets off on how Generation X'ers spend too much on credit cards, or how none of seem to know how to balance a checkbook, she could at least make a passing allusion to guys like Jerry Yang who made millions before he was even 25.For good, non-patronizing personal finance advice I recommend Andrew Tobias' books or Peter Lynch's great classics."
1,Get a Financial Life-Beth Kobliner,"Beth Kobliner gets a financial life when you purchase her book.Her insight is shortsighted and her scope is narrowly targeting those in their 20s and 30s.While events change our lives, Kobliner misses the opportunity to open our eyes to the aray of choices we have at our disposal.Not a good read.Good for her-she sold this book to secure her financial future."
3,tomb raider,it's ok but hard to see in the dark parts of the game. but i do enoy the game but it's ok.
4,Great Step for any Cube owner,"Tombraider is amazing on Gamecube it took Eidos and extra 9 months to develop the title for the Gamecube, and it shows the Graphics rival those of the 360 version and for a much better price, Controls are very tight and responsive, A wonderful addition to the Gamecube library."
4,Cache' still good good 12 years later,"Kirk's 4th solo release. A Columbia/Sony production with many guest artists including my personal favorites Marcus Miller and Gerald Albright. So many tunes are still hot! Although some have classified the CD as containing ordinary music, Kirk's sax speaks anything but ordinary sounds. Although there are several covers, the original tunes have pieces of jazz,R&B-soul, early hip/hop and certainly some gospel themes. Since thre were many copies sold, it is fairly easy to get your hands on. Worth the money."
3,V Tech review,"I have a 7 year old that has enjoyed this program. My only issue so far has been with the screen and graphics which are very hard for us to see (we are used to normal computer screen) and sometimes makes it difficult to track. Otherwise, she is having fun with it."
5,Moved my soul!,"This book gave me ""chicken skin"". Now I know why the call to Hawaii is the call to the soul. Everyone who has the inkling there is something more to life than the insanity and the eight to five should read this book!"
5,Sensational! Absolutely Mystical!,"This book touches a very special place in you. It fills a void, not only for the vacationer and the person who dreams of paradise, but the spritual seeker. Whether you are traveling to the islands, have been there or are searching for the mystical, this book is for you. The inferences to the paranormal and the wisdom of the ancient Hawaiians pose incredible questions for science, at this, our defining moment in all history."
4,A bit New Agey but Mystical too,"There are a couple of places where the author veers off a bit but for the most part he draws the reader into the mystical side of Hawaii that captivates the imagination and adds a new layer of ""must do"" items for ones next visit to the big island.I particularly enjoyed the parts where he explores the subtleties expressed in the Hawaiian language and how they relate to place names and metaphysical practices and experiences. I think the author does a good job of connecting modern places and practices to traditional Hawaiian belief and faith practices. His chapter on the Big Island's place of refuge is exceptional in this regard."
5,Inspiration for a heart's journey- Aloha state of mind,"It is a book about Hawaii. And it is a book about metaphysics and the vibrations a sensitive person will encounter.It is not the ""ordinary travel companion"", for ordinary vacations of ordinary people. It is about embarking a journey, an inner one. Extraordinary.Beautifully written by (Pila Chiles, Pila of Hawai'i), you will encounter an inspiring transformation of your soul into the ""Aloha state of mind""- not only in Hawaii but wherever you go and are- here and now.I highly recommend this book!Thomas Barth ..."
5,Necessary fuel for anyone who feels the fire to truly LIVE.,"In his beautiful narrative, author Pila Chiles, gifted seer and healer, speaks honestly to the hearts of all those in search of Truth and Light. The magical island of Hawaii serves as the enchanting backdrop of this important spiritual work, but the message belongs to every human soul who has ever craved True Contentment. This book should be included on the top ten list of spiritually important books for the new millenium."
5,An inspirational and enlightening book about your own spirit,"This book will call to your soul an answer to the question...what is it I've been looking for? Each person has the answer and the necesary tools to find and express that answer. You just have to believe that is the truth, because it is!!This is an easily read book that surely will tug at heartstrings. Well worth the investment of time and resources to buy and read"
2,The Secrets and Mysteries of Hawai'i is not captivating as other books I've read on Hawai'i,The book is more fiction than nonfiction. Many of the ideas are made up and not authentic. So I am .disappointed
2,Huh?,"I had high hopes for this book, but it made little sense and quickly got boring. I'm sure Pila is a good guy, but this book was essentially nonsense."
1,Save your money,I did not care for this product at all.It had a taste that I do not wish to describe.I had to pour it out. I could not give it away!
1,Tastes Terrible-- No Fuji Apple Taste.,If you like a sparkling BITTER SOUR beverage this is for you. Nothing like a Fuji apple. I'll stick with Moet&Chandon when it comes to sparkling beverages.
2,Not worth your time.,"This movie isn't worth watching. Therefore it's not worth my time to write a long drawn out review of this movie. I just have a few words for it. Boring. This movie stretches out a 60 minute film to nearly 2 hours. I love long movies (more for your money, right?) but this was pointless. The characters were completely unlikable. I never once felt sorry for them. I just wanted them to quit their constant whining about how busy they are and how their father abandoned them. Who cares!"
1,Won lots of awards. Consider yourself warned.,"Look at the box. 8 different awards on the cover. Never a good sign, these days. I love the two actors. Laura was amazing inBreach (Widescreen Edition). Phillip knocked my socks off inCharlie Wilson's War (Widescreen).I made it through 10 minutes of this movie, sitting through depressing elderly either feeble minded or taken to writing on the wall with their own poop, the daughter who steals office supplies, conducts personal business from work, humps a married guy she clearly can't stand, and has an emotional outburst when she's phoned about her dad.... at this point, I couldn't take any more of the movie and gave up. Dysfunction isn't my idea of funny.Do yourself a favor and watch Charlie Wilson's War instead... some very funny lines there. And Breach is a masterpiece."
1,wretchedly unhappy movie,"I would never have finished watching this movie if Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman had not been in it. These two are actors' actors. They just never have a false moment. This movie, however, is just plain sad. Spoiler alert: was the conclusion supposed to be a happy one for them because their dad died and they could get back to their own lives? I agree that it is a part of life that we all will have to cope with (if we arn't already) but it was despressing. I just expected more and was disappointed in the premise."
3,A good watch,"Best movie ending ... ever. A film worth watching, The Savages explores the complexities of two siblings called on to care for their elderly estranged father with dementia. I don't understand the perspective of the reviewers who didn't like the ending ... I thought it was upbeat and perfect."
3,Savages,Movie was depressing at parts but shows you what different families go through especially when caring for the elderly.
2,Savagely Depressing,"This is not a bad film if you look at it as a piece of film making. The acting is not bad, the directing is not bad and the over all film is not bad. It is also about an important subject. BUT... it is do depressing that I can't think of any reason that I would want to watch it again and if I would have know how depressing it was I wouldn't have watched it in the first place.Depressing."
1,"Phony, shallow, unbelievable, pretentious, and annoying","What a disappointment this movie is. Nothing about it is believable. None of the angst the characters are supposed to be experiencing rings true at all, nor does their sudden concern for their father's welfare after a lifetime of abuse and estrangement. The only thing that is at all believable is the bickering between the two siblings, and that does not make for a meaningful or entertaining movie-watching experience.I come from a dysfunctional family myself, also with dying or recently dead parents, and I resent the cavalier way Tamara Jenkins turns the situation into a cheesy soap opera with a happy ending. There can be no happy endings in families like that. The Savages is cheap (and I don't mean low-budget), pretentious, and annoying."
1,Is It Done Yet?,"Are we there yet? Can I get that hour of my life back?It's not nice to ""savage"" such a highly-acclaimed film about such an important, relevant, timely subject. Movies should be made about this topic. But not this badly-written, ham-handed tripe.The main actor appeared very natural, most of the time, which really made him stand out in sharp contrast with those who think annoying=emoting. The dialogue was hackneyed, cliched, and just awful. Characterization was flat in places and non-existent in others.It doesn't matter if your heart's in the right place, movie, or if I agree with you. Don't preach at me, don't insult my intelligence, don't neglect entertaining me, and don't expect me to fall in line with the film festivals.Is this review savage enough for you? Heh heh. Let this paragraph stand as proof that SAVAGES makes the viewer stupid."
4,PAINFULLY HONEST LOOK AT DEMENTIA!,"I watched two films dealing with Dementia in one day and no two films could have been more different. The other film 'Away From Her' was as good, but for different reasons. This film really hit home for me as I have had to deal with this in my own family. The film paints a realistic view of the emotional drain, guilt, and process of letting go, but also deals with sibling relationships as well. This is a very good film with excellent performances and dialogue that rings true!"
5,a timely story--I loved it,"I'm glad I didn't see this film first in theaters, but now, a year later when I can laugh all the more at the accuracy of its story about wounded adult children struggling to deal with their dying father. Great acting, excellent script, compelling story and characters, nicely filmed and edited, entertaining AND it has something to say. Not sweet or bitter, sentimental or tragic, this is the reality that every generation deals with if they live long enough, and I found a lot to make me smile, some sadness, commiseration, and closure--I haven't seen anything to compare."
5,Two great actors in an American classic,"I love these two actors, anyway, and this movie would be much duller without them. The subject matter is one which is pretty real to a lot of adults now: dealing with a fragile elder parent, and all the emotions that brings up. There's humor in it, and pathos. I loved it."
4,A Touching Adult Family Drama with Wit,"Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman are the sort of actors who can make virtually any film worth watching, and having the two of them in this movie brings a story to life that would have otherwise been very hard to appreciate. Laura Linney plays a very immature woman who is trying to produce a play about her childhood, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays her brother, who is a professor struggling to get his own career out of the doldrums. They confront the problems of helping their aging father to move into a nursing home, and in the process of doing so discover how to move forward with their own lives. Lots of dry wit, powerful performances and a great ensemble of supporting actors. Hard to see if you're not comfortable with aging, but it helps to put the process into a good perspective."
3,SUNSET,"Realistically depicting old dementia-stricken abusive man's last days, this story portraits complexity of inter-family relations while family last time united, emotionally and geographically, around a father last weeks prior to his passing away.Rather artificial plot is very much sustained with good performance."
1,Does NOT Support Standard Flip Chart Pads!!,"Wanting to purchase a more premium grade combination Dry Erase & Flip Chart Board, I tried this Boone Reversible (since Boone is the only brand stocked by OfficeMax and Office Depot).This board will NOT grip or support a Standard Flip Chart Pad. For 170 dollars, I expect this product to do what is claimed. Unlike most boards that use a pair of Screw-in studs to support the pads, the Boone Reversible has a weak clamp (actually a glorified clothes-pin) that will hold a Standard Flip Chart Paper Pad for about 20 seconds. Then the pad falls to the floor.SUMMARY: A surprisingly incompetent design failure."
4,Good Quality,I have been using the first roll that I bought a year back even now and it serves the purpose very well. It holds the wax well and I get a clean sweep everytime.
2,Just ok,The wax and cloth are just ok. Its not the most convient product to use and didnt work really well.
4,Good and value to the price,I ordered this product from amazon and really satisfied with it. It arrived in time.
2,How to fix the distortion,"If you haven't bought this frame yet, don't buy it. Look elsewhere.I got this as a gift and was determined to make it work. If you set the aspect ratio to 4:3 then your pictures will display properly, but won't fill up the screen. The default is 16:9 which stretches the photos and distorts them.The trick is to distort (compress) them so that look ok when stretched. Using a photo editing tool, select a 1000 by 500 pixel portion of your photo. Then change the image properties to 700 by 500. The key is to uncheck the ""maintain aspect ratio"" box. On your PC, your photo will now look squished. But when loaded to the frame it now look fine.I used the editor that came with my Canon camera, but you can download the free IrfanView to do it."
2,cheap but not good,I bought this for my wife for Christmas and got a 1Gb SD card for it as well. I started loading in pictures on the card but there's no point in putting alot on it. This thing is slower than molasses and most images don't look very good. Not the best gift I ever gave her...fortunately I bought jewelry as well!
4,Nitro ..NOT HARDLY,"Well besides the fact that It took me over a monthe to get this item maybe i expected to much. Since it was sooo hard to find i thought it would do more. The games are okay, my son is 8. but the screen is hard to see it has to be at a certain angle. I was hoping that the screenwas color. I like the games but some of the games are too juvenile for my 8 y.o. Its asks question like what does Cat start with, etc..its a toss up, if i spent more than $38.67, i think i would be upset. (compliments of Walmart.com)..I personally think its for a younger crowd may be 6-9 year old. older kids like my son will be bored SOON!. ill just pass it to my 3y.o when shes about 4-5...happy holidays all!!!!"
5,great laptop,"this computer looks like a laptop. it is really cool. my son is6 years old, and has recently got it. he has been playing with it every chance he gets. it has great learning tools. it isvery age appropriate. the best thing it has challenging levels , when the work becomes too easy. you can go on to the next level. i would recommend this computer highly, especially if your child is struggling with reading or math."
4,My Stepdaughter's love it!!,"My mother purchased two for my stepdaughter's (8 & 9) this past Christmas and they absolutely love playing with them. They like the games okay, but they love the feature where their dad and I can leave messages for them. Every time they come over it's a mad rush to their ""laptops"" to see what messages they were left. They just love them!!Personally, I was disappointed that it didn't come with a cord to plug them in with, but hopefully they will be sick of them by the time the batteries die (finger's crossed lol). Also the screen is very small and has no backlight, which makes it very difficult to read, at least for 30 year old eyes. They do take quite a beating though as my SD's have put those thing's through everything imaginable and they're still working great!!So the kids love them and I could go either way. As long as they enjoy playing with them though, I like them too!!"
3,Kids found it frustrating,"Good: challengingBad: Small, black and white screen.My kids, who are both in a private school and doing very well, found this toy frustrating. They rarely play with it and we just got it for Christmas. I thought the screen would be bigger, so it's hard to sit next to them and try to help them with some of the excercises, which I thought might help hold their interest (parental involvment). My younger son, who is four, enjoys it more than his five year old brother, but not to the point where he can't wait to play with it. They much prefer their V-Smile Video games to this, which is a shame considering I paid a hundred bucks for two of them.Also, the controls are difficult for them to operate. It doesn't seem to be enough like a real laptop for them to get it. Maybe it's just me...but I'm slightly disappointed in this."
2,Disappointing,"I'm surprised by the number of ""5 stars"" and that is what motivated me to write this review.My 5 year old enjoys using my laptop and is a whiz at his Leapster, and this led his grandfather to think this would be a great gift. When we opened the gift it looked so neat, I could see the attraction, but I agree with all of those who have talked about the small black-and-white display with very poor resolution. The games are not nearly as good as those on the Leapster and the laptop is pretty large to take places. After a few minutes playing on his laptop, he always asks to play on my laptop. If anything, it has increased his desire to use my computer, and this is not good.We have a VTECH digital camera that is great - I'm surprised by how poor the graphics are on the Nitro Laptop. Even at that low price, the technology is at a point where they should be able to offer something better."
2,"A ""notebook""?","I was very disappointed to receive the Nitro Notebook an discover that the actual ""computer screen"" is smaller than that on the Leapsters that my children have. Most of the screen is a plastic film picture that borders the ""computer screen."" I was further disappointed to find that the animation is not as good as the Leapster. My kids seemed to like them (ages 5 and 6) and told their friends they got ""notebook computers"" for Christmas, but the new Leapster cartridges Santa brought have gotten a lot more playtime than the Nitro Notebook. I recommend the Leapster -"
4,some notebooks say 5 and some say 6,"The notebook is a little too old for a 5 year old but will be great for a first grader to help them learn to add and spell. The key board functionality is really pretty close to a regular laptop. My 5 year old niece loves the ability to type in a ""Word"" format. We haven't explored all the games yet but they seem to be very simplistic. (She needs help to get into different functions though.) Over all a good introduction into a keyboard and computer."
4,V.Smile Notebook,"I gave this to my two neice for Christmas, my sister says they really enjoy the notebook and it takes my neice off their parents computer to learn basics."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I was so excited to purchase this for my 4 year old for Christmas. When I opened it up, however, I was SO disappointed! The pictures of the screen that you see online look like a normal laptop computer, with a screen full of colorful games. The pictures are very deceptive, though, because when you open it up, the screen has a picture over most of it, and the actual screen where the game appears is appx. a 2""x4"" window, with only black and white games.It's a cool toy, but don't expect it to actually be similar to a real computer."
3,"Had it for a year, was RARELY used...","This was one of those expensive Christmas gifts that entertained my six year old for all of fifteen minutes. He was bored because it was not at all challenging. It was advertised that there were cartridges you could buy that would provide more activities, but in the year we've had this, I have yet to find any. I was just looking to see if there were any links on [...], but there don't seem to be..."
3,not satisfied with display,the screen of this laptop is my primary concern . its so small and in black& white . i wonder how kids follow it . rest of features are good. spanish is irretating .i wish the laptop was had a colour display and more basic games to start of with
3,An ok learning toy.,I bought this for my son's 5th birthday. He only played with it a few times. The little screen is black and white and there are only 2 games with it. I'm getting my son a Leapfrog Leapster for his 6th birthday. Probably what I should have gotten him in the first place. I DO NOT recommend this toy.
4,"""Good""","My children love its Spanish features. They were a little disappointed by the size of cartridges which contain only one song and story each. Overall, they have great fun with the notebook."
3,not for up to age 11,"I bought this for a 9 year old, but this laptop is definitely for a younger age...even thought it is marketed for 5-11. I would say 5 to 7 max."
2,Night vision,We were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday. After opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied. However the screen is very disappointing. I can't even rate the games because overall I simply just can't see what is on it. The product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing. I should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products. I would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it.
2,poor screen quality,"My kids are used to playing games on a computer so the screen was very disappointing. It is very poor quality, but perhaps that is why it is so inexpensive. I wish I had taken the advice of some other viewers and gone to a store to see it in person. I will be trying to sell mine again."
2,Perhaps not for kids 6 and over......,"...this is not what I'd thought it'd be. Screen is a bit dark, although that's not the main problem. The main issue is that my daughter's almost 7 and she's bored with this already. Frankly, you'd be better off with small, hand-held puzzle gadgets. For kids 5 and younger, this would be of benefit."
3,not for ages listed,"The description said this was for ages 6-11, however according to the manual, the math was addition and subtraction, and there was only basic reading. Seems it would only be for up to grade 2 tops."
3,Just OK,"My 5 year old plays with this lap top quite a bit, but is already getting bored with the games it came with. The graphics are disappointing, and the voice is too baby-like. I am also disappointed that we are not able to purchase any additional cartridges, which means that it is going to be obsolete in just a couple of months. Too bad!"
4,Good toy for kids a bit irritating for parents,I bought my daughter this laptop because she wanted one to play games on (she's 6). So when it came in she was so excited. She loved it from day 1 which is great but the sounds it makes can drive an adult crazy. We own several kids' laptops but I do have to admit that this one is my kids favorite.
1,DO NOT BUY until you have seen one in person.,"Huge disappointment. Screen is VERY DARK and almost impossible to see, and though the size of the screen is about what I expected, its resolution (pixel size) is terrible. I say BE SURE TO SEE ONE IN PERSON before you put down even a nickel for this item. Be sure you know what you're getting, then make your decision. Actually, just don't buy one and look for another item."
4,"Ok, but returned for a Leapster instead","I got these for my boys for Christmas, and although they liked them, we ended up returning them and getting Leapsters instead. The screen on here is too small, and the black/white/green screen is hard to see. I found the Leapster to be a bit easier to see and use. I did like some of the learning features on here though, such as Spanish and other subjects that aren't found on a Leapster."
1,Waste of time,"Screen is dark, Battery life sucks and my nephew used it for an hour and it went to his pile of junk toys. dont waste ur money."
5,VTech Nitro Notebook Electronic Learning Device,I gave this Notebook to my 5 year old grandson. His parents says that he really enjoys sitting at his desk or on the sofa using it. According to them it was an ideal gift. I highly recommend.
5,vTech Nitro Notebook,"I gave my 5year old son this Vtech Nitro Notebook for Christmas. He loves it. It is very educational and has really helped him with his spelling. My 4 year old daughter,started using it more then he did, so I had to get her the pink Nitro Notebook. They spend 30 to 45 minutes each day exploring and talking about the new things they find, when using the Nitro. I know it is a wonderful educational source."
3,"Engaging, but it has filler added to it.","This is a good book, but it would have been much better if the author had not decided to add ""filler"". The best example is the chapter ""DIM-1"", which explains in quite some detail, the working of digital microchips. While this may be interesting, it is not related to the book's tagline: How two Americans Invented the Microchip and Launched a Revolution"".There are some technical mistakes, like showing a bipolar transistor structure, and labeling its pins ""Drain, Gate, Source"", whereas it should be: ""Collector, Base, Emitter"".Those issues aside, the book is very engaging, and the author does a superb job of explaining difficult technical material to non-techies."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book,which I read after I saw the author on C-Span's Book TV. The material would have made a good magazine article. The actual invention of the intergrated circuit was given short shift. A better treatment of this subject and a better book in general was Crystal Fire, which was about the invention of the transistor."
3,reader's digest version of semiconductors and IC's,"I was literally stunned by the first three chapters in this book. The author seems to have gleamed what little he knowsof electronic history from Life magazine or maybe popular mechanics. There is very, very little mention of the impact of Germany and quantum theory in his history of semiconductors. His description of valance electrons and holes is almost comical.I was expecting him to pronounce Sarnoff asthe wizard of the age, which he sort of does with Edison -one of early electricity's greatest hacks and the 'great'marconi,he who was so fond of ripping off tesla's patents.Maybe the later edition is somewhat more worthwhile, the edition I bought was from amazon marketplace and althoughI thought I was receiving the current edition, I was sold the book with a 1984 copyright. People it pays to havemerchants actually sell you the book that is listed.I guess if you like really easy going and simplified story telling this book is for you."
2,Ok for beginners but little evaluative comment.,"The authors provide little technical comment or evaluative reviews of various air guns or air gun types. For example, you will find no tests showing true velocites compared to advertised claims; nor will you find comment on the quality of the trigger, accuracy, or loudness. So, while you will get a general overview of air guns you will not get the kind of information or reviews needed to help you decide which gun best meets your needs."
1,"Poorly written, see-no-evil book","THe author writes columns about airguns in a few magazines too. The problem is that his published works seems like puff pieces for various airgun companies--he never has a bad word to say. Consider this as a book of extended product ads and you won't go wrong. Just don't make a buying decision based on it.Some of the Digest articles were either from his magazine columns of the same era, or his magazine cloumns from this book. (Columns of the There are few airguns books out, but nearly any are better than this if you want to have in-depth knowledge about airguns. I suggest books by TOm Gaylord, or the book Airguns; from trigger to target.That said, this is a good obsolete book form learning about some airguns available in a shallow, non-critical way."
3,"Interesting, but out of date","J.I. Galan has written a fair amount about airguns (and more) in the sporting press, and this book does have a fair bit of useful information. Unfortunately it's now over a decade old, and even when it came out it wasn't particularly up to date or comprehensive; it's more of a scattershot collection of essays on various airguns and airgun topics. It's still a useful (and enjoyable) book for serious airgun fans, but as a reference manual it has its limits."
3,"old songs good, new songs lacking.","I'm a country rock and roller.The newer songs on this album really stink.But when you have classics such as Gator Country,Dreams i'll never see,Whiskey Man & Fall of the peacemakers how can you go wrong.The older songs save this album,Therefore i give it 3 stars."
2,at best mediocre,"Molly Hatchet is not Lynyrd Skynyrd or Blackfoot, but they play so called ""southern rock"". Sometimes they actually manage to write a good song (like ""Fall of the peacemakers"") but most of the time they display low talent (or lack of effort) in that department. Molly Hatchet like other bands have changed their line up over the years but they have never been able to recruit a great singer and I don't think these guys are under rated in any way. And who the hell choose their album covers? They're better suited for Manowar...By the way, this record is no longer in my collection..."
2,was this BP that confused a shock absorber with an O-Ring,"Get with it man. The photo is of a cheap OEM shock absorber - but the p/n and the description is a set of 3/8"" O-Rings by Motocraft for an A/C compressor. Looks like another job by British Petroleum."
4,Pickford Program Perfection minus 1 * !,"If you have never seen Pickford in action, this is the biography to watch for it is chock full of short footage of the incomparable Mary doing her screen antics. Displaying scenes from her rare unseen silents & talkies, ""A Life on Film"" made me want to go out searching for Pickford reels to spin for myself. I especially love the scenes of Mary from ""Cinderella,"" ""Rosita"" (A rare Lubitsch classic) and ""Hoodlum!"" not to mention ""Secrets"" which is a Pickford's last talkie. Another thing I love is the home movie footage of Pickford, Chaplin and Douglas. I gave it Minus 1 * because the menu is sparse and there is no extras included. I would have liked a Pickford ""Biograph"" short to be included or a feature just to wet the appetite of the viewer more but oh well . . . (NOTE TO MILESTONE: Keep those Pickford Pictures coming!!)"
5,Works exactly as advertised,"Sensor works just as advertised. Easy to install. You set the desired distance (1,2 or 3 feet) from front bumper (setting on back of unit) and then yellow light flashes at first slowly, then rapidly and finally red. When red you are right at distance set. Highly recommend this product."
1,Never Worked,I just spent the last two hours trying to get this product to work with no success. I installed it per the manufacturer's instructions and it will not recognize my vehicle no matter how I configure the transmitter. I've tried every conceivable trick and can not get the LED to light up at all. The batteries are fresh and have been tested with a voltmeter and are installed correctly. It simply does not work and will be returned for a refund.
4,Backup warning light,"Works as advertised, easy installation. I would suggest using the provided screws, if possible. The Velcro does not adhere as well. Otherwise product does the job."
1,No good,"I tried two of these and both do not work. The concept is great, but just would not work properly. I set it up to register At three feet. Not sure if it would work better at a shorter distance."
2,Less than reliable,"Bought 2. After about a year, one became unreliable. The other still works OK. However, the 1ft - 2ft - 3ft incremental adjustments make it useless if you want to stop 18 inches away. Wasn't a problem at our previous place. Makes them useless in our new place (unless I lose more weight so that I can squeeze through a 1 foot opening)."
1,"Low quality, poor overall implementation for a simple device","This device went through 3 sets of batteries in aprox. 3 months time (there are 4 AAA batteries required to run this device), each month draining the batteries, until in month 4 the device stopped working. I would not recommend this device from GE to anyone, GE has ""cheeped out"" and built the lowest cost/quality device that they can ship."
4,Working well so far.,I have only had this for a few months. It is working as it should so far. The distance setting works well. I only gave it 4 stars because of the short time I have used it. After the 1st year I will submit an update.
5,Finally!!!!!!!,"This concert was recorded Live at the Dollywood Theater on December 12th & 13th 2002. This concert was part of Dolly's Halos & Horns tour. I saw her during this tour in London in november 2002. It was an absolutely thrilling, emotional, suprising and funny evening. One of the best concerts I ever saw. I am glad this concert is finally out on DVD.The Halos & Horns tour was Dolly first tour in more than 10 years......and it was worth waiting for!!!!!The concert features songs from her albums ""the grass is blue"". ""Little Sparrow"" and ""Halos & Horns"" plus some of her classic hits.I recommend this DVD to everybody....you will enjoy it. Also check out the Live-CD of Dolly's same concerttour"
5,Truly Dolly,"This concert is ""truly Dolly"". Lots of interaction with the audiance and lots of Dolly's fabulous energy. I would highly recommend this to all Dolly fans."
5,Highly recommended for anyone,"Dolly is an amazing performer, and this DVD demonstrates just how talented she is. I'd recommend it for anyone!"
3,very good blend-but!,i have to agree with the other reviewers-this is a nice blend of seasonings. my only gripe is that it seems to be very salty.the combination of the two salts overpowers everything else!
5,A gourmet wonder!,"I've been using the original flavored Borsari for just over a year now. It is outstanding on any kind of red meat. The savory flavor is just unbelievable and will add an instant professional flavor to any grilled, seared, or broiled red meat. Simply sprinkle over meat, let sit to room temperature, and cook to your liking. I get more compliments on this than anything made from scratch. The citrus and orange flavors are nice with poultry or fish, and also make great fresh salad dressings mixed with oil and vinegar.Any of these products will add and instant gourmet flavor to your cooking and elevate your dishes to new heights."
5,Best Pacifiers!,"My daughter is a ""binky baby"" and these are the best. She won't touch any other type. I love the fact that they were created by orthodontists! The collapsible nipple was engineered to not mess up a child's teeth as they grow in. Love it! We own about 10 of these. They're definitely worth your money."
3,"Good. But, daughter chewed through it!","I love avent paci's. Both my kids took to them right way and they didn't interfere with breastfeeding.My son stopped using them at 6 months old on his own.My daughter is 20 months old and still using them. So, we made sure we had the bigger sizes for her.She sleeps with them (only time they're used)..and recently, I checked under her bed to get her one that had dropped..and I found like 4 of her avent paci's that had been chewed through! She chewed the tips off of them! I don't know where they went but thank god she didn't choke!!!!I obviously have taken away all paci's from her now. But, make sure you watch your kiddos with teeth carefully!!!"
3,Faithfully Recreates the Original Vinyl Sleeve!,"This 1960 recording of the great George Gershwin's ""Concerto in F"" and ""Rhapsody in Blue"" has been reissued in an accurate replica of the original vinyl release. The sound quality though isn't that great and is barely audible at normal volume levels. Still, Andres Previn and Kostelanetz are not to be blamed and their performances of Gershwin's works stand the test of time and remain standards along with perhaps Bernstein's version. Although the hisses and other audio deficiencies have not been completely eliminated in this cd transfer, this is still a worthy addition to your classical music library - at least until something better comes along. That might just be some time though...."
5,Wooden ship model,I am enjoying building this wooden model. Some what advanced model. lots of detail. A very historical ship in the oyster business.
3,PC not best format for map reading (+XP compatibility tip),"I love big colorful maps. So I thought this is the program for me. But, the program is just OK, I was hoping for better but it is just plain difficult to read huge fold out maps on a PC. However, if you put your resolution up to as high as possible 1280x1024 works pretty well (I'd never use this normally), it improves things noticeably.I ordered this then saw the comments on XP compatibility. Absolutely no response from the help desk, however: I have XP and it works fine.You just need to use the XP compatibility option as follows:1. Right Click on CD-Rom on My computer and hit explore.2. On the setup icon on the CD right click and hit properties3. Select Compatibility tab and select Windows 95.4. Hit Apply and close box5. Double Click on Set-up Icon and the program will installThe Website actually mentions that this program won't work on XP and offers no guidance. Bit of an embarrassment.Good luck and regards"
1,"won't install on XP, no support or solution","I got the deluxe version and got stuck for $50, same problem as reviewer above. The thing won't install and there is no support or fix form National Geographic, or Broderbund, who is listed on the box as the distributor. I would have expected better form such a big name company(s)!"
2,Where's the band?,"The concert is apparantly after Young and Stiles left the band, leaving Richie Furay doing all vocals. Guitars couldn't be heard well. Sound mix was bad."
2,Less than you guess,"I was looking for a reunion concert or a documentory. This is neither, it's a band called ""Buffalo Springfield Revisited"" in concert. There are a couple of old Springfielders, the bass and drums I think. In fairness, they do a decent job of covering the original band, the lead vocalist has a very Springfield tone. Not what I was looking for."
1,You can be in my dream if I can be in yours,"Okay. Buyer beware and all that. Anyone who bought this thinking it was anything other than a tribute band is living in a dream world. Okay, you spent 10 bucks and you're P.O'd. I can appreciate that. But just to set the record straight, Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin were just as much a part of the Springfield as those other higher-profile dudes we all know and love; so lighten-up. Bad mouthing them only points up your own ignorance."
1,Buffalo Springfield Revisited - In Concert,"Buffalo Springfield Bass Player ? NO Richie Furay, Neil Young, Steven Stills or Jim Messina, but a very good lounge band playing the songs. Who will their next DVD be ? The Beatles revisted - In Concert ? Probably. EXTREMELY deceptive. ""Revisted"" must be the leagal loophole. I must contact this company imediately about my ""Greatful Dead Revisited"". Please come see me at a stadium near you this summer !!!"
1,Frivilous Waste of Time and Rip-Off!,"I got this thing 3 weeks ago and haven't even opened it. It's not the Springfield. Some night when I don't anything to do, I might watch it. But it's unlikely. My garage band from the 70's was much better than this because we cared and we were real. These guys should be sued for copyright infringement. How Stills, Young and Messina permitted this to happen, only God knows. Don't waste your money. Better: Buy Stills' new album, ""Man Alive"" or Young's ""Living With War."" Both are superb."
3,Buffalo Springfield Revisited,"The first concert i ever saw was the Buffalo Springfield in February of 1968 and what a show it was. Although Stills was performing his boogie version of ""For What It's Worth"", never my favorite rendition of the song, Stills and Young performed a ferocious twin lead attack on the classic ""Bluebird."" Only two members of the original Springfield, bass player Bruce Palmer and drummer Dewey Martin appear on this video. They do attempt to recapture the ""magic"" of the original but fall well short of the original Buffalo Springfield in concert."
1,"If Neil Young were dead, he'd roll over in his grave.","When you think of Buffalo Springfield the first names that cross your mind are Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin, Yeh right! This is one of the biggest rip offs I have ever seen. The performances of this no-name group of wanna bees is poor at best. The overall technical quality of the DVD is very poor, which in this case is good. It masks the inadequacies of the musicians. Amazon.com deserves some of the credit for this disappointment, since they did not make it clear that this was a garage band headed by the only two members of Buffalo Springfield that had little or no talent of their own. If you are considering this DVD, you would be better off eliminating the middleman and flushing your money directly down the toilet. That's where this DVD belongs. This gets one star since they do not allow for anything lower."
4,Cool Songs by the famous entertaniers!!!,"These songs are hilarious. If you ever watched their shorts, you will laugh. Some like ""Play a Simple Melody"" and ""Old McDonald had a Farm"" are some old classics. The ABC song though is from one of there shorts. They teach a whole bunch of schoolkids by singing the alphabet and the kids take over. This is a must item for kids and even adults."
5,Band Director,This is a great percussion book and a great source for band rhythm drills. I'm using it in grades 6-8
5,Fun Fun Fun,Love this one by my favorite boys.. it takes their fun songs to another level.. I use this to work out with.. the beats keep my momentum up when I'm on the treadmill
5,ADORABLE,"WHEN I ORDERED THE BENCH, EVEN THO IT SAID IN PLAIN SIGHT 2 BENCHES, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ONE AND I STILL BOUGHT IT. THEY ARE EVEN MORE ADORABLE IN PERSON. I WAS DELIGHTED TO RECIEVE THEM AS A PAIR. I HAVE THEM RIGHT BY MY LITTLE WATER FALL. EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND I FIND MY 2 YEAR OLD GRAND DAUGHTER SITING ON THEM. GREAT PHOTO OP. LOL JUST PROVED TO ME HOW STURDY THE LITTLE BENCHES ARE, EVEN THO THEY ARE ONLY FOR DECORATION. I WOULD SAY YES TO ANYONE THAT IS LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT LAWN OR YARD DECO. GOES PERFECT WITH ALL MY SOLAR LIGHTS AND CREATURES AND THE POND. PERSONALLY I THINK I GOT MORE THEN WHAT I PAID FOR, AND WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR ITEMS FROM THIS SELLER. VERY VERY PLEASED. THANK YOU SO MUCHSINCERELYJODI/JOELYN"
3,finding a gem in the mundane,"this review goes out under the name of my life-partner, bruce, but is written by dennis milam-and not bruce! as another reviewer comments, joe schenck(in the lead role) stands out as the best thing about this film. he is very good and obviously talented. he manages to play 3 different versions of himself. the scene at the end in the coffeeshop and afterwards is a good illustration of his abilities. he is handsome, but it was refreshing to see a gay mens' film with guys who look like ""regular gay guys""- good-looking but not the usual gym-bunny stereotype.they're the kind of guys i'd want to marry(if i wasn't already!) mr.schenck,whom i'd never seen before, has a presence when on-film. the film itself is sweet and fun but no cinematic classic by any means and could have used better editing and tightening. however, it is worth watching."
4,very interesting,"I did get a spiral bound reprint which also contained annotations from one or more mentally disturbed individuals who pose as experts. without those the book would have been a delightful and insightful read especially considering the time it was written, the 50s. unfortunaley the many stupid remarks are hard to ignore in the flow of reading."
2,"Good product, but slightly overpriced",The quality of this product was not much different from a more basic home store item. The mesh is not as fine as I was expecting or I felt portrayed. It has not held up well in the dishwasher either.
4,A good racquet for a strong player,"When I owned this racquet as a teenager I loved it and when the time came, I bought a new one. However, now that I am older and don't get to play as much I find this racquet requires just too fast a swing for me to maintain over a full hour or so of playing.That said, if you like to hit the ball hard and can do so with a fast swing, then you will LOVE this racquet. It is also great for those control freaks who are capable of providing their own power when they need it. And the price is decent too."
5,Ultimate control,It's a DAMN good racquet... What an amazing thing that has withstood the test of time... Feel the power of this beast
2,Some good ideas but too long and overly general,"The Woodlot Management Handbook has some good ideas but the gist of the book could be presented in one third the space. Many common sense observations are previewed, presented, and then recapped. Although written for the novice, this bookanoyingly talks down to the reader. Common Sense Forestry by Hans Morsbach covers much of the same material with a clear and concise style and also manages to be far mor informative."
5,Perfect for City Slickers.,"I found this book to be an incredibly valuable asset in the managing of my newly acquired 10 acres of woods. I had no previous experience and didn't read this text until I had owned it for several months. Unfortunately, I had learned the hard way many of the common sense facts the authors share in these pages. It is a well-written and well-documented work that is perfect for those of us who wish to conserve and preserve deciduous woodlands. I have opened mine up as a guide and reference several times after finishing it."
1,No new info here,I was dissappointed in this book as most of the information contained is common knowledge. The same points are often made several times throughout the book and nothing is expanded on. Even a complete novice should look elsewhere for an informative book on the subject.
1,Absolute bunk - This nonsense is just Scientology over easy!,"Do not invest money in this nonsense. I wanted to read reviews but wound up on this guy's ""ranch"" page. I quickly realized their email addresses show up in this guy's ""ranch"" membership forums as well. Basically, he had all his followers write good reviews for this bunk.It's quite ridiculous but highly dangerous material because it's generally stolen from scientology, the words are switched around here and there but they don't even make an effort to disguise the ruse.Shame on this guy."
3,Good,"This CD has some great cuts; Hard Times, Your Mind is on Vacation, and My Favorite Things. There are also some real loosers. I'm glad I have it (for the good stuff)..."
5,Sea Turtles: An Ecological Guide,"Recommended as a resource text for a marine lab weekend on sea turtles, this brightly illustrated book is appropriate for both adult and younger readers."
5,Kokane Brings the FUNK!!!!!,"Great Album with Guest Appearances by Kurupt, Nate Dogg and many MORE!!!! I must have for any Kokane Fan!!!"
1,Not worth the Money!,"I am a homeschooling mother who bought this, to use with the books while reading with my girls. I develop my own cirriculum for school, and I was so excited that someone had made these study guides, so I wouldn't have to. However,this book was extremely disappointing to say the least. It is only 13 pages long with only two pages dedicated to any 5-6 chapters. The 5-10 questions, which were dedicated to the 5-6 chapters were silly, and had no depth to them. There were no other usable parts to the book. There are only 2-3 reproducibles, but they are not worth the cost of the paper to print them. Being an avid Harry Potter lover, as are my girls, this was extremely disappointing. Don't waste your money on it. You would do better to make up your own questions about each chapter and find some free stuff online."
1,Harry Potter does not equal great literature!,"I love the Harry Potter books. I really do. But I never for a moment mistook them for great literature. All of the Harry Potter literature guides are mistaken attempts to teach Harry Potter (Impossible! It is simply a fun book, and fun books cannot be taught!) While looking through this guide, I noticed that it is a pitiful attempt to attach meaning to parts of the story just meant for fun and enjoyment! It offers nothing substantial to build a lesson upon, and I know for a fact that some kids find it not only insubstatial, but boring as well! By all means, read Harry Potter, but don't try to teach it. They just don't mix."
4,IDEAS GALORE!,"Design ideas for gift bags; recipes to fill them. Most recipes contain basic ingredients. I have found that coming up with a ""last minute"" gift is simple with just a quick review of the pages."
2,TOO MUCH STUFF TO BUY,"Apparently I'm the only one who finds this book, while very beautiful, unrealistic in terms of number of items to buy in order to complete a project. For example, the ""Gilded Romantic Bag"" requires THIRTEEN ITEMS to make it as shown. The only items I would have on hand would be the glue gun and ruler. Now, if you intended to decorate only one bag, and didn't mind paying for things that you'd probably never use but once or twice (i.e., gold spray paint, Design Master Glossy Wood Tone Spray, gold heart-shaped charm) it would cost a minimum of fifteen dollars to get all this stuff. As I said, it's a pretty bag, but simply not worth the time and money, at least to me. This is NOT for the crafter who wants to make numerous items...much too expensive and much too time-consuming. I was looking for some cute, quick and simple ideas...something definitely not in this book"
3,Good action. Lots of IPSC open guns.,"Good picture. It was as expected.Something that is not mentioned: The spoken languages are traditional Chinese, Cantonese, and simplified Chinese.Subtitles are in English, simplified chinese, and cantonese.If you like IPSC shooting, you must have this picture."
4,A great non John Woo movie,"The action sequence is very good ,but a little bit short. Of course, this is my personal taste. Also don't expect to see a guy emptying a clip into another in this movie. After all, they shoot race guns with red-dot scopes. Another movie worth watching is The Mission. Both were released in Asia last year, and both were nominated for the category of best editing in the Golden Horse Award."
5,Still making Bieler Broth after over 50 years,"Dr. Bieler was our family doctor until he retired. He was a wonderful, warm and sensitive man. I never felt like I was 'going to see the doctor' when I had an appt as a child. I don't know if it was unusual, but he saw us in his home office in San Juan Capistrano, Southern California. He was a wood carver and made beautiful little bears, one of which he gave me and I treasure it still. Bieler Broth is quite popular now as a liver cleanse, and it really works. I'm so glad this book is still in print as the copy I inherited from my mom is on its last legs."
3,An Early entry into Alternatives,Dr. Bieler treats patients with food not drugs. What a novel idea. But this book is old. Lots more have been written.
1,"Too old, too weird","I got this book becasue of some good reviews but I did not enjoy reading it, by the color code book if you want to know about nutrition."
2,Mediocre performance,"Don't buy this product if your major requirement is vacuuming. It does a really disappointing job. Holding this device to vacuum all corners is a really painful thing. Also the manual is not at all informative; I think they can really do a better job by including some more images along with descriptions. I did not test power source feature for cell phones and laptops, so I can't write about it. Also if you are looking for flash light or emergency light features, it does a decent job."
1,Sorry it didn't work out.,"I thought this combo idea of having a small vacuum, compressor, charger, flashlight, and trouble light all in one package sounded great! It would be a good way to save on too much hardware when we travel across the country in our Travel Van. Much to my displeasure, it would not take a charge. I plugged it in for the necessary 10 hours, then another 10 hours, and another. The only way it would even light the flashlight was to have it on the charger plugged into the wall. Good idea didn't pan out. I had to return it."
1,Really Bad Renderings of Residents Classics,"If you buy this CD, chances are you won't make it through even one complete listening. The only worthwhile thing about the CD is the liner notes written by Penn Jillette. And you can read those for free at http://www.rzweb.net/app/notes/eyesore.html."
4,Daughter loved this game,"I purchased this for my 10yr old daughter [her first gameboy game] and she loved it. It was easiest enough so that she did not become frustrated with it.. and yet hard enough that it took several days to win. Her 12yr old brother [a game addict] even found the game entertaining and enjoyed it as well. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good, family quality, entertaining game."
2,A little fun,"I've played this game before a it's a little boring. After you play it long enough, it kinda gets boring. The computer game is better. When you bark it crushes the evil toy FOR GOOD. The gameboy game only gives you a few seconds to get away. But don't change your mind about buying it because I said it was bad. This is only MY OPINION! You might like it. I've read a lot of good reviews on it."
3,hard to find,"This VHS casette contains the video for hit ""Build a Fire"" and live footage of the band tearing through The Stooges' ""Search and Destroy"" during their 1991 arena heyday. If you're a fan, you should find it."
1,I always wanted to write a review for a LIGHTER...,"yup, right, this is the first review on a lighter. unfortunately I cannot tell you anything about it."
5,Still funny,"Some people think this stuff is silly, but it always makes me laugh. I am starting a dvd collection of varioius movies and old tv shows, this is the perfect addition. Works out to about 5 dollars an episode, can't beat that.I would like to collect all of them, the ones with Shemp Too!"
4,Great Value for Money!,"This is not a Samsonite quality bag, but is wonderful for the price you pay. Had a nice dividor in the middle, which stops all your items falling to the bottom of the bag when you're wheeling it along. Sturdy enough and very convenient. Nice colour and design. Looks classy enough to go with my ""Brics"" green luggage! Highly recommended... Please don't expect it to last as long as a more expensive version, because it won't, but it will do the job for someone who doesn't travel too frequently. Highly recommended!"
2,Rode Hard - Put Up ... well broken,"I travel with 50-70lbs per piece ... so I am hard on my luggage... After a few uses this Delsey crashed hard. The wheels splayed, bending out so that I could not pull the luggage, the handles hardware pulled apart and I had to jimmy the device back together.. Granted, I demand a lot from my luggage... but I would not buy another Desley because they can't take the load."
3,OK Thimble,The thimble was OK. I am a guy with large hands and use it to for upholstering. It was still too small for my finger. My finger goes only about half way in. Anyone know of a larger one?
1,Extra large? Hardly.,"I get that the overwhelming majority of thimble users lack a Y chromosome. But seriously, if an ""extra large"" thimble will only fit on my pinkie (I have average sized hands for a man), what size should I be looking for? ""Super colossal gigantic?"" Ridiculous."
1,"Nice for email, but a terrible phone","1) highest volume setting not loud enough to be heard with the slightest amount of background noise2) no speaker phone3) no voice dialing4) backlighting does not always come on when you start hitting keys.bottom line, if you're a traveling buiseness man, this sorry phone lacks the most important features. Yea it's my fault for not researchihng more thuroughly, but I never imagined a product designed for business professionals would be lacking in the most obvious and essential features. What a disappointment."
1,Help,"If you bay any Blackbery device you also buy a problem. This is good if you make no change and only use to send mails. They do not provide online help or a mail account to make questions. The Desktop software has pour logic and usually makes what is not expected. The help always referrer to the Administrator or to the manual! So, what happen if you would like to do something by your self? Probably you have to spend lot of time reading the whole book. What happen if you do not have an administrator? This shows you the lake of respect for the costumers. This is definitely not a company oriented to final customers, their target is B2B, and so you have to be careful."
5,Sweet streets toys,"I have bought about every building made by sweet streets for my daughter who now is 13 and too old to use them, but because they are made so durable I have held on to them and have other family members such as neices and believe it or not nephews over who love to play with them. There are also play mats that you can purchase to place these on. Your children will enjoy hours of play making these toys invaluable and you may even get a chance to sit for a bit with an uninterupted cup of coffee. High quality, some a bit pricey but will take a beating which make a good hand me down from your children to your grandchilden. I enjoyed many a quiet days when my daughter and friends got out the sweet streets!"
1,ridiculous design,"I can't believe this strainer was ever tested in a kitchen. The handle, while a beautiful color, is far too large and heavy, completely unbalancing the design. As a result, the strainer will not rest atop a measuring cup, as it should (so you can squeeze a lemon into it and measure the juice, for example). Also, the construction was not good as the handle on mine was not securely fastened. But that is a minor point."
1,better for flowers than fish,"do not put a live fish in this tiny bit of water. if you really like the shape, buy some flowers and forgo the fish. unless you like torturing small animals you should really stay away from something this small."
1,Unacceptable,This tank is not a tank at all. Please review your decision when purchasing this. A one gallon bowl or tank is only a couple dollars more and would make your betta happier in the long run.
5,Perfect fit for 2002 Honda CR-V EX,I installed these lamps in 2002 Honda CR-V EX and they fit perfect and work great. Good simple replacement lamps
3,Roughly handled,"The bulb came in the package you see in the listing but the package was crumpled and the grey coating on the end of the bulb was worn off onto the inside plastic package in two spots. bulb works and I guess I'll keep it cause of hassle factor, sure hope its not blinding oncoming traffic (I have no idea what the effect of the worn spots is). This item should not be sold as new given the condition of the packaging."
3,be careful,"WELL, THE SWITCH DOES NOT HAVE LONG ENOUGH STUDS TO HOOK THE WIRES ONTO. ALSO DO NOT TAKE IT APART AS ABOUT 13 PIECES FALL OUT. SOME ARE TINY. TOOK ME 3 HOURS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIT IT BACK TOGETHER BUT I SUCEEDED.WHEW!I WILL HOOK IT IN TO THE WINCH AND SEE HOW IT WORKS. THE OHM METER SAYS IT WILL WORK OK."
4,Works well,"I really don't like this switch, but I choose to purchase it because mine would not make contact any longer. It is rather expensive for what it is, but I just had my Warn winch rebuilt for $68 and another $85 for a switch was still cheaper than buying a new Warn winch. Warning: Do not take it apart, because they are difficult to put back together. The after market remotes are less expensive, but did not like the reviews I was reading about them."
4,"Works fine, easy to install, expensive",The switch was easy to install because I was replacing the same switch. It was expensive but I didn't want to fuss with rewiring a different type of switch.
4,Warn control switch,Switch just like the original switch when new. Works as intended with no problems. Easy to install and easy to operate.
4,Warn Winch Switch,"The switch was packaged well, was easy to install, and is working great (I do think it is somewhat ""pricey"", considering the entire winch assembly is less than $300)"
3,Good but Sloppy,"This book is designed for the IB Math Studies standard level test. It does a good job in covering the integral information, but the book is riddled with typos and mistakes. Many of the answers in the back of the book are wrong, and the spelling errors grow quite tiresome. One might try to find a book that is just as helpful with math, but better with the proofreading."
1,Boring same old story,"my dvd had skips in play back, but the story is predictable if true. some humorin court from a guy with nothing to lose. government looks small & mean (which it is)with how it presents it's case. it now keeps it's trials short & small or slaps terrorist label on people & ships them off shore. longest trial in historythe jury dismissed 20 guys as not guilty to send message, keep it short & sweet."
4,A Crime Court Room Drama with a Human Touch!,If you like court room dramas that have both a crime and comedic element.Vin Diesel and the cast will keep you entertained. I was surprised to see Diesel in a role that showed his acting skills rather than his rough guy skills. I believe it's a well made movie based on a real life court room drama.
1,Not a good product,"I bought ""Find Me Guilty"" as a birthday present for my fiancee. When we set down to watch it the movie would not even read in our dvd or our blueray player. It took several tries for the disk to load. After at least 20 minutes the movie began to play but only a few seconds at a time before it would freeze and ultimately turn off. This was a disappointing purchase."
1,Find Me Guilty/DVD,The version of this DVD was in Italian instead of the English. Extremely disappointed about this error in processing. I would like to be sent the correct version as ordered.
2,Good Fellas Very Light,"Light years behind other mob movies, like Good Fellas, and a terrible view of courtroom reality, still gets 2 stars for trying hard and Vin Deisal's acting. Another one of those make the bad guys look good movies, and got carried around stereotyping the hard-working prosecutor. What was really really bad was the clipped down version of the trial. Another bad trial lawyer movie."
2,What's to like?,"I don't really understand how someone could give this movie a glowing review. It wasn't a BAD movie, definitely, but it was definitely not a GOOD movie by any stretch of the imagination. Vin Diesel was good and so was Peter Dinklage. Other than that, there wasn't much acting going on. And the script jumps around too much to really make anything clear as to what's going on with the trial. The movie draws out (much like the trial) and you can't really see a connection with anything. They might as well have just made this an A & E special if they just wanted to highlight some funny things that Jackie DeNorsio said in his trial... but this definitely isn't worthy of a 2 hour movie.The directing is pretty boring which doesn't help the movie progress. Also, the cinematography is bland. Don't check this movie out. It's kind of a waste of 2 hours of your life."
2,Find me a better story,"Other reviewers have described the plot, so I will skip that part. First - I am a big Vin Diesel fan. The story starts out with some action but quickly mires in a courtroom setting. I had nothing invested in these characters. You like Vin's character because he is funny and has some angst going on. But how they got to this landmark case and why - all back story.I think this story would have been better told in a mini-series format. (But then the A- list people wouldn't have done it). The first 2 hours would be showing us their dirty dealings and then subsequent arrest. The 2nd two hours could have been the trial.As much as I like ""talking"" films - those with dialogue and not a lot of action - this one just didn't deliver. It was - as another reviewer stated - a vehicle for Vin to show his more serious dramatic side.The hair piece rivaled the one that Sean Connery in ""Hunt for Red October"". It was good to see Peter Dinglage - loved him in ""The Station Agent""."
4,Vin Diesel acting instead of blowing stuff up...,"Wow, it's Vin Diesel actually acting instead of just blowing stuff up. A refreshingly straightforward mafia/courtroom drama, sort of a Sopranos episode without the flashbacks, dream sequences, and psychological pretensions. True, the bad guys are too good and the good guys are too bad -- but you'll definitely be on the edge of your seat by the time the verdict is read. They don't really make 'em like this much anymore... well done! (Interestingly, there's very little sex and violence by today's standards, but all the profanity earns Find Me Guilty an R rating anyway.)Grade: B+"
1,It arrived broken,"This product arrived broken and when I requested a replacement, they would only send me a refund and lead me to believe (via email only) that the product didn't always survive the shipping process. So unless you are picking one up directly from the assembly line, steer clear of this product."
5,"A Classic -- It Will Move You, to Dance...and to Tears","""I won't let you down. I will not give you up. Gotta have some faith in the sound. It's the one good thing that I've got..."" Georgie really redeems himself with this one. He doesn't even appear in the videos to promote the album. THIS is what George wanted to do in the first place, but he had to please record execs with the Wham! stuff and the ""I want your sex."" But this is an essential album for any music lover. George plays a lot of the instruments. Good bass, especially on Freedom '90 and the upright bass on Cowboys and Angels...and when you listen to Mother's Pride...keep the tissues nearby. It's a real tear jerker. It's Class A music. Listen, WITHOUT PREJUDICE!"
5,The best album he has written!,I believe this to be his most honest and vulnerable album. George Michael is a legend.
5,"The Best, Five Stars time 2","I absolutely love this album and I have them all. I am completely and utterly a George Michael fan. Love it, love it, love it. After the Wham days, people were asking, where's the substance? Is it there? Well, ease your mind. This album is some of the best music you'll get and I'll never know why it didn't get better billing. It's quite varied and shows interesting exploration. Beautiful song writing that fits his sultry delivery like a glove. The sexiest glove you've ever seen. I have tons of music and this one is one that would be on my list of picks if I was to be stranded on a desert isle for a long, long time. It's beautiful and has something to say."
5,One of my top 10 albums ever.,"This album came out when I was still in high school; I loved Wham as a teeny-bopper but had hated Faith with a passion, so I ignored this album at first. But then a friend who was a huge GM fan played the cassette for me in my car, and I was hooked.I replaced my cassette with the cd while in college (when cd's were first coming out, and OMG does that date me or what!) but it had disappeared into the mists of time after multiple moves. Then for some reason last week I decided to download the album, and I've been playing it pretty much non-stop ever since.The next album, Older, is also a wonderful album with a similar jazzy/soul feel, but this is the one for me. Every song is terrific in its own way, nothing is a throw-away or a filler. Spend the money on this album, you won't be disappointed."
5,fun and soulful,"The songs are great. There is a little bit of something for everyone-a little bit of dance, rock, reggae, jazz, love songs. It is still a great album many moons later."
3,pretty good,"this is a very talented Artist.Geroge Michael is a Good writer,Producer,Instrumentalist&vocalist.this album has moments such as Praying for time,Cowboys&Angels,and his great cover of Stevie Wonder's they WOn't Go WHen I Go.those songs stand out.but with no Grooves hurt this disc.he needed a Dance song on here.but this is a Pretty good disc by a very Underrated Artist."
3,"listen without prejeduce, and listen with big speakers to this hot ""s#%t""","awesome, couldn't have been better"
5,"After 10 years, still one of my favorites","I bought this album when I was in high school and spent an entire year listening to it. I recently discovered it again and am thrilled that I still enjoy his songs as much as I did 10 years ago. It really is great album, one of the best I've ever listened to."
5,The title says it all,"The title captures the whole essence of the album. Those fettered by prejudice will never be able to enjoy the music here, those having an open mind will discover the true genius of this music. It's got variety of styles, yet unity of content. It's got a mood and it's got dedication. And it has the best singing you can ever get. So freshen your mind and freshen your ears, shape up and Listen With Headphones."
4,"""Cowboys and Angels"" is a masterpiece","I don't know that I would still own this album if it weren't for ""Cowboys and Angels,"" one of the great songs of the 1990s. Having never thought much of George Michael as a lyricist, I wasn't fully prepared for the impact of that song. It seems to me one of the most honest songs ever recorded."
4,Thank you,"No problems - I am trying to find one of these rabbits bigger than this, but less than 12"" - we lost one we had for our son, not exactly sure how big it was but less than 12"". Bought it in a department store right before his birth in Seattle - don't live there anymore and can't find the right size rabbit anywhere. We ordered these as gifts for friends having children, simple and nice - everyone's happy, everyone wins!!"
5,Mini snake,"Can't go wrong on this purchase, good price, free shipping at Amazon. We use this product every sunday as a patch cord from our side units to our mixer. This cord is made by Hosa which is a name brand you can trust."
2,Good only for historical purposes,"This book has it's moments, such as ""God's Judgement for White America"" which speaks of divine revenge for the crimes against Black Americans, but too much of this reflects the period when Malcolm was parroting (his own admission) the cuckoo-patch teachings of Elijah Muhammad for the benefit of the ignorant. ""The Black Man's History"" is filled with utter madness about Blakc mad scientists creating White people, ad nauseum. Good only for historical purposes. Read the real, sensible stuff from when Malcolm had the sense to cut loose from Elijah's mess, such as ""Malcolm X Speaks,' ""By Any Means Necessary"" etc."
4,Good but poorly edited,"I'm a fan of Wilbur Smith's writing and have read several of his books. I realized that I had begun the Courntey series nearly a decade ago and that I began with book 3. Realizing I missed the two initial books I purchased them on my kindle and plan on reading through the rest of the series. I love the books, the stories are great, my only complaint is that the kindle version is so poorly edited. Often instead of a question mark is the letter r or words such common in the book as Africa are even spelled wrong. Other than the editing errors the books are good."
5,Sound of Thunder,"Great book by my favorite author Wilbur Smith. It is the second in a series of books,would recommend reading the first one ""When the Lion Feeds"" before getting into this one. Entire series is amazing. Story is of a family dynasty in turn of the century South Africa and follows all the turmoils of what the country must endure. This particular book is set just before the Boer War,during the war, and what happens after with the family and the country. Excellent book!!"
2,Not Wilbur Smith's Best,"This book is not as gripping as the usual Wilbur Smith novel. It is the story of a dysfunctional branch of the Courteney family living in South Africa around 1900. Somehow the blood and guts of civil war isn't as interesting as other Smith narratives. Other books have lots of fascinating and well-researched context material that make them interesting and separate them from other ""pot boilers."" But ""The Sound of Thunder"" is mainly just about people hating and harming each other in irrational ways. The characters are all improbable, the coincidences that bring them together stretch credibility beyond the breaking point, and the action is often senseless and leads nowhere. One interesting dimension of Smith -- exploring the essence of Africa -- is trivialized in this book. In summary, it's not Wilbur Smiths best book by a long shot."
3,Saga Order,"What is the order of the books in the Courtney Family Saga?? Would like to read, but don't know where to start?"
5,Favourite Author,"Very enjoyable, Wilbur is still my favourite author. When you read his books you really feel a part of it."
5,Excellent,"My daughter has trouble concentrating in school. I got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work. The best thing about it is that I don't have to tell her to use it because she loves it. I told her it's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own. This is as close as I'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age, plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop.For children who don't have a hard time in school, this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what I needed to help me help her learn. I just wish I could find an adapter."
1,"No LCD Back Light, Can't see the screen",The screen is so dark I am worried it is going to damage my daughter's eyes. I would not recommend it. It is unusable due to dark screen (it is not back-lit and the contrast adjusment does not help).
4,Touch Tablet Review Great Product,"We bought these for our boys ages 7 and 8 and they LOVE them. Just took a road trip and this was the best thing on earth to keep the boys occupied for hours. Wish VTech would make some cartridges that are even more challenging for older kids. My only concern is Vtech website says suggested retail is $99.00, Toysrus sells for that, although Amazon is outragiously high priced! I would NOT pay as much as Amazon charges for it, its WAY above suggested retail! We also have the Nitero Notebook Jr for my youngest son and he LOVES it. I will continue to buy VTech products till my kids totally outgrow them. Daughter has a very basic laptop from Vtech as well for preschoolers."
3,the best laptop,the laptop is very educational for kids learning how to use computer for the first time
1,Can't see the screen!,"We really can't find out how good this product is--we can't see the screen. In a darkened room, one can barely see what is happeneing, in a light room, forget about it. I don't know if this is defective or not. My grandson didn't see any directions or warranty info so I doubt that we can return it. It sounded like it would be a very good learning tool."
4,My eight year old enjoyed it.,I bought this game for my eight year old son and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I noticed is that he played through all the levels really quickly. So the game is pretty short. He goes back and replay the levels so for him it is okay.
3,just ok,"this is the worst lego game of all, but i got 100% on all the others so i figured wth i'll do this too. dont get me wrong its not bad but they made it a shooter and lego games are lego games, to be compared to other kiddy games, but when you make a shooter well you get compared with shooters and it gets boring. i did finish it with 100% but it wasn't as fun as the others."
1,Boring repetitive gameplay,"Received this game as a gift. ""Boring repetitive gameplay"" pretty much summarizes this game. Graphics is poor by today's standard. No story line to speak off. And did I mention the gameplay is repetitive and boring?"
3,Not quite what I thought,"Although the prints are nice and the size just right , I somehow thought they were mounted and ready to hang. Unfortunatly I won't be using them as I would have to frame and mount them at additional cost"
2,The wrong David Hawkins,This Author is not David Hawkins of the Relationship Doctor. I made three expensive purchases of this MD's new age writings thinking it was the Christian psychologist of the same name. You need to differentiate between the two and I am going to have bonfire.
1,TRUST ME.... IGNORE ANY POSITIVE RATINGS!!!!,"No word is powerful enough in the english language to describe this Turd. This whole movie is the equivalent to Jim Carrey shouting ""LIKE A GLOVE"" in Ace Ventura 2.... All the director does here is flaccidly create similar scenarios with absolutely ZERO heart or artistic leverage. The movie falls on it's face within the first minute. Anyone who said this was a good movie is likely the same person who enjoys monster truck rallies and WWE Wrestling matches.This movie was a GLORIOUS INSULT to the beauty of the original.Also, WHY? did we need to see the 'Saints' showering naked?????? Who is your key-demographic for this film?????? Director: Please let me slap you in the face."
1,deserves neg. stars,"did a high schooler write the script for this?this ""movie"" was a combination of music videos and late night cheesy cable movies.the head villian was judd nelson playing a boston mob boss(gives you an idea about the movie). do yourself a favor and rewatch the first one a couple of times instead."
2,joke of a sequel,"There are some sequels that rehash the original and then there are other sequels that diverge greatly from the original. This one diverges greatly from the first movie and for some reason they took this sequel is the wrong direction, making it a joke of the original and really hard to watch. Having enjoyed the original immensely, this sequel does the original an injustice. If you liked Boondock Saints, steer clear of this one and just hope there is third movie which redeems this one."
1,Trying to pretend this never happened,"I was skeptical how they could possibly follow the first one being such a classic. Well, I never anticipated it would have been this bad...so bad I had to write a review. All of it felt forced and vulgar for the sake of being vulgar...the acting was cheesy and they tried too hard to rekindle some nostalgia from the first one...it just made this unoriginal with no development amongst any of the characters..the new characters were annoying at best and the dialogue with the brothers was dull and full of lame one-liners. I almost had to watch the first one right after to try and forget that this sequel never happened. I advise to stop at the first. I can't believe we all waited 10 years for this letdown."
1,Wow -What Happened??,"I knew something was terribly different/wrong from the moment there was dialog. I thought to myself ""why didn't they stick to the original director & scriptwriter?"" Well I was shocked to find out that it was done by the same guy (Troy Duffy) - I can't for the life of me understand why then the script & the acting was so horrendous. Anyone who wrote a good review on this -sorry excuse of a movie- is either (A) Part of the movie and desperately wants to score some residuals. (B) Someone who cant tell the difference between a low budget B movie that comes with bad/over acting & brainless dialog. If you're wondering why William Devoe chose not to be in this movie - watch the movie- all will be revealed."
5,Saints Be Praised!,"I skipped the theatrical released and postponed renting it for months because of the negative reviews given by so many people claiming to have been fans of the original Boondock Saints. I'm no fan of bad sequels. In fact, I'm generally no fan of sequels, period. But I finally got talked into renting BDS II and I ordered a copy online that same night. Now I want to hunt down all those haters and go all ""Saints"" on them for having denied me this pleasure for so long! This was a fantastic movie! It is one of the few sequels that is every bit as good as its original! It was pure BDS start to finish.If you truly understand the Saints you already know that it's an over-the-top celebration of raw, uncut, testosterone-overloaded, blue-collar masculinity that doesn't take itself seriously. I don't see how anyone who didn't like this movie could call himself a MAN with a straight face!"
3,Boondock Saints II,"OK let me tell you this, the 1st one is my FAVORITE movie. However, be prepared, the 2nd one is no where near as good as the 1st (sadly) They tried too much to be the same as the 1st one & quite frankly I can say I liked it, but it was definitely NOT as good as the 1st & most likely will not be watching it again for a good long while. I know they're making the 3rd already & will probably buy that one too just so I have the set, but am hoping it's better than the 2nd (crossing fingers). Would recommend you rent it before actually going out & buying it & than making the decision of whether or not it's worth the purchase. Don't buy into these folks who say it's the best movie they've ever seen & all that- I'm probably the biggest fan of the 1st & was truly disappointed ....Hope this helps...PEACE"
2,It Should Have Been Better,"Just watched the movie; was a big fan of Saints I. It pains me to say that while it's watchable, it's ultimately cartoonish and overdone. The brothers' relationship is taken for granted, and they are moved through obligatory gunplay like pieces on a board. The humor between them and their Mexican sidekick is phony and overdone, and his character is never clear. And Peter Fonda's accent sucks. He obviously didn't take much time preparing for his role, as limited as it was. Don't get me wrong -- the movie wasn't terrible, but it could -- and should -- have been so much better. I watch the original every so often. I don't think I'll watch this one again."
4,"Action, Action, Action","If you like lots of shooting and killing then you will probably like this movie. I think the first Boondock Saints movie was a little better, but this one was good too. The only things I didn't care for in this movie were the flash forward scenes where the Saints would imagine how their plan was going to work. It never worked like they thought it would so all that extra film was kind of a waste of time. The ending tends to make you think there will be a third movie and if there is that should be enough."
4,"Action, Action, Action","This one is slow to get going, but the second half was better than the first. The boys lookalot older and not so ""boyish"". Great ending. I do think the first one was better, but this wasenjoyable."
3,Justice as a fantasy!,"The acting is great. The plot is better than the original. The theme the same: taking the law into your own hands, playing God, and meating out justice - however deserved - your way. The violence alone is a benediction on the idea of too many people with too many guns. If this whole theme were'nt so real and palitable then this film would not be so much a fantasy then as a documentary."
4,BDSII,"This is a good movie to put it simply. It's not in the same caliber as the first Boondock Saints, but it didn't disappoint. Decent plot, decent acting, only thing i could gripe about would be the soundtrack. It just didn't seem to fit. What's nice is that it goes into the history of their father and brings more background like that in. Also, keeping most the characters from the first movie was a highlight."
5,Good watch,I bought this dvd since I already had the first one. Love a movie with a lot of action. Can't go wrong with this.
1,Stupidest movie ever!!!,"I never seen a non-sense movie like this one. The first one was very good, and that's why i bought the second dvd as well. But it was a total disappointment. Don't spend two hours of your life watching this movie."
5,Just like described,"This product was excellent. The quality of the disc, as well as the case, were exactly as described. The product arrived in a timely manner...it's great!"
2,not what I wanted,I wanted the soundtrack but recieved the movie DVD instead.I was shopping for the soundtrack but recieved the movie DVD instead
1,Here's a taste of the writing in the movie,"FBI Agent Eunice Blum(played by Julie Benz doing a terrible Southern accent) tells the 3 fumbling cops ""Im so smart that I make smart people look retarded""I think that cringeworthy line should be enough to deter anyone from making the same mistake I did.i.e watch this awful awful awful movie!There is so much that is awful about this movie that I wouldnt be able to stop.If mindless ineffective violence,pathetic attempts at John Woo style action montages, nonsensical plot, terrible acting,lame femme fatales, male nudity(but no female) is your cup of tea then surely this movie is for you.If you want to watch a vigilante movie ,stick with Death Wish 1,2 and Dirty Harry.Really, no need to bother with anything else including the original BS!"
1,TERIBLE,I think this may be the worst movie i have ever seen. Following a great movie like the first boodock saints this is terrible.
1,CINEMA FAIL,"I wish I could give this movie zero stars....just a horrific mess. I've seen better movies at 4am on Cinemax. What a disappointment. Terribly written, cheesy plot (if you call it that), poorly acted...just a gong show."
3,Nothing compares to the original,The 1st Boondock Saints is my favorite movie of all time so it's hard to compare to that but I was pleasantly surprised with the 2nd. I love Julie Benz and thought she did a great job and I like how they left the ending open for a 3rd.
2,A definite let-down for fans,"Julie Benz was sexy and her character was fun; a great addition. But while I like Clifton Collins Jr., his role just didn't fit well with the story; so a good actor, but a lousy role.The first Boondock Saints had flaws, but it was classic, and I have watched and enjoyed it many times. This one I enjoyed watching once, especially Benz, but it just isn't going to be a classic and although I bought the DVD, it will be a long time before I watch it again.All in all, rent it, don't buy it."
5,THE SAINTS ROCK!,I think Boondock Saints is one of those movies you will either love or hate. No inbetween. I loved them both. Non-stop action and the realistic relationship between the two brothers (getting into a fight in the middle of a job) make this a great movie. Those of you who remember Billy Connelly from his stand up days will get a kick out of seeing him in this role.
5,Awesome,"I was a huge fan of the first BDS, and while this one was alot more over the top i enjoyed the comedy angle."
3,Not as Good as the First,"Overall, this was a horrible follow up to The Boondock Saints. I don't want to give out any spoilers, so I'll try to stay general. This sequel almost seemed like more of an attempted comedy than anything else. While the MacManus brothers were as excellent as before, the new cast of characters (some former ones return as well) is weak and hokey. There are just enough interesting tidbits to keep you watching, but in the end I personally felt the movie didn't even attempt to meet my expectations. There are rumors that a third movie is being discussed. Let me just say that this one was so disappointing that unless the writers/director really put there heart and soul into its creation, it's best to not continue the Saints' story."
2,what the F***?,"The first movie was so good! This movie had such bad acting in it. If you loved the first movie and feel an obligation to see this movie for that reason, just go in expecting nothing."
2,Bad Sequel,The movie had alot of potential but in my opinion was directed very poorly. Alot of parts in the movie were corny for the adult audience. Do not have high hopes for a good sequel.
2,bad movie choice,"A lot of violence, the attempts at humor were lame, the plot is week. This movie was a disappointment. Luckily I only spent $1.00 renting it through redbox."
4,well....it's not exactly like the first one.,"All of you who were very critical of the 2nd movie were probably expecting the same carbon copy of the first movie. The bottom line is: these are two entirely separate movies hence the number 2. Nothing is ever the same. No cd is ever the same. No movie sharing the same name should be the same. I guess it's the natural progression....or de-evolution of things. The movie is good in it's own right. The sterotypical mexican was a bit of a twist but not much off from Rocco from the first flick. The replacement for Agent Smecker was....sexier, but nonetheless from the same vein as Willem Dafoe. The history of Il Duce was interesting.....anyways. I firmly believe that this movie, though extremely different from the first one, is still good in it's own right."
4,A solid sequel to a legendary film,"Anyone who likes the first film seems to ""really"" like it, so creating a sequel that can live up to the first is a challenge. I'll admit that the first 10 to 15 minutes are slow and uninspiring, but if you hold out, you will find out why many people have enjoyed it. This film doesn't seem to have the pacing of the first (this ones a roller coaster ride - amazing at some parts and slow as can be at others), but i'd totally say that this one is worth a watch. Keep in mind this is a 10 year old sequel, but if you go in knowing or even watch the first film before (to remind yourself how ridiculous the first is) you should thoroughly enjoy it."
1,Just plain bad.,"My wife and I were eagerly waiting for this to be released and finally watched it, or part of it, a few nights ago. After thoroughly enjoying the original, we lasted only 15-20 minutes through this weak excuse of a sequel. No stars would have been a better rating. VERY disappointed."
2,Suprisingly Bad,"Dialogue, acting, direction, sets, lighting, music... it's all bad in this one. RENT if you have to see this.(2 stars because it was fun to see the actors again and think about how good the first one was)"
1,horrible,I don't understand the 5 star reviews at all... this movie was a waste of time for me. Spare yourself.
4,The boondock saints came back,I definitly prefered the first one over this one but it's still a good movie. It;s worth my money and I'll watch it again
5,Boon Dock Saints II,"Boondock Saints II is one of the few sequels that is as good, if not better than the first. While we lost a couple of the memorable characters of the first film, the new characters more than held their own. The plot is unusual and can be controversial, however, in our family, that caused healthy discussion. There is comedy, violence, human error, very colorful characters, religious beliefs, a look at media power and much food for thought and discussion. This is not a film for younger kids, but it's a treat for older kids and adults.We enjoyed it so much we purchased the two films and we'll be spending St Patrick's Day eating traditional Irish food and watching the Boondock Saints I and II. We've e-mailed the director/writer and asked that he go with a third. I highly recommend this ."
5,Amazing Video,This movie is part two of the cult classic Boondock Saints movie series. I LOVE the series and am a super fan of vigil-anti movies like these. I would recomend that anyone who loves action or vigilante movies NEED'S to own this movie. They also need to own the first edition of the series watching the first movie is essential to understand what is going on in part two.
4,Great movie.,"Not as good as the first, but yet still entertaining. These boys are great. I look forward to the third installment when released."
3,Entertaining,"It is a decent movie, the only reason I gave it less than 4 stars is because I enjoyed the first one so much. This is a good movie, just not as good as the first one. If you loved/liked the first one watch this one. It is worth the rental."
5,Boondock Saints,"The Boondock Saints II a high action packed movie that left off where it ended in the first movie, excellent movie, brought this a christmas gift for my brother in law and found out he had brought it at the exact same time as I did.I would recommend this movie this movie if you like action packed movies."
1,An insult to the original!!!!,"Oh its just awful! The first Boondock Saints is a great movie, great quotes, great action, great story, just great! BS II? Its just that, b.s. It's SO cheesy and cliche. The acting is terrible; its almost embarrassing to admit being a fan of the original movie. The worst part is how they replaced the detective character. The same quirky almost idiot savant of detective work who listens to classical music & sees things that NO ONE else even noticed. But wait! They made her a smoking hot female. Maybe then no-one would notice that it's the exact same character. If you like the original movie PLEASE do not watch II. Leave your memory unblemished and remember the saints as what they were."
1,Waste of time,"Wow. This movie was sooo bad that I had to write a review. I really liked the first movie but this is garbage. The plot was hardly even there until the end and even then it didn't make much sense and the boondock boys hardly had any lines at all. They seemed to be there for a token quality. The writing was absolutely horrible and the acting was atrocious. Most of the movie should have been cut out. The acting was so bad with the lame jokes and one liners, ugh. Reminds me of Transformers 2 all over again. Awful awful awful. I want my hour and half back."
1,Disappointed.,"I was disappointed by the sequel although hopeful that it would continue on with the same energy of last movie. I thought female replacement of FBI detective to be a cheesy representation of a female authority figure, trite with simplistic generalizations."
1,Just bad,Duffy is a one hit wonder. Terrible writing from start to finish. The acting was very spotty as was the cinematography. Why was this movie even greenlit?
2,The Boondock Saints have Lost Their Way,"The Boondock Saints II had the potential to be a very good movie. I was sorely disappointed. No longer is it good vs. evil. It's about the Saints' reputation, the father's resignation to his fate, and retribution all the way around. Really.I did love Julie Benz as Agent Eunice Bloom. Her portrayal is priceless. There are some great scenes that are classic. For instance, the ""f-ing rope"" comes in handy again and more falling into the scene is involved.If you watch this movie knowing that it is not up to par with the first, perhaps you'll enjoy it more. By the way, what did Sean Patrick Flanery do to his face?!?"
1,Developmentally disabled cinema,"I'm glad to see that Hollywood is reaching out to the developmentally disabled community, by employing mentally challenged directors, script writers and actors to produce movies of a caliber that is easily comprehensible to people of a genetically predetermined low IQ and limited understanding. Obviously, the movie would be intolerable to an audience of normal intelligence, but its constant shooting, non-existent plot, dopey posturing and incoherent, meaningless dialogue are enough to keep an audience of low-functioning mental incompetents occupied for two hours. So again, kudos to Hollywood for recognizing a previously underserved audience. And to Troy Duffy: You're a winner! Sean Patrick Flanery: Yay for you! Norman Reedus: You win the prize!"
3,Blu-Ray Review,A better sequel than Smokin Aces but not too much better. Overall it is more comical than anything else. A dumb script that Troy Duffy thinks is good. Blu-Ray quality is very good. The movie is no where near as good as the first one was.
2,"I'd like to say I like it, but...","I'd like to say I like Boondock Saint II, but i just bought the metal case special edition DVD and i cant get it out of the damn ring thats holding it down and i dont want to break the movie. What the hell do i do?"
1,WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,Loved the 1st Boondock Saints but this was the worst movie I have ever seen! Atrocious writing and acting that was (I am hoping) trying to be camp but came across as high school amateurish. My previous worse movie ever was Hang Up or Hanging Up - a piece of dreck starring Meg Ryan and that blonde chick from Friends - Boondock Saints 2 is actually much much worse than that.Save yourself the money and time and just stare at a wall for an hour and a half - your life would be more enriched than sitting through this POS.
1,SKIP THIS CRAP!,"There's a reason why no one wanted this movie made - IT SUCKS!! Troy Duffy is a total idiot! This movie doesn't even fall into the same category as the first. The acting is horrible, the script is complete garbage...one of the worst movies made!!!"
1,JUNK,"I don't normally write reviews but the one is so bad I can't help it! You people who gave it 4-5 stars are on dope. Don't waste your time unless you think vulgar for the sake of being vulgar and using the ""F"" word unnecessarily every other line is cool. The action sequences are dull: the 1st angle shows the boondock boys shoot, the subsequent angle shows the bad guys fall, ... rinse, wash, repeat. Every shootout??? (did the bad guys even shot back?) scene was done the same way. Agree with all the negative reviews."
3,Yuck,"This movie failed at what made the first Boondock Saints great. The corny country chick and the goofy sidekick were so cheesy I couldn't even bare watching them. If there is a third movie, I hope they've been killed off or something because they are absolutely terrible."
3,boondock saints 2,"The sequel to the Boondock Saints movie is not as good,but it is not bad.It is pretty fair,actually.If you like Sean Patrick Flanery,and Norman Reedus,you will be ok with this movie.It is vastly better than some of the other films they've appeared in...believe me...and for the ladies,they both will appear in a shower scene...(yes,indeed)."
2,Not what was listed,Several of the options on the DVD were not available whe I tried to look at then. The movie alone was good.
4,Classic,"Not as good as the first, but still a classic Boondock Saints. Here's hoping the 3rd comes out soon, can't wait."
2,I hoped for more...,"Maybe it's just me but this movie felt like a cheap, recycled version of the first. I'm astounded by how many people feel this is just as good if not better than the first movie. It makes me wonder if a lot of today's fans of the movie actually got why the first was so great. This sequel had a couple interesting things going for it like the ending and our new fbi liason is pretty entertaining and easy on the eyes. Aside from that, you aren't getting anything new, original, etc that wasn't already done in the first and done well. To say the least, I was pretty disappointed which sucks because I had high hopes."
1,If you loved the first movie do yourself a favor and don't watch this !!!,I consider Boondock Saints (the first movie) one of my top five flicks. Like many others I could not way to see All saints day.... I wish I would have.This was the biggest piece of rat turd I have ever seen. EVERYTHING was wrong with this film here's a breif list to startThe acting was terribleSean Patrick Flannery has you guessing if its really him do to some TERRIBLE plastic surgery (no joke I checked the back of the DVD 3 times to make sure and am still sketchy about it)The script - embarrassingThe music - HorriblePlot- there was one?This movie sucked 5 minutes in and continued straight to the end .Seriously I can't believe this movie is allowed to exist. I also can't believe that it was the same director and actors as the first.I cannot express how awful this film was . PLEASE if you loved the first movie DO NOT WATCH this it will ruin it for you.
1,Don't Watch This Movie,"I was highly disappointed with this movie. The first one was good, but this second one really ruined it for me. It's very juvenile and the story was bad beyond belief. The acting is hambone (some worse than others) and isn't true to the characters from the first one. I watched the movie because I liked the actors, but after watching this movie I like them less. Too bad."
5,"Great Movie, decent price","As always, Amazon offers movies, even new movies, at good prices. As for the movie, it's not as good as the first one, but what sequel is? It's still vastly entertaining, with most of the original cast in addition to ""the boys"" as they return to Boston to avenge the killing of a priest after a long time in hiding. The story progression was very similar to the original film, with enough new material to keep it from feeling like déjà vu. I was concerned about Rocko's ""replacement"" initially, I feared that his ethnicity would be ""overdone"", but it never occurred to me again, Clifton Collins Jr. put in a solid performance as the comic relief, being given a slew of fabulous lines. Julie Benz is amazing as the sultry-yet-tough southern belle FBI agent sent in to investigate the first murder, and supposedly track down the Saints. It's a pity we had to wait 10 years for this, but it was worth the wait. Great action, great story."
5,Awseome!,"It's always hard to watch a sequal when the first is one of my favorites, but this is a wonderfully done True part 2 and it comes close to being as good as the first"
3,"Good to see the boys back together, but not the quality of Saints #1","Good enough and great to see the boys back in action, but nowhere near the movie Saints #1 was. I'd buy it again, just to have the set."
5,it's great,"far as i've been with amazon,i've bought items and so on, it have been worth the business and i think i will do still more. thanks wilie"
1,cheap product and poor customer service,"I purchased this jacket as a birthday gift for a friend. It arrived quickly however, there was a tear in the interior lining. The overall quality was fair. In an attempt to contact Hot Leathers, during business hours, I was unable to contact anyone.An email was sent to Hot Leathers to obtain an RMA to return the defective product. The customer service rep responded via email and was impossibly rude and never once apologized for the product being defective. I was told it woul be two weeks before UPS would pick up my order and would not receive my credit until the product was received by Hot Leathers.I requested that UPS immeadiately pick up my order so my credit could be expedited. I was told that I should send it back myself if the time line wasn't acceptable! At my expense! It will be thee-four weeks before I receive my money back.In the future, I will not purchase from this vendor. The jacket was not made well and the service was just as unsatisfactory."
5,A Taste of Lebanon,The books arrived in brand new condition and were sent on an expedited basis. Thank you.
4,Features recipes for authentic home cooking,"Lebanese food is delicious, varied, and nutritious. It offers something for every palate and every budget. This book features a tempting array of traditional family recipes, from simple everyday fare to special occasion dishes. The author thoughtfully provides serving suggestions for many of the dishes described. Although some of the recipes require lengthy preparation or cooking times, most are not complicated to make, and almost all of the ingredients are readily available.Also recommended: ""Recipes and Remembrances from an Eastern Mediterranean Kitchen: A Culinary Journey through Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan,"" by Sonia Uvezian. Every lover of Middle Eastern food should own this unique and extraordinary cookbook."
2,Adequate Starting Book,"This book is a place to start at best. The main part of Middle Eastern cook that I find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices. This book calls for dried spices at times. The dishes don't produce the food that I remember eating growing up with my family. The book is not a total loss, however. The spinach pies are acceptable. There are many other books out there that I would recommend first!"
2,unusable!,"I bought this book because i love cooking and love arabic food.the recipes in the book are good but the problem is that even if followed very carefully,the meals do not come out.they are always eighter undercooked, overcooked or just plain flavorless.The cooking times and temperatures are always off!Worst cookbook i ever bought!I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because a few of the salads and beverages were ok,the rest is a waste!"
3,Basics of Lebanese Cuisine for Western Tastes,"The basics of Lebanese cuisine are presented in this cookbook including kibbi, kafta, yogurt, hummous, baklava, tabouleh, baba gannoush, and many others. Many of the recipes in this book present ideas on how to use these staples of Lebanese cuisine in a variety interesting and different ways. Many of the recipes have been modified for Western tastes, and a few would be unrecognizable in Lebanon (Sloppy Joe Pita Pockets or Pita Burritos!). None of the recipes are particularly complex (except perhaps some of the pastries). There are quite a few of what I would consider to be filler recipes in this cookbook to round out the book. The reason that I rated this book at only three stars is that there really isn't much to it. Once you get past the traditional Lebanese basics, that's pretty much it. A great introduction to Lebanese flavors and Lebanese cooking, but you will be quickly left looking for more."
4,Exceptional leads but an unexceptional supporting cast,"May be I am being a little unfair in my sweeping statement of these episodes. It is just so clear to me that Mr Culp and Mr Cosby were so in tune with each other and at the peak of their game that any woodeness which is natural with bit part players is exaserbated. Having said that I loved the episode An American Empress because the enigmatic France Nuyen was fantastic in it as she was brilliant and engaging in every episode that she starred in. As someone who has yet to see San Francisco these episodes are like a Tourist Brochure of where to go and what to see. Tag your it is a particular favourite of mine because of Scotty and Kelly's hippy disguise and the interaction with each other and the shop owner. On the whole these are definitely not the best I Spy episodes, but because the show was exceptional in every sense of the word this statement of mine is not an inditement on these four episodes which are still very entertaining."
3,"Fake crowd noises-NOT a good start, fellas...","First off...this was a gift, and YES, I did have it on my Wish List. MAJOR PET PEEVE DEPT. The crowd cheering has DEFINITELY been sonically enhanced, to beef up the enthusiasm for this poorly-attended outdoor concert. Sometimes the fake crowd cheering gets in the way of the performance. It's so funny -- they tried to make it sound like a hugE, wild cheering audience, when instead, when the camera pans the small crowd, what you see are a few folks singing along, looking lit, while others look like they're thinking, ""Who ARE these guys?"" What can ya do? Almost EVERY DVD/Video you get these days has been doctored -- trust me on this...I do give these guys credit for still making music... why deny your passions? Nature's Way is one of my all-time fave tunes, for sure.Document and sell your goods, just give us the real thing next time..."
3,Honest Review,First of all I have been a SPIRIT fan since the late sixties and was thrilled to get Any music of theirs on DVD. First off if the people doing this video took the time to do it right this DVD would have been pretty good. The performance was good as was the picture quality but the crowd noise at times did get in the way of the music. The sound quality was at times poor because the sound would fade in and out along with the crowd noise. The concert was way too short and John Locke is not on this video (keyboards) and he never played bass. If you are truly a SPIRIT fan like I am then get the DVD because thats the only way your gonna see Randy California and Ed Cassidy which still plays a pretty good drum for his age. If your not a true fan you might want to pass this DVD up.
3,Randy still with us in... Spirit,"Almost all these bad reviews are accurate. The sound of the band is badly mixed, the audience responce is dubbed, and way to loud. BUT...just to see RANDY and Ed brings back so many memories of the shows that I was fortunate to catch ohh so long ago. I am glad I stumbled upon this DVD, had no idea it existed and outside of a couple of old videos, from some ancient TV shows I don't have any video by these guys. Once again not for everyone, but I enjoyed it."
1,big letdown........,"although this movie was filmed quite well, the sound quality is very poor. completely unacceptable. only dolby 2 channel is available, but even that is recorded so poorly, the dvd is unwatchable. vocals are muffled, and bassy, while instruments are barley audible. the sound quality makes this dvd useless.save your money, please"
3,Jade East Cologne,This was not the Jade East I was hoping for. This has a great fragrance to it but does not have that sweet fragrance that it had when i was using in in the 70's. I was hoping to get the same fragrance with both the green and the yellow.Jade East was my favorite cologne and after shave and I was hoping I finally found it again. Would I purchase this again yes. but i do miss the original one.
1,ripoff,"way overpriced, come on really priced so high probably a 10K markup from the child laborers who produced this POC in some third world country."
4,The 1st appearance of L&H together,"The Lucky Dog is really a Stan Laurel film. Ollie was just a supporting character in the film. But it is believed that this isthe first time they were together in the same film.It`s not a great comedy, but there are plenty of laughs in it. And well worth seeing just to contrast how much Stan and Ollieevolved their characters between 1919 and the late 1920s."
2,These deteriorate quickly.,"I am giving these 2 stars because 1) they were great when new and [...]After 3 weeks on the car, they are streaking with what started as hairline streaks that are getting worse.(My car is a 208 Mazda 3 with 21"" and 18"" blades)I would not buy these again. [...]. To start deteriorating after a few weeks of winter rain is nuts. I am hoping I can get through the rest of the winter rain without buying another set of blades, but that may be tough here in Portland where I've still got 4-5 months of rain left.Do not buy these. They seem like a good design and work awesome when brand new, but then they go to crap.Bosch, please fix your quality."
3,Not that impressed,"I purchased 2 sets of these Bosch wipers for my car and my wifes van.First off both sets are squeaking already (less than 1 month old).The other issue is that they leave little lines across the entire windshield where they don't make complete contact,very annoying.I believe in Boschs' products but these wipers have not lived up to there name sake.Winter is coming and that will be the true test for these.We will see!Or maybe not!"
4,Happy with the ICONs.,"I bought these for my car back in November, and so far, so good. Installation was easy. Believe me. If I can do it, you can too! I have previously purchased the Rain-X Latitudes for my other car the previous month, and I prefer these over the Rain-X blades."
5,Bosch is the best - super easy install - good looks and performance,"What can I say? New wiper blades are great. It's NEXT winter that will tell me how well they've held up. I can say that these are the easiest wipers I've ever installed. They look really good with their clean, uncluttered style. They hold against the windshield well at highway speeds. No complaints. I try to get as many miles out of a pair of wipers as possible, and I've found you get what you pay for. I've never had a complaint about Bosch wipers, and this is their newest ""best"" so I'm expecting another Bosch success."
5,Survived Florida Heat and Sunshine for 13 months,I bought 2 of these for my Toyota Matrix in Aug 2008 which is about 13 months ago. I LOVED LOVED LOVED these when I got them! They were quiet and worked better then any blade I've used. I drive a lot and go nuts when I get streaks or if the blades squeak. About a month ago I started noticing spots right in front of my eyes and figured I need a new pair. I think that a year for blades in Florida's heat is pretty good and you can make up your own mind. I'm ordering another pair tonight because there is also a rebate [..]. That makes these almost 1/2 price.
1,Junk,"I like and use Bosch wiper blades, but these pieces of JUNK are a JOKE. They DO NOT deal with winter snow and slush and sleet well.Bosch is pretending that eliminating the open girder (spring frame) work of traditional wiper blades will suddenly yield value by sparing us from having blade ice up, but these blades still accumulate and carry ice crusts and, WORST OF ALL, cease to apply proper uniform pressure to wipe the windscreen!I'm going back to traditional blades."
1,This product does not last!,"After reading all the reviews and from Bosch's website, I thought I was buying a product that was top of the line and I was very wrong. I have only had this product installed on my Jeep Grand Cherokee for about 3 months now and they are already done with and need to be replaced. Both blades streak and do not clean the windshield completly at all. I would not recommend wasting your money on this product. I am switching back to Rain-X blades. Good luck if you do buy them!"
2,Does not last!,"I had the cheaper bosch wipers from walmart that didn't look too good on my 01 Passat but they worked well for 6 months. Of course up here in the Pacific Northwest I need to replace wipers every season. These wipers look good. However, performance is another issue. In only 2 weeks of moderate use they've started to leave lots of streaks even after cleaning the blade. Water is left behind and it chatters against the glass badly. I can't recommend anybody to buy these wipers."
5,Kaitlin's review on the case of the jingle bell jinx,"Another great Mary-Kate & Ashley book. In the beinning it is dull, but in the middle it get good. I hope you injoy this book."
4,The case of the jinglebell jinx Adventures :Marykate+Ashley,"it was a very good book.its about when marykate + ashley solved a case about their fave skaters.I got it for my birthday on dec.21,2001.If you liked their other books,you'll like this book."
3,Turn back the clock machine,There are a few timeless gems on this CD. Some tracks are just annoying 90's pop though.
4,"""CELINE'S STUNNING PERFORMANCES""","I think this album of hers is fantastic. She is comfortable singing dance songs as well as ballads. This is the reason that Unison is my favorite Celine Dion album. Her voice is in fine form. She definitely is one of the premiere singers of all time.Her album was released in September of 1990 and the album did go double platinum, but unfortunately for her Mariah Carey was getting more media attention and attention from Sony than Celine was getting. I think Celine's English debut can go toe to toe with Mariah's debut.If you are just now starting to become a Celine Dion fan I think this album is a great start."
4,... ...,"GREAT SERVICE: FAST, GOOD DISCS,GOOD PRICE! !I AM BUYING FOR MYSELF AND MY AND SIX GRANDCHILDREN."
3,"Not Very Original, But Good Dance Pop","This isn't a bad album. It's not very original, but for what it is it's okay. This is the only album I've heard from Celine Dion. I'm not a fan, but I decided to give it a listen anyway. If you like dance pop, then this is pretty good--but that's all it really is. The production and songwriting is good enough. She has a pretty good voice, but it sounds forced here and there though; the backing vocals sound good for the most part. The songs that stood out were ""The Last to Know"" and ""Loving Every Moment with You."" It's interesting that Aldo Nova helped out with the last song on this album--I've always liked most of the stuff he's done on his own. This album isn't very original, but it's good for what it is, dance pop."
2,A Not-So-Good Album,"I think this album was actually a waste of money. I only liked one song on this CD (which was ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now""). The rest were not any good. This is not one of Celine Dion's best albums."
3,Okay,I think some songs are better than others-the first 2 songs are not so good but the third one is good
1,Sad Beginning In America,"This album is an atrocity. Only one song, ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"", has life and feeling to it. I would not recommend this album."
4,A GREAT START...,"NOT CELINE'S BEST WORK, BUT AN EXCELLENT START. I STILL ENJOY LISTENING TO 'WHERE DOES MY HEART BEAT NOW?' SHE HAS JUST GOTTEN BETTER AND BETTER. NO TELLING WHERE THIS SUPER-TALENT WILL GO. FOR SOMEONE JUST BEGINNING TO LEARN ENGLISH AT THIS POINT, IT REALLY IS PHENOMENAL."
5,Great Unison cassette,"Unison is forty-three minutes and two seconds long and was released on September 11, 1990. Unison reached #74 on the US Billboard Album 200 charts and went Platinum. Of the five single released, only three of them charted. Unison is great to listen to and marks Celine first English song album. Celine Dion does not try to upstage herself nor is her ego in any of these songs. Though it does not want me make the jump to become a full fledge Celine Dion fan, it does make want to rent some of her other music. She gets an A+ on her first try.Side 1(If There Was) Any Other Way#35 U.S. Billboard Hot 100#8 U.S. Billboard Adult ContemporaryIf Love Is Out the QuestionWhere Does My Heart Beat Now#4 U.S. Billboard Hot 100#2 U.S. Billboard Adult ContemporaryThe Last To Know#22 U.S. Billboard Adult ContemporaryI'm Loving Every Moment With YouSide 2Love By Another NameUnisonDid not chartI Feel Too MuchIf We Could Start OverHave A HeartDid not chart"
4,Love it!,"This CD was Celine Dion's first English language album, recorded before she herself even spoke English. She recorded these songs not knowing what they even meant and they skyrocketed her to stardom.I love this song for its even mix of powerballads and upbeat songs. The title track, ""Unison"" is a great early 90s dance track. The rare 12"" Mix of this song is amazing though hard to come by.This CD also contains her first English language hit, ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"".My favorites on this album:(If There Was) Any Other WayIf Love Is Out The QuestionWhere Does My Heart Beat NowUnisonI Feel Too Much"
3,A melodic collection of songs,"Unison, Celine Dion's debut American English language album, was released in 1990. There are ten tracks. The songwriting is good, the musicianship is tight, and the sound quality is polished. The material is in a pop musical direction. Dion does a solid job with the vocals--they're smooth and attractive. There's more keyboard than guitar work throughout. Examples of songs that I enjoy are ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now,"" ""The Last to Know,"" ""I Feel Too Much,"" and ""If We Could Start Over."" The pretty ballad ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"" supplies industrious, soaring singing from Dion. The nicely tailored, charming ballad ""The Last to Know"" furnishes ethereal keyboard playing. ""I Feel Too Much"" is engaging and lively, while the well-crafted, tuneful ballad ""If We Could Start Over"" provides diligent vocals from Dion. The CD booklet contains the lyrics, and the back of the CD jewel case displays a color photo of Dion. The CD is just over 43 minutes. Unison is a catchy disc."
5,Not a fan of her recent work? Try this!,"Imagine this; at the time this album came out I was living in The Netherlands and Dion was little or not known yet, so it was in a CD shop catering mostly to alternative music (!) where I discovered this album. All you really need to know is that I do not listen to or buy much of her recent work, but this one is still in my CD player regularly! Try it, you will probably not be disappointed!"
2,Two stars is good. Really. Did anyone notice...,"That Laura Branigan's TOUCH (1987) and LAURA BRANIGAN (1990) seem to be the stylistic template for this album? ""Unison"" is on the latter album, and Celine's done ""The Power of Love"" on her hits comp. The interesting thing about this album is that it seems to be a false-start pop artist launch, in the sense the the sound of it, the synth-pop backing, doesn't seem to have carried off in her later english language recordings. ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"" seems to be kept off most of her hits comp albums, though it was getting extensive mall overhead play at one of my former jobs. Well, played often enough again and again and again... to be something like a jackhammer A/C song on the overhead muzak. Odd.Another artist having a one-off pop style change this reminds me most of is a period album by Sissel, with a load of Neil Sedaka easy pop material, which is nowhere near as good as her later stuff--ALL GOOD THINGS being the best starting place for Sissel."
4,AMAZING BEGINNING,"This 1990 album put Celine on the charts...great sounds and range. I believe she is much more polished and experienced now, but the early songs were just marvelous, ""Have a Heart,"" ""Unison,"" and ""The Last to Know."" I like the innocent, beautiful woman on the album cover, much more than the professional gal in Las Vegas - but all good. I like this one - her early days."
4,Good Value,The kids proudly display this on the wall. It was hard to find a flag locally which displayed our heritiage. Nice complement to our collection
4,Good Snake for drums/percs,"Have this snake in my home studio for a drum set, it helps too keep wires not as messy...fits perfect in the drum room"
2,Disappointing,"LOTS of quotations but the essays don't really become either practical or theoretical, walking a vague line between. I didn't find much very useful here, except for the excellent bibliography in the back."
5,My Favorite,"I own 4 Movado watches and this watch is by far my favorite. It is not the typical Movado style watch, it has a totally unique look it. Unlike most Movado's I feel this watch can be worn in a more casual setting as it has more of a youthful look to it, not commanding formal attire. The watch has the perfect weight and feels great as well as looks great. Out of my collection this is definitely my favorite."
2,Poor sound quality mars what could've been a great live album,"I can never get enough Orbital. The guys are brilliant.That said, when I listen to my music collection on shuffle and a track off this album happens to come up, I find myself clicking the ""Next"" button on the player.This album sounds like it was made by some guy who stood with a tape recorder in the parking lot outside the show.The live versions of the tracks are not different enough from the album versions to justify having to put up with the crowd noise and the hollow echo that resulted from their obviously haphazard recording technique.Unless you're a rabid completist--and I sympathize, if you are--give this album a pass."
5,chillin,"great funky cd. the guy at a&b suggested it when he saw the pile of cd's i was buying.from french electronic, disco to deep south blues this group knows how to kick back... and groove. if you like cafe del mar stuff or zero 7 id pick this one up too.enjoy"
5,The best gift ever,"""Opulent Restraint"" is THE book that you want to buy for all your friends or for anyone who truly loves and appreciates interior design. Arthur Dunnan is a true master! Additional information on Jed's/Arthur's unique style may be seen in ""Designers on Designers."""
2,"Great band, lousy mix","The low energy on this CD is compounded by a mix far too heavy with reverb. What was the engineer thinking? The original AWB hits worked so well partly because of the feeling of immediacy; the sound was _right there._ This CD sounds as if the singers are at the other end of a tunnel, and to make things worse, the tempo is sluggish and the performances sound tired.The frustrating part is that there's some good material here. Fortunately it's available in live versions that are infinitely better than this doomed studio effort, which sounds as if it was intended for listeners slow-dancing while stoned.Look for the AWB live albums."
1,Review,"Unfortunately, I had to return the toy because it wasn't right for my 6-year-old autistic son. It couldn't be used without the book."
5,Contents,"Lace and Lacey Weavesa compilation of 86 lace & lacey weave projects with complete worksheetsby Mary E. Snyderrevised edition ~ 1986""The author originally designed this book as a workshop textbook for her students. The book covers Lace weaves such as Bronson Lace, Swedish Lace, Huck, Spot Bronson and then shows you how to adapt them into your lacey weave project.The material that is contained in this book is a great basis for weavers of all levels to use in recognizing and comparing different lace structures. Each type of lace is given its own chapter that covers the threading system and offers treadling suggestions. This revised edition contains 86 projects with complete worksheets for all including both four and multiple harness projects. Clear photos of woven samples make it easy to follow."""
3,purchase price too high,"While there is some valuable information in this slim book, for a few dollars more, one can purchase Larry Fine's The Piano Book, which has far more detailed in information."
4,Danielle Harris...,"I must admit, the only reason I decided to watch this movie was due to the beautiful and talented Danielle Harris. The movie itself is the ""switch"" type film, sisted changes body with other sisted etc. Decent movie. It gets 4 stars for Danielle Harris!"
5,Katherine Heigl's Greatest Film!!,"Few films have touched my life as much as this. Here we have a powerful saga about Katherine Heigl being 18.Truly her outfits in this show off more of her body than in any other film.Oh and there is a plot. (like it matters) Here Heigl and her younger sister (played by an older Daneil Harris) switch bodies, wreching havok on their social lives.Face it, this movie could be about Heigl watching grassy grow. She's so beautiful and in almost every scene you can't help but love it. The opening scene of her getting dressed has brought men out of comas."
3,Lisa Jankovic,A cute little movie that is worth a look.Its just a fun and enjoyable movie that is great in anyones DVD collection.
4,Cute movie,"OK, so like almost everyone else here, I caught this movie on Disney one afternoon while channel surfing. It was actually pretty good--not the usual cornball stuff from Disney. A few adult topics are actually discussed, and the girls have truely distinct personalities."
1,great movie for disney,this is a great movie for disney but why do you charge alot for this item??...no good not alot of people are going to buy this movie if its that much to get it.
1,predictable; formula driven been done too many times,"one of the movies that are predictable from the get go. a formula driven venyure so not an iota of creativity.from the 'oh look at me, i am so cute...pose, turn...pose...to the ugly ducking turned swan; swan turned ugle duckling..a pure teenage movie...but i would not be happy if my kids liked it, i would inject them with brain stimulus to correct their apparent idiot-like shhep-following lack of selectivity as to what is worthy in life.i would think that any actor in reflecting on this movie would want to bury it, adobe out their features and replace it with somepne elses picture that they despise and want to get even with.is there enough money in the world for an actor to be in the slightest, be proud of their involvement...oh well, it must have made money for someone, why else would anyone want to be associated with it?disney, creativity, hmmm doesn't go together it seems anymore..."
2,Wish Upon a Star,"It took a long time to receive this item and I was concerned that it wasn't coming. Although I was happy with the product, I was surprised by its untimely arrival."
3,Wish Upon A Star- Good?,I have to admit that this wasnt a half bad movie. It would rank for ages 9-13 probably. I think the story was pretty good. Sort of like a Freaky Friday except this time sisters are trading roles. It had a very talented actress in the film Kathreine Heigl. So I recomend you see the film yourself to make your own opinion.
5,unhappy,"I'm really disappointed due to the fact that I can't find this movie to purchase. You would think a movie that gets rave reviews, you'd be able to find."
5,I Loved It!,I loved this movie so much! I saw it on the Disney Channel and thought it was awesome! I just wish I could find somewhere to buy it! This movie was great!
5,"I Wish I May,I Wish I Might,Become My Sister For A Night","I used to watch this film on The Disney Channel all the time!I always loved it but Disney didn't actually show you the whole movie!They edited more details out of the film which was very stupid.When I bought the video I noticed a few extra things and that's why you should buy it cause The Disney Channel didn't give us everything.I love this movie!It's about Alexia and Haley Wheaton.Alexia is pretty,popular,& is dating one of the most popular guys in school.Haley has good grades & a nice personality so one night they wish to be each other expecting nothing but the next morning they get it!Now buy it & you'll know what happens!"
5,Still like it,"Hadnt seen this in so long. I always enjoy going back to the 90s to watch ish I havent seen in 10+ yrs. Brings back memories. Im 22 male, i just up & came up with the idea after watching meangirls which you can tell it got a lot of ideas from this film esp with all the ""girl"" rules & the ""King & queening"" at the end. Plus I always thought the popular girl was so hot back then. I also saw another classic disney movie ""susie que"" & ""17 again"" recently. Disney was so good in the 90s compared to now I cant even watch since its no longer adult friendly like b4.IDK why a movie so old would be so expensive though, $50? Just watched it online for free... :/"
5,Great movie for teenage sisters!,"I've seen this movie several times on the Disney channel, and it is one of my favorites. It is similar to Freaky Friday in plot and theme, in that two sisters wish they could switch places, assuming the other has an easier and more fun life. This movie highlights the challenges of having a sister who is different from you, but also shows that the differences are what keeps the relationship b/w sisters so unique.I'm a freshmen in college with a sister who is a sophomore in high school, so it was definately a movie easy to relate to. This is a funny movie with a good message; it's definately a movie the whole family can appreciate, especially if there are teenage sisters involved. I hope it comes out on video soon!"
3,This movie is OK,"This movie is not the worst, not the best. Umm... I guess that's all I can say. Also, I think that some kids (7 yrs. and younger) probably shouldn't be allowed to see this movie because there is alot of kissing, talk about sexual references, and one part in the movie where Alexa (as Haley) wears a revealing outfit, and dances to a song on the cafeteria table. But all in all, it's a cute movie for young kids."
2,No characters,"I had high expectations for this book considering the positive reviews it received on Amazon. Unfortunately, the book was very disappointing. It is written like a very, VERY, VERY, long newspaper reports, stretching hundreds of pages, about the events surrounding the plague in London. There are no characters to speak of, other than the narrator, about whom we know very little and care even less. The rest is simply an endless list of dates, houses, sick people, etc."
3,odd,What an odd book. The forward is a scathing commentary about Defoe's ineptitude as a writer. I did not expect that. So far the content is interesting by certainly not riveting.
5,Work great,"I'm using this cable to connect my Integra pre-pro to a rack of Carvin amps powering my home theater, and it works very well.In regards to the complaint that the wires are too thin, that doesn't really matter for carrying a line-level signal. Don't blame the cable because you got careless while moving equipment around and damaged it."
3,The Return,"I was really enjoying the book as it started out. I enjoyed the story behind the baby's life. But later I lost interest. I didn't like the way Preacher and his wife were portrayed, or the old woman's confession. I felt it could've been written better. It lacked something but I'm not a writer so I can't really pinpoint what it lacked. I didn't see a point in the pack rat or the snake, or of the man who suddenly appeared and shot Catherine. All the ""coincidental"" curses seemed sorta far fetched that they would happen all at the same time. I knew from the start who the ""hunter"" was so I don't know why the author made such a secret of who he was. Where it talks about the footprint, the author didn't eleaborate on it and the sheriff didn't pursue it at all. It served no purpose to the story. The book did have a good beginning and good ending. The middle just needed ""something"". I have enjoyed a few of her other books much better written under the name of Sharon Sala."
5,The Return,I so loved this book! I come from a small gossipy town so I could really relate to how things such as this can affect people and hurt them. My daughter read this book right after me and said now any book she picks up isn't as good. I can't wait to read another by this author!
2,Correction,"In my review of yesterday I made a mistake that I wish to correct at this time. I still stand by my general comments concerning the lack of proper research. However, in fairness to the author,I wish to make one correction: the aggravating errors were not about a snake; but there were several mistakes concerning the flora and fauna found in Kentucky. I also think Ms McCall needs to learn alot more about the behavior of hunting dogs and mountain people. I apologize for my error; at the time I had just read 2 books set in Kentucky, both of which had glaring errors about the area and I had them mixed up as to which error went with which book. I guess this is what happens when you write something when you are upset about stereotypes and other misconceptions about the place you love."
5,The Return By Dinah McCall,I think the RETURN is an excellent book and Dinah Should wright a sequal to the RETURN because i would like to know where Catherin and Luke live and if Catherine gets a job. i would also like to know what happens to lovie. i would recommend anyone who likes a good romance book to read the RETURN.
2,Research needed on this one,"I usually enjoy Mc Call's books very much. As a resident of Kentucky (the book's setting) I was turned off in the first few pages by two very obvious errors concerning one snake. Authors who make money off our book purchases owe it to their readers to do research on the setting;historical period;etc to avoid this type of mistake. It's just part of the writer's job. Despite public opinion, not all romance readers are uneducated and/or stupid. If the genre wishes to be taken seriously, writers must do the proper research and/or editors need to be better informed. From now on I'm afraid that I will always wonder if Ms. McCall's other books are as inaccurate as this one was."
3,Mike Hammer VS. Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer: Song Bird,"Apparently this DVD is the same as Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer: Song Bird (1984). This is one of the later episodes (minus Pat Chambers and plus Nick.) I prefer the earlier episodes, but they seem to be as yet unavailable on DVD."
5,"Simply, the best book written on knife sharpening.","If you have a hard time sharpening your knife to a razor edge like I did, then this book will teach you. It goes against some things you've been told, but don't worry. John Juranitch knows the edge like nobody else. Get this book."
3,Not so Sharp,"I was overall disappointed in the 'procedural' simplicfication. The book is full of angles and different edges but I ONLY wanted to know how to sharpen my kitchen knives, not a campsite axe and so I should've researched this better before buying. There are different methods minimully explored. This book has not helped me sharpen my carving knives."
5,Five Star Read,What an informative book. The photos are a little old (circa 1975) but that doesn't effect the content of the book. The history they teach in the field of sharpening is thoughtful and fascinating. The studies they have conducted in their research have been extensive and the results at times have surprised even the writers. I had no idea that the common man could get such a sharp edge on his knifes.After reading just 30 pages I felt compelled to find their website and place an order for a very nice honing set. The package included a copy of the book which I obviously did not need. I asked them to substitute the book for a copy of the video they sell. They granted my request with no qualms.I am obliged to them for the knowledge they have shared and I am sure I will do business with them in the future. I wish I could afford to purchase the honing set I bought for myself as gifts for loved ones.FIVE stars without a doubt.
5,EASY EDGE GUIDE,I spent 15 years playing with wood and trying to make knives. Great hobby but short something. Always sharp but not razor sharp. This book showed me how to get the edge I wanted. Now when I sharpen a knife for someone I give them a bandaid when I give the knife back. I SWEAR.
4,The Razor Edge Book of Sharpening,Very nice and useful book. A little bit of theory and detailed sections for each tool. I'll recommend it.
4,The Razor Edge Book of Sharpening,Very helpful book on the art of knife and tool sharpening. I have never had knives as sharp as they are now. I would highly recommend this book.
2,The Razor Eage of Sharpening by John JUranitch,"Not a very modern book about 16 years out of date now.is major book about one person's sharpening system and yet it does have a lot of infromation on how to sharpen knives and such.which is a lot more that almost all the other books sold out there.If you get ripped on other books on ""how to sharpen"" and want something else get this oneToma the Old One of ""SHARP NOW! company"
3,"Helpful, but not the solution.","This book taught the principles of sharpening very well, but it did lack detailed instruction to acctualy sharpen a knife without any previous experience. The instruction half only tells you to apply what you have learned in the first half of the book and is mostly a repitition of the first 40 pages of the book. I also purchased the razor edge guide and descovered it isnt as simple or as precise as it is described."
5,Perfect for the beginner and expert alike!,"I learned how to sharpen knives from my father and he his father, this book covers what your father never knew. After practicing on old knives for a month or two I was sharpening like an expert. People are amazed at how sharp I can make an edge, it's a thrill to watch a persons eyes pop out of their head when, in a very short period of time, you have taken their dull, bent and rusted knife edge sharpened it to a glistening working tool and are using it to shave your beard! I've had friends drop off buckets of knives they thought they'd never use again. This is THE BOOK, the bible of tool sharpening. It's simple and easy to understand. If there is someone who would like to give this book to me as a gift, I won't turn it down. My local library is getting tired of me checking out the same book over and over again!"
4,Less is more.,"For those inspired by the Razor Edge Systems catalogue: don't expect a single word about hollow grind straight razors in this book because you won't find it; in general, the care for this type of grind could have been treated in more detail.So far the missing star. But it offers simple and no-nonsense techniques to sharpen axes, knives, arrowheads, chisels or chainsaws yourself. It will keep both dummies and experts from bringing their tools to the local store for sharpening."
3,Terrible picture quality. Violent Professionals deserves a remastered version.,"Poor Picture quality gets 1 1/2 stars ~ Overall run time 191 mins ~ Keepcase ~ Comes with an Alpha video dvd booklet insertDeadly Drifter ~ 1 1/2 stars ~ Run time 91 minsViolent Professionals ~ 5 stars ~ Run time 100 mins Great movie, poor picture, a hideous green horizontal line on the right side of the screen early on (fades after a minute or so) makes it clear that this film needs remastering badly. I know there is a rather expensive dvd version of this available same listed run time, same widescreen, (yes this is a widescreen version here the ratio is 1:88/1 or close to it.) Same picture I assume, the only difference is that it is alone with a cool looking artwork cover.Overall: 3 stars worth buying for Violent Professionals poor picture et all"
2,An item to avoid,"This DVD is captured in the late 80's, and features an Eric Burdon Band including Jamie Moses on guitar. The performance is excelent, but there are several reasons to AVOID this DVD:1. It's a bootleg, and you will cause Eric econimical harm by buying it.2. The sound is AWFUL! You can't hear Erics singing, and when you can't do that, you miss the whole point of the gig.3. It's very short! Only a 3/4 hour or so.Hopefully, this will talk you out of buying it :-)And if you want a really good concert DVD with Eric, buy the Live at The Coach House DVD!"
1,WHY ???????????????????????,WHY WOULD ANY ARTIST KNOWINGLY ALLOW A DVD OF THIS POOR QUALITY TO BE SOLD. THIS IS NOT EVEN A GOOD CAMCORDER QUALITY DVD.I DON'T THINK ERIC WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS DVD.IT'S NOT EVEN A VERY GOOD BOOTLEG....AND THE 5 STAR REVIEW WAS FOR THE OTHER ERIC AT THE COACH HOUSE DVD. THATS THE ONE TO BUY....
1,Eric's microphone was unplugged,"We all have heard of the so called ""unplugged"" performances from Clapton to Rod Stewart, but nobody warned me about this DVD. It should have been titled ""Eric Burdon Unplugged"". His mike is either unplugged or more likely, a software glich occurred in the audio. I called 800-356-0944 ext. 146 to complain but the group that released this dvd was unaware of the problem. If you have the same problem, call this number and they may have an explanation. The dvd continues to be for sale at major retailers."
2,"Not what I expected, However .....","The quality on this dvd is poor all the way around,BUT, it is right up Eric's alley. He performs well and he is a die hard old tradition fan. He would rather here his music in mono than stereo because he likes the purity of the traditional blues. You can't hate him for that. I, for one, am real happy with it!!"
3,Trial and Error,The third Ex Machina graphic novel unfortunately trots out the tired old story of an imposter of the Great Machine running around New York. Fortunately that isn't all this volume has. The story of Mitchell serving Jury Duty is an excellent plot that helps make up for some of the obviousness of the imposter story.The volume also includes a two part story where we meet Mitchell's mother and learn about the death of his father which sheds some new light on the background of our protagonist. Not the best of this series by a long shot but still worth reading.
3,Not bad.,"Brian K. Vaughan, Ex Machina: Fact v. Fiction (Wildstorm, 2006)Mitchell Hundred keeps trying to run New York City his way, and people keep wanting him to stop. As usual, there's a mini-mystery running through the volume (and, as usual, it's the weakest part of the book); it's predictable, and you can ignore it, but the rest of the book is just as interesting as the series has been so far. Vaughan continues to impress me with his ability to take the much-overdone ""post-9/11"" genre and make something worthwhile of it. ***"
5,The story continues!,"Having read the first two stories, this book continues the excellent story about a mayor of New York who is a super hero. I would recommend starting at the beginning as this is not the starting off point.The story arc continues devling into the struggles of a man who has powers and yet is in charge of the biggest city in the US. The dilemas he goes through show his humanity and make it a fun ride."
2,What Happened?,"Without question, I would have given the first two Ex Machina books 5 stars each -- they were phenomenal. So it was with no trepidation that I quickly consumed this 3rd book. But what a travesty!One reviewer below dismissively says something to the effect of, ""The story doesn't compare to the previous two..."" but then goes on to give the darn thing 4 stars! The story doesn't BEGIN to approach the creativity of the previous two. I was shocked by how simple, abrupt, and two-dimensional the plot was. The art was fine, but fundamentally I'm reading for the story and it was bordering on insipid in this 3rd book. Let's hope they have their act together for the next one."
1,fact:,vaughan is the world's biggest poseur and the worst writer in the history of the english language
4,Historical Film,"This release gives us a film, not just with America's Sweetheart, but written and DIRECTED by Frances Marion who wrote more screenplays than any other woman in screen history. It's a wonderful love story about a woman who falls in love with a stray (AWOL) soldier who she thinks is American. But he turns out to be German. Not a comedy. Nice print, nicely restored. The musical accompaniment starts out quite nice and eventually nearly drove me crazy. But you can always turn it off. The film is worth it....."
3,The Love light,"Another Mary Pickford film...how can you dislike anything she is in? But this one is only fair. The plot is superb (They should remake this today) but the video is kind of poor quality...a lot of dark scenes where it is hard to see what is going on. In some cases, it gets confusing who is who. Worth watching if you are in to silent films, but if this is your firsat venture into the silents, I would recommend The General, or if you want to see Mary Pickford, then perhaps My Best Girl."
5,Like this very much,I used to have this but it got lost so I decided to buy another one. It comes in handy.
1,Needs to be fixed,"I also bought this Roberts 30002 vinyl tile cutter at my local Home Depot. If fact, I also found a problem with the bearing on the cutter arm. I took the first one back because his bearing broke. I brought the new one home and, low and behold, this bearing also broke. I am going to return this and look for a better product. This product should be taken off the shelves at all Home Depot stores until the problem with this bearing is corrected."
1,Does not work!,"I bought one of these cutters and once I got it it seemed to be sturdy and well put together, problem is it would not cut VCT at all."
4,Vynl Tile Cutter,"Just finished 350 square feet of 12 "" vynl tiling. This product worked very wellfor cutting and trimming. Remember to keep your work surface clean, keep the blade clean, and push the handle down slowly. This will ensure a perfectly straight cut."
3,Really Cheesy,"The title does not lie - this is a cheesy book. Interesting but the facts are a little too lengthy for what I was looking for, which was more the ""bathroom reader"" type. Good book but not for me."
5,Yummy Gwen Stefani Fashion Doll,"Totally adorable! My daughter is a Gwen/No Doubt collector, and this is a great addition to her collection. This merchant did a great job!"
4,"It's the s**t yo, holla if ya hear me",This is one of the greatest accounts of 2Pac's life out on the market today. It's got tha bomb interviews
1,This DVD [is Bad],"This DVD [is bad]. A lot of talk very little action and even less music. All it is is a couple of guys who no ever heard about, talking about 2Pac. If you're a 2Pac fan you'll be disappointed"
1,what the ...,"what the hell was that! I am so glad that ""Before I Wake"" came out because that impression that was left on my brain from ""Thug Immortal"" makes me wanna earl beef chow mein. whoever got these guys their distribution deal needs to be applauded because they are truly the slickest characters this side of grease. Go ahead and pick up ""Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake"" if you wanna feel 2Pac & not just have something tied into his name."
1,Persionally I think the video stunk!,"Persionaly I think the video stunk! I mean not to dis my brotha pac, but there was no pac in it. Do you think I care about a bunch of fakes, that pac left becasue they were phonies. Im sorry but those people in the movie were as fake as they come man. Get rid of them and show me 2PAC! I love ya man R.I.P. Tupac Amur Shakur 1971-1996"
3,was good for what it was,wasnt all that great.the only cool thing about itwas how it gaveinterviews of various people that interacted withTupac throughout the end of his life--i was looking for something a little morecomprehensive (something about his whole life)so i was disappointed.
3,Ameer thinks it was a solid effort on a limited budget,This video dealt mainly with Tupac life when he first got to Marin City California (Near Oakland). The documentary was both entertaining and enlightening. The production quality was subpar and some of the people interviewed seem to be unnecessary. Overall for the Tupac fan this is a must have. The footage of tupac on camcorder alone is worth the price of the DVD. If the quality and production had been better I probably would have given it a 4 and half.
3,tHUG IMMORTAL,IT WAS AN OK VIDEO I LOVE PAC BUT I WAS DISSAPOINTED IN IT I THINK THAT IT WAS ALRIGHT WHEN THEY TALKED TO HIS OLD FRINEDS THEY TALKED TO SUGE ALSO BUT IT WAS KINDA BORIN AT SOME PARTS CUZ THEY TALKED TO THESE LOSERS U NEVA HEARD BOUT THEY WERE REPORTERS OR SOMETHIN I WOULDNT SAY U NEED TO GET IT BUT IT GIVES U A VERY DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE NIGHT THE BEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME GOT SHOT THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 3 STARS IZ CUZ ITS 2PAC AND THE PART WHERE THEY GIVE U DETAILS BOUT HIS DEATH AND WHEN THEY TALKED TO SUGE WAS COOL THEY ALSO HAD COOL HOME VIDEO R.I.P 2PAC 1 LUV TO THE KING OF THUGZ
2,disapointed,"I think this dvd was so cheap to produce, you go around with a camcorder and interview guys who crossed Tupac at one time or other!For [the money] it [isn't worth it], i was annoyed about the amount of screentime these nobodys had...i agree with the other review, the best part of this dvd is tupac fronting a street seller, with fake Tupac tapes... wow Tupac was angry!I wonder if he would of liked me? i dont care Tupac was an amazing actor, and who knows what he would of gone on to do?'life goes on' ok tupac i will have a 'Hennesy' on you plus Cato!!!"
1,Don't Get Mugged by Thug Life,"This video is a collection of interviews with minor characters in Tupac's life. Tupac never shows up in it! What they had to say about the performer could have been condensed into a 10 minute production--if that. Your money is much better spent buying the Tupac Resurrection video, which is really very good and actually has Tupac giving the interviews."
2,Shackleton - The Search for Good Video Documentation,"As one thirsty to find good video content on Shackleton's legendary expedition to Antartica, I am especially interested in Hurley's (Shackleton's photographer on his Endurance voyage) motion picture images, said to exist and to be used to document that trip. Unfortunately, this video has (little or) no footage of Hurley's moving pictures, but does contain the most famous still photos. Perhaps the weakest part of the video is the periodic dramatization, in a studio, of the life threatening circumstances. The snow and setting are obviously fake and don't convey the sense of suffering and harsh conditions under which the expedition labored. On the positive side, the video does a good overall bio on Shackleton, presenting him in a positive light, and showing something of the extraordinary nature of his character."
2,Ringo Lam's The Adventurers,"The Adventurers is a fairly average actioner from the once prolific Ringo Lam, more remembered for Andy Lau's then-record-breaking salary for a Hong Kong film (US$1.5m) than its qualities as a film. It has a couple of good moments, but its burdened by a ridiculous plot even by HK standards - after botching an assassination attempt on the uncle who killed his parents for the Khmer Rouge, fighter pilot Lau goes to America, joins the CIA, where they make him the head of the biggest triad in San Francisco so he can kidnap and marry said uncle's daughter to find out about arms shipments to Cambodia... as you do. It's not uncommon for HK films to make the plot up as they go along, but this one plays like they had a different writer for each reel, none of whom were told what the others were doing. An okay time-filler, but no more."
4,Wallander is a good mystery series,If there weren't so many 5 star mystery series available I would have given Wallander a 5. It is much different than the British mysteries but holds your interest. Really worth getting. Won't be wasting your money.
5,Excellent Production By Revered BBC,"Well developed storyline/plot and characters. There were a few moments when I felt actions could have been better understood and followed had there been more background provided. There is an atmosphere of depression throughout most of it, in keeping with the character of Wallander. I feel I am particular about movies and usually watch British productions. I find myself looking eagerly forward to future episodes, despite its few flaws."
2,These BBC versions of Wallander,"These BBC versions of Wallander lack the grit and everyday-Sweden feel of the Swedish TV series. Too much Branagh, not enough Sweden. Rather dark and hard for me to enjoy."
4,kenneth branagh a great actor,i love these british movies and wallander is another great one.if you enjoy detective movies this is one you will want to see.
1,"Really, really hated it!","After watching the first two seasons, I should have stopped there when I saw the direction in which the show was going. I actually turned off an episode partway through--the graphic violence was over the top and didn't need to be portrayed as such. It surprises me that Kenneth Branagh chooses to be a part of this. I thought he was better than that."
3,Too Many Cell Phone Interuptions,"Good stories, locations, and acting. It was all interupted by constant and very annoying cell phone rings of the main character's cell phone. There was also his continual whining and roller coaster emotional displays."
1,Love the show; hated this episode.,"What a letdown! After such an exciting adventure in Riga, we are left with this bummer. I'm offended as a Christian to be presumed the equivalent as the likes of the UFO-freaks (Heavens Gate) or any blaspheming cult. Its a shame, because Wallander's character could really use some good old fashioned Jesus religion to give him some faith to hold onto."
1,Blu Ray Doesn't Play,"The Blu Ray version of this work will not play in either of my blu-ray players. Two disks, neither of them play in either machine, though the machines seem to read the disks. Buyer beware."
5,whoa,Kenneth Branagh is a brillant actor. These mysteries are amazing. You never know who did it until the end. He is a true star
4,VOLVO: The Series,"It's sometimes unclear whether this series was inspired by product placement fees or appreciation of Henning Mankell's Wallander series, but it is handsome, Branagh is credible, and the generally free adaptations are not bad, as long as you're not too literal-minded. Those devoted to the novels will miss significant plot elements, dozens of staff meetings, an unkempt apartment, dirty laundry, and a depressive but somehow wonderful man who eats terrible food and drinks too much - all replaced by worshipful shots of Volvos. Possibly the best and longest car commercials ever made..."
5,Wallander,I loved it and wished there were more episodes. Very good mysteries. I like main characters who have flaws and Wallander has many
3,Pretty but light in color and weight,This item is very pretty and it is identical to the picture. However the color of the stone is very pale and the item itself is lightweight. Does not feel worth the cost of the item. But I do like the design and hope that it holds up well because it is very attractive.
5,AND I THOUGHT SEINLANGUAGE WAS FUNNY!,That doesnt even begin to compare to Chris Rock's book. I had noticed that Chris Rock became hella famous this year and I always thought of him as hailrious on the reruns of SNL on Comedy Central. My best friend was on the phone w/ me and she started reading me from the book and I will swear to God i almost peed my pants!I had never heard anything that funny! ANd that was just the phone sex part. So I read it and OHMYLORD! Get this book and a new pair of underwear cuz I can almost guarentee you'll wet yourself silly!
3,Funny,"I love to read good books and this one certainly fits my bookshelf. It is so funn, you will share is with everyoneYou connect with."
5,LOL,"Oh my God. I love this book. Chris Rock is funny in his own expletive way. However, he does have a way of making you think. You have to read it; it's HILARIOUS."
5,funny,"i love comedy. ive loved chris rock since snl and ive always thought he was hilarious. ive also loved comedy books. when i saw this book i jumped to buy it and as soon as i started reading i was hooked. this a collection of his standup work in book form, and its hilarious! i deals with [] things as race, sex, relationships, brocolli and cheese, and more. i love this its definately a must read and also buy comedy books by Dennis Miller, Drew Carey, and especcially George Carlin if you like this."
1,Neither funny nor enlightening,"I read the first 100 pages, and that was enough for me. The comments on racism could have been thought provoking, but seem to imply all Caucasians have to apologize for being ""white."" One chapter discusses how ""whites can't tell blacks apart,"" but Mr. Rock lumps all ""whites"" into one category, ignorant of the racism and persecution many ""whites"" have endured, and not all come from the same place and status. By the time he got to talking about doctors and how they shouldn't be paid, I was finished. I can hear racist rants anywhere; just because this is couched in the guise of comedy, it makes it no less of a prejudiced, racist view. Mr. Rock openly admits it is racist, but assumes people will find it amusing and enlightening. I found it to be neither. The sociology of race has been written about in more interesting, engrossing texts; I'll stick to those."
5,Craziest Comedian,"There is nothing to say about this book but that it makes you laugh at every joke that is printed inside this book on the pages. There is no doubt that this book will give you at least 10 laughs by the time the book is finished. If you missed all the other videos or performances of Chris Rock, well get ready to Rock This!"
2,Very Average,"Chris Rock is Talented but I Would Never Put Him In The Same Category as Eddie Murphy,Richard Pryor,Redd Foxx or Rudy Ray Moore.I Enjoy Certain things He Says but after a While it's The Same thing Over&Over AGain.he uses the same Routine&WHen You Have Heard it Once you have Heard it a Thousand times.A Good Talent but A Bit OVERRATED."
2,Keep your money.,"I really like Chris Rock as an actor and comedian, but I found the first half of this book really offensive. All about whites/blacks and lalalalala. Got on my nerves, I didn't even want to keep reading on. I don't think you need to put down another race page after page to get a laugh. It's just not funny after awhile. The rest of the book was somewhat funny, but nothing he hasn't said before."
1,"""Rock This"" is devoid of any humor.","I purchased ""Rock This"" because I think Chris Rock is a very funny stand-up comedian. Surprisingly, his book was not funny at all. I searched desperately for the humor, but could not find any. I found Rock This to be depressing, offensive, and degrading. I was considering purchasing Whoopie Goldberg's book, but after reading Rock This, I Think Not."
1,Was This Supposed to be Funny?,"Normally I don't review if I can't find something nice to say about a book, however, I'll make an exception in this case. The so-called humor in this book is racist and degrading to all people. Fortunately, someone lent me this book so I didn't spend money on it. I only made it to page 44 when I realized that negative black/white comparisons sprinkled with liberal doses of the n-word were as ""funny"" as this book was going to get. It's sad to see how some people can get rich validating negative stereotypes to the majority and passing it off for entertainment."
5,Really enjoyed it,"I finished reading this book in half a day. I really enjoyed it. Some reviewes say this book too offensive, as asian myself I couldn't really get their pictures sorry.. But I loved his insight about social problems and all kind of stuff. Good buy."
4,Better as an anal toy,"Though is is billed as a gspot toy, the 1 inch girth makes it rather ineffective for vaginal play. Does, however, work incredibly well as an anal toy- the tapered head makes insertion a breeze, the ridges make penetration to the desired depth easy and prevents it from slipping further in than comfort will allow, and the ridges hit the prostate (or gspot through the perineal wall) perfectly.As always, Tantus uses 100% medical grade silicone, so you can boil any toy after use to sterilize and it won't retain odors. Don't let the ridges intimidate you- this is actually the perfect size for someone new to anal play."
4,Like it but not enough texture...,"We have the Tantus Ease and got this one because it's a little longer and we need that. We love the Ease, but at 5 1/4"" long, it's about 1 to 1-1/2 inches too short. We were hopeful this longer one (6"") might be better. We like this one OK, but it's too smooth. The Ease has vein-like ridges and hit the right places. This one is so smoothly molded that I can't really feel the in/out very much. It's great if you like smooth, but I'd prefer a little more friction/stimulation."
2,ineffective,"It looks great on screen, but agreeing with the previous review, it is ineffective for vag play. Too thin and too flimsy. But, if you don't need as much girth, then this is the one for you!"
4,Desgarradora realidad,"Es un libro que describe con exactitud lo que ocurrio en la dictadura militar de Argentina en la decada del 70, todo esta relatado desde el punto de un subversivo, pero su relato es muy completo"
3,Ramble,"This book is very rambley- I had to read it for a class and all of my peers felt the same way. The argument could have been a lot more concise, too. I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again. I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again. There are much better books on the topic."
1,Poor quality cable,"This cable started having problems just after a couple of months of light use. The connection at the female end became loose and wouldn't hold a male cable firmly, causing audio to cut in and out. I'll never buy one of these again."
1,ext cord without QC,"I needed this ext so I could sit across the room and listen. This cable is the most poorly made cable I've ever purchased. The female end is to large, the male end from the headphones just falls out when plugged into it. I have to use scotch tape to hold them together. I have since purchased another cable that works fine. I would not recommend this cable to anyone, unless you really like scotch tape."
3,Excellent compass except for one glaring failing,"My title says most of it. The problem is that the indices or bearing marks on the compass are made in relation to the points of the compass. So you need to think ""37 degrees east of south"" or ""60 degrees west of north"".In _every_ professional (or good amateur) setting I know, bearings are given based on the 360 degree circle: ""Bear 118 degrees"" etc. The Navy, the National Forest Service, the USGS -- all do it this way.Why did the chumps at Silva do it the ""old fashioned way""? My guess is, if I check, I'll find that there is a _more expensive_ Silva compass that does it the better way."
5,most excellent seasoned salt,This is one of the finest seasoned salt blends I've ever enjoyed. This citrus one is most excellent for seafood. I think its great in moderation and I bet you will too on a striped bass filet or swordfish steak under the broiler. Pepper not included.
4,"Bad quality reprint, good quality content","I contemplated buying this book a few years ago when the original edition was still available, but put it off until earlier this year. The book is now available only as a reprint and the quality is nowhere near as good as the original. For a $185 book, I was somewhat disappointed. Still, at least the content hasn't changed.Topics in this book include cryptanalysis of substitution ciphers, polyalphabetic ciphers, playfair and rotor machines. It has a chapter on the design and analysis of the DES block cipher. The final part of the book concentrates on key management.The approach is mainly from a statistical angle, as opposed to combinatorics or number theory (which is more common in crypto textbooks). There is not a lot on public key crypto (or even modern cryptanalysis methods) in here, but it is a nice introduction to cryptology from a well-respected cryptographer."
3,"Cables work, not too great for xbox","I got this for my turtle beach headphones and was kind of disappointed because shipping was just as much as the product itself. I plugged these into my xbox controller and they don't stay in very well, little movement will dislodge them from the controller. This product however does not make any claim to fit well with xbox controllers"
2,Not what the description says,The description of this product is misleading. I was looking for 2.5mm to 2.5mm male to male. It turns out that this is a normal 3.5mm to 3.5mm male to male. To me Stereo MINI always has meant the 2.5mm. Don't order this if your looking for the mini 2.5 jacks. I returned mine.
3,Its ok for a back up,"Its cheap, quality ok but it will short out fast. Youre better off buying an new pair of turtle beaches."
4,Good product,"The product works good :) its not what I was looking for, but it's a great stereo cord I love it"
1,"Do not buy, low quality product","I had this for under a week before it internally shorted out and was useless. I bought it as a replacement talk cable to run from my gaming headset to my xbox controller and in failed in 4 days. The other thing i liked about it was that it was thicker, so i figured it would last a while, but I was wrong."
3,Heavy duty cord with a catch.,"The cord is very durable, but it slides out of my xbox 360 controller and adds a little distortion to chat levels. Works for the price, but if you have the extra cash go to the Turtle Beach site."
3,Works on X11's,The cord works on my x11's so this is a much better option than buying it from the turtle beach website.
2,not for xbox controller,reviews are misleading...not a 2.5mm for xbox controller...actually a 3.5mm...hate to waste the time returning it so i may keep it for my mp3 devices...my son is bummed
3,It's a 3.5mm Cable,"I was searching for a 2.5mm and this showed up in the amazon search; I foolishly bought it thinking it was a 2.5mm cable. It's a basic cable, I'm sure it works fine, but the mediocre review comes into play because of the lack of description."
3,Read discription carefully,"Read the description very carefully not the reveiws. It is a 3.5mm male to male adapter not a 2.5mm male to male adapter. The 2.5mm is the one that is used for the turtle beach headsets, so all these reviews about it working perfect and is better than the OEM is a lie. Works great for my phone though and I guess I'll use it while driving to bestbuy or RadioShack to get the 2.5mm male to 2.5mm male cable.Oh I gave it a 3 star because it wasn't a totallose and it was what it said it was."
1,get a different one,"I got this one and couldn't figure it out at all! The manual is not very helpful, I couldn't for the life of me understand how the heck you were supposed to get the music onto the player. I gave up, sent it back and got a Transcend which works like a dream and is E-Z to set up! If you do get this one, good luck getting it to work."
5,I Remember Missy!,"All the people in this book are real people! I went to school with Missy, Karen & Laura! I remember Missy well! She was a sweet, good natured, well liked, beautiful girl. Karen WAS manipulative, mean, nasty, vendictive, just like the book portrays her to be. Karen beat me up outside the school one day because I was talking to her boyfriend! Laura was a follower and Karen's puppet. This book told it like it happened....as I remembered it when it happened. Plain and simple! The writer conveyed it well."
3,Missy's Murder,"What difference does it make if the victim slept with every man she met? What does that mean, did she deserve to die? I really don't understand how people can think it, let alone write it. The story of Missy's murder is a sad one. A young girl is murdered by a girl she considered her friend. The killer then moves in with her poor family pretending to be a devoted friend when she was nothing then a jealous psycho. While ""Missy's Murder"" is not one of the best true crime books out there it is still an interesting story."
2,Interesting Story,"This was the first true crime book I ever read. I enjoyed it and was enthralled with it then (I was about 13).The story is an interesting one, and a definate page turner. If only some one else had wrote the book, and if it had not been so overdramatized, Missy's Murder would have recieved a lot more attention and stars. Missy sounds like an absolute angel, and Karen sounds like a complete monster. I tend to believe that even the worst monster shows some good before their monstrocity. In this book NOTHING was good or even slightly likable about Karen, The fat homely witch she was (Kingsbury's view). I don't think this book did the Avila family justice, and least of all any of the main characthers."
3,Jealousy caused this murder,"""Missy's Murder"" is a sad but true book about 2 teenagers who murdered a friend out of jealousy. I bought this book when it first came out and I didn't like it then - but over the years, I thought I might change my mind and would really like it. Well, I read it again for a second time and it was still just OK."
3,"A good quick read, but very little mystery as to Who done it","Written primarily from transcripts and interviews, the author, Karen Kingsbury, re-creates conversations and situations that have been told or are part of the court records. There is a simplicity to this tale of mis-guided revenge, and the author tries to keep some idenities under wraps, as to who did what to whom. But after awhile, it becomes apparent who was involved, and the characters are far from sympathetic creatures. The trial coverage is quick, and the prosecutor (like defense team and judge) are drawn like stick figures in a cardboard diorama. We don't get a glimpse inside their heads, only perceptions of dialogue that have been constructed by the author."
3,Missy wasn't the angel she was portrayed to be!!,"I am very disappointed every time I read this book (and I have read it many times,) because the author portrays Missy to be a sweet innocent angel which she definitely WAS NOT. I grew up with Missy and I knew Karen in school as well. I never met Laura, but the few times I saw her with Missy and Karen, she gave me the creeps. As for Missy, she was one of the meanest people I ever knew. She was the worst bully I ever encountered as a child and I never saw any other side to her. She was just as awful as the friends that killed her. It's too bad that the author didn't get the whole story but only interviewed people that loved Missy. There were a lot of people that couldn't stand her. Other than that, I would say that the book was very real and accurate, if not way too dramatic."
2,Sadly the tv movie was more thrilling,"and it was only loosely based on the book! If I had a choice between the cookie cutter book and the basic tv movie, I pick the movie. This book did little to promote humanity to any of its characters and its a shame b/c a true author could of really turned the story into something if taken the time. By the way, the movie is titled A Killer Among Friends, catch it on Lifetime tv, grab this book in the dollar bin of a supermarket!"
5,what size,"What size is this model???????????is it 1/24 or 1/72 you read about it,in one section it says it`s 1/24 and the main title it`s says it`s 1/72?????????"
2,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THEY DID send me a ""used"" model kit. NOthing fits well!!!!!!I don't have time to return this, otherwise I won't keep it.THe reason why I gave 2 stars is because of the delivery."
3,Average Bird,You must relize that when I give this model a rating of three stars it is average. I liked how durable it was compared to other models and how the actual molded parts were black to start with so you didn't have to paint a grey blackbird black. But other than that there really isn't much to brag about save its size so I gave it the average. Its what you should expect from a skill level 2.
1,Ewwww!,I love mango anything except for this. They have a really oily taste. Yuck. I was quite disappointed. I wish they came by the pack instead of a whole case so I wouldn't have wasted so much money trying them out.
1,Dreadful,"The first track is punctuated by annoying percussion noises that interrupt whatever the melody might be. If one were trying to get to sleep, this would be the anti-sleep track. Other tracks have very strange electronic tone shifts - akin to the sound made by a tape recorder if you manually stopped the reel. One of these tracks made me feel like I was going to throw up. The tracks that were not actually annoying were devoid of musicality and did not rise to even the level of mediocrity.Shame, because other disks in this series are quite pleasant."
2,Give a relative a job.,"This has to be nepotism in work because I have all of the albums and they all sound the same.....cheap and repetitive. Boring enough, though, to help you get to sleep at night (at least my dog thinks so)."
5,Works great,"Good little connector cable. Well constructed, durable, built to last. I would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes. Worth it."
5,Its fine,It's a cable.....It worked and there is no interference or crackle.Does what it should with no issues. I'm happy
1,blah,Ok so these Cables are good if your in a rush and have a gig and forgot some cables at home. however these things don't last at all. belive me when I say it does not pay to be cheep. If you go with something a bit more Pricey it will be worth it in the long hall.. expectly if you are gigging alot or on tour
3,Over all a good movie.,"I had seen the movie before I believe on some streaming service however I wasn't able to find it, and was in the mood for it. When I saw the price I was somewhat hesitant, however I decided to go for it. For the year it was made in, watching it again it was an obvious low budget film. They constantly have split screens with FDR, Churchill, and Stalin talking to each other as if they're in the same room with no obvious forms of communication and the room, and the split screen is even good it's a blurred line down the middle. Sometimes it won't even be a split screen it will be the character inside a blurred emphasized bubble. The overall acting was quite good but the special effects were just plain annoying not horrible, annoying. The costumes, design, and acting was great, the special effects were what was lacking."
3,History in the Making,"From a historial point of view this DVD is interesting. From an artistic video point of view it is disppointing. There is too much confusion with the dual portrayal of World Leaders. It takes time to understand what is going on. This story is pure history and would be useful for students, history teachers and writers. Michal Caine was excellet playing the part of Stalin."
2,NOTHING BUT TALKING,"The acting is great, I got to admit. That's the only reason I gave this movie two stars. But the movie was BORING AND TOO LONG. It may be a good film for old people. But kids BEWARE! It would bore them to tears."
3,Enjoyable historical movie.,"This mini-series was very enjoyable. Not really traditional Hollywood style though. Several of the shot compositions were a bit cheesy. Also, the main characters did a strange soap-operaesque pause while another character (in another location) was talking. The splicing didn't make sense to me.The acting was fine and Michael Caine's accent was believable. I think he humanized the Stalin character enormously.One character that I did miss was Truman. The movie basically stops with the death of FDR. While I understand that Truman was ""out-of-the-loop"" while VP, he was nevertheless a wartime president.Overall, I would recommend this movie. Although, I would only purchase it on sale or rent it."
1,No codes,"I bought this so I could mess around with Sonic Adventures 2 Battle, only to find that you can't enter codes."
1,before you buy,"I have to give this a one star rating in hopes that people will read this. I have a wii system and although this is advertised wii compatible, IT IS NOT WII COMPATIBLE. You might be okay if you have one of the first wiis that were produced and have never taken it online and have not played any new wii game. The updates for the system make it so you cannot use any cheat devices. It wont even work for playing gamecube games. If you want to cheat on a gamecube game, use a gamecube."
2,Preset kills product,The only thing that disappointed me about this was that you can't enter in your own codes. It's stuck with preset ones.
5,Action Replay,"Action Replays work great for any systems I've owned them for. Just check the sellers comments, a lot of people are selling these for GC and you think your getting the older version that has a memory card you can add codes on with and your actually getting the newer model with no memory card. So if you want the old one, there are many reasons to want an older version, make sure you look at what your buying and read the sellers comments. But as far as useability, they are easy to use, codes can be long, but life can't be that easy for you, and they work. Great for young gamers, or those who don't have time to ""level""."
1,Not what I was looking for.,It works but not like YOU WANT IT TO WORK. YOU CAN ONLY USE WHATS ALREADY WRITTEN ON IT. Only Action Replay Version 1 will allow you to update new codes. I didn't get that version and it cost me. Live and Learn.
2,Can't add codes,"This thing sucks. You can only use preinstalled codes and most of those suck. I got it because its impossible to find a GBA action replay and I was gonna use it to hack a few Pokemon on Colosseum or XD but I couldn't. They deliberately don't put on the package that you can't put in new codes because it would lower sales. It does however have a lot of games to choose from, but that's about the only good thing this thing has going for it."
5,Son loves it!,"Son is so glad to have the GameCube Action Replay - It enhances game play, opens areas that were closed, including characters, videos, etc. depending on the game played with."
5,GameCube Action Replay,Excellent item! This is really an amazing item that anybody could buy for their very own personal time and pleasure.
1,Worthless Junk,"I bought this hoping it would work like my PS2 and Nintendo DS, after I tried like 10 times to get it to work with the Wii I found out that it doesn't work with a majority of games I own, also you cant add your own codes!!! this is worthless dont wastes your money on this crap!"
3,Check the version!!!,"I don't think many reviewers realized they were leaving feedback on the wrong item. Action Replay is a great tool for other systems. I've been very pleased with all other systems I've invested in the device for. Gamecube is NOT so fortunate. For gamecube, the action replay MAX is the device that allows self-input codes in addition to the preloaded ones, and seems to be somewhat rare, and thus hideously expensive. This is another version of the device where you can ONLY use the preloaded codes. I had never suspected they would make a device so useless. If the code you want is preloaded, GREAT! But don't expect to be able to do manual input of codes you find online, as with other Action Replay products."
1,Not worth it.,"I was very excited to buy this, I just raided amazon, buying all my old favorite GameCube games, when I decided, ""HEY, LET'S BUY AND ACTION REPLAY!!!!!1111Oneoneone.""It came....And I wasn't to thrilled, there's two huge gashes across the disk.BUT GUESS WHAT.I can't even find out if it's from the gashes that it doesn't work for my Gamecube, because and I quote ""Unfortunately, there are some compatibility issues with Action Replay Version 1.20 and some models of the GameCube."" --Datel.Great."
1,Waste of money,"My 10 year old son purchased this with his own money and was VERY disappointed. He bought it for use on the WII but didn't realize that it can only be used with a few ""preset"" codes. No new codes can NOT be added and the games he wanted to use it with were not even listed on the device. It was a total waste of his hard earned money. Don't bother with it!"
2,I was disappointed when it came in the mail,I do not recommend buying this unless you are okay with a very limited amount of cheats. You can't add to the list of cheats that it has in the disk and it has a very lame amount of cheats for most games. Also when you try to start the disk on your WII sometimes it restarts and you have to start it again. I do not recommend this item at all mainly because I was exited about adding some codes on to it that I found on the internet. if you really want to buy an action replay you should buy the one that works for the GameCube only.
1,This product is a piece of crap,This action replay is a piece of crap unlike the older editions for this version you cannot input your own codes. BEWARE!!! of action replay version 1.2
4,Unhappy,"My sons Gamecube was only 13 months old when after using this accessory for a couple of weeks, his system no longer worked. The people at Nintendo suggested that Action replay could be the culprit. Buyer beware."
3,A wrong one have been shipped,"I ordered a Stereo Adaptor, but I received a Mono one. It is not the same thing which on the picture.Also, it looks very cheap."
3,Hosa GPM-103,"This little guy gets the job done, its not expensive at all and I'm about to order my second one.####Update:Okay, I ordered my second adapter and it came in, guess what? The product was defective, the 3.5mm jack wouldn't fit, seems like something is messed up internally. I contacted them via e-mail, hope all goes well!***Update 9/9/11***I have contacted the sellers and they sent another one... which was defective as well, I gave up. I haven't had a chance to update the review but, I contacted them a while ago and they sent yet another defective product. Your taking a chance when buying these, try to buy at least 2 to ensure yourself at least 1 useful adapter.( Taking 1 star off for bad quality)[ * * * - - ]"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,You truly get what you pay for when it comes to these. I ordered two of these because I knew the were cheap. BOTH OF THEM FELL APART THE FIRST DAY I USED THEM!! These are obviously some cheap crap ordered from some china website that sells knock off goods. If they didnt fall apart when you use them they would be great. Too bad I can't give these zero stars or I would. Highly frustrating. Spend a couple dollars more and get a quality adapter. Don't be tempted by the price.
1,Save your money,"Before you click ""Add to Cart"" remove a dollar bill from your wallet and throw it away..then go purchase a Monster adapter. If someone would have told me that, I would have saved a dollar and ended up with an adapter that works. This little gem was broken before it started production runs. It does not lock into the 1/4"" socket, female socket breaks contact and pops/loses signal and the plastic molding breaks away from the male end. I couldn't even use it. I ended up purchasing a Monster brand adapter for $15. You get what you pay for..."
5,Adaptor was the solution,Needed the produce to connect my Bose earphones to an electric piano. This adaptor did the trick. Have had no problems with it.
4,Works pretty well,I use this as an adapter for a UHF mic and it worked pretty well. It's hard to know exactly what causes problems whether the hardware or adapter or cords.
2,Didn't last,Worked fine at first and was amazed at the price. But after using it a few times it now pops out when I try to plug into the guitar amp.
2,It's OK,"The quality is OK, but it is about 2mm shorter than regular 1/4"" plugs, such as one came with my Sony V6 headphones, and another adapter I bought somewhere else. Because of the length is too short sometimes it comes out of the socket by itself!"
1,not made of the right stuff,Don't buy these adapters. The plastic body is made of a very brittle plastic that breaks easily. I bought 12 for a project I was doing and about half of them are broken. Spend a little more to get all metal adapters.
3,Good adapter,"I bought this adapter to work on a DELL or Bose speaker connection. I thought my earbud headphone plug was too small. But, it was just to short. So, I bought a pair with a longer 3.5mm plug and they work very well. I will keep the larger 1/4"" because the price was very low and I will have the larger size, if I need it."
2,"This is a 3.5mm to 1/4"" adaptor but it's not a Hosa GPM-103","I ordered this item last week and it arrived inside a small clear plastic pouch packaging, not the normal Hosa packaging with the cardboard showing the Hosa name and the model number. The plastic packaging looked very cheap and there was nothing that showed that this was in any way a Hosa item. The adaptor looked flimsy and of poor quality, with the black plastic casing not cleanly trimmed and polished.I ordered this item because I believed it was a Hosa. This is not a Hosa. The title and description of this item are deceptive. I would have returned the item but, because of the cheap price, I didn't bother spending the time to ship it back.Two positives for this item: my order arrived promptly and the product works so far, though it doesn't look like it will last long."
2,It is pretty cheap,"I ended up just buying another one of these plugs, the adapter fit pretty loose, and I heard a little noise when the cord shifted on my headphones, i reccomend buying an adapter that costs a little more, and save the hassle."
3,good product for the money,The product is what was advertised. A simple no frills adapter plug. It works and the price is good.It was shipped promptly as well.What's not to like ?!
2,Diasppointed,"I would have hoped that my now Amazon would have switched to American made electronics. The adaptor works for now, but I expect that it will break or stop working within 6 months. That is about the length of time for Chinese made products to last. In the future, I would hope that Amazon would identify the country of origin for its electronics so that people could know whether the product was of adequate quality."
1,"Cheap, but also bad quality",Product came in good condition but my headphone jack wouldn't fit right so sound only came out of one ear. I would not recommend buying this product.
2,Buy three,"One good, one bad, good one is not all that good ... that is why I bought two ... have bought various ""makes"" with much the same results ... failure out of the box, or after use for a whileStill don't under stand why no one make a cable which goes from phono plug to mini plug, with cable length to order ... maybe it is up to ME !!"
5,Great price. Works perfectly.,You can't go wrong for the price. Received the adaptor very quickly and it works. What else can I say?
5,AWESOME!,I use a Marshall head with a matching cab. I used to use 1/8 instrument cables. It honestly did sound funny. I didn't want to go to a music shop or electronics store because I'm super lazy and whatnot. :p Waited two days and this thing arrived in the mail. ITS FREAKING THICK MAN! just buy it. :D
4,Right the first time,This book was needed for my son's music class. It came quickly and was not over packed. I appreciate the correct labeling and the picture that was supplied so that I did not end up having to overpay for this product as the teacher seemed to want.
5,Flute Book 1,"Item came as described, brand new. My daughter uses her flute book everyday. Thank you!"
4,flute book,"this music book was bought for my 11 year old who is starting middle school in August, and is joining the school band playing the flute..."
2,Wrong Item,The brief case that was sent is not the one that was ordered. The one that was sent doesn't have the flap over and has horses stamped into the leather.
5,Dora!,"My daughter loves playing with this set. There's not much to do with the toys as there is no articulation.The ball is part of Dora's foot, which was a bit of a bummer for my daughter, but otherwise, it's a good litle toy."
4,Comfortable and agile,"These gloves are thin enough to pick up a dime with. Very comfortable, lightweight. Wonderful for driving or covering your hands on public transit. Don't expect that they will keep your hands warm, as they are not lined. They do what driving gloves should do, however, and fit like a glove, pun intended."
5,Good fit,"Affordable price, great fit. XL is the right size for big hands. Small velcro strap on back is perfect for a snug fit."
2,BOUGHT FOR DUTY GLOVES,FOUND THESE TO BE TOO SLIPPERY FOR HANDLING FIREARMS. WE TESTED A BUNCH OF DRIVING GLOVES AND FOUND THE FOLLOWING WORKED BEST. 2x Traditional Leather Driving Gloves Size L Color BLK By Pratt and Hart (RS6738) THEY FIGHT SNUG AND HAVE GOOD GRIP.
1,Taste Terrible.,"I have 3 year old triplet grandchildren that started preschool in September 2011. Being in 3 different classes they are always catching colds. They are all pretty good with taking medicine. So when I heard this was very good for children, that it helps build their immune and taste good I figured I'd try it. One taste and they were gaging. So I tasted it, The taste was terrible!"
1,About as Useful as Toilet Paper,"This book looks like it was written by a 13 year old, hormone driven little boy. There is no way I would suggest anyone buy this book. Save your money for the Labotomy you will need after reading it."
1,pathetic fantasies of the hopeless,"Luckily I never had to purchase this book. I thought it was a joke when I glanced at it, but surprised to find it being sold online. Lady's and Gentlemen, this is not poetry, it's garbage. However give the guy credit, he had enough guts to publish his own material."
3,Hahahaha,"I read this book and it reminded me of a High School boys fantasies written on paper. However, it's out and it's an object of opinion. You'll have to read it to appreciate what it has to offer. I'm not a big fan of poetry but I started with this one. I'm going to have to broaden my horizons in order to rate this book any higer."
4,Not bad at all,"While I will respect the poet's desire to remain anonamous, I will bring to light that I had the pleasure of serving with him on board the USS Curtis Wilbur. Most of what you read was written while deployed in the Persian Gulf. If it seems a little too emotional at times, think of your emotions two continents and two oceans away from your friends and family for six months. This book was started in the Gulf on a deployment that was not supposed to take us there. We got the call, we went, and Heartsender wrote. This is real emotion as real as it gets. It was written inbetween ship boardings, and run ins with the Iranian Navy. The poet still serves, and I am proud to still serve with him. If you support the troops, you must support their feelings. This book is Heartsender's feelings. This book is Heartsender"
2,good for families only,"This book is good for families with small children. The first four chapters are nothing but etiquette about pregnancy, birth, infants, and toddlers. The rest of the book seems to be mostly about how to teach your children good manners.If you're looking for a general good etiquette book, this is not it."
2,annoying hum,"I purchased this radio for my bathroom. It is powerful and sleek but when unit is off .. it hums, too annoying for me, I returned it."
4,Large clock radio,"The sound quality is very good, as well as can be expected for the price. The reception on AM and FM is above average and the CD reproduction is equally as good. My two objections are no AM-FM selection on the very large remote and no time signal when the radio or cd is on. If this and the bright display at night does not bother you the Teac is a very good buy for a bedside or den radio/cd player."
3,just okay,Good radio and CD player. But it doesn't play most MP3 cds that my other system plays. It was also gigantic so try to get an accurate measurement before you buy this. Not a typical bedside radio. The system sounds great though. I think it's not worth the tag price.
3,Teac Radio/CD Player,Rating To Be Determined. The radio arrived damaged. I followed the instructions for returning the damaged item delivered. It was a pretty straight forward process. I am supposed to receive a replacement in September and will be able to give an appraisal of the Player then.
3,Interesting,"I don't have it in front of me, but I believe this book was actually first published in 1877. It's somewhat of a scholarly work. I enjoy reading the old English. I'm sure it was used in many piano tuning guilds.Piano Servicing, Tuning, and Rebuilding, Second Edition : for the Professional, the Student, and the Hobbyist (Paperback) by Arthur Reblitz is a more current book that covers tuning pianos in depth.But this one's a gem. Obviously, or it wouldn't still be around over 100 years after it was written."
2,"okay, but not nearly informaative enough",this book was not NEARLY informative as I thought it was going to be
3,Piano Tuning,"I have not attempted to tune my own piano, but this book made me more informed about my instrument"
3,A better source for tuning info,"Fundamentals of Piano Practiceis a better, modern source. Chromatic scale, intervals, Circle of Fifths, Temperaments (Well, Meantone, Equal, Pythagorean, Kirnberger, etc.) are explained mathematically and in practical (music, tuning) terms. Details of how an inexperienced amateur might start to learn. However, tuning requires practice, precision and patience (not good ears as many believe), so is not for everyone - how many pianos does an amateur get to practice on? This is a chapter in book on learning piano, improving your memory, raising your IQ, learning Mental Play (which is what ""geniuses"" used for their absolute pitch, composing, memorizing, performing skills, etc.) that anyone can learn, much more. The main content of the book is VERY fast piano technique acquisition."
3,Entertaining but not as good as the first,"The ""My Father's Dragon"" books are good fun, but quirky. The author has given ""my father"" a name (Elmer). Most of the action in this sequel occurs on ""Feather Island,"" which can drag on in places. The book is a little misnamed, because it's really about Elmer and the dragon's trip to Feather Island and what they do there. Some of the authorial quirks--like a tangerine-only diet, with the exact number of tangerines counted out--have gotten a little old. Our little boy was squirming a lot more in this one than in the first. But we read it to the end, and the end is very satisfying. Not at all a bad book. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars.Note, having started book #3 in the series (The Dragons of Blueland), I note that it is possible to skip #2 without really missing a beat. You may or may not want to, but there's actually a nice plot continuity, since the beginning of #3 has the dragon flying away from Elmer's home."
5,WOW,"My third grade class read all three of the books in thisseries. They loved them all. My Father's Dragon was the most excitingand the favorite one. It was a great way to encourage my third graders to jump into a chapter book, even the hesitant ones."
1,Not Impressed!,"I was in desperate need of a new baby monitor. I bought this one because of two reasons: the 900 Mhz technology and for the detachable monitor. Unfortunately, this product did not meet my expectations. First, the charging base on the monitor never kept the battery charged and after only 2 weeks of use, failed to work at all! It constanlty flashed red and then stopped flashing permanently. As for the reception, it was just so so. I got a lot of static and was not able to hear my daughter breathing or moving (she co-sleeps on my bed). For me, I need a monitor that is noise sensitive and reliable. We live in a rural area and have a one story house. A 900 Mhz monitor should have no problem in this type of setting. I returned the product and am going to go with the new 2.4 Ghz model."
2,*Almost great* BUT has a major flaw,"The major flaw is with the PARENT unit. Unlike the child unit, the parent unit does NOT have a charging mechanism. It runs on 4 AAA batteries. I figured ""OK, just buy rechargeable batteries."" But the unit drains the batteries really fast AND it takes a SCREW DRIVER to change the batteries. If it was once a month or so, no big deal, but the batteries will die in a day or two, especailly if you forget and leave the unit on after nap time. IF this product had a parent unit to match the child unit with a handy charging base and rechargeable batteries, i'd give the system 5 stars. We're returning this item. Don't waste your time."
2,Buy another monitor! Too many problems!,"I am the mother of three and have had good monitors before. I bought this one with my third baby and immediately started having problems with it. Every so often the base unit doesn't line up correctly and shows that its not charged when it is. The receiver part has to be plugged in all the time. If not, then you will go through batteries every couple days. Very expensive. I will say that its clear for the most part, that's why I gave it two stars, but after having this for less than 7 months it is starting to make strange static noises and I must buy a new monitor. Save your money and look for another one. This one is poorly designed."
3,Second Monitor Home,"We purchased a second monitor for our home because of baby #2. This monitor does not interfere with the First Years monitor we have. We also like that it is portable and ""wireless"". The sound quality is excellent-I can hear her hiccup.What we do not like: the parent unit is not rechargeable and eats batteries weekly, so we keep it on the cord. I can never tell if the baby unit is done charging because the red light stays on all the time. And finally we will return it because it is shorting in and out and you can't always hear the sounds even though the lights work. We have only used this monitor for 5 weeks."
1,This a bitter lemon,"As a electrical engineer and pround new father of a baby girl, I am more than disappointed with this product. It did not work out of the box. With a 10 hour fully charged battery in the baby unit and brand new 4 AAAs in the parent unit the range was 1 foot (with or without the AC adapter plugged into it), on both A and B channels. If you buy this brand & model and have good luck that is great but why take the chance? For me it is back to the store to exchange this for something better, but first I will read the opinions, something I should have done in the first place. Best fo luck to you."
3,"Nice concept, but I've tried 3 and all have been broken.","I really like the concept of being able to move the child unit since my baby sleeps in different areas of the house and we have had no problems with reception. However, I have replaced it 3 times now because the charging light on the base of the child unit has always had something wrong. If I knew the charger was working, I could live with replacing batteries on the parent unit. But, I figure 3 tries is enough and will be returning this last one for a different brand that hopefully works."
3,"Works great, but design of Parent unit needs work","I've had this for 16 mos and have loved the way its worked. However the Parent unit not having rechargable batteries is an issue. I did buy really, really powerful rechargeable batteries and the Parent unit still drains them too fast. Other than that, its been a great monitor. I recently contacted the manufacturer to find a replacement battery for the child unit (it had finally wore out) and they sent me a battery for the unit FREE OF CHARGE, it came via mail, just a week after my request in the mail. Really nice and fast too! Overall this unit works fine, but if you can find one w/rechargable parent unit, I would go that route instead."
2,Charging Base Problems also!,"The clarity of this monitor is great, but after only 3 months of use I had to return it to the store because of a problem with the charging base. The transmitter would not charge nor would it work just sitting on the base.I loved the idea of the attachable base and again the clarity that I experienced with this monitor was great. Unforunately, I cannot recommend this product because it sounds like from my experience and other peoples experience First Years has a problem with this monitor."
1,Major design error!,"We can't figure out why the baby unit is rechargeable but NOT the parent's unit....It seems like it would make more sense the other way around because the parent may want to walk around with the unit. This has been frustrating when we use it at the grandparent's house, and we have to keep plugging/unplugging the parent unit whenever we move around the house. Recharging the baby unit seems not as necessary as that unit usually is stationary. The parent unit can take batteries but you have to use a screwdriver to open the case up. Otherwise, reception seems to be ok (though we don't use it over long distances), and the LED indicators for sounds are useful."
3,"Works well, but why not rechargeable batteries?","Good monitor, good range, but the parent's unit should have a rechargeable battery that both recharges and works from the a/c while plugged in. BAtteries need to be replaced every 5 days on our unit."
1,Monitor quit working after about a two weeks!!!,"We got this monitor as a baby shower gift. It worked for about a week and then it stopped. The only thing that works is the lights, but there is no sound. I wouldn't recommend this product to any parent. This kind of failure in a product of this type is inexcusable."
2,WORKS WELL FOR STATIC!!!,"Unless you are listening for static instead of a crying baby, I suggest passing on this product!!! It worked great for the first few months but after that you could only hear static"
1,Lots of static noise,"This monitor picks up all wireless noises because it is not digital - anything: cell phones, appliances, etc will render it virtually unusable. Why would not they make digital monitors? A digital wireless phone with monitor function would be a better solution."
3,Worked well for 18 month.. there is no sound now,As I mentioned above this monitor worked very well for us then after about 16 month the sound started to fade away and after 18 month completely disappeared. We used it only during naps and early night hours. I'd like this product to last longer that's why I gave 3 stars.
4,"I like this monitor, very convenient....",I am able to use this monitor whether my son is in his crib or in our living room in his swing. The child unit charges on a charger and then can be moved from room to room as needed. The parent unit can be used by battery or plugged in. We have had no issues with it and really like it.
3,Not ment for jogging,"Baby Trend Expedition LX Jogging Stroller, SkylarI bought this stroller less then 6 months ago and now we are looking to purchase a differnt one. It was for our first child and we decided to buy the entire travel system. The car seat portion has been fine but the stroller itself has been a big disapointment. First of all we were looking for a stroller that would work well in most terrain, as we are very active people. It is very tippy even on a regular sidewalk. Second, it is not ment for jogging or even a fast walk. It wobbles all over the place and is very annoying. If I were looking to purchase a Jogging stroller again I would definatly spend a little more money and get a quality stroller. This was not what I was looking for."
3,"Safe, but difficult to manuever","I got this stroller as part of the travel system. The carseat got some of the best safety reviews and I thought I would prefer a jogging stroller to a regular full-size stroller. I am not a jogger, but do like to take walks on bike trails and this stroller has worked great for that. The first problem we had with it was that it does not fit in my trunk. It is also very hard to steer and it pulls to one side, so you are constantly re-adjusting it. I wish I had known that they make joggers with swiveling front wheels. It is very sturdy and does really well on uneven pavement or loose gravel."
1,Frame bent on first try,"I was so excited when I bought this stroller. I put it together and took it for a test run with my 2-year-old daughter in it. I had gotten as far as my neighbor's house, when the frame holding up the front wheel became twisted causing the front wheel to fall off. I didn't go over any major bumps. I have never seen anything like this in my life. Thank goodness my daughter was not injured."
5,Works Great!,"I run this from an acoutic guitar amp and into my laptop and it records flawlessly with very little static or noise.The quality seems pretty good and so far, after two months or so it's still going strong.Two thumbs up!"
5,Decent cable,"This is a basic adaptor cable; 1/4 "" stereo male to 1/8"" stereo male. It is soft, supple, and not noisey; excellent for an inexpensive cable of this length. I use it with a guitar and iPhone, using a Griffen adaptor and the modded output as an effects box going into an old Rickenbacker guitar amp. So far no problems."
5,Easy Guide to Sewing Pants,"Having bought and looked at a number of different books to help me with fitting pants/slacks, including those by Palmer/Pletsch, Gale Griggs and others, I kinda gave up. I needed a guide in plain English, easy to use, and not overwhelming. In other words, a tool I would use. I picked up this book, ""Easy Guide to Sewing Pants,"" at the library just because it was there. After reading and using it, I am greatly impressed! Have tried fitting my first pair of pants for my mother and they were perfect! Fit, ease, grain, hang of legs were absolutely perfect. This book purchase is a definite boon to my sewing library. I highly recommend this book to all of us who wish to learn more about the art of fitting slacks/pants."
1,Poorly Made,I ordered this product knowing it would be handy and in truth its a great idea. I also ordered the matching batterey holder too. Both arrived both are sold by same company. But the batterey holder is made in the USA and the card holder is made in China. The quality control in China is sadly lacking. The straps where the velcro are adheared too are too short thus keeping you from getting a secure fit and in addition the quality of the velcro must be less as well because they dont stick well. Returning as junk. In fact the batterey holder is only slightly larger then a card holder so why have both it will easily work as a card holder too. Make them all in the USA if you can. If you can do one you can do both here.
5,OP/Tech Media Holster,"Overall I like them and have a few. Unlike their battery holsters, these holster are a little larger thereby allowing the option of storing CF cards in their protective plastic cases, which I like to do for added protection. Kodos to OP/TECH. Just make your battery holsters as functional."
1,"Worked, but didn't last long.","I bought this from Target under a different name. It came in a set with a crank flashlight. The radio actually worked for me in the beginning. I used it for about 4 months. Then the crank broke. To be precise, the gears inside broke. When it worked, this was really a decent radio with good reception (well, for $10) but I threw it away after it broke since it really had no use anymore. If they would have only spent a few more cents on it, and put in metal gears, this could have been a useful, sturdy little radio."
1,Don't buy the Innovage Outdoor crank radio--it doesn't work,"I bought the Innovage Outdoor crank radio thinking it would be great to have in the event of a power outage. Following the instructions, the ""CHARGING"" light comes on but the ""FULL"" light never does despite cranking it for several minutes. The instructions say you should only need to crank it for a short time. Even after several minutes of cranking, you don't hear a thing. Don't waste your money on this!"
1,Avoid.,"I bought the Innovage crank radio last summer, and recently disposed of it, generally unhappy with its performance. Was never able to pull in a single NOAA station--and I live in a state capital. FM reception was poor. Cranking for 90 seconds gave me about 5+ minutes of charge. But the final straw was the tuning dial, which became frozen; I was unable to tune it. There are better emergency crank radios out there, usually costing a bit more. I was in a cheap mood when I bought this; I will not be again when shopping for a replacement."
1,quit working,The on/off/vol knob quit working soon after I bought it...radio won't do anything. Wish I hadn't bought it.
1,poor,"Do not buy this radio. The hand crank option failed to work on the one I purchased, which would seem to defeat the purpose of owning it. In addition, it is impossible to contact the manufacturer regarding a replacement. This is the second problem I have had with products from this company, as I also purchased a flashlight that did not work. Avoid Innovage Outdoor."
1,Deserves Just One Star,"The purpose for buying this radio is the hand crank feature. For the one I bought, after the factory charge died, the hand crankdid not recharge. In addition I tried a charger, but it also failed to do the job. All that worked was batteries.This item is marketed under a number of names including Jensen, Innovage, and Lifelong. They're all the same radio except for the name. From other reviews I would gather that you can get a good one but that's an iffy situation.Oh well, I bought it just to play around with it anyway."
1,Innovage Battery Free Crank Radio,"The battery free portion of this radio failed to work for more than two minutes at a time after cranking for nearly one half hour. When placing batteries in the radio, it works fine, but it defeats the main purpose of an emergency radio when no batteries are available. I had to remove the Ni-MH storage batteries and replace them by re-soldering them in place. This is my second one of these radios, the first one works just fine."
2,A little anemic,"To be honest with you, I was expecting better than this, but then, what do you expect for fourteen bucks. It's a handy little radio, and I do like the crank system. Nothing is more irritating than listening to a ball game while you are fishing and have the batteries give out. But with this little radio, crank it and presto! You got power.Now for the downside. The tuner is unbelievably poor. Even strong stations are hard to tune in. Trying to tune in weak station? Forget it. Also, the tone is very tinny. It does, however, serve it's purpose however- a general purpose portable radio which you will never lose power. But if I had to do it again, I would spend more money and buy a better radio."
3,bad fitting,Plastic to thick doesn't glue correctly parts don't really match. Parts don't have a. Clean cut when taken off the part rack
4,A Fun Build for Any Modeler,"This model is essentially the same as it was in the early 80s when it first went on sale, meaning you won't find modern features like recessed panel lines and a vacuum molded canopy, but all the parts fit together properly, making it a better choice than other F-14 models with variable geometry wings. It is a great build out of the box for intermediate modelers, and expert modelers armed with sandpaper and a sharp knife can turn it into a fantastic display piece. Anyone interested in creating an extremely accurate F-14 will, however, need to purchase an additional sheet of decals, as the kit only includes the numerals, insignia, and a few panels.Overall, I highly recommend this model for intermediate modelers and experts alike, with the stipulation that extra decals will be necessary to create an entirely accurate replica."
5,Nothing but praise for this small book...,"This little book exceeds the value of its purchase price. Its excellent organization of Greek vocabulary by root and other study aids will vastly encourage and develop your Greek word power. It is dynamite! ""auton estin agathon!"""
4,New Testament Greek,One has to be a student of New Testament Greek to find this book useful. It is helpful because it groups families of Greek words---a lot of verbs especially---to enable the memory to learn their meanings and hold onto them when reading N.T. Greek and translating.
2,Disappointing in person,"I was set to buy this purse at Target, but I didn't. Even though it was on sale for $6.40, I couldn't believe how cheap it looked. Maybe I'll wait for another price drop and buy it them :)"
3,Cute but a little difficult to maneuver,"This toy is well made and very handy in the carrying bag. Perhaps my 19mo old is too young, but the rings supplied to toss over the ""branches"" of the tree don't have big enough centers. It is a clever design, and could be just fine for older children. I was looking for something a 2 and 3 yr old might play together, and this didn't quite make it."
1,Relaxing or annoying?,"I bought this CD from Zellers for just $7, thinking I was getting a good deal. I figured that since I like relaxing, kind of New Age-y music, this would be a good one for me to buy. I turned out to be wrong. The sound effects either sound really fake or like something from a cartoon science-fiction movie. The instruments are obviously from a synthesizer. There is a sound error in Track 3. The melodies themselves are repetitive, unoriginal, and are almost identical to other tracks on the disc. I only listen to this CD for laughs now. And soon after, I realized the songs are exactly like the ones from my mom's yoga DVD."
1,my write desk has not yet shipped,I am not sure why Amazon says it would ship in 24 hours when it has been more than 2 weeks and still they have not shipped. It is frustrating to see false advertisements from a public company.
4,Very fun! Great Coach's gift,Perfect for the water polo player or fan at your house; also would make a fantastic coach's gift...something a coach could really use! I bought this for my son and my nephew; both are polo players and both really liked the notebook. Something different from the every day notebooks available for school!
4,Mikasa Water Polo Dry Erase Board With(out) Pen,Good Product... what I expected to be. Please be aware that no pen or marker comes with the board! There are no signs that there even was one.
4,Very handy,Not sure why these things are more readily available. The quality seems to be fine; the convenience factor is high considering it allows Boss effects pedals (or any others with jacks on the sides) to be spaced closer together on a pedal board.I bought an extra!
4,Good cables,"I got a couple from a small guitar shop. The cable seems more flexible than the standard plastic coated ones and works great, sound-wise."
4,Hmm,"This works but jack does not go in all the way on certain pedals, including the Cry Baby Wah pedal. Why these don't work on probably the most popular pedal in the world is beyond me. Works like any other cable for my other pedals though (Zoom and Danelectro)."
3,Good Concept,"I used this cable for about a month or so, and still have it hooked up on some pedals I no longer use. Great idea, but the space it saves vertically it wastes horizontally, so if you use a pedal with a DC input near a jack, or stero in/out there may not be enough room for both to fit properly because these are so wide. On mine, one side of the connection rattles a bit but i never noticed an effect on the signal. Decent product, but could do with a bit of refining."
2,Could be my fault...,"I got a few of these about a year ago, and they seemed to work fine for a while. I chucked them in the back of my amp, as I don't have a pedalboard, and they would always get stuck to the speaker, which I suppose is magnetic. I'm not sure if the magnetism messed something up inside of them or what, but one doesn't work anymore, and the other one is extremely fuzzy, and if moved at all, it creates a horrible buzzing sound (like when you plug your guitar in with your amp on). It's absolutely unusable now. The actual jack is loose too, and it spins and can be shaken within the head clamp.I'm not sure if it was the magnet that caused this to happen, or if they were just cheaply made and unreliable, but they were very cheap, so I wasn't too bothered. I ended up buying much higher quality 6 inches and can notice the difference, but for a couple bucks, this is a fine choice. Buy some extras for new pedals, backups, ect."
3,An OK paper trimmer,"I needed a regular paper cutter for home use. I volunteer to do a lot of projects for all the things my kids are in. I was disappointed in this. The top edge is a little rounded which makes it harder to line the paper up for a straight cut. The lines on the bottom that are supposed to help you align the paper change a few inches down from centimeters to inches making it even harder to line up the paper. It cuts good, but you really have to practice to get it to cut straight."
2,For completists only,"This is one of my two least favorite NRPS albums. The band had essentially broken up, only to be rebuilt by John ""Marmaduke"" Dawson, the only remaining original member. This recording serves to document the 1982 line-up, which is far inferior to both earlier and later line-ups. Nevertheless, it's not unlistenable, just unremarkable. It sounds mostly like an early 1980's club band. ""Rainbow"" is the best track, a much slower arrangement than they previously recorded. Overall, the old NRPS magic was missing."
2,Outputs only one channel.,"I concur with the previous poster. The mono output is the left stereo channel only, the right stereo channel is ignored."
1,Does not match description,"This product was advertised to take the 2 input stereo channels and sum them to a single mono output. In fact, only one channel was sent through the output... totally worthless to me.The seller was quick on delivery, just did not do what it advertised."
4,really useful. a must for the casual playstation fan,"with so few cheat devices on the market still compatible with the playstation 1, this device was a welcome sight.especially useful since i find myself using this on games i just have fun playing.not really for the ""playstation 1 initiate,"" but for a veteran like me, it's just fun to go all my old games unstoppably."
4,"works on PS1, might not work on PS2","its not bad, I've tested this on my PSOne and the cheat codes I've tried all worked, the Action Replay also lets you play the music and movies on your PS1 discs, so you can watch cutscenes or even the endings as many times as you wantthe Action Replay however didn't work on my PS2, I like playing PS1 games on it cause I use the fast loading and smooth texture options, I don't know if the Action Replay is compatible with certain models, but it doesn't work on the 50001 model PS2"
4,Finally One That Enhances PS1 Games on PS2,I was please to see that Intec finally has a game enhancer for a Playstation 1 game that works on the PS2. Be warned however - the interface on entering codes is a little clumsy (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). You enter the codes like on a dial (scroll up and down) instead of on a keypad like most cheat devices. But hey - it still works and I am happy to see it!
3,did not work still figuring out why,"After trying out AR MAX for PS2, I decided to try this for PSOne console I have.Interface is little less intuitive and I haven't figured out a way to enable only part of cheat. One time I tried to play Metal gear solid snake and it didn't work."
5,Niece Loved it!,"I purchased this Raggedy Ann, as well as Raggedy Andy for my niece for Christmas. The bright colors are beautiful! She loved it. Easy transaction, fast shipping...great product!!"
5,"Durable, but soft",This Raggedy Ann doll is very durable and the colors are vivid and bright. I know it will have a long life around this house and we will be playing with her for many years.
3,Baby Gift,Needed these for nursery decorations for my grandbaby's nursery. Worked great for this purpose.
1,NO BUTTON EYES! Item description wrong.,"The product description is a lie. The eyes are not button eyes, as described. The only reason I decided to order this particular doll was to get one with button eyes. The dolls from the 60's had really pretty black button eyes. This doesn't even come close to the description. Out of the box, my second impression (after being disappointed about the eyes) was ""Cheap""."
3,NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING!,"The doll is a little smaller than what I was expecting. However, it is for my great niece and she is just 6 months old. Amazon write the size of the items a little clearer."
3,Not as expected,"I was picturing the same sized doll that I grew up with and this is much smaller than I had imagined. Yes, the description does say that it is only twelve inches so I guess it is my fault for not paying closer attention to the description. I do like the shiny button eyes but the quality seems much lower than the ones of yesteryear."
4,If you like the book,"I know that this is an excellent version of the BOOK, but I am the type who wants to forget the book. That is why I liked Daniel Day-Lewis' version so much better; the ending was different! And you had that beautiful song by Clannad. That is why I only give THIS version 4 stars. That aside, it is terrific for purists and lovers of vintage Masterpiece Theater. My parents fall into this latter category which is why I am buying this for them as a present."
2,Felt Disappointed,"My husband and I were really looking forward to this but when it arrived and we started to watch it it was just too dated and lost our interest immediately. We should have payed more attention to the date of this series. We were expecting something more to the caliber of the Lewis and Clark series. It was just too hard to watch indians with english accents and great grammar. Also, the color was really faded. All in all we would not recommend investing in this series."
2,Dull and Boring,"This version of Last of the Mohicans was very dull, boring, and unrealistic. It lacked the quality of other movies of the same name and gave poor examples of the Native Americans. Example; Native Americans did not scalp to release the spirit of their enemy. Also some of the dancing and drum beats were not authentic and made the Native Americans look very barbaric. The acting was dull and boring as well and without a musical score only added to the dullness. I would not recommend this movie for entertainment."
4,BBC's Mohicans,"Brilliant - I've been waiting for this version of Last of the Mohicans to appear for ages, ever since 1971 in fact. It's just as good as I remember from the TV transmission, the most faithful to the book ever made, much better than the Daniel Day Lewis film which took such liberties in taking storyline from earlier big screen efforts."
4,This one actually works,"This right angle stereo connector was purchased to solve a problem associated with the placement of the footswitch input on my JamMan Looper. The output (see photo) is right up against another pedal and the cable that Digitech sends with the foot switch has a straight connector - not very smart, Digitech. Although most guitar connections are analog (mono), the foot switch requires a stereo connection, which is what this product provides.I first purchased theHosa Rt Angle Stereo/trs 1/4IN Phone PlugHosa metal right angle connector and it was a piece of junk. I think it cost about 2 bucks and I got charged five for shipping so I didn't even send it back, I just threw it away. This connector was the answer and works fine, but it still seems cheap with a plastic casing around the cable input. It's also a little bulky. However, it works so it gets 4 stars. Zero for Hosa"
5,90 degrees of Freedom make tight spaces easy.,"Good little converter that allowed me to fit cables in a very tight security box. Holds the plug tightly (very tightly) and swivels when needed. Suited my purpose perfectly but my son also uses one to flatten wires to the floor from his pedal, ignoring the stereo part."
4,not so bad,the game is fun and all that but after you beat it you'll find that it ain't that good.REASON1) bad graphic
4,It Looks cool,I am a big fan of x men and this game looks cool I have played a demo of it and it was ok but needs some more stuff added before it comes out
5,It's here and now,"Every day I see electronic privacy issues in the news. Nanny camera hacking, .coms selling previously private data, fervent calls for a national ID. If I had not read this book, I would have seen these as random stories. World Without Secrets gave me the insight to see the big picture in these events that lead us to ever increasing exposure and exploitation of the data trails we leave behind every day. Hunter has done a good job of synthesizing the threat, opportunities and strategies for dealing with this new reality."
2,Not a great wiper,"I bought the Bosch ICON Wiper Blade and the Bosch Excel+ Wiper Blade for my front windshield. I couldn't decide which one to buy so I bought one of each to compare and use. The Excel+ has held up better and wipes longer without smearing. Overall, the Excel+ has been a MUCH better blade. The ICON relatively quickly started to give small lines smears. The Excel+ works great one year later - not sure why a company would need to develop a more expensive wiper that doesn't work as well."
3,"Love 'em, leave 'em","Hey folks, I must say that I really loved these blades when I first got them in Sept 2008. They were VERY quiet, NO streaks, and I was happy.But ... here it is now: NOV 2009, and I'm in need of new wiper blades once again. I expected more than 13 months of life, considering that I drive this vehicle only 3,000 miles per year and it's kept in the carport or garage. (no sun exposure) I'm torn as to whether I'll buy them again.Like me, you probably noticed the review ratings on blades doesn't leave a lot to choose from. Apparently, this market is designed for repeat purchases at a frequent rate. (profit and/or greed) So in summary, buy these if you want great wiper for a short time. Love 'em and leave 'em."
1,Streaking like crazy,"I had to return this product. It was THAT bad. Maybe I got a defective piece, but ever since the first time I tried it, it left huge streaks. I bought two new wipers for my car (both Bosch ICON), so I know I installed them correctly as the other one works fine. I later ordered a much cheaper brand and it actually worked better. I live in Seattle, so I first thought it's a smart idea to invest in a really nice pair of windshield wiper because of the weather here. Now, I still think wiper blades are extremely important in Seattle weather, but I was wrong about Bosch ICON. I tried to be very careful with them, and I tried to clean them up every time I used them. Both wiper blades always leave black stain on my towel--not sure where the color comes from, but I don't think it's just dirt. Now, I'm keeping the longer one, cuz at the very least it worked. We'll see if the cheaper brand would continue performing better than Bosch ICON on my car."
2,Not impressed,I bought the left and right wiper of these and they streak very easily even though it says its built to resist it. They are no better than the old used cheaper stock pair of wipers that came with my 2008 Impala when I bought the car at the dealership. Actually those performed better literally.
1,"Not ""Quiet Village""","This is not the top-40's hit from the late 50's. I had to stepthrough the entire CD three times before I found ""Quiet Village"".The version on this CD is barely recognizable, and of greatlyinferior musical and artistic quality to the hit recording fromthe 50's. If you want the original top-40's hit, don't buy this!"
1,Broken,This product doesn't even work. I didn't even receive a plug to charge it.. horrible product and service!!!
2,Griffin iTrip,"I'm sorry, but this product stinks. I swore when I purchased it that it said it charged the iPod while it was in use. It does not. Either way, the iTrip drains the iPod battery so quickly, I could barely get a couple of short car rides out of it before I had to recharge it in the house again. iPod battery maybe lasted an hour to an hour and a half. And that was if you did not switch songs, but just let it play. I ended up buying the Kensington one which works so much better. Sound quality is much better, and it charges the iPod while you're using it, so no more running in the house to charge, or changing to the radio because the battery is drained. I would recommend the Kensington model to the iTrip model any day of the week!"
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I gave it one star since 0 stars was not an option. This thing didn't even work brand new, right out of the box. I spent hours updating my iPod, rebooting it, no sign of life. Looks like I'll be returning it first thing in the morning. This iTrip was supposed to replace the last one I bought, which barely worked either. I wonder if Griffin even tested these things before they put them on the market. The iTrip connector broke and was hanging out of the plastic housing. This is only after a few uses. Well, I won't be making the mistake of buying anything from Griffin again, hold on to your money."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"It's really sad when you buy something that you have some high expectations and proves to be other wise. The very problem I encountered with mine was that the transmitter did not securily hold tight to the dock connector of the ipod. Almost every time I had to rearange my ipod in my car the thing would come off and I would have to set up over and over again.The worse part is the VERY poor signal with my car stereo. I tried putting my ipod like inches away from the antena from my car and it was still had a lot of static. I have to admit that at times it sounds perfect, but nine out of ten the quality is horrible.Also if you go online for online support there is no answer regarding static and other issues. They only have to answers to two questions. I'm sure that they understand that this product of theirs is of poor quality and requires attention for improvement.I wished I saved my $40...since I refuse to use this poor quality equipment. I will not buy any other products from Griffin."
4,"Using with 3G 15GB, sounds good, sucks power.","I live in DC where there seems to be a radio station at every frequency. Luckily, I found one that doesn't interfere during my commute, 97.5. Unfortunately, this thing gives me maybe an hour of battery time. I'm trying to figure out what cord I need to get to plug it in, and Griffin's website isn't helpful.Too bad, I'll really enjoy it when I find the proper cord."
1,disappointment with iTrip,"Foolishly I allowed myself to believe that the iTrip would enable me to listen to FM transmissions while I wonder around with iPod in tow. I figured ""Griffin Technology -- can't go wrong."" Unfortunately iTrip does not serve purpose I envisioned. I am not sure exactly what its utility is. I intend to return it to vendor as soon as I have a chance.But I still believe in Griffin!"
1,Don't expect a long life with this unit,"I really wanted to have a reasonably priced FM transmitter that I could use in the car or at work. Just a month after I purchased this the unit shut off after 30 seconds of being plugged into my nano. Then, it didn't come through in stereo anymore. I can't imagine one of these lasting more than a year or two.I called the company and they were gracious enough to replace it. I was pleased with the company's service overall but the unit isn't worth it."
2,"Ordered New, Sent Used","Aside from the fact that this product works great, I am dissapointed in the fact that I made sure I ordered a new product and I am convinced it was used. It did not come in normal packaging, just a little bag. The screen had a scratch on it and it was kinda dirty. I kept it ONLY because it worked correctly but have never been so dissapointed in an amazon purchase. It was a gift for my boyfriend. I gave him the option to send it back but he said it was the thought that counts and decided to stay with it. I am very dissapointed."
2,still trying ...,"I ordered this as my second transmitter after the first one I got didn't fit my IPod. After checking to make sure I had the right model IPod, I can't get this to work in my car. It is touchy about making a connection and you can't have any kind of case on your IPod. I finally got it to turn on, but it doesn't transmit music. It may be my IPod and I haven't given up yet, but I haven't had any success either. I'm going to try it in another car and also go to the website of the manufacturer to trouble shoot. I looked there once already and it said something about resetting which I haven't tried. It wasn't that expensive, which is a plus, but this is the 2nd product I have tried. It makes me less impressed with the whole idea of using my IPod in my car - it ought to be easier than this (IMHO)."
2,Doesn't work with a case,"This will not work with some iPod cases. I had an iTrip that plugged into the top of the iPod in the headphone that I loved. It stopped working suddenly, and I never figured out why. I bought this iTrip to replace it, but because it plugs into the dock connector, it wouldn't fit with the case on my iPod. It was too annoying to deal with taking the iPod out of the case everyday to use it, so I returned it and got another one that plugs in on top."
3,"Great Product, Lousy Shipping Charges","We love the itrip transmitter and wanted to purchase another two - one for ourselves and one for a friend. However, the seller has OUTRAGEOUS shipping charges. For these two tiny items, which would easily fit in a $4 priority mail box to ship to Alaska, they are charging $19 plus per pound fees to bring the total over $20. That's unacceptable."
4,Pretty Good,"It works like it says. My only problem is the low range, i.e. having to be close to the receiver (particularly hand-held radios). Volume reception is not high in my car; I have to turn the radio way up to get a decent sound. And it gets scratchy (like a radio signal will) sometimes when I drive in certain areas.Good product for the price though."
4,Works much better than suggested by others,"I saw this and was a little nervous based on the reviews that it received but for less than $10 for a used one, I said what the hell and bought it. It works surprisingly well. I used Griffin's smartscan to find a good station to broadcast at in my area (http://stationfinder.griffintechnology.com/). I get decent range, up to ten feet but thats all i really need. When the itrip is within five feet though the quality is amazing, better than any perfectly tuned radio station. You should definitely buy this for the price it is, and if it doesn't work just return it."
3,EZ iPod FM Trans...,Inexpensive easy to install and worked well There was some possible electrical interference when the AC was running but I bought thedevise for my daughter and she has her own car a 2001 Honda Civic EXShe seems pleased with it.
3,Was refurbished not used !!!!,"I bought this iTrip as ""REFURBISHED"" but the item is used. The little screen is blurred, and is difficult to see the numbers in this screen. It`s performance is nice as the others iTrips that I have used."
2,works fine sound is ok,works fine got it on time i believe was a little confused at first but works fine sound is ok i spose
1,disappointed,"I bought the itrip because I had one previously that I lost. It is the only FM transmitter that I found to work in my car. It was reasonably priced and came fairly quickly...However, much to my disappointment the product only worked for 2 weeks and died. So, unfortunately, I now am the proud owner of a non-working itrip. I love the itrip, just wish mine were still working!!!!!"
1,"How would I know the product is ""great"" if it didn't even work?","I suppose I wouldn't know how to rate this product-since what I received was not what I ordered, in fact it wasn't even compatible with three different IPods I tried it on. The images shown were something very different from what I received. The product I purchased apparently needed an additional part to attach to the trip, to connect to iPod, which I could not buy anywhere. I gained no response from the seller when I tried to return the product that was sold to me. Poor review for a poor service from the seller."
4,Better than buying a new radio,"If your car radio doesn't have a port for your iPod and you don't want to spend $100s for a new radio, this is a good buy. It must be placed in the right area - a console near the radio works best."
3,OK for the price,"This is the second fm transmitter i've bought and is not all that much better than the other one. A friend of mine has one just like this and hers works great just not mine, theres a lot of static on all of the stations, so i opted for an aux in cable instead, is messy but sounds a lot better."
2,okay,Thsi rpoduct gets very staticy when i put it down. It either has to be touching another item for it to be working properly or must be held. basically this is like the cheap imitation.
3,iTrip,"Great product, but advertised as ""new"" when I received it without official packaging or instructions (instructions were xeroxed). This was not good as I gave it as a gift."
2,"Worked well, not very durable","The iTrip worked well but is not for clutzy users like myself.I dropped this one time & it will no longer work. I am only dinging the review b/c the fall was less than waist height (& I'm short!) onto plush carpet. So I wouldn't have expected the device to totally quit working. But it did.Obviously the iTrip is not made to be dropped, but in the future I will look for a more durable product."
2,Incompatibility Issues,"The device is clean and well designed in appearance. However there are two major issues worth noting. The reception is bad no matter what frequency selected on the radio being played on. The reception gets worse depending how you hold the device when connected to the player. In other words, when your hand is about to grab the device, there is a lot of static. When holding the device, reception appears slightly better.Even bigger of an issue is the fact that this is NOT compatible with any of the newer generations of the iPod touch. The technical details states compatible with touch but does not distinguish which version work.The seller promptly issued a refund because of the deceptive advertizing."
3,"It works, BUT....","1. It is impossible to use it in big cities (unless you have a co-pilot that can do the dirty job for you or be sure you are going to crash)2. Yes, the volume is really low3. Yes, 3 inches away from the stereo and all you get is static4. Yes, lots, lots and LOTS of static, unless you get a perfect magical place in your dial AT LEAST 1,5 positions away (both forward and backwards) from the next FM station5. Yes, it does eat your battery away (lasts avarage 4 hours when fully charged)6. When driving from one city to another, you will always need to reset the frequency for obvious reasons. Example: 3-hour drive from Aspen to Denver, I had to reset it 3 times while on the road.HOWEVER...It does play any song you want from your probably vast selection stored in your I-Pod and eliminates the need to listen to those very old songs on your CDs or the hassle to bring your heavy and bulky CD collection with you."
1,ONE STAR TOO MANY! HORRIBLE!!!!,"This is about the worse thing i've ever bought for an ipod accessory. It does NOT work. All I heard was static, and very little music. If you do want to hear music, you literally have to hold your ipod right next to the radio and stay perfectly still or all you'll get is static. I bought this online and received it and was so excited to use it. I was hesitant to buy it, seeing almost every review has said it doesn't work but I bought it anyway, don't buy it! Every review I've seen has negative feedback for this item, and I agree with everyone. I figured since Griffin made a new itrip, it would be better and work great. However, it is the total opposite from that. I do NOT recommend this product at all. Don't waste your time or money."
2,"OK, but it could be better... a lot better!","I bought the black iTrip with dock connector to match my black 5G iPod. It fits and looks great--very elegent and the small size means it's not hard to stow when putting the iPod away. I wish I could say function follows form, but I can't. The main reason one gets this thing is to listen to one's iPod on one's car (or other) FM radio. Hello! The poor thing does not live up to expectations. Not only does the transmitter have an extremely limited range--like a couple of feet, but it has an audible background ""hum"" (or is that a ""buzz""?) Anway, it's got background noise on top of frequent static and loss of signal. The folks at Griffin Technology have some great design people, but for the prices they charge, you'd think they would build a better product. Like my mother used to say, ""if you're going to do something, do it well."" (Guess they never met my mother!)"
1,Works Intermittantly and not with most cases,"Frequently (about 20% of the time), I have a very hard time getting the transmitter to start up. I have to turn the iPod on and off, unplug and replug the transmitter, etc... for about 5 to 20 minutes before it finally decides to turn on.Because it is so big, and it needs to fit snugly against the entire bottom of the iPod, it doesn't work with the vast majority of cases.The volume isn't very loud - not nearly as load as my old FM transmitter for the 4G iPod or the radio.And finally, I often hear a clicking sound when I am listening to a quiet song and the volume is turned up loudly.I strongly reccomend not purchasing this product, especially since it is fairly expensive."
1,Not impressed,I returned the item b/c it was terrible. Didn't work in the car and barely worked on the stereo.
3,Good.. but..,"The transmitter is of very good quality sound, but its not a very strong transmission.. noises can be heard so easily if you dont put the iPOD near the antenna of the car.."
4,Good value for cost. Disregard bad reviews!,"At first I was skeptical about all those one-star reviews, but the item is very inexpensive so I took the plunge. People who want it to work perfectly right out of the box might be disappointed if they don't know how to configure the product. Some points:- of course it is not CD-quality sound, or stereo-quality sound, or iPod-quality sound. The signal is being sent over FM airwaves, so it is FM-quality sound, and that is as good as any FM transmitter can provide.- if the signal has static, change the frequency. The default frequency does not have to be used. My reception was affected by my rear window defogger, for example. When the defogger was on, static broke in. But I changed the frequency by 0.2 and the problem went away. So anyone with the brains to operate the controls on this device should be able to get around the static.I love this iTrip and recommend it highly!"
2,blah,"After reading all of the reviews and ignoring them thinking everyone was just whining-the iTrip really is a poor product. It works sometimes but more often than not I'm wishing that I don't crash trying to make it work.I consider myself extremely patient, but dealing with the static is a bit much and thus I am returning it tomorrow. If you are looking to buy this product with the hopes of it being useful for long road trips and such, I'd advise against that because the frequencies change so often and theres too much interferenceThus- I'd suggest buying a tape deck adapter: they do get in the way, but it's the best sound for the money and they are much cheaper than this piece of junk"
2,ehhhh,"so i just bought an iPod 30GB video today...ya know, the knew ones. I figured since i dont have a tape deck, only a cd player in my car, i should get this. i bought it at best buy for 50 bucks. I loaded up my new iPod, got in my car...and was VERY disappointed. I'm a musician, so i can really notice poor sound quality when i hear it. As per the other reviews...the fact that the signal strength is TERRIBLE holds strong. no more than 6 inches from the source.static, static, more static...i may as well just stick to cd's when it comes to much in my car.My truthful advice...stay away. it was 50 dollars i should not have spent."
1,Terrible,"The worst piece of equipment it has ever been my misfortune to have bought.Signal strength = garbage. If it's more than 12 inches from the radio and/or not positioned DIRECTLY facing it the signal goes in and out (if you're lucky) but usually dies out completely.I'd also like to mention that it doesn't work well with ipod skins (the tight usually flexible rubber cases). It didn't work at all with the skin I use, and it's extremely thin.The LCD interface is very nice however.There isn't much more to say. This product blows, and it should never have made its way into production. Avoid at all costs.Try the Airplay, it tends to be cheaper, smaller, and works better."
3,"it's nice, but...","I have a lot of trouble getting a good signal through the car radio. Even after putting it on an empty station, I can't hear my music unless I position the iPod right next to the face. Anywhere else and I can't hear a thing. The position of my hand in the car affects the tunes too. For the price, I'd say not worth buying."
4,Itrip,"Works good the only time it get a little static is in the morning but for the most part it works good. It seems to work alot better when the mini U.S.B charger it not pluged in to it. Don't know if this will help anybody, but I have tired it in several differnt cars and trucks."
4,Great,"hey, listen this product is AWESOME!!, and well thers a little problem... you just have to change it alot... or well only if you go on trips.. but that is to be expected.. and you cant have anything blocking the signal.... but its a GREAT product!!, and for the PRICE?!!! ITS AWESOME!!!"
1,Not worth the price!!,"I had high expectations for this product, It was a total waste of money, you have to keep changing the radio station to get a clean signal, the sound is not even clear, to much static, I just bought a AUX cable for 8 dollars and connected it straight into my car stereo sounds just like a CD. If I would of known about that before I would have never bought the ITRIP."
3,works but not real well,"If I had paid the full store price I would be very disapointed.At the Amazon price, it is probably worth it. the unit seems to have very limited range. way less than 10 feet-- it does not work well in the car even when I move it up on the dash near the anntena.It seems to do ok if you place it right next to a radio. That can be useful since many small radios don't have an input for an Ipod"
4,itrip transmitter,"Product works great, after I figured out how to work it on my own. The item did not come as the picture had shown. It was not in any original packaging like it showed on-line. instead it came by itself in a gray plastic bag with no instructions or anything. good thing it was easy to figure out. price was great but i'm guessing that's because they aren't making this one anymore. But it does work wonderfully."
2,Worked for a while,"It worked great when I first got it...lasted about a week, and then stopped working. Since it stopped working while I was driving, I'm hoping I'll be able to get it to work again if I mess with it while I'm not driving. If it doesn't work again, I guess it's no big loss since it was only about $4."
4,Very good for the low price!,"Very usefull and cheap. There are only 2 problems: the frequency goes only until 88.3, and in my other itrip i used to put in 87,9 whitch is much better here, where i live; the other problem is that it doesn't have the ''thing'' tha make it better conected to the ipod (a little iron part on both side of the dock conector). Dispite that, is very usefull and for the price i recommend!"
1,Don't waste your precious money,It's better if you spend your money in something else. It has a ridiculous transmitting power. So bad that even radio transmitters from miles away interferes with this device 1 ft from the radio receiver. The audio quality is so bad that totally destroys the pleasure of listening to your music. In fact this device should be forbidden to be sold or should be tagged as phony advertise.
1,awful signal,I picked one of these up to use in my car and at work. I have to keep my ipod within 2 inches of the broadcasting radio to work. Also the dock conneter has a tendency to fall out sometimes. A co-worker of mine has an older version of the itrip that works much better than this version. So whatever upgrades they think they made I hope the fix them for the next version.
2,Dont bother.,"Bought this hoping it would be better then my other one but nope just as crappy. It didnt come with instructions or anything on how to turn the stupid thing on and it kept losing signal. If i were you,i would get a aux cord or if you have a tape player in your car,get the tape with the cords that come out of them to plug into your ipod,cd player,mp3 whatever. They work MUCH better and you wont lose signal."
1,"Nice concept, doesn't work.","I couldn't get it to work. In addition, in our locale there are too many FM stations and difficult to find an open unused spot on the dial."
1,Terrible,We have an older iPod with the older iTrip and it works great. I bought an iPod Video and purchased the new iTrip thinking it would work as well. Wrong. I agree with the other bad reviews--this barely worked at all and had to be returned. Avoid it.
2,Misleading,Everyone who is looking to buy a FM radio for their Ipod need to know that a transmitter (which this product is) only transmits when there is a FM radio close by and doesnot play FM radio by itself. It is useless if you want to use your Ipod as a radio and you dont have any other radio.
1,JUNK!,"Believe the opinions of most of the people who have made the mistake - like me - of buying this thing: It is pure junk! It has to be one of the worst hoaxes ever put over on consumers. It does not work, and you can forget getting any real help or service out of Griffin Technology."
2,"Works, but could be better","This is a well designed product but the transmitter is pretty weak. It would be nice if it would go down to the lowest station available, 87.5, where there usually isn't a station. It goes down to 88.1. Atlanta is not a good place to have this if you don't like static. It does the job and it's really great to be able to play music from my ipod to the car radio easily, but it could have been made to sound better."
1,Hey guys this is a rip off!!!,"I don't know what Griffin was thinking by putting this piece of garbage in the iPod market. Honestly, the signal is terrible... my grandpa's century ago radio sounds better than this piece of garbage. SAVE YOUR MONEY, TRY SOMETHING ELSE!!!"
2,waste of money,"A great idea but.... Signal is too weak, I have to hold it right in front of my radio to get a good signal. You'd be better off getting a tape deck and an adaptor for that, more volume and a better signal. Huge waste of money."
2,Griffin Tech iTrip Transmitter,"Good thing this product is cheap, because this product is not that great.Most of the time when you use it, you have to ""re-boot"" your ipod.Also, while it has a wide range of frequencies to choose from, it doesn't seem to be able to tune low enough on the dial to find a truly unused frequency."
1,iTrip doesn't work,"I read the manual twice before trying the device, and the device didn't work - the car radio either didn't pick up the signal, or there was no signal output. I went back and reread the manual and tried again and still there was nothing, and this time the iTrip did not even stay set on the output frequency I set it to - it kept resetting itself to the default frequency. I have to assume the device doesn't work so I have to give it a 1-star review."
4,Worth the price,"Well, I have to hold it close to the radio for it to work, and it's often static-y, and quiet, but it's certainly worth the low price I paid for it. Definitely not ideal, though."
1,do not buy,"this item didn't fit into my iPod and didn't work when i would flip the lever to get it to tune into a station. get something that ISN'T wireless. my sister has one that's really good. it plugs into the cigarette lighter and plugs into the iPod. then you click 'search' on it and it finds a radio station that's available for you to tune into to hear your music. get that one, if anything. (i'm not sure what brand it is but it's all black)."
2,Is not what I expected,It has poor signal (at most 10 inch from radio) and disconnects very easily. I do not recommend it.
4,Great product - not perfect for the car,"So far I'm thrilled with the iTrip. It's easy to use and works with my video iPod and my husband's iPhone. I use it with our home stereo, and the sound quality is great. The only small complaint I have is that it's not great for listening to podcasts (as opposed to music) in the car. I can't seem to get it loud enough to hear well over normal driving sounds. Music is fine, though, so it's a start. I'd recommend it to most people, as long as they aren't talk-junkies like me."
5,Great seller,"Got the iTrip I ordered in the condition I ordered and two days early! Great seller.Works as a great FM transmitter in my home, car, motor home and beach. Great for trips and parties with iTrip and my iPadTouch songs.The songs you want when you want them."
3,"Ok, but not great.","I had the previous version of the iTrip until I dropped the iPod and the iTrip broke. Not realizing there was yet another revision past this one, this is the version I got (called 2006 on the Griffin site, I believe). I'd recommend the new version. You can't use this with most cases that have any thickness around the bottom, because this one wants to be flush with the bottom of the iPod. They added space in the latest version. Also, because this one uses the dock, you can't hook up your charging cable with dock connector while it's in use. I had to buy a USB to USB mini-5 cable to charge it while the iTrip is in use (which i haven't tested yet). It seems to work as well as the previous version as far as providing a decent (though not great) signal, and it will be fine for my daily use. But it looks like the newest version has some improvements."
2,2 stars,Bad audio quality. Signal gets cut off if the transmitter is lest than 14 inches away from the radio and the bottom of the transmitter needs to face the radio at all the times.It's been nothing but a disappointment.
1,"Perfect form, failed function","I got this the same day I got a new 60GB Ipod. When trying to use it, as with other reviewers, I had an effective one foot range with _spotty_ reception. Though FM-quality was expected, static interfered with all tests. Any further than one foot had no reception at all.Whatmore, the hardware interface is poor. Through gentle handling, the iTrip continually lost power, resetting itself to the default channel. The lightest jostling of the iTrip caused it to fail and reset.Even with reasonable expectations of performance, this device underperformed. I returned the device soon after."
4,Sounds like a radio station,"i bought mine used on amazon.i like it a lot though.you just plug it in and the choose a station. (for me the higher the frequency the better)It basically sounds as clear as a regular radio station would sound.So, i'm pretty happy with my purchase. It's a good deal if you get one used for 5-10 bucks.sorry this is a crappy review."
4,ITrip works well in Chevy Aveo,"I had lots of suspicion when I read the reviews for this Itrip, but I decided to go ahead and give it a try in my car. Needless to say this works great for my car and my location. I drive a Chevy Aveo and live in the SF bay area. I tuned the Itrip to 87.9 and the reception is really clear with no hissing noise, absolutely none of the problems that I was reading from the reviews. My two cents go ahead and give it a try and if it doesn't work just return it, it's that easy."
2,meh,"rwk had some interesting advice (first page of reviews?) and i'd try it if i could find my itrip.like a lot of people, i had the older one for my 3g ipod which worked great but this one doesn't tune down to the magical station (87.9) and doesn't lock securely to the bottom of the ipod.for what it's worth, it seems to work better with a stereo in the house than in the car."
1,Really Disappointing,"OK, I should have read ALL the other reviews first but I had the itrip mini which was fine so bought this on the strength of that.. Big mistake, just couldnt agree more with everyone else. It falls out the bottom of the ipod, it stops transmitting if you handle it, and the sound quality is very poor. Oh, and I also couldnt get it to work unless I laid it down a couple of inches from the car stereo. I hate using it cos I love the ipod video 30gb that i have and this just makes that seem REALLY tacky."
2,Works but has low volume,"I paid $50 for the iTrip with the docking connector and using it with the 30GB iPod video. It works and the sound is clear but the volume is really low compared to CDs or even other stations. I've tried various stations from lower frequencies where there are no neighboring signals coming in to higher frequencies where it's harder to find something with nothing coming in on a neighboring frequency. All in all, I'm pretty disappointed in this for the 50 bucks - it's going back to the store today."
1,Weak Signal - Useless,"I have a new 30Gb Video ipod. I tried using the itrip with my home stereo, car stereo, and a clock radio. In each case I have to keep it within 1 foot or so of the antenna to eliminate static.Sound quality is mediocre at best. Very disappointed."
2,sort of works,When I plugged this cable in from my laptop to my mixer it came through extremely quiet and only through one channel. It's a stereo cable so that shouldn't be. I jiggled it around some and upon pulling it out of the jack just a little bit it then came through at the correct volume and through both channels. Problem then is that it's not plugged in all the way so if it gets tapped slightly it cuts out again. It's not a problem with my laptop input or the mixer seeing as other cables work just fine. Maybe I just got a dud cable.
5,Does it's job,"I used this cable to go from the 1/8"" headphone jack of an iPad to the 1/4"" in of a guitar amp with no problem. No shorts, no static, just like it's supposed to do."
3,PalmOne Zire,Not holding the charge. This is a replacement to one that also doesn't hold the charge. Probably will return.
4,Take me back - great research,"Great story line .. wonderful use of research. I am greatful for the time and effort Jeal Auel took with writing this volume. It stands the test of time ... any age would enjoy this one. Easier to read than the original, Clan of the Cave Bear."
1,The End of Blackness,"Of course this would be The End of Blackness for someone who as the author has married out of the Black race; however, I tried to get pass that part and see what was mentally there and discovered there's nothing to grow or learn from because the book doesn't look at the real society and how the real society views people of color in today's real problems. We can portray ourselves differently all we want but in the end we will still be seen as the same... a spade will still be considered a spade."
2,You mean a Harvard grad wrote this illiterate book?,"Miseducated lunacy in print. The author needs a good English teacher and a shrink before she publishes another book. To see how well she managed her own personal life, read her previous semi-fictional autobiography. Another unemployed degree-holder looking for attention and profits."
1,The Horrific Consequences of Child Abuse,"I had the discomfort of interviewing Ms. Dickerson for two hours after ATTEMPTING to get through her book. I couldn't get through it sequentially and was forced to pick it up, randomly read a section until I couldn't stomache it any more. What a waste of a higher education. I think that the widespread incidence of child abuse can show up much later in life and leave us with adults with extensively damaged psyche. I alternatively feel sorry for this damaged little girl in a woman's body and outraged that she would lease her blackness to those who would publish a peice of ethnic slander like ""The End of Blackness."" I regard Ms. Dickerson to be somewhat schizophrenic...but I doubt that it is her fault. This is a classic case of both ""post-enslavement traumatic syndrome"" and the ""Stockholm syndrome."""
1,Just another hustle,"Debra Dickerson's latest polemic is just more of same: kick the victim, promote self, extol the virtues of ""bootstrap mobility"", promote self, pander to conservatives by making them comfortable with their prejudices, promote self, make the PR rounds with a ""brave"" pseudo-provocative message, promote self, collect money. Ms. Dickerson did not live in a vacuum; she did not get to the Harvard Law School entirely on her own, as she seems to believe. More than anything, her message reflects either a brazen dishonesty or a transcendent ignorance of the historic, economic, political and social forces that shaped this country and the destiny of black Americans. This is a book that could have been written by Dinesh D'Souza, Shelby Steele, Thomas Sowell, or any one of a dozen other race hustlers. It is a foolish waste of trees."
1,"Intellectual dishonesty from a very confused, troubled mind","Read Professor Gerald Early's recent review in The New York Times Book Section, and his summary dismissal of this shallow and self-referential book: ""One does not loosely string together a series of disparate, barbershop-type anecdotes and attempt to call it a book. One simply gets over it."" Amen.I have seen Debra Dickerson on various talk shows promoting this nonsense, where she has been proven utterly incapable of defending every ""thesis"" she posits when challenged. Let's get this book to the remainder tables, where it rightly belongs. Let's hope that Ms. Dickerson uses some of her advance money to get into much-needed therapy. And let's hope the author understands that when she hurls stones, that huge glass house in which she lives - her personal life - becomes fair game for public disparagement - ESPECIALLY when viewed through the prism of her foolish, intellectually dishonest pronouncements."
1,Here we go again,"Do we really need another black neo-conservative to tell us how hypocritical black America is? The only reason a book like this gets attention is because certain segments of white america enjoy hearing these neo-conservatives denigrate or ""critique"" other blacks. Such critiques are always embraced as fresh and insightful but it is the same opportunistic nonsense that certain blacks for decades have used to advance themselves at the expense of their own people. Save your money and time."
1,Turned away,"I thought fate had led me to buy this book because within one weekend's time I had stumbled on three televised interviews with the author. My feelings seemed to be in-line with hers so I went to the local bookstore and thumbed through the pages.It seems the book was written for a very narrow audience; I could hardly keep up with it. Finishing a sentence left me breathless (not amazed, but actually gasping for air). Forget about anyone with less than a doctorate degree reading and gaining anything from this book. The author has succeeded in turning me away."
4,To the Point,"This is one of many voices saying much of what needs to be said. Ms Dickerson makes good valid points about how we as a nation have been hoodwinked to beleive that we cannot get along better, how we seem to hurt when we try and help. The biggest point I think she made and she only touched the surface, is the fact that many in the present generation are not speaking up and telling those malcontents that they need to go home (J.J. and A.S, you can hear me, but then we don't expect you to read too much, sort of hard to read when you are chasing ambulances) how we spend too much time blaming and complaining rather than getting out and doing. How it is equated that being learned, intelligent, polite and outgoing are white traits. They are not the author reminds us, just like all of this athletic nonsense are black traits. There is only one America and one Africa, we need to do well here in order that they will do well there."
5,Very Intelligent Work,"It is so good to see this very intelligent person tackle this complex topic. I have tried to: William A. James, Sr., ""The Skin Color Syndrome Among African-Americans,"" 2003. It is where we must start before we will be able--as a whole people--to really set ouselves Free! in Black America. We must free our minds first. We have to do that one-by-one across the boards. This book should be required reading in schools across America. My hat is off to this Writer. Sister, I hope you can come lecture at the University of Virginia sometime in the near furure. I would love to meet you, or be in the audience if you were to come."
5,Its a good book,To some of you black people who reviewed her book I would like to know how you are a sell out just because you marry a white man. Have you people been listening too much to that fascist Louis Farrakhan? Hitler said that Germans can only marry Germans some of you people sound a lot like him.The book was really good but I also recommend William Wilson books for a deeper analyse of the problems of black America.
2,Superfluously Thick,"Having read previous works on notions of blackness in America from historical figures W.E.B. DuBois, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglas, sociologist William Julius Wilson, and activist Angela Y. Davis, I started from a perspective that Dickerson's work would be at the level of these noted authors. After getting through the introduction, however, I realized my mistake. The work is not a scholarly compilation of syllogistic conclusions. Rather, it is a work that Ms. Dickerson can confidently claim as her own. Assumptions are based upon false premises that lead readers to conclusive arguments derived from erroneous logic. The thickness in verbage that includes slangy tone is rather demeaning as one sloughs over Ms. Dickerson's opinions that come off first as xenocentric but later are diffused."
3,"Interesting, But a bit confusing","Overall, this was a good page turner and the information is quite interesting, but I left the book feeling kind of confused.In part one of the book, there is a devastating critique of current White racism. This clearly provess that she beleives that racism is still a major problem. (We cannot deny that it is).The problem is that in the second half, she notices the pathological reaction of Blacks to this (which mostly rings true, although the section on Uncle Toms stretches things a bit ) and all but tells people to ""get over it."" Easier said than done. The ""Ghetto jokes "" at the end of the book are ones I've seen on e-mail myself, and the section on low Black self-esteem is on solid ground.But it seems to me that what she said in Part #1` would make it clear to anyone why the behaviors in part 2 exist."
1,Why Legitimize Stereotypes by Publishing Email Jokes?,"I really wanted to like this book. The author's previous tome was inspiring because she refused to be put in the box that society had prescribed for her. I liked the fact that she went from a dull bank job to the military to Harvard Law School. However, her current book is a disappointment.My main criticism is that she legitimizes stereotypes by publishing email jokes. The fact that these jokes are now in book form gives them a legitimacy that they never would have had when merely passed around as email jokes."
1,This is a terrible item!,"I echo the other reviewers comments. The lid does not stay on at all, I put that in the closet a long time ago. The potty leaks every single time my daughter uses the potty. I think it leaks down between the seat and bowl and then pools in the bottom or leaks onto the floor. The seat is difficult to remove to clean. The flush mechanism held no interest to her and just ended up being something to mess with. I bought 2 of these chairs, one for my house and one for grandma's. They both leak. We are just about finished training, otherwise, I would spend the money on a different potty chair. Also, the bowl does come out easily and now my 2 year old tries to pull it out and empty it herself, leading to even more mess."
2,Okay...,"It's okay if your kid needs somewhere to pee or poop. I do like the fact that it has his picture on it (which attracts him to it), but I don't like the fact that a) as the others say, the pee leaks through the bowl (I have NO IDEA how this is possible); b) the ""recording"" is so scratchy it scares him every time he flushes; c) you have to remove the flush mechanism each time he pees because of the pee in the bottom of the bowl. However, he does using the chamber pot as a hat, and the rest of it as a step stool..."
2,Not impressed,"Do not waste your $$$ on buying a potty with all the bells and whistles. The flush sound, picture holder, and voice recording are soooo not necessary. We don't even use those features. Actually we don't use much of this potty. The only thing we use is the seat ring, we take it off and put it on the big potty to use. It was such a hassle to clean! Oh wait...we also use this potty for it's step stool ability. As a step stool it gets 5 stars!Now, I have a boy...this seat was definitely not designed by anyone who has a boy or who has tried to potty train a boy. The lack of a pee guard is so impractical! There should be a warning to parents of boys on the box!Bottom line...not happy with this product."
1,I have to agree with....,all the other parents of boys. This product does not suit little boys very well. I have had to dismantle and clean this potty almost everyday. Even when my son gets everything inside it seems as if a little seeps through the bottom of the removeable cup to the inside. I will have to get him a potty with the old fashioned little cup to go in front of him
1,"Messy, messy, messy","After my 2.5 year old uses this, there is pee not only inside the potty, but under the ring, inside the potty under the holder, and ON THE FLOOR of my bathroom. It's just a mess and extremely TIME-CONSUMING cleaning up ALL of the parts, AND the floor after each use."
2,leaks alot,"I bought this potty chair because it seemed simple. however, every time my daughter uses it it leaks on the floor and under the bowl, so theres always alot of clean up. the flushing handle falls off all the time and is hard for my daughter to use. wished i'd spent a little more and got quality instead i got crap!"
1,"Messy, messy, messy!!","I think this potty would be okay for girls, but not for boys. When boys use it, the pee goes under the rim, between the removeable pot, and spills out on the floor. I have to take it apart and wash it every time. I tried the detachable seat on the big potty, but my toddler feels insecure because it slides around. Now I'm going to have to buy another potty because he insists on using the ""little potty."" I'll probably buy a one piece from baby bjorn."
1,NOT FOR BOYS,I got this for my 20 month old son. When he tries to use it he ends up peeing on the floor. What they call a pee shield doesn't shield! I thought it would be great seeings he like to flush the toilet. Works great for girls though.
4,Works well.,So far product works as described though I have just started using it. Looking forward to using it much more.
5,Porky's I & II,Seller was prompt in making sure item purchased was received in a fair amount of time. Am tickled with my purchase :)
4,Porky's,Good to find a combination which reduces the total number of DVDs in my collection! I appreciated the service and enjoyed the movies.
4,Save $10,"You can save $10 on this item by going directly to the creator, http://www.codejunkies.com. You won't find recent games like Mario Kart Double Dash or 1080 Avalanche; you have to buy the upgrade for $9.99 or manually enter the codes listed on their website. Other than that, it is really fun to get to play with all of the things we hadn't unlocked before!!!"
1,Not informed that you CANNOT add codes,"I was never informed or was not able to find something on the box that said that I was not allowed to enter my own codes. All the other versions allowed me to enter new games and codes to use, well they COMPLETELY REMOVED it from this version. Most of the games on here arnt even worth playing or you could just look up cheats off the internet for them. Very missinformed."
2,Don't waste your time with this!,"They sure love to rip off people. You can't even add cheats to this thing. I quickly sold this one, and got the older action replay, and that is hard to find. The first cheat device where you can't add your own cheats? Are you serious?. I though Gameshark 5 (for the PS2) was bad since it was so restrictive and slow, but this is 2x worse. I even contacted Datel to tell them how disappointed I was with this, and they ignored my e-mail which is no surprise. I was constructive, but they don't care. Datel is not very good with these products IMO."
1,IT WAS BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It was broken when I got it the disk wouldnt read. I am going to have to send it in to the company.
2,,"This isn't a game, it was a disk for cheats for my son. I thought it was a memory card and got a disk instead. It wasn't what I wanted but the package came when it was supposed to and arrived in good condition."
1,This is a good bad item.,IF YOU SUBMIT MORE THAN FIVE CODES IT COULD BREAK YOUR VIDEOGAME SYSTEM! This product is only useful if you want to break your game system! I rate this a 1!:~Very Bad~
1,Action replay,"After my first hour of using it, it started pulling up error messages saying that the disk was dirty and to please turn off the system. The memory may be huge but it gets corrupted really fast. I would sugest getting a bigger memory card and playing the game the way it was meant to be played. WITH OUT CHEATS!!"
2,Action Replay (GCN),"There's good news and bad news about this kind of action replay. The good news is that it's already loaded with decent codes for almost every game, but the bad news is that it doesn't contain a memory card and you're unable to add in new codes and update it. So for those who likes to type in new codes for their games, I advise you to look for ""Action Replay MAX""."
3,ok device,I no longer have it because I no longer have a gamecube but when I did it was ok but not as good as I was expecting
3,Action Replay info,"I like how this action replay was cheap and affordable for me, but it had a major flaw that i wish i knew before. there is another disc similar to this and it is called action replay max. I wanted that on because in that disc you can put in codes and expand your gaming experience. The one i got you cant add codes and that pissed me off. i didnt know that this different disc doesnt allow you to put codes in. I wish there was a description of the contents in the disc of what it is capable of doing so i dont make the same mistake ever again. Anyone who is looking for the gamecube action replay with code adding capabilities then make sure you get the Action Replay Max, not the one that is compatable with the wii. One last thing, there are some good things in this disc its just that you cant add more to it. so I am not saying dont buy it, im saying be careful of which one you buy."
1,Read before you buy!,"I bought this AR assuming it, like every AR I've ever heard about, could be used to add codes and make a game more enjoyable. However, this disc comes pre-loaded with all the codes it will ever have and you CANNOT add more codes to it. Most of the codes on here are very vanilla and don't do anything particularly special outside of ""infinite health."" I use an AR to do things I otherwise couldn't do, and I just don't see that being possible with this one. Most codes on here seem to just be for people who want to make a game really easy. If that's what you're going for, go for it. If you're looking for something to enhance a game experience, you'll just have to pay the ridiculous price the original ARs cost."
3,Why does Datel do this to people??,I recently bought a new version of the Action Replay for the Nintendo Gamecube I believe it is version 1.20 and I found out that you can not add new codes to the disc or anything. I am stuck with the old codes and no way to put new codes on there for my new fave game Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.. so if you are reading this than beware that you can not update it and Datel will not warn you..
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"This thing is bad. It only worked for a week,then it started freezing my gamecube.Then some of the cheats would not work.And worst of all, it deleted all my memory data on my memory cards. It also messed up one of my favorite games.I suggest to all, NEVER BUY THIS ITEM!"
4,Good but then again bad,"it is a great thing to use,but the bad thing is I had it for about a month and the disk snapped in half on me so it is a good thing to buy if your really carful I plan on buying it againg!"
5,Action Replay is the best!,AR is the best game enhancer in the Cheat Systems(R).Gameshark: 36%Codebreaker: 29%Datel Design/Action Replay: 59&Action Replay is the #1 cheater and will help get further to your gaming future.
1,Will not work on new gamecube.,If you own a new gamecube don't buy this product it will not work.You need to buy the one in the silver and purple box because itis Version 1.14 and will work just fine.The other one is Version1.08 and will not work with the new gamecube.
1,Lousy customer service,"I have attempted to order an Action Replay for Gamecube directly from Datel. As of Sept 2 they said they were in stock and would ship the next working day. As of Oct 3 I still don't have it, nor does Datel say when or if I will get it. They had no problem with taking my money. I cancelled my order and requested a refund. They said they would refund my money within 7 days. I will see if I get my money.If you must bue one do not order it from Datel.I don't know how the current version works, I can't seem to get one."
2,Cannot enter codes,"Yeah, when I ordered this I thought that you can put codes on it, but yeah apparently you can't. Or at least on the version I bought which was for gamecube and wii. So If you want to do that try finding a copy of the old one cause now I have to go get the old version for an extra 50 bucks, if I can even find it. So check it out before you buy it cause now I'm screwed."
1,not item pictured,item received was not the one pictured. The item i got was a new DATEL which can not be programmed with custom codes.
1,It is fun only when the code is pre-loaded and the device does not crash,"I would agree with most of the reviews here. It is fun when it works. It is extremely painful to enter a new code. The on-screen keyboard is ill-designed. I think they just want to sell their keyboard to you. When you type something wrong, you may end up to re-type the entire multi-line codes again. It is easy to spend one hour to enter the codes for one game. Furthermore, it is not reliable. It crashes often and all the codes you entered for hours are lost forever. And sometimes the machine cannot start with the dongle inserted. My friend told me that it may erase saved game when it is in malfunction. I do not know if this is true. The reliability of the device is very low. Be aware that you cannot create your own code. If they do not publish the codes for certain games or for certain cheats, bad luck."
3,action replay disc only version,"wish i could add codes, metroid prime codes good, metroid prime 2 codes lacking boo on intec/action replay, this version was easier to find than the older better one which they should have still been making"
3,"Why there needs to be an ""Add Cheats"" feature again.","Even though there are many cheats available in the disc already, there could be new codes/fixes from the site that couldn't be added in the future. There are also many codes that make games more fun and they are not in the disc (ex. Using Giga Bowser or Master Hand in SSBM). Some of the cheats don't even work (ex. The Mario Kart Double Dash ""Press Z to Jump"" code doesn't work at all). It would be better for Datel to add the ""Add Cheats"" feature again so that gamers actually get what their looking for."
1,Gamecube action replay,"Let me start off by saying, DO NOT buy this product if you hope to add your own codes. This version of the gamecube action replay cannot be updated with codes. I, like many others bought this product under the impression that it was much more than a disk preloaded with some mediocre codes. DO NOT purchase."
1,BEWARE!,"My son bought this product because the picture showed the 1X memory card and the product description listed it as well. The manufacturer no longer makes the AR with 1X memory card. At least one of the sellers, Sup Media, will ship the AR WITHOUT 1X memory card when you purchase this item. I have no experience with any of the other sellers so I do not know what their policy is. Just BEWARE if you purchase this item it is NOT the Action Replay with 1X memory card."
1,Houseplants for Dummies,My rating would be higher had I got the book. I traced the book and it says it was delivered but I never got the book.
3,not what i was looking for,i was hoping this book would provide the information I need to care for my houseplants. unfortunately it didn't include the plants that I have so frankly its not much use to me. i think they spent a lot of effort providing a little information on a vast array of plants but would have been better suited to focus on the most popular plants and provide more detailed information.
1,Terrible,"I am bony and floor pilates is extremely uncomfortable without an adequately padded mat, which I thought I was buying here. The vendor, Mobile Edge, waited almost 2 weeks to let me know that the item I had ordered from them was out of stock and that they were not expecting replenishment. C'mon people, this is the 21st century. Computers make inventory management a breeze compared to the old way of physical stock counts.At least they promptly reversed the charge to my credit card.By the way, I later ordered the mat from the manufacturer. Its not that great either. The surface gets slippery from hand and feet sweat (gross but can't be helped, especially with Bikram yoga), and the padding wasn't thick enough to get me through a pilates class. I have to use this mat plus a sticky mat layered on top for yoga, and this mat with a foam mat on top for pilates. For the expense and inconvenience, I should have just bought two or three regular mats at the local sporting goods store."
5,Great Days,"Excellent !!! Lost my John Prine albums long ago, its so great to have the music back again."
4,Great Days is GREAT,This Anthology is wonderful. I have enjoyed hours of listening. It shipped very promptly and arrived in great condition.
5,A master's work!,"John Prine is one of the smartest and most insightful songwriters around, and this is anthology is certainly the best introduction to his work you could hope to find.""Great Days"" is a thorough and exhaustive compilation of Prine's recordings from the earliest album to his most recent albums. The quality of Prine's songwriting, both in depth and breadth, shows here. Even on first listen, most songs will feel like old friends.This compilation is a must-hear for the novice Prine listener or for the veteran (the liner notes alone are worth the price of admission)."
5,THE MACINTOSH OF SONG WRITERS,"John Prine's songs first got my attention way back in 1971 when I first heard ""Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore"" on KSAN-FM radio in San Francisco. I had to buy the record. Since then, John has written and performed many clever, humorous, insightful, and heart-wrenching songs that are every bit as good as ""Your Flag Decal ..."" This anthology displays most of the best of these songs. As most John Prine devotees will understand, it is frustrating that more people haven't seen in Prine's music the special talent that we have seen. Oh well, sometimes it takes special people to recognize unique talent.This anthology is getting dated now that John has released ""The Missing Years,"" ""Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings,"" and ""In Spite of Ourselves."" Still, a must buy for Prine fans, especially if you prefer his early stuff."
5,Something to Say,"A truly enjoyable listening experience. John Prine has been derisively called the poor man's Bob Dylan, and that's a shame. He has a style all his own; wry observations on every-day life.Hello in There is a definite highlight. Very touching ode to America's elderly.One of the best compilations discs around."
3,not so much,I got introduced to JP with his Fair and Square cd. Brilliant! So I read the reviews on this one and went for it. I like some of the songs but not as much as I anticipated. It is hard to listen to much because the mix is awful. His vocals are buried so deep in the music to the point of being hard to hear. The live cuts work the best. Must of had a different engineer.
5,Prine's Amazing History Revealed!!!,"John Prine may be the most underrated songwriter ever. There are only two others that I can think of that are close. (Just For The Record John Denver and believe it or not Alice Cooper). Prine has such a sense of dark humor and the abilty to tell a story whether believable or exaggerated. This collection contains some of his best from each album he had done to date. What is great is that even the greatest Prine fans debate what his best songs are. For example,I think Pink Cadillac's songs are the best of his career but many feel it is his worst album of material. Anyway, you need to check this out and join the debate. Also,if you like Bonnie Raitt check out Angel From Montgomery, a duet she did with Prine. For those unfamilar with Prine, this is a wonderful compliation to check out. If you are a rock fan,country, or folk you'll get something from this masterpiece. Hello In There!!!!"
3,The ego behind racism.,"George Lincoln Rockwell's book is probably one of the most influential works from the Radical Right's early stages. Without pulling any punches or offering any apologies, Rockwell expresses his openly racist and anti-Semitic opinions, complete with (very) carefully selected, and biased, research to support his views. Rockwell also gives himself away as a man with a highly inflated ego, making this book an insight to the mind of the man who is often credited with the birth of the Neo-Nazi movement. While much of the material in this book is quite dated, anyone who read Rockwell's interview with Alex Haley for PLAYBOY magazine will find this book worthwhile."
2,not what i expected,The picture makes this costume look much cuter than it is. If your child has any hair the yarn wig won't cover it and the shirt and pants are made out of really cheap looking fabric which doesn't have the texture or look of fabric you would expect for a native american costume.
4,Cute,"I got this as a gift. Anyway, it's a cute little purse. It's decent quality for the price and I love the pink lining. I haven't had any problems with the zipper catching. I have two small complaints about it. One, the strap is a little short. I can actually get it over my shoulder in lighter coats but it's a little too short for fitting around a heavy coat sleeve. My only other complaint is minor and that's that the little bow comes undone and once it's undone it's nearly impossible to tie it back the way it was. Overall, I am pleased with the bag. It's a nice stylish bag for the price. I am looking forward to seeing what kind of purses they will be making for spring and summer since I'll be able to shop at a stateside Target this summer."
1,Poorly Made,"I bought this bag and then returned it. It looks great and the pink lining is such a good idea beacuse you could actually see what's inside. However the zipper gets stuck on the lining. Talk about stressing out when you car keys are inside and you can't get your purse open. I would not buy it, unless you don't like to zip your purse closed. Wait until they fix the design."
5,Such a cute little bag!,"I ordered this bag and the little boots and love them both! This is the first time I have bought clothes (or accessories) at Target, but it will not be the last! I can't get over what great quality the Isaac Mizrahi Target collection is at such an amazingly low price!"
2,Made My Food Smell Bad,"After using this ladle in hot soup, my food smelled like chemicals. It was fine for cold food though. Not keeping this."
3,fun for as long as it will last,My son was thrilled to get theses from Santa this year. I am afraid the plastic they used won't hold up for long though. It's pretty flimsy. my son will have to bring them in the house every time he uses them because here in our Arizona heat the sun will have them in pieces in no time. the sand also has to be pretty wet to work. Overall they're fun but won't last long term.
3,price of smelling good,"This product suddenly increased in price by fifty per cent.Why is that,is it worth it.I do not think so,I have bought this when it was 50$,but in six month it went up to almost 80 $"
4,F15 Review: Challenging but Fun,"I share a great interest in planes. I bought this because it was my first model plane I have ever built. It was very difficult to build for a first timer. Although there are alot of pieces and glueing them was dificult. I found making the plane a fun experience. Overall, a worthy purchase for plane builders but a difficult task for first time builders."
4,Very small parts!,"I have to agree, the quality of this toy is very good, but having never built a model plane before, I didn't know the parts would be so small. I bought this for my 11 year old grandson figuring we could build it together. Some of the pieces are smaller than a caraway seed and others are so thin we couldn't get break them apart from the grid without destroying them. If you are not good at model building, I would recommend something a little bigger."
1,"Do Not Recomend, Poor Fabrication","Many of the parts for this model do not align and quality of plastic fabrication is poor. In addition, some of the parts are so ridiculously small that you can only handle them with small tweezers. I'm not sure why they didn't just fabricate the smallest pieces into the main body of the larger model components. I bought this model for my son and the experience was that of sheer frustration, not fun. I'm returning this model plane to Michael's for a full refund"
3,A little too eclectic,"Well, the entire Blues Masters series is a ""sampler"" actually.Anyway, this untitled volume draws from almost every kind of blues and blues-related music, from the ancient recording of a Texas prison camp work gang's rendition of ""Go Down Old Hannah"" to Stevie Ray Vaughan's funky 80s blues-rocker ""Pride And Joy"".It's rather too ecletic, actually...Count Basie is squeezed in between Stevie Ray Vaughan and blues shouter Big Joe Turner, gentle old songster John Hurt is here with his classic 1928 single ""Candy Man"", and Howlin' Wolf, Elmore James, John Lee Hooker, Sonny Boy Williamson, and B.B. King are missing.The music is good, sure, but this strange collection doesn't really do the Blues Masters series (or blues music in general) justice."
4,Insightful.,"I have friends and family that are bi-polar and I felt a book like this brought me into more awareness and information regarding bi-polar.I'm sure anyone who can relate will find anything that is helpful to bring them into a better of idea of such diseases as this one. And the fact is, people, who are in fact bi-polar are just regular people. With certain medications (as needed/or if needed), theraputic solutions, and being aware of this disease you have; your on your way to a healthier and better you.I appreciated what the book had to offer."
3,"Some advice, a lot of self promotion, and too many absolutes","Some of the advice in this book on how to cope with a newly diagnosed bipolar family member, and the mood and behavioral shifts that the disorder can cause, is helpful.Too much of the book is a self-promotion for the author's own business.And there are several absolutes in the book that can set a married couple straight on the road to divorce, and don't take into account the broad spectrum of relationships and that not all bipolars are completely spun out-of-control. One such is the advice to get all finances, titles, deeds, credit cards, checking accounts, etc, out of the bipolars hands and name.I'm the bipolar in my family. I handle the finances. I pay the bills. And I don't go out and buy 17 pink cadillacs as this woman gives as her example of a bipolar on a spending spree. If my husband tried to pull this stunt, I guarantee we'd be in divorce court and the mortgage wouldn't get paid on time. He can't even organize our taxes."
3,Not great but not horrible,"As others have said, overall the book was ok but I did not like how the authors would say 'bipolars, your bipolar person, etc.' I am a person with bipolar disorder, not 'A' bipolar. It just kinda ticked me off how she took the fact away that we are still people who happen to suffer from this horrible disorder. And they promoted their own business in every chapter which was annoying. Just my bipolar 2 cents."
5,Great Space-saving product!,"My daughter loves this chair. We got it for her when she was 5 months old and just learning to sit up, now she is 11 months. It adjusts to a growing child and is easy to clean, we just wash the removable trays with the dishes. The wipe clean surface is easy to clean and disinfect. THe height is also adjustable.It's also very sturdy and folds away if you need to put it away. We live in a small apartment, so another piece of furniture would have been a hindrance, we just placed this seat on one of our dining room chairs. It's perfect!"
2,Uncomfortable seat,I purchased this chair after reading all of the great reviews about it. We wanted a chair for our 6 month old that would sit in our existing dining chairs and not take up any extra room.I was so disappointed when I got this chair. It's very uncomfortable for our baby because its entirely made out of plastic and the back does not have padding. Yes its easy to clean but our baby was fussy as soon as we put him in it.We returned this and got a fisher price space saver chair instead. We are thrilled with the space saver. It's so comfortable and alot larger than this chair. The tray is bigger and he loves to sit in it at the dining table with us.I would pass on this chair and if you are looking for a chair for home get the spacesaver if you are looking for a travel chair get a hook on chair.
3,The tray insert comes out!,"I like this seat just fine but my 13 month old son can pull out the inner white tray and dump his dinner in his lap! I don't use it because of this, what a waste."
4,Nice booster seat...,"It was a little smaller than I had expected, and I realized that I, a clean-a-holic, was going to have a tough time with all the straps on this chair. The baby I watch keeps reaching down and grabbing them with her messy hands.. :) Other than that, I think it works very nicely and the plastic parts on it are pretty easy to clean."
5,Great for the Grandparents House,"When I bought this booster seat, I also bought one for my parents' house. They were all set to waste money on a highchair...until they saw this seat! It takes up no extra room, since it attaches right to a regular kitchen/dining room chair. Cleaning is a snap...just wipe it clean; there's no cushion or fabric to get stained. It folds easily and compactly, which makes it perfect for my parents to throw in a closet until the next time we visit. We take ours to restaurants all the time, instead of using a restaurant seat that hundreds of other kids have used. I love the carrying strap and can tell my son will be using this for years to come."
5,We love it!,We bought this booster seat when my daughter turned 1 and we love it. It's very practical and portable. It's also easy to clean. I wish I would've bought this earlier instead of the big bulky highchair we got.
4,beware of tray,"This is a great highchair just beware that the white and green covers that fit over the blue tray are popped off easily, my 11 month old had them off within seconds of putting her in the highchair for hte first time. The highchair works great, it is adjustable to fit shorter chairs and is very easy to clean. We don't even use the white tray and green cover, though it would be convenient for traveling."
5,The best chair ever for going out!,"We use this at home and every time we go out to eat. It is fantastic and it holds up well. I can't say enough about this product. It is easy to clean and the try can go in the dishwasher. We have two of them, one stays in the car and the other one is in the house. We ditched our big high chair for this one."
4,Excellent alternative to high chair,"I bought this for my 8-month-old baby to use at her Grandparents' house. It's been a great alternative to buying a spare highchair. It works well with the tray as a high chair, without the tray to sit up at the table and also on the floor.I love the removable tray for clean up and it all packs away so neatly for between visits."
3,Happy with product but not so much with condition of product,"Am happy overall with the product but was very disappointed to find that on the white tray (the one my baby would be eating off of) that there is a large section right in the middle that looks totally scratched... like someone took an abrasive scouring pad and washed/scratched it. Maybe the product was used by someone but then returned? I wish the returns department had inspected the item more carefully so that I wouldn't have to pay full price for a ""used"" (not ""like new"") item. I don't feel like it is worth the cost and effort of sending the product back for a new one, oh well."
5,I LOVE IT!!!,"As a mom of 4, this is by far the BEST booster highchair!!!! As I start my daycare, I'll be purchasing a few of these to have on hand. It grows with the kids to suit their needs.... and yours!"
5,great seat!,"I bought this for my son when I realized he could get the tray off of his high chair. This tray is secure and adjustable, plus there is the great ""extra"" one. I do wish it could sit a little higher, though there are three levels of height. Not especially gender neutral, but if I end up having a daughter at some point I would still use this seat. Also, I love that it folds up!"
4,Great booster seat with a few drawbacks,I really love this booster seat but I was excited about the 2 trays and cover which turned out to be a bust. My son quickly learned how to pop off the insert tray and wouldn't leave it alone during meal times. So the cover and tray sit in a closet taking up space. Maybe when he's older it will be more useful but for a 6 mos to 1 yr old the tray is overated. The rest of the seat and regular tray are great and easy to clean.
4,Good quality and price,"Needed a temporary solution for toddler without a high chair. This booster fit the bill. It is sturdy and the straps keep the booster very secure on the chair. The main tray snaps in securely but there is a removable second tray. The idea is to be able to take off easily to wash but it is also easily removed by toddler when food is on it. If the 2nd tray was more secure, I would give 5 stars but still a good purchase and would recommend."
4,Good Seat,"The trays fit a little too tightly for our daughter and her little belly, but as a booster that gets her high enough to eat at the table without needing a full-blown high chair, it works just great."
5,Love this product!,"I love this product so much that I have purchased 3 of them! One stays in the trunk of my car for outings and restaurants that dont have high chairs (surprisingly I came across one the other day), and travel. The other two went to two grandparents homes! We travel to see them a couple times a year, it was easier to purchase this product and leave it there. Its a product that was price friendly and will last long while it starts as a high chair and moves to just a booster seat. I would recommend this product to anyone! The chair easily holds my son and the straps fit him fine, and it folds up to an easier carrier seat. We ended up not using the tray that goes with it very often, so we tossed that, but we absolutely love the seat! The chair even went to the babysitters house when our son was staying there for dinner. Love it! My son is an average to thick sized 1 year old and it fits him great, but very chunky babies might have a problem."
4,Much better than the one I had,"This little seat is great. It fits nicely into the kitchen chair and he seems comfortable in it. I only have two complaints, the tray is easily removed and contents flipped out by the baby, and he turns and sticks his arm throught the hole in the back and gets his arm stuck. Otherwise, it is the best chair of the three that I have had."
5,"Love it...Very stable,easy to use and carry","This is a perfect booster seat...It saves so much space and plus you can carry it with you anywhere you go.I took it to my in laws place and it's perfect for long drives too...the lid on the top tray keeps it clean.All in all,a great booster seat for a great price.."
2,plastic nuisance,"The booster seat is minimally adjustable; fits on a level chair seat; held by adjustable straps. Child is secured by a three-belt harness, plus the removable tray. However, the tray is secured by a three-position plastic lock that depends upon the flexibility of the plastic material for removal. Tray removal, which is performed every time a child is taken out of the seat, can be easy or quite difficult, depending on the accuracy of manufacture and the temperature of the plastic tray. This can be a very annoying operation with an impatient child."
4,great booster seat,"great booster for young eaters, small contour seat, no sliding . the tray is a bit difficult to attach & detach."
4,"Great value, super space saver","My baby girl loves to eat in this chair, she feels like an adult because we use one of the chairs in which we eat. The only feature this seat does not have is that it doesnt recline, so little babies that can not seat well by their own, tend to move forward."
4,Healthy Care Deluxe Seat,"Great chair. Easy to use. My 2 and 4 year olds love it. Easy to clean. I throw it in the tub and soak it when the seat and straps need to be cleaned. Another great feature is the fact that you can change the level of the seat so your child fits well under the table without the tray, if you prefer."
5,Absolutely the BEST!!,"The best booster out there hands down!! adjustable, compact, easy to transport (or not), sturdy, removable tray and sanitary cover....I've had one over 6 years that I purchased when my oldest was a baby, and used again and again for my 5yo son, and my 3yo son. It has held up amazingly well. So when our twins started eating solids, it was a no-brainer...we got another one. This could easily replace a high chair. Get the one with the removable trays, you won't be disappointed."
2,Product ok,"Product looks great, but my 9mos old grandson can pull the tray off by himself. The seat is very sturdy and straps down securely, but the tray, insert & cover were made improperly or should have been better thought out."
4,perfect,"exactly what I needed! I don't have space for a full size high chair, this works, plus I can take it with me when we visit family"
4,Good seat,"I was given a full-size high chair as a shower gift. It was so large and bulky that I dreaded pulling it out of the corner and setting it up, and cleaning it afterwards. So I bought this seat. It works very well. Only took about a minute to get a perfect fit on our dining room chair. I love that it is super easy to clean and is very compact.There are 2 reasons I didn't give this 5 stars, but I still love the seat.#1. The lift-off tray is useless. It doesn't snap all the way around the main tray, so my son flips it (and any food on it) on the floor within seconds. So we only use the main tray that actually hooks to the seat.#2. I wish the tray would swivel instead of snapping completly on and off."
4,I made the right choice!,"After exploring the internet for booster seats I decided on the Healthy Care by Fisher-Price. My 16 month old had decided that she didn't like her highchair any longer and I was skeptical that I was going to find ANY chair that she would like. Her grandma had bought the On the Go Fold Up and she wouldn't even sit in it. She seems to love being a ""big girl"" in her FP one. I love that it comes with a cover for the tray as we have two dogs and all highchair trays seem to attract dog hair (static). It really attaches snuggly to our chairs and is easy to clean. The only thing that I am disappointed in is the size of the tray-it is a bit small. Overall though I am very happy with this chair."
4,Great booster!,"My mom bought me this booster for my 18 month old son. He's 31"" and 31 lbs. and he fits in the booster comfortably with the tray on. Other booster did not fit his belly, but he has a couple inches to spare. Like the healthy care high chair, he whips off the tray insert, but no big deal. The seat is super easy to clean, too. Don't hesitate."
3,I have this and the original healthy care highchair,"I bought this while traveling on vacation. We have the original healthy-care chair and love it, so we thought this would definetely be good for us. Well....it travels well. I'll give it that much. BUT the tray comes off WAY too easy. My, then, 8 month old would have that tray off in a matter of minutes! Not the actual tray, but the healthy-care tray. The whole reason we bought the thing. So, I would suggest not for you not to buy this product, but for fisher price to find a more creative way to keep that healthycare tray in place."
5,You will wonder why you bought a highchair,I bought this when we moved to our new apartment because I didn't want to trip over a huge high chair. My daughter loves this seat and can't wait to sit in it for her meals. It comes with 2 trays so when one snap out tray is being washed you can use the main tray for feeding. It also comes with a cover so that the trays don't get dusty or gross when not in use. The seat also has 3 height settings so that you can adjust it to get baby closer to the table so s/he can eat off the table. The seat back also folds for compact storage. It is also very lightweight and you can move it while holding baby too. This chair is VERY easy to attach to the chair and when both straps are tightened the seat stays very snug. There is no need for non slip rubber feet with how tight the straps stay. This chair is a best bet for small spaces or when baby gets too big for a high chair.
2,A Little Disappointed,"I went out and bought this booster seat for my 21 month old daughter. My 3 year old son has a booster seat as well which is a cheaper model (still being sold), and other than being a crumb trap which has to be taken apart to be cleaned it is very useful, it gets him up high so he can sit at the table with us and it allows me to strap him in so he can not get out during meal time. However this Healthy Care Booster Seat is almost worthless. It does not elevate my daughter up high enough to eat at the table (her height is in the 90%), so I have to use the tray. But unfortunately the tray is so small, I can not fit any of my daughters child size plastic plates on it, so I have to put her food on the tray provided, which she can take apart and throw. This chair is easier to clean, but not giving me anything I need."
5,WONDERFUL seat!,"We got this to stay at grandma & grandpa's house so that we wouldn't have to worry about carting something back and forth... it is the best seat ever! We used it with our first son starting when he was about 6 months old. He liked being able to sit at the table with us. We've since used it for our second son, who even now, at age 2.5 still uses it as a booster chair (and THANK GOODNESS it has the 3 point harness, as sometimes he needs it!).A GREAT investment."
3,Fisher Price Booster Seat,"We have two Grandchildren under the age of 2 why we purchased the booster. (we already had a high chair) This works fine, but would not want to use this daily. Felt safe only the tray does not come off easy like our high chair. Great for the price and what we are using it for. Like a standard high chair better. What is nice this packs up easy and in storage waiting for my Grandchildren's arrival again."
4,Nice but expensive,"It is a nice seat, but after i bought it, I got another one from another store in about $10 less!!"
5,Exactly what I needed,"I struggled over the decision to get this for a long time. All the highchairs are expensive and bulky. Finally, I chose this over a highchair because I live in an apartment and do not have a lot of space and because it's so inexpensive. It is easy to assemble and very comfortable for my child. I thought he would grow out of it quickly, but that has not been the case. It's portable, though I have not used it anywhere but home; however that is a great option of overnight or weekend trips. It's easy to clean and not a pain to strap him in. Also, my biggest fear was that he'd fall over in it, since he likes to rock and lean over, but it's very sturdy. My only regret it not getting it sooner. I recommend you get this as soon as the baby can sit up."
5,Unbreakable!!!,"My kids can break anything and this thing is still standing. Not only is it standing, it's in good shape!! The baby swing collapsed, the play pen caved in and the baby push toy was broke to smithereens. They stood on it. They popped the back of the seat out. They rode it. They threw it and it never broke. Durable to say the least. It has been through two toddlers and is on it's third. I haven't seen anything stand up to my boys like this one. Two of my sisters have one each also and they love them too. I recommend this to everyone. It's convenient also, I can travel with it just about anywhere. Fisher Price, this is a keeper!"
4,Fisher price healthy care booster seat,I would say its a good value for money. I bought it from babies r us for $16.98 and I used a 15% off coupon and it came down to about 14 something and I think its a good value. I however see that online its selling for about $25 so I guess its a better idea to go and get it from babies r us. I think its convenient but I am still not sure if it can substitute a high chair. My daughter is only 5 months so for now its quite good but lets see maybe in the near future I will be needing a high chair.
5,"Booster Seat,... easy to remove and put away",I like the compact size and that it can easily be removed and put away when I need the extra chair. Its easy to clean and can use the trays or be pushed under my table. I've used hi-chairs at friend's homes but they are too bulky for my small kitchen. This chair works just as well!
5,love this seat!,"I bought this for my son because he will be starting on foods in a month. I wanted a high chair that is a space saver style as well as easy to clean. This seat seems to be just what I wanted! My son has been sitting in it about once a day to get used to sitting with us at the table and he appears to enjoy it. He is 5 months old and a little small for the seat, but that is good as I hope to use it for quite a while. Also, cute colors!"
5,Awesome !!!,This is great for a grandparents house and to take to a restaurant. It is such a nice product and easy to assemble. The price is very reasonable as well. I'm glad I got this product.
4,Some re-assembly required...,"purchased 5 for our church and we like the features. one problem was that 3 of them had the straps assembled incorrectly - attached to the wrong place or threaded through the buckle incorrectly so it was difficult to adjust. Fortunately we had one that was correct that was our model to figure out the ""right way"" so that the straps could be used easily."
4,Perfect replacement for a high chair,"I absolutely love this booster seat! It fits securely to my kitchen chair, it is very easy to remove the tray in order to place the child in the seat, and the plastic makes clean up a breeze. It folds into a traveling seat which worked wonderfully when we were moving. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is very VERY easy to remove the white and clear tray. The problem is my son will take them off of the booster seat and play with them (stand on them, throw them around, whatever comes to mind). From this, I can definitely say they are indestructible (by the hands of a toddler) but I wish he couldn't remove it so easily."
5,"Great! Easy to install, clean, and pack.","Great product. Very well designed. Easy to pack, carry, and set up. Plus it actually looks nice (we got the dark red one). I think our child is secure and it adjusts to many different table heights."
4,Dishwasher safe tray is TOO easy to remove.,"My daughter owns two of these seats -- one for home and the other for travel -- and I bought one for my home.Having raised my two girls with Fisher-Price, the company has been high on my list of wonderful. The only negative I had about any of their products was their McDonald's play/town/set (it was a hand-me-down from a friend). I couldn't imagine why anyone would buy a toy that advertises/promotes fast food. Other than that, I never would have envisioned a negative thought related to any of their products.At 7 months my granddaughter figured out how to remove the dishwasher safe, removable feeding tray from her F-P Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat -- and is wildly excited and happy when she is given the opportunity to again experience the thrill of detachment. So, at this point, that feature of the product is useless.I would highly recommend these seats, but you may want to keep a roll of painting or duct tape close at hand!"
4,Good value,"Got this for our new very active 17 month old Granddaughter. Found it well packaged, and easy to set up and adjust. Excellent value for the money. Would recommend."
5,Love this!!,"We bought two of these Booster seats for our twins and both kids and me are in love with them. They were shipped by Amazon and arrived promptly ( a day ahead of schedule) using standard super saver shipping. Installing took two minutes and our kids love it. They are sturdy, tray tops are dish washer safe and seats attaches fairly firmly to the chair. Very easy to move around and occupy a small corner of our living room ( very inconspicouous). We are keeping the chairs in the lowest position for now as my daughter sometimes can rock back and forth with quite some force."
5,Gift for a friend that really enjoys it,Bought this for a friend a she really enjoys it. Recommend especially for grand parents that don't need a full size high chair.
5,Great!,"I used to have one of those cheap Safety 1st booster's and I have to say it was the biggest waste of money. But with the Healthy care seat everything is perfect. The straps are long enough so that my son is comfortable and securely seated, the booster fits snug and firmly ontop of the kitchen chair, and best of all my son seems to enjoy sitting in this booster."
5,A great booster seat,"This is a wonderful booster seat. Our son has been using it since he was 5 months old, and it has been great. I especially like how it helps him sit up, even when he was not doing so on his own. He is a big boy, and the seat fits him comfortably. It is really easy to take into restaurants or anywhere else you might need it. Our son outgrew his bouncer and swing by the time he was 4 months, so this seat is a life saver. I highly recommend it!"
3,To small for my baby,"My baby just turned a year old and is big for his age, 26 lbs, 32 in. I brought this gift out of storage just the other day and he looked too tight and uncomfortable in it! The chair looks likes a really nice chair and sturdy too. But I took it back because he didn't look comfy in it."
5,Gotta Have It!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just recently bought this for my 17-month old daughter who wanted to be Ms. Independent. We have a high chair at home but was wanting to feed herself at relatives and it was hard to when they don't have a highchair so, we went out and bought this awesome booster. The best thing we could have done. She absolutley loves it!!!!"
5,Best Booster available,"We love this seat, It is compact enough to take to restaurants or anywhere you may need it. Our daughter just loves sitting in it. The tray is really nice and the cover is a great option. I would definately reccommend this seat."
3,Tray is too hard to remove,"This booster is basic and meets our needs nearly perfectly. It's easily cleaned, can be taken anywhere with ease, doesn't take up extra room in the dining room, and is very affordable.Yet every time one of us struggles to remove the beige tray from the seat when our baby's done eating, I wonder how this chair gets such consistently high reviews. So far, my husband, my mom, and I have fought with it to get the tray off--so it's not just my technique. It snaps on easily enough, but getting it off is too difficult. Does anyone else have this problem? I'm wondering if it's a design flaw or just a problem with our seat."
3,Baby Shower Gift,Gave this as a baby shower gift. The honoree loved it and she seemed happy. I gave it three stars because I have no idea how well it works. Seems like a good concept though. The gift seemed nice.
1,expensive,"why did it went up too high, it was $27 last week, almost doubled the price. i have seen the rating,that is why i was goin to buy it. i hope it will go back to the old price."
1,convience,"We bought this chair for our granddaughter to use at our home. It stores away easily, easy to clean and does not take up room like a high chair. The adjustable height makes this chair perfect."
2,Backrest unstable,"I read all the reviews on this seat and thought I would check it out. The very first time my 3 year old used it she pushed her back against the backrest and it popped out of place causing the plastic to stretch un-naturally. This happened several times within a 2 week period. I actually bought 2 of these for my two daughters. The second booster had the same problem. I need a booster seat that will last for a long time. If you have kids who like to push back or stretch out in their booster seat I would recommend a booster seat with a thicker backrest. Also the attachable tray with cup holder is so easy to remove that my 3 year old removes it while she is eating, thus causing her food to fall on the floor, making a very big mess."
2,Too small for a toddler,"I purchased this for my almost 2 year old granddaughter's visit, and immediately sent it back. The tray was too small even for her child size plate, and the item overall was undersized -- maybe good for a child much much younger. Would not recommend."
2,looks are deceiving,"I had bought this for my son at 6 months old for visiting graqndparents. I really liked the features, but didn't like it once i put my son in it. I loved the idea that it folded up, had a carrying strap, could come apart easily to clean, and the different trays. I thought that the back could be a little higher, he still needed some support, and couldn't sit straight up. Also he is an average size baby, and when i put him in the seat he had just fit, and the seat looked really small with him in it. I returned and bought him a reclining seat with a higher back."
5,Great little seat,"So far this seat has been great. Super easy to install, use and clean. We could definitely use this instead of our high chair. But right now we mostly bring it to restaurants and other's houses. It's almost easier to bring this chair and pop it in at the restaurant than to drag a high chair over and try to clean off the nasty stuff from it! this way he gets a tray as well instead of eating off the table and trying to reach our plates. It's great!"
5,It's perfect,All my friends had one and the reviews for this booster seat were rated the best. So I had to try it myself. I love it. It is so easy to clean and use. It is highly recommended. I use this instead of a high chair. I have no extra room for a high chair.
5,Take it everywhere!,"We do not own a regular high chair. We use this at home, but also take it whenever we go out to eat--the restaurant folks are always impressed! I don't like to put my child's food on the regular table at a restaurant--this contains his mess much better and makes our dining experience a bit more enjoyable! The other great feature is that it is super easy to clean--no little nooks and crannies to mess with, just wipe and go! There is no need for an expensive fancy high chair unless you just like throwing your money around!"
5,Great even for wiggly babies!,"I bought this booster because my son had outgrown his bouncy chair, where I used to feed him, and because we didn't have much space for a bulky high chair. He likes to squirm so I was a little apprehensive about its safety and whether or not it would stay attached to the chair or deposit my child on the floor. However, the straps adjusted nicely to my dining room chair and it remains secure even through his worse 'wiggle fits'. I love this booster and I don't think I'll ever buy a highchair for him or any other children!"
3,How do you get your baby in and out of this seat?,"I got this seat last week, and it seems to be good quality. However, I have only put my baby in it twice, and he goes in no problem, but getting him back out has been horrible! He screams a cries because his belly is scrapping the feeding tray on his way out, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to remove the feeding tray to get him out? The tray is on there really tight and I'm not sure undoing it every time is a good idea. Can anyone share how they get their baby out of this thing?"
5,Love it,"Fits perfectly in our dining room chair, lovely color ( I got the green & blue). Baby loves it. Easy to clean and store. Great for traveling parents. Does not take up extra space in the house. A winner!"
5,Inspect on Arrival,"The first seat I received came with a molding defect. This made it impossible to snap the seatback into place. I returned it right away, and within two days received a new seat that was in perfect condition. The whole return process couldn't have been smoother or faster. This could have been a very annoying experience, instead it was no problem at all. Thanks for the great service"
5,great buy,"I love this seat. It's really convenient and easy to use. You can use it either on a chair or on the floor, whichever you and your baby like. I didn't buy a bulky high chair and think I did the right thing. This seat will do the same job at a lower price."
4,Great Seat,"I really don't have any complaints about this booster. We bought it for my son because he was a bit small for his age and wasn't sitting very well in restaurant high chairs. He sat much better in this booster, and at 2 years old can still use it. It is sturdy, lightweight, and easy to use."
5,First and Last Booster Seat,"I love love love this product. I may be biased because this is my first booster seat purchase, but up until now, I've been using a regular high chair that was a hand-me-down. This booster seat is SO easy to use and manipulate; I didn't even need to read the manual to figure out how everything worked! I love how everything adjusts and grows with my baby, including the strap, back, tray, and height. I even store the cover under the seat because it fits under there perfectly."
3,"Great seat, but low...","Unlike the newer version of this seat, this one does not have a height control. So it's great for bigger kids... but if you have a little one, like me, you will have to stick to the tray that comes with the seat, your baby will not be able to seat at the table. But otherwise , great product."
2,Regretting my choice,"I bought this chair because it is small and fits on my small dining room chairs. I have a small New York apartment so it works well for that. The problem is that it is a very small chair. My 5&1/2 month old is going to outgrow it fast, probably in the next two months. He is big, 23lbs and 29inches long, but this chair is suppose to be good for toddlers to. His little chubby thighs aren't going to fit soon, so I would not recommend this for a long term chair for your baby.Also, the tray is very difficult to put on, when you are doing it while tiny grabbing fingers are in the way, it takes a a long time and you must be very careful.I would not recommend this chair, if you have a big baby, keep looking!"
5,Love it,My mom first bought this chair to use at her house when my son first started eating solids. After using it there I knew I needed one. It is great to take anywhere. It folds easily and is lightweight. My son is now 22 mon. and uses the chair at the table as a booster. He also pulls it in the living room to sit in while watching Seseme Street!
5,Easy to use and clean,"Ordered for my 1yr old. This is easy to use, clean and tote. I am very please with my purchase."
4,Eijah and his booster seat,"My baby loves his litle chair. when it's time for food, he climbs into it and wait patiently. It's secure and sturdy, a well built chair. I'll recommend it to other viewers."
5,"Don't think, JUST BUY IT!!!! It's AWESOME","My 6 month old baby would'nt sit in one position, if on the chair, she will try to turn. It was a major prob for me to feed her anythin bcoz of no stable position in any of the things i used to place her on. I went by the revies of this booster and bought it. It's simply great, it has become my live saver as I can place her on this chair and forget about her safety. She is nicely buckled up, has things to play with on her tray...so now i can take a breather and do my chores.I got the red n white seat as itwas for just $23 also something diff. I love the colour too. Best part is that U can take it around, where ever u want...Earlier, we were considering a high chair, but this is soo much better. I prefer this to a high chair. I can sit comfortably and feed her. We also place her booster seat on our chairs and take it outside. She enjoys it.I love it.I love it..and I simply love it.Go for it...."
5,So far so good!,I love how much smaller this seat is than our high chair. I also love that it's so easy to clean as there are no little cracks and crevices like my high chair. I just wipe it down and it's ready to go. Definitely recommend!
5,Grandma G,I do not personally use this product. My daughter loves it. They don't have a very big apartment so not having to have a whole separate place for a high chair is nice. My grandson is only 7 months old so the edge around it makes it easier for him to get a grip on things. From what my daughter says I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high chair.
5,Perfect for my baby girl whos 10 months,"I bought this a little over a month ago and I love it. I can use it everywhere. My daughter started using it at 9 months and still uses it today. Perfect for the beach, park the front yard, especially if your little one isnt walking yet. I put a few items on the tray for my little one to keep busy and she loves it. Its easy to assemble and quick to take apart. Perfect for traveling or just to use at home. Take it to the park and serve food on the tray. Keep your baby in sight with this booster seat. I got the red color which I feel is more easy on the eye and compliments most color decors. I highly recommend this product for all you mommies and daddies out there."
5,LOVE IT!!!!! :),This thing is AMAZING!!!!!!! I bought this instead of a high chair. And we are soooo happy we did!! We love it and I would recommend it to ANYONE who needs a booster/high chair for their baby!!! Save your money and buy one of these!!! :)
4,Works great! Except tray is hard to snap,"Love this high chair!Pros:- Love the 3 layer tray. The lid can cover the tray for easy storage of uneaten food. It also has a drink holder. It makes it easier for serving as well, since all I have to do is put over the main tray.- Great price (half the price of other booster high chairs)- Looks great in the chair and not out of place like a lot of high chairs. I love that it's nice neutral colors and not super bright kid colors. I mean, it does sit in my kitchen, not the play room after all.Cons:- not good for babies who can't sit up well on there own (not a problem for my 7 month old).- It's kind of hard to snap the tray on and off. Not a big deal, but just a slight hassle some times."
3,Not for two and up,I was looking for a booster seat because the high chair just got in the way. I put my two year old in the booster seat and she is almost to big for it. The tray is so small she just knocks food off of it. She looks like a giant in this seat and she is no giant. This is more for children two and under in my opinion.
5,Nice Booster seat,I brought the booster seat for my granddaughter who was five months at the time. I couldn't use it for her because she wasn't sitting up at the time and kept falling over so my three year old grand son was using it until she started sitting up. I like the fact that it's ajustable and both children can use it. I also like that I can fold and store it away easily since the kids are not there all the time. The seat is very sturdy and fits in my dinning room chair and is now being used by my granddaughter who is six months old and sitting up. Great little seat.
5,Great little seat.,Bought this seat for my 18 month old. It came ridiculously fast. Very versatile product. My daughter loves being able to sit at the table like a big kid.
4,It is good,It is convenient for carrying.Extra tray could help keep clean.The price and quality is good.My son loves it.
4,Great for traveling - wish the tray weren't so easy for toddler to remove,"This seat is great. We've started using it as our primary seat when feeding our 16-month old son.However, we've stopped using the insert (white) tray because he's figured out that he can remove it, which can make quite a mess. I wish the white tray clipped on the front or both sides to make it harder for him to remove. Oh well. Otherwise a great product."
5,Excellent! I bought two,"I love this chair - bought one for myself to use when grandchildren come to dinner. My daughter raved about it so much, I bought one for her to use when traveling. Practical, well made and easy to use."
4,Good booster seat,"I got this chair for my 18 months old son after he showed a lot of interest in sitting at the dinner table. I like that the seat is easily portable and has an adjustment height. I'm a little baffled about what to do with the trays because they seem redundant. The reason I want to use a booster is so that he can eat at the table, not out of a tray. Regardless, my son likes the trays sometimes and he prefers the booster over the high chair. Mostly because I think he likes to be part of the table and eat like adults. Unlike high chairs though, food often ends up in his lap when you don't use the tray because there's still a gap between him and the table. Overall I think this is a great booster and could even be an alternative to high chairs if you want to save space in your dining area."
5,Wonderful!,Thank you Fisher-Price.Good: 1. I can just wipe anything spilled off! (and it comes off without any scrubbing)2. 2 trays just in case one's dirty!3. Straps wonderfully to my chairs!4. Turns into a normal booster seat5. Can adjust to different hights6. perfect size for travel (although mine stay home)7. Cheap price!8. They can get in them by themselvesI love it! Thank you.
4,Great Booster,"I read a number of reviews for high chairs before purchasing my daughter. What I go was that no one liked any of them. I have nice high bar stools and merely attached this booster to one of them. It puts my daughter at the perfect height. I like the fact that the white insert tray comes off to wash. I usually use it with the white tray and without, both parts go on the top rack of my dishwasher perfectly.The only issue I have with it, is the tray. My daughter is not to mischievious when it comes to eating, but a couple of times she has been able to pull off the tray. And sometimes when I go to pull of the tray it pops a little. I have spilled some food that way. But other than that I have no issues. I also do not think there is another chair that has answered those issues."
5,"""CAN I ADD MORE STARS?!?""","Let's make this short and sweet...The Fisher Price Healthy Care Booster Seat is the BEST OUT THERE TODAY. Ours goes with us everywhere and we never have to worry about having a SPARKLING CLEAN, GERM-FREE ENVIRONMENT for our child to SIT and PLAY or EAT wherever we go. We've never found a restaurant chair it didn't adapt to and it's so easy to use. Buy one for yourself or make someone else very happy by giving it as a gift. We've bought 4 so far, as gifts for friends, and they can't stop thanking us.AND It's DISHWASHER SAFE, Parents!I hope this helped!"
4,Great product-Parents be really careful.,"The product is great and does the job it is advertised to do really well. I just want to share an accident our family had while using this product so it can maybe spare another family our heartache. My 2-year old son had just finished dinner, and I took him out of the booster seat. He was in the dining room, and I brought the dinner dishes into the kitchen. I then head a loud bang and a large scream. I ran into the dining room and my son was on the floor in front of his booster seat with blood pouring out of his mouth. He had tried to climb back into his booster seat and the foldable back seat had folded down and he fell. The only reason I mention this is not to blame the product as I should have been watching my son, and the product is not intended to be used in this manner, but to warn other moms to be really careful, because my poor son suffered from my inattentiveness around this product."
3,"Good, but not great for bigger kids.","I admit this is a good seat. It's cute, easy to clean, comes already assembled, etc. However, my 10 month old is almost too big for it already. He's big for his age but at 25 pounds, I can already tell that this seat will only work for a few more months for him. The tray is at the last notch and his legs and tummy don't have a lot of room to grow. Since it's made to last up to 45 pounds, I think this is a bummer. I am taking it back today because I know that we will want to use a booster for at least another year/ year and a half. This one just won't do it."
5,A Gear-head's dream!,"This has been one of our best purchases for baby gear! We love having things that make life easier and this chair has come in handy so many times. It straps on securely to ANY chair, even a folding chair, and even better, we used it camping when there was no chair at all! It gave our son a place to sit still (a rarity in our lives) and eat cleanly. It's light weight, easy to use, clean, store, carry and put together. I can't count how many people have asked us where we got it!"
5,Great little booster!,Bought this for my son to use when we go out to eat. I absolutely love it! Easy to clean. Folds up easily. Light weight. A must have!
5,FisherPrice is AMAZING !!!,"HOORAY for FISHERPRICE they have done it yet again,they made yet another excellent product for babies and toddlers.I will use nothing but there products.They have AMAZING and friendly customer service reps.This chair is the best and stays in my car for outings and planning to buy another for my husbands car.BUY THIS SEAT and save yourself the headache which you WILL encounter with the others."
5,Excellent as a substitute high chair!,We use this when at my parents house and it works wonderfully. It's excellent as a booster or as a high chair!!
4,Great chair for the price,"This chair is great for the price. It is very portable and we used it in several fast food restaurants on the spur of the moment when traveling for Christmas. The small size is both a pro and a con as my not terribly large one year old like to grab the tray and shake the whole seat. She also figured out how to pull off the tray cover quickly as others described. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons."
4,Some Minor Issues But It Works!,Our booster seat's white tray has light streaks of red coloring on it. The white tray doesn't fasten onto the blue tray very tightly but aside from those two issues it works as it is suppose to. We mainly leave it in the car for going out and having a tray cover is a good way to keep the tray clean.
3,So much going for this booster seat ...,"I bought this booster seat to complement the exact same one I bought a few years earlier for my first child. There are so many things I like about it. I like the removable trays, the portability, the way it folds up for carrying, the straps to secure it to a chair, the built in seatbelt, and the height adjustability, all for a reasonable price. However, when I received this one, for some reason, there was no hole in the carrying handle on the back of the chair unlike the other one I own. This made it much more difficult to carry. That was the only disappointment."
5,Fits all chairs and table heights,Our son LOVES it! It's great to have him at the table with us. At first I was sad because I thought I was going to have to stack books so he could reach table height but I noticed there are adjustable heights on the bottom and once raised he fits perfectly! I wish we would have gotten this from the beginning rather than a high chair
5,Paid for itself time and time again,"This is one of the baby products that i have used the most. Several times we have went into restaurants, peoples houses, wedding receptions and there has not been a high chair. I just keep this in my car and no problem. I even took it to the lake! Awesome product!!"
5,Love it!,"Very compact for our little apartment, yet has everything you really need for a high chair/ booster chair. No cloth to wash, no crevasses for food to hide in--Really, it was everything we were hoping for. Easy to use, comes fully assembled. We just put a dish towel down underneath it as a drop-cloth and we're good to go. Love that it fits easily in the dishwasher."
5,"Perfect, easy to use, easy to clean. Safe","I have an older model, but I have used it for over 7 years already!But believe me these come in so handy! I have used mine attached to a picnic table, attached to a park bench, on a beach chair, and I even attached it to a golf cart many times! It is small enough to go anywhere, and believe me it comes in so handy while staying at a hotel, at the beach, at grandmoms, or anywhere baby needs to go. It safely attaches to every chair we've come into contact with. And as noted above we've attached it to things the manufacturer surely wouldn't reccomend, so a watchful parent is a must! But it always was secure, straps are adjustable and easy to use."
5,Best booster seat,"We carry this booster seat everywhere. Is easy to use and to clean.I don't even use the tray, is much easier just to carry the seat.All my friends have this product and they all love it. Highly recommended!"
5,Great at Grandmas,"We have 2 twin boys who are 20 months old. They used to use an old wooden highchair at grandmas, but there was only one and it was falling apart. She bought these because they could work for my niece (3 years old) without the back and it could work with my 20 month olds as a highcahir. This chair is so convinent. The snap in tray is great, just like my Aquarium chair at home! It is also nice that it adjusts to the tray can rest on the table. I love that its VERY easy to fold and carry. My boys love sitting in it, and its SUPER easy to clean. We would buy one for restaurants, but we just use a floppy seat, less room and we need ALL the room with twins. I love this booster and its perfect for grandmas, houses with limited space, for going out to eat, or just instead of a highchair if you have multiple children! We love this chair, and would never use another one for grandmas."
5,Great booster seat,"A relative had this booster seat while we were visiting and we absolutely loved it! We liked it so much that we purchased one to take with us on trips. It is easy to install, easy to use, is lightweight, rather inexpensive and fits in most chairs. I would highly recommend it!"
4,smart design,simple and smart. easy to get baby in and out. easy to clean. hard seat and back may not be comfortable for long periods. folds easily for travel. would give it 4.5 stars.
3,"Nice seat, tray latches from HELL","OK, this is a perfectly adequate highchair that fits a bunch needs (easy to clean, compact, don't need to disappear a kitchen chair to fit it at the table).BUTand this is a BIG BUT:The click-in-place latch tabs that keep the base tray on are oftentimes VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO pull back to remove the tray. Especially if there is slimy kid food everywhere. I gather this must be a hit and miss fabrication problem due to the paucity of people pointing out this problem. But if you run into this issue it will be a big problem and pain in the booty."
5,Easy to Use & Clean--Great Product,"This is a fabulous booster seat. I own a few of them and keep buying more. It is easy to clean, sturdy, and very durable. It is a fabulous booster seat, even without the tray, so it can be used for years for one kid and shared among multiple children. It is lightweight, easy to transport, and the tray can be washed in a dishwasher. I cannot say enough good things about the product."
2,Wanted to love it but no match for a flip book loving baby,"I was so excited about this high chair. I loved the snap out 'plate' as a full tray is bulky to wash. After a week of using it full time, my 9-month old discovered that the tray snaps out like her flip/peek-a-boo books. She pulled it back and sent all of her food trying. We'll continue to use it, but without the tray. The other downside is that the back strap is not long enough to go around our wide dining room chairs. Other than those two items, it works just fine."
4,Mostly good,"Really like this product - very convenient and easy-to-use. Great for going out to eat. My only complaint is that my almost one-year-old can remove the food tray herself. It doesn't attach firmly enough, so we just end up using the bottom tray itself."
4,Great seat after a highchair,My son really needed to be transitioned to a seat were he can sit properly at a table ( with out kneeling in the chair) This seat is great. I am sure I will use the tray when we travel but we are trying to get away from the tray thing all together. My son is 19 mo old and he did great in the fp space saver high chair till this point. I am not sure why people are commenting on this booster not tilting properly -- I didn't think it was designed for an infant to start feeding. We should have got it a few months ago when he started climbing on his own into the highchair. Straps securely to out wooden kitchen chairs. easy to wipe down or vacuum out. :)
5,Love this booster!,"We have gotten lots of use out of our Fisher Price booster seat. We purchased this about 3 years ago and used it every day for our son. We now use it for our daughter. The adjustable height makes it fit any table, or you can use the very convenient dishwasher safe tray. I love how easy it is to strap onto any chair - the adjustable velcro straps make it a snap. The seat is also easy to wipe clean.The booster folds nicely to make it easily transportable. We take this with us on vacation a few times a year to make meal-time more enjoyable for everyone. It doesn't take up much room once folded and the velcro strap makes for a nice carry handle when your hands are full with all the other kidstuff that gets lugged on vacation.Definitely recommend as an every-day seat or as a travel seat to take to grandma's, etc."
5,On our second one... That's good!,"Well we bought one of these about 8 months ago and LOVED IT! We decided to take it over to the grand parents and there it stayed! lol We've bought another one for our home because we liked it so much. We don't even use the strap to hold him in unless the front tray is removed. Our son is pretty laid back though and not much of a squirmer. lolOne word of warning... The off white removable tray WILL stain with red sauces like spaghetti sauce, so I recommend removing it and using the brown main tray if that's an issue for you. It will stain the brown as well, but it's not as noticeable. Both will become more and more faint over time if you don't reintroduce more red sauces. Honestly, it's not an issue to worry about IMO.Well made, safe and looks good!"
5,Great seat!,"This seat is great. My son is 8 months and I take this everywhere-restaurants, visiting friends and relatives. He loves it. Its lightweight for me and folds easily. Also cleans very well."
5,LOVE THIS,"We live in an apartment, so we don't have room for a normal size high chair, so we got this and use it everyday, 3 times a day for my 8 month old. Plus it's great cause when we travel we just unstrap it from the chair, fold it up, and take it with us... which is SUPER easy!! The ONLY thing I would change is the dishwasher safe tray (the white one) would have a better lock on to the tray beneath it cause my son has figured out how to take it off while eating, which is really annoying. Other than that it's amazing and I recommend it."
5,Booster Seats,"We are grandparents to 4 (so far) with 3 age 1 and under. I have actually purchased two of these booster seats and love them. They are so easy to set up, take down, travel with, etc. When they are set up they are extremely safe (at least we have never had a problem). We would highly recommend this product as a booster seat."
5,I love this!,"This booster seat/high chair is great! It is compact, easy to put together and folds up for storage. The only thing that was a bit difficult is snapping the tray off the chair. I still would highly recomend the booster seat/high chair."
5,Great seat!,This booster seat is great! We like it so much that we've never even used the high chair we received for my daughter (now 7 months). We use it at home and take it when we travel.
4,Booster Seat,"I bought this seat for a friend and they have absolutely loved it! It goes everywhere and is highly adaptable to restaurant seats, various kitchen chairs as well as tailgating (chair-in-a-bag). It folds up nicely and is not a space hog. Being dishwasher safe has also been a plus I'm told!"
3,needs improvement,Hard to keep food out of area where belt goes into chair. Also not quite wide enough for kids who squirm.
5,clean and portable feeding - great booster seat !,"I will agree with the other reviews that this seat is easy to clean, portable, and safe to use... it is great that you can put the tray insert right into the dish washer, it folds quickly and easily and is lightweight, which all parents will appreciate, so that you can take it to a restruant. there are no places for food to get stuck.the only slight issue I have with the chair is that my son (now 2 years old, but this started at 18 mos.) removes the tray insert himself and flings any remaining food across the room when he is finished eating... I would have liked to see the insert snap in more securely...overall, a great product that I would recommend to anyone."
5,Love It!,"Awesome because....A. Easy to clean!B. Super portable!C. Easy to store if you are having people over and want it out of the way! Unlike normal high chairs that would take up a whole closet.D. Sooo inexspensive. I was looking at $300 heirloom high chairs so the wood finish would match our breakfast room table but I worried about scratching, denting, breaking, etc. etc. etc. It would have been lovely but my 14 month old like most others I assume, can be quite destructive. If she breaks this one who cares, it was only $25. I could buy ten of these and still not have reached the price of the other. Plus with the plastic being so durable I can hand this over to friends in the future."
5,Love this Booster Chair!,I love this booster chair. I bought it to take on vacation with us and it worked perfectly. It folds up really nice for easy carrying and packing. All the trays come off easily for easy cleaning. It has 3 heights so the baby can have a perfect level for sitting at the table like a big kid. The whole chair is very easy to wash off any food. I use this chair all the time when going over to friends or visiting family. It provides an easy way to feed my daughter on the go and you don't have to mess around with her sitting on your lap. The straps adjust to fit almost any dining room or kitchen chair.
5,LOVE IT!,"Won't be able to add a whole lot that hasn't been said already, but I got to use this when I was babysitting my niece for the weekend and now I'm looking to get one for my 18 year old. Perfect!"
5,GOOD SIZE & PRICE WITH SAFETY,"I was a little unsure but I read the reviews & felt confident enough to order it. Glad I did- the small size with portability is great. The adjustable features, 3 heights & 3 ""tummy"" depths will help to ensure baby can use this for a few years, since it converts to a backless booster seat. It's totally ""hoseable"", trays dishwasher safe so it's sanitary- so necessary to keep baby safe. Many high chairs can only be wiped off, not totally sprayed plus the legs can be unstable, whereas this goes on any sturdy chair. Only problem that may arise is since the legs area is molded, doesn't look too wide for later. It's perfect for families instead of needing a bulky high chair plus you can take it with you for visiting with baby."
5,Excellent product,"This a very sturdy, portable and well-conceived product. We have used this over past 5 years and have recommended to numerous friends. My kids automatically look for this high chair when its time to eat.This high-chair helped instill some discipline in eating habits of my kids. The chair is extremely portable and easy to use. We have taken it both on vacations in USA and for longer international trips.Simply one of the best investments ever made in baby gear!"
4,Great for Grandma's,I initially bought this chair to take on vacation and it was perfect. Compact and light. Now we keep it at Grandma's house so the kids always have somewhere to sit without having to get out Grandma's big bulky highchair. The height of the chair can be adjusted which is great and I love that it has two seperate trays - the only thing that would make it perfect is if the white top tray had grips on the front as well as the back. My 15 month old has figured out how to take the white top tray off while he is eating.
5,PERFECT - Just what was needed,I gave this to my son and daughter-in-law. They live in a VERY small apartment and this was just what they needed. My grandson loves sitting in the chair. Easy to clean and travels to Grandma's house just perfect.I highly recommend.
5,Perfect seat for a growing toddler,"Our two year old was getting tired of sitting in his high chair, but wasn't tall enough to sit in a regular chair. This booster seat is the perfect compromise. We have it set to the lowest setting and he is able to sit right at the table (without the tray) and eat with everyone else. The straps make it super secure on the chair, but it also seems pretty easy to take along with us when traveling. Great product and a great value."
5,Great Seat,I think this seat is great as it really feels like you have a complete high chair with you once you attach it to the chair. It attaches very securely and the tray is great. It is easy to keep in the trunk and you can carry it into a restaurant or someone's house no problem and have it hooked up in a few seconds. I like the fact that I don't have to worry about what type of tables the place has as you do with the clip-on seats. You can also position the seat next to you as you would a normal high chair instead of being restricted to something attached to the table.
1,Danger of baby getting hurt,The top tray fastens to the product on the inside towards the baby. If you try to remove tray when baby is in seat it will hit baby in the face when it snaps off! I tried to remove the tray to clean the surface and was extra careful not to let the tray hit my baby's face but it did anyway.Also the bottom tray that fastens on the sides does not come off easily. If you encounter a choking situation it is not easy to remove baby from seat quickly. I will be returning product.
4,"Love it, except......","I really love this chair, especially the color, which is why I bought it in the first place. The only thing I don't like is that the white cover tray can easily be removed by a small child. In fact they can get their fingers pinched under it. I wish it attatched more securely."
5,Economical space saving high chair/booster seat,I bought this when my daughter turned 4 months old. I knew right away this was the perfect choice for us because I didn't have any room in my kitchen in my condo to feed my daughter in a regular high chair. Attaching the tray wasn't too hard to figure out. I actually like that I can't remove it too easily so that my toddler won't try and remove it herself. The adjustable height feature is fantastic too. Very easy to clean because you can throw it in the dishwasher or wash it really quick in the sink and then spray it down with a little water and rubbing alcohol mixture to disinfect. Even if I had the option and space for a high chair I'd still pick this Deluxe Booster as my first choice again! Love it :)
5,Vacation 'must have',"We purchased the booster seat for our vacation/visit to grandparents. It was great. Easy to pack, set up and store out of the way."
5,We bought 4 of these things,"With this price, and the fact this is such an awesome chair that can be used anywhere, folds, and carries, and has lots of trays and covers....and THIS THING ROCKS."
2,Poor Quality,I took the booster seat out of the box & put the strap over my should & the strap broke loose from the base. Looks like the thread used to seal the strap into the base broke free. I had to redo the strap & secure it.Poor quality to have it break 5 mins out of the box.
3,great for $25,"My son is 4.5 months (16 lbs) and fits in this seat pretty well. After about 15 minutes, though, he tires of it as he is not able to keep his balance perfectly and there isn't any side support besides the straps. We've taken it to restaurants and gotten many jealous glances from kids and parents alike! I use it at home also since we don't have a full size highchair yet, but I think we'll get the Space Saver one next as it looks much more comfortable with all the padding and reclining options. I would recommend this chair if you aren't sure about a full size high chair yet and your child doesn't need to be in it for very long feeding sessions."
2,Fall risk,"I had the same problem as another reviewer with my 16mo old daughter pushing her feet against the table and tipping back her chair. This incident occurred on the first day of use, so it was not just a fluke among many sittings. Our chairs are solid wood and not flimsy. Fortunately, I was quick enough to catch her. Otherwise, she would have hit the floor backward. I imagine this issue is common to many boosters and not just this one.If you were willing to place the chair on the floor, it would be a nice seat for a younger baby. Unfortunately, the tray is already too tight to fit over our daughter's legs, despite the fact that she is slim for her age."
2,too short,"too short and doesn't really boost...if you use it just as a chair with the tray it's fine, but your table better be tall or else it won't push in under the table with this seat attached"
2,Not that comfy,This seat is not comfortable. It's stiff and provides nowhere for my baby to rest his head. I like the idea that it's compact but it's not ideal if you want your baby to sit at the dinner table for 20 minutes or more for family dinner. I ended up buying a regular graco highchair instead. He can lean back his head in it and is so comfortable-- he actually will sit in it and play while I cook.
1,"Not brand new. DIrty, scratched used product","This is the second fisher-price product I have bought on amazon that arrived in bad condition. I am so very disappointed because I was getting everything together for my child's first solid meal and opened up the box to clean it. Once I took off the plastic wrap I could tell right away this was a used product. its scratched up pretty bad and there is dirt in the scratches. At first I thought it was just minor dirt from the factory but then I turned it upside down and the little feet underneath it are filthy and show clear signs of being worn down. I guess when someone uses it and decides to return it, amazon just repackages it and sends it to another unsuspecting person. I would give zero stars if I could"
5,Perfect for travel and restaurants,"This is a wonderful booster seat. My son is now 14 mo. old, and we bought it when he was around 10 mo. old. I wish I would have gotten it sooner. It is great for eating out - no touching those restaurant highchairs/boosters with all those germs. Who knows how clean those things are? Also, it gives him a tray as opposed to many restaurant booster and high chairs. I can finally put his food down and not worry about what he is touching and trying to spray Lysol on everything. It's great for travel as well. People ask us all the time where we got this, and I tell them it's a baby ""must have""."
4,Great Seat!,"I bought this seat for my son when he was four months old. He is 2/1/2 years old now, and still using this seat. I love it because it doesn't take up much space in the kitchen, unlike a regular highchair, it travels with us easily when we are going to visit friends or grandma, and it transitions nicely to a booster seat that scoots right up to the table when the kids get older. The seat has adjustable legs to raise and lower it to the level that you want, to be closer to you when you are feeding, or to fit under the table when used as a booster. The only thing I didn't like about the seat is that the white, compartment tray that easily snaps onto the original blue tray also snaps off easily. I choose not to use it, as my son just yanks it right off when I try. All in all, a great seat, so good that I bought a second one for my ten month old daughter, since her brother is still using the first!"
4,"Perfect for taking to restaurants, grandma's, or using in another room of your house","I bought this when my baby was just starting to eat rice cereal. She was tiny and couldn't sit up without help so the fact that this was a small booster was perfect. At first we used this as our only highchair at home. We also take it with us to restaurants. We put it right on the table so the baby's at eye level and she entertains herself with toys or finger foods so that my husband and I can eat for a change! It's easy to clean and the dishwasher-safe tray is wonderful.The only reason I'm planning to get a full sized high chair is because she's now starting to feed herself more and since the tray doesn't wrap around the sides, I end up with a huge mess on the floor afterwards. But this was totally worth the $20 I spent on it!"
1,Thumbs DOWN,"I recently purchased this seat for my 16 month old. Who is 33 inches tall and 25 pounds. We just needed something for going over to friends and/or family dinners/lunches. My child looked like a giant in this seat. He's much to big. The tray was on the lower part of his belly(leaving his bib out in the open to play with), and his buns were just about to big to sit in the seat.I guess it's a nice booster for a smaller child, but if you are looking for something your child can use for a while I would recommend ""The First Years"" booster seat with tray. It works much better for a larger child..."
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered 2 of these and both of the 1/4"" ends feel a little loose. One is loose enough that the connection cuts in and out sometimes. The other one seems to be fine but considering how loose it is I never really trust it. Maybe I just got a bad one but I would recommend staying away from these."
4,good deal/good service,The free $ dollar gift certificate was a good deal. Over all ofoto.com's prints seem a tad better than .... The interface and ease of use was about the same. The only thing I did not like was Ofoto's PC software did not save the current set of images as you worked on them. I had a few cases where I did not finish cropping images and quit the program or it crashed and I had to go back in and start over....
4,This ie really great !!,"With all these Digital cameras that are comming out , it is really important that the printing services also develop at a fast rate, and This offer is really the means to promotes and gives the customers the chance to know of the various options available to print the digital photosReally Great !"
4,"Software good, print need bit more help","the software is pretty user friendly, I would recommend this product to users to try out. beats printing at home, with the expensive ink."
4,Good photo service,"I tried Ofoto serveral times. The service is good and it is easy to share the pictures with friends online. Usually, I can get the photos in time. The property of the photos is good, but not excellent. But considering you need not to have the photo printer, need not to go to the photo shops outsider, Just stay at home and click, and wait for the delivery, it is really great."
4,"Great Product, Even Better with $25 gift certificate",This is a real great deal. I finially got a place to print photos from my Nikon Coolpix
5,How can you go wrong?,"What a great deal. Amazon gives you the photo software for free, Ofoto gives you 25 prints. And for your effort you also can earn a $25.00 gift certificate!Ofoto does a great job of making prints. I use a Nikon 950 to shoot my pics and the prints from Ofoto are undistinguishable from traditional photos. What do you have to lose? Give it a try today."
4,The best product I have seen in online and offline photos,I saw it at a friend of mine and it was quite rich in functionality. I never used Ofoto and I think I will use it and recommend it.
3,Ofoto on Line,"I used this service about a year ago. the photos were of high quality,that is the prints were,the prewiew on line weren't very clear.The processing seemed to take for ever.Then after they were ready to see on line,it took weeks to get prints back. I suggest you check out the prices after the special offer,they were quite steep.This is one of the reasons I did not give it a high rating. There are other companies out there with the same service,check out them all before you make that decesion."
1,GET CODEBREAKER!,"As you'll see on the box of this product in big letters it says ""THE WORLDS MOST POWERFUL GAME ENHANCER."" It probably would be if you could get it to work. I made the mistake of buying this....The longest I ever got it to work was about 2 days. After that it just froze up my PS2 and I would have to restart it. It is a very clumsy way of getting the codes you want to have and play them. after you select the codes you want you push the eject button and put in the game you want to play. Of coarse the PS2 is not really made for this operation and freezes up on you. Also it was made in 2002 so don't expect to see any new game codes on this. And you shouldn't use any of your favorite games on this because it broke on of mine. If your going to cheat get the codebreaker but I'd recomend not cheating at all. The good thing though is it gives you a 8mb memory card and a cd with some PS1 codes..."
1,Worlds Worst Game Enhancer,"Never Buy,I got it to start once but that was when i first bought it and after that it Always froze up, worst thing I have ever bought"
1,NOOOOO this [stinx] reliability is not in the cards,this AR [stinx] big time have talked to many people that all have the same problems with it not loading or freazin up.. so buy at own risk ...
3,action replay 2,"I own one of these and i think its fairly good, I owned a similar item for my playstation 1 which i thought was a bit easier to use but i've forgotten the name. the main point i would like to make is regarding the last persons review where he claims his brother works at sony and helps design the playstation, and games such as silent hill and virtual fighter. I would like to point out that sony is a massive company, and has different teams to design hardware and software, and most of these are based in japan, and he seems to be from america. Also Silent Hill is made by Konami, in Japan, and Virtual Fighter is a Sega game, also based in Japan. Neither of the games are made by Sony, just for their hardware. I'm not saying your not being honest, it just sounds a bit far fetched. No, wait, actually, your talking rubbish."
2,Whose idea was this? Please wake Bobby Columby up.,"Evidently, someone turned on a microphone to record the concert tour following up B, S & T's least successful album ever, ""Nuclear Blues"". The positive aspect of this album is that it contains an upbeat and punchy version of ""Gimme That Wine"" originally from the ""Brand New Day"" album. ""Trouble in Mind"" and ""Shake a Hand"" are also worthwhile. Unfortunately, the group degrades the more prominent and familiar tracks by compressing them into a medley. The ""Nuclear Blues"" tracks are regrettably performed in their entirety. I suppose there is nothing we can do about those paronoia nuclear blues. If you are looking for a great B, S & T live album, seek out ""Live and Improvised"" recorded after the release of their ""New City"" album. P.S. Does anybody know how many times DCT has recorded a version of ""I'll Drown In My Own Tears?"" I count four. If at first you don't succeed . . ."
2,just wasn't what I was looking for..,"I was looking for recipes, menu ideas to follow that are simular to The Seattle Sutton program that my mother is using. Instead this book felt like testimonials to encourage the reader to enroll in her delivery/take home program (more than 100 dollars per week, per person!) Maybe an entertaining read if you enjoy family history/heritage as it does have plenty of family stories, however, from a diet book perspective, I just wasn't impressed."
1,Worst Picture Quality Ever,"This DVD is presented in 1.33:1 and looks like someone took an old, very old, VHS copy that had been watched a few hundred times and copied it over to DVD format. Very grainy and extremely soft picture. The sound is spotty and muted.The film itself is semi-decent late night cable fair, only stands out because Nastassja Kinski's 19 year old boobs.This is for the DVD version with amazon.com's ASIN of B0000DG98R."
3,Beautiful young women,"I saw this movie in the cinema many years ago. The movie shows Natassja Kinski at age 19 topless as well as other 2 or 3 young women (one a blue-eyed brunette even more beautiful than Natassja), also in several stages of nudity; in a tale of repressed girls at a private school in Europe, who try to get to know romance and possibly also sex, in secret, with the young men from a nearby boys private school. Only the beauty of the young women justifies the movie, which otherwise is rather cliche. Last year I bought a dvd from a different maker (Front Row Features) which did NOT play in my dvd player but DID PLAY in my computer's dvd drive. This DVD, however, played without problems in my DVD player. I gave it 3 stars because the quality of the transfer of its images to DVD is only moderate, and because the extent of the scenes of female beauty can not lift this movie any higher."
3,sam got a splinter,this game is fun and bonus level's add to the game but game's good and bad are good thermal and night vision goggle's and gas grenade's cool move's like drop down or snap neck shimmy climb pipes put leg's up on pipe's bad unrealistic enemy shoot or kill z z z rise's from there head when taken down only use goggle's in area's you need goggle's and touch hostage run away touch's door freeze!! disapper and that's it but if you are aganist and bad thing's in here don't get if not get it if it's under 3.50$ don't pay for a new enjoy if you can
2,Bland game,"The original Splinter Cell on the Xbox simply blew me away with its awe-inspiring graphics and gameplay. The GBA version is a bland 2D side scroller that doesn't even come close to 1/10th of the fun of the Xbox version. The graphics has some kind of industrial overtone that just looks awful, and Sam Fisher's missions just look ridiculous in a 2D environment, because the stealth factor just isn't there. The GBA version is also quite short, so if you absolutely have to play the game, rent it."
4,Looks alright.,"I have played Splinter Cell on pc and it's awesome;however, on gameboy advance it might not be as good. The graphics look unbelievably good for a portable, but it is only 2-D so that takes away some of the greatness of the game. But, just like on the pc version, you get all the great weapons,gadgets,etc. And you can still do lots of cool stuff like repel from the tops of buildings(Jump down using a rope or something), use bad guys as human shields, climb across things upside down, bug phones, sniper people from far away and many other things. If you liked the platform versions of this game or if you are a big fan of games like metal gear solid, then this would most certainly be something worth buying."
3,Great and the only switch of this type on Amazon,I got one of these for my brother who is also a drummer. He has an excellent Shure mike with no on/off switch. I got this as a present and it has worked perfectly so far. I recommend it to people who need this function added because you are not connected to a board or don't have a sound man!
4,Meets my needs,"This little inexpensive on/off switch is great. I have a set up where the person speaking on a mike is far away from the soundboard and I often do not have a sound person operating the board. So I wanted an on/off switch that can be used by the miked person so they could quickly kill the mike if they had to sneeze or whatever. My concern with this switch is that it would make an audible pop when turning off or on. It does not. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that once you plug this thing in, with the xlr connector on the mike, the xlr connector on the mic cable, you're left with about 6 inches of inflexible connectors which is kinda awkward. Also, I worry about the connection long term. We will see."
2,One big design flaw,"The Cokin 77mm Z series adapter ring works fantastically as advertised, and as the previous review said it does screw on and off very easily. It is solid, does its job of holding the filter holder on, etc..The problem comes when you take a photo of something bright (which is pretty much what these things are for) and you get a burry white arc from the reflection of the text ""COKIN - 77 - th 0.75 - FRANCE"" that is painted on the outside of the adapter.The only way to fix this is to paint over it, which is what I intend to do today. If I wanted DIY, I would've done it myself, so instead of rating 5 stars, I'm rating 2 stars. I'll rate 5 if they ever fix this and send me one that doesn't have the problem."
1,Works but print is reflected and captured in images,"As another reviewer noted, this adapter works but the white print on the adapter ring reflects off the lens-facing side of the filters in bright sun light and so is captured in the pictures. Considering that, I have to wonder what kind of testing this product went through before being released. I used a black permanent marker to color over the white lettering but it also reflects light so care must be taken."

2,Out of Date Museum Guide,"When I bought this there was no indication of what it was about.I had hoped that it would discuss today's ""living dinosaurs"" such as the Komodo dragon and other such large reptiles.Instead I received a book which is basically just a list of museums which house bones of extinct reptiles with some reviews that are largely out of date anyway."
5,not used as a toy..,"I collect nativity sets and Nesting dolls, so how perfect is this. Colors are bright, pieces are well made. It looks beautiful on display during the Holiday season."
3,History Lessons Begin Here,For those that need a tutorial on the origins of the music genre called funk. The trail begins here. There are some tunes that will be instantly recgonizable. There are some that you instantly recgonize from the hooks that have been sampled and oversampled ad infinitum. There are some questionable filler songs here (Garbage Man is to be avoided) But all in all the liner notes and music will be enought to pique interest of the novice fan and provide info for the serious fan.
1,Poorly Organized and Unimaginative...skip this one!,"First, this is not a book solely about parties for the Millennium. It is a book about party themes with a couple pages added to the front about the Millennium. Second, the attempt at a creative layout actually detracts from the book and makes it difficult to read. Lastly, the ideas are generally unimagineative. I read much of the book looking for any worthwhile idea for a party I am planning and found almost none.Not worth the money--try some of the other books out there. ""The New Year's Eve Compendium"" by Todd Lyon is better. Still not great, and doesn't have all of the color photos like this book, but it is at least informative and original."
1,tales that exaggerate too much in writing,jonathan winters is great while watching himreading him made me feel that his tales were exaggerated and too unbelievable. i quickly put it down
2,Not So Much Fun for Nerds,If you were one of the nerds in high school this movie will doubtless raise not so fond memories. Revenge of the Nerds has a few amusing moments (aka the talent show) but the genuine meanspiritness of the jocks in this movie inspired more than a full bullies. While the movie purports to be on the side of the nerds the characters are so stereotypical that you can't really identify with them. If you're looking for cheap laughs yeah I guess this movie is worth watching but if you are looking for a realistic portrayal of people labelled as nerds then look for the dvd of Freaks and Geeks.
4,Atomic Wedgie,"If you love Revenge of the Nerds you will love this! All of the movies in 1 pack, great deal, great price!"
5,"The Greatest Story Ever told, well, almost.",A must see for nerds and jocks alike.Can't we all just get along?
3,Nerds - i'm in love,"Cool collection, well maybe not exactly cool but very funny stuff. The extras on the original are good too love the commentary, funny stuff"
3,not as funny as i remembered it,well i watched this during the 80s when it came out so i decided to go ahead and buy the dvd. its not that funny as i thought it would be or as i remembered it to be.. BUT you are getting 2 movies for the price of 1 so that kinda makes up for it..

5,Nerds,"I LOVE REVENGE OF THE NERDSThis 4 movie set covers the two theaterical film and the two TV films.

Lets just say this, NERDS RULE!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
4,Works great,I am now able to plug by computer & iPad into the school's sound board. Wish I would have gotten the 6 ft version though.

5,great cable for hooking up mac mini,Used this cable to hook up my mac mini to my m-audio av40 speakers. perfect solution that keeps the RCA inputs free. Pretty decent quality on the cable.
5,"Noise Free, Perfect Fit!","I'm using this cable to supply audio from the line out on my FIIO DAC, to M-Audio AV40 Monitors. I haven't heard any interference or un-wanted sound and they are a perfect fit; solid at all connect points.Note: I actually was receiving a VERY slight hiss using the 1/8 Inch to RCA cable included with the speakers. The switch to this cable completely got rid of it. Tested it again to make sure I wasn't going crazy and sure enough always get a slight hiss with the RCA cable (could be the RCA input on the monitors).I would HIGHLY recommend this cable to consumers who want noise free (budget friendly) connection to a sound card/usb dac."
5,Great Product,Great product and great price. Use this to hook my ipod to a mixing board and it works perfectly and the sound comes across crystal clear.
1,Defective left ch. out of the box,"As stated, left channel is bad at the 1/8"" end. Not worth paying to return, I'll just fix it with an end I had laying around."
5,Best book on Cortázar's stories,"It really is, YES, John Sanjines gets to the rigour of things! He is a real semiotician and with a poets heart. Great read for someone who likes to think about how fiction works and is made. Even dreams have a construction.One word. Terrific! Looking forward to John's next book."
1,Pile of sh**,"It is rare that a film of such poor quality gets published in any form. It appears that a bunch of bodybuilders were given poor scripts, poor special effects, and worse advice on acting. The film appears to have been coded with the MPG1 video standard and badly at that. The story is terrible, and seems to assume that you know what the hell is going on.AVOID THIS ONE LIKE THE PLAGUE. (I made the mistake of buying it.... SUCKER!!!!)I only give this ONE star because I can't give it NONE.........."
1,very incomprehensable,"I was required to read this text for a philosophy of science course. I only read 3 pages and I attempted several times to read more but I would be left not knowing what I had just read. A page would take me 5 minutes and I still wouldn't understand what I'd read. Although I am reading at a collegiate level, this book really is bad and didn't facilitate much discussion. Other classmates share the same dilemna."
4,A point to remember,"A point to remember - this was the first book in the ""shared world"" genre. It spawned several copycats - the Hell series comes to mind, as does Wild Cards. Sure, there had been 'round robin' books before, but this was the first shared world.As the first attempt at a new genre this book is good. Alas, few people used each other's characters, but that was corrected by book two when the concept had come together better. MZB introduced a character that later appeared in another Shared World (kind of violating the premise of both series) which later had its own book (collecting and adding to the short stories about it).After burning out around book 10 (but struggling on to book 12) the series bunt out, but it seems that Lynn Abbey (ex-wife of teh founding editor) has restarted it - so this book can serve as a base line for the new series."
3,Just a bunch of good short stories,"If you are in the mood from some fantasy short stories that have a good action pace to them, then this is worth reading.What I read I liked. My only thing with the book is that it is exactly that...a bunch of short stories that take place in the same universe(I kinda knew this from the start but didnt' really think much of it till I was 2/3rds of the way through).In my opinion if there were reoccuring characters (if there were I don't remember seeing them) then that would have been more enjoyable to me."
2,Not Anything Especially Great,"It started off interesting with Asprin's short story - after that, it took a steady downhill run. I'm sure that many of these authors have written better as time has gone on. This one - well it just didn't hold my interest past the initial story that sets up the whole world."
3,A personal guilty pleasure,"This first book didn't particularly strike me when I read it. None of the writers are exactly masters in the field, and the stories are all action-oriented (don't expect any philospohical insight here). However, as I began to read more of the series, especially by book 3, I started getting into it. It becomes interesting to see how the different plot strands connect to the overall saga.I'm only on book 5 now, but I'll probably read the rest eventually. If you have some time to kill, check these out, but otherwise, stick to the more established fantasy writers (Jordan, Eddings, Fiest, Goodkind, Martin, Brooks, etc...) who do a much better job of developing character and setting."
5,One walk a day,"I like this book very much. I was in New York City for four days, and I did one walk each day. Each walk (there are twenty three walks in total) is written by a different author, who has memories, passions, or experiences with a particular neighborhood. As I was walking in one neighborhood, I was trying to find the old pickle shop; in an other neighborhood I was looking for the cabaret theatre/restaurant. I did all the things written in the walk chapter I was reading. I ate the desert in that French cafe and I bought some cheese from the shop mentioned in the chapter. This book is, I think, for people who love history, life, art, people and food. I recommend reading the particular walk chapter in advance, and then reading the same chapter piece by piece as you do the walk.Next time I will do the next four walks that I already chose."
5,Unbelievable!,"I picked up a pair of these to run off of my computer. I'm listening an mp3 on em right now, hooked up to a junk amp meant to power a set of logitec surround speakers and all I can say is wow! Given higher quality power and a better source (dvd audio or CD) it could only get better from here.I've owned piles of really expensive stereo equipment home/auto and have been through about 4 different surround systems for my computer. I can tell you that you can junk the 5.1 or 7.1 computer surround systems. None sound even 1/2 as good a pair of these Polks.One thing you also dont really have to worry about is price. Polk pretty much price fixes everything so the cost here on Amazon is going to be as good as anywhere you look. Free shipping wouldnt hurt either! For a bit over 3 bills you cannot go wrong on a pair."
