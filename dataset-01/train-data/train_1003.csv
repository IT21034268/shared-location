2,Two big issues,"I read great reviews about this program and thought I'd try their 30-day free trial. The program downloaded easily and installed without a hitch. But it hogged all of my computer's resources so that I couldn't do anything while it was turned on. It immediately started scanning and 9 hours later it was up to file 350,000 and still going. I turned it off so that I could do some work and discovered that when I tried to access Internet Explorer, it would open to my home page, but would immediately shut down as soon as I tried to enter a new address or do a search. Nothing I did would allow me to access the Internet. The only reason I gave this program 2 stars instead of 1 is that it uninstalled easily and completely and my computer is now back to normal."
1,"numerous conflicts, locks-up with ""corrupt"" Outlook files","Conflicts with numerous programs including: Zone Alarm Pro, Windows Defender, and many others. Moreover, it locks-up with ""corrupt"" Outlook files. It is ""secure"" because there are no work-arounds. The software should have better error trapping when it encounters ""problematic Outlook files."" Their support staff indicate that the Outlook problems are a known issue.My suggestion to potential buyers of security software would be to purchase security software ""suites"" (antivirus, firewall, antispam, etc.) that are bundeled and therefore presumably interact in a friendly syergistic manner."
1,"Blue Screens Constantly, Don't Ruin Your Computer","An absolute disaster. I bought this product to replace Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2006, whose subscription had expired and with which I was dissatisfied (a resource hog that makes the PC barely useable). Unfortunately, Kaspersky constantly blue screens, initially with complaints about klif.sys but now the whole system is shot and I get random blue screens every few minutes. Fortunately I made a block by block copy of my hard drive to another identical hard drive (by booting Tom's RTBT Linux from a floppy) before uninstalling AntiVirus 2006 and installing Kaspersky so I can go back to the way things were and hopefully get my money back for Kaspersky, the worst and most unstable software since DOS. Yes, I'll renew my Symantec AntiVirus subscription, even though I am not happy with it."
3,"CPU hog, too slow, too complicated","I installed this after my PC got attacked by malware through symantec desktop agents. I was disappointed. My conclusion is that we still do not have a good enough desktop virus protection software. I have tried McAfee, Symantec, Microsoft and CA. They all have issues. I am sure someone will figure this out but they have not."
2,Major problems with Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6.0,"The product that arrived in the box could not be activated with the accompanying key on My WIndows 98SE system. I finally installed successfully by downloading a terail version of the program and using the activation code that came with the boxed product.After a month, Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6.0 stopped working. It loads on boot-up and then crashes. An email to technical support produced two suggestions: (1) use the repair feature (six tried did not fix the problem), and (2) reinstall the product. While I haven't tried that yet, what I really think should have been done is to send me a new, working version of the product by overnight delivery."
1,Windows 98 didn't accept.,"I really cannot review this product as I returned it. Did not work on my windows 98. Have not received a refund yet, but I'm hoping it is coming this month. Patricia McClellan"
2,Short on performance,"If you're buying this so that you won't have a long download on your dialup, forget it! All the CD does is connect you to the internet for your 8Mb program download! Once this is done, the ""fun"" really starts.The program is basically incompatible with Earthlink's ""Total Access"", and at least in WinME will cause your computer to require a reboot everytime you try to go on line. So, you'll have to disable ALL the real time protection aspects of the software. It will still scan (and find) viruses on your drives, but you'll have to initiate these manually.Tech support for the program seems to be non-existant. I've tried several times to get answers to questions through their email routes - never any answer!In short, it's way too much money for a program with as many shortcomings as this one has."
5,Does Not Slow Down System and Keeps a Low Profile.,I was looking a reliable av program that is not a resource hog and does not ask questions for every action taken. Keep in mind that this is for a relatives system. Kaspersky fit this bill just fine. The system has been virus free for over a year and I have no phone calls about issues.
2,Good program,"The last 2 versions of Norton's anti-virus was difficult to install, and even harder getting it to work right. Their customer service, even though they speak English, I don't think they understand. None of their solutions came close to fixing the problems.Kaspersky 6.0 was easy to install, easy to set up, and works great. I had no problem updating the program the first time even though I still have dial up. It does not create problems with my WIN XP, programs. I did exit Spy Sweeper while installing Kaspersky to avoid a problem.I also use TREND MICRO on another computer, and it works okay. Only problem it has long download updates. Their customer service solved a minor problem with one call.Reading the reports on Norton's Anti-virus, I think I made a good choice.Richard Holmes, Irving, TEXAS"
1,Terrible Experience,"I ordered this product back in August, supplying all the correct information along with valid credit card information. If you read the product information, it comes directly from Amazon. It was suppose to ship within 1 or 2 days.A week later, I received an email saying the product would be delayed. I tried to cancel the order but Amazon would not let me cancel! They claimed the order was processed and shipped!As of today, nearly two weeks after the order, there is NO indication from USPS they have received the order. These guys lie, so I choose to discontinue doing business with them! Not even 1 Star."
3,Slows down my computer,"Kaspersky Anti-virus software seems to do provide all the security against viruses and spyware. It does a complete scan of the computer and fixes problems; however it slows down my computer. This surprised me since I have a cable modem, but internet pages take longer to load than dial-up. At this point, I have disabled the anti-virus software until I can add more memory (RAM) to my system. Even though I did get this product free-after-rebate, I wish I had not purchased it. Many ISPs provide FREE anti-virus software plus much more, which can be downloaded from their website. This is what I recommend others to do and what I will do in the future."
4,Kaspersky AV 6.0,Installed nicely (Norton never did install for me properly). Seems to be doing what it claims.
1,Total Disaster,"I tried three separate installations. The Program froze my brand new XP Computer. The only way I could get out was to shut down manually, boot into safe mode and elect not to work in safe mode but to do a system restore. For me this Program is toxic. I threw it out and purchased AVG 7.5 Anti-Virus Professional Edition which installed quite easily and is working very well. For those who want a free program there is an AVG Free with less features."
5,Work great!,"I have got a virus that cause files ""comment.htt"" appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus. I tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective. So I try KAV and it works! Also KAV does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus. Autoupdate feature is cool. We do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable."
2,Keeps shutting down,"This is a good product, except it keeps shutting down when I have my outlook or when I have a web page open. My main goal for an antivirus would be to run when I search the web or get in new emails! What good is it if it shuts down when these are open! It did find a trojan on my first scan. This was one that Norton missed. I will be getting NOD32 soon. Sorry this product did not work for me! It was very easy to use."
2,Thought it would be better,"After several attempts at installing and performing full scans window is occasionally sluggish. Have experienced new compatibility issues with other programs only after installing this product that worked fine with AVG Free. No viruses nor spyware found from scans, but overall performance is not optimal. Running WinXPSP2 on Dell Dimension 8250, hope that helps."
5,So Easy,Kaspersky was so easy to install and get up and running I could not belive it. The hourly updates are great! The update files are so small you don't notice that it's happening. After I installed and ran Kaspersky it found viruses and spyware that AGV and Adaware let through. You can't go wrong.
4,Works well,"The first time I installed this software I tried to make some changes to when and how it scanned my files. I'm not sure if that caused the problems or if it was something else, but soon after the computer went haywire and crashed over and over. I uninstalled and reinstalled and now everything is working great. The interfaces seem easy enough to use and the updates are automatic. I purchased this software on the advice of numerous computer magazine reviews and different computer gurus I know. Unless something goes wrong again, I will continue to use it."
5,Awesome shoes!!!,I love the material of these shoes! They allow my feet to breath and are great for summer weather. I am extremely pleased with the comfort.
3,Great for limited uses,"The clamp mechanism for the laces on these shoes broke within seconds after I put them on. The laces are too short to tie, so I had to replace them. Having said that, the shoe is perfect for cycling or hiking in creek beds - it's light and airy, dries very quickly, and is well ventilated. I sure wouldn't use it for extended weight-bearing exercise with high impact since there is little or no arch support."
3,70 minutes of not sure what,"A large percentage of tracks on GOLDEN HITS are the original recordings-- a few of these are a bit distorted or heavily filtered. There's definitely a percentage of rerecordings here, too.Best advice is listen to all the 30 seconds samples and decide for yourself if GOLDEN HITS is worth owning. (Note: this reviewer passed it up.)"
3,not a bad flick,I speak fluent Spanish and I liked most of it. It actually seemed like it was filmed in the barrio.
1,Don't waste your Money,"This is probably the worst video I have seen ever.The video seems amateur at best, there are parts in which the guy is out of frame, shots are done out of a 45 degree angle, the DVD seems to have been burn at a home computer at a very low quality.DVD is oily when it arrived, my guess it was handled poorly by those recording on their home computer. It is so oily that it skips and then it starts all over again because it makes my DVD player hicup.This is not like any yoga DVD, it is very short sections of different poses, does not take you through any type of workout at all.P90x yoga is million times better for conditioning than this piece of crap, I will probably trash the DVD and keep the box for some other DVD."
4,"Useful, practical, do-able, great for New Years' resolutions","I bought this book a few days after buying an old house in need of much work. We have decided to adopt at least one item each year from the book as a New Years resolution. They range from the very easy (Clean your roof! Check for leaks!) to the advanced-skill or hire-a-contractor level. But all are detailed, and explain why they are included. Some do not apply to every house, such as the basement hints, but everyone will find something that applies to their house. The book is written in language that you don't have to be a builder to understand; you don't even have to be an experienced do-it-yourselfer to get started. Warning: after starting this book, you will become very paranoid about what could go wrong in your house! However, this is a good thing, as paranoia is the first step toward preservation."
5,"IF YOU CAN'T HAVE THE ALBUMS, TRY THIS","Desmond dekker is an old school artist of merit. I've been trying to get a hold of actual albums by this man on cd with no luck. There are plenty of compilations available but some are simply just too long. Enter 'Gimme Gimme'. Not only does it boast some of his great ones, but it also has the cohesiveness of a real studio album. One would think this was some long lost session instead of a collection. For those fans of Desmond with the Aces there's plenty to enjoy. Great disc for a great jamaican star."
4,Must Have,"This book is great for the newer student...old hands will find it not too helpful, so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. Otherwise this is a great book for a person new to the study of military science, military history, or strategy and tactics. This is a new student reference ""must have."" A student will be amply rewarded when they want a quick definiton of ""honey trap"" ""minimax"" ""RDO"" or a quick biography of say John Von Newumann."
1,Had High Hopes but Did Not Lose Weight,"I had such great success with Glenn Harrold's Deep Sleep CD (see my review), I had high hopes for this one. I am sad to say I did not have success.I can only guess, but I think that the message is not a good fit for me. The message is negative, along the lines of ""do not have yucky sweet things"". It was not a message that resonated with me. I tried it for months with no results.I more recently have purchased the much more costly series of CDs from Roberta Temes ""Enjoying Weight Loss"". I find myself much more drawn to her more positive approach and I AM finding modest success. Moreover I have a much more upbeat outlook, and find myself taking positive steps without resistance. (Roberta has a heavy New York accent which was very grating to me, but I have gotten used to it, sort of...)Good luck to you whatever you try."
2,OK BUT,"If you would be jolted by a male voice telling you how much more attractive you would be if you lost weight, don't buy this CD. There are plenty of other programs that emphasize treating your body well because you appreciate it NOW."
2,not so great,I have used hypnosis tapes before. Usually they are very relaxing. This one starts out with funkie music on both sessions. I like to listen to the tapes and go to sleep. At the end of the session it will have you wake up. Sound is of quality.
4,Effective,"This CD has definitely changed my attitude about food. I find myself making healthier choices. I also find myself thinking before I eat, determining whether I'm actually hungry or just bored or stressed out. I would have given this CD 5 stars if the music on the first track wasn't so cheesy. Otherwise, this product is definitely a great investment for my health."
3,It's ok...,"Well, I was definitely skeptical about using a hypnosis CD, but I thought if anything it would instill some positive reinforcements. It is a soothing CD to listen to, and I would think of some of the key phrases throughout my day, but other than that, I think it would be better used for relaxation rather than weight loss."
3,coaching,It helps if you use it everyday. Like listening to a coach. I can see a differance in my eating habits.
2,Difficult to understand,"Glenn Harrold is very hard to understand, so while listening to this CD instead of relaxing and hearing what he has to say I found myself trying to understand what he was saying, so this didn't do the trick. I will listen again to see if it becomes clearer since I only have listened to it once, but I have my doubts. I have another CD by another English author, and it's great, but this was very disappointing. Not recommended."
2,Did not work for me,"I guess it is a hit or miss with this kind of things...For me it is a miss...Honestly, I have a hard time believing that repeating to me that I am feeling good, safe, beautiful or anything else is going to prove true...His voice is not specifically annoying or anything like that...I guess I am not suggestible enough for it to be effective with me."
3,Some good things happen,"Hey!I enjoy some of this album a lot and all of this album a little, in other words as a whole record it's nice but not great, however some of the tunes are very good...If your finding Jason Falkner by following links from other bands then read all of the reviews with the understanding that people get really excited about good pop records because they are so rare. I would recommend ""Author Unknown"" by Jason, I enjoy it more than this CD, it's more versatile and the hooks are simpler and the songs seem less pompous and self serving...Please understand I am a fan of the man (Jason) but I won't get caught up in the fervor, it's a nice record, but it sounds like he's trying too hard."
5,Wonderful! On -par with The Beatles (as always),"Being a fan of Faulkner's ever since I was lent a copy of ""Ro Sham Bo"", I was eager to hear this album. (YES I use the term ALBUM, an ALBUM is a collection of anything, I HATE the term CD used to mean a collection of songs that happens to be released on CD as well as LP record, cassette, MP3, or whatever; a named group of songs is an ALBUM) Anyhoo, this was one of my best spent jinkers. Jason offers all types of song, for whatever mood you are in."
3,It's a bit stiff,"I've been a big fan of Jellyfish for a while, and stumbled across Jason Falkner not long ago. I've also heard some of his work from The Grays, which was quite impressive. So I laid down the cash to pick up this album, and I am disappointed. Jason plays all the instruments on the album, and without the feedback from a live band (Man, Jason, this Chorus stinks, why don't we try this...) the music is stiff, and a bit forced. My recommendation to Jason is this: Get a band, and let them have some input. You are great in a band, and not so great alone."
5,"Good production, good songs, funny picture","I really like the production of this one more than his first album. It's a much cleaner and crisper sound. I think the songs are also more consistent. Highlights: ""Revelation"", ""Eloquence"", ""Author Unknown"", ""The Plan"", ""I Already Know"", the rest of the songs. The CD booklet has a pretty funny picture of him (wearing lots of leather) being served drinks by a stewardess...flight attendant. That really doesn't add or take away from the CD in any way. I just thought I'd mention it. In closing, I'm honored to be on the same page as Eric Matthews (below). Thank you. Buy ""Can You Still Feel?"""
5,Absolutely stunning pop!!!!!!,"I was familiar with the name Jason Falkner,having seen Jellyfish when they toured Australia a few years back. I bought this CD on a whim as I was impressed with the cover art. I must now report that I'm sure that I have in my posession one of the finest and most consistent pop albums of ALL TIME. This is pure joy and I'm also stunned at the fact that Jason played the bulk of the instruments on this album as well. Sadly, I feel that this record will fall on largely deaf and ignorant ears(particularly in my country) as this music won't find a place on radio or TV. EVERYBODY should own records like this!"
5,Another Excellent Record by Jason,"Just got the new CD and again, I am extremely impressed with this guy's songwriting and record making ability. Awesome songs, a great musician. I hope he gets the recognition he deserves."
5,Wow!,"I've always believed that the true sign of a brilliant, growing artist was how their new work changes the way you see their old. Can you still feel? makes me unsure of whether or not I want to listen to Author Unknown again. It is incredible. I just hope plays some more dates in the US."
4,Sophomore...,"Honored to be alongside Mr. Matthews, too -- but why don't I feel as excited listening to this one as I did with the precious ""Presents Author Unknown?"" I don't know!Maybe because there are not as many hooks here as in the first one, not as many memorable moments? (Not a lovely ballad such as ""When My Heart Attacks?"")Oh well, if Mr. Eric The Genius LOVED it, what can I say? I'll go back to it...for the fourth time.Hey Eric (assuming it IS you), when will you regale us with your third? We're waiting!"
3,No Click...Plugs loosely,"When plugging into my samsung hdtv plasma it didnt 'click' into place and felt loose. I also plugged it into my polk receiver with the same results. Although it seemed to be a solidly built cable all around, It just didnt feel right when plugged in. Im glad I also bought the amazon basics version of this optical cable because that one clicked into place when plugged into both sources. I think i'll stick with amazon basics."
5,Great Optical Cable,"I bought another optical cable because I need an additional one for the cable box optical out to the audio receiver. I already have 1 cable that I bought from Best Buy in 2000 & I use that one for the DVD player. This cable seems to be better than the older one I have. The audio comparison between the 2 cables was noticeable. I was watching I think PTI on ESPN & tried switching the cables back & forth a couple of times. The audio, at least that's how it seemed to me, was louder with this cable. Don't know if they wear over time or something. I heard that optical cables don't like to be bent due to the fact that light can't bend. But I've been pretty careful with the other cable. The shipping was pretty quick & the price was good. I'm happy with my purchase. I would recommend this cable & Belkin's a good brand, you can't go wrong."
5,This is very good.,I was a bit worry that it cannot be tightly hold as some people pointed out. But my TV and BlueRay play don't have any problem and tightly hold it. Very good.!!!
4,"Good, but cheap","Cables work just fine, and the connection 'click' they make is pretty weak, but if it's connected it's fine. Just don't move anything around.These came in a box simply wrapped in an bag. The packaging felt very cheap, but I have no problem with the cable other than the clicking thing."
2,works but....,"The item works fine when it is plugged in, the problem is that it unplugs VERY easily. The part that holds the plug in place just does not ""snap"" in like my other cords. If you don't move the cord (or any other cords adjacent to it) its really not a problem, but if you components are in a hard to get to location (which mine are) and you move the item it is plugged into (to dust, or adjust cords, or add other components) then it does occasionally come unplugged. For that reason I ended up buying another cord to take its place and moved it to a location that is easier to get to and less likely to come unplugged."
2,Initial thoughts...,"I just received the cable and I have to say that it looks ands feel very substantial. Nicely molded ends, heavy appearing cable, etc. In fact, it looks better than two other optical cables I have, one of them Monster brand on which I got a good deal a while ago. But... as some others have talked about in their reviews, there is literally NO detent when plugging into either component. The cable I'm replacing is a very cheap (in appearance and cost) cable that has great detent. My concern is that it will come unplugged any time something gets moved or I dust. I should probably return it for another brand, but I'm too lazy so I used black electrical tape to secure it from coming out too easily. Neither end is in a location where you can see the tape so I don't care, but I have no doubt it will come apart with little provocation without it."
5,Get It.,If you need an optical cable then this is it. I have two different cables and this one is superior to the other. It is thicker so it's more durable. The price was great. I will buy more if the need arises.
5,Works with no problems,Plugged in to TV and Home theater and the sound is just fine. TV and audio are both Sony so it automatically switches to surround sound.
5,"Quality cable, shipped quick",Not much to say except the cable seems to be of high quality and shipped quickly. It works as it should with my Panasonic TV/Yamaha Receiver.
3,Item did not work as I had hoped,"Through no fault of this item, it did not work with my TV set. As a result, I sent it back."
5,It's a cable.,Works pretty well. I used it for TV to Home theater connection. It's flexible and well flexing it doesn't seem to cause any issues. I got it from lighting deals and I wish I bought few more for any possible future need :)
1,Don't waste your money...,"In general I've been happy with Belkin accessories, but this cable is the pits. It lasted less than a month! I used it to connect my HD/DVR cable box to my receiver. No crimps, kinks, or undue stress on it, but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent.I don't like to support the Monster Cable hype, but because of their lifetime warranty I bought their cable to replace this one. So far no problems!"
3,great product - operator error,Fast ship and the cable worked as expected...until I inadvertently put a sharp bend in it. It did not occur to me that the fiber optic cable would be fragile. I researched and found that this is a very common thing. It was a good price on the cable so I ordered another one. I have learned my lesson.....I don`t remember reading a warning on the packaging....perhaps they should advise a person that the glass can break easily.
4,Nice Quality,This product works very well for me. I have a yamaha hometheater and this one gives me awesome quality when I connect my Cable Box to Home theater using this cable.
3,I REALLY want to give a higher rating.,"Some explanations in the this book are very clear. However, the reader may often need to refer to the author's previous book -""Reliability and degradation of semiconductor lasers and LEDs""."
1,"When everyone is a centrist, what does it mean?","I was disappointed with the book. The first part of the book had a description of 'Centrism' that is relatively well-reasoned. The majority of the book has to do with describing individual politicians (or political races) involving Centrists. This is where the book fails. Of the presidents since FDR, the author classifies them all as Centrists, with the exception of LBJ, Ford, and GHW Bush. The real kicker came when he describes GW Bush and his 2000 campaign as centrist, and using ""Centrist"" as a description for the Reagan Conservative Revolution is more than just a stretch.I was looking for some glimmer of light for those of us who are dismayed by the strong partisanship in the US today. Instead, the author seems to embrace the partisans (mostly on the right) as centrists, while he ignores real centrists such as John McCain or Christine Todd Whitman."
1,Outdated and truly UN-moderate,"Finds too much fault with the left but does little to criticize the rightwing fascists. To Avalon, himself a worker under Rudy Guliani who goes fundraising all the time for his Repug cronies even in South Dakota and Mississippi, being a moderate means giving in to the rightwing fascists as much as possible without looking as rightwing-ish. In other words, just be rightwing-light and you'll automatically be billed a moderate. Worthless book."
3,Misrepresented,"This is NOT made by Churchill. It says ""Wessox Collection, made in Malaysia"" on the under side. The dishes are nice but I was expecting Churchill."
3,NOT made in England,"This set was supposed to be a present to match my friend's other Blue Willow set, which is original/made in England. Unfortunately, I could not give the set as a present, as it wouldn't be appropriate considering the maker. Even though the set is very nice, obviously inexpensive, and very well packed when was shipped, I didn't get as much of a good deal as I expected, because the product didn't match descriptions on the site.According to the other reviews, its 50/50 chance of getting your set made in Englad versus Malaysia. Good luck!"
3,"Looks nice, for clunky china",Not your fine china. More like the restaurant grade. but it is serviceable.
3,Look carefully!,"I ordered the 45 pc. set and the 20pc. set from Churchill. Unfortunately, I didn't read the product discriptions carefully and I now have 4 small bread plates and 8 salad plates and 4 round bowls and 8 flatter rimmed bowls. THE SETS DON'T MATCH!! So now I have pay more and order more cereal bowls and more salad plates in order to have a 12 pc. set of these things. Ugh. Also, the dinner plates are a bit small (10 inches)."
1,Very Sad but WAS English China,"Over the past several years I have purchased many pieces in this pattern. I now have service for 12 give or take a few pieces and I have a couple types of bowls also. Originally this set had a backstamp that said Royal Wessex Made in England. More recently the backstamp read Wessex Collection Made in England. I am very sad to hear that it has become Made in Malaysia. I was just about to purchase another couple pieces but I will have to get them elsewhere where I can make sure the backstamp says Made in England. I am sorry for those of you who thought you were getting English ones and didn't. Royal Albert also moved its production out of England and Johnson brothers has moved much of its production out of England too. If you want English china now, you'll have to go with another company like Spode."
4,"Made in Malaysia, but not a bad thing.","I thought maybe I would be lucky and get the ones made in England. It looks like all of them shipped from here on out will be from Malaysia. With that in mind, you are not getting the several hundred dollar set as the list price indicates. Nevermind that though and look at what you do get.You a get a very nice set for a very reasonable price. They get the job done in my household. They have held up over the several months I have owned them. No problems with scratches or anything like that. The heat nicely in the microwave. They are about 100 times better than the trendy junk I owned prior to this that cost as much. The feel is great and quality is very high. This is a good deal and a good reason to get rid of your old plates.*UPDATE 05/07/08*This dish set has yet to show much wear. I am still very happy with them, although the price has increased about 300% since I bought them."
4,Great Set of Blue Willow,I got this set of Blue Willow China for Christmas and have been very pleased so far. It is of excellent quality and has done fine in both the dishwasher and microwave. It is true that some of the pieces are a little lighter than others but isn't noticable enough to bother me. I would definitely say this is a set worth owning.
4,Very Nice,"This set is very nice, but the color on some items is much lighter then on others, that makes it look old."
2,It's a lie!,"It isn't that it is ugly. But it is a lie...a huge lie Amazon is telling you, the set is made in MALAYSIA. Yep... by Wessex. It isn't even Churchill. And China? I'd call it stoneware! Buyer BEWARE!"
3,Possessed mirror terrorizes art commune.,"A struggling artist receives a mirror from one of his subjects.... After reading the title can you guess where it all happened? This haunted mirror thriller has some interesting moments (most revolving around said mirror's effects on the other struggling artists living with, or next door, to the lead character) and does a pretty respectable job building suspense towards the end, which makes it one of the better Amityville films out there. Still that isn't saying much considering their overall quality. Worth a look."
3,"It has an extremely stupid plot, but it's very fun","The plot for AMITYVILLE: A NEW GENERATION is probably something a 7-year-old kid could think of on a boring, rainy day. A haunted mirror? No way! It's very silly but sooooo fun! I honestly do not have the slightest idea where the ideas for these AMITYVILLE sequels come from! But, it's fun, gory and very cool. Check it if you liked the first film."
3,"Not scary, but entertaining for haunted house film fans","This is not based on a true story. A photographer gives money to a street man, and the street man gives the photographer a possessed mirror. The photographer lives with his girlfriend in an appartment in New york, and the romance turns deadly, because of the mirror."
2,I really do believe in the devil now,"God help us all if anyone thinks this movie comes close to the original Amityville Horror. This ""New Generation"" version is pretty bad. If I'm watching a horror movie and absolutely nothing comes along to make me feel scared, something is seriously wrong with it (keep in mind- I'm easily scared!) To say this movie is flawed isn't enough- it was just a really bad attempt to continue the series and falling flat because of lack of suspense. The storyline was okay, and all the actors were alright, but this is just a really bad low budget film. Avoid it now."
3,Mediocre!!,"Slow moving and none-to- creative, but almost every idea has already been tried in this series, so what do you expect?Actually, limited suspence and some good, creative scenes makes it tolerable and you may want to try to sit and enjoy it."
3,OK,"Above average low budget film about a mirror that carries the `evil'. An old mirror that used to be inside the original Amityville house is given to an artist... by a beggar. Then all these weird accidents and mayhem begin. This story has a plot (somehow) and a twist, better acting than some of the other Amityville entries. First it was the lamp, then a dollhouse, then it's an old clock ... What's next? Can't they think of anything better!"
3,Not made very good.,"I wouldn't call my daughter destructive, but she ripped the door off the Fridge NUMEROUS times. It clicks back into place, but you'd think it would be made a little bit better. it's just annoying to have to fix it all the time. I got it for her when she was 15 months old. I'm now Selling it on Ebay for this year since she never plays with it anyway, and when she does, it's just to tear the door off. :)"
2,Lauren's Mom,"My daughter recieved this toy when she was 5 months old. She primarly used it to pull herself up and tended to pick the entire kitchen up. It would have been helpful if it was slightly weighted on the bottom. Additionally, I was disappointed with the toaster. Either the toast should have been removable or it should have made sounds. She never became interested in the fridge door sorting but I am hoping that as her skills improve that it will become a fun game for her."
1,IT IS NOT $189.99-PLEASE CHECK FOR APPROPRIATE PRICE,"I don't own this toy -yet! But after seeing it in the store, I wanted to buy it for my 6 month old son. Today, I am looking at it on Amazon and am SHOCKED that they have it listed at $189.99, when it actually only should cost about $35. Please beware of this fact!"
2,not too impressed,"We gave this kitchen to my daughter at her 1st birthday. She is now well past her 2nd birthday and has yet to play much with this toy. It just doesn't do that much. There are 3 food shapes to put in the sorter, a couple doors to open and a few burners that make sounds. My daughter plays with it for about one minute and then moves on. My advice is: if you want a shape sorter type toy, buy a much smaller one with more spaces (like the classic tupperware one with 10 shapes, my daughter loves that one), and if you want a kitchen for you child, just break down and buy a big play kitchen. Your child can play with that for years and years."
4,Great lil Toy..IF it worked right,My sister in law bought this toy for my one year old daughter for christmas and she really loves playing with it...but within a couple days I noticed that it wasn't working right..the sink wasn't lighting up or making sounds and the stove top makes the sounds that the sink is supposed to make I replaced the batteries even though I didn't think that was the problem and sure enough it wasn't so there must be a wire crossed somewhere...even with the kitchen not fully functioning my daughter still really enjoys playing with this toy we bought the accessories that go with the kitchen because we were a little disappointed with what it came with but overall it is probably in her top three favorite toys...I haven't had much luck with exchanging it or with little tikes sending a new one but I would still ask for this toy again for my daughter or buy it myself
2,Kind of a disappointment,"I expected this toy to have a little more to it. Yeah, the burner and ""sink"" parts make a noise and light up a little, but the toast doesn't come out of the toaster and the food accessories are pretty boring. That said, my 1 and 4 year-olds both play with it some. I was hoping for a little more action to distract them while I cook in the actual kitchen. Also, the door to the refrigerator falls off easily (and goes back on pretty easily, too)."
3,"Initially delighted, but now disappointed!","I bought this kitchen set for my daughter's first birthday. She immediately loved it and played with it longer than any other toy she's ever had. However, it took her one day to realize that the door of the refrigerator comes off, and now she takes that off when she begins to play with it. She gets frustrated that she cannot put it back on. Why did they have to make the door this way?!?!?! Still, she likes the shape sorter and the sounds."
4,60min of relief,discover sounds kitchen has occupied my 18 mo old neice for atleast 60min of uniterrupted non stop fun.I love it as much a she does.
4,Good for younger kids,"While my 2 1/2 year old loves playing with pretend food and cooking, this kitchen set is now too short for her, so she no longer plays with it. When she ""cooks"" she needs to walk around to serve others, and therefore, she prefers making her own ""kitchen"" on couches and chairs. We have a larger kitchen set outside which she really enjoys now.The size was perfect when she was younger (before she really knew what it was), and is great for my 9 month old baby. If you are looking at buying a kitchen, this is great for younger kids that are too short to reach the taller kitchen sets, but as they get taller, a larger kitchen set would probably be played with more often. Of course, with their great imaginination, pretend food and pots and pans seem to do the trick well without any kitchen."
3,Good toy for a little while,"My 17 month old enjoys playing with this kitchen, mimicking Mommy. However, in the past few months she has REALLY shown an interest in kitchen playsets for 2+ that are for the child to stand at while using. She doesn't go to this kitchen as often as she used to. For her, this toy seemed to be at it's prime for about 3 months (12-15 months of age) and now she has moved on to the next level of play. It is a cute toy that introduces toddlers to kitchen ""ideas"", but it either needs more intrigue or a younger age to start. I think that when she was 9 months old or even just sitting up she would have had fun playing with parts of it-opening the refrigerator/microwave/or oven, hitting the stove to make the music play or turning the ""water"" in the sink to make the music play. She may have had more trouble with the shape sorter then, but I think toys are good to grow into. I do not recommend this as a 12-month toy. Wait a few months and buy one for 2+."
2,Waste of money,"We bought this toy for my daughter last year for Christmas(she was 15 months), I thought it would be great for her to play with but when we took it out of the box and saw how small it was I was really disappointed. It really isn't worth the money, she is now 2 years old and hardly ever plays with it, it is just too small to do anything with."
4,We're having so much fun!,"I got this toy for my daughter for her first birthday, which is actually not until next week, but I had to let her have it. I don't think she really understands that she is pretending to cook, but she loves the sounds it makes, and we all play with it together. She has such a good time making breakfast for her Mommy and Daddy! She cooked me an egg and Daddy some cheese just a little while ago. She is full of smiles! We are having a lot of fun with this toy. My only complaint is that the door on the refrigerator is a little bit too flimsy and I am afraid she is going to break it off. Hopefully this will not happen!"
4,Nice Kitchen if Space is an Issue,"My daughter has had this kitchen set for a few months now. She's almost two and plays with it more now that she's older and into pretend play and imitating mommy. She really likes the full sized play kitchens, but we don't have space for that so she makes due with this set for now. I'm not sure how long it's going to last though because there isn't any room for additional play food and accessories. Hopefully we'll get a year out of it before needing to upgrade. If you're seaching for an activity toy and are unsure what to get, I would recommend the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Home over the Discovery Sounds Kitchen. It's an extra $30 but it's bigger, has lots more activities and appeals to a wider age group."
2,Consider something else...,"We received this kitchen for our 1-year old's birthday. She barely takes notice of it! Although the sounds were initially thrilling to hear, they have since lost their appeal. It is so tiny (barely 16 inches high) that she must sit to enjoy anything about it. Also, it is lightweight... so, don't be surprised when you see it knocked over or dragged off into another area.The real treasure about this kitchen are the tiny shapes, pots, & utensils that come with it. It's just unfortunate to spend so much on accessories!Choose this toy wisely. It is for such a limited time that a child will be interested in it!"
1,nay to that,"truely, it isn't good. simplistic and tedious. for good stuff tune into Roni Size and Dara."
2,Not quite.,"AK1200 has talent. He really does. It just doesn't really show on this disc. It starts out as an old-skool hip-hop D&B; jumble. I'm all for hip-hop, but his track selection is pretty weak. Considering the some of the big names that were on the tracks, it should have been better. AK demonstrates some pretty basic scratching here as well, but let's face it, the man is no turntableist. I REALLY hate female vocals in D&B;, and there are more than enough to turn my stomach in the first couple tracks.Towards the middle of the mix, the tone shifts a little closer to harder jungle. By the end of the CD it is full on AK jungle, although at times it sounds a little closer to Dieselboy.Overall, if you like hip-hop, chances are you will enjoy the first few tracks. If not, suffer through them and you will eventually hear some pretty good D&B;, but it ain't anything special."
5,A gripping you-are-there account. Riveting!!,"It's uncanny how well Chiaventone blends fact (much of which has never appeared in novel form) with well informed speculation. The comparison to ""The Killer Angels"" is especially apropos, in that the reader is immersed in a riveting you-are-there approach to events which we have come to take for granted as a familiar part of our heritage. But the detail and realism shaped by Chiaventone's descriptive power is decidedly unnerving as these men - native and invader - are gripped in their death struggle. One feels as if they might still be there in the dust and the heat on that hill..."
4,Works Great,"This worked on my Coleman duel fuel stove (Amazon Item model number: 3000000788)It appears to be of good construction, however, I gave it 4 stars because 1: it doesn't regulate the flame very well you can adjust it but not down to a simmer or anything close to that 2: the control knob seems wobbly and cheap 3: I had to use an engraver to etch numbers on the knob to tell what it was on (off, low, medium etc) I think overall it had 6 settings 4: The spring does not work to hold the thing to the stove frame you really need to look at the picture that someone posted showing how to make a wire bracket for it.But overall it's worth the money and I can deal with a few gripes because it does work and is a really inexpensive way to convert your stove."
2,Low flame is not possible,"This converter works in the sense that it will let you use propane in your Coleman white gas stove, but it does have a critical flaw. There are only four preset knob positions: high, higher, full blast, and flamethrower. Fine for boiling a large pot of water but useless for simmering, frying an egg, or any other cooking that requires a low flame.After buying this converter (which I now keep as a backup), I also bought theStansport Propane Converter, which does allow you to finely adjust the flame to any level. (See my review of that product on Amazon.)Both converters are of equal build quality as far as I can tell. The knob on the Stansport could be a little beefier, but it gets the job done."
4,Century Regulated Propane Converter (Grey),"Using this on an old 1968 green colemand stove. Only complaint was that you need to put something under it outside the stove so it doesn't hang. When hanging without support, it has an angle going into the burners and may not seat very well. Other wise works great and no more white gas to worry about."
4,propane converter for coleman stoves,"the converter allows using propane with coleman type camp stoves. it works fine, but would benefit by having a continuously variable adjustment instead of four preset settings. I have an older three burner stove and could not turn it down enough to simmer on the center, hotter, burner. Had to leave the center burner on and use one of the outer burners. Other than that it works fine.I do recommend it to others."
4,Great Product For An Old Stove,"This simple device works great for converting an old kerosene stove into one that burns propane. This is the second one I've purchased. A lesson learned, don't leave a propane tank connected for an extended period of time. The threads will corrode. That's why I had to buy a second one."
1,wow,"Seriously, that sumed up this whole series. I was hoping it would be good considering it was made from studio bones ( makers of darker than black. . . Best anime ever) but it was not to be. Seriously I can watch any anime Evan if I don't like it but after 2 episodes I quit. This series tries soon hard to be like gurren lagann, but fails in epic proportions. The animetion is exceptional but the characters were so nauseating I would rather watch soul eater agien. And no its not Evan that watchable. Watch it online before you buy it. That is a lesson I just learned via wasting 40.00$"
5,How to be Cause and Not Effect in your life.,"Dr. Wolf has done a wonderful thing in giving us his gift of MIND INTO MATTER. He reminds us, dares us, to go into the future, and using our sense of imagination, to CREATE our destiny. To BE the 'dreamer of the dream.' How The Universe Works would have been a great title too! This book is as close as science is ever going to get to the MYSTERY of creation. Dr. Wolf describes how one goes about 'Asking', in order that 'Ye Shall Receive' manifests. Stated quite frankly and to the point Fred shows you HOW TO MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE! Gadzooks doesn't even begin to describe how wonderful this work is. Thanks Dr. Wolf, now get on with the next one, I can't wait."
3,Might appreciate it more later,"I found the book to be rather difficult to follow through the first few chapters. The middle and end of the book were easier to understand; however, there could have been more examples to clarify some of the rather complex concepts. I have recently purchased another book along the same subject line and it presents the material a little more clearly. I may reread this book later or at least compare Wolf's explanations of quantum physics to those in the other book for clarification. I don't have a physics background (except in high school), so that may have been the problem too."
1,Huh?,Wolf may understand his subject but I certainly can't with his garbled explanations of it. It just seemed to trip all over itself and did not clarify anything for me.
2,Wrong playlist,"I ordered this cd for an emergency situation. Friend in car accident and found this in his car as a favorite cd. Was ruined. Wanted to play it in the hospital. Now he has passed away but the cd I received is the wrong one! You advertise the correct cover but the playlist is wrong. You sent Dancing in the Dark Songs that won the War, not Romantic Memories of the War Years. Too late to fix. I used a song for the funeral video, but unfortunately not the songs I wanted to play for his final day. What a mess up. It wasn't about the money. It was about the memories."
5,Best on the Holy Land I've ever seen!,"""My compliments to the creators of this beautiful book. It is the best book on the Holy Land that I have ever seen. I just ordered 100 copies for sale in our gift shop."" -Brother Christopher, Buyer, Franciscan Monastery Gift Shop, Washington D.C.."
5,Prolix Reviewers,"Other reviewers seem chagrined they didn't write of Archie as did Marvin Kaye, or indeed as Rex Stout originally did of Wolfe himself. This is an understandable, even sympathetic, regret. But not one to justify prolixity.To those who have dwelt--- still dwell--- happily in the egocentric world of Wolfe and Archie, Mr. Kaye's essay will be a pleasurable spin of that globe. To others, the unbereft, it will not."
2,Amateurish,"I was disappointed by this book and think that other reviewers have been extremely kind in their assessment. As sweet as the plot is, the writing is amateurish. I just don't think it's all that well-written. It's nowhere near as good as Frankie Jones, Marianne Martin or Karin Kallmaker. Those women know how to craft good sentences, good paragraphs, well-directed chapters and overall intriguing plots. I' d have to know that McCann had actually gotten better (and there's some good advice from Litterati1 that she should heed) before I bought her next book."
3,Made me break out,"I've worn silver jewelry for years with no problem, but within days of putting this necklace on, I broke out in a blistery rash all around my neck. It makes me wonder if it is really sterling silver.The necklace is nice looking, but I can't wear it."
5,Ordered for my daughter,"This recorder was ordered for my eleven year old daughter for Christmas. She plays the flute in the school band. I didn't want to sink a lot of money into another instrument but wanted one with a decent enough sound she could continue to practice her music and play around with. This little instrument is very pretty and feels sturdy. You can get a nice tone out of it as well. For someone who would like to try learning music and playing a wind instrument without sinking a pile of cash into it, this would probably be a good starter instrument. It's better quality than a ""toy"" or the kind we played in grade school, but yet still inexpensive. It comes with its on canvas type zippered case containing a cleaning rod, joint grease and end caps for the three pieces of the instrument. I'm very pleased with this purchase and it has given hours of fun to my child. I gave it five stars because it's exactly what I was looking for."
4,nice instrument--but very hard on small hands,"After re-discovering my old elementary school recorder a few weeks ago, I have been trying to re-teach myself to play, and decided that I wanted a better, deeper toned recorder. I bought this one because it was one of the best-reviewed alto ones available, and at under $20, it was a pretty reasonable impulse buy. I did read in some of the user reviews that the wider spacing of the holes made it much harder to smaller hands, but was willing to risk $20 bucks on the chance that it might work for me.This recorder has a very nice deep tone, and the carrying case and equipment is very nice, but unfortunately, as I'm a rather small woman, I'm one of the unlucky people whose hands are too small to comfortably play this recorder (my finger span is 7"" fully extended). Still, I don't regret purchasing it, since even if I do end up buying another (smaller) recorder, I wouldn't have spent much more money overall than if I had purchased just one at a music store."
5,Was not expecting this high quality,I was looking for an easy to play instrument I could learn while recovering from surgery. I bought this thinking that it'd be something fun to fiddle with for a few weeks but this has turned into one of my favorite instruments.Fantastic quality! It comes with a fingering chart but I recommend just getting one offline on one of the many free sites. Comes in a lovely carrying case that's easy to slip in a purse or bookbag. Highly recommended!
5,The best movie in a long time,"When I saw this movie, It was so funny. This is the only movie that I actually almost cried in. The ending is really sad. I would see this movie over and over again."
5,Astounding...,"My wife read the book as a teen, and bought the movie recently. She didn't tell me anything about it before we watched it; and I can't for the life of me remember being more emotionally moved by a movie. Clearly the ending is sad, but I was impressed with the depth of the relationship and the way this film addressed the sincere love between a husband and wife that truly love each other and get the eternal nature of marriage. I couldn't recommend this more strongly for married couples."
4,"A heartwarming, tearjerking tale of humainty","This is one film that gets me every time. Still, I do appreciate the story of hope that it shares. That death is not the end, even if it is tough to be away from those we love. Sure it's fiction, but the message is real."
3,Combined collection of science papers,"After all this book seems to be just a combination of the science papers of Steve Mann. Those papers are great no offense but i had expected the book to be a bit more ""readable"". It has some additional content compared to the plain papers so its not senseless to buy it, if you have the money for it.In my version there is an error on page 237 where the projective model is placed under the ""non-chirping models"" which is not correct. I think for a book THAT expensive errors such as this should not happen."
1,This book is the WORST book I have read in years...,"Well, Before reading my comments take a look at the book itself....mannnn, this book sucked. Badly sucked. I just don't know what you were talking about...I hate to say this, but I have no idea how you wrote this....--steve"
2,Picture Misleading,"The directional switch is a high quality original equipment part. The illustration however is very misleading. I needed the entire control panel as it is depicted in picture including the the speed rheostat and on/off switch. This product is for ONLY the pan & tilt switch. There was nothing wrong with the product I received, however the as listing needs to be significantly improved to make it very clear what you are buying."
4,Enjoyable read,"Nice story, some suspense, not much surprise. I loved Calla's personality. Henry was the typical, perfect romance novel hero. There was only one sex scene, I would have preferred more. I did not like what Henry gave to Frank at the end, sounded too risky to me. Otherwise I liked it. Sexual content: moderate."
5,knocks it out of the park!,"Calla meets Henry when he gallantly helps her out with a flat tire, and when he shows up at the ranch she manages, she hires him for the summer. But (you knew there was a 'but' somewhere) she's got a boyfriend, a complete toad called Clark so she tries to ignore her attraction to Henry. As if. This is a funny, sexy story with good minor characters. A good first book by Ms. King."
4,MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST!!!!,"I purchased this book with the first book ACTIVITIES THAT TEACH. This book was 100x better than the first. This book had easier activities that I felt my students would be capable of benefiting from. I still do not think this series is beneficial for any classroom other than a traditional high school 11th and 12th grades. The activities are very intense, sometimes complicated, and not always applicable to the current day and age. I found much more success with the book LIFE SKILLS by SANDRA MCTAVISH."
5,"new stuff ,but rocks !","With guys from riot,b.o.c,and rainbow you would wonder.But this is welldone.Does'nt kick but there are some seriously great guitar playinggoing on here as well as melodic.This certain to make you content if youwere thinking of buying this-It's worth it."
4,Very good theories.,"This book will make any film person think about what they see or hear. It helps put some quantified rules on visual expression and I think they are some of the very basic rules. The author admits that a lot of these rules aren't definite, but they they are the standard. I don't regret purchasing this book."
1,underwhelming,"Bruce Block opens his book by claiming that he is drawing upon the teachings of Eisenstein. He isn't. The vast majority of the book is given to analyzing the ""hidden lines"" within images. Unfortunately, there is a catch. The hidden visual structure within an image may have some kind of resonance - I'm not really sure, but it seems to me to be sister to the kind of ""the work of Virginia Wolf analyzed in meta-postmodern-structuralism,"" analysis that obscures, rather than illuminating, the essential elements that make a given work of art/lit/film succeed.Film is made of story, sound, image, and cut - I suppose that it isn't Block's fault that he chooses to focus on overanalyzing just one of those categories, but I do wish that the film school grad who recommended that I read this book had not.Refund."
5,Former Student,Having taken Bruce Block's visual expression class while getting my MFA at USC Film School I highly recommend this book. It's one of the few classes I took in film school that has had any lasting value. It should be part of any filmmakers foundation.
2,Whiney Cover Songs,"Nothing too original here...even the CONCEPT isn't original (see Vagrant's 1997 release of 'Before You Were Punk').Lot's of whiney/nasaly vocals are laid down on top of sped up cover songs peppered with a few trendy production techniques.If you're going to cover a song, shouldn't you add something to it?Annoying album."
3,hit or miss,"the midtown cover of the outfield's ""your love"" is really fun, and jamisonparker does a good job in his rendition of tears for fears's ""everybody wants to rule the world"". the rest of the album you can take or leave."
5,BEST. CD. EVER.,"it is bad that i can't stop listening to this cd? its addicting. majorly. and i'm in love with it. so everyone should buy it. the best is ""forever young"". i have it on repeat right now. its that good."
4,Ballymaloe Cookbook,This cookbook is great and contains a plethora of easy to follow recipes from appetizers to desserts. A must-have for your kitchen library.
3,Do not wear,"I got this ring at Disney World and its an amazingly cheap replica. I got a size 12 and it fits great. The only problem is that since it's cheap, it's not made for everyday wear. The ring tarnished really quick and lost color and discolors your finger. So, I retired it to the collection. I'm a huge Pirates fan but I can only recommend anyone to buy this only to collect it."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible.","Videodrone are a softer man's Orgy. And I don't like Orgy.I'm not saying these guys don't have talent, they do...its just that I DO NOT LIKE this cd. I have always considered myself to a fan of a lot of music...but this one was just horrible.You might like them, I don't know..but I sure didn't."
2,Bakersfield Scene,"Here we go again, looking at the small community Korn came from. After hearing ""Ty Jonathan Down"", I first heard about this band. The song really is good!But when then listeing to the rest of the album, I was very dissapointed. The songs just don't have 'it'. The style changes from song to song.Fred Durst (oh no!!!!) and some Korn guitars are featured in this album.....but they don't really help anything in making this album something special.In the end, this album is not worth buying."
4,Almost perfect,A would be classic album tarnishedwith bad guests excluding only jon davis.videodrone are just like the Movie they were named afteroriginal and innovative
4,Whoa! What The F@#ck was that!,"That's exactly what I felt like saying after I listened to this CD! This is one weird trip, I can't even begin to describe their style! All I know is, don't let the Korn-esque opening track, ""Ty Jonathan Down"" (which actually features Korn's amazing vocalist Jonathan Davis) or the Beatle-esque ""Faceplant"" fool you. Videodrone are neither a hiphop-inflicted new-school metal band (although Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst does appear on one track, as do Psycho Relm), nor are they anything resembling a conventional pop band (although singer Ty can definitly carry a tune, sounding something like a cross between Radiohead's Thom York, U2's Bono, and the late John Lennon). The closest I can do to giving a label for their sound is Twisted Electro-Pop Metal, but that doesn't cover half of it!"
2,Nothing new here,"I saw these guys when they opened up for Rob Zombie/KoRn...and I must say, I had never been in a completely dead mosh pit until these guys came on. Boring and annoying...the only time it sounded good was when Fieldy came out and sang with em..."
1,I just bought this crap for one golden song!,"Yeah, I can recall this one time when I was 14 years old, and I was in the kitchen and had the radio on. A song came on the radio from a band called videodrone and this song faceplant plays, I fell in love with the song. After hearing it about three more times, I never heard the song ever again. The band never blew up and just kinda dissapeared as quick as they appeared out of nowhere. Anyways I never forgot how good that song made me feel, and I never heard that song ever again. Fast forward 2009 (ten years later), I discovered it on amazon, read all the bad reviews of the album, bought it anyways.. The album sucks ass, but that song is always going to be a late 90's classic! Thank God I finally found the song again!!!"
1,I'm so glad they broke up,"Put this cd on your list of ""cd's not to buy."" This is pure crap at its finest, these guys have no talent at all. Their music sucks, it's so boring you will either want to break your stereo to pieces (please don't, this cd is definitely not worth the hassle) or just break the cd to pieces (which I highly recommend). Videodrone is by far one of the worst bands out there, and I am so happy that they broke up. I hope that they never get back together and I hope that they never bring their crappy ""talent"" into another band and ruin that band's career as well. But there's a light that is showing through all of this, and that is this: If Videodrone can make it into the music business, anyone can."
5,pretty dope!,"Videodrone iz pretty fly. i saw them open for KoRn and they were cool. this CD iz really creative and haz some dope songs like Ty Jonathan Down. i wuz a little disappointed because they aren't as hard as KoRn, but still a good CD. BUY IT!"
5,Videodrone,"I saw Videodrone in concert with Korn and Rob Zombie. They put on an awesome opening performance. Towards the end of the show, I was walking around the arena, and I ran into Ty Elam (singer for Videodrone). I asked him for his autograph, and he was so nice and cool about it. So, he signed his name all over my arm!!!!!!!!!! I recommend this band, they are the next big thing!"
4,it was a strong ful hearted book,"I believe that this book is wonderful, the way it shows her feelings, and also how the pain blacks felt against white people. I hope to read more of Maya's books in the future."
3,You'll like part two of this autobiography,"Although each of us undergoes different experiences in our lifetimes, by reading this book you will understand that despite these differences, humans undergo very similar emotions. This book provides a wonderfuol sequel to I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings -- a journey into the human spirit of an incredible woman."
4,Internet can be friendly,"To achieve co-ordination of diverse personalities, from the four corners of the world, and pour their talent into a book...well this is in itself a project worth taking notice.People should buy this book for the sake of proving that technology can be warm and friendly, considering that the authors are all cyber-friends."
2,"A Different, Yet Difficult Read...","One of the greatest aspects of the book is its length. I don't mean that to sound sarcastic, but the plot is so weighted by metaphors, symbolism and inuendos that if it were any longer, I for one would have chosen to abandon it. In addition, the first half of the book, the word ""sex"" is used so often and metaphorically, that it only makes her message even more complex, when it shouldn't be. Once I got used to her style of writing, I did discover a decent story, I just wished I didn't have to work so hard to uncover it."
2,a drink called paradise,"i have been to this part of the world recently and felt it offered a lot for a novel. the story line, such as it is, had a lot of potential. other reviews warned about the preoccupation with sex. apparently the author is either obsessed to the exclusion of everything else or thinks that just mentioning sex every other page, without any subtlety or romance, sells. the stream of consciousness style works some of the time, but., most of the time simply does not flow and jerks along incoherently. the characters are not dimensional. it could have been a good book...if someone else would have written it."
4,Solid,"Because of the presence of the members of Traffic it is easy to say that this sounds like Traffic. It doesn't. Traffic, started out very tight, very song oriented, particularly at the point they made this album.This is essentially a loose folk jazz rock album ala Tim Buckley without the passion and vocal firepower of Tim Buckley.It is a very nice languid album, that works great in the background, but never catches fire."
3,An experts view,"I used to make marble runs as a child and years later am an engineer. This review is really for the manufacturer not the normal consumer. PLEASE manufacture the marble tracts as deep as the marbles and make EVERY piece include an incline. You have the potential for a great product here but you will drive the children nuts in the fact that they are limited with the combinations they can create. The small pieces should work exactly like the long sections and include an incline. A marble should never STOP moving on a piece. If the groves were as deep as the marbles, the number of possible arrangements would increase exponentially. I know the thought was that the short sections would work as shoots but that is not the way a child's mind works."
3,"Fun to play with, frustrating","The quality of this product is perhaps not as high as one would hope, however our children love (watching us set it up). It is a little hard for a kid to figure out how to play with, or an adult for that matter, because the chosen sizes for the blocks are a little unusual.However, despite this you can make hundreds of interesting permutations and it is quite fun to play with."
3,Average Effort,"This is not Tevin's best, but it is an effort. It is not what I am used to hearing. I think he was too relaxed on this joint. But nevertheless, there are some favorites on here. I enjoyed ""My Love Aint Blind"", The only One for me and Dandelion.If you are a Die Hard Fan, purchase this. One Love."
2,MISSING SOMETHING.,"I bought this CD KNOWING I couldn't go wrong. But, I have a funny feeling I did. Tevin has seemed to ""grow up."" But, it seems to make him more boring. I remembered how he could really ""belt out"" a tune and take a song to another level. Here, he seems to just ""go along"" with the material."
4,TEVIN HAS GROWN UP,"I HAVE FOLLOWED HIS CAREER SINCE HIS DEBUT ON QUINCY JONES BACK ON THE BLOCK ALBUM.. EACH CD..HIS NEW ONE SHOWED JUST HOW FAR HE HAS CAME AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE PREMIRE R&B SINGERS AROUND TODAY.. GONE IS THE LIL CUTE PUPPLY LOVE SONGS NOW THE SONGS ARE ABOUT COMMITTMENT, LOVE LOST, .. IN A DAY OF HEARING DO ME THIS WAY .. DO ME THAT WAY.. IT IS REFRESHING TO HEAR SONGS MORE BOUT LOVE THEN ONE NIGHT STANDS .. OR SOME ONE CHEATINGSTAND OUT CUTS THE ONLY ONE FOR ME, ANOTHER WAY, FOR YOUR LOVE,SIEMPRE ESTARAS EN ML"
2,A so-so effort...,"Now don't get me wrong...I LOVE Tevin Campbell. However, I do not love this album. Tevin seems to be holding back; on any of his earlier works one can hear him really belt the song out and thus, pull you in. His vocals are much more reserved and...well...it's just not Tevin at his best. Listen to ""I'm Ready"" or ""Back to the World"" for pure Campbell."
3,expected more,"i was really disappointed with this album. this may have been bought upon by the fact that i kept comparing it to i'm ready, which was undisputedly his best work! i really expected more and tevin sure fell short."
5,FANTASTIC!,This Cd of Tevin Campbell is a fantastic work! I love every singel song because he puts so much soul in it!
4,I love the lyrics. A well written CD.,"I'd say that this CD is a great buy. Tevin sounds fabulous. He is a truely talented young man. He doesn't holler and scream at you, he actually sings. 'Dandelion' is the most romantic song I've heard this year. It's so beautiful and passionate. I wish someone would write something as lovely as that about me!!! Tevin, if you need a girl to play 'Dandelion' in the video, look me up!!! I'm definitely your girl. Kudos, for a very mature and romantic CD."
2,A headache on tape,"While the information in this product (tape version) is valuable, the speaker's delivery is very hard to listen to. After awhile it feels just like a headache on tape. Energy is great, but overkill isn't. Buy the book version. The basic message is this: you don't have to ACT the way you feel. You can feel whatever emotions you feel, but then choose how to act. That's the key to emotional control."
1,A Must to Avoid,"This is a comic book version of a historic battle. The author presents a disjointed attempt that deals in fragments of events that are poorly connected. A useful map would certainly aid the reader who tries to follow the reading. On one page is a very lengthy footnote which actually appears 2 pages later as part of the text. Actually, I found the footnotes and their sources more valuable than the stumbling sequence of events as presented by the author. There must be a better book available."
4,GREAT PERFORMANCE (4 1/2 STARS),"I give this DVD 4 1/2 stars, and reason i don't think is a 5 is the live footage, all the work with camera angles and stuff could be better,this also includes the image resolution. The audio mix, it's not bad at all but no other choice than the default audio of the performance (good mix though).Now, the performance of the band is amazing, pure top class DEATH METAL, very talented and passionate musicians, and one of the reasons that made this tour possible was the incorporation (with short notice)of drummer Reno Kiilerich who proved to be guy for the job!The extra material is cool, nice interview, videos and behind the scenes at Rutan's MANA studios.Go buy it, and enjoy."
5,Their older stuff is just as good!,"I've been a fan of Locksley for about 4 years now, but I had never owned this album because I couldn't find it anywhere! I recently purchased it on Amazon and I couldn't be happier that I did. Their older stuff is definitely just as good as their newer self-titled album and upon hearing it for the first time, I immediately had favorites like the Past and the Present and Safely From the City. If you like their album Be In Love or their self-titled album, I would strongly recommend getting Don't Make Me Wait as well!"
5,Go Russell!,"I had the honor of listening to this C.D. at my cousin's house (Russell Gunn) and I fell in love with it then! I would advise all real jazz lovers to have this one in your C.D. collection. If you don't, you are not true to the game!"
3,Pretty Good,"i heard alot about this guy playing JAzz&Hip-Hop so i had to hear.having already been thru this already with Guru,BuckShot LEfonque,&Us3 i was curious.well it has some strong moments but it misses in some spots as well.His tone is good but some of the grooves don't work.but yet overall it's a pretty good disc and i await his next disc cuz i think he has Talent."
3,Great Book. TONS of Errors on Disk,"The book is great for learning to actually apply finance principles. In that it is awesome, useful and unique. I recommend it for sure.But the accompanying disk with the ""answers"" to the exercises is so wrought with errors as to be useless to someone who isn't handy enough with Excel to spot them. I'd say 30% or more have errors... I drove myself crazy at first trying to figure out why thngs weren't balancing until I realized there were glaring errors in the example sheets. Also, many of the inital values don't match the ones in the book. Really careless treatment of what is probably the most important feature of the book which is the application exercises. That part is very disappointing.Buy it, but be aware of this."
5,An Extremely Informative Book,I have rarely come across a text that explains the complex financial concepts so well. The hands-on learning that the book encourages makes it unique. The best part is that you do not need to be a finance or a commerce person to understand those concepts. This book is throughly recommended to those starting out with finance as well as experienced professionals.
5,Excellent book for reference and simplifying crucial concepts,"I bought this book to help me prepare for an investment banking position that I got offered just out of college. I have not completed the book yet, but so far it is an excellent guide to designing models and cases in finance using excel, which not a lot of textbooks in school today touch on. I had a class which specialized in only excel in finance but I know that this isn't the case in all schools and there was no textbook to use in conjunction with the class either. I would highly recommend this book to a lot of people in the finance industry."
3,"Great book, many errors","This is really a great book. It's written in a way that's easy to understand, it does a good job of relating Excel to the financial topics, and the cd that comes with it is nice; seeing as it has all of the spreadsheets discussed in the book and answers / templates to the problem sets.One big problem with it though, (and let me stress the BIG) is that there are way too many errors in it. While the errors in the actual book are few; there are many errors in the answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. This has become very frustrating to me since I'm basically learning from the book on my own and don't really have anyone to help when an error in a problem's answer stops me from fully understanding it.Bottom line this is a great book and if you have a good teacher to help you along then there shouldn't be too many problems. I would definitely give it a 5 if it wasn't for all the errors on the CD."
5,Another Masterpiece from Doctor Benninga,This book is by far the best book for introducing students to Finance and Excel. Doctor Benninga is in my opinion one of the best authors out there and he has again gracefully managed to publish a book that will become a classic just like his previous work Financial Modeling. I've had the opportunity to teach some classes of corporate finance and this book is an excellent introductory into the field of finance and the use of excel. In this book the student is able to learn everything from simple calculations of present value all the way up to valuing options. I fully recommend this book to anyone seeking to learn about finance or excel applied to finance. A most have definitely!
5,yes five star-break the record for this album,"This is certainly a great musical work- in all aspects- musical arrangement, epical., rhapsodic, melodic, powerful, symphonic and never tiring-It really has it all- starting with main title- March of Mephisto. real strong and spine chilling- transports me back to the past somehow! (As I love epic metal and celtic traditional music I make my personal associations of both) that marching sound- really dominaiting. Great - not to mention Khan's powerful and versatile voice. Abandoned is another theme I Iike- really beautifully sad. --- This album exceeds Epica- that means progress. Wish they could play live in Portugal--It sounds unprobable, but anyway we never know!"
1,Not A Master Piece,"I don't know what I was thinking,this is a horriable album.The singer Khan has a bad voice.This album is slow and boring.March Of Mephisto has the Dimmu Borgir singer on it(awful).There is nothing good about this album,it's annoying."
5,"Better, darker than Epica!","This album is awesome! The songs are excellent, especially the epic 'Memento Mori'. Khan's vocals on the ballad 'Abandoned' are heartbreaking. I even liked Shagrath's growls on 'March of Mephisto', they completely fit the song. Simone Simons (of Epica, the band) vocals are beautiful on 'The Haunting'. It's hard to pick a favorite, because they're all so good! The production is perfect, and each different layer (i.e. guitars, vocals, orchestra, drums) melds together effortlessly. For those who wonder, this album does not sound like Epica part 2. The Black Halo has a much darker, more mature feel to it, with so many nuances that one could get lost for hours in the music. Kamelot has created a masterpiece, and I bow down to them for it."
1,Do not order this item if you want what is described,They shipped the Phosphorescent version of this compass even though they list the Tritum version here and will keep your shipping charges and make you pay the return freight. The vendor has been notified several weeks ago and has not corrected the error. Avoid this item and find a better vendor.
2,Not Tritium Keep Looking,"I received my compass at the end of September 07. The compass is phosphorescent, not tritium. I will be contacting them for return authorization number."
4,Indispensible reference materials!,"These two volumes represent the most up-to-date, complete, and academically critical presentations and translations of all the decrees of all 21 Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church.Of particular note is the original language text, given on the left-hand pages, providing the resources for the language scholar to make the translations him/herself. This is of value, because Fr. Tanner's English translation is a bit ""modern""; succumbing unnecessarily to the lure of the ""inclusive language translation"".Leaving this aside, the research and scholarship is impeccable. These volumes should be on the shelves of any clergyman or academic -- regardless of denominational affiliation."
5,This book is a keeper!,"""Amanda's Rib"" is fascinating. If you like mystery and suspense with romance thrown in, this is the book to read. I am not going to give details on the plot as there is enough infomation on it to pique the reader's interest and I don't want to give away anything, but I was constantly surprised and amazed by the different twists and turns in this book. The characters are depicted in great detail and the reader knows them intimately. The subject of domestic abuse is handled in a delicate manner, yet makes the reader aware of how violent the crime is, and how the victim is often powerless to leave the relationship. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. You'll find you can't put it down, but will hate to finish it. I can easily see this as a TV movie and I'm sure if this book got in the right hands, it would be on the best seller list, and/or maybe send this to Oprah's book club? I'm looking for more powerful writing from this talented author."
4,Interesting,Honestly I liked the book but I thought it would have been better if there was more conflict between Becky and kip
2,Sorry but the lady's voice sux,"Listening to the album i really loved songs like ""Best Friends"", and ""So many thing"" and some others but some songs reminded me of Jackson 5, as strange is it may seem. The lady's voice reminds me of Micheal Jackson's voice when he was a kid, u can hear that in ""What U gonna do""... If u like the voice alot i propose u buy the album cuz then u'll like it alot... BUT if u think the voice is bad... then buy something else.. don't waiste u'r money on this... buy Case or Tank"
2,Not For Me,"When I heard ""Caramel"" the first time, I thought City High could be a soul/R&B group I would enjoy. In all actuality, however, besides their catchy singles, City High has little to offer. From the start of the album right through to the very last track, it was pretty obvious this album simply wasn't in my bag of favorites.First off, I've never been a fan of the multi-gender band. (R&B and otherwise) While Claudette has a nice voice (not dissimilar from Beyonce of Destiny's Child's), the two guys seem to drag it down and I keep thinking of one of those obnoxious pop groups like Boyz N Girlz or S Club 7.If you like the singles, just copy them off the radio! This isn't worth the plastic and paper value (or space in your CD rack)."
3,"Not bad, but pretty mainstream at times","I expected more from this CD knowing that City High were protogees of Wyclef Jean and the comparisons made between the group and The Fugees. Rest assured, this group is not The Fugees. Yes, there are some great songs on the album. Of course there's the huge hit What Would You Do? I'm also a big fan of Wyclef and his songs are incredible, particularly 15 Will Get You 20. However, many of the songs just sound too much alike. They have great beats and interesting lyrics but the music itself isn't experimental and tends to blend together. Where's the talent displayed by Wyclef when melding R&B, hip-hop and raggae? Anyway, for a first effort it's not bad, but I was expecting more!"
4,Great Album!,"I'm going to be 100% honest here...I bought this album to hear more of Claudette's voice and that's it. In a Sea of Female artists, she stands out...enough to make me buy the album. My personal favorite is track 7- Caramel. Very well produced, great lyrics, great song. Next favorite... track 10- What would you do. This song I originally bought the CD for considering I was singing the chorus to and from work for 2 weeks... figured I might as well. Track 1 is my 3rd favorite... maybe cause it's like the other two? All in all, it's a great album, all the other songs are listenable, I'm just not that much of an R&B fan. This album comes a close second to Mya's ""Fear of Flying"" ( which could only be better if produced by Dr. Dre ). It's also a great tool for tuning sound systems. My two cents."
2,CD,"Don't waste your money and buy this cd because, there are only two good songs on the cd. And it's not worth it."
1,Get the singles,"I saw this in a bin at Wal-mart for 2.99 and decide to get it since was 2.99. Well, I want my money back. No wonder I only remembered two songs from them Carmel and What would you do. I would say get the singles to Carmel and call it a day. I never liked What Would You Do because it was contradicting...guy at bachelor party see friend who is a stripper and tries to give her advice. Wait..hello..you are were enjoying this lady removing clothes until you realized who it was.The rest of the CD is slow and boring. Claudette Ortiz has a great voice. She sort of sounds like Beyonce in songs 12 and 14 or vice versa. Save your time, energy, and money on this Cd and enjoy these when they are played on the radio."
3,Does anyone own this?,"I was on a website in 2001 and it was talking about which artists wouldn't be around in 2002. At the end of the list it said City High. Listen to this album and you'll understand why.City High consists of Robby Pardlo, Claudette Ortiz, and Ryan Toby. All three of them can sing, but the problem here is the material they have to work with. The subjects they dwell on are either topics that have been covered better many times before, or the lyrics are just dumb (""Why"" will make you say just that). And I almost fell asleep while listening to their cover of Donny Hathaway's ""Song For You"". Not even contributions by Andre Harris (""Sista"") and Vidal Davis (""Three Way"") can save this album.The only songs that really stand out are ""What Would You Do"" and ""Caramel"", and those aren't even the greatest songs in the world. But City High does have talent; they just have to learn how to use it better."
5,Definetly feelin' them!!!,"This freshmen CD for City High is probably the best CD for any freshmen group I have herd. I am a big fan of R&B/Soul music so this CD really does it for me! The beats are sometimes fast, slow, or just right. They have a different song for each situation/mood you are in. That is why this group is so diverse in this CD. Everything is just so right on it, SO JUST BUY THE THING! My favorite tracks are: 1,2,5,7,10,11.Peace, Stone"
5,City High Da Bomb,"This is one of the best CDs I own. 1. Didn't Ya-catchy chorus, great beat=9.0 2. Three Way-great chorus&beat=8.5 3. Why-great song&lyrics=9.0 4. Song For You-not one of the best songs=8.0 5.15 Will Get You 20-one of my favorites=9.5 6. Cat And Dogs-one of the best songs with Claudette rapping=10.00 7. Caramel-another great song, the remix wit Eve is even better=10.00 8.Best Friends-a good song, not one of the best=8.0 9. Sista-good song, good chorus=8.0 10. What Would You Do=another one of my favorites&one of the best=10.00 11. So Many Things-a good song-9.0 12. The Only One I Trust-one of my absolute faveorites, a lot of Claudette in this one,a great, moving song=10.00 13. City High Anthem-one of the best songs, has da best chorus=10.00 14. You Don't Know Me-one of my favorites=9.5"
1,Won't go low enough,"This Cd should get 0 stars. Quite simply this is the worst cd that I have ever heard in my life. The song ""What would you do"" is soooooooo annoying it is starting to make me want to rip the radio out of every car I hear it in. But there are still some good uses for the cd. You could use it as a coaster, as a frisbee, or better yet see what happens when you try to put together a girl who looks good and has no talent and two fake wannabe thugs. You know what happens you get the group called CITY HIGH."
3,Not Bad for a Debut Album,"City High did a great job on their debut album. The trio has a really original sound, and if they stick with it and stay together as a group, I won't be surprised if they continue to turn out hits. I was an immediate fan after their single ""What Would You Do"" came out, and after ""Caramel"" was released I was sold. The rest of the CD wasn't as good as the singles though, and if ""What Would You Do"" is what interested you, don't buy the entire CD."
2,After School Special Group,well hearing that Wycliff had this Group that He was working with&they had a Fugee type Vibe I checked into it&needless to say aside from the Subject Matter&Content it was like watching the old After School Shows.it's cool for a a few Minutes but after a while you are begging for a COmmercial&to be honest I ain't too fond of most Commercials TOday.Catchy&Cliched.nothing Musically stands out.so-so Vocals.basic Album for Basic Musical TImes.
1,"Agreed, bad remake","I think if you can find the Video edition you would be better off watching this movie on a VCR. I don't know what ancient equipment the DVD was transcribed thru but I can make better DVDs that this with home equipment. Early Ken Wahl. I'm a fan of his. Not a super movie but if you like Ken, it is worth watching."
5,Get over it.,"Im getting pretty tired of listening to all these people complain about the price. If its too exspensive for you then dont buy it and watch it online. Its not my problem you cant afford it. Besides dont you think its petty complaining this much over $30? I happily paid around 60 for the first season, then even more for season 2, and 3. Why? because I love bleach! If you do, then you'll get over the $30 price tag. OR you can continue to complain, but complain to yourself. People can decide for themselves if its too exspensive for them. The seasons not even out yet and people are giving bad reviews. The rating is for the season, not the price."
5,Best anime ever!!!!! behind Dragonball that is.,"This anime is incredible and goes deep into each characters life. This anime is second best on my list behind Dragonball Z. I wont go into the story because lets face it, only true fans will buy it at the increased price and true fans know the story anyways. What I can say to the people complaining about price is, will complaining on here help? Review this anime as a whole and complain to viz about price. This anime deserves 5 stars."
5,DONT BE SO PISSY,"Stop complaining about the packaging you get 12 episodes and that is 300 mins, you dont have to buy the dvd set you can watch it on youtube or pay $49 a month to watch 4 episodes of bleach each month so are you really getting ripped off?"
3,Too little for too much,"I love the bleach anime series but this is getting rediculous. I hate how they are giving less and less episodes per box for the same exact price. Im beginning to think of them as money grabbers and because people will pay for it they do it. Well, this is where I draw the line and stop buying it unless they start to give more episodes again.This is beginning to be a rip off. Waiting a year or two untill their all released and then expecting a re release of this in bigger sets for a cheaper price like I have seen with so many other animes such as Naruto sounds like a way better idea to me. Im going bankrupt here trying to keep up for so little amount of content. Id rather spend the same amount on complete series boxsets to other shows."
3,Hurry the hell up Viz,"I have to agree with some of the other posters here, but $30 isn't as bad as other placeswant it. Still the method they are releasing the series is a pain. I loved the season setsfor Bleach and wished it was released like it. On the other hand, they are taking forever tocatch up what has been shown on TV. They are like what passed the second filler arc by now? Don'tbother to really watch it on adult swim since it became crap.It'll take OVER 9000!!! years for them to release the series the way they are going. On to top itoff they don't even include the clean opening for the series. Just the clean endings. And if oneof the endings has an alternate take they don't even include those. Good example would be the thirdending theme from the second set.Even Naruto Shippuden is being released a lot quicker than Bleach. I like Bleach but damn they need tohurry the hell up so we can start getting to the good stuff."
2,"Love the series, disappointed with methods of release","The Bleach series continues. I have been buying the DVDs since they starting being released. It continues to be a series that's worth owning if you're an anime fan. However, the rate at which these are being released is starting to irritate me. They have also decided to give you anywhere from 12-14 episodes per set, which is seriously lacking in my opinion. They either need to lower the cost, or increase the amount of episodes per-set. I would give this a 5 stars if it weren't for the blatant money-grabbing tactics that's being exercised on this product."
4,A Wonderful Legacy,"The Ethical Will Kit is a unique and wonderful way to help me think through and develop a written legacy for my husband and sons. It is a simple idea, that of passing on our values to our family. But getting started is difficult. With the help of the examples in the kit and the clear and concise guidance it provides, it makes it so easy to do. I found the kit to be of great value to me as I write my ethical will and I am certain others will too. I wish this kit was available when my own parents were living -it would have been a wonderful way for them to leave loved ones with a written legacy of values that I know they lived, but would have been so much more precious had they written them down."
5,What you see is what you get,"This ""kit"" is exactly what it purports to be - a useful, easy to understand ""how to"" guide to preparing an ethical will. I have read many ethical wills and thought about writing one for almost a year. This kit gave me an easy to use formula to writing my ethical will, while helping me think for myself about its contents. It provided the impetus for getting the job done.I have also found the kit helpful for the estate planning clients in my law practice. The kit helps them express their wishes for their families and formulate their wills and trusts.This is a reasonably priced tool that, when used as intended, will guide the user through a process that he or she will find rewarding, enlightening and enriching. I recommend it highly."
3,The Ethical Will Resource Book,The topic was new to me and this seem to contain a great deal of information and guidance in how to put together such a document.
1,One star? Nothing celestial about this bog.,"An utter waste of money and time. I scanned the net on google with ""ethical will"" and got much better exhibits...at no charge."
4,The PowerPoint Key,This a great book for people that have little if any experience working with PowerPoint. The book goes on to break PowerPoint down into sections for operations. It also has a list of do's and don'ts. Overall it is a pretty solid book
5,Exciting and original research,"Linda Howe is a friend. I read her newest book both in manuscript and in final form, and must applaud her for her efforts to shed some light on the darker parts of this complex world we live in. Adopting a head in the sand stance, as most do about these phenomena, will not make them go away. If we ever truly want to understand the ""high strangeness"" of the universe we live in, we must face these unusual events that Linda has devoted her life to studying. Linda is a serious researcher, and she is nobody's fool. This book is a very important contribution to the scientific study of reality, and I highly recommend it to anyone whose mind is not closed to alternative views of our universe.Bob Shell"
3,Realizing that I have read most of this...,"elsewhere, it is well written to a point; The author used to be a network tv reporter (not saying much these days)But so much of this is rehash to meI was intrigued at the page in which she is given audience with a high military official (Air Force?)who on the subject tells her something to the effect of this: ""You dont want to know-all I can say is the we are a tiny speck of light surrounded by an ocean of darkness"" Its wording was more sinister, but this is from memory after reading long agoShe charges a stiff price for her books-many self published or boutique press titles are not nearly so expensive"
2,"Average read, little new information.","I'm a researcher in UFOs/Government Conspiracies. Not neare the level of detail as Steiger's, Marrs and Sitchin's books. Try Unconventional Flying Objects by Dr. Paul Hill (one of my favorite), Alien Agenda by Jim Marrs, Alien Rapture by Brad Steiger (one of my favorite)The author writes a lot of UFO-paranormal stuff. Little of her research is new, and much is borrowed from more worthy authors. It's a shame, because her style of writing is above average. I woud forgo her books and check out the ones I've mentioned."
1,Glimpses of other's psychosis,An extremely practical friend recommended this book and said a very reputed woman had written it etc. This is just the same old extremely bizarre totally unlikely science fiction. I have never believed anything about alien abductions and still don't. Two men in England started the crop circles and have been doing them for years. This book was very disappointing and I am embarassed that I paid money for it.
1,Revealing the facts or perpetuating myths to make a buck?,"The minute I glanced at the back cover and saw the picture of the author I immediately turned sceptical. Here is someone who has been researching such horrifying subjects as cattle mutilations and alien abductions - not to mention government lies and cover-ups, etc. The subject matter of her book and her demeanor in that photo are extremely at odds with each other. She appears as if she just won the biggest lottery on earth. Or maybe she is just simply delighted that she has managed to pull off another con job on a gullible segment of the population. Something tells me the author herself doesn't really believe what she has written in this book."
4,Great service!!!,"I ordered the teapost and received it within two weeks, but was disapointed when I noticed it was chipped. I notified amazon. UPS picked up the package the next day and the day after I received the new teapot. It couldn't have been easier or faster. Thank you,"
4,Wessex and Malaysian,"I purchased a 45 piece set of, supposedly Churchill, Blue Willow dishes in addition to a matching teapot and 9 inch bowl. Bowl stamped Wessex, made in England and teapot Wessex, made in Malaysia. None is Churchill as advertised. I can't wait to get the dish set to see where they were made. Whadayathink? Antarctica? Since the quality/price was right for the parts that I have recieved, and I'm not all that picky, I'm not complaining yet, just passing along the information."
5,A perfect pour.,"Plenty of space for a few mugs of tea -- enough for my household of three to get enough to satisfy with only one pot. Well-balanced, and easy to employ for the ""perfect,"" dripless pour. This is a teapot disinclined to dribble down the lip onto your counter after pouring, a thing I thoroughly appreciate. There is a catch in the lid to keep it from falling off and it's not too heavy to pour one-handed, even though it's on the larger side in the world of teapots. I got a bodum yoyo tea strainer to go in it and it works just fine. A teaball on a chain might be better, though. And really -- would it work better if it was made in England? It matches all the other Blue Willow Churchill pieces I have and that's good enough for me."
1,Buyer beware!!! A big disappointment and a lot of anguish,"Made in England. So it says. What I received in the box today is not a Churchill Chealsea Tea Pot but some teapot made in Malaysia. What is up with that? I suppose I have to go through the proper channels to get this straightened out. Be prepared to spend a lot of time dealing with this matter. There is no savings at all, when one counts precious time and emotional upheaval. A really big disappointment. Maybe this was an April Fool's joke, not a pre-Christmas present."
5,Beautiful and perfect,"Beautiful -- pattern is sharp, consistent in color. Perfect construction -- no gaps in glaze, especially where you might expect these gaps, such as where spout and handle are attached to body of teapot. Size is substantial for a teapot -- 6 inches in diameter, 5-1/2 inches from bottom to rim, 6-1/2 inches from bottom to top of lid.Exactly as pictured, except for one conditions which does NOT detract from beauty or value: pattern ends about 1/2 inch from top of pot, NOT at top of pot, as pictured. However, pattern is complete and in proportion, so it does not abruptly end.This is now the centerpiece of my Blue Willow collection. I will use it every day, for coffee as well as for tea. If you are a fan of Blue Willow, this is one item that you must have in your collection."
4,Aftershave,Very pleasant smell - not too sweet or overbearing.A small amount is enough. Lasts a long time. One of my favorites. Hard to find in stores and I'm glad its available through Amazon.
4,Matt Marich,"A beautiful day by day diary describing the behind the scenes drama of the Vietnam war. The on the field battles with the Viet Cong rival those within the Army and Special Forces. I only wish their were more books written in this manner, frank and to the point of what war is truly about."
4,APP Anthology Mastering?,"I have a question. On the APP Anthology CD that I got, each track begins 2 seconds early in the PREVIOUS track. Is this just the CD I have or were all CDs made like this? It IS an original, not a bootleg.If I want to hear the beginning 2 seconds of track 14, I have to listen to the end of track 13.HELP!"
4,Big Guns & Little Pistols,"Don't let the ""big guns"" intimidate you, QRP is a great way to work amateur radio. Kits like this teach you to solder, how to build kits, parts identification, and so forth. Best of all, you get a really great rig that you can use at your home QTH, or portable operations."
4,"Review of Oone, Two, Many cd","Funny movie. Not exactly to my taste, but did fine job for the type of movie it is.I am fan of Hudson Leick who was in the movie. She did a very good actor and did a good job in this film"
4,One Two Many!,I was fortunate enough to be one of the first to see this movie at its Red Carpet opening! A truly unforgettable event! A brilliant concept with John at his finest. I did want him stutter more. Ms Bellamy was beautiful to watch. You have to see it to believe it!
3,NOT a great book,"I know I'm in the minority when it comes to reviews of this book, but I really didn't think this book was all that great. In fact, I thought it was about as close to useless as a book can get. The problem is that the book is light on technique and heavy on fluff. If you're a beginning photographer, you probably need lots of technique help, and this book doesn't deliver. It won't help new photographers increase their skills because it really doesn't offer much in the way of help on the critical areas like strobe positioning, exposure control, basic composition, etc.It's not so hot for advanced photographers, either, because it doesn't offer much guidance in areas that might be useful to them, like special techniques, advanced composition, subject selection, exotic equipment, etc.All in all, I'm not sure who the book was written to help...I'm just reasonably sure it won't help many people.Pick another book."
3,Not as good as the first,"Last Oct.06 I bought the first book,""Limu the Blue Turtle"" for my 2 year old while we where in Maui. she loves it and enjoys having it read to her. This one is not as good. It is shorter and some of the characters are missing. The animation is pretty good however and is worth having,if you have the first one. Bottom line,If Kimo writes another,I hope it is better then this one. Limu RULES!!!. Mahalo"
4,No Pendant,"We all know the movie is great. I've seen it again just last week after over 15 years and it still influences my love to Orcas. The only thing I want to say here, because there is a picture of the VHS PLUS pendant from a costumer - I ordered it because I once threw away my pendant (thought I need to seperate to grow up) and wanted one again. Because of the picture I assumed this order has the pendant in it but it doesn't! So if you are seeking for the extra - like me - you'll need to find it somewhere else."
5,awe-inspiring,Truly heart-stirring.This remains one of the best movies I have ever seen. I wish all movies could be like this one.
3,"Good Movie, the first one was sooo much better","its a follow-up. its definatly worth watching. i think the third movie was a bit much but it was nice to see what was happening to jesse. the first one was alot better. it was about the connection between an orphaned boy and whale and how they freed eachother. it was an amazing movie if you exclude the michael jackson video at the beginning but i usually just fast forward through that, no harm done. the second one is a good investment though if you loved the first one."
2,Not heartwarming as the original but not that great.,"This movie was relaese on theaters near Christmas on 1995, the movie was so more adventorous instead of heartwarming. The only thing that made me sad was Willy's sister was sick from that oil suck to her blowhole. I could give it a 4 stars, but the characters suck so bad, Jason James Ritcher, the kid who played the old Jesse is back but all grownup, in the beggining of the movie a police tells him that original mother died and he will send Jesse's half-brother, the half brother is too annoying and so stupid, that I could slap him, The rest of the movie seems more black hearted than,well.... A black-hearted thing, the criminals are dumb somebody should tell them what to do. The other parts of this movie are good, but the half-brother and the villians and also the dialogue need more improvement."
3,FREE WILLY FROM CONTINUEINTY!,"Well, the sequel to the mega-hit, FW. It's not all you'll anticipate.The plot's better. The boy must help the freed fish find his way home. But oil spills complicate things.The acting... ughsh... the plot... double ughsh... the directing... WHAT DIRECTING?!... All in all, the video doesn't have any sense. Don't waste your pretty penny."
1,Free Willy 2,The disc skipped half way through the disk and I cannot get anyone to rectify the situation.
1,Not worth a dollar,"Considering the dvd-worthy titles out there awaiting digital transfer, I was a little surprised to find this 70s-era made-for-television movie in the $1 cut-out bin at a local used book store.A WOMAN ACCUSED is unwatchable (never thought I'd say that about a movie that has Anthony Zerbe in it.) The problem is with the sound. Background noises and music swamp the dialogue track - somebody walking across a room sounds like the French army storming the gates of Moscow. A background violin drowns out whatever the actors are saying. Not being a lip-reader I couldn't finish this movie. If you're thinking about purchasing it, buy it from a reputable dealer that allows returns."
2,Poor Quality,This was my wife's 1st lesbian movie that she saw as a teenager... I hadn't ever heard of it or seen it.. so we purchased it to add to our collection. The Quality of the dvd was terrible and the sound was almost non existant.. you could barely hear the movie no matter how loud u turned it up. I don't know if we got a bad copy or it all of them are that poorly converted from vcr to dvd. I was very disappointed.
2,Bad copy,"I purchased this DVD to add to my collection of works with appearances by Chad Everett. This film is promoted as a mystery/crime drama, and appeared that it would have been quite a good movie had I actually been able to hear any of the DVD. I was very disappointed in the quality as the sound was like it had been filmed on the corner of Pitt St in Sydney. So loud was the background noise with traffic and blaring horns, that it was impossible to hear any of the dialogue in the movie. So disappointed.... I wasted no time in returning the item, and will continue my hunt for better copy."
1,Expected NEW version; received a copy on DVD-R with smudged labeling,"I loved this little movie when it was first shown on TV (it was called ""The Glitter Palace"" then) years ago and have always wanted a copy so when I saw this for sale I had to get it. Nowhere in the details does it say that this is a COPY seemingly done by computer transfer program. I received the movie on a DVD-R with the black labeling ink all smudged (not even laser sketched). It was a worse copy than the VHS I had taped all those years ago (and has long since deteriorated). I don't understand how it's even allowed to be sold so I am returning it with much disappointment."
1,Wrong book to read if you really want to know the truth,"The book is totally misleading since the author does not have any actual knowledge of the region. I will say that his only attention was to write a book on a popular topic in that time and make money. The main theme in this book is not to inform or educate. Choose some other book if you want to learn more about the Balkans and the conflict in the 90's. A historian or a professional researcher would be a better choise than Greg Campbell, (an English major writer not knowledgeable in the subject)."
2,Could be fun if it wasn't so long!,"I bought this for my daughter (age 4) for Christmas, and she was thrilled to be getting her own game, and about dinosaurs, no less! Unfortunately her enthusiasm (and mine, my almost 6 year old son's, my husband's, and my mother-in-law's) quickly died out as we played. It is advertised as similar to Candyland, which it is. But unlike Candyland, there are very few ways to change the order of the players--once someone gets out in front, they stay there. Even playing at Level 1, when you don't have to answer the questions, it is just too long. And as for the questions...well, there is one question card for each area on the board. On the card is a question for each color on the die. So if everyone rolls the same color (which did happen when we played), then everyone gets the same question. So basically, we are pretty disappointed with the game. The best part about it seems to be fitting the dinosaur puzzle pieces into each side of the board."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this cd upon the recommendations of the reviews on this website. I must say that with all the good reviews posted I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, or I didn't get what I was expecting. First of all, where is the "" Old School Cabaret Style and a Jazzy Touch."" The only cabaret style about this cd is maybe her voice. As for the jazzy touch, there is just a touch of saxophone. I felt like I should be shopping at the Marche. So I guess in a way it did transport me to France. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy listening to some of the songs, they just didn't live up to some of the other reviews. If you are a Liane Foly fan, I am sure that as with other the reviewers, you will like it."
1,Boring,"Leane Foley's ""Acoustique"" is irksome, monotonous, and lacking originality. I love French music and often gamble by buying a new CD without knowing what's in the package. It's a first one yet that delivers NO charm and NO light at the end of the tunnel."
1,What a shockingly bad book,"If anyone out there has read a worse book than this in the last five years I'd be surprised. I'm only glad I read someone else's copy and didn't pay out my own money for this drivel. How do books this bad get published? Wafer-thin characters, disastrously ill-conceived plot, and yet it makes the bestseller lists. Or so we're told. I understand the author has a new book out -- I for one will not be reading it."
3,A High Concept That Doesn't Quite Fulfill Its Promise,"I've always had a taste for big thrillers and this book has sat on my nightstand for years. Finally I'm finding more time to read and Neanderthal made for good entertainment. This novel starts out a bit rocky, jumping from character to character, before it settles down into a strong, well-paced narrative that I couldn't put down.About a third of way in it begins to sag, unfortunately. The pay-off doesn't quite meet the build-up, and some of the characterization is middling. For example, the heroine seems preoccupied with lazily removing her underwear before skinnydipping, ha ha, which is fine and good except that she's in a dangerous jungle surrounded by threats of all kinds. The pacing falls off and the heroes take a very long time finding their way to a resolution, which, when it comes, is mostly well done. I had some quibbles with how the military characters act.I'd give Neanderthal three and a half stars."
2,Barely Readable,"Breakdown:Predictability: Certain.Dialogue: 4th grade level.Science: Gives anti-evolutionists ammunition.Characters: In a witness protection program.Furthest Page Reached: 120Book recommended via: Overbooked.Further comments:I think this may have been written overnight when Darnton suddenly realized he was on deadline. I can come up with no other reason for the sheer idiocy involved in the dialogue and 'foreshadowing' (also called 'foretelling', since Darnton likes to be prescriptive) in this 'novel'.Recommended alternate use:Kindling; packing material."
2,Maybe Next Time,"John Darnton clearly did a lot of research on Neanderthals -- more than he had to and enough to make the book somewhat rewarding. But the lack of basic craft skill is stunning. Plot complications appear out of nowhere, inconvenient characters mysteriously get the vapors just as they are about to tie things in knots, and one of the characters actually packs ""a .345 magnum"" handgun (no such thing exists).Still, there must be something there or I wouldn't have staggered this close to the finish line (I've got about 60 pages to go). Darnton should study the works of folks who can write real plots and create real characters. Or, better yet, maybe he should sell the film rights and quit while he's ahead."
1,Struggle from start to finish,"Extremely disappointing read. I had to struggle to finish the book. Unfortunatley, I bought this book because of it's advertising campaign. Huge displays at your local booksore with an add in the USA Today along with a headline that includes the words ""Jurassic Park!"", I was sucker punched. This book did not have one thrilling tense moment at all. Judging from the other reviews, I'm not alone. I only wish that I had taken heed to everyone's thoughts of wisdom. You've been warned. It's not worth the trip"
1,BAD!,"Don't waste you money on this book, instead buy you self a ""burrito"" and it will leave you more satisfied than this book."
1,"Eeeek, stay away, or just read Jurrasic Park again!","Honestly, this book stunk. It makes interesting enough reading, but there are too many glaring holes in the science and in the plot. It is completely predictable, after every plot twist, I found I was not surprised, even the ending was obvious, I figured out what would happen from at least 100 pages in advance. Alas the charcters are awful. What starts as horrible characterization becomes worse as the writer make everybody either too dumb or too mean to be sympathetic. I mean come on, they have to cross a bridge with not much weight, so they bring a tape recorder with Bruce Springsteen and some flares, but leave the tents behind, in the high mountains!?! These people are supposed to be brilliant, but time after time they are shown to be stuipid. Honostly, go read some real Sci-Fi Horror style stuff like Legacy Of Herot or something."
2,Disappointing-could have been so much better than it was,"Such a disappointment--I normally really enjoy this sort of book and had looked forward to reading it after all the hype. Can't believe I read the whole thing--I kept hoping that the book would live up to the hype and the interesting premise. So much could have been done better-I was constantly re-writing the plot in my head as I went along. So many potentially interesting subjects could have been explored and were left dangling or not touched at all. Attempts at a romance, suspense, adventure seemed to fall flat and I felt the writing itself wasn't good at all. Situations would come up that I felt could have been resolved or carried out in a very interesting manner so I'd keep on reading only to be disappointed. As others have mentioned, the characters were not sympathetic to me at all. If this is made into a movie, I plan to avoid it and save having my movie ticket money wasted, as my book money was"
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing,"This book had so much promise. What an interesting premise! Yeah, but it was so incredibly BAD, I was rolling my eyes constantly. My gf picked it up, but she had the good sense to stop reading it a little ways into it.The writing is ok. The plot, characters, peripherals are just horrible. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Can I make that a negative one star?,"This represents the old saying perfectly: ""You can't judge a book by it's cover."" I did. That's why I bought this horrible thing. It makes me wonder where publishers find the reviewers that throw praise at such garbage. I can recall reading the cover at the time of purchase and thinking ""Wow, this sounds good!"" It wasn't. It was probably one of the most terrible novels I've ever read. The characters lose any sort of complexity before the mid way point. The plot reveals itself as an underresearched joke far too soon. The story unfolds slowly into the waste of words that it is. If you read this, then don't buy it. Save yourself!"
3,Fun and Interesting Read,"As far fetched as it is, this novel still is a good read. The ending was not so great, but the information packed in the middle, most of it fact about Neanderthal, is interesting and worth the read.I would call this a beach or vacation read. It goes quickly and does not have too much information to bog down the action. It would be comparable to Jurassic Park or a similar type novel. You know getting into it that it is far fetched and not meant to be taken serious, but it still entertains.Fast paced, likable characters, easy to follow! Fun times!"
3,A pretty good story...,"I read this book with no expectations, I just saw it on my bookshelf one day and gave it a try. I won't give any ""spoilers"" just the basics: A group of humans make an incredible discovery, they find two lost tribes of Neanderthals in Tadjikistan, the tribes are very disparate one is peaceful and one is agressive. I think Darnton is a good author, he knows how build a suspenseful story. One unique ability the Neanderthals have is so surprising, it's something you will never expect, it makes for an interesting challenge for the humans who find themselves in a difficult conflict. It's a pleasant read, with some surprises, and at times this book deeply examines human nature."
2,Needs to evolve,"Darnton needs to evolve to a higher level of story telling. I may have learned something from reading Neanderthal, but so what. I didn't care for any of the characters and while the plot was obvious, there was no craft in it's unfolding. Darnton could learn something from Clive Cussler, who writes the best ""pure crap"" in this genre period. Billing this book as anything remotely resembling ""Indiana Jones"" is a travesty"
2,"Nice Try ,but no cigar","Sorry about my language but this book sucked! This book looks promising by being a bestseller, but is not as good as you might think it is. The first 1/3 of the book makes it hard to put down, but the remaining 2/3 is very dull. If you are a John Darton fan you will probably be glad it is a bestseller, but if you are looking for a thriller this is not the book"
4,Fiction = Not Fact!,"If this book represents the ""dumbing down"" of America, these reviews represent the ""snobing up"". From simply reading the outer cover of the book and seeing the premise of it, I was able to sumise that ""believability"" was not going to be one of the stronger points of the book. With that in mind, I read the book in order to be entertained, NOT to be educated on the nuances and historic facts of living Neanderthals. I admit that Darnton went overboard with many of his details and anecdotes, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this was an interesting and entertaining read. If you read this book for what it is, I'm sure you will be entertained. If you are expecting anthropological fact, go to a museum"
3,A good idea surrounded by a simplistic story.,"In a nutshell, Darnton uses worn, stock characters to write an Indiana Jones novel. The hero and heroine are surrounded by perilous mountains, deceptive Cold War spies, national enemies (the Russians), and bloodthirsty primitives with special powers.Danger lurks at every turn. The main characters (surprise!) rediscover their love for each other. The bad guys get theirs, the good guys walk away scared but unscathed, and we learn that the Russians are good guys too.Change a few minor details, and you get the script for ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" Been there, done that.This would have been more interesting if Darnton had put forward some deep discussions of neanderthal life, though admittedly, everything we know about our long lost cousins is conjecture"
3,It is an OK fantasy.,"I love prehistoric history and good science fiction. This is more prehistoric fantasy set in a modern setting. If you can handle that Neanderthals are found alive and kicking, good. If you can handle bad science, simple characters, mind reading, and magic this is the book for you. And brain eating. Don't forget that.Otherwise go reread Clan of the Cave Bear. Older but better. Outdated yes, but still better. Much better."
3,Exciting then Mundane,"This book started out quite exciting with the idea of creatures that were of the Ice Age and yet had developed a capability beyond ours RV/ESP. The first 1/3 of this book was very interesting, but once the characters escaped the hominids the first time the book became predictable and mundane, and the ending wasn't well put together as it only was composed of the last few pages. The author wrote a decent book and then obviously didn't put nearly enough time or effort into the ending."
1,"Ahhhh, the fireplace never felt more warm!","The book was somewhat interesting, in a crash scene sort of way--you find that you can't stop reading on, even though you know you shouldn't. (How many pages does it take until the human brain finally figures out that your wasting its time?) All in all, the story consisted of two dimensional characters, a loosely researched plot, and outdated science. Save your money!"
1,reads like a bad hollywood script,"This book is an unfortunate waste of resources. The premise is creditable but the execution is staggeringly disappointing. Cardboard characters, flimsy and contrived storylines, supposedly intelligent and educated individuals behaving stupidly, and the degree to which belief has to be suspended to get through this book are just the main reasons this book deserves to go out of print. As I progressed through the book it became obvious the writing was done as though the writer were behind a camera and writing as though to set up the scene to be filmed. The problem is this is not a film where such lapses of plot and character development are compensated for to some degree by special effects, music and popcorn. I wanted to like this book - I couldn't."
1,"So that's what ""big foot: is!","This book is very far fetched even though it does try to explain the ""big foot"" myth. It's slow reading with poorly developed characters. It has some entertainment value but do not pay full price for this book."
1,Good grief! Their time has NOT come ...,"Darnton is no Chricton This book seemed to be devoid of scientific research. We know a lot about Neandertals now, but Darnton ignores it all. And he comes up with an AWFUL moral to his story ... one that's an insult not just to his characters but to all of homo sapiens. There's some action, but it's contrived. I did not enjoy this one in case you can't tell ... :-)"
4,Excellent Job by Darnton,"This book is perfect for summer reading. The book is full of exciting and suspenseful moments that will keep you reading. I liked the teasers at the end of every chapter. The only thing I didn't like about this book is the pointless sex, like when they were in the cave dancing naked around the fire. I would reccomend this book to anyone who loved Jurassic Park."
3,Mezza Mezza,"While the idea is very interesting and well thought out, I felt that the author was having trouble keeping the reader interested. It was drawn out in places and needed more...Oomph! I was interested throughout half of the story yet had to push my way to the end only to be neither excited nor dissapointed with the outcome. Overall great idea, bland execution."
3,"Interesting story line, but fails to deliver","This novel was disappointing; the author failed to maintain my interest about the time the modern crew found themselves in the Neanderthal Shangra-la. I found ALMOST ADAM is much better and sustained story, but two older works dealing with Neanderthal-Homo sapien interfaces are EATERS OF THE DEAD and THE INHERITORS."
4,"If you're predisposed to origins, Neanderthal is a fun read.","Reviewers, lighten up! If you're interested inan intellectually stimulating story about an ape,read Daniel Quinn's Ishmael. Darnton's book isjust a fun read for those of us who are predisposedto thinking about origins. I thought it was agood book to read on the beach. I probablywouldn't buy the T-shirt anyway!"
1,Painful to read,"This book was one of the worst popular fiction works I have ever read. The initial idea was worthy of the likes of Jurassic Park but the final product left much to be desired. The characterizations were horrible. An example of this is the character of Van, in which we are told that he had a horrible childhood, thereby making a stock bad guy character. The plot line was so predictable that I was left with a boring read at best. Also the interdispersed sexual theme was laughable. The language read like an uninspired 12 year old wrote it. An example of this is the catch phrases (riddle wrapped in an enigma is my favorite, which occurs near the beginning).How did this book ever get published is my final question at the end of the book. I think that whoever the author is, he had better stick to his day job."
3,"beach read,","This is at best a good beach read. Fluff with some substance. Darnton sets out an interesting premise and lay outs some of the science behind it. Unfortunetly there are huge logic leaps and the book often requires a large amount of ""suspension of disbelief"" to work.It is clearly written in the mode of ""Jurrasic Park"" or ""Congo"" with an eye for a movie deal (the book jacket all but screams it) which is fine, but Darnton's scientific expose does not come near Crichton's style.Sufice to say, like Crichton, the characters are there to talk about science, get into ""danger"" but not much else.Would be a great book for a long flight or a lazt day at the beach."
1,It took months to read this book,"This novel began with what I thought seemed like an interesting idea then went into evil plots, telekinesis and whatever...I put it down several times then picked it up again because I was convinced that the plot had to be going somewhere. They would not publish a book this bad without reading it first, would they? Well, apparently someone did, I guess. A reasonably good idea with possibilities drifted into a mess that seemed like a story someone might have written in middle school. yawner."
1,ATROCIOUS!!!,"I was browsing through the bookstore when I saw the title Neanderthal. I have always been fascinated with that period of history, so I decided I would purchase it. I am a fool.It starts interestingly enough, providing a informative primer to neanderthals, but it the novel goes quickly degenerates into nonsensical madness. The characters are incredibly poorly developed, and actually quite unlikeable. How many times do we have to read about a broken relationship between a man and woman, and forced to reconcile amid extreme danger? At one point, the ""heros"" of the novel tacitly participate in the cold blooded murder of one the expedition to central asia.The ending is comical. While it was bad enough that they used a ""trojan horse"" concept to trick the neanderthals, doing to the ""Born in the USA"" was the capper. This was would have been a good episode of McGyver."
2,AAARRRGGGHHH!,"Good thing I just got this from a garage sale. Otherwise, I would have hit my head with a club if I bought it at a higher price. No offense meant to those readers who liked the story. Just didn't like it. Somehow, it just feels something is lacking. Though it has some similarities with Indiana Jones, I don't think it even comes close."
2,Neanderthal,"John Darton may be a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, but he certainly is lacking in the fiction department. Neanderthal was a boring, laborious read that I had to push myself to get through. It was basically a poorly written, third grade attempt to rewrite Jurassic Park with neanderthal's in the lead instead of dinosaur's. The characters are cardboard, at best, and the plot (what little there is to it) never lives up to its possibilities. There is no suspense, and what little action there is was pointless. I found myself wishing that the Neanderthal's would just kill everyone so the book would be over quickly"
3,Advanced Fiction,"I pulled this book of the shelf at my library and gave it a chance. My reason for doing so was because the inside jacket stated the novel was being made into a movie by Steven Speilberg????? I must say this book was exciting. There is non-stop action. If you're searching for the meaning of life between two hard covers you'll be dissapointed. If you just want a fun, fast read give this a try."
1,I'm sorry I've bought this bomb!,"No ofense, this is the worst book I've read in the last ten years. Bad caracters/Bad script/Bad luck. Keep your money in your pocket!!!"
2,A Testament to the Accuracy of Amazon User Reviews,"Before I struggled through Neanderthal, I surfed to Amazon.com to get a feel for how the book was being received by ""the public"". To my surprise, most reviews were generally negative, but I thought, ""well, maybe I'LL like it"". I mean, how can a novel about the discovery of a group of Neanderthals living in today's world not be cool?Well, I was wrong. Dreadfully wrong. Neanderthal is an awful book. Like past reviewers wrote, it was difficult to finish. Like past reviewers wrote, it was pretty hard to believe. And like past reviewers that knew Jurassic Park wrote, it's no Jurassic Park. I really should have listened.So, if you are thinking about reading Neanderthal, take it from me and my fellow reviewers, read something else - learn from our pain. Go get From Lucy to Language and have fun imagining your own neanderthal story - the odds are it will be a lot better than this one."
1,"""Character-killing"" the Neanderthals","This book tried to profit on the success attained by the""Jurassic Park"" movies, while the subject ofPaleoanthropology is fascinating the premise and stories inthis book is plainly astrayed. A lost tribe of Neanderthalsis found to be alive somewhere in Asia and an expeditiondeparts to study them, there the main characters willinteract with hominids that are depicted as beastly and thatuse Telepathy! Can you believe this? What a contradiction onthe conception of the Neanderthals in this novel: dangeroustelepath brutes. And there is something dirty as well, at onepoint it almost seem that there is going to be sex betweenthe Neanderthals and one of the main characters. Tabloidzoophilia the likes of ""I married Bigfoot"". I don't recommend this book."
2,Trial and Failure,"Mr Darnton took an interesting concept and managed to publish it as a terrible book. Dissapointment cannot single-handedly summarise my opinion of this book. I mean, telephatic neanderthals! Please. Is there suppose to be a romance between the two lead characters; Susan and Matt or what? The plot is quite far-fetched and with too much loop holes. How did a lush forest paradise materialise in the barren frigid fields of Tajakistan anyway? Altogether frustrating a reader who is accustomed to better reads.Opinion: Excellent idea, bad book."
3,"So, So!!!","Okay, the novel wasn't the best ever, but it wasn't the worst. The first half is fairly good, the second half is kind of silly, and uninteresting. In the early part of the story the author has the reader believing that they are about to embark a journey into the past, and may even learn answers to our own pre-history. I know that this book was a work of fiction, but it could have been a little more researched and alot more realistic."
3,"Enjoyable, at times...","I enjoyed this book, at times. But then reading it was somewhat like a chore at times as well. True, it has a lot of action, but typical ""Hollywood"" action. Maybe it will make a popular movie someday."
3,Is It Bigfoot Or Have Some People Disregarded Razors?,"I don't dabble much in the field of the neanderthal,but this novel brings to life the mystery of just such a subject for anyone. I read a summary of this book as a small advertisement and decided it was too good to pass up. It was an entertaining read as I would recommend this piece to anybody interested in the strange and unknown."
1,Don't waste your time!,This is an extrememly no-brainer book that takes a totally urealistic look at how archeology works in the real world. Save your money and reread your Jurassic Park.
3,somewhat entertaining,a somewhat entertaining tale of neanderthal man discovered by modern man who witnesses two clans of neanderthals combatting eachother. a perfect story scrip to star charles dutton and mark wahlberg. i didnt hate it but i will not remember it a month from now. this book needed more of a CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR research method employed and a better decription of the battle scenes.
1,Don't buy this,"All the bad reviews have been accurate; this book was surely written expecting to be made into a movie aimed at 10 year olds - 2-dimensional characters, superficial plot and unforgivably no attempt to challenge or educate the reader. The ""scientists"" have no more knowledge than you'd pick up watching TLC for a week; their eagerness to train the good hominids to kill is a low point in a dismall literary effort. Read Stonehenge by Bernard Cornwell; it isn't that great, but you'll get infinitely more from it than you will from Neanderthal."
2,Could have been better,"The book reminded me of a B movie out of the 1950's era. I was waiting for the 50 foot woman to save the day. The character development was very shallow. To keep it as positive as I can, I would say it was mildly entertaining. I am happy that I used my library card instead of my cash."
1,Starts out great then fails big time!,"I picked up this book at the Anchorage Airport on my way to the village as I had nothing to read. The beginning grabbed me and was fast paced - My kind of book. Then something happens to the plot, characters, and writing style. It turns predictable, superficial, and sophmoric. The whole thing is totally unbelievable and reeks with bad science. It's a great idea gone very bad. I did, however finish the book just to see if the bad guys win. The only thing missing with the telepathic and stupid but somehow very intelligent neanderthals living in a lost world in the Himalayas was their contact with aleins."
2,Once i was finished i was not happy..,It had a great idea! Yet he could not pull it off ? Good story line dies as u go farther into the world of this book..It is lame :( A real bummer i was hopeing something atleast i could enjoy and finish..but if u are looking for a good entertaing smart and funny book ? Run away from here..
1,the worst book i have EVER read,"this book is a pathetic attempt to mimic Crichtons ""Eaters of the Dead"" with a splash of cheap soap opera thrown in. i have read better sci-fi from elementary kids. as a sci-fi addict and senior anthropology student i was appalled at Darntons use of 30 year old, outdated theories on man, neanderthals, and his use of the ""noble savage"" concept. i was also appalled that this book was labelled as being in the same league as Crichtons books and that someone had the nerve to try and deceive the public by labelling it a best seller. the only reason i finished the book is because it was given to me freely and i was in the deep desert with nothing else to read. this book is nothing but pathetic trash!! read Crichton if you like the concept but don't spend your money on junk like ""Neanderthal""!!"
3,"Original idea, need some workover","Almost a good effort. Darnton starts out with a brilliant idea, but hastened too much to finish the book. Start was fine, but the fate of characters never tantilized me. Unsurprising end. Love scenes poorly written and do no good for the tale. For a tale it is. Not fact. Easy to read for film goers. Not as good as Jurassic Park, but next time?"
1,the book was horrible!,"after reading this book, i can't wait to give it away. the strat of the book was so interesting but after the first 50 pages... i couldn't wait to finish it... as in close the book and forget it."
1,The Worst!,"This so called novel (actually I think it was a recycled outline for a comic book that got rejected) is no doubt the worst book I have read in memory. Ever! The research must have consisted of a quick scan of an online encyclopedia article. The gun was mentioned by others. And cave painting in grottos of stalagtites/mites--sorry, way too wet (maybe watercolors?). Plus, the remote area above treeline precludes all the giant bonfires! The 'characters', ugha ugha. And there was no 'Clinton' character or was that Van??? Hmmm...I will give a 10, better yet an 11, to the agent, though. Anyone who can sell abject garbage like this 'book' for the no doubt stratospheric $$$ entailed--well, I haven't heard of any bridges changing hands. Yet.Save your money. 'Dr. Strangelove meets the Yeti', oops, I mean 'Neanderthal' doesn't work. Fortunately, Mr. Speilberg can afford a good rewrite (hopefully Darnton will be covering a breaking story in, oh, say Tajikistan or even Scotland)."
3,"OK, but I have a better suggestion!","The book was to fast and not very intellectually engaging. Yes, this is popular fiction but I feel this is more in the realm of a young adult book rather than a book for adult readers. I suggest a book by Micheal Crichton called Eaters of the Dead, minus the odd name it is a far superior book."
1,Unfortunate,"After having read quite a few reviews of this book, I was surprised by the number of positive comments. Many people commented that the real science should be ignored in favor of the story. In the example of Star Wars someone gave, that is true. Star Wars never touted itself as anything but purely unrealistic fiction. This work, however, seemed to claim otherwise. And even if the science isn't perfect, that's forgiveable if the rest of the book is, well, good. Unfortunately, this book wasn't good or accurate, nor was it realistic. But I suppose in the end the money is what matters."
2,"Ludicrous, even as fiction","This book is sophomoric science (high school, not college). Where did Dalton get his research material, the ""Just So"" series. The movie rights have been picked up by Spielberg, which is appropriate, because the science in ""Neanderthals"" is on the same level as ""Jurassic Park"", almost non-existent. No wonder America is dumbing down, we read (and apparently believe) too much pseudo-intellectual fiction, and have almost no comprehension of science fact"
3,"Great idea, bad execution",I picked this story up because I was fascinated by the concept. The idea that neadersal man could developing ESP I thought was very cool. So I checked the book out and got about halfway through. The problem in this book lies not with the concept but with the characters. Them seem like they are ripped from the pages of a soap opera. Instead of worrying about the scientific discoveries and important stuff like that the two main protagonists seem only interested in having sex with each other. Never mind that they are high up in the mountains being chased by a bunch of homicidal hominids.Overall-Great idea the author must really want the reader to go take an anthropology 101 class.
2,Lots Of Promise. Didn't Deliver,I really wanted to like this book. The subject matter appeals to me. But there just wasn't any spark. A stuggle to even finish
2,Difficult to finish,"Although the idea is pretty neat, Mr. Darnton,in my opinion, simply didn't have what it tookto keep the reader's intrest. This was a difficult read in the sense that it was hard tocontinue reading. But, perhaps with some work,Mr. Darnton will imporve and rise to level ofCrichton, but one thing is for sure - he is notthere yet(as the cover of the book states)."
2,"Nice Concept, but not a Page Turner","I was intrigued by the concept of the book. Unfortunately the author didn't deliver on the product. I found that the characters were left undeveloped, the government fell in to the old (Power Hungry) stereotype, and it left an unanswered ending. It was an average read, but I wouldn't recommend it"
2,Okay attempt,"It was great attempt to give us a picture of the life of neanderthals in the past. I thought it might in the begining be like the Clan of the Cave Bear, but was not"
2,Another Jurassic Park Wannabe,"It's obvious that the author tried to write the next Jurassic Park. The idea behind this book is promising, but he doesn't deliver. I love trashy sci-fi books -- kind of like the sitcoms of literature -- but this one just develops too many twists and turns. And the characters are never really developed into people we would care about. In the end, you're almost rooting for the Neanderthals to put them out of the angst-driven agony"
4,Cute and Pleasing,"Drummer Hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of Drummer Hoff, the man who ""fired it off."" In this story, a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon. Each man brings something different. One man brings the barrel, one man brings the carriage, and at the every end of each stanza it says ""but Drummer Hoff fired it off.""This story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story. The colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal. The story itself doesn't have any significant moral element to it...it is just a fun book. The rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous. By the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess.Children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud. A good holiday gift."
3,Woodcut Drummer,"There is a rhyme that adds a line each segment as the primary text in this book. A cute story, though it is lacking a true beginning-middle-end, it could help children with rhyming words and the concepts of rime and onset. The illustrations are clever, interesting and appealing. They were created with carved woodblocks that were then dipped into ink and used like stamps. The curious feature however is the element of line and the way it is utilized.Why 3 stars?:There is no real story to this. The rhyme is pointless and uninteresting. It possibly could have better if it went somewhere, but it is quite short. I considered using it for practice with rhyming, but the rhymes are fairly difficult. I would pass this one up unless you are a true collector of Caldecott winners."
5,Shared reader,"Don't pick apart the text too much, it won't make much sense to adults. Just be assured that within the first minute, any child will be completely engaged by the brilliant, somewhat old fashioned woodcut pictures and by the second or third reading will be crowing the refrain ""fired it off!"" with abandoned glee.We finally discovered a paperback edition while at the Presidio bookstore in San Francisco, thereby giving the library copy a much needed rest. Yes, it ends abruptly and leaves me perplexed as to what exactly happened, but my children simple accept it as is and really enjoy testing their memories with cumulative rhymes."
5,Kids Love It,"A 5 year old actually recommended this book to me.I was at the library, looking for children's books (so I can study and write them myself)and there was a kid and his mom there who pointed this book out to me.The little boy actually wanted to read it again but his mom said he's raid it more than a dozen times.If you find one with a cassette tape, it's great.The illustration's different from most children's books. It seems simplistic but the rhymes are fun and it actually has an underlying message to it--peace. After the Kaboom! A page of flowers and butterflies...I'd also suggestCorduroy (Book & CD)"
5,Great pictures...fun little tale...a family favorite,"My three-year-old son LOVES this book. We have checked it out over and over again from the library, and finally decided to get it for him as a Christmas gift. Since the story is told in a repetitive little rhyme, it is very easy to memorize, so now my son insists that he ""read"" it to me. The illustrations are superb, a worthy Caldecott winner."
5,Drummer Hoff,I bought it and read it to my daughters.Now ages 38 and 36.I've done the same for each of my granchildren.Without question...my favorite childrens book.My daughters can still recite the entire book from memory.
2,guitars can be better,My guitar didn't even come like they said it would.they tape stuff over the white part on the body was peeled off it was rusty and three springs were missing on the bottom of it were they rectangle thing is at and it wasnt blue it was matallic lite blue like torquise. atleast it plays right...almost right.
4,i have a guitar like this at home,"at a local guitar store i bought a planet rock guitar like this. it is a really great guitar and can play any kind of music. but the cables and guitar straps that came with it sucked. so i bought some more and they worked perfectly. about 5 monthes after i bought it the thing that attached to the guitar strap kept coming off. so i super-glued it and it works fine. for this guitar i recomend a levys leathers guitar strap. i have a rat fink ""surf all day"" guitar strap. if you are a beginner i recomend a beginner pack just like this. for this guitar green cable look good with it. if you want cooler picks than the ones on amazon.com i recomend going to hotpicksusa.com. take it fom me an innocent child buy it if you think it is the right thing to buy. but i like b.c. rick guitars way better than that one. but you can at least buy a guitar here to make mr. amazon happy. so do it!"
3,What A Steal,I mean seriously this is a steal but i wouldn't expect much from this just becuase it int eh 90 $ ranger but i cnat wait to get it.
3,Good but not great,"It is a good book, but is not our favorite.It has nice pictures and it was delivered early and it was in great shape."
4,"Good basic kit, might be cheaper at your local department stores.","Good basic kit, might be cheaper at your local department stores. Cleaner is nice but the included oil is very light, not heavy enough for some firearms and lighter than I would recommend using."
2,"SKIRTS, SKIRTS, SKIRTS!","...it's all about ""skirts"": everywhere, on everything...Now, while there are some cute ideas in this book, I find it walks that fine line between kitschy-fun and tacky-no-no; to be quiet honest, most of this book reminds me that not *EVERYTHING* has to/should be decorated.Happy Crafting!"
5,Great classy looking storage ideas,I love this book! This is the third one I have bought...I keep sharing them with friends who love it too. It has real doable ideas that look great.
4,Part of the Puzzle,"This is a beautiful book with lots of images. The content addresses mostly the ""what"" and ""where"". You will need other references for the ""why"" and ""how"". Fortunately, there are a number with good reviews on Amazon."
2,Para pasar el rato,"Es un libro que combina el pasado con el presente, pero no esta a la altura de Barbara Wood por ejemplo que escribe de manera similar, deja muchas cosas a la casualidad o a la suerte, esta mejor (no por mucho el ocho de la misma autora)"
2,This book is a quick hack....Disappointing,"... The book was poorly written, not enough creenshots. I suspect that it was hacked very quickly to hit the shelves in time as it is the only book on the 8.5 version (at the time).I give it a 2 stars because is still helps you getting started with director. I was in hurry so I had to buy this book. If you have time, look for something else !"
1,You can't give 0 stars.,"I was happy with the product like the other reviewers. This was temporary. The product was made by in China by Team Products (since gone under according to a Ripoff Report) and sold under the Coleman name. The one I bought came in a two pack with this inverter and a smaller Team Products/Coleman inverter (70-90 watts, no fan). Both inverters are dead and all fuses are in tact, including in vehicle. I expected better from Coleman."
5,At last!!!,"I have an HP laptop that requires 180 watts to operate. It would not work in my car or on an airplane (typically 70 watt supply). I called HP (got nowhere) and finally found this transformer. It really works! I can use my power hungry laptop anywhere now.Phil SpryClayton, nC"
1,BEWARE!,"Please be aware that this edition of this album listed as Rohit International Records sounds like it's been dubbed from vinyl, badly. There is a lot of distortion on the high end and surface noise is audible throughout. If none of that bothers you, the music isn't bad, but certainly doesn't rank among The Heptones finer moments."
1,Broke on 2nd use!,"What a disappointment! The engine blew out the second time I used this blender. And right in the middle of a dinner party too, which was a problem. Thank goodness my food processor was up to the challenge. I'm sticking with KitchenAid or Cuisinart from now on."
1,It's not 56 ounces!,"I received this, realized it was only 48 ounces even though it's advertised as 56 ounces, returned it, it apparantly got lost in the mail, so I lost my $47 without anything to show because PresentsForYou says it's not in their warehouse. Not a good experience."
5,"The ""Hidden Gem"" of Mexican Cinema","A magnificent work from our brothers and sisters to our south. Truly riveting in it's expression of 1960's contemporary Mexico. By that I mean a mad scientist's dream and a city's nightmare. Not many films of this era effectively use strong women to ""defeat"" evil as they did in this film. A risk taken full force with no hesitation. A true film noir treasure. Not to mention the ominous meanings in Gomar's ""Special Equipment"" and the good natured bafoonery of Tommy. He truly lightened the intense feeling of this film. Watch it if you dare!"
1,This flick is so bad it's actually funny!,"The plot stinks, the dialogue is awful, and the acting wooden, yet this movie has its moments, i.e.,when the women kick butt and take names, and save the men (for once!) This is almost unheard of in the sci-fi & horror, or any other genre, for that matter, which makes it all the more enjoyable. Another great moment is The Golden Ruby's response to the little policeman when he tells her that he and his buddy with protect her. This is almost worth the price of the movie. If you like your action fast and cohesive, don't bother buying this movie. If you have a well developed sense of humor (or an equally well developed sense of irony) and don't mind sitting through the dull parts, or just like collecting cheeseball flicks, by all means, grab it."
3,Gritty Mystery,"This was an interesting, gritty mystery. A little too gritty in places. The travels through the homeless section of town was depressing (the author's intent?). The lifestyle of the gay community was handled in a somewhat cavalier manner, with unnecessary and degrading jokes. The mystery itself was a good one and makes reading this story worthwhile. I especially enjoyed the scenes at the Westminster Dog Show."
1,Ouch...borrring....,"Too slow, lack of action, lack of detail. I've read more exciting text books.I hope this writer has another source of income besides writing, or else she's going to starve."
5,Redressing the stars,"This twofer needs five stars, if only to redress the review that accidentally awarded it one star. It's civil-rights Curtis at his most magical. A seamless, fluid, sweet-souled and heartfelt dreamworld that combined protest, preaching, and a profound love for your fellow-man. A beautiful pair."
1,Recaptured my SOUL,"MADE a Mistake a this is a FIVE star CD. I've been looking for a particular song off this album for some time(Mighty, Mighty).Had forgotten some of the other great songs of this era !!! Curtis Mayfield & the Impressions are some of most prolific muscians of this century. BUY this album. Oops CD."
5,The Good Stuff that we are familiar with,"Jack Zipes usually does excellent compliations of children's stories and folklore, and this is no exception. Most of the time-tested stories with morals that will live forever, along with a few that are not for the squeaminsh and ""politically correct"" characters. The illustrations (some of which are rather grotesque) are from an 1800s edition of ""Fables of Fontaine"" and add to the mood. However, completists will also want ""Aesop-The Complete Fables"" from Penguin Books as a companion piece to this in all their politically incorrect gory/glory."
1,Utterly Baffling,"If you've ever read any of Amy Grech's short horror(?) fiction, you'll find no surprises here - It's simply amazing how someone with no discernable writing skills can be published and/or taken seriously. Her characters' actions and utterances are simply ridiculous, their situations not even remotely believable.If nothing else, Ms. Grech's attempts at writing entrench her firmly in the Bulwer-Lytton school of preposterousness, and many of her misadventures qualify as low-brow humour."
4,Rigorous book,"This book is a classical reference in the subject of stochastic dynamics. It is a graduate level book written in clear and concise language. It covers all the basics about Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations (Chapters 3 and 4). In these chapters, Moyal expansion, Ito and Stratonovich interpretation of stochastic processes is presented carefully. Then they move on to study various methods of solving FP equation in the next 7 chapters. In the final chapter, FP equation and its application to Laser is discussed.I recommend reading this book along with Gardiner's book (Handbook of Stochastic Methods) to anyone who wants to learn about stochastic dynamics seriously."
3,Suspenseful,"If you like good thrillers and suspense then you'll enjoy this movie.Susan Sarandon comes across as a wee bit on the stupid side which I am not used to seeing.All in all a good movie, maybe not Oscar worthy though. lol"
4,Great Movie,"I loved this movie!! I was a little worried at first that it was going to be a bit slow paced and un-eventfull however I was pleasantly surprised at the overall movie. Emily Blunt is a real standout in the film. In fact I have loved every movie I have seen her in so far. If your after a great thriller, then this one wont disappoint."
1,unmatched title for the movie,The film has nothing to show off its name.just the character susan is needed to examplify how wrong the casting for film was made
1,Safi is it Safe?,"I suffer from IBS symptoms and my husband purchased safi for me to try. He can tolerate the taste, but i did not like it, its very strong and bitter and has an after taste of dates. I have only taken the Safi for three days but have not seen any improvements understandably its too earlier to say, but i have become more constipated. Depending on what you want to treat the dosage will vary.It claims to treat, pimples, constipation to depression. I decided to research the product and found that many reviews have stated that it contains high levels of Mercury and Lead that lead to long term side effects. As i am trying for a baby i have decided that it is not worth the risk and have decided to discontinue using Safi.My husband also told me that Safi was banned from UK shelves but wasnt told why from where he brought it from. Possibly because of the Lead and Mercury but its not worth the risk.Also if purchasing from ethic stores the batch date on the product may be extremely old!"
4,Great notebook for price,I bought this item from Curcuit City on 4th July Holiday weekendIt was an open box item that I paid $450 for after rebates + free printer+ free wireless mouse + 18 months Interest free credit. Hard to beat deal.It looks and performs great
2,no original OS disks provided...,Toshiba does not supply the original Microsoft operating system disks with their computers. This is a huge negative! They only supply recovery disks from which you can only revert your system to the way it was on day one.
3,a cute albeit average regency farce...,"I would have given this book a higher rating if not for the wishy washy hero.Every bit a rake, though a kind one-the story starts with you finding out about his THREE mistresses-one of which was a married woman-another a teenaged girl he resced from prostitution, then promptly made his 3rd mistress:(.The author explains all this away ala Oklahoma- with ""he's just a guy who can't say no""-LOL!The book is a series of scrapes by this rake and the vicar's sister, who has always loved him, getting him out. If you don't read this regency as a complete farce then you will not like it.Lastly-I would suggest you by it only if you can get it for very little money:( Otherwise you may want to skip it."
5,Roy is the Best,Our appreciation for Roy Orbison grew 10 fold after watching this a video. Fascinating and factual. I truly believe that he had more talent than even Elvis
5,Great recording of the master of love's angst.,"Difficult to find, this import is a perfect collection of Roy at his best. Lavishly produced with great backup vocals as well, it's the definitive collection of his best."
4,basic smoke box gets the job done..,this is pressed metal. The only issue with this is that once heat hits the steel it warps a bit causing the lid not to be perfectly on. This is where people ask for a hinge in other reviews. But in this design the hinge would not work once heated as it warps too much.
5,Great smoker!,We have been buying smokers for about 18 yrs now. Most don't last more than a season before they collapse and disintegrate. These are holding up very very well. They're more heavy duty than the other stainless steel smokers--but they're not as heavy and cumbersome as the cast iron smokers. We're quite pleased with the product.
3,Ide give it 3 and a half but they dont offer that option...,"This smoker Box is made of decent gadgue metal; nice and sturdy - only problem is that the top cover should have been secured with a long hinge and a latch instead of it just clipping / sliding on. I also wish that It gave off more Smoke flavor in my food; not exactly a smoke cooker just gives minor fklavor. I give it 3 stars because its a good product idea, and good construction, but lacks in the actual ""this is what it does"" catagory. If you want real smoke flavor, go all out and get a buy / make a real smoker. DOn't use the easy ""smoke box on the grill"" way out. Ill try this thing again and give a second review. OGH - AND ALWAYS REMEMBER TO FULLY WET YOUR ASHES BEFORE DUMPING THEM: ""ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FORREST FIRES"""
4,Works Fine,I looked at many different ones and read reviews of as many as I could. This one seems to be a lower cost version. It works just fine. Cleans up fairly easily.
2,nope,i can get ten times the smoke twice as fast from half the chips using foil. IM NOT EXAGGERATING. it looks nice though
1,Renaissance Jewelry,"I was extremly disappointed with this book. First of all it was not at all what I thought it would be. I was looking for something that showed Renaissance jewelry as it was worn or displayed. This book is only a detailed discription of someone's collection of artifacts. To top it all off, the book was listed as ""very good"" quality, but when it arrived, I was appaled at the condition. The cover is torn, but more importantly, the book smelled like it had been stored in someones damp basement. I threw it away and will never order from this vendor again."
2,Short battery life. Suction power declines as batteries go low.,"I used the battery pack that comes with my newly bought pump in style in a long drive from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. It worked fine while we were heading to Philadelphia. However, when we were going back to Pittsburgh, the pump became slower and started losing suction power. I pumped 4 times in total on the road, and it's only 2-hour pumping time. The suction power went so low that I have to use manual pump to ease the pain. I wish I had bought more batteries. My husband bought this vehicle lighter adapterNeneSupply 9V Auto Adapter/Vehicle Lighter adapter for 9V Medela Pump-in-Style Breastpump. It worked great. I just plug in the adapter in the vehicle lighter, and start pumping. I can not tell the difference between using this adapter and plugging the pump into the wall. The power cord is very long, and I can pump at the back passenger seat to take care of my son. I am glad that don't need to gamble on batteries anymore!"
1,Battery pack did not work,It didn't work...even with brand new batteries! Was really dissappointed but didn't have time to complain because of how much time my newborn takes.
5,Works as advertised,"Product works well, does what it is supposed to. No complaints. Would recommend to anyone who needs to pump while out and not able to get an AC wall connection."
5,Works Great,It works great! Saved me from having to buy a whole new pump because my old battery pack was coroded!
2,Bad Advertising,I wanted a 12 volt battery pack so it would be more powerful. This is only a 9 volt battery pack. I wish I knew.
1,Did not work,"Maybe mine was defective, but I used 8 batteries and it died halfway through one sitting. I bought a vehicle adapter and a manual pump and I've used those instead. Pumping in the car is not my preferred option, but it will do."
4,Great!,"This has saved my sanity when flying and laying over in airports with no place to plug in and pump. Awesome! Plus, it actually works better than the normal plug because it's a higher voltage."
3,Many Colors seemed bland to me,"Maybe I read this book with the wrong expectations. I read it wanting to hear about the experiences of multiracial families as I consider adopting children. The book offers brief (usually a page or two) essays on the feelings or experiences of members of each family. While the book introduces us to about 40 different families, the essays seemed pretty superficial to me. I guess one could consider the book a celebration of positive multiracial experiences, but I was wanting to know more about the day-to-day experiences of these families. Maybe as an uplifting picture book you will enjoy it. I didn't get much out of it."
2,Disappointing,I must admit the book was a disappointment to me. The authors appear to attempt to include a diversity of interraical familes yet I found none who were overt Christians. In fact the only references to Christianity I found tended to be negative. It seems like there are no resources for those of us in interracial families who are Chrsitians. I suspect that this is more reflective ... than the actual number of Christian interracial families that do exists.
2,The Fighting Stallion - Bill Edwards,"The Story line to this movie is not bad, but the acting would better classed as C-Grade performances. Bill Edwards acting the part as a blind man was so poor, even his so-called falling scene left a lot to be desired. Quality is very average to say the least. It's only a poor quality video at that, transfered to a DVD-R disc. The video quality has several scrolls, cuts and very jittery in many parts. It is a very cheap shoe string budget made movie, with many fight scenes between stallions, just re-run over and over in sequences. If you love horses, then this movie is ideal for your collection, but not at the $15.00 price tag that i paid, i would wait for a remastered or restored release become available. There's plenty better horse movies around."
3,Heroine likable; Hero lacks integrity,"Arabella made the book worthwhile but she was a little too accepting of Lucien's plan and he treated her horribly. Even five pages from the end Arabella thinks her husband is doing away with her -- doesn't say much for the hero. Despite all this, I did like the book. There were some other additional characters that added life to the story."
3,19th century work,"During the 19th and early 20th century Kabbalism was seen by many as the only legitimate interpretation of the Old Testament. Kabbalism was thought to be ancient mysticism. Through the works of Gershom Scholem and others, we now know Kabbalism was a product of the rabbinic schools in France and Spain in the 11th and 12th century , written as if it dated to the earliest dates of Judaism. This book is an attempt to show how Kabbalism supports and proves Christianity. He has taken sections of the Zohar and for each section adds his mentary on his opinion of the significance. If you are interested in 19th century thought concerning Kabbalism, it is a good reference. If you are interested in Kabbalah history, theory and practice, I would recommend books by Gershom Scholem."
2,Not for everyone,"If you're looking to understand Kabbalah, this is not the book for you. The translation is OK, but there are better versions available. This is like reading stereo instructions in French and you only speak English."
4,Product for a a pet's bad breath,"I have been using this product for over four months and find that my pet who has bad breath and tartar problems, now has good breath and eats the Perio-Support sprinkled on her food with relish. I'm not sure how much her teeth are helped but the breath is no longer an issue!"
4,I'm Not Sure Yet.,"I have an Olde English Bulldogge, with some horrific breath. He's huge, and simply won't allow grooming to be done to him. Something to help his breath as simple as sprinkling powder on his food is a dream come true! So far, it doesn't seem to bother him. He eats it perfectly fine. To be honest, I don't know how well it's helping him yet. From a few of the reviews I've seen, it might take a couple of months to tell.Overall, while I can't vouch yet for its effectiveness, it doesn't seem to be causing him harm. I'll keep using it, and update on his progress."
5,A must have for dog owners,"This is the best dental solution for those especially finicky dogs. I still brush my yorkie's teeth, but the Perio-Support is a MUST HAVE as an addition to a dog's dental care plan. Her teeth and breath are so much better with the daily use of this product. It does not hinder her appetite when sprinkled on her food, plus it is so nice take on vacations to continue her dental health at all times!"
3,Vetri-Science Perio Support,"I've been sprinkling this product on my dog's food using about the amount directed (1 tsp.) for several days. However, I only put it on my dog's wet or moist dog food since that is the type prone to sticking to their teeth. One of my dogs will eat the food with the Vetri-Science on it though I can tell she's not fond of it, while the other dog almost will not eat it until she's very hungry. They are both small dogs and are probably more sensitive to tastes and smells than large dogs.They usually eat dry dog food but I like to give them wet dog food on occasion just to change things up a bit for them and I know they really love it. I will continue trying this product in hopes that the dog that seems to notice it the most will eventually become accustomed to it and will eat her food. I think it's a good idea, to include a form of tooth cleaner/breath freshener if it's safe and really works. I'm still debating about this product right now so that's why the 3 stars."
3,Sounds like a great idea to me ... unfortunately neither the cat nor the puppy agree,"I picked this up on a whim, to see if it would be good for our little animals. I know that this says it's for cats, but other reviewers say they'd been giving it to dogs as well. So, we sprinkled a bit on the cat food and the dog food (sometimes they share anyhow - they seem to be very curious about what we feed the other animal). Neither one, though, did more than nibble at their food. They didn't seem that interested. We use crunchy bits for both of them, and maybe things would be different if we mixed it in with a wet food, but ... I'm not going to change food brands from what they seem to like for this. I'm going to ask the vet next time for an alternative."
4,So far so good...,"I have a Hairless Chinese Crested and a Chihuahua. Both breeds are known for dental problems. Both have already lost teeth even though I have spent hundreds on having their teeth cleaned yearly. Besides having lost many of their teeth, they both suffer from bad breath.I was a little concerned that they would know something was different about their food after sprinkling it on it, but they gobbled it up like normal with no hesitation.After using the Vetri-Science Perio-Support for dogs and cats after a few days I could ""smell"" a difference! My family and I now look forward to those sloppy kisses now. I am curious to see what our Vet will be at the yearly visit in a few months. Hopefully those dental cleaning bills will be a thing of the past."
2,I wish this didn't contain yucca,"I have a 12 year old Maine Coon that has had serious periodontal disease since age 4, despite yearly dentals and monthly pulse therapy with Clindamycin. So I was excited to try this, but once I saw that it contains Yucca Schidigera Extract I won't be giving it to her. This Yucca Extract is also found in many higher-end cat and dog foods and it's used to keep the poo from smelling bad. There have been recent studies that Yucca can raise blood urea levels that can contribute to kidney disease, more likely to happen in cats than other species this is intended for. So I'm not taking any chances; if further studies come out that reverse these findings, I'll reconsider this supplement at that time.NOTE: For those of you who purchase this to help with your dog's/cat's bad breath, please first schedule a vet visit to rule out other causes than ""just"" foul-smelling breath."
3,My cat doesn't like it,"First I should say that if this stuff really works, then it is a godsend. A vet told me I should brush my cat's teeth daily, and I tried it a couple of times. That was enough. I was glad I had had the foresight to don a long-sleeved jacket first.So I got this powder in hopes that it would do what my brushing technique could not. I sprinkled a tiny bit on Goofball's food, and he reluctantly ate some of it, but experiments with two bowls demonstrated that he really didn't like it. He has to get pretty hungry before he'll eat food even lightly dusted with this stuff. We never got anywhere near the recommended dose.Goofball is kind of a picky eater, so I can't fault the product too much, but it didn't really work for us. I have neighbors with dogs -- perhaps they'll like it."
5,great dental support,"I don't brush my dogs teeth and when this was recommended I didn't think they would like it, but they love the taste. I mix it in with their food twice a day. It smells like a seasoning, we will see if it helps. Service was great and got it fast."
5,AMAZING Product!,"We were thinking about having our dogs teeth cleaned, when our vet recommended this powder. We have been using it for about 2 Months now, and people comment on our pups teeth. They are white and clean (and we never brush them). I will continue to purchase this product to hopefully avoid dental problems in the future. Dog LOVES it too!"
1,poor pump,"THis is not the right pump for english bicycles. The picture listed here is a misrepresentation of what is really being sold its alot smaller. If you have an english bicycle like a Raleigh Rudge of Humber then you need the 16"" one. It is very hard to get your tire to the correct pressure with these"
5,Just what i needed!,"This is a compact pump that has a flexible hose on it. I needed an old school style pump to be able to fit between the plastic spokes on our buggy (stroller/pushchair) as had inner tubes with a straight valve, rather than a bent valve & the new bulky pumps didn't fit in. Its lightweight & small enough to carry in the buggy when we are out & about."
5,#1 College Football game ever!,This game is the best college football simulation on the planet!The create a school & dynasty modes are the best! Go University of South Tulsa!
5,This is the real NCAA,"I've been playing Football games since the Intellivision, and this game, to me, represents the realization of all of the things that I've ever wanted to see in a game (college or pro), all in the same game.For instance, I've never seen an effective clock usage algorhythm in any console sports game until this one. Go ahead, set that clock to fifteen minute quarters; you'll get a realistic number of plays, and acceptable realistic stats. You say you want to see the announcers not just make noise, but you want them to say something helpful and relevant? In this game, Corso and Herbstreet just aren't their own persona, they also chime in with topics that are immediately useful to the players.NCAA Football 2003 is a great, great game on a great, great system. Oh and the ability to make your own school is a great feature, so...LET'S GO UNIVERSITY OF DETROIT FOOTBALL!!!"
5,Get Taken to Football Heaven!,"This game is loaded with trophies to win and hundreds of college football teams. My brother got it 2 years ago and still plays it! It has a huge replay value. This game is probably the best game ever for gamecube! There is one bad thing though. It takes up over 200 blocks. But Still, I would pay $100 for this game instead of $70 ($50 for game and $20 for memory card)! It is also very educational. A+++"
4,"Confounding mysteries, and some very funny moments","In this Mason mystery, a client who sleepwalks seems almost certain to have stabbed a guest in his house while sleepwalking. Even Mason thinks he must have done the deed, though he isn't sure if his client premeditated the murder or not. While the list of suspects doesn't seem long, this one is tough to figure out.I call Perry Mason mysteries ""fair mysteries"", in that you have a chance to spot the vital clues at the same time they are presented to Mason. Although that is true of this book, it is not quite as true as most. The inconsistencies that the case's solution hinges on are a bit on the nebulous side until focused on in the wrap-up. For that reason I stingily held back one star.On the other hand, there are literally laugh out loud exchanges between Mason and Sergeant Holcomb, then Hamilton Burger (in his second appearance in the series). I greatly enjoyed this read, and that's what counts."
5,Biz in Harmony,"These two cds were Biz at his best. Goin' Off featuring the vastly underrated TJ Swan and Biz Never Sleeps perfectly captures the Emmazaa-A-R-KIE reaching his zenith. My Man Rich, Biz in Harmony, Things Get Easier, Make the Music, Albee Square Mall, etc. There's probably only two songs maximum that didn't age well between the two LPs. I love all of the monikers that he calls himself on Never Sleeps. To this day I haven't been able to decipher them all. I'd remembered Goin' Off as a classic but for some reason had forgotten about the hidden treasure that was Never Sleeps. It somehow got overlooked during the all Gangsta or all Daisy age of hip-hop. I had to cop this one as soon as I spotted it. A hall of fame cd for a hall of fame artist."
5,Great horror film,"Good story, great score, amazing effects and great spooky atmosphere. Great zombieesque film with a unique infection method."
1,QUELLE HORREUR! !!,"Possibly no one unfrench gets this film because wine is the pride and joy of France. There is a moral to this tale because one maverick farmer sprayed beloved grapes with pesticide which we all know ruins the bouquet. It also makes the village grow rubber gore on their faces and turn them into killers. There is a blind girl saved from this fate- she is spared because she cannot observe the disgrace and also there is a token heroine. Most of the film is spent seeing her being chased and screaming. Then a couple of rather sensible practical chaps turn up who only drink beer.A wine cask comes to life and finishes one of them off. The closing scene - she lets blood drip on her face. "" Spill my blood but not my beer "" as the saying goes in the Uk with "" but not my wine"" in France.Unbelievably this movie is issued in a Special Edition."
3,let's make out with severed heads! :),"Movie starts when some morons are spraying pesticide all over the grapes that are used for making wine. Then the peasents drink the wine (supposively) and slowly turn into psychotic zombies. Then it goes to a woman who jumps out of a train and finds herself in a town filled with zombies and a blind lady. Then she meets two guys who are killing the zombies. Then they go to a house and eat bread, then the chick reunites with her boyfriend in which is turning into a zombie and one of the guys kills him and that idiotic broad kills the guy and the other guy. THE END!Whoever compared this movie to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is a moron. This movie is completely different. It's gore is a bit above average, the story is original and decent. It's very good for what it is, but this movie can get boring from time to time.(some zombies)most entertaining part: when a zombie was making out with a severed head."
3,"A winner, but lacking cohesion and tension - surreal.","Fans of Jean Rollin will not be disappointed. This film capitalizes on many of the staples that make his films unique. There is a pretty gal travelling all over the french countryside facing peril, atmospheric and lingering cinematography, a quirky soundtrack, breasts, a tragic love story, and plenty of surprises to keep viewers guessing. Add the special appearance by the lovely Brigitte Lahaie and you've got a winner, but certainly lacking the cohesion (though wildly subversive and surreal -- though not so bizarre as Jess Franco's pictures) and tension of some of his more successful ventures like La Morte Vivante (The Living Dead Girl), Requiem for a Vampire, The Shiver of the Vampires and others."
3,"Another ""Who-Did-It""","The Phantom of the Red House is one of those old-dark-mansions stories where we try to figure out ""who did it."" The story has a group of people waiting on an inheritance in the mansion and there is a masked villain who is knifing people.I purchased the movie based on the title out of the cheapie bin and for the price was not disappointed. Beware that the comic antics of the private eye tended to be a little nerve racking but otherwise an enjoyable movie."
1,I love Steel pulse but...,Don't bother with this poor quality DVD. You can do better with a homevideo camera. Voice is terribly out of sync. Spend your money on the LifeFrom the Archives DVD. Steel Pulse is about Reggae Music. The DVD needsSteel Pulse rockin' style reggae music. They are the greatest Reggae bandof all times...but this don't make the cut. Word-up.
2,More like a documentary,"Very little music, more so on the history of musical style origins, and opppression. Touching in many ways, this is a history lesson mixed with personal emotions surrounded and layered with roots of the past!"
5,I love this work out!,"I don't know how many fans there are out there for Powerstrike DVD's but I am their number one fan! This work out is INTENSE and fun. You are dripping with sweat and having a blast doing it. It focuses on your lower body, core and legs. After just a couple weeks I felt stronger. I am not athletic and used to hate exercise. One year ago I started doing all the Powerstrike videos I could get my hands on. They have helped me loose 70 pounds! They aren't cheesy. Ilaria the instructor is straight forward and hard core but she keeps you motivated even when you do them over and over. I haven't got bored yet!"
3,bodystrike 2,"As a fitness instructor I find the video very useful, less for a workout, more for the choreography and reviewing this style of kickboxing. Ilaria is amazing. I wish she would put out a video of an actual class she gives at Equinox in NYC, that would be a wonderful dvd to work out to."
5,Nice Movie!!,This is a great movie starring Mark Harmon about the trials and tribulations of a pioneer early American family of sharecroppers.Check it out!!
3,not as well done as earlier (excellent) edition,"My old (1992) edition was getting a bit beat and out of date, so I got this new one. What a pain to use! I still end up using the old copy most of the time. Maybe it's my old eyes, or O'Reilly trying to squeeze everything into one book, but the print is smaller, lighter, and generally harder to read. The bold-faced headings are smaller and less bold. The page headings are smaller and non-bold compared the the actual command headings. Put the old and new editions side-by-side and the new one looks like the output of a laser printer whose toner cartridge need to be replaced. And who thought it was a good idea to divide the critical chapter on commands (Ch.2) into 5 sections? Now there are potentially 5 places to look something up. And opening randomly to chapter 2, one can flip forward and backward alphabetically to the correct spot, only to find you've been in the wrong section.Content: ***** (as usual, O'Reilly books are definitive)Usability: *"
4,New to Unix,"Why did i buy this, for the simple reason as a new user a good comprehensive reference is extremely usefull and handy, and this is it, this is something i will all use or keep close at hand."
3,Yes its like a nut with smaller nut inside,"Based on reviews, I thought this will be the only book I will need for Unix Reference, but I was wrong.Its good price for money though. What else you would expect from $..."
4,Great Reference,"My first UNIX class, the instructor gave this book out. He stated, it was one of the best references he could find. After fumbling around in UNIX, I found myself having the book around as a constant companion. The book is formatted like a dictionary. The commands are on the edge of the page where you can quickly find what you are looking for."
3,"In a nutshell, surely","If you're already comfortable with Unix, but need to have occasional reminders, this is a swell book. It's saved my bacon many times, and is sometimes nice to grab and read while I'm... um... away from the computer for biological reasons. I always come away thinking, ""oh yeah! I'd forgotten about that. What a great idea!""Like any O'Reilly book, it looks good and feels good in the hands, but, c'mon, it's still just a computer book."
1,It's a wast of money. Use the internet if you want a reference.,"OK. This book can teach you NOTHING about UNIX. It's about 800 pages, and 90% of it is just a list of commands, or a list of different options each command takes.If you actually want to learn something about UNIX this book is not for you. This book is just an unorganized reference."
4,A superior UNIX reference book,"This is a very good reference book. I use it almost daily. But it is almost completely useless for the poor novice. It is like a dictionary, which, if you do not know the language, you cannot look up the word, if you do not know what you want to do, you will have a hard time finding the command.If you are a novice and you are stuck with having to work in a LUNIX environment, you should probaby have this book anyway because, eventually, it will become useful to you. Just pick up a good book on shell programming while you're at it. One that provides a lot of examples and is probably somewhat specific to the shell you will be using.I'd have given this five stars, but I don't like the new cover. Search the used books stores for the classic blue cover with the referee."
4,Another great book from O'Reilly,"What can I say, their books are great. I've always found them to be the best out there.Although this is a reference, not a how-to, I had no problems with it as a beginner. With only this book and ""Unix is a four letter word"", I have had no trouble passing my unix class at school. Thats a heck of alot more than I can say for most reference books."
3,Almost as good as ever,"The content of the Kindle edition is the same as that of the printed book, plus (some, could be more complete) hyperlinks between sections.That makes it (one of) the best Unix shell references out there.Sadly the index is all but useless. All commands in the index link to the start of the alphabetical list of commands in the book, rather than the location for the command itself."
4,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...a great overview it isn't, but as a concept album it is great...plus both of the new songs are really good especially ""You Can Make History"" and for those two reasons worth the 4 stars."
4,Elton John Love Songs,A nice collection of Elton John's love songs. Great for Valentines Day or a nice gift fo your sweetheart.
5,Sorry 4U,Sorry for you....If you are missing this music from your collection. It's essential..Truly beautiful!
3,Not my favorite,Elton John is not my favorite vocalist but he does have some very good songs. This CD has some of his best.
5,Great CD,Received the CD in great condition and loved the music. Nothing more to say than I appreciated getting the CD in such a short time.
4,"A little more history, please!!","I have one major complaint about this book--why are there modern words in an ancient language?! Yes, that's right--the author of this book apparently made up words for modern day items or something because there are words for toaster, television, and bus, plus a whole list of ""computer terms"". Then there is the page that shows you how to say all fifty states in Latin. What's up with that? There are some good elements of this book though, like the conversations that are not ""modernized"" (some of them are, though)like the vocab lists of animals and colors, as well as the Roman equivalents of common sayings. Also, there is an explanation of how the Julian calendar worked. All in all, I just wish this book kept more to Roman history and mythology, instead of trying to be (ahem) ""modern"". I love History!!"
2,Only for the intermediate student....,"Unfortunately for me, classes in Latin language are not available at my school. I've always been interested in the language, so I thought that this book would be an excellent independant learning tool. Instead, I found it be extremely confusing. In each chapter, the reader is shown several dialogues, and is then given a list of vocabulary words. That's it! That's the whole lesson! Perhaps a person who has had a few lessons in the language would find it more useful. As for me, I'm shopping for a new reference book."
3,Not limited to Italian cuisine,"David Rocco, a Canadian Italian, returned to his native Italy, and brought us a glimpse of Italian culture, history and of course, doable simple Italian cuisine wherever you are. The original series has some 12-14 episodes featuring all major points of interests in Italy. This compilation unfortunately only covers 3 of the episodes. It's a matter of judgement whether it is valued for your money."
3,Only 3 episodes! :(,I thought there would be more episodes of this wonderful show on the DVD so I was greatly disappointed to find only three episodes!!! Personally I would not have bothered to buy this if I'd know that beforehand.....
2,Not for everyone,"First of all, Blitz 20-03 is a really awesome game...for about an hour. Blitz is an Arcade game, so there is crazy things (late hits, no penalty, 30 yard for 1st down) going all over the place. It sounds really good, but after a while, things get really old, and you will get bored of it really fast! The graphics stayed true to the arcade, and control's perfect. There is no depth to this game, so i suggest try either NFL 2k3, or Madden 2k3. Only get Blitz 20-03 if you havent gotten tired of previous Blitz's."
1,Worst football game ever,I absolelutely hated this game. It is so unrealistic it is unbelievable. If a player lays down on the groun he measures out to be 5 yrds long! What is up with that? The graphics are also no good and the gameplay gets really boring after a while. ...because this game [is bad]!
3,Not as good.....,"Yo, there's only SEVEN tight azz songs out of NINETEEN tracks! That leaves..TWELVE Average or wack azz songs. What the hell is that all about? I'll admit that Screwball has maddd talent, but i don't think they spent enough time on this album. Yo, maybe they came up with these songs all in a week..i dunno..but n-e-wayz...stay up Screwball. Peace."
5,"One Of QB Finest, Queensbridge does it again","Screwball is a phenemonal group of MCees from QB. They been kick it for a long time.Their last album was tight and they came back with a tight street album doing it the QB way.Best believe this is street.Poet lays down the history on ""Bio"". With guest appearances by Cormega,Nature,Kool G Rap, Nore,M.O.P.,Matrix, Tragedy Khadefi and Complexion, this is defiantly one of the best of 2001.Pick this up now. One."
5,Great toaster-oven. Highly recommend.,This is agreat toaster-oven. It is spacious and cooks well. I have had it for a few years and never had a problem with it. It is bigger than the regular counter toaster-ovens and can easily fit a 9x13 pan in it. It cooks well and looks nice. I highly recommend it. It is worth every penny.
4,Countertop oven,Nice oven for the price.So far I have only used it for pizza and it works out well.Beats heating up the whole kitchen like our stove oven does.
4,oven great but convection temperature must be adjusted,"Hamilton beach 31199R countertop oven. Love the oven...Now that I have, thanks to another reviewer, discovered that the oven runs about 50F over the setting on convection, it works great. I simply set the oven for 300F when I want 350F...very easy fix."
1,Junk,I bought this 8 months ago and used it nearly every day. I was put off at first by it's rather flimsy construction and now it has simply stopped working altogether. I would hope that for the money I paid it would last a bit longer than 8 months. Be careful before you buy.
4,Stopped using my regular oven,"I've owned this oven for about three years and have completely stopped using my main oven. It heats up very quickly and cooks faster than conventional ovens. This means it also saves energy, which is very important to me.My one complaint is that when you pull the racks out -- while a pan of food is on them -- they can slip out of place and fall, causing a mess. To remedy this, I just leave the racks in place and pull the pan out instead.I've never tried the rotisserie, so I can't say much about that. But I have successfully cooked pretty much everything else -- pies, cookies, baked potatoes, casseroles, etc...One of the best household purchases I've ever made."
4,"Great item, love it!","My aunt owns this. I got to use it, and it was all she had claimed! Wonderful item, and I'm looking forward to buying one for myself now."
2,The timer does not work,"I like to oven but the time only stays on ""Stay On"". The only way to shut it off is to pull the plug out. This is dangerous because it is behind a hot oven.I sent an email to Today's Concepts on May 14th and they responded on May 18th stating they could not send me a new one until the broken one was in transit and they had a tracking number. A future email was to follow with further instructions on how to send it, which I have not received yet.If you want a copy of their email, I can forward it at your request.At this point, I am not satisfied with the product and am leary on getting another one, as the same thing may happen. I would like a refund because I do not want to go the expense of shipping it back to them and they did not say if I would have to pay for shipping or not.I thank you for an early resolution to this problem. I have purchased many articles through Amazon and this is the first time I have had a problem.Mary Ellen Dorney"
1,Buyer beware for this toaster oven,"Heat escapes because of the warped door. Plus both top and bottom units get hot on all settings. The outside chrome looks cheap and is dented by the red power light above the control knobs. Yet, it does an oven I don't think this oven was satisfactory in any way, and I am returning it"
5,Love my oven!,"Bought this oven about a year ago and i am enjoying it very much! I cook everything in it and the Convection part is really nice as it cooks the food much quicker! Everything about it is good, only slight negative thing, it does get extremely hot on the outside of the oven and the plug gets hot too, so i always unplug after use. Thats not really a big deal.........."
5,It's awsome,Works fine like a commercial one and for a lot of less price. I recommend it because this is my second one.
5,Good as advertised,"Product is excellent. It cooks well, is sturdy, easy to use. I have only had it a short time, so I can't speak to the reliability, but so far I would have to rate it as excellent."
3,"Handy Oven , Needs Space","Hamilton Beach 31199R Countertop 1.1-Cubic-Foot Convection Oven with Optional RotisserieGreat oven, but be careful of the excessive heat. Walls and back seem to be single thickness metal, requiring several inches clearance in all directions. It should not be left under low cabinets when in use. It really is a great oven when used with precautions."
5,Great Countertop Oven,I bought this countertop oven as a Christmas present to myself. I researched for days and definately made the right choice. This is the first time I have used a convection oven and it is great. I highly recommend this oven. Plenty of room for a countertop oven. I will be using it for all my big meals that I can't fit everything in my range and for small meals.
3,Door is warped,"Heat escapes because of the warped door. Plus both top and bottom units get hot on all settings. The outside chrome looks cheap and is dented by the red power light above the control knobs. Yet, it does an okay job if you don't want to use your big oven."
2,"Faulty Knobs, Inaccurate Timer, Bad Customer Service, Awful Warranty Plan","The over works great. Having said that, the oven timer is inaccurate. When you swing the knob to time your meal, is it landing on 15, 17, or 21 minutes? Well, it's all kind of a guess, which equates to your meal being under or overcooked. The timer knob, which controls the power on, can wind out of socket leaving you without an operable oven -- as did mine. And when you call customer service, the hold time is at least 15 minutes, the representatives aren't very helpful, and the worst part is the warranty. They want you to ship the unit back with a check for $24.99. That way, they can ship a new unit back to you at your own cost. You pay shipping both ways, which comes out to be 2/3 the cost of the sale price. What kind of warranty is that??? I highly recommend going digital. At least then the broken knobs won't cost you the entire cooking experience."
3,lovin my oven,"I love my convection oven. I've had it for about 4 months now. It really does crank out the heat, but that hasn't been an issue for me. The only down side is that the numbers have worn off the timer knob. It wasn't from wiping/scrubbing, but just by use. Other than that, can't think of any issues with it. . . . Fast forward to 1 1/2 years of using this oven, having issues now. All the numbers have rubbed off on the timer now and the timer is broken. When we use the stay on, the timer kicks on and won't stop ticking. Very annoying. Also smelled something electrical burning this evening. Not so impressed with it now, was expecting this to last several years, not just a year and a half."
2,Mixed Bag,"How else can a compilation of newspaper columns be anything but a mixed bag. Greene is a decent/good writer who goes back to his Ohio roots in a pinch. But he oftens sounds like a cranky old man without an original thought to his name, let alone a sense of humor. Come to think of it, there is not a single thing funny or ironic in the entire book.Some of his columns are good, some are awful. The poor man feels the only type of tie worth wearing is a striped tie, so sad."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this CD with high hopes. I really enjoy this type of music. Unfortunately these performances fall flat. There's no real life here; nothing to inspire. The notes are played (can't go wrong there) but it feels like nothing more than a standard pops concert -- nice, just nice. Kunzel needs to kick this music into high gear rather than just idling along. Disappointing."
4,Not quite there...,"First, this is a fine collection that is very nicely played by the Cincinnati Pops. The problem it doesn't really excite one's senses. I have heard many of these with various other conductor/orchestra combinations and, frankly, for the most part, I have heard (and own) more spirited performances. They are all finely executed, but, for the most part, they just lie there. There are a couple of exceptions: the first of the Polovestian Dances is absolutely gorgeous and one does not miss the chorus in any way and the Love Theme from ""Spartacus"" sent a shiver up my spine.Please be advised that this is a review of the standard CD version. I have been told that the SACD hybrid is better. But, I doubt it will improve the orchestra's execution (which is already top-drawer) or the conductor's tempos."
2,It doesn't Pedro to advertise,"George Zucco is not at his best in the short thriller. George Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who was shunned and ostracized by his fellow scientists. He must prove himself and get revenge at the same time. So he moves to a secluded house with a secret laboratory. There he lives in seclusion with his daughter Lenora played by Anne Nagel and his hulking gardener Petro played by Glenn Strange.He proves to the world that his theories are sound and swears revenge on those who ostracized him.The moral of this story is do not play with nature or you make get burned."
3,acceptable,"The description said it was black, but its actually blue.Its also *way* too small to hold anything of reasonable size. I had to buy two.Otherwise, it seems to be of decent quality."
4,Good product for a great price,"I wanted something really small that I can put under my bike's seat, but also something relatively strong that I can use to tie things when needed after shopping etc. This net works quite well for that purpose. It even comes with a small reusable plastic bag which is quite useful. The hooks are made of metal, plated with plastic and have rubber covers at the end. I wish they had version with plastic hooks as it would be simpler and more durable."
3,I expected more extra features ....,"It was good to see College Hill do something different. I did like the fact that the college kids were not able to just be on TV. They actually have to work and show how serious they are about making it in the real world. For me, the show seemed shorter than I remember it. Little to no extra features. The day with Soulja Boy was a waste of time for me and that young lady. Soulja Boy reminds me of my youngest nephew, a big kid."
4,"A few changes, but the same great quality","I began buying Blue Ribbon before the 1999-2000 season (when Michigan State won it all), and it is, without a doubt, a must have for any serious college basketball fan. The 2002-03 edition features some changes, though none of them dramatic. First, the traditional Top 40 section was trimmed to a Top 25 to be on a pair with the rest of the major polls, and to have some more space for the new schools that join the Division I this year. Also, the recruiting info is back, with rankings of the top 25 classes for 2002-03, top 200 high school players in the country and top freshmen entering college. The only major blow this year is the lack of the 2001-02 Division I individual statistics, which is, at least for me, a big omission. Overall, it's a great book to buy; it's amazing all the information that contains. It takes me almost half a year to completely read it all."
4,worth reading,i enjoyed this book about another way of life in a rural environment.the family was interesting and i was sympathetic towards them all.it was satisfyingly romantic and funny and touching.it left me with a good feeling about american families.
5,enjoyable book,an easy read yet so enjoyable. be sure to get it and have a cup of coffee as you read along
1,Boring boring boring,"It talk moe a bout the terrain then anything,No storyline, will not buy one of her books againRead half way though and no more a waste of money"
1,This free book will not load :(,"What can I say? This book does not want to load on my Kindle. It sounds like it might be a good story, though."
2,YEAH right!,"This cologne is for SENIOR Citizen dudes.It smelled old,like a pomade,nothing special except its a good cologne for the OLDIES.that's all.So NO i dont recommend this to younger generations unless you wanna smell like your pops and would wanna attract senior ladies as well.."
2,I bought this bcuz of the great reviews :(,"As the heading said, I bought this cologne bcuz of the great reviews it got from so many different ppl. I dont like it! And i dont get any response frm women. The sent is weak and waaaay to musky. All these good comments is a gimmick to sell ppl this crap cologne. I doh use it anymore. I now use I am King from Diddy, its great!"
1,The Dark Before the Garbage.,"I purchased this book after seeing the Author on a Dallas TV morning show and I was really disappointed when I got it. I found that Theresa isn't even a doctor and has no experience in the self-help field, she is just some lady who decided to write a book about healing. Her ability to write about subjects that she has no formal training in, has inspired me to write a book on a subject that I know nothing about like astro physics. And to make matters worse, the exercises contained in the book are pretty much common sense. I don't recommend this book."

5,Great for those who want to tone those flabby arms,"First of all Claudia looked great and there's nothing better than a woman who takes the time to take care of herself. This tape is perfect for those who want to tone up those awful, granny arms. It is a great start to getting in shape. All of her tapes are wonderful. I've enjoyed them all."
5,Great arm workout!,"I have used this tape four weeks now, twice a week with 5 lb. weights, and it still isn't easy to do. My arms and shoulders feel worked! There are three sets of each exercise, which actually work my muscles to fatigue. I really like how this combination of exercises works all three aspects of the deltoids, as well as the upper back, chest and arms. I'm getting ready for summer, none too soon. I'm sure this series of tapes will get me there. (I especially like the legs workout as well.)"
4,Very different type of video,"After doing this workout, I did feel a burn in my upper body muscles the next day. The video itself is very ""artsy"" and mod, not your typical workout video. The moves are very basic and sometimes it looked like Claudia was feeling the burn, too. On some parts, though, it looks like she's losing her form and doesn't control her movements. Overall, it was a refreshing change from typical workout videos."
5,My favorITe!,"If I haven't worked out for a couple months or longer, Claudia Schiffer's Perfectly Fit is great to get back into shape without wrecking your body for the first week. I highly recommend: BUNS, ARMS, & ABS. You will have TONED results. I also LOVE to double run the ABS after 2 weeks! These are a low-impact but, that doesn't mean that they won't give you results. I have limitations on my ankles & minor knee issues. THESE ARE PERFECT for me! I have 2 lb, 3 lb, & 4 lb weights. Start with the 2 pounders, when they become easy- go a poundage up. So you won't be super sore for about 3 days."
1,"Terrible, awful ending....","I cannot beleive I wasted precious reading time on this novel. Did you ever have a book that you wanted to throw across the room after reading the ending?? Well, this book was that one for me.I never connected to Michelle, Mickey or Daisy. I never connected to any of the characters!. Please dont waste yourtime!"
1,Devoid of Subtilty,"I'm surprised that such a shallow, heavy-handed book was considered publishable. From the start, the book pounds the reader with the main character's ""double life"" without a trace of grace or subtilty. It reads like ""young adult"" fiction, except that it doesn't have any likable characters. The one interesting result of reading this book is to see how such a potentially interesting topic like bigamy can be so boring when addressed by an incompetent writer."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"This book sounded intriguing. How could one woman manage to have two husbands? The plot was very shallow, the story unbelieveable. This should have been a paperback that you buy when you can find nothing else to read. This was the first book I have read by this author and it will be the last."
3,not for beginners and a lot of work,"I got this dvd and tried it 3 times. It has section where Neon goes thru movements - this has no music, just voice and her showing the moves. It is in 2nd half of dvd btw. 1st half starts with dancing, I felt just drum is ok but is it really intense and she goes fast! I thought I have to build up technique before I can actually move on to 1st part so I practiced 2nd half which is very boring without the music. by the time I wanted to move on to real dancing about 1 hr passed. and trying next time to start from 1st part made me feel i already forgot how to fine tune the moves. Its just too much pain... then I tried Amira 101 and it is slow enough and I feel like I am doing it right now, the setting and music so much better too. may be later when I am more advanced i will return to Neon. She is excellent instructor but dvd is just composed in weird fashion. Amira will likely become too basic at some point. search continues to perfect belly dance workout."
3,Good Start But Superficial,"While this book has breadth, it lacks depth. I found myself wanting more in almost every section. After 12 years of owning a small business, few of the ideas were of sufficient detail to be of real use. For example, we rely on the Yellow Pages for 10-20% or our new customers. I would have liked to see an entire chapter on this topic, not two pages."
3,Provides the basics for beginners,"This is a very good introduction for novices, but leaves out a very important factor. Whatever you are marketing, nothing replaces letting your audience know who you are, what you have to offer, and why they should look to you for products, service or advice. This is ""personal publicity,"" and it is a must in today's highly competitive marketplace."
3,I Can Dig It,"Sometimes these rainy day mystery novels are so contrived, I can't handle them. But this one works, despite the fact that it follows genre formulas: an eccentric protagonist, a slew of silly suspects, a convoluted murder plot full of red herrings, a surprise ending. There is enough wit, suspense, and novelty in ""Dig"" to keep you turning the pages. I'm looking forward to more."
5,CR Corwin is the best living mystery writer!,"Corwin's latest, ""Dig,"" is a riveting read, with well-developed, true-to-life characters, swift pacing and an arresting plot. My favorite character is police Detective Scotty Grant, who tries again to frighten our heroine, Maddy Sprowls, off the case. In this installment, Maddy feels compelled to look into the murder of one of her old and dear friends, making it a heartwrenching puzzle. Making this probe even more daunting is the fact that the list of possible suspects include many of her other old friends. Maddy operates in this yarn pretty much alone, making the investigation scarier in many respects. Corwin's prose is delightful, and the observations and descriptions are often scathing and hilarious. I comment ""Dig"" to everyone who loves a good mystery!"
3,Entertaining enough,"I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first Morgue Mama book. Perhaps some of the newness of the character wore off. For some reason, too, I grew irritated at the author's repetition at one of Morgue Mama's traits. It seems like she does an awful lot of ""pawing the air"" in front of her.One of its strongest elements is its insights into the behind the scenes workings at a newspaper, especially in this day and age. The author is dead on with his descriptions.All in all, a light and entertaining enough read."
3,Love Jimmy Martin,"There was not enough music in this video for me. He did so many songs, would like to have heard much more."
4,Jimmy Martin King of Bluegrass,I only ordered vhs because I had tried to get a DVD for weeks and the order was cancelled. The Vhs tape was of good quality and came on time.
5,\m/ \m/,"i saw Origin live a few days ago, and they really brutalized the assemblage! >:] I bought the record there, and it was still stunning ...when i got home to listen to it, like i never left the show :) Their sheer power just takes over everything in a vast hellfire leaving destruction and terror in their wake! yes, seriously! mwahahahaahahah! These guys are highly skilled and they will carve you up... hehehe... but yeah, if you have not bought it yet, DO IT! NOOOOOOOOWWWWW! it's for your own good, really ;) also, look for them on tour with Hate Eternal and Nile."
4,Totally insane!!!,"Insane speed, insane drumming, insane sweep picking, insane drums!!! Ultra fast technical death metal for true metal fans."
5,There is nothing like it,"If you like any kind of metal music, this recording with reset your standards. And if you happen to be a drummer, you won't hear anything close to this on any other recording, it's absolutely ripsnorting! Musicianship from every bandmember is topnotch in every aspect. The song ""Portal"" has become my alltime favorite death-metal song, it's intensity defined."
5,death/Grind assult!!,Origin's infinitas inhumanitas quite a funny title but the music is far from being fun or funny...Straight assult in your ears with nonstop pounding excellent drumms and amazing vocals--topnotch. Still one of my favorite extreme bands yet!! For any one that loves pure brutallity and shredding type of drumming. Worth it!!
5,A SONIC BARRAGE OF INHUMAN PROPORTIONS,"WOW! This year i've heard some excellent death metal but this has to be the best of them all. Classic death metal fans into Death and Carcass will be slightly disjointed at Origin's immense speed. I can't highlight enough how fast it is, suffice to say it nearly competes with Cryptopsy in the clinical and technical stakes (and thats some going). The best thing about this lp is that the vocalists growl are immensly fast as well. They complement the music brilliantly, sometimes you find fast death coupled with slow growls, that is unengeretic and leaves you wanting more. This however is one of the most brutal and accomplished death metal cd's i own. To understand how they sound imagine the (...) child of Deeds of Flesh and Cryptopsy, but speeded up and brutally tortured. The reveloution starts here!p.s - Their debut eclipses this, just."
5,Amazing,"My first exposure to origin was when they were on the pain cometh tour with cryptopsy. They were nuts live. I bought their cd that night and loved it. I have been waiting for this release for over a year and it was well worth the wait. The 2nd time I saw them live was with vader and impaled. There were no guitar theatrics on the first disc but when paul Ryan was warming up he was playing steve vai`s solo from crossroads! After the show asked why he doesnt solo and he said it doesnt really fit but if you listen to portal on this cd he does a crazy sweeping lick. There are also plenty of sweeps in the riffs. This cd is hyper technical and super brutal. The track perversion of hate is about osama bin laden. Johns drumming also is insane as usual. Standout tracks are(all songs on here rule):larvae of the lie,portal, mental torment II and meat for the beast."
2,Virtuoso monotony.,"Yeah they're pretty darn fast, that's for sure. But all they seem to know is one tempo. The guitars sound a bit washed out and are rather difficult to decipher half the time. This is on par with Hate Eternal's Counquering the Trone -- another monotonous hyper blast beat.For virtuoso metal with MUSICALITY, VARIETY, UNPREDICTABILITY, and GRIND, stick to Suffocation, Dying Fetus, Broken Hope, and Cryptopsy. Don't waste your time with this speed-for-the-sake-of speed drone."
5,Awesome,"One word: Relentless. With the drummer using one-handed rolls, constantly using 2 ride cymbals, and never a period of more than 3 seconds without his double footed bass drum rolls (about 584 beats in 30 seconds!), this cd is speed/death metal at its best. No doubt. The vocalists are not your regualar death metal screamers; they consistently change the rhythm to their screams instead of the normal ""scream on count"" style. If you love hard, fast metal, I would really recommend this CD."
2,Overrated and boring,"The only reason you should even consider buying this is if speed is all you look for in death metal. It's all thats on offer; no memorable songs, just a constant barrage of blastbeats. John is, quite frankly the only thing to write home about this album.Get Anomalies instead; god knows why amazon puts it alongside this over-hyped garbage."
1,"Guys, please...","Try to create some memorable Death metal songs instead of cranking out nothing but incoherant psychotic ramblings accompanied by a drummer who thinks that all there is to metal is to blast out as many beats as possible per minute. What the Hell is the point in being brutal and extreme if all the songs sound similar to one another? The only thing I hear in these DM circles is how fast and brutal and technical and extreme some of these band are. Sure, that's a good motive to purchase something. Buy it because it's brutal and extreme and technical. That's a gimmick if ever I've heard one. I swear, those have become some of the biggest buzz words in Metal. Well, I'll leave you with these thoughts and go back to listening to Immolation's ""Close to a world below"" for my extreme metal fix. Check that band out if you want to listen some meaningful extreme metal that doesn't fall into repetition."
5,BRING IT ON,"BLITZ ROX!!! Period. End of discussion. Yeah, you can play all those other games, but why? Simply why? Sure let's play-CRACK WHAM BASH!!! I like that much better."
3,Ehh,"The book itself was a print-on-demand book. I could tell from the lack of quality of the pages and the fact that there was a small page at the end of the book that said it was printed on the day I bought it from amazon.As for the story, it was slow to begin with. It definitely picks up at the end, but I found the writing style lacking (there was too much telling and not enough showing, especially in the beginning).Overall, the book wasn't bad, especially for a younger reader. But I have a feeling that many people like it because they read it as children first."
4,It was a great book.,"It was a great book.It was very sad but, very interesting.This book is a page turner.I really felt like I was write there next to her."
1,Ice,"Chrissa's mom wanted her to go to her Grandma's house ,then she went to church with her grandma and the preacher tried to pull a scam but Chrissa prevented that and started babysitting to past the time and she was asked to stay late one day and a Ice storm started happening all at the same time someone broke in to there home and Chrissa led the kids to safety. Well I disagree with the way she made Chrissa seem. She madeher seem like a weak fragile person. Chrissa is a really storng person,she rescued those kids didn't she? She also made Thad seem like a country boy he wasn't that country. Yes I do reccomend this book to people who like action-packed adventures. This book has a lot of action in it.Also if you like a little mystery there is that too in this book.This book doesn't desevre a Newberry Award but it is okay."
3,Compendium of the field,"This book systematically goes through the theory of Quasi random sequences. It is a very nice compendium of the main results, and contains a few interesting insights. But don't expect much in terms of intuition about the results, and what is more important for a field that borderlines theory and applications, any solid examples or such references. But don't despair. Mandatory only if you are looking into using theory results from the area."
4,A Great Read for Fans of the Jane Roberts (SETH) Books,"I REALLY enjoyed this book!! I have read, and re-read, almost all of the SETH books, and have shared themwith many friends. They have found the SETH books to be very insightful, and ""a must"" for people who areseriously on the spiritual quest. However, I had always wanted to read a book, written by someone whointimately knew Jane Roberts, and had ""been there"" during some of the critical times. This book truly filled thatneed!! For me, it was great! I am very glad I selected it."
1,Really not worth it.,I really do regret purchasing this. Poorly written with the author going on and on and on about herself and trying desperately to associate herself with Jane Roberts. It was torture reading this.
2,Jane who?,"I was disappointed with this book. I learned more about Sue Watkins than I did Jane. Frankly, I don't believe that Sue really knew Jane that well to think that she could write a book about her. I read 1/4 of the book and put it down never to open it again."
4,LOVE IT!!!,"Ann J. Bishundayal along Chubby Tavares takes fans through the wonderful and turbulent years of the talented family group Tavares! Also known as Linda and the Delrios, the Realities and Chubby and the Turnpikes, the handsome and talented Tavares brothers thrilled audiences with thier wonderful harmonies and exciting stage shows. As a die hard Tavares fan myself, I loved looking into their private lives, I laughed and cried as I read about their personal joys and heartbreaks. My ONLY complaint is that I wished the pictures were in color, but that is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars!Tavares, if you're reading this....YOU ARE LOVED AND MISSED TERRIBLY! In this world of Brittney Spears, sound alike boy bands and violent, sexist hip hop, Tavares will always hold a special place in my heart!Ann and Chubby....Thank you so much for the book!! Movie next??"
3,This isn't the 70's anymore!,"I had to get this book for my foods class at school and even though this is a new edition, the pictures are from the 1970's!! The publisher's and authors need to take a look at their datebooks because the rest of the world is heading into the 21st century! With all the new technology out there, the book should contain up to date pictures of foods and meal presentations. I'm very disappointed in this books presentation of food. The only reason I give the book 3 stars is because the information is useful."
2,disappointing,"I was hoping for a factual/investigative account of the tragedy of the Atlanta child murders. Instead, this book seemed to be an essay written on the problems of racial injustice and ignorance in Atlanta, America, and the world. Nothing wrong with that, but then I take into account that the essay was written in a most meandering and disjointed fashion, full of incomprehensible references, with an overwhelming tone of arrogance. Baldwin is right, everyone else is wrong and to blame. Not persuasive, just a waste of time."
1,Really not worth it.,"This product sounded so good, but boy does it lack. Of the three DVD's that all claim to be 50 minutes, one is 38 minutes with a lot of filler, and another is 42 minutes with some filler. Although some of the costumes and scenery are nice, the quality of the filming is poor. This all could have been done with less filler on one DVD and it would have been more enjoyable. As it is, when they tried to stretch each topic to try to fill up close to half a DVD, the lack of organization and the excess filler made this set a really big waste of money. The studio needs to edit out the filler and release it again on one DVD for less than half the price to even come close to making this worth watching."
5,Succinct and Useful Guide to Warm Hospitality,"Over the last three summers our family has used this guide to arrange accomodation, staying in Bed & Breakfasts from Oslo to Lofoton. We have met wonderful and interesting people at all seven of our choices and would be hard-pressed for a favorite, although Trabakken in Verdal and Skartnes Grd in Snsa are very special to us. The guide is user friendly with both maps and indexes. Each page has a sketch of the accomodation, rating, prices, contact information, and description in Norwegian, English and German. Email addresses and telephone numbers make advance reservations easy. This guide offers a personalized and far less expensive way to travel."
5,The Pastry section alone is worth it!,"The paragraph on making pastry such as pie shells, etc., is worth the price of this book. Without a doubt, the best explanation of why you do this and why you do that together with the options of using various fats and the results that may be obtained with each. This is the book your mother or grandmother grew up with, having been first published during WWII. It is a book that belongs in the kitchen of any person who loves or lives to cook."
2,Not impressed by this book,"In 1992 both ""Enterprising Women"" and ""Textual Poachers"" were published. Not just one, but two important books published about media fandom? Wow. We had arrived.Enterprising Women: Television Fandom and the Creation of Popular Myth (Contemporary Ethnography)Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture (Studies in Culture and Communication)At that time I had been in fandom just under 20 years. Like many others in fandom, I eagerly read both books.Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed by this book. Page after page, I shook my head in disagreement and wrinkled my brow in perplexity of the how-did-she-reach-*that*-conclusion variety. It simply did not represent my perspective of or participation in fandom, then or now.I've read the book more than once since its publication, seeking to see if my view on it has changed, and it never has.(On a related note, ""Textual Poachers"" has always engendered the opposite response in me.)"
3,Interesting,"I think people could be surprised at how much fanfic, esp on the Internet, can mean to people. Let alone that it was a big enough topic for people to write books and scholarly essays about! Could be something of a surpise, esp if you had no idea so many people enjoyed this hobby."
4,Good except for the finish,"The weight and feel of this is great. I've had one of these for a few of years as part of a set. My only issue is the urethane finish that they use, which breaks down over the first year and flakes off, and it looks pretty bad after that.After the second year I just sanded down the remaining finish and refinished with Tung oil, which brought back most of the color, and holds up much better than the original finish."
3,finish peeled off handle,"In just a couple of weeks of normal use, the heat from the grill plus washing it in the sink caused the finish to come off of the lower one third of the handle. It looks crappy but works fine still. Given the nice weight and balance and the very long handle, I would otherwise have given this item five stars."
4,Women note,"I got this for my wife. Because of how it is situated on the gun, it makes it a bit more difficult to rack the slide and women may want to take this into account if that is an issue. (I believe CT makes a differently placed version which alleviates the problem.) That said, terrific product, results in her shooting more accurately and no complaints except as noted."
5,Crimson Trace Lasergrip is Awesome,"Mounting is easy. Zeroing it in, like really zeroing it in at your distance of choice takes a box or two of ammo, but once it is zeroed in, man it is great. Using the Lasergrip lets you focus completely on your target acquisition, breathing, stance and tigger squeeze. If you are flinching, you'll know."
5,Very helpful...,"I bought this based on the reviews on here and I have to admit, it works as advertised. It took a few magazines to get used to it, at first I thought it was way off but somehow my head was messing with my trigger pull and shots were going everywhere. I'm used to squeezing my trigger and using my eye to keep the sights straight I guess. It works pretty well, was soon putting together some pretty tight groups from the waist and left handed. I still need some practice but I can see where this thing could save my life. Plus it's nice to know you could avoid shooting somebody and maybe just ""deter"" them when they see this bright red dot on the chest...It goes on a minute, really easy. Well made too. My only complaint it that is adds some width to the gun and a slightly larger bulge when carrying concealed but it's OK - I'm keeping it."
5,This masterpiece has reunited me with my childhood dreams,I read this book as a young child in Pennsylvania. I am now the mother of two beautiful daughters and would like to share with them my love of nature and reading with this touching book. I fell in love with those two raindrops over 30 years ago and now I will help my girls find their connection with nature through your heartwarming book.
1,A mixed bag...,"This CD is a mixed bag. One or two songs are actually OK, but most are not up to snuff, and a couple just plain suck! The mix of old and new doesn't work. It sounds contrived and doesn't have the right vibe."
4,Great product for the price,I bought this game for my 3 year old boy and he won't stop playing it. I encourage everyone to buy this game for the price you can't go wrong
2,buy only if very short on time,"this book if very brief (it offers no more information or instruction than that provided in the lsat registration booklet that comes with your test application). the sample questions for the analytic section are much easier than those on the lsat, but the logic questions were about the same difficulty. if you only have a few days to prepare, i guess this would be a good choice since it is a quick read, but if you have more time, i recommend barron's pass-key instead. FYI: don't take the december lsat, i did and everyone had a cold and was coughing and sneezing and blowing their noses and it was impossible to concetrate--it was a nightmare!"
2,It was ok but lacked variety,The books monologues were aimed at people in there 30's and 40's. I was hoping they would be aimed at my age group which is the 20's and 30's. Maybe some day I will find something that suits me.
2,Width is the problem,"20 OctThe leather is fine; so is the style. However, I got an 8 1/2 wide Naturalizer Women's Fuller loafer and the shoe is wider in the heel than toe. The heel looks bulky and slides even with adhesive pads inside the heel."
4,J-Light looks a bit like a lamprey.,I have already written an extensive review of the Zelco J-Light; please find it at this URL: http://ledmuseum.candlepower.us/tenth/j-light.htmI am *NOT* a professional product reviewer; it is only a hobby.
4,Santo American Style,Afficionados of lucha libre cinema will enjoy this rare example of El Santo dubbed into english and americanized as Samson. Since the spanish language original is equally available this version might be considered for completists only. Nonetheless the old-fashioned B+W atmosphere and awkward dubbing lend this picture a nostalgic charm. The dvd features only the film and chapter divisions.
2,Bilge Pump Switch Doesn't Match Schematic,"The schematic of this bilge pump did not match the actual wiring of the pump switch at two locations.The directions included schematics for several bilge pump switches and none of them matched the actual switch.I was able to deconvolute the switch using a VOM meter, but the double pole switch still appeared to work in only one position.In my opinion this is a complete breakdown of quality control."
4,"Works well, panel a bit flimsy","I installed this panel to control a Rule mate bilge pump. Everything worked well. The only complaint I can find is that the metal panel is flimsy. It is aluminum and a bit thin, and there is very little space around the electrical components to mount the panel satisfactorily. I have a couple of other panels on my boat, and they are made of thick strong plastic, with more mounting holes, and there is more space around the controls, which can be used to make the panel mounting operation a little easier. This panel switch is usable, the electrical design is fine, but the panel design itself could be better."
5,"WOW 7disc set, 24 episodes",WOW this is an entire season of 24 episodes from the first season including the 2 hour first episode. I saw all of these when they originally came out but have forgotten them and it's good to see and enjoy them again without the commercials.
5,Matlock Lover,"Matlock - The First SeasonI love watching Matlock, even if I have all ready seen the show lots of times. It's great to have it on DVD finally, now I am just waiting for season 2, 3, 4, etc. Love It!"
5,Matlock Season 1,"Andy Griffith has been a household friend for over fifty years. Sheriff Taylor was laid back. Ben Matlock gets mean at times, but it's for the right reasons (most of the time), but we still love him for his sense of justice. Our home is always open to Sheriff Taylor and Ben Matlock."
3,Wonderful Show... Where's the upgrade,For all fans of Matlock this is a must buy the Picture quality is just down right terrible. I hope for the rest of there series they improve the quality of it and about about some bonus features!
3,Bad DVD case for Matlock Season 1,I was really disappointed with the case for The First Season of Matlock which I bought for my sister. The case design is really poor and isn't very durable. I have never seen a design in a DVD case that was so fragile and I was afraid will break soon. I sent the first one I received back because the first DVD was loose and the middle section with the other DVDs was broken. The second one I received the first DVD was loose because the holder was broke again (doesn't take much) but I kept it anyways and just have to be extra careful with that season. My sister has been enjoying the episodes on the season now thou.I also bought the Second Season and it looks like the design is better and acceptable.
3,"Interesting show, but frequent language","Matlock is a great murder mystery show, but my main complaint is the language from many of the main characters especially Andy Griffith. If you forgot how much language is in this DVD and it offends you (like it does me) then DON'T buy this!The language is frequent and sometimes several times ""Matlock"" will use the same offensive word in a sentence. This is NOT something I will sit down & watch with my kids."
1,I expected better from Paramount,"I was originally very excited to hear that this set was goingto be released, because my parents really enjoyed this series.I bought this as a present for my mom's birthday. After muchresearch and reading many reviews, I have decided to return it.The main reason is that my mom is hard of hearing and I expectedthis set to have english subtitles at the very least. I havelearned that it does not. It does have closed captioning butmy parents tv does not have this capability.I was going to keep it for myself but after reading about the poorpicture quality in these reviews, I have changed my mind.What is the purpose of buying a dvd that is no better than regulartelevision or vhs?"
4,All time Favorite,"I'm old school - All the new programming does not interest me at all! But I have Roku as well - I can watch series like Matlock, Poirot, Murder She Wrote, Colombo all I want."
5,love all the Matlock CD's,Can't beat Andy Griffith and the shows can be watched over and over and enjoyed for so many reasons. Each CD great
2,New computer users beware,"I bought this as a gift, what a waste of [money]. PLUSshipping and handling. The CD does not work on newer computers. I've tried it on two, but put it into MY old computer (486) and it worked. Now unless I want to give my other computer as a gift as well it can't be used for the person intended. Seems a waste of money for just workbooks and flashcards. I'm deeply dissapointed in this product."
2,Disappointing,"I went into this movie expecting to see gorgeous naked Asian women, and for the most part that's what I got. However, I feel it is worth mentioning that the phenomenally gorgeous Amy Yip, while appearing nude, does not actually show anything. She is always conveniently covered. I understand that she is somewhat well known for this (called ""Yip Tease""), so if you want to see her naked, you will have to look somewhere else. Of course, there are several other gorgeous women who are not so demure, so if that's what you're looking for and don't care whether it's Yip or not, I recommend this video."
2,Caution - Item not as pictured,"Product arrived promptly but was not as pictured. I was very disappointed. Specifically, the product that was received did not have the bright blue elastic or the designs that were pictured, instead a more common Thomas product that my son already owns was received. Very disappointed buyer. I would not have paid this price for the item received."
5,I Am Now A Big Boy!!,"I simply bought these because my grandson loves anything Thomas the Train. My daughter is pleased because he wasn't quite potty trained,.. but since wearing these,.. ""Big Boys that wear Thomas Undies do NOT potty in their pants!"" All it took, was Thomas on his underwear!! :)"
5,Hanes Thomas Undies,These are great for my toddler son who has always been at the top of the growth chart. The Hanes brand fits him really well. He loves the Thomas illustrations. They're 100% cotton and really durable. Good buy.
5,Thomas Toddler Underwear,"These items fit my two year old great. Often, underwear is too big, even when sized the same, but these fit great, and he loves the Thomas design"
4,"Very nice briefs, but tags are scratchy",The briefs are very nice and my 3 year old son really enjoys wearing them. The only problem we had was that the tags were very scratchy and were causing irritations on my son's back. I ended up removing the tags and now they seem to be fine.
5,Durable,They fit my son perfectly and my little one dropped a pair into the toilet after I poured bleach into it...they retained color!!! Talk about durable!!! They are also too cute!
2,great product but shipping fees too expensive!!!,"the product is nice quality,but you could probably find them at target and save the shipping costs. you are not saving any money when you order these underwear through amazon!!"
2,sizing off,These were too tight around the waist and too long in the in the downseam. They hang down so low past his butt that they make shorts uncomfortable to wear over them. Just too saggy in the bottom area and too tight in the waist
5,LP is a rock star,"No CD is going to fully do justice to the quality of LP's voice. You've got to see her live--she's got an awesome stage presence and her vocal range and control is stunning--that girl is LOUD. That said, Heart-Shaped Scar is the next best thing. ""Coming Home"", ""Shut You Out"", and ""Insane"" are great songs--not like anything I've heard before. I'm a sucker for great vocalists and LP sings like some of the folks I've seen on Broadway. Thank God she's rock and roll, though--we need an injection of true talent in modern music with all the crap that's out there now. BUY THIS ALBUM--SEE THIS BAND LIVE--you will be floored."
3,Where's the music?,"Although this book contains many tracks from the film, the tracks are rather heavily excerpted, with 10 minute tracks like ""The Battle"" and ""Barbarian Horde"" often being cut down to only 2-3 minutes. The creators of this sheet music attempt to disguise this by making the music in very large type.What's there is good, but there isn't nearly enough."
5,A Very Happy Christmas,"I wasn't sure if I made the right choice when I purchased this product having not seen it in person, but having done a lot of reading & research on Go-Karts over the Internet I decided to make a purchase. Well, let me just say, this product is quite ""unbelievable"". Not only does it look awesome, but it really moves fairly quick too. Both my boys (9 & 11) have been riding up and down the street on this for the past 2 days. In fact, the only thing stopping them staying on it now is the snow. Do yourself and your kids favor, pick up this Go-kart, you won't be sorry, neither will your kids."
1,Fun to ride but didn't last long. by Alec 10yrs old,"When mey parents got this kart for my by birthday I was thrilled. I rode it everyday until it wouldn't go in reverse. Minimoto sent a steering wheel with switches that didn't fix the problem. After my dad took the kart apart he found that the disc brake was stopping the shaft from turning. Minimoto shipped us all new brake parts. This happened twice. Also the motor gear wore out. They had to ship us a new motor. This happened before the 6 month warranty was up. After 9 months the ""T"" handle that disconnects the electric from the engine melted. I pulled it out and got burnt. Minimoto took the kart back and gave us a full refund. I want a gas kart now. Don't buy this piece of junk."
1,A DREAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,mine kept on stopping and going whick led to a frustrating ride.It only last to an hour. your better off with a gas go kart
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING,"Nfl blitz 2003 is the worst game boy advance game i have ever played. For starters, the graphics are awful. You cannot really tell that tell the football players from the football. Also, the game is very shakey, you cant really tell whats happening. I have the other fallowing games: Lord of the Rings the two towers, Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets, RAinbow six rogue spear,bomberman max blue version, advance wars, castlevania circle of the moon, MLB high heat 2002, and as you know, nfl blitz 2003. None of these other games have near the graphical problems like this one."
4,unedited?,"WARNING The import version of Cloud Patterns isn't unedited, it gets its extra nine minutes from a radio interview that's been tacked on the end as a 'hidden' bonus.In its favour, this import does include the non-domestic track Spicy Snapper, and the extra disc is pretty good too."
5,hot fun in the summertime...,"Gotta love Summer CD's -- In 1999, it was Groove Armada. Last summer, it was Dimitri from Paris, this summer it's going to be Ian Pooley. This is the feel good CD for the summer of 2001. Go poolside with a frozen drink, and dance your mind away."
3,"Well, not actually *that* great","True, Ian Pooley serves up some infectious beats here. The Latin take is great (and is way snappier than your usual Thievery Corp lounge). But Ian doesn't move his tunes along well--he creates a nice catch, but then repeats the bejeezus out of it. ""Coracao Tambor"" is a great tune, but ""Bay of Plenty"" and the Intro are just stripped versions of it, and by the time you get to the end of the real song you might have had enough. The rest of Pooley's songs are set up the same way--you really will have gotten all of the songs in their first minute.Sorry to those Ian Pooley fans out there, but I don't think this one was worth the cash."
3,very repetitive at times,"this cd is not 5 stars material as reviewers suggested, the music does get very repetitive at times and it even becomes boring if you just sit there and listen. tracks like Venasque,900 Degrees,Sundowner repeat almost the same line over and over.however the positives just outweight the negatives as what saves the album are tracks like ""Coracao Tambor"" a nice brazilian dance tune ""since then"" a soothing chill peace same thing here with ""cloud patterns"" ,""Menino Brincadeira"" a slow latin dance track with soothing vocals And the song ""Balmes"" which is soothing tropical dance tune, watch out for the vocal version of this song called ""better life"" its even better.you may be familiar with some of these songs as they were used in fashion runaway shows as the repetitive music makes decent ambient but for the average listiner its not for everybody i suggest to listen before you buy."
2,Great visuals but dated and ill-focused.,"We didn't find this video particularly useful. It is dated and not very informative. The visuals of the outdoors are stunning but we knew this about NZ already from everything else we read and from that tiny, independent film series called Lord of the Something or Other.What we wanted was less about the obvious tourist traps (panning for gold, I mean, c'mon) and more about the people, the cities, and life in New Zealand. Skip this film or, if you want to watch it, do so with the sound off -- and then fast forward through all the zooming helicopters and airplanes as they soar a la Magnum PI over bluffs and glaciers."
3,"Good, but could have done better","Although I would recommend this insightful documentary, the creators could have gone a little deeper inside the Holy See to film the laberynthine Vatican City. I'm sure some of the age-old departments would have been restricted, but certainly there is more to the Vatican than the footage you will see in this DVD. With the exception of a few segments, the creators simply filmed what has- for the most part - been seen by the public in media footages and other documentaries. If you've never watched a documentary on the Vatican, this DVD is for you. If you have previously seen Vatican documentaries, this would be a redundancy in your DVD collection."
5,Inside the Vatican - An Excellent Buy!,"An excellent film showcasing the splendor that is the Vatican. Sit back as National Geographic takes you on an ""All Access Pass"" through the halls of the Vatican. See the important pieces of art and how they are restored and protected, visit the workshop of the Swiss Guard where you will see a uniform made...the very same way they were made many years ago. Martin Sheen narrates this fantastic journey...it is quite simply a must have!"
5,One of the best books I ever read!,Goodnight Kiss: collector's edition is one of the best books I read. I am only 12 and both books sort of continue where the other one left off. The end of both of them are both very suprising and the new story is still awesomeeven though its only a few pages long. If you like vampires then you will love this edition but if you like more muder mysterys then I reccomend that you get Truth or Dare by R.L. Stein. That is the best book in the world!
1,Not one of the best,"This book, unlike any of the other R.L. Stine books, lacked the suspense that they usually have. Most of the topics he writes about are to do with real things, and vampires just don't seem real enough to scare many of us."
1,One Of R.L's worst ever,"This book was phony and unreal. All of his books are a little far-fetched but this was rediculious. I mean who would belive that vampires run aroud trying to make them like, Etrnal."
4,Better than Roberts,"Wow. My wife is hooked on the ""traditional"" romance style books (Nora Roberts, Fern Michels etc). Meanwhile, we both got into Laurel K. Hamilton a couple of years ago and discovered we mutually enjoyed the paranormal aspect. Rather than continue to buy Nora ""gag me"" Roberts, I searched for more along the paranormal line and came across Lyndsey Sands, Katie MacAlister, Kelley Armstrong and others. This being my first foray into Katie MacAlister's humor, I was in stiches. The ""fake"" vampires and the homage to Feehan (even though I've never read her I've read enough reviews to know a homage when I see one). I had to put the book down everytime Joy mentioned her ""cheerleaders."" It was a nice, quick and entertaining read for those interested in the paranormal side of ""romance."" I'm getting into ""Sex and the Single Vampire"" and now I'm eager for ""Even Vampires Get the Blues."""
3,The reiveiw of a 20-something...,"Tihs book was really funny, but the main character spent so much time beating around the brush with ""Is he or isn't he a vampire ? Hmm, I dunno rather than *ask* him I'm going to just rant on about my friends lifes,and think about the series of romance books books he reminds me of.. ."" moments that lasted nearly wholechapters that I never did finish it :P.Good if you want something that tries to make jokes about other vampire romance novels, bad if you want this book to be a good romance novel *in of itself*.I'm sorry, but if I saw a guy that good looking I would spend my time *getting to know him* and other things, not thinking about romance novels.."
2,Not so good...,"I like vampire romances, but could live without this series. The Roxy chick is about as annoying as they get,I would abandon her in a foreign country in a heartbeat. The story drags on and two-thirds through the book I had enough and skimmed to the end. I read the second book in this series first. It was a little better than this one, but once again I skimmed through to the end."
4,Does the job!,"First off, let me say that I don't usually read romance novels and this is the first of Katie MacAlister's books that I have read. I enjoyed it. The main character was relatable and I loved the opening scene in which Joy and her bff were having their fortunes told by their Wiccan friend. It seems that MacAlister has done her research; the parts dealing with occult seemed accurate. The love scenes were *hot* and MacAlister kept em coming (no pun intended) every 75 pages or so. Now, I do think this book fits the bill but we must keep in mind that it is a ROMANCE NOVEL. Sure, some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy at times, but most of it was witty and well written. Sure, the main character meets her soul mate the very first day of her vacation (don't we all?) Great American literature it is not but for what it is, it's well done and I'd read it again. (Actually, certain parts have already been reread--wink, wink!) ;) Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,Embarassing,"In all my years of reading I don't think I've ever disliked a heroine as much as this one. 'Joyful' (teehee) is one of the stupidest women I've ever seen in print. Her friend Roxy gets the prize for most annoying. I haven't the least respect for Raphael given all the crap that Joyful heaps on him while he begs for more while gazing at her with pure lust. I don't think I laughed once - there's nothing funny in people who are portrayed as stupid, sick and messed up at these are. And what, pray tell, does the title have to do with the book? If the editors hadn't put the ""tips"" on the back cover there would have been nothing that related at all. It's a catchy title and cover that has no relationship to what's going on inside."
2,Badly Written,"This is the first book I have read by Katie Macalister, and I was NOT impressed. Recently, I've been reading books in the vampire/fantasy/romance genre, and I enjoy the witty ones. This is a badly written book. The character Joy, apparently, loses most of her intelligence when she crosses the Atlantic, and becomes almost an entirely different character. I can see where the author was trying to go with her humor, but the execution was poor. If you've been reading books like ""Undead and Unwed"", I think you will be disappointed.ALSO, as another reviewer remarked, the title has nothing to do with the plot of the book.I might give Katie Macalister another try. Maybe this book is an exception. Several reviewers think highly of her books, but I would borrow the book. I'm not wasting any more money on this author."
2,Hmmm...,"I was actually quite disappointed in this book. I absolutely adore Katie's other writing, but have been avoiding the vampire series because I find that most vampire books I've picked up feel like they were written by a thirteen year old; but, I figured what the heck, I love Katie, maybe I'm wrong. I wasn't. The main character wasn't relateable at all, the hero was very bland, they fell in love far too quickly to be believable and I could see the supposed ""plot twists"" coming MILES away. I just wasn't impressed. I guess I'll go back to sticking with her contemporary and historical novels and leave the vampire and dragon books for the masses."
3,Really 2.5,"For some reason I just didn't laugh at the jokes. I wanted funny, I LOVE funny and I could see that this book was supposed to be funny... yet I didn't laugh. Very frustrating.Speaking of frustrating, I didn't really know which guy I was pulling for! I can't really say much else on that point without possibly ruining the story for others.I did like the fair / mystery. I thought that was pretty exciting. I found the scenery there well written and easy to visualize."
2,Vampires? They don't exist.,"I loved Katie's dragon series so I decided I'll try this and see how she does with vampires. I loved the title thinking that maybe it might be about a vampire falling in love with a human. Boy, was I wrong. It was about two girls going to some place in europe and consulted their friend who was a witch to see if they would meet their perfect match. It started off real good with a little emotion here and there. I was bugged by the fact that was the main hero a vampire or not? As it said 'A girl's guide to vampires' I assumed he was. No, it turns out the guy she didn't love was a vampire or so called 'dark one'. The main character fell in love with a normal guy. This was a very disappointing book to me. The main character was a little annoying but she didn't bother me while her friend did. If you like contemporay romance with a little supernatural twists then this is for you. Romantic paranormal fans will be disappointed."
2,Boring,This was light vampire fluff. The female lead was annoying and whiny. I barely was able to get through this book. And I was surprised I did.
1,I cannot believe anyone likes this book.,"The story would be fine if it were written by someone else. The author seems to randomly pick conflicting adjectives and gives no reason anyone should care anything for the characters. None of the relationships make any sense and there is no explanation why the characters care for each other or why they are where they are or what they are doing there. The heroine repeatedly insults her cohorts by calling them ""boob"" & ""poop"". This illustrates the quick- witted nature of this author. I hope she didn't quit her day job."
3,Took a while to get started,"Actually a pretty good book. It gently mocks and salutes the Freehan vampire series and still is pretty interesting on its own. It will take a while to hook you, I almost gave up after the first chapter - hang in there! The best friend is annoying and the writing is in the chick lit style (breezy, first person)."
5,Katie Macalister is a wonderful writer!!!!!!!,"I absolutely love all of her books but this one was wonderful. Soooooo funny!!!The heroin is hilarious and she stands up for herself. I like that portrayal of her, as a strong woman and not some little submissive girl who does whatever the man tells her to.I would defintiley reccomend this book to anyone who love vampires and humor. Katie does a perfect mix of both."
3,Disappointing,"This book had an incredibly slow start. I almost gave up on finishing it. It was not good. The book started to get better and pick up speed half way though (which is quite late in the game in my opinion). The overall story was interesting, but relatively predictable. Some of the writing was just bad and cheesy."
2,Ugh,"Who are these stupid women and why do we care? The two main female leads in this story are insipid, stuoid and very very annoying. The men in the book, should have run a mile. Otherwise (if you can stop your teeth from grinding) it is a passable vampire (Sort of) romance. The men are right, the author needs to get the women correct."
1,Horrible compared to other books,"I read the first Black Daggar Brotherhood book by JR Ward before I read this book. I thought that it would be similar (not exactly the same but I had hoped it would still be fun and interesting enough to hold my attention). Boy was I wrong. I hated this book. I mean HATED. I had to force myself to read this book simply because I don't like starting a book and not finish it. Sure, my reading BDB before this book may have swayed my opinion but I simply could not stand it. It was boring, lacked any sort of interesting plot or characters. I thought it was a cheap rip off of so many other great vampire series. Don't buy this book. It's not worth your money."
2,Forcing Myself To Read,"I can't believe how incredibly long it has taken me to read this book. I love vampires, and I usually read 100 pages a day, so I should have finished this book in 3 days, 2 if it was really good. The main characters are a bit annoying, especially Roxy. I like sarcasm and wit, but there was overload, sometimes Joy was borderline obnoxious. I pushed myself to read it because I thought that it was going to be so good..I bought the other books in the series. I pray that they are better than this..the first!"
1,Lousy,"This book tries too hard to amuse. Annoying, trite, predictable. Lame dialogue, poor plot development, some potentially interesting angles that never went anywhere. I will generally read anything, but I literally threw this book in the recycle bin rather than pass it on to a friend. I chose to read the Skymall catalog instead on my flight- it was that bad. Waste of money. I took all of the rest of this author's books off my wishlist and wish I had never read this one. It sounded fun, but it was fun like BEING the bouncehouse for a pack of toddlers is fun- NOT!"
3,"More serious moments, please.","This book was hilarious...and very, very annoying. Macalister is obviously extremely witty and creative. Her characters are well-written, and her plot has great potential. The problem is, her story runs joke after joke. They're seriously funny jokes, but they soon begin to grind on the reader. I ended up flying through the last 75 pages of this book because there was no longing to savor each scene. All the sexual drama and story intrigue was completely overwhelmed by Joy and Roxy's non-stop banter and investigative incompetence.I'd like to find out what happens to Christian, but not enough read another story like this one."
3,A Girl's Guide to Vampires,"The premise of this story is very original; it is the execution execution that bothers me somewhat. I believe that the catty, whiny relationship between the to women slows the story and is at times aggrevating. If I had to listen to either of them back biting each other over the period of friendship they professed to have, I would have to run screaming from the room. However, the story begins to get good again when the actual tracing of the vampire begins. I liked the men in this story very much. they were not too overblown, but I found that I wanted to find out what will happen to Christian in the future."
1,Colossal Waste of Time!,"The title of the book and description was far more interesting than the book itself. More thought went into the catchy title than character development or story line.The characters were way over the top. You really had to suspend disbelief. I found it difficult to like any of them. Stupid, annoying or shallow--take your pick. The main female character was so stupid and boring yet so many men were falling head over heels in love with her. Really? And her side-kick, most annoying character ever. She reminded me of an over excited yappy dog. The only remotely interesting character, Christian, was wasted.If you are looking for ridiculous romance, wannabe murder mystery--this read is for you.If there was any way to give this book a negative star I would have."
3,Who needs enemies when you've got Roxy?,"Ok, so Macalister's story was cute and at times really amusing. But it had major holes and some INCREDIBLY annoying secondary characters. Roxy made we want to smack her on page two and the feeling never dissapated, and the ""vampires"" - by page 100 I was wondering if this was supposed to be a spoof, if these people were cardboard cut-outs or something.And my number one problem is the hero's ""secret"" and the heroine's willingess to ""help."" There is no earthly reason he couldn't tell her, and the fact that he made such an issue out of it made the actual revelation a let-down. And if I was in love with someone as head-strong and stupid as Joy, I'd run as fast as I could in the other direction. I't one thing when the heroine insists to be her own ""alpha-female,"" and another when she acts like a fool. Joy was a fool.But nevertheless I was happy for her in the end, and I am curious how she's going to go about finding Christian's ""Beloved."""
3,Not what I expected,"Katie MacAlister is my favorite author, however this book was nothing what I expected it to be. I expected for her to fall for the main character, but I also expected him to be a vamp, which he wasn't. Good book in general, but the cover and title are completely misleading. Yeah, don't judge a book by its cover I know, but still."
1,just wasnt for me,"Im sorry to report it just wasnt for me. I read up to chapter nine then called it quits. The idea is good but on paper its bad. just seems like some grown ups acting like teenagers, which could be fun to an extent. i do however want to read one of the lastest books to see if her writing has changed. i usually just like to read in book order but its not going to happen."
4,"A review to ""a girls guide to vampires""","I've really enjoyed reading this book! To my mind,it's plot is quite interesting, and I just like main characters! Also, it's a good thing to read while travelling)"
1,Awful,"The language was so stupid I wanted to cry. Who says, ""dishy""? The characters were the worst kind of annoying, always cracking really lame jokes. I get the feeling that the author believes herself to be funny, but it was such tired humor. It was like a horrible episode of Laugh In. I'm a big fan of The Sookie Stackhouse novels and similar stories that are fast paced. This book was boring and predictable. The only thing that made it fast paced was my ability to skim.Women do not say, ""Mr. Right"" or ""dishy"" unless it's 1943 and they're in a black and white, lady."
3,Borrow Don't Buy,"This was a so so novel for me. The idea of a vampire having to find their ""beloved"" is original but Joy as a character isn't very likable and neither is her friend Roxy. Joy is very one dimentional and seems to always have the perfect line and she nor Roxy doesn't seem wary of the so called vampires.I have enjoyed Macalister's other work better. This one was kind of weak."
3,So-So..,"I just became interested in vampire litereature, though I have been into all things vampire for a while. This is one of the first books I read, following Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat, so it is not a big wonder it failed my expectations. First of all, it has nothing to do with the back cover, so I wouldn't purchase it according to that. Also, some of the jokes are not funny at all, and the heroine, Joy, is not likeable in any way, or so I thought. She's too stubborn, and talks when she's not supposed to, and that is not likeable. I didn't grow to love her. The concept of vampires are examined under a different light, bringing the concept of their 'Beloved', which is original. But over all, I wouldn't waste my money on it when there are much better ones around."
1,talhotblonde,"This documentary is mysogyne in its purest form and produced to raise money for a personal campaign. Two grown adults use virtual personas as 18 year olds and have a virtual relationship. A young man inadvertently gets caught up in the game, male virtual persona gets agressive and threatening so female virtual persona warns the young man that the male virtual persona may be dangerous, male virtual persona kills the young man. Yes, you guessed, it was ALL the womans fault for being inticing! Made my blood boil that the woman was portrayed as the instigator."
5,Beyond a must see!,Incredible film making.Anyone who has an internet connection should know this story.Anyone who knows anyone with an internet connection should know this story.Words can not accurately describe how moving the film is. You will FEEL the story.
5,Riveting...just when you think you've heard it all...,This story boggles the mind. Even in this day and age. Absolutely shocking and unbeleivable. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. I recommend you don't.
5,The true story for every internet users fear,"If this does nothing else, it wakes you up. In cyber world, never trust anyone, especially your own possible addictions. If these cyber people were as good as you imagine, they would never need to play around on the internet for a life. If it seems too good to be true, then it isn't and never will be. This guy in this true story learned the hard way. Way too many casualties for just pretending and typing."
2,"Nice smell, too little for a large price.","Loved the packaging and smell of the candle, however a bit pricey for the small size..."
4,loved piano,my mom played piano so all rockers with pianos i like. this cd is good but i have most of his on vinyl. his earlier greatest hits is better. more hits that were in my day of age.
4,good music,"This includes late 70s to mid 80s Elton John songs. My personal favorite is ""I'm Still Standing"" which was used in a magazine back in 2000 for ""Got Milk?"" showing Elton John playing the piano with a glass of milk and cake with his milk moustache and saying ""I'm Still Standing."" ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" and ""Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word"" are also classics."
4,Elton Cranks Out the Hits,"Once again, Elton John displays the hitmaking prowess that made him famous. Classic singles abound - highlighted by ""Blue Eyes,"" ""Little Jeannie,"" ""Sad Songs (Say So Much)"" and ""I'm Still Standing."" Another standout is ""Empty Garden,"" Elton's heartfelt 1982 tribute to John Lennon. This 1976-86 compilation represents pop craftsmanship of the highest order."
5,An impressive record of some fantastic color schemes!,"I was very impressed with the number of colour schemes presented in this book. As a scale modeler, this is a goldmine for truly eyecatching and colorful schemes that stand out from the standard Navy gull gray and white, let alone the now standard overall gray schemes of today. Many photos are in very clear color, as they have to be in this case. Some of the black and white photos lack contrast. The captions are all concise and helpful, and state colors when needed. If you want a model that looks totally different on your shelf or in the air, this is your book!"

3,"Season 9 DVDs, Cheapened","After waiting years, seriously, for this release, I was really upset to find the episodes are edited, songs are removed, and all 5 discs are shoved into one standard sized DVD case.The distributors really cheapened the integrity of this otherwise wonderful show. Of course fans should still buy it because afterall, seasons 10 and 11 aren't out yet and the company won't do them unless this one sells okay. Just be warned, you may watch it and your favorite scenes and songs are missing."
4,BEWARE! Edited content,"Aside from sporting new packaging and a 5-disc format for Season 9, there's a little box on the bottom of the back which holds that most dreaded statement for any fan: ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions. Music has been changed for this home entertainment version.""Since it has been several years since I have seen these shows, I won't be able to determine what has been changed, but I felt compelled to alert potential buyers that the music royalty hounds have savaged another classic show. These monopolistic behemoths must be stopped.Beyond that, it is another season of Cheers. The video and audio appear to be excellent. So 5 stars minus 1 star for the edits."
4,Yeeeaahhhh!!!!,"I have to say...it took forever for Season 9 to come out - a little too long in my opinion. While shows that have not been heard of in ten years and have had no real air time - they release their seasons back to back every 4-6 weeks, while we wait years for a show that won 6 Golden Globes; 65 other wins; and 138 nominations. There are a couple of down sides to this Season, and one of them is the music that others have mentioned - especially the ""I Fought the Law"" scene - I had to rewind it a few times to try to hear what song it way - - still have no clue - and it makes no sense. I did also catch the swearing as well. Otherwise, I am happy to have it - it has been too long. The case it came in is awesome - although it does not match my other ones, it's all good - most show seasons do not match anymore due to them changing the cases. Hopefully Season 10 will arrive in a decent amount of time - 4-6 weeks perhaps. Cheers to you!!!"
2,CHEAP Packaging,I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the cheap packaging of Season Nine and Ten. All of the others were nicely packaged and these two seasons came in a cheap plastic DVD holder! Had I known this in advance I may not have spent the money to buy them. I HOPE the final season is NOT packaged this way because I have pre-ordered it!
3,Season 9 above average,"I thought season 9 of Cheers was good but not great. Season 8 I feel was the best of all 11 seasons. However, there were some classic episodes in season 9 such as Bad Neighbor Sam, Rat Girl and Honor Thy Mother. I was a little disappointed in the new disc packaging. I prefeered seasons 1-8 better. I assume that CBS DVD is trying to cut costs so it is safe to say that seasons 10 and 11 will be the same."
4,Cheers to 'Cheers Season 9',I am in love with having Cheers on DVD. I love the show and its cast of characters. This season was one of the better Seasons in that all the characters play more pivotal roles in the show and all the characters get their comedic turn. If you love Cheers as much as I do than you will not be disappointed with Season 9.
3,Amusing Puerto Rican teen comedy,"Enjoyable and well made, but not very original or memorable, teen comedy from Puerto Rico. The film seems more remarkable than it really is when compared to other mediocre Puerto Rican films and when you learn about the minimal budget and the filmmakers lack of experience, but the movie doesnt break any new ground (on the contrary) and, like most teen movies, has some very improbable moments. Casi casi is just a well-acted (except for the tone of the main character's narration, which sounded effeminate at times), amusing and unpretentious teen movie."
2,not classroom appropriate,"I bought this video to show in Spanish classes. It is not classroom appropriate. I can tolerate and justify some bad language, violence, etc. in a movie, if the movie has a profound message. The only cultural message this movie has to offer is that the Puerto Rican characters dislike authority as much as many of the American students sitting in the desks of our schools."
2,Disappointing teen flick,"I bought this film to use with my high school Spanish classes. However, I found it far too crass to use in class. What I did enjoy, from a language teaching perspective, was getting to listen to the Puerto Rican accent. However, this is not something that I will be using with students."
3,"Great film, but inapppropiate for the classroom","I ordered the film Casi Casi for use in my Spanish class for Non-heritage speakers, as another means of incorporating culture into my classroom. I watch all films beforehand, and I am so glad that I did, as there are several words (common amongst teenagers) that absolutely disqualify this film for classroom use. Unless you have a means of editing the film, I don't recommend it for the classroom."
3,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE A TEACHER!,"I was torn after reading conflicting reviews about whether or not this was classroom appropriate, so I bought it for myself to check it out. It is DEFINITELY not school appropriate in my opinion. It contains several swears: the a-word, b-word, s-word, and d-word etc. The students call their principal Mrs. B****-ardson, (Richardson). There is also quite a bit of sexually suggestive language, such as one character telling the other to ""Chupa"", (suck), and discussing their sexual frustrations.With regard to the rest of the movie, it has beautiful views of Puerto Rico, and the language is so clear, but it is best appreciated for a home viewing, not for a classroom."
3,"Interesting setting, that's about it","I guess latin teenagers' movies are about just as good as any others : that is, not very good in general.I must say I found this movie to be mildly entertaining. Although the last 20 minutes are better.The casting, young unknown actors, is interesting, though. And also the fact the setting is Puerto Rico, which is not so common. Yet, the best part of the movie is probably its salsa tune, ""casi, casi""..."
5,Great for Spanish Class,"This movie is a little cheesy, but lovable. My Spanish students enjoyed it and found the characters easy to relate to and humorous. I recommend this to a Spanish teacher, with advanced students, looking to include film in their repetoire."
1,get real bilingual singers!,"I grew up speaking both Spanish and English in NYC, and wanted to share some of the songs I grew up with, with my newborn daughter. I am going to throw this cassette out to ensure she does not pronounce Spanish like a she learned it in high school. A truly wonderful bilingual CD/tape is De Colores by Orozco. His book by the same title is also wonderful."
1,the cassette was dissapointing.,"The songs in the book are nice to sing to. Unfortuneately, thecassette which accompanies the book is horrible, to say the least. Such beautiful songs deserve qualified bilingual singers. The song for ""Un elefante"" was the most dissapointing because traditionally it is a wonderful song."
3,Birthday Boy!,"My son just received this toy for his third Birthday 10/05.It looked like a cool toy on TV.But my son can't put it togetherby himself.The craters that are supposed to nock the tower overdoesn't hit it hard enough to do so,you have to push it with your finger.Although it is a very durable toy,I wouldn't suggestit until about 3 1/2 when the child can put it back togetherby himself.Something to think about."
5,FANTASTIC!!! Even for a train lover!!,My son got this for Christmas and most of the other playsets for his 5th birthday. I didn't think he would like them that much because he is a train (Thomas) lover. Once he got his hands on this set he couldn't stop playing with it. Tons of fun and hours of creative enjoyment... I will get the BC backhoe to complete the set.
5,Great for any dino lover!,"My son just loves this toy. he is three and is starting to get how to put the tower up by himself. He loves to knock it down, usually just by pushing the button and just plays with the dinosaur. I would definatly reccomend this toy, it's super cute and I dont think this will get broke ever, it's made really thick materials."
2,Doesn't Fit Right,"I loved this jacket online and I got it just in time to wear to the World Series, game 4. Problem was, it didn't fit. The length was very short, so whenever I raised my arms, my midriff was exposed. Also the sleeves were just barely to my wrists. I had ordered a Medium, which was sized 8-10. I am only a 4-6 and yet the jacket was still too small. Sadly, I had to return it and never had a jacket to wear to the game."
1,Orville Wright,"This only works on the really old machines, at that price you are better off buying MS Flight Simulator or some other new product"
4,The Ramshackle Suitor,"When Miss Lucy Parnell finds Roderick Kempthorne is in a ditch recovering from a night's indulgence. Lucy is in a search for her sister's child. Her search is spurred on by dreams of a crying child. Thus begins a friendship between a rather devil-may-care ramshackle young man and a young governess on leave from her position searching for clues for her sister's missing child. Nancy Butler offers a study in contrasts, a wealthy younger man is attracted to a governess with an agenda. Charming and delightful, full of the life and vigor of the Regency era, such fun to read."
4,Art of Worldly Wisdom,"I've quoted the author in my blog, relying on the Qxford Book of Quotations. Decided that I needed the original, or as close as I could get. So I bought this and one other translation. I like both. The book is pithy, and offers a lot of advice that our modern politicians might well follow.The Art of Worldly Wisdom"
3,Really small!,"Well-made, but maybe only half the size -- and therefore half the capacity -- of the factory Audi/VW filter. Small size makes for easier removal, but hard to credit it it could offer the same filtering performance."
4,A compelling glimpse at a woman's life in Renaissance Italy,"In the author's native Newfoundland, ""In the Hands of the Living God"" is billed as a book about John Cabot, or Giovanni Caboto, the Italian who discovered Newfoundland in 1497 on behalf of the British crown. But it's really a book about his wife, Mathye Caboto, through the medium of her fictional diaries and letters. Bouzane's spare, poetic prose and her meticulous historical research combine to create a compelling glimpse of Mathye as a wife, mother, musician, composer, and writer, caught up in the chaotic and competitive era of New World exploration."
4,Willie Learns His Manners,"Humorous picture book about Willie White, who never says excuses me when he does something wrong, even though everybody around him is most polite. The painter says excuse me when he spills paint on Willie's head, the boy on the bike says excuse me when he knocks Willie's hat off, etc.Eventually, a police man who rescues him from a tree explains when it is appropriate to say, ""Excuse me,"" and when to reply, ""Certainly."""
5,Beautiful journey through New England forests,"The Northern Forest is an area of twenty-six million acres that stretches from Adirondack Park in New York through Vermont, New Hampshire, and most of Maine. ""Northern Wilds: Journeys of Discovery in the Northern Forest"" consists of historical information about this area as well as the author's personal experiences. The author provides detailed descriptions and commentary of the various facets of the Forest. These descriptions include what one might expect while hiking in the area in different seasons, canoeing the rivers, or camping as well as how the area is changing due to development, logging, and other ecological factors.Filled with stunningly beautiful photographs, it made me want to visit the Northern Forest at my first opportunity. A recommended read, but worth the price just for the pleasure of enjoying the photography."
3,Disappointing,"I was left feeling disappointed and really none the wiser having just finished reading it. The book does talk about some aspects of Gotama's life however I felt Karen was concentrating more on the spritual and philosophical sentiments of his times and surroundings rather than his life itself. Perhaps not enough research?Not an easy read, informative at times, however often going off in spritual tangents.Not a great book but worth looking into."
5,Excellant introduction to the Buddha.,"Well written, novelized biography. Ms. Armstrong does a good job of avoiding much of the early legend that turns many modern readers off. She has researched the Suttas well (chronology of the events of Gotama's early life are not easily determinable from the early writings)to come up with a chronology of events that make for a good story, even if one is unable to know, for sure, if it is entirely accurate, or not."
2,A strange little book.,"The author offers her attempt to reconstruct the life and personality of a teacher who did not wish to have his personality commemorated, and for whom there are no verifiable biographical data in the modern sense. There is nothing wrong with this, of course, but not much point to it either. To learn more about the Buddhist path, you may want to look further."
2,What's the point?,The Buddha didn't want to be worshipped and no reliable historical account of him exists. The whole book is speculation. If you want to study buddhism read a book about buddhism not this book.
2,"Okay, but not great","Armstrong's main contribution in this book is to situate Buddhism in the context of the yoga movement that was in full swing when the Buddha lived. But she is unreliable in discussing the essentials of both Buddhism and yoga - to the extent that only serious practitioners will be able to see through her Western academic filter. Also, several names of cities and different Sanskrit or Pali terms are not correctly mentioned."
2,Book in poor condition,"Two stars because book was listed in ""Good condition"", but I actually recieved a very used NY city public libray book which had obviously been removed from libray service because it was in poor condition. If I had it to do over, I would have spent $8 for a new copy instead of $5 for a copy in this condition. The content of the book is outstanding, thanks to Karen Armstrong."
3,Accessible,"A solid, accessible biography of the Buddha, this book follows him from his days as a wealthy child to his doubt and then enlightenment. For anyone interested not just in the spiritual practice, but also in its origins and historical context, this is a good place to start."
4,Good introduction,"I wanted a basic understanding of who buddha was and what he taught. This book was a great intro, and did what it needed to do. i recommend it."
4,A Good Short Biography,"This is a short, compact read on the life of the Buddha by a scholar of excellent reputation. Armstrong has lived up to that reputation here by delivering another quality work of scholarship that is more accessible to the reader than some of her other writings. If you are interested in a short overview of the facts and mythologies built up around the life of Siddatta Gotama - the historical Buddha - then Armstrong's work should be a quick and rewarding read. There are not too many substantiated facts about the Buddha, but Armstrong has done a skillful job weaving an engaging story around the reports that do exist."
2,"No history, just Mythology","This book is supposed to be a biography of Siddharta Gautama, but of course it does not reach its goal. In the introduction, the author states that ""(t)oday it is ... difficult to accept the nineteenth-century view that the Buddha was simply an invention of the Buddhists"". So, we should expect the author to be able to provide historical facts to proof this statement. Instead, she just translates the well known legends about the Buddha (as they are depicted in the most important Buddhist texts) into modern western language. It is not a book about the Buddha, just a book about how the early Buddhists (1st to 5th centuries C. E.) regarded their own origins."
3,Useful,"For someone, like me, who needs an introduction into the world of the Buddha this book is useful, no doubt. However, the same thing can be said about ""An End to Suffering"" by Pankaj Mishra, a book which brought me a lot more reading pleasure."
4,actually a pretty cool lamp,"like a previous reviewer i could not get it to turn on and was disgusted that it was a dud. in my garage, to box it up for return, i found the somehow theretofore hidden manual. it told me that it was likely that the bulbs had come lose in shipping. sure enough they had. i then saw the light and even set it up to charge my iphone and i'm liking it. it's really kind of cool.the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is because i wanted it to respond to the light-switch at the door to the room, but it needs to be turned on each time. that's a very personal bias. the blue led light helps with that and i am sure i will adjust."
4,Worth getting...,"Verbal expression and tonal patterns exist in different universes, but my personal reaction to this CD was very positive. I liked her voice. I liked how the lyrics and the tonal element melded. This CD made an emotional dent in me (and I'm usually curiously examining the structures in music I listen to -- not expecting an emotional response). I listen to so much music in the course of a day (don't we all!) that it's not very easy to penetrate the 'blur'... Incidentally, I discovered Karrin Allyson in the course of an interview on public radio; she seems like a very intelligent, sensitive, and meticulous person, in addition to having a great voice. As someone who never appreciated Coultrane before, she has made me want to LISTEN to his music with a lot more attention than I might have before..."
1,Stick to the changes,"I am a big fan of the Coltrane album and if you area going to pay tribute, you'd better have a good take on things. McCoy Tyner stayed somewhat close to the actual chords. Just listening to a few of the preview cuts, I was turned off by the piano player's avant gard approach. It didn't maatter how Karrin interpreted the songs, they were already ruined by all those seconds/ninths/13ths etc. in the background."
2,Disappointing,"I have always liked Karrin Allyson. Though she has a small voice, she uses it to good advantage. My problem with this album is that while she sings these ballads very well and gives them there just do, her effort and the mood she attempts to set is totally subverted by the high register horn blowing on nearly every piece which totally destroys the mood she is attempting to set. The liner notes commend the players for laying out; but what Berg et al should have done was lay off. They totally subvert Ms. Allyson's otherwise fine effort. This is thus a truly disappointing session because of its lack of balance and the inappropriate cocophony one is subjected to in listening to it."
2,Honky saxes!,"Ballads, it says. Well, yes, when Karrin is singing, it is balladic, beautiful and soft. Then come the honky cacaphony of saxes. Gone is your tranquility. This is good singing with bad, noisy jazz, not appropriate for the songs here. If I never hear another soprano sax it will be too soon. Try her other CDs."
3,Just OK,"It is a servicable album. Mostly suited for background. If this sounds like damning with faint praise, so be it. I wish someone except Norah Jones would come out with a really exciting vocal album. Maybe I'm just spoiled after listening to Ms. Jones."
1,Pitiful,"I must disagree with the other reviewers. This album was so horrendous that I've already thrown it away (couldn't fathom giving it to anyone, they'd think much less of my tastes if I did). Miss Allyson's voice is nice, but lacks range and power. There have been far better recent renditions of these songs - Krall, Monheit, Cassandra Wilson. Miss Allyson is not in their league."
5,karrin allyson and james carter,"with the recent release of john coltrane's ballads, from the original recording, this is the right time to mention karrin allyson's recording of his songs.interestingly, allyson has chosen to record the eight songs in the order of appearance on coltrane's recording. additions to the coltrane ballads recording, are naima, why was i born?, and everytime we say goodbye.i'd be out of my league were i to talk of pitch, timber and tone. so let me just say that as a lover of coltrane's ballads (you can't begin to imagine my disappointment over years in asking at record stores for a cd not yet made) she sounds alright to me.and james carter on say it, all or nothing at all, and naima, is just icing on the cake.tell karrin allyson, i love her."
3,"gets the job done, but lacks something","I used to be a big fan of Karrin Allyson until I saw her live at the Blue Note (playing a double bill with Ron Carter). She is one of the most irritating performers I have ever had the unfortunate opportunity to witness. Her music is forced and showy (that really comes across onstage) and after going home and trying to listen to her albums, I've realized that her recordings are no different than her live performances. When I listen to this album, I get an uncanny feeling like she is trying to get through these songs as fast as possible so she can move on to recording another album.Maybe I'm biased but if you want good, contemporary, vocal jazz, pick up a Tierney Sutton or Kurt Elling album."
1,Not as advertised,To some people it's extremely important to have a film in it's original aspect ratio. To even more people it's important to receive the product as advertised. My VHS copy of Cat o' Nine Tails is the full screen version. I am terribly disappointed as I cannot watch a movie in full-screen unless it is filmed that way. Thanks for wasting my time.
3,Movie Mediocracy - Morricone Musical Masterpiece,"This is not as great a film as you would expectfrom Dario Argento, but it is very good.I purchased this film because Dario Argentois one of the great film artists and I figuredthat I could not go wrong(not necessarily a good assumption,having seen the awful ""Phantom of the Opera"").It is a crime drama, a murder mystery,an Italian Giallo film by the master of the genre.There are a number of interesting characters.The musical score,composed by the great Ennio Morriconeis a masterpiece.I enjoy viewing the film repeatedly tolisten to the music in the context for whichit was written and performed.Add the score for this film to your collection."
4,A Great Giallo !,"As far as the Argento library goes ""The Cat o' Nine Tails"" while not his best film is still very very good. As far as the giallo(Violent Italian murder mysteries)go in general,it is truly one of the very best of it's kind. The thing you've got to understand is that a good Dario Argento film is better than most other Director's great films so with that said,yes this can be considered to be a great film! While it isn't quite up to the artistic level of the works from the meastro's prime era of films such as ""Deep Red""-""Suspiria""-""Inferno""-""Tenebre"" & ""The Opera"" it does still overflow with the fresh skills that he later hoaned to perfection to create those Masterpieces. Bottom line ""Cat"" is a must have for true giallo lovers & Dario Argento fans alike."
5,Fantastic. Franciscus and Malden Shine.,"As already stated by other reviews, this DVD is excellent value. Fascinating interviews with the director and composer. The title music is haunting. Great radio interviews with James Franciscus and Karl Malden, very rare indeed. The poster and still gallery is excellent as are the biographies. A must for fans."
3,Prone to port failure?,"I've owned this unit for about two years. It has performed well except at this time, there are two ports that appear to have died. They show constant activity even though nothing is plugged into them. While these are in this ""run-away"" mode, the whole switch is impacted. I've been able to solve the problem by plugging a unconnected network cable into both the malfunctioning ports. This isn't quite right. It is ok since I'm not counting on using all the ports but a unit like this should really run without issues for many years."
4,Definitely worth it.,"There are a lot of bad electronica albums out there, but this disc isn't one of them. Glaude's tunes will keep you moving and moving and moving and moving and moving and moving.......The first time I saw Donald Glaude was when he opened for Paul Oakenfold in Seattle. They are very different styles, but Glaude was definitely much more fun.Ever see someone on the street wearing headphones, grinning, and almost imperceptibly dancing to a fantastic beat that only they can hear? They were listening to this disc."
2,Not the best i've heard from him,"This is an ok cd. I wouldn't have bought it if i had listened to it before. I've heard Donald Glaude live and this cd does not do him any kind of justice. There is way better stuff out there by Glaude. Bottom line: don't get this unless there is nothing else out there, you can find better Donald Glaude mixes."
1,"Wrong Book, Be Aware Of The Trickery!!!","This Book Is The Wrong One, Look At The CopyRight Info. It Is The Second One. The First Was Published By Minister Frakan. The Words Are Changed, and tooken Out. If You Want the Real Copy Send Me An Email. Ericjevanssr@yahoo.com. Put Message to the black man in the subject box"
2,good to have around the house,"I don't know, some good thought mixed with, well you have to read it for yourself. I think it is a good histrocial referrence."
2,wrong inner tuber for a lawn tractor,they were not regular lawn and garden tires they looked like a big bicycle tire. the stems were all wrong for a lawn tractor rim.
5,"In-depth, hard-core information!","A no-holds-barred preparation guide with lots of information I've never seen anywhere else! I especially like his chapter on independent energy (40 pages!) and raising animals for food. The barter chapter was great, too. A must in anybody's Y2K library!"
4,"Preparation is positive,","I wish I had came across Boston T. Party back in '99, but as I have recently found him, I am pleased nonetheless. Surviving Y2k is a pretty good overall how to book. He even goes into the subjects of animals, coinage and types of generators. Being an adult is about self reliance and not expecting the nanny state to wipe your nose. Buy some extra food, tools, medicine, gloves and ammo. It is not difficult. Realizing this society is a thin veneer, well that may be a big pill to swallow."
5,A thinking man's survival manual,"There's a huge amount of well thought-out information in this book, it can form the basis of an excellent survival library all on its own.Boston's reasoning behind his picks for livestock are worth the price of the book alone.I give this book a 100% ""must have"" for any serious student of survival."
5,the nuts and bolts of it all,a full rundown of life when things go south . dont get be left in the dark with out it
4,Underrated Gem,"I didn't know anything about this movie other than what was written on the DVD case (and I wasn't sure about calling it an ""existential thriller""), but was pleasantly surprised. It was filmed in black and white and is subtitled, if that matters to you (it didn't to me).The trailers give you an idea of what the movie is about, but I think it's better if you watch the movie unfold without knowing anything about it.The first half hour did drag a bit, but after that, it was great. After watching it, I can now see why it was called an existential thriller. Very well done for the director's first film and worthy of the many awards it received."
3,"Average Shoes, Bad Propaganda.","This pair of shoes is not that bad, but when you look at the picture shown you have a quite distinct impression of it, mainly on its color. When I got the shoes I went ""Eh?, they look like brown on the picture!"". The rubber part and the laces are absolutelly black."
1,A Bad Deal,Very uncomfortable and cheap looking shoes. The promotional pictures looked very stylish and I made a complete fool of myself by getting coaxed into buying these shoes. Personally I expected better quality from Adidas.
3,Nice design,"Nice retro design. I usually wear 10.5. I feel a little unconfortable, too small. My fingers cry everytime I use this shoes. I should bought a 11"
3,Mott,"This album is in the Rolling Stone 500 of all time, the reason why I got it. However it did not impress me. The covers are not as great as the originals and the Bowie sauce is too thick. The remaster does sound ground though."
4,"a good piece of music, but not groundbreaking","David Bowie wanted to work with this band because he felt that they had talent, and transformed Mott the Hoople into a real group with this album. But these 5 star reviews are a bit too much. I like All the Young Dudes, but opening a record with a less than great cover of ""Sweet Jane"" is just not how an album should be opened up. You'd enjoy this album a lot more if you ate up all of David Bowie's music. But this is no Ziggy Stardust, or even half of that."
4,Glam Rocking dudes,"Mott The Hoople / All The Young Dudes: The Bowie Title Track is the big hit here. Hoople even manages to out do Lou Reed with their version of ""Sweet Jane"". However, as enjoyable as the rest of the album is, it only manages to rate four stars."
5,go ahead find even one weak track !,"The argument amongst Mott fans is usually- ""Which is better- 'All The Young Dudes' or 'Mott' "" ? Listen to them both back to back, and try to find one bad track on EITHER album. Good luck ! (By the way- lyrically ""All the Young Dudes"" , musically ""Mott"")"
4,supremacy in presentation,this title is superb in the presentation of the chinese brush painting to the beginer artist. though a little un organized and somewhat free falling in the degree of control expected from the student it stresses the need of practice and give numerouse examples of art subjects to be copied as part of the learning process.i'd give it an 8
2,tough to learn by,It might be that this is just a tough topic for a book I'm not sure but this book definitely doesn't have enough detail in terms of clear steps/pictures for a beginner.
5,Europe to the Max,"Excellent subject material, a must have for anyone concidering Europe travel for the first or 5th time."
2,Show Me the Numbers,"The book is good for someone that has never used or dealt with the design and graphic presentation of data. This book is NOT for someone who has skill in developing tables and charts for presentation, and is looking for new and different ways to present data."
5,show me the numbers,Great book for someone starting out on this most up-to-date subject. Great for small businesses also.
5,Require (and enjoyable) Reading,"Loved this book. You learn from it and have several ""aha"" moments and you'll keep going back to it for reference."
4,Love this book,I am thoroughly enjoying reading this book and I highly recommend it to anyone who has occasion to present quantitative information.I really like the way the author thinks about and then presents the subject matter. The book is also a delight to interact with -- it's obvious much thought went into the layout.I spent most of a gorgeous summer weekend sitting in the yard reading this book -- it is that good :)
5,reek's best,"if you like reek daddy you need this album, the production, the delivery, all sick. one of the best cd's to come out of vallejo and the bay in a while. reek comes hard, this is his best, pretty much all the tracks are bangers, especially 'high power funk' and 'doin somethin dirty', dubee has some sick verses too. get this"
4,Fun!,"The disgruntled person who only gave this 2 stars was right.....it's a model, not a puzzle. Laying all that aside.....I had a blast with this! I spent about 3 evenings on it....but I worked REAL SLOW! An intermediate modeler could get this tonight and be done with it well before bedtime!I would recommend using a little glue in places.....helps it ""feel"" more sturdy in the end.......I'm only about 90% finished with mine.....about the attach the shoulders/arms in the next few minutes.....and then it's done!It was WAY OVER my 4 year-old son's head (technically-speaking)....but a highly literate 6 year-old would give this a go, with a bit of proper supervision.I'm thinking about painting it with glow-in-the-dark paint!! A touch of sandpaper here and there would help....and the instructions suggest doing just that if needed."
3,It is a toy after all,"I purchased this item for my nephew, at that time he was into dinosaurs and skeletons, it's pretty cool, the only negative thing is that when i try to take the pieces out of their form, some broke. So handle with care."
3,almost,"almost....close but no cigar a few tracks hold you and make ya go yeah, yeah, yeah, but ultimatley the album as a whole falls short of anything spectacular. Gnecco can sing, thats for certain, and it is oh so obvious he's nodding heavily to jeff buckley, whom he is unfortunatley compared to, and cant hold a candle to. i'd like to hear this guy sing without the current flavor of Creed like post 90's area metal. at times gnecco sounds more like bruce from iron maiden of all people. and thats not to shabby either."
5,Amazing album,"This is probably my favorite album of all time. Ours is an amazing band, and this album is just awesome. From the first song to the last song, it keeps you interested. Jimmy Gnecco has an amazing voice. The second Ours album isnt as great as this one, but it's still pretty good. The third album is in the making, and I plan on getting it the day it comes out. All in all, get this album."
3,the regression of rock,"First of all let me say that this is not a bad album. There are far many worse albums out there. However, I don't think this album is really presenting anything new. If you've ever listened to Jeff Buckley's music then you probably know what I'm getting at here. Jeff Buckley was original, and not only that but he was talented in songwriting, singing and instrumental abilities. This album is almost blatantly copying Jeff Buckley, but it isn't improving on his work. This is unfortunate but it happens a lot, just look at the Strokes."
2,The flavour content is weak....,"There is no staying power with this album, basically, everything seems watered down, from the uninspired vocals and lyrics, to the blase insturmentation. I don't see why everyone loves this album, its BORING! After all, they price it in the bargin bin for a reason...."
1,You can't avoid the Jeff Buckley comparisons,"I'm a little dissapointed in myself that I spent money on this CD. Now I must admit I am a huge Jeff Buckley fan (RIP), so I may be biased in my opinion about this record. But the fact is, Jimmy Gnecco's voice is amazing but he needs to find his own identity. It's almost like he has thinking, ""What would Jeff do?"", when writing the vocal lines. As far as the music, it's kinda bland, over-produced, formulaic, blah, blah, blah.Hopefully, the next effort will a little more original."
1,Bono!?!?!??!????,"This album stinks. If anyone really likes this and thinks its original, try picking up some U2, and you will never touch this CD again."
5,Ours: Distorted Lullabies,"An incredible CD is hard to come by these days. But OURS has succeeded in recording an amazing debut. It's hard not to notice a resemblance in Jimmy Gnecco's voice to such greats as Jeff Buckley, Thom Yorke, & Bono. And the songs on the album at times recall an early Radiohead, but nevertheless, a great song is just that and Jimmy sings them all with extreme emotion.OURS: DISTORTED LULLABIES, is a laid back album with catchy melodies and great musical textures. Highlights include: 'Dizzy', 'Dancing Alone' & 'Fallen Souls'.The album is full of amazing songs and it was the first single 'Sometimes' that grabbed my attention. Since then, I've had the opportunity of catching an acoustic show of the band. They are by far one of the better new bands out there. I just hope that more bands like this get the recognition they deserve."
4,A Good Start,"I bought this cd after hear ""Sometimes"" on M2 and I have not been dissapointed. It at times drags but I think this is a band to look out for in the future....especially if they expand and improve upon what they are doing. Highpoints of the album include ""Sometimes"", ""Fallen Souls"", ""Medicated"", and ""Dancing Alone"". Buy Ours, its worth a try."
4,Art+Rock=Ours...grand debut!!!,"I give this album 4.5. stars.This is a stellar peice of art-rock that ranks as a most dynamic debut. The songwriting is emotionally empowered with a great far-reaching range of dark power rock to whispery sad ballads and Steve Lillywhite's production is second to none. Jimmey Gnecco's vocal prowess is theatric and chilling. This record stands as one of my very favorites and I think it is the hint of brilliant things to come from this band. He may croon like a spectre of Jeff Buckley but their musical idealogies have separate agendas. A hurt, angry and beautiful peice of work. Rock truly needs powerful and sensitive/emotional soundscapes like this! Highly reccomended. Buy it here at Amazon and prepare to have a noble treasure of art-rock in your hands."
4,Trying to be fair,"This isnt typically my music, but I went to school with Jimmy. so I was interested to see what his music was like. His voice is incredible, there is no doubt about that. It was when we were kids. He is a talented vocalist as well as a songwriter. It isnt a cd that I listen too regularly, but that is only because I dont listen to this kind of music regularly. He DOES have that U2 thing going on, but its a good thing. Listen too Distorted Lullabies, you will hear some interesting things...a good band...and again...an incredible voice."
2,Not Quite There,"Where does one start when writing a review of music that has so much promise but leaves the listener disappointed? Amazon predicted I would love this release. I was sure I would too. The first release from this title ""Sometimes"" caught my undivided attention. The rest is all downhill. This review is simply my opinion. I certainly can understand the appeal of Ours as a band. To me Ours is a poorman's Radiohead. I know this will make people cringe but I feel they haven't done enough to create their own interpretation of the electronic sound. They ride the coattails of Radiohead with a sprinkling of U2 thrown in for good measure. It is entirely possible my mind my change as this CD matures. But for now it remains a weak attempt to join the solid genre of psychedelic electronica. Buyer beware."
4,Radiohead?,"I have got to STRoNGLY disagree! How can you compare ""OURS"" to Radiohead? Have you heard Radiohead ever? Personally I cannot stand listening to Radiohead and to say they are a poor imitation of them? That's a double insult. ""OURS"" have songs that don't sound like whining cats that are having their flesh torn off them while wailing sounds are played in the backround, like Radiohead. I'm not trying to insult the fans of Radiohead and please, continue on loving them but don't compare Ours to Radiohead.......this is misleading."
5,here is the light,"i was introduced to Ours over the summer by a friend. she made me listen to sometimes. i loved that song soo much i asked her if i could barrow the cd that same day. i ripped it to my pc and it sat there dormant for a month or so. then when i went on vacation i put this cd, along with a few others, onto a cd-r and listen to them on my cd player. i listened to the whole cd without stopping. i was in love.gnecco is such a good singer. makes me wanna sing. and people say Ours sounds alot like jeff buckly and radiohead. i personaly like Ours ALOT more then both thoose bands put together. this is possibly the best cd ive ever hearrd in my life. and this is coming from a hardcore ozzy zeppelin and iron maiden fan."
4,Songs to Download,"Sometimes, Dizzy, Medication, Fallen Souls.Notice Gnecco's amazing voice, a cross between Fran from Travis, Bono and some stellar sounds that are all his own."
4,They didn't love you in our time.........,"Great melodies, great lyrics, great musical composition. I love this CD from begining to end. You can hear a lot of influence from everything from Jeff Buckley to Concrete Blonde to U2 to even Radiohead. But Ours is much darker than these 4...this album is a definte sign that intelligent goth-rock is here and will persavere.The song ""Bleed"" comes on near the end of the album and catches you off guard, it's too beautifully dark to explain in words.Their new album ""Precious"" is to be even more amazing, their first single ""Leaves"" is so intense and beautiful.If you dig the 4 artists listed above, but have a penchant for something darker and more intense, listen to this album."
5,I Want To Breathe The Day... Keep All The Clouds Away,"Another band where their debut proves to be the best. I saw these guys perform at a Marilyn Manson show and by the time their set had ended I knew I had found a great new band. I bought both their first and second albums and was quite impressed with Distorted Lullabies, however their second album 'Precious' was not precious by any means; it severely lacked the originality that the first album had. Here's a quick overview:1. Fallen Souls - 9/102. Drowning - 10/103. I'm A Monster - 8/104. Sometimes - 10/10 (gorgeous chorus)5. Miseryhead - 8/106. Here Is The Light - 8/107. Medication - 8/108. Dancing Alone - 6/109. Bleed - 6/1010. Dizzy - 5/10 (low point of the album/NOT a horrible song but it almost cost the album it's fifth star)11. Meet Me In The Tower - 6/1012. As I Wander - 7/10Even though I was semi-disappointed with their sophmore effort I eagerly await their third album 'Mercy' coming out April 15th."
2,You get what you pay for...,"For $4 it's not bad, but within two weeks the black paint started coming off to reveal the white plastic, looks horrible, but if you don't care how the case looks then this is the case for you."
1,don't buy,This thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you don't ever open your phone this is the case cover for you
2,Junk,"Snaps on easy but snaps off easy too. It also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do. This case also hinders comunications, maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line."
1,very brittle,"bought a pack of six about a month ago, thought I was getting a great deal, I've used five already... they break so easily."
5,Great product.......,"I am very happy with the phone case, there are alot of cases available, this is by far the best in my opinion."
1,Disappointed,"It was/is very disappointing to be directed to a completely different title and author when looking inside. The explored title...""The Construction and Representation of Race And Ethnicity in The Caribbean and The World""... is indeed an extremely important and relevant work, however, I was hoping to look inside the listed title....."
4,Good Beginners Book,"This is a good book for beginners. If you are looking for a book to show you PRACTICAL knife fighting, read this book. As a student and instructor in the martial arts for 15 years it is good to see an instructor with the same views of practical applications for the street that I have. It is a win at all cost world and this book gives you the information to help you survive. A very straight foreward approach to knife fighting. If you are interested in this book you should also check out Tao of Jeet Kune Do by Bruce Lee. It's not a knife fighting book, but it covers all aspects of fighting. There are similarities in views of practicality."
2,"Interesting, but not very useful","This book is interesting, but in general, very poorly written. The author comes across as an overblown windbag (not an uncommon occurrence for this type of book). The techniques described are reasonable, if not earth-shattering. Anyone interested in more than an academic understanding of knife-fighting would be well served to put the book down and start training.The most annoying thing about this book was the very poor quality of the writing and the editing. There are literally hundreds of instances of factually incorrect statements, grammatical errors, and misspellings. It was very difficult to take the author seriously when so many blatant errors made it into the book.Not a book I'd recommend."
1,Play Nice,"To be honest, this book wasn't all that great. The author spent more time explaining how his ""dynamic"" method was better than everyone else's instead of actually teaching the art of blade wielding & fighting. There was even space for a comic strip of some fat, cross eyed martial arts master rejecting a sparring session with the author out of fear. Now Mr. Ryan, play nice or I'll put you in the garage-sale bin."
2,Not Useful,"I found this book to be a waste of time. It covers very little of the skills or techniques that I was hoping to find. There are too many, too small chapters. The author provides an introduction to numerous schools and theories of knife fighting, but goes no more than skin deep into any of them. Much space is wasted on the history of these different schools, and yet--despite all the pages used--the information is no more than what you could gather by spending a couple of hours reading about knife fighting on Wikipedia. I'm still searching for the book that will fill my needs."
1,Save your money for the real thing,"I was expecting quite a bit more (or perhaps different) from this video. Too much time of this 30 minute video is spent in weak fantasy story plots - horses running around in a field and shots of a lady's face as she admires the car & its driver. A few minutes are spent showing the guy tearing up a country road, but no track footage is presented. One semi-interesting interview w/ Pininfarina is shown, but the questions are soft and the answers are obvious. There is no factory footage showing construction, which would have been interesting. The sound is the most disappointing feature - the V12 music is the primary reason people would buy this video over a book, alas, no justice is done here."
3,5 year wedding gift!,Got this from my husband for the 5 year wedding gift. Like it.. just too big for me to display anywhere.
1,Poorly authenticated rubbish,"Harrison's book, first published some 20 years ago, is now seriously out of date. More recent research has shown much of his material to be ineptly researched, misleading or downright wrong and it's a great shame no effort has been made to correct the numerous errors identified by careful reinvestigation of some of his leading cases. Those interested in SHC would do much better to check out more recent books such as those by John Heymer, Jenny Randles and Peter Hough, or Larry E Arnold (if you want a generally 'pro' point of view), or Joe Nickell, for the skeptical perspective."
3,Spontanous Human Combustion tied to other phenomena.,"Harrison does an interesting job tieing Spontanous Human Combustion (SHC) to other paranormal phenomena. The book is well-researched and detailed, although the telling of it is a little rambling (a trait I consider common to many older British authors). The man is a believer in SHC, and the book is written from that viewpoint."
4,Crest Glide Threader Floss,"Excellent product. After my braces were removed and the wires attached behind my teeth to help keep them in place I was using Oral B SuperFloss. Despite being very careful this floss is very rough (I'm not talking about the thick part, even the thin part was very rough). In two months I had managed to detach both wires. The dentist recommended I use glider floss which is much more gentle. I couldn't find it in any stores so I bought it on Amazon. It is like switching from canvas to satin bedsheets!! And it is much easier to pull through so I don't fear that my wires will detach again. I would have given it 5 stars, but the only minor draw back is that occasionally it does snag/shred a bit. Not a big deal as the micro thin shredded bit pulls out easily. But basically this product is very near perfect."
2,Disappointing cheap quality,"My wife has been looking for one of these for a while so when it showed up on The Friday Sale she bought it for about $23.Two of the glasses were cracked on arrival and all the parts reak of cheapness. The cooler area for food is incredibly small and is likely to crush whatever food you put in there. The pocket is located between your back and all of the picnic stuff, so your actually squeezing your food any time you wear it.And worst of all, the straps are the worst design I have ever worn. The design of the attachment of the top of the straps to the bag is so backwards it actually hurts to carry it with any weight. And the straps are so short, only a child or small woman can easily get their arms through the openings. So any normal sized person is putting so much pressure on the food pocket that it crushes everything.I like the detachable insulated wine bag so I give it a 2 instead of a zero."
4,Picnic easily,"I purchased this product as a birthday gift for my fiance. Overall, I would rate this as a good product. The bag is well made and held up to the two of us as well as our three dogs picnic-ing. The plastic glasses are a little cheaply made and one was cracked when I received the backpack. Replace the napkins that come with the backpack with some of your own."
4,Great gift,I bought this for a birthday gift and it was a big hit. Arrived in great shape. Seems much more expensive than it is.
3,Pretty good,"Not bad for an inexpensive pack. I only expect a couple of years out of it (I use it at least once a week) and that is about the quality I got. Servicable and inexpensive, just what I expected."
2,Not durable,"I purchased this item for my wife. We like to day hike and thought this would be a perfect carrier for a light lunch, cheese, wine. The problem is that after only a few uses, the zipper on the backpack jammed. The wine ""glasses"" are made of cheap lightweight plastic. This backpack is cute but not functional."
1,Read all labels!,"This particular item looks cute enough, but if you look closely at the attached tag you will see that the bottom states ""contains items that have been known to cause cancer/birth defects"". Not a pretty warning for dishware."
5,Bought this as a wedding gift...,"and also for my wife. Perfect. Wedding couple says they loved it. Has everything you would want: - wine glasses, cutting board, knife, corkscrew, plates, and all the utensils you could want. Love it. It's my new default wedding/birthday gift for young couples...well, as long as the price doesn't go up."
3,"Great idea, design flaws","I really have to say, it's a great idea, but with a couple of design flaws. The wine ""glasses"" had two chipped - so I will have to return it - but it's more cost efficient to go to the party place and get more. The price is so cheap, it's not an issue, but it IS an annoyance. The rest is true, the food should be on the outside, not the inside, it can and will if stuffed - get crushed. The wine is only one sided, so it can be awkward. In all, this is less than the cost of a couple of movie tickets, why complain?"
3,GREAT FILM - COMMENTARY?,"The first time I viewed this - on DVD - I was impressed - not completely convinced/overwhelmed - but impressed enough to rent yet again - ok, I had a free rental coming - but I HAD to have a listen to the filmmaker's commentary. The commentary is excellant - talky, but not too talky, etc. What I do not understand - maybe someone else out there has noticed - during the commentary - the filmakers make one or two references to the closing credits. WHERE ARE THEY? Also, the commentary seems to get cut off mid-sentence at the film's end - then - blackness. It works, but I get the feeling I'm being cheated out of something! A problem with Freestyle Home Entertainment?"
1,horrible,"depressing, sadistic, sick, twisted, boring, dumb. Had to fast foward through most of the 2nd half. 1st half is O.K., but then............."
2,The Sixth Sense Wanna Be,"Ok, I'll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn. This film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon. It really doesn't take a genius to figure out this plot. I mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room I turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film's plot and sure enough I was right on the money, only I thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no, it had to keep going and going...just end allready, I get it!!"
2,The only good thing is the reset on the handle,"This wheel is not made very well. I bought this wheel because it has a counter reset on the handle. The construction is of mostly plastic and not made for daily commercial use. The reset button broke within the first week of using the wheel. After fixing the broken button, it works, but not as well as it should. If you are looking for a wheel for everyday use, buy a more expensive one, as you will not feel like you can depend on this wheel."
1,Overrated,"This novel rates, at most, a passable 3 stars,... but it is certainly not worth 5 stars. The writing is easy to read, in fact, very simple. The main character, Conrad Clay, is a petty, self-centered egotist who is only concerned with his own 10-year-old desires. Clay's parents have significant financial and marital problems and don't have time to deal with the selfish needs of a child who thinks the world revolves around him so Conrad attempts to lash out by building a home-made bomb to feed his need for attention. The characters of the immediate family were well-developed but the other characters including Clay's best friend Loop were not fully brought to life, only used as a vehicle for Conrad to act or react upon. The novel is, fortunately, fairly short and joins the ranks of the many disposable books available for a long wait at the airport."
4,Very nice tool,"These pliers are very useful when wiring up recepticles, switches, fixtures, etc. The wire stripping holes work great. The quality is impressive. Rock solid and made in the USA."
1,everyday internet for dummies,Unless you absolutely can not figure stuff out for yourself do not waiste your dough on this title!I paid hardly anything for it so I lucked out!
2,johnstone book #18,Although this book met all the service level agreements it came much later than books from other vendors ive used through amazon
3,"nice to see others ""like mike"" too!",.....a golden & good interpretation...good show! bravo!...goes right along with the other 'tubulars'....they need a box set of all the tubular bells with the live DVD versions!...there already is a Tubular Bells IV(4)..it is my understnding it is the Millenium Bell..& the live DVD from Berlin....ENJOY!
2,Just not the same,"Although I enjoy piano versions of music, this album was just not the same for me as the original new age concept music. Oldfield has commented in his autobiography that the insight which gave him his first two albums seems in some ways to have been lost forever, and for me there is simply nothing like the original versions of Tubular Bells and Hergest Ridge."
4,Over priced,"This is a great training cross over toy for my grandchildren. If I had not been able to purchase it for $299 at Pep Boys I would not have purchased it at all. You can purchase a gas powered mini ATV for children for $15 LESS including shipping and handling at several sites on the net - than this toy at Toys R Us. At $499 plus tax and shipping this toy is $560 from Toys R Us. Way overpriced for what it is and what it can do. The gas powered versions handle better, look better and provide more growth and longevity than this battery toy so I would recommend a gas powered version if you have to pay the asking price of $499."
1,bad,"this thing is a piece of junk you would not believe how many problems it has it will burn a hole in your pocket, its a money pit.AS soon as you replace something there will be another part to break,not to mention that minimoto went out of business and sold there left over parts to monster part.Anyway i would stay away from this nightmare."
1,it sucks,"im 15 years old one of my cousins got this it is stupid i have a $6,000 dollar suzuki Z400 and it is set up to be raced and it goes atleast 60mph alot better"
3,Emerald,"This movie reminded me of a combination of 10 Little Indians and Then There Were None. Other reviewers have compared it to Saw II (which I haven't seen). I tried twice to watch it and finally, on the third try, I watched it completely. The clashing of the different personalities and also the tensions were handled very well - you could feel the violence building even though the characters were reluctant to act upon it.The best part of the whole movie was the ENDING - really unexpected!!!Rent it and watch it."
2,then there was one,"What's all the Raa raa about??? Saw 2 was much better. To me this could be a ok tv movie,but if this scares you there is a serious problem that should be looked at.Thought the acting had a lot to be disired. The whole thing was a kiddy movie. If you want some scarry stuff email me."
3,"Familiar but not bad, give it a watch","In an age where there are about 6-10 bad horror movies coming out a month, ""House of 9"" delivers pretty well. The premise feels real familiar to fans of ""Saw"" and ""The Cube"" series, but it is its own movie none-the-less. Most of what this film is about is the nature of interaction and isolation. The reasoning behind there predicament isn't explained much more than that of wealthy self indulgent madness. But we seem to except it for that and move on. There are some twists, but we also know where this is all leading. I enjoyed it and thought the mix of characters worked. I would watch this again.(Eyesofchaos dot com)"
4,GOOD MOVIE.,"Well I liked it. And the endings a real big....well, see for yourself!!! Alternate possible title: Survival of the Meanest...or of the Luckiest! Just watch it. BUT RENT IT FIRST BEFORE BUYING IT. That's my opnion. The ending will kill ya. I just couldn't beleive it. AWESOME & SURPRISING ENDING! Give it a try."
5,You will get blindsided by the unexpected finish!,"Speaking as a Kelly Brook fan and not as a movie critic I'm going to say thumbs down to this one.Okay. I have to admit I was expecting/hoping to see Kelly in some sexy clothes and maybe a bikini or even a nude scene. There was none of the above.This movie has a very thin plot. A bunch of people get locked into a house and resort to killing each other. There is a lot of ""B movie"" grade acting but I will admit I liked the surprise ending! Just when you think you know how it's going to end...Bam! You will get blindsided by the unexpected finish!If you like B movie thrillers with at least one pretty girl then you should add this movie to your collection.If you are fan of Kelly Brook you should check out Survival Island.Survival IslandSurvival Island is an adventure movie and Kelly is in a bikini showing off her nice legs and everything else for the entire film."
3,House of 9: Review,"It was an okay movie for a horror; however, the plot is very similar to SAW 1-3, and I did not find this very amusing. If you have nothing better to do then this movies is for you, I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,House Of What???,"I would like to say: I have read some very good books over the years and they were written with Plot and Ploy. This movie was low budget and it lacked meaning to me. The characters didn't have any structure at all, they were just there.I did not find this movie interesting at all I only watched it so that I could get the Soundtrack info. Now that I did like.One more thing, If I'm not mistaken, the scene with the rapper (who's Black) and the Cop (who's a policeman) gives off the impression that youngblack men are hostile to the police. why else would this twisted directorput that scene in the movie? One thing I've learned in this life, is thatthere are some very sick people in this world.... Just look at the director of this movie...Think about it!!"
2,waste of money,"What a waste of $4.00 to rent this crap. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of the humorous ending. ALso, who and why compared this to Saw???? Except for the fact that a group of people must try to get out of a no win situation there is nothing remotely like Saw about this plodding, boring piece of junk movie. Save your rental money."
4,Not the usual.,"A very good film, nicely paced and not too much gore. A wonderful ending. I really enjoyed it."
2,"Saint-Saens: Sym #3 (""Organ"")","Very clear, quite background, great soundstage, lower registers practically nonexistant. This piece should be a showcase for the organ sections but sadly, it isn't. I am Still looking fot the perfect recording/mastering of this incredible, symphonic masterpiece. Same/Same for Pictures at an Exhibition."
5,Excellent and Fact Based,"It is always refreshing to read a book about the Bible which doesn't kow tow to the sensibilities of the literal fundamentalist. I found this book intelligent without being condescending, and I found it very accessible. I heard the author on an NPR interview while driving in my car and immediately turned to go get the book. I am not sorry."
2,"A fairly good read, but why so biased?","I am a recently saved Christian and I picked up this book to try and get a crash course on the Bible. While I did learn a little, and enjoyed parts of it a great deal, I get the very strong impression that the author would not be pleased that I believe the Bible is inspired.If you read only this book, you will come away thinking that every word in the Bible is contradictory and can be disproved by science or history. I thought I was going to learn about the Bible, not the author's blatanly biased views or the views of the anonymous ""scholars"" he continually cites."
3,Bible Book,Okay book. Not necessarily inspiring or helping to understand the doctrines of the bible and application to our lives.JOHN
2,Somebody that needs to study a little more,"This book is very misleading right from the start, the subtitle is ""Everything you need to know about the Good Book but Never Learned."" The author then proceeds to do nothing but ask question upon question and then throw out some possibilities. Most of these possibilities are worded to do nothing but cause confusion and doubt for a student just starting out trying to learn what the meaning of the Bible is all about. If there is one good thing to say about this book, it is that for those of us Christians that want some practice taking a barrage of questions about the Bible, this book is good practice. I'm quite astounded that people think that these ""valuable insights"" are not taught in today's churches. If they aren't they should, that much I'll agree with, but honestly, nothing new here. Mr. Davis needs to stick with the Civil War, or do a little more studying."
1,"Terrible, Biased Book - Don't waste your time or money","This book is terribly written and is not worth the time or money. Kenneth Davis writes with no desire to explore both sides of the Bible. He ignores historical and archeological evidence supporting the Bible and uses obscure, little known, and controversial books for his support to try and discredit the Bible. One small example, Davis acknowledges the historical writing of Josephus (a Roman historian during the life of Jesus Christ), even mentioning that Josephus mentioned Jesus in his writings. However, Davis blatantly omits the fact that Josephus wrote that Jesus rose from the dead and that his followers were called Christians. This is just one example in a book that totally ignores most of the facts supporting the Bible's accuracy. As one reviewer put it so accurately ""An aply named book. The author truly does not know much about the bible."" Don't waste your time or your money, especially if you are looking for truth from reputable sources."
1,The Bible from an ATHEIST'S point of view,"This is an ultra-liberal politically correct attempt to discredit the Bible and its teachings. The author has no credentials to write such a book, and it shows. Since when does a book on history or geography make one a theologist? All he does is tout his own biased views and attempt to ridicule and tear down that which Christians and Jews believe.I would definitely recommend avoiding this book. Unless you are a liberal or an atheist and want to ""feel good"" about your lack of belief in God."
1,"Mired in condescension, Author misses the whole point","The author seems to ignore the message and majesty of The Bible, focusing instead on minutia. His index illustrates this point listing only a single reference for ""LOVE!"""
1,Why is Davis qualified to educate you on the Bible?,"Was this book written to ""educate"" people ignorant of the bible, or to make money? The main problem with the book is Davis's lack of explaining his stance on such issue as, biblical inerrancy. Many interpretation and explanations biblical scripture are unfounded and stated as fact without apposing views presented.What bothered me is the book and the web presents basically no information about Davis beyond his occupation. If this book is read to understand more about the bible, ultimately the Christian Religion, one should understand the position of the author.If you ""don't know much about the bible"" I suggest reading the bible, and attending a church where the bible is studied! If the bible is the foundation of the Christian religion, it must be read as that, and not as a literary work. For the beginner of biblical study as supplement to reading the bible I suggest R. C. Sproul's and Robert Wolgemuth's book""What's In The Bible."""
4,a historical perspective on the Bible,"As a Christian and someone with great interest in history and literature I found this book extremely interesting. Like all great books, it makes you think. I didn't agree with everything that author said but I don't think that's necessary to enjoy the book. It will challenge more conventional thinking. It will point out some interesting facts you probably never realized. Not for serious Biblical scholars, better for people who want to get to know the Bible a little better."
3,Mixed bag...,"I am hot and cold on this book. While it was a good read and seemed to be convincing at certain parts, I was not impressed with how the author proved what he said. Most of the time his ""facts"" were shaky and/or not well cited.Fans of his ""Don't Know Much About History"" will be just as entertained with this book due to his writing style. Just don't expect any revelation or smoking gun concerning the Bible."
1,Absolutely RIDICULOUS!!!,"this book is full of ridiculous assumptions and misleading (if not intentionally incorrect) arguments. VERY one sided. Not something I would recommend either to the liberal or conservative Bible scholar. There are MUCH better books on the subject... try reading them instead. Wish I could have given it ""0"" stars... but they wouldnt let me :("
1,One Star is WAY too many!,"A truer title for a book has never been penned! Mr. Davies, rather than performing his own research, has relied upon generally discredited theory from the 19th century to shamelessly peddle a book to the generally uninformed masses who are seeking a higher truth. The theory upon which this book is based is known as ""Form Criticism"" and has been soundly shown to be the ""bunk"" that it is by numerous middle east archeological discoveries of the 20th century. After reading this ""work,"" I read an extremely well-researched WORK by Josh McDowell, ""Evidence That Demands a Verdict"" Volume II. Anyone foolish enough to write or purchase ""Don't Know Much..."" should also read the book from McDowell. How enlightening true scholarship is when viewed next to Davies' book. At least I can credit Davies with an insightfull title!"
2,Maybe Mr. Davis needs to do some more research,"My guess is that it must have been extremely difficult for Mr. Davis to remain unbiased when writing this book. While he is able to theorize based on other teaching about specific events that occurred in the Old Testament, he fails to use the same kind of reasoning when it applies to the New Testament. It seems that there is no mention about the actual translation of the biblical text referring to fulfilling the Messianic Prophecies nor does he examine the original Hebrew text concerning the writings in Isaiah or Jeremiah. Nor does he give any clear explanation about the miracles Jesus performed or theorize about his resurrection. I think if you cannot separate yourself from your core beliefs, your definition of ""the truth"" remains to be questioned."
2,Bible stories and history from a very cynical point of view.,Davis uses this as a vehicle for communicating his own biases and intolerance for different faiths and viewpoints. Interesting that someone with such an obvious contempt for religion would choose this subject.
3,If you Don't Know Much about the Bible...,"...then get a Bible and read it! Don't let *anybody* tell you what it means; find out for yourself. The New International Version of the Bible (available from Amazon) is clearly written in modern English. As you read it, write down any questions you have. When you've read enough of the Bible that you feel more familiar with it, then that is the time to try to find answers to your questions. You should not read Don't Know Much about the Bible, until you do know much (or more) about it! A strongly opinionated book like this is the absolute wrong thing for someone with little Bible knowledge."
5,Infomative and Fun To Read,"To all of you who swallow whole whatever you hear about the ""Truth"" I challenge you to read this book with an open mind. It will educate, amuse and enlighten you."
4,Excellent popularization of biblical scholarship,"A fascinating, unbiased, and easy-to-read analysis of the bible, unhindered by any presuppositions about the divine nature of the work.An emphasis is placed on understanding the biblical stories in light of current scientific and historical knowledge and against the backdrop of the legends, ideas, and understandings of the ancient near east. Biblical literalists will not be entertained, but the layman with an interest in how the bible came to be and how it influenced, and was influenced by, the people and places of its time, will find this book a delight."
5,A book that tells how the Bible really fits in History!,"Mr. Davis does an excellent job of telling how the Bible fits into History. So many times I have had questions about who really wrote the Bible, and how much of it fits into what we know from History. Most people just say ""God wrote it"". It is the perfect book for people who like to know the facts and don't just blindly follow a religion. Mr. Davis is sensitive to all religions in his book and I feel I could recommend this book to anyone of any religion. It is very interesting , funny, and enlightening. I hope to see more books by this talented teacher. Maybe about the History of Western Civilization."
2,Disappointingly superficial,"Davis gets two stars for his sheer volume of work, but as a serious examination of the bible, this book cannot compare to Isaac Asimov's Guide to the Bible, published in 1981. Davis' analysis is completely superficial and often just relies on summarizing plot lines. Any thoughtful commentary is often quoted verbatim from other, more authoritative sources. His habit of dropping irreverent one-liners (""How do we know Moses was a real man? Lost in the desert for 40 years, he wouldn't stop and ask for directions?"")throughout the text is particularly annoying. If you're looking for a serious scholarship, find an author who takes the bible seriously."
1,He really doesn't know much!,"It's on thing for the author to say he doesn't know much about the Bible, but then he goes about proving it in his book.The premise had potential and the hype surrounding the book made it sound like a fresh take on the Bible--much needed these days. Unfortunately, it just doesn't deliver. I've never been so anxious to get to the apocalypse. By the time I reached the book of Revelations, I was ready for the Second Coming.Definitely browse the book at a store before buying--even if it's on the discount table."
1,A book for people who are gods unto themselves,"Don't buy this book if you love the Bible or want to find out what it has to offer spiritually. This irreverent, materialistic approach is everything BUT what ""what you need to know."" Davis is an historian and a geographer (and no doubt an excellent authority in his field). However, for him to analyze the confusing parts of the Bible from a human point of view is like a third-grader claiming that college is where you go to get away from your mother. Buy a book by someone who is receptive to the Bible's inspiration if you want to find out what it can do for you. Buy THIS book if you want an excuse to believe that millions of people are kidding themselves about feeling uplifted and inspired."
5,Little Charlie Andrews Got It All Wrong...,"This is a great compilation with a superb track listing. Although ""Can't Find The Time"" is a gorgeous song, it is by no means the best track on this CD. My current favorites are ""I've Never Seen Love Like This"" (what a hit!), ""Walk Away Renee"" (The Left Banke version pales in comparison) and ""Tomorrow Man"" (beautiful lyrics).This is one of those CD's that you can play from start to finish without ever using the ""skip"" button. Enjoy!"
3,Uneven,"This is a rather uneven synthesis of the four album career of a cult favorite. Starting the album with ""Can't Find the Time.."" is like putting the jelly on the outside the doughnut. Not much thought went into th construction of this album unfortunately."
2,Small,Smaller than expected. The description is misleading. Suggest giving the dimensions for products like this. Other than that the product is ok.
2,damaged goods,"I would have really liked the DVD collection of their 4th season but even though this was a brand new DVD, the third disc was scratched so that it was not viewable. Upon trying to return it, the third party seller had a 7 day return policy."
4,songs of hope and reality,"Polwart is a really fine singer, indeed, as her days with the Battlefield Band proved. she's just as fine a writer, offering songs that recognize life sometimes -- maybe often-- gives one hard knocks, but there is hope to be found, and courage to be drawn from one's deepest resources. I was first introduced to Polwart's work by Cathie Ryan, who herself has that hope and resilience thing going in her recent work as well. Polwart paints her world with in different hues, but if you like Ryan you should check out Polwart, and vice versa."
3,Paranoia,"Loretta Young got some of her best roles toward the end of her film career, and this was one of them. She stars as the patient and loving wife of Barry Sullivan, a bedridden man who has become paranoid and who manages to implicate her in his own death. Through a winding series of events, she must race against time to save herself from a murder charge. Young is excellent in the role, being given more opportunity to show her dramatic range than in many of the other films she made. The tension builds well and the story manages to remain credible. Although a small film and hardly a classic, it is quite good."
5,Born Again,"Reading this book has help answered so many unanswered question in my life. I truly recommend that if you want to better understand the true words of the gospel then this is the book you should be reading. The bible is the # 1 leading sold book,but I also feel this book should be the # 2 leading sold book. I can't recommend this book enough. Im a Born again Christian but now I am a much wiser Born again for this book has given me the knowledge to better understand the words of God. I pray you wont waste another moment of your life and order this book today. May God Bless you and you family ,Amen"
3,Encontré lo que me hacía falta!,"En este bendito libro encontré lo que me hacía falta. No tenía idea de la importancia del bautismo de Jesús,de manos de Juan en el río Jordán. Ahora se como Jesus absorbió todos los pecados del mundo, pasados, presentes y futuros; pagó por ellos con su sangre en la Cruz, quedando así redimidos todos nuestros pecados.Escrito con claridad y sencillez, de acuerdo a la palabra de Dios. Si quieres nacer de nuevo, reconociendo a Jesús como tu salvador personal, y tener la remisión de todos tus pecados, debes leer este libro."
1,Jesus did not receive the sins of the world at His baptism!,"Jesus could not receive the sins of the world at the time of His baptism. Otherwise, He would have become sin at the beginning of His mission on earth and would have been seperated from His father before His ministry even began. Jesus took the sin of the world upon Him on the cross. He did this when He said,"" My God, My God, why hast thou foresaken Me"". Jesus needed to be without sin as the perfect sacrificial lamb or it would have all been done in vain. The sin of the world caused God the Father to turn His back on the Son thus Jesus words on the cross. After Jesus was baptised, the Holy Spirit decended upon Him like a dove, not sin."
3,fogi is a bastard,"pretty good. ending not clear to me, but still wasn't a bad little study in love/drugs and what we think is happiness."
5,What hapened to Boyett?,"For more information on Boyett and this book, check http://www.msen.com/~yorick/srb_taos.ht"
3,some curse...,"...the vid. quality i have on this dvd is exceptional depending on the manufacturer; i dont remember which i have cuz now im using the usual library pc where the dvd is @ home. im doing this review (sent to me w/o notice from amazon)to get it out of the way now.this movie does need more monster action. it's still one of the best Mexican creature type movies out there but as usual from Them, this still lax some more action & more intelligence-its kinda aggravating. its gotten old always seeing abel salazar in these type films from ""may he co"". (thats mexico.)the ""monster"" scenes i remember are: malnurished boxer like attack dogs, a lg. bat, a sm. regular bat, the creature like locked up/beaten x husband, hunchback like ladys aid & human silhouettes, black eyes, more eyes in special f/x, where the crumbling castle scene @ the end was the best action. the story: kinda hard to follow cuz it was hard to get into-you'll just have to see that ""fo yo self""."
4,"Good CD, but expected a bit more from Dara","I've been looking forward to this CD for a long time. Although Dara picks quality tracks for this mix, a few of them are relatively old and not as refreshing. Not quite the same caliber as ""From Here to There"" but still a solid CD and definately worth the buy for any jungle fan."
4,my review of a future perfect,"theres not just a whole lot to say about this cd. Theres a little bit to be desired in the mixing but his choice of tracks is unbelievable. its awsome if you love drum&bass you gotta check this out. If you have a question about what jungle is or whether or not youll like it get this cd, it will make up your mind for you."
2,Comercialized jungle at it's best!,"I have been a fan of Dara for a while, and was looking forward to this cd until I heard it. This mix is too boring! Almost every track sounds the same. On Dara's old stuff he would use some breaks and some melody, but not here. This cd is actually very typical of most stuff that has come out in the past couple years. The guy that said you can tell that Dara has played alongside Dieselboy is right. This cd is a mirror image of the straight forward [stuff] Dieselboy is limiting himself to nowadays. Instead go to puracidmixtapes website and pick from an assortment of not so comercialized jungle cd's!"
1,Waste of time.,"Absolute waste of time. One of the worst movies of all time regardless of genre. For anyone who is expecting any type of historical context, it is a joke. The acting is on par with an adult film and it pains me to see this being considered a movie about Operation Market Garden. Do yourself a favor and do NOT see this."
1,Annoying message,"My husband bought this and this is his review: The movie was barely ok, such as a low budget hastily filmed ridiculous plot movie is. The main thing that gave this a low rating was the message ""Screener not for sale or rental"" that kept flashing frequently in the picture. I have never encountered one of these ""screening DVD's"" before and was not very happy. I should have been paid to watch this."
1,Worst war movie ever,"Who or whom ever managed to finance, cast, produce and distribute this movie deserves an award. That person could sell ice cubes to eskimos. I thought War Kill with George Montgomery was the all time stinker of war movies until I saw this trash. Michael Madsen must have been really broke to have agreed to be in this film. His appearence was made even worse as his hair was dyed black and I don't think he was wearing a helmet liner as his helmet sat so far down on his head. The allied uniforms were wrong, the plot was lame and the casting, with few exceptions, could have been better accomplished with a dart board. Coral Beed was nice to look at, but that's where the good part of the movie ended. Use the time you might have spent to watch this movie doing something more pleasant, like getting a root canal."
1,I knew this would be awful ...,"... and it was awful. However, I enjoyed it for the unintentionally funny, morally flawed and politically incorrect film that it was. It was truly embarrassing for me to see Billy Zane, Michael Madsen, Laurence Fox, Alexander Skarsgard and ""Rasputin"" involved in such a disaster of epic proportions but my stomach muscles got a great work-out from my frequent, almost seizure-like, bursts of laughter. This film failed on every level - plot, dialog, acting, musical score, and pacing. It's not the worst movie I have ever seen but it could possibly be the worst World War II movie I have ever seen. I'm actually thinking of getting this as a gag gift for my ex-boyfriend who loves this era. As bad as advertised."
3,Better than expected.,"I grabbed this off the shelf of my local rental place because I needed a free non-new release in a hurry. I thought it would be horrible so I was actually surprized to find it half decent and worth a rental. It is a little different take on the War genre with a little Kelleys Heroes thrown in. It will never be a classic like that but it was a good movie that doesn't spoon feed you everything up front. And, unlike Tom Cruise in Valkyre, these mostly B movie actors can actually manage convincing accents! Of course, they are not all American actors anyway which helps with the accent thing."
1,What ever happened to good WWII movies?,"This reviewer has been watching WWII movies for over 40 years, and this movie is without a doubt the absolute WORST I have ever had the displeasure of watching! I don't know who Billy Zane and David Madsen owed favors to but I think it is safe to say that the favor has been returned in spades! This movie is so flawed that I don't know where to begin. It looks like it was filmed in about a day and a half. It is lacking in plot, storyline, continuity, etc. Even the slightest attempt at a believeable concept was not attempted. I doubt that even Speilberg could salvage such a piece of crap!"
2,Plot Fizzles...,"This WWII action flick obviously made with a low budget shows promise at first. Using some crafty photography incorporated with a gritty opening battle scene, keeps the viewer on edge. The stage is set competently enough for a Dutch treasure heist.About a half hour into the movie, silly dialogue and lousy actingmar the whole plot. Michael Madsen's role as an American commander is so insignificant that there is no doubt that his career has gone south. This movie makes ""Kelly's Heroes""(The ultimate WWII heist movie) seem like Oscar material."
1,Very poor movie,"One of the worst WWII movies I've ever seen and I watch every one that is released. Terrible sound track, poor audio mixing, hard rock in the music score, disrespectful of German, American and British troops. Billy Zane was the only actor that was close to properly cast for the part, the remainder of the cast are good actors, but not in this movie. If you know nothing of the WWII era and of WWII and you like movies were there is nothing close to the good guy, you'll like this movie."
1,Didn't know whether it was comedy or drama,"This film would have made a poor, but not terrible, drama, had they elected to play it straight. But they didn't. They made it part comedy, so what you get is a very odd, confused film that doesn't know what it wants to be. You don't know whether you're supposed to laugh or cry. Mostly, you just fast-forward.Others have commented on the lack of historical authenticity, but one thing they got right was the look and feel of the German machine guns. Those German machine guns had an incredibly high rate of fire that was well in advance of anything the British or Americans had at that time."
4,how to preserve your expensive dental fixed bridges,I have a dental bridge and have prescribed these for 30 plus years in my dental practice in various locations
3,good product expensive shipping,"I ordered these floss threaders because my convenient local shopping does not stock this item, and none like it. I was going to get a larger amount product but I already had a pricey order so I opted for these to get through the holidays.This product is a 5 star product but the shipping cost $2.20 and the product cost $2.09. These small items, whoever is responsible for FREE SHIPPING, should be all on free shipping. Somehow get the product to Amazon so an order can be put in one box or for free shipping or a multiple pack load.Once again, the product is 5 star, but the shipping is too high for one small item."
4,Read her other Hypnobirthing book instead,"Many of you mentioned that this book is meant to be a companion to the Hypnobirthing class and b/c of that you felt you were missing information.... The book that is more comprehensive is _Hypnobirthing: The Mongan Method_. It does explain things more fully with diagrams, etc. Check out that one and the user reviews there. It's really helpful."
2,Mia Luna,"Instead of this book try Hypnobabies, they have a VERY complete Home Study Course and also offer live classes across the USA and even in Australia. This book is meant to accompany the live classes."
4,A brilliant resource,"I aquired this book when a friend whom I had helped several times professionally as a hypnotherapist asked me to help her prepare for natural child birth.The book proved invaluable not only in the way it assisted in the deprogramming of the negative expectations and fear of chilbirth pervading our culture, but also as a basis of ideas from which to negotiate and plan a bespoke approach to preparing her and her birth team for the big event.It's not complete in itself and really does need to be used by someone competent in hypnosis, (we used other techniques form other disciplines as well) but it's a superb resource and I envision recommending it to many more people.And by the way, my friend felt no need to use pain relief, reported no pain, only ""sensations"", and she wasn't in any way attempting to mask the pain and the midwfe recorded second stage as lasting approximately 2 minutes!"
3,Satisfied,"Very interesting but for critical matters, information that you really need, the book often refers to a hypnobirthing class while that information could easily be explained in the book with a few drawings (massage) or detailed explanation (breathing technique). It's a bit frustrating when you live in a country where there is no hypnobirthing class available: with the book you're informed that there are manners to avoid discomfort but you can't get the complete information because you have no chance to attend the hypnobirthing classes and in the meanwhile you know that this information could easily have been written down..."
3,"great breathing techniques, but wastes 50 pages describing problems in modern cultures attitude toward birthing","specific visualizations to relax and help the baby descend. the first half is so boring, trying to convince me of what i already know, to use hypnobirthing! hello! i bought the book! just get to it. dont need a history of whats wrong with our cultures approach to birthing. also, it could have a checklist of which visualizations and techniques to use at each stage of delivery. confusing to know which breathing techniques to use when. im not taking a class along with this and i dont have a doula or parnter to help me. i wish thed update the book."
3,HYPNOBIRTHING A CELEBRATION of LIFE,I found the book disorganized and a bit fluff filled.I expected something more to grasp on to. This is my second baby so I have read alot.Not a good grasp of the material.
2,Probably works better w/ the CDs and classes,"My sister-in-law referred this book to me. She also took the classes with her husband and listened to the CDs, which I did not. I barely made it through this book. It was just too cheesy and hippie-ish for me. I'm sure if I would have been more committed to this child bearing method and had taken the classes, I would have found it much more useful, but just by itself, it didn't do it for me.My sister-in-law had her baby doing Hypnobirthing last week and she and her husband had a great experience. Again, I'm sure you need the classes, CDs and lots of practice for the book to be useful."
1,hypnobirthing a celebration of life,Bits and pieces of other peoples information. not a good grasp of the subject. Fortunately I could tell at first glance that this is a meager attempt to introduce hypnosis without much substance .Poorly written. Jamie
2,"no explanation of how to use,confusing","as a physician I found this not very ,clear, and not specific enough. I found the Hypnobirthing method by a PhD, R.N. much more knowledgeable and helpful. This apparently is written by a lay hypnotist with no awareness of a woman's psyche during pregnancy and birth. Leclaire obviously has a grasp of what it takes. Sorry, I felt I had to let the public know. Stick with those in the know. Sincerely, Kay"
2,Hypnobirthing a celebration,"A regurgitation of other hypnosis materials without the understanding of the birthing process.As my mid wife said ""HYPE No Birthing""Poorly written. Alice"
2,Poor performance of the lovely concerto,"This is Nishizaki's 7th recording of the famous Chinese violin concerto -- and of the five recordings from her I've heard, the worst. The pace is too slow, and, unlike in her previous performance, Nishizaki did not employ techniques derived from the Chinese instrument erhu, techniques necessary to give the concerto the perfect blend of East and West. Her playing sounds almost perfunctory, disinterested, lazy. The orchestra does a fine job, but since this concerto is all about the soloist, the performance sucks.Breiner's 8-piece suite based on Chinese melodies from the Silk Road is disappointingly banal and nothing more than an album filler.I only give this CD 2 stars because the concerto is so beautiful. (BTW, the SACD versions have great sound.)"
5,It is a crying shame this book is out of print.,"Collins's book is an excellent introduction to biblical exegesis. Covers the basics -- text criticism, form criticism, etc. -- in a clear and readable style. Presents good examples, and also discusses the various codices, their late discovery compared to the KJV, and impact on biblical scholarship. I have read enough biblical criticism to recognize a classic when I see one. Collins is, as I recall, a priest, so he is not hostile to the subject, nor offensive to the believer. He just presents the nature and results of good scholarly criticism. If only someone would put this out in paperback! This book started me on a 5 year exploration. If you are lucky, it will be at a library near you."
5,Shades Apart - the best band you never heard of!,"I came across this band by accident, stumbling onto their last CD - Eyewitness. By the fourth track, they were officially my favorite band. If you loved Eyewitness as much as I did, you'll be happy with the band's most recent CD - Sonic Boom. The songs Beat by Beat, Shockwave, & Gravity are great no-nonsense rock songs. The ballad Three Wishes is sure to please. And track 5, Got Shot Down, absolutely RULES - you won't be able to get it out of your head. It is trademark Shades Apart - high energy and raw passion combined with great musicianship, clever lyrics, and a catchy tune. So if you're like me and can't fathom why Eyewitness wasn't a platinum album, you'll love Sonic Boom. And if you never heard Eyewitness, then for Pete's sake buy both CD's - you won't regret it."
4,Left a sonic boom in my cd case,"All I can say is WOW! I bought this album with high expectations, and they were exceeded. From song one, the tone was set. Get ready to listen to rock the way it should be: volume UP, and your head a baggin'! Beat by Beat is my favorite song on this cd, so if you dont like that one, then you wont like this cd."
3,"good band good music overall, but BAD vocal","I like the composing, somehow surprising me.The emotion of voice iS almost the same in every song that makes this album a little boring...listen to each song seperately may be better."
4,Specialist/Generalist,"I think this book is filled with the content for a specialist cognitive oriented crowd, but written for a generalist audience. I find this a blessing as it is easy to read yet does not walk away from technical descriptions. Each chapter (and section) is highly readable keeping in mind that this is an academic text.Basically Churchland shows how cognition can be broken down into neural correlates. I learned more than anticipated (i.e. intricacies of the human auditory system, and stereoscopic vision: and comes with lenses to try out seeing in stereo). He looks at the perceived reality/or the reality as observed from the sensory system and then explains it from possible root anatomy. Fun to think about. I think that the book is more of a reference for me as I spot read this one from time to time and have never made it from cover to cover - BUT, imagine some could.For those interested in the philosophy of cognitive science or in cognitive science this is a good find."
2,"Beware, ALL beginners!","I bought this title recently in the hope it would take the strain out of drawing the human form. Alas, how wrong I was. Although Burne Hogarth is an excellent artist with exceptional ability, this book just makes things more daunting, especially for the beginner. His methods for drawing the human figure is so complex, it defies belief! His technique may work like magic for him a few others but for us mere mortals, his way will make you want to give up drawing right away. Unless you have extensive drawing training at a high level, leave this book until much later. Although a high quality book with sound knowledge, it's usability is practically zero."
2,Not for every artist,"This book does not show you how to draw in the least bit. It is very vague when it comes to how the human anatomy works when it comes to muscle structure and movement, it does not walk you step by step through drawing a figure. What this book does explain that is helpful is perspective and that is about it. If you are a beginner or even a novice, this book may be good for reference by looking at his work, but the reading and looking at the different poses he presents is mundane and boring beyond belief. I strongly disagree with anyone who lays claim that this is a Figure Drawing book. Look this book over carefully in a store before purchasing as it's definately not for anyone who is looking for examples on how to draw the human body."
5,Awesome Book,"I've yet to really read through this book, but I'm already a fan. I've never really purchased many art books, or how-to art books, but that's usually because the illustrions in them leave much to be desired. It may just be my personal taste, but I really like the style in which these illustrations were done. The drawings themselves are very cool, and I'd love to learn how to capture the human frame as the writer has.There also seems to be a wealth of knowledge in this book. It's respectably hefty, and appears to be full of great tips and suggestions. I'd definitely order this item again, even if just for the illustrations."
5,A must have book for artist or those who want to draw.,This book is great!! The best i've seen on the human figure.It explains the human figure with examples from drawings don't by Hogarth. The explanation of the human body in 3D is important in getting the figure to not look flat. The process of learning proportions of the body before getting into detail is helpful. This book will help artist learn to draw without a real life model. If you can draw the human figure you can draw anything as figure drawing covers the basics needed to be a great artist. Best figure drawing book out there with ease of explaination that is sure to improve your figure drawing.
1,Yech!,"Since when does Dynamic = Preposterous, Awkward and Just Plain Silly? I would not recommend this to anyone who is serious about improving their drawing abilities...Maybe to the animators of Dragonball Z, though."
5,Burne Hogarth will change the way you view art and figures,"Burne Hogarth is one of the only artists who addresses a question that every aspiring artist asks but only the seasoned artists can answer - how do I get a body to look like it takes up volume? Sure, we all know 8 heads per figure and such rules as that but to get a truly dynamic picture that jumps off the page, looking at Mr. Hogarth's work is an excellent way to start. I guarentee that you will look at your drawings, others' drawings and lines in a whole new way."
4,Interesting Anatomy Showcase,"Very well drawn figures with insightful commentary help the reader learn interesting ways of drawing anatomy using not only drawings but words aswell.I recommend this book to my friends, and to you too. If you want clean drawings and well worded analysis, then this is the book for you."
4,Fun and pretty useful drawing practice,"I used this book to practice the essentials of human figures drawing. Book teaches you systematically fundamentals by showing the proportions of each possible action figures and helps you to visualize the human body in almost every possible form. In case you don't have a model, it is very helpful for improving your drawing skills by going through every page and sketching each possible action form."
4,A GREAT REFERENCE FOR DRAWING,This book has help me with my figure drawing a great deal. I see a big difference in my art work.This book is in my top 5 try it it doe's the body good!!! see ya...
4,Good Looking and Warm Jacket,"This is a good looking, simple cut jacket.I purhased it when living in northern New York, where various layering was useful.It is warm and can be used as an outer jacket or as an inner, under layer.I use it for both. I like the crew neck because it's comfortabe when layering or driving my truck.It has a standard zipper, crew neck and crew wrist. It has no crew waist, which I like if I'm driving.It's warm and comfortable when I 'm driving around."
3,only if your desparate,"I am only egg intolerant, not allergic. Adding this to my oatmeal cookie recipe today resulted in dry dough and crumby cookies. It's barely okay. Additionally, I'd rather do without all that soy. A better subsitute in most cases is 1 Tbsp sour cream per egg. This works especially well in pancakes/waffles and crepes! Glad I only got a sampling of the powder instead of an expensive pound or two!"
4,"Good, but perhaps buying in bulk is a mistake...","This was the first egg replacer I used after I found out that my toddler was allergic to eggs. I have made everything from banana bread to pancakes and casseroles with it and everything has turned out perfectly...until this winter. Suddenly everything I made with the replacer tasted terrible to me, even when I opened a new package and threw out the old. I am not sure what the shelf life of this product is, but mine seemed to go bad within 6 months of purchase. I easily went through one package in that time, but there is no way I could have gotten through four packages! I would recommend this product, but only if you do enough eggless baking to get through all four packages within six months."
2,Warning: may contain nuts,"According to the label, this egg replacer is made in a factory that processes peanuts and nuts. Since I am looking for ingredients for a person with both egg and nut allergies, this is not the one I can use. Orgran or Ener-G, however, are nut free...."
1,BEWARE!,"My husband ordered one of these for me as a gift. It says nothing in the description about being filled with lavender, but when it arrived, you could definitely tell it was! As I am very scent sensitive, it had to be returned. So, if you are sensitive to perfumes and scents, do not buy this product!It would be nice if Amazon would provide this information, but since they do not, I will."
1,NO MORE,"This is one of three Girls Gone Wild that I own and there will be no more.It is for all intents and purposes the same old same old. Back in the mid eighties, I rented 4 or 5 Hard core porn flicks to see what they were all about. I came to the same conclusion, that they were all pretty much alike and this is pretty much the case with Girls Gone Wild. This format was probably good for only a few videos, but has kept on going. The only thig new that I have seen is Girls Gone Wild Games, which was different to some degree. I have had more than my fill of this junk and will not purchase anymore. Charlie S."
5,"Solid foam, fun shapes",These shapes are surprisingly solid and substantial. Our 18-month old son enjoys stacking and playing with them. He occasionally chews on them but the foam is hard enough to discourage damage. This is a unique type of foam you do not normally encounter in toys. These shapes have last a while and continue to get good use.
4,Russian nights,"Is very nice, and technically well done. I like too, the big difference in price. May be I am not so refined to have only high priced versions of I like. I am satisfied...."
1,Unreliable switch with very poor technical support,"I purchased two of the EF4124 24-port switches for my small business. Within a week, one switch went bad. If nothing was plugged in port # 1, everyone lost their connection. When I disconnected all the cables and turned it back on, 4 ports still showed to be active. The same thing happend to the second switch about two weeks later. After waiting on hold for an hour, they said someone would call the following day because they were to busy to help me. Not holding my breathI have used Linksys for many years with very few problems. I will not purchase their products again."
1,We've stopped buying linksys,"Linksys appears to be riding on their reputation. During the 1990s, their stuff was top notch and we bought nothing but Linksys. Then, they were purchased by Cisco, and their quality appears to have nosedived since then.We had the exact same experience as another poster, with indicator lights remaining on after the plugs were pulled from the corresponding sockets, and within a day, the whole unit died.We've stopped buying Cisco/Linksys and found Netgear products to be what Linksys used to be: well made at attractive prices. I'd suggest anyone looking to purchase Linksys products look into Netgear instead."
1,Unstable,"These switches are unstable. Wiggle a wire, and half of the switch will crash. May work fine for months at a time, then partially crash... When crashed some ports still work, while other's don't.Not worth the trouble."
1,Poor quality Switch,Died today after under 2 years of service. That's pretty terrible for a basic piece of equipment. I have switches from 15 years ago that still work fine.Had to reset the switch fairly often(every 4 months or so). Drove me nuts making me think our DSl modem or Cisco router was buggy. Would work for a while and then just stop passing traffic.Buy from someone else.
1,Bad quality product,Same thing here like previous posts.Two of them died in past 4 years.Poor quality.Do not buy this product.
1,These Do Not Fit My Sunbeam Mixmaster,"The beaters are not exactly as pictured, and they do not fit the Sunbeam Mixmaster (Model MMB) very well. They will not lock into position. It is possible to use them if you can lower the mixer head before they slide out of position, but when you raise the head, you have to catch the beaters or they will plop right into your batter. They are SLIGHTLY better than the old, bent beaters with the popped rivets that I was trying to replace, but they are not really a suitable replacement. By the way, my old beaters DO lock into place properly, so the fault does not seem to be with the mixer itself."
2,Beaters do not fit mixmaster.,Of course you cannot find beaters to fit the mixmaster because Sunbeam wants you to purchase a brand new one... shameful that you cannot find replacement parts when there is absolutely nothing wrong with the mixmaster.
2,Falls Short,"If you are looking for a biography of James Madison, look elsewhere. Rutland's subtitle, ""The Founding Father,"" makes it clear what this book is about: Madison's participation in the creation and passage of the constitution and the Bill of Rights. Although it does cover most of his life, the focus is definitely on Madison's role as founding father.The book deals with the major issues of Madison's political life, often in too minute detail, but does not satisfy the biographical aspects of his life. There is absolutely no mention, for example, of Madison's birth date, or even the year he was born in! Further, the book failed completely to engage me. I set it aside for weeks at a time before I finally finished if off, despite its modest size."
3,"New thoughts, views on President Madison","Interesting bio of an important Founding Father. The Constitution and much of they way we are governed today comes from James Madison. The first half of his public service made his reputation. Based on the last 12 years of his public life, his decisions almost destroyed his reputation as the original flip flopper. He was against the National Bank before he was for it. He was for going to war with France before deciding to war with England. He was for the Embargo of 1808 before he was against it. Interesting views and thoughts by the writer."
4,James Madison,"The War of 1812 was fought with Great Britain. The British captured Washington, D.C., and burned the White House. Madison fled. He is known as the father of the Constitution and wrote the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is the first 10 Amendments. The first Amendment guarantees free speech."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. A book with this kind of title & a ghost on the front should have some spooky stories. It read more like an encyclopedia. Things were listed in a boring, plain way, & most of them had nothing scary about them. I learned a few interesting things about Mammoth Cave, but could have gotten that from a book about the cave. The few stories that were at all spooky, were told in such a bland manner, just a few sentences stating the main points, that it was impossible to feel anything from them. If you're looking for Mammoth Cave knowledge, get a book on the cave. If you want scary cave stories try ""Tales of Dirt, Danger & Darkness"" by Paul Stewart. If this book had told the spooky things in a ""story"" manner, some of them might have been interesting. But most of them were too short to really be a story."
5,Devlishly Delightful Book,"Masterfully written, this little book recounts many stories of ghost sightings and other chilling encounters, some fictional and others unexplained, that have occurred over the known history of Mammoth Cave. The book is a nice sampler written in an understated manner that makes for a spine-tingling read. Highly recommended reading for young and old alike."
4,Scary Stories of Mammoth Cave,"This is a delightful little book of stories about strange and unusual or unexplained happenings in Mammoth Cave. Not only is Mammoth Cave the World's longest cave, it has been heavily visited since about 1800. The cave was also heavily visited by Native Americans, some of whom were buried in the cave and later found as mummies by the saltpeter miners.This collection of stories recalls things that happened to the saltpeter miners during the War of 1812 and to the tourists and guides who came later. Some stories are by more recent explorers who encountered strange happening on their trips. This book provides an interesting and somewhat unusual side of the history of Mammoth Cave.No, these stories won't keep you from going to sleep at night. Stephen King is in no danger. But, they are entertaining and I enjoyed reading them. Even better, I know some of the explorers in some of the stories !!!Larry E. MatthewsProfessional Geologist"
3,Disappointed,The machine does everything that I wanted it to do except the audible signal is at such a high pitch you can hardly hear it. I called the tech line and was told the signal should be loud. I returned it for a replacement but had the same problem. If they improved the audible signal tone it would be a great machine.
3,If you like old style vampire movies,"This movie is a typical old school for of vampire tale. Where the characters involved don't know how is the vampire, but, we the viewer know immediately. Lovely women, a vampire out for some blood, bad translation. But, its a relic and that's why I love it...."
1,Not in the original language as advertised by Amazon,The Amazon webpage advertises this film on dvd as available in Spanish .IT ISN'T which is too bad since the drama and the acting reflect fatalism and tragedy .Let's hope that Casa Negra or Imagine put out a good edition of this so that we can get the context of the film
4,A Good Concert from a Remarkable Band,"Strawbs Live in Tokyo '75 is a treasure in that it is probably the only live video recording of the greatest Strawbs line-up, featuring Dave Cousins, Dave Lambert, John Hawken, Chas Cronk and Rod Coombes. Cuts like Down By the Sea, New World and Hero and Heroine are stand-out tracks and make this a must-own for Strawbs fans. The extra bonus full-feature film of the earlier Grave New World album (which was created as the first-ever film of an album intended for play in cinema theaters) makes this an even more important record of a great band."
4,The Real Deal,"The Tokyo show features THE classic lineup of the prog version of the Strawbs (and they have reunited, BTW, to play this year's Nearfest - already sold out - and a few other gigs). The sound quality is mediocre and the mix is less than great (the mellotron in ""Grave New World"" is completely buried) but Dave Cousins sounds terrific and the entire band play very tightly. The GRAVE NEW WORLD album video is interesting, definitely worth seeing. It DOES contain some cringe-worthy dated imagery but as an historical document is of interest nonetheless. Oddly, they leave off ""Queen of Dreams"", making it an incomplete incarnation of the album. The other extras are fun as well, and for any Strawbs fan this is a necessary purchase."
4,The Strawbs,"I have always loved The Strawbs since Hero and Heroine. And it's only recently on Amazon that I have been able to reconnect to them again. Buying in CD form, reissues of classic albums. Bursting At The Seams, Grave New World for example.Never having seen them live, this footage is great in that it took me back to a time when I believe The Strawbs were a formidable force.The Japan concert footage just post Hero and Heroine is better than I expected.And I really enjoyed, except for the inevitable drum solo which was kind of the norm at the time and feels dated.We receive as extras precious footage of the Grave New World film which has a very young Dave Cousins and looks a bit dated yet. And yet the music is beautiful and it is the beginning of a great and somewhat forgotten band.I hope I am wrong."
1,Where's my purchase?,The Strawbs: Live in Tokyo '75/Grave New World: The MovieI simply didn't receive my purchase so how can I review it?
3,Ok for shipping scale but not other uses,The fit and finish of the scale is great. We purchased the scale based off the product specs stating that it had and accuracy of .05 kg or 50 grams and fit our max weight limit. We planned to use the scale in an industrial applicaton to weigh material being added to the scale throughout the day. We were disappointed that the scale did not register any weight until exceeding 200 grams! We contacted the company and they said that the model we purchased was not as advertised. At this point they plan to work with us to exchange for a scale that is truly able to measure 50 grams. Bottom line - Scale would be great for a shipping but not for any other detailed weighing.
2,Received broken; late shipment,"This item was supposed to be received within 1 business day. I ordered this on Friday and did not receive it until Wednesday. I requested expedited shipping, but received this 3 days later.The packaging was insufficient when I received the scale. It was broken. I sent this back and requested another unit, but they were out of stock. They're not very helpful on the customer service side."
3,Weigh Scale,"Not a good functional product. The scale is constructed very solid with its remote digital reader, but sometimes it won't work"
1,"Was broken, couldn't use it","Opening the box the scale came in. It looked brand new, but parts were not level. The manufacture over tightened the screws to the point they damaged the scale."
5,"Robert Frost, the poet for poetry lovers","I have read Robert Frost's poetry for years. There's nothing better than being curled up on the sofa on a cold afternoon drinking hot cocoa, and browsing through a Robert Frost poem book to warm your heart. For years I had been looking for a complete collection of Robert Frost's poems. I'm glad I found it a Amazon."
2,Trite and banal,"I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding.Bad poetry from a twisted man."
2,Funny shape,"The hat has a funny shape. It's not my head, as other hats fit just fine, but I can't seem to get this one to conform to the shape of my head. Consequently I don't wear it very often. It looks even sillier on me since my hair is so short. Ah, well, at least I like what it says."
2,Disappointed,Zipper broke within first few uses :( It's fine for cash and a credit card but doesn't easily fit keys or anything that isn't flat...
1,Product does NOT deliver,"The Linksys WRT51AB does not deliver at all. Using the 802.11A radio, we've experienced nothing but lockups. The router locks up which then locks up the computers attached to the point the keyboard and mouse do not respond. With the cards set for ad-hoc and the router unplugged, the network runs fine. Three months of constant contact with Tech Support has netted us repeated canned responses that do not resolve the issue. Please, do not buy this product. I am a certified network engineer with 12 years experience. I tried more possible solutions than Linksys script monkeys can offer."
1,This LINKSYS product is the worst networking product ever,"This thing crashes and reboots every 10-15 minutes. In case you are thinking you'll just upgrade the firmware, LinkSys has not provided a firmware update to date. I've been working with computers and networking equipment for more than 25 years and never seen anything this bad. DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER!!!"
1,Very bad wireless experience,"Do you want to spend 3 hours on the phone with India tech support restarting your computer, upgrading firmware levels, cycling your DSL modem and being fed useless platitudes?I did - and eventually decided to return this garbage and go with a different brand.I have a new IBM Centrino XP Pro laptop. When I connected to the router through wireline I could get an internet connection, but as soon as I enabled wireless on the router, my whole network was put out of action. Linksys insisted I must have a problem with the laptop, but it works fine when I connect to T-Mobile at Starbucks. Reading some of the other product reviews it is clear to me that Linksys has some serious problems with their wireless products.Shame, I bought my first Linksys product back in 1999, and I used to love the brand."
2,Ugh - Absence of Tech Support & Product Quality,"I got my 802.11AB router and it works fine to the internet, but I can't get access to my VPN server (for work). This is the simplest of advanced functions and worked on my other two routers (D-Link & Netgear) without a hitch. I've bounced back and forth with ""tech support"" for 2+ weeks now to no avail. Too bad, great concept - needs better execution."
4,Good reference,"This book is a great reference for Charleston history, though does read like a history textbook. It is a bit detailed for a reader with a casual interest in the city, but if you are looking for a complete history then this book is for you!"
3,OK in parts. Dry. Lot of interesting facts.,"I'm an armchair history buff, but not a historian. This book was pretty ""to the point"" (thus the name) and interesting from the beginning through the 19th century, but the 20th century components were not compelling to me.The book was dry. I'd recommend it if you are preparing for a visit to Charleston -otherwise find something else to read."
5,BUY THIS BOOK,"THESE REVIEW BOOKS ARE SUCH A GREAT HELP. I USE ON FOR EVERY CLASS THAT REQUIRES A REGENTS EXAM. THEY ARE GREAT, THEY ARE SO RESOURCEFUL. THEY ARE A HUGE HELP WHEN STUDING!"
2,wish the squares have enough space for at least four pawns at a time,"The squares can only fit one pawn at a time. I wish the squares are larger, or the pawns are smaller. When more than one kids arrive at the same square, they tend to bicker about whose pawns should be in the square. Else the kids need to remember at which squares they are at.Instead of using the pawns, I use buttons of different shapes/colors to resolve this issue."
4,pretty good game.......................,"Chutes and Ladders (Dora) is and ok/pretty good game. we have this and Dora Candyland. There are 4 player pieces: Dora, Diego, Boots, and Backpack."
3,Useful for treadmill workout!,"I found this useful for my treadmill workout. I would raise and lower the incline when given the ""difficulty"" of each mountain trek the commentator was climbing. I think there were eleven in all.The scenery was nice and so was the history, but the commentator was not an invigorating speaker. This was more like an amateurs youtube video."
5,Dock Of The Bay / Definitive Collection (IMPORT) ~ Otis Redding,"Otis Redding was and is still a major force when it comes to soul music. His vocals are tremendous and one can not listen to this album without thinking what could have been if he had not tragically died 1967. The vocals were and are some of the best in the business and his lyrics are well written and have meaning without sounding trite. (sittin' on) the dock of the bay is his signature song but there are many other tracks that are on the same level, like mr pitiful, hard to handle and many others. The book-let for this definite collection is well done and the font selected is right on the mark and the photo on the cover is well done and shows a contemplative young otis redding. The story in the book-let is amazing and one starts to think what could have been if he had lived even today as he would just have turned a bit over 60."
1,Lorex Customer Service,"Lorex does not respond to customer information requests for help with their products. I would not, under any circumstances buy from this company."
3,Predictable,"When Charlotte's husband, Peter is killed in a car crash in Brussels, where they were stationed with his company, she takes on a massive burden of guilt. Life with Peter has been cold and loveless as he married her, purely to spite his unforgiving parents. On the very morning of the accident, she had asked him for a divorce so that she might return to her family in England. He flatly refused, and set off on a car trip in an agitated state, leaving her with the guilt that she was the cause of his death. Returning to England, she buys a small cottage near her parents and sister and lets the attached Granny flat to an interesting man in his thirties. The remainder of the story is fairly predictable and includes an amiable vicar, the village gossip, the village sleaze, misunderstandings and happy endings. It's a pleasant story if a bit Mills and Boon."
5,a book for all,"From a multitude of perspectives (student, teacher, communicator, lover of the environment), this book speaks to the reader not only on a knowledge-based, fact-oriented level, but also (and possibly more importantly) to the most basic and essential needs of humanity. These needs include compassion, understanding, sustainability, and harmony and through the book, are translated into a sense of awakening, comprehension, hope, and tools to shape a universal ideal for a world in which we all hope to live. If there were ever to be a ""required life text"", I can only hope that this would be it."
5,A hidden gem,"This book is an exceptional book covering not just ecology as a science but also the need for humans to awaken to earth's beauty, its Being, and our relationship to it. The book is not a radical environmental one where humans must go back to tribal living, but a very thought out and even carrying book. It belongs on the shelf of humanistic and transpersonal students as well as integral philosophers. The only bad thing about the book is that it is so unknown."
1,I would not purchase this phone again.,"I purchased two of these phones along with the base unit a year and a half ago. First, it is difficult to hear and and volume control has only 4 settings and the highest setting not nearly loud enough to hear others. Second, even after keeping the phones in their cradles all the time they still run down very quickly. Last but not least, the LCD display does not display all the pixels and it is difficult to read the caller ID due to this fact. Several rows of pixels are missing on one unit and several columns of pixels are missing on the other. This is very dissapointing.Therefore I would not purchase this product again."
3,Great features; poor sound quality,"These have all the great features that I needed: 5.8 GHZ; speaker phone in each handset; capacity to have 6 or more handsets; no answering machine (didn't need it). However, the sound quality is not great. Sometimes I have a very hard time understanding what people are saying - especially if they have any sort of accent. One other feature that is only a minor annoyance - the autodial numbers you save in a handset are not synchronized with all the phones. You have to re-enter the numbers for each phone."
1,extra phone handset,I ORDERED THIS CORDLESS HANDSET A FEW WEEKS AGO. IT CAME SOON AFTER PLACING THE ORDER AND THE PRODUCT IS VERY SATISFACTORY.
4,Cordless Accessory Telephone Handset,The handset connected immediately after charging the battery with the base. It seems to function just as it is supposed to function.
2,Something Wrong,I added this to our existing base unit (same type). The range on the new extra handset is significantly less than the original unit. We are sending it back to Motorola (good support) for replacement.
2,Handset will not charge,"Have owned this phone for only 3 weeks and now the handset will not charge. It appears that the cordless cradle is not getting power for some reason (and yes, I tried other outlets in the house). What really irks me is that Motorola expects me to pay for shipping to send their defective phone back, AND they won't send me a replacement until they receive the defective one back. I thought these guys were a Six Sigma company? It really bothers me that a company sells you a defective product and on top of it, I get the inconvenience of having to re-package it, drive to the post office, and pay for shipping. Not impressed."
1,this phone sucks,"I can only echo all the negative reviews others have listed, (i.e. handset not charging, lack of signal range, counter inuitive ringing, difficulty transferring calls in house, interruption on phone line, etc. ) and can only add that you not buy these for your work."
2,Phone wont dial normal. Another piece of garbage thrown at us!,"This is a pity. I really thought I finally found a decent phone, and that Motorola made much better then all the known garbage made by ATT, V teck, GE, Southwestern bell, etc.Until.... After only two weeks the phone could not dial normally. It only recorder the second digit I entered, etc.So back to Target it went. Instead I brought a PANASONIC 2.4 GHz. I believe Panasonic is the only one out there with pretty decent phones in today's market.To the credit of this phone I must say, all the other problems mentioned here, like clarity, reception, etc. I DID NOT have with this phone. Though I am happy it turned out so fast what a piece of garbage it is, while still holding on to the receipt!"
1,Do Not Buy This Phone,"3 reasons to not buy this phone.1. I bought this package and carefully reviewed it to make sure I was getting a phone and not an expansion phone. I took it home and found that I had bought the expansion phone. So much for clear packaging.2. I buy the base phone so now I got 2 phones. Unless they are within 20 feet of each other the reception does not work. Fortunately, you can expand the system to 8 phones. Everyone needs 8 phones in a 20 foot radius.3. I know ""retro"" is in but I don't think the designers of this phone meant it to be retro. This phone is big and clunky and cheap. The battery door will not close correctly. Who designed this piece of junk? This is an embarrassment to USA engineering."
2,Disapointed,"This is a good phone but the battery life is really short. All the other features of the phone are up to the standard that I would expect from Motorola. Very disapointed in the battery life. With about an hour of use, the batery charge indicator in almost exhausted."
2,Not Suited for Jeep Wrangler Sahara,"This product will not work properly with the JEEP WRANGLER SAHARA, I purchased it and had to do significant modifications to get it to function properly with our New Jeep Wrangler Sahara.The attachment point to the hitch is too short, the unit bumps up against the spare tire and will not properly pin.To make matters worse the tilt feature does not tilt far enough to avoid the tail gate when opening.Hence, if not extremely skilled in metal working you will be disappointed."
4,Very Pleased,"This rack is awesome. It has everything you need built into it from adjustments to security I have been very pleased. Bungies be gone....It keeps the bikes from swaying, holds all angles and shapes of tubes with every angle, spacing, ect. being easy to adjust and locking once the built in straps are closed around the bike. The security locks for the bikes and the car bring peace of mind when parking around town with a loaded rack, and the folding features are great.The best improvement I think that could be made is the bolt which tightens the rack down through the hitch. It would be much better if this was a pin or hand mechanism which did not require a tool. A second improvement would be that the hitch reciever portion folds up for more compact storage, and third feature to add would be lengthen the arms so a fifth bike could be added as an option."
4,"A Legend, a Shooting Star","An authorized release from the Bolin family, the material is the second of two albums that focuses on Tommy Bolin's debut solo effort Teaser through alternate takes, unreleased selections from the sessions, plus several cuts recorded live.Teaser (1975) was Bolin's the critically-acclaimed debut solo effort which was inexplicably released in conjunction with Deep Purple's Come Taste the Band. Bolin was the guitarist for Deep Purple and his contractual obligations with the band prevented him from promoting Teaser through a concert tour.The four alternate takes are for The Grind, People People, Homeward Strut and Lotus. The five cuts from the sessions lean heavily on blues-rock jams, with the standout being Bagitblues Deluxe. The trio of live selections feature Bolin jamming to the point of tearing the roof off the venue.Bolin passed away in December 1976 at the age of 25. The collection shows Bolin at the height of his creative powers before the personal demons consumed him."
4,very enjoyable,"Alternate takes from the teaser album, studio jams and some live takes.booklet is full of picturesNot as good as volume I, but worth having nonetheless."
3,Good collection,"Good collection of songs, but the insert is rather unprofessional. More pics than text, and even a couple of shots from his Deep Purple days... not 100% off, but I thought this was a Tommy Bolin compilation?"
3,"GOOD MUSIC, POOR PACKAGING","The liner notes on this CD are essentially devoid of any reference to dates, places, or personel. Instead, you get pages of photos. While the music is good, the lack of context is annoying. Even if the information was unavailable to the producer it would have been nice to have known that."
4,Bluebirds Forever,Very helpful as I am doing research on bluebird habitats. Also a lovely book for any wildlife library.
1,Unreliable product,"I installed one of these units in my Chesapeake Virginia home about two years ago. I moved and rented the property a year later. The N210 is great ""when it works"", however, reliability is an issue. Three weeks ago my tenants informed me that there was a problem with the hot water. I went and checked that all electrical connections were tight, and reseated the optocoupler microcircuits on the controller board. The unit worked for another two weeks and then failed again. The manufacturer says that, if I send them the unit, they will refurbish it and give me another 1 year warrantee. That's great... but what are my tenanats supposed to do for the week (or so) that the unit is at the manufacturer? The regrettable solution was to remove the N210 and replace it with a tank type water heater. The N210 had replaced hot water created by an oil fired boiler, so refitting for a tank type water heater required re-plumbing again! I am getting pretty good with a torch and copper."
5,Outstanding state of the art product!!,"This is the biggest selling electric whole house tankless water heater brand in the nation. It provides endless hot water, saves up to 50 percent on your electric bill and is great for a moderate size home in almost any state. Imagine being able to fill your tub and the hot water not running out, or taking 5 showers in a row with the same hot water and saving so much on your electric bill over a tank model. The unit also provides healthier, cleaner water to bathe and use as tank models are being found now to breed bacteria and disease. Over 5000 good feedbacks for these units on Ebay. Don't listen to the first rater on here as he installed it wrong and seems very lost. GO TANKLESS and have endless hot water."
1,A dull trip down Memory Lane,"The story line is of two disk jockeys in the 1950's who decide to find the next teen singing sensation. This tired story line has a predictable ending: the vixen they discover ends up trashing her mentors, and they end up back in their original jobs. The characterization is flat, the jokes are stale, and the pace is dreary. Miss this one by all means."
1,The Bath Needs Draining,"This play was one of the most un-inspired and un-inspiring pieces of garbage I have ever had the misfortune of stumbling across. Its non-sensical nature, which is obviously geared to amuse its audience in spite of utter confusion, only leads to disillusionment and mental nausea. Durang is a talentless imp who needs to be banned from his pen."
1,Beware,Buyer beware. This is a case of false advertising. The picture does not match the shipped product. The coil is not sent. I have since learned that you need model 8548201c to have a coil included. What else is deceptive is that you can get the 8548201c model for approximately the same price elsewhere on the internet.
3,"a little off target, but worth reading","I enjoyed this book, and found it helpful in understanding Colonel Cary a bit better. It shed light on a very important character in Virginia's past that we otherwise wouldn't have. On the down side, some basic historical facts and dates were in error. The author also had something of a romantic view of southern history (that good ol' Colonial Revival mentality) and I found it sometimes got in the way of the historical relevence. Trust and enjoy, but verify."
3,"Perhaps OK as a ""star vehicle""","I have to be a contrarian about this film. As a ""star vehicle"" I suppose it's OK -- Garbo is in practically every scene & certainly displays all the qualities of a glamour queen. But the film itself is otherwise pathetic -- where to begin? Ham-fisted direction, uniformly awful supporting cast (who was their dialogue coach? They all speak in the same wooden, portentious tones), out-of-period make-up, poor camera angles, curiously truncated scenes (why is the fatal sword fight so short??). Surprisingly, I thought John Gilbert was not too bad, though he is clearly too old for the part & his eye-liner makes him look like a silent film actor who wandered onto the set by mistake -- but that's mostly because the rest of the supporting players are so bad."
5,Best Garbo film,"Camille comes close, but this is her best film. Wonderfully realized production in the gorgeous Mamoulian style. Unlike most films of the early 30s, it holds up very well today as a stately, yet quirky, piece of myth/history. The last shot is justifiably famous, one of the best in film history."
4,GARBO RULES!,"Greta Garbo is the reason to see this film. When she's on the screen you can't take your eyes off her. When she's not on screen you're wondering how long it will be until you see her again. Wow! They definitely don't make 'em like Garbo anymore! I could have done without John Gilbert who plays Garbo's Spanish lover. His bulging eyes get real old real fast. Some of the other ""bit part"" actors have a tendency to ham it up. Of course you don't believe for one second that Garbo could fool anyone by pretending to be a boy but that's a minor criticism. In conclusion, GARBO, GARBO, GARBO!"
1,No expiration date!,I couldn't find a production nor expiration dates on the product! How am I supposed to know if it's still usable? Specially that I found some small masses formed within the liquid inside the bottle.
1,Crazy !!!!,"Who in their right mind, would be stupid enough to pay $100.00 for this item ? No one. I suggest if you want to sell this book,lower the price.With prices like this no wonder the country is in a state of economical stress."
3,Sean Young and Kevin Costner make it smoke,"An intriguing story centered around a high-price call girl (Sean Young) that falls in love with a naval officer played by Kevin Costner. He knows she's hooking and soon learns she is seeing a high ranking government official (Gene Hackman) that Kevin Costner's intelligence duties center around. Albeit, the two men almost meet one evening, near her apartment, the same evening of her accidental deathSurprise follows surprise as the knot of disbelief tightens."
1,"The album ""Truth"" was a major disappointment","The only song I had heard from this album was ""If I could"" which I immediatly loved. So I gambled and bought the entire CD-- and it wasn't cheap. Besides ""If I Could"" there is not a single other song I like, and I doubt this will even grow on me. Buying the single is worth it-- not the enture CD. The lyrics are so bland and at least when the Backstreet Boys sing songs where the chorus is repeated over and over it sounds good. Joee has the great looks, but needs some work on his songs. He definitly has potential."
1,"Not freestyle, not dance??","I am totally disappointed with this album. Add Joee to the list of freestyle/dance artist who have distanced themselves from the genre. Truth is a departure from Joee's previous freestyle/dance album Just A Taste which I think was one of the greatist freestyle/dance albums of the 90's. Even with Joee's exceptionally soulful voice, I can't get a groove with this album. None of the tracks are even good dance songs. Since I thought in the beginning that this might not be an all freestyle album, I at least expected some good dance tunes. Angel is the only track that would sound decent in a club but it is backed up with that really tired and played out euro disco beat. Although I was disappointed with this album I hope it will be a success and turn the U.S. onto Joee helping to put him on the map as one dance musics greatist singers."
4,Joee full-length album,"This is Joee's 2nd full-length album. His first one was titled Intonation w/Joee ""just a taste"". This album ""truth"" was released June 1998 in Canada. He is a really good singer. The best song on this album is ""angel"" and also the last few songs which were included in his first album."
1,Disappointing,"The ring came in good time and the silver is shiny. However, there is no black in the lettering and the phrase on it can not be read. I wear it as a thumb ring and it made my thumb break out. I would return it expect the phrase on it, ""forget me not"", is important to me. I would love to give this ring an excellent review, but I just can not do that."
5,New to Winemaking? So am I.,"A friend over seas, living in a country where one must make their own, recommended this gem to me last year. Since then, although possessed of no previous knowledge or experience, I succeeded rather easily in making good wines. I also compared the wine from the recipes in Anderson book with highly recommended kits from Vino Del Vida. Although much easier and quicker, the kit product, while very satisfactory according to those who have tasted it, did not measure up to the superior wine made from Anderson's recipes.Practical suggestions for equipment, where to purchase it and techniques are explained in a straightforward fashion. With a relative small cash outlay and this book, you can be well on your way to an interesting hobby."
4,Great 'recipe book' for beginning winemakers,"Some books are meant to be read, and others are meant to be used. This one definitely falls into the second category. Spiral bound, this falls neatly open to whichever wine recipe you are currently working on. There are recipes for apricot wine, kiwi fruit wine, ruby port, sparkling wine, and everything in between.There are also photos and descriptions of winemaking equipment, explanations of how to fortify wine, troubleshooting techniques, and much more.True, not all ingredients are readily available everywhere. Many recipes require trial and error before they become perfect for your palate. That's the same for any recipe, though. Find out what raw materials you have available, open the book to the recipes which match your fruits, and have at it. You'll find that using this book as a springboard, you'll soon be amazing your friends and pleasing your palate with a product made right in your own basement."
2,For cold climates/fruit wines,"I was most disappointed with this book. It's written by CANADIANS and deals mostly with non-standard cold-climate grapes and FRUIT wines. If you are looking for a book on making wine from standard vinifera grapes grown at home in more normal climates, this book won't help. I found that the book ""From Vines to Wines"" by Jeff Cox is a much more helpful book."
1,I'd give it less than 1 star,"This was the worst book I've ever read. I had to read it in Seventh grade English and it was horrible. The characters are stupid, and so are the situations Kern finds himself in. I would NEVER read this book if you didn't have to."
5,Great Book but PRICE almost DOUBLE!!!,"This is a great book but luckily I found out that the NWF (National Wildlife Federation) that actually put out the book is STILL selling brand NEW copies on their website for $44.95 and at least any money they do make will go to a good cause, not into someone's pocket![...]"
1,Complete waste of money,"Complete waste of time and money. Trivial voice over discussion, nothing more than the mere basics of masturbation. 1990s gay porn actors demonstrating what we all knew about by the time we reached 18. I feel grossly ripped off."
1,Not worth the $,"Total waste of money! Sorry I went for this one. What is suppose to ""improve"" technique only tells you what most have known by the time they are 18. I didn't need some muscle jerk to demo how ""he"" does it. What happened to the ordinary man delivering the message?"
5,Rummikub,"We love it! Guests enjoy playing it as much as family members. eight more words. five more words. two more,"
3,Cheap Rummikub tiles,"I purchased this more expensive version of this game hoping it contained the thick, heavy tiles I had seen in another Rummikub game, but was disappointed to find that these tiles were basically the same as in the cheapest sets. I do like the carrying case, but I hope to find this game in a deluxe version with the thick, heavy tiles common in many of the domino games available at an inexpensive price."
3,disapointment,I thought that by buying the most expensive rummikub that I could find it would be the best but I was wrong. cheaber units bring a case and wooden holders. This set is way overpriced.
4,Family together time!!,This game has been played so much and my husband loves it. The larger tiles work best for his arthritic hands to manage keeping them on the tileholder. Thanks for continuing to make entertainment for boys and girls-whether they are 8 or 87 years old!!!!
5,Great Game and can be very challenging,"We love to play Rummikub and find it very challenging at times to see all the possible moves. We had to buy a timer to keep it moving since it can take alot of thought for some moves. We have had this set for 3 years and the painted numbers are starting to wear off since we play it so much. I do agree with the earlier review that the colors can be hard to tell apart. Lots of fun for adults and adolescents, and probably too difficult for many younger children without assistance."
3,Great Game - Bad version,"I've played Rummikub for 30 years and finally had to replace an old set. The colors used in this set are AWFUL. the red and orange colors are to close to the same and make game play difficult especially under tunsten light.Find a version with the original red, blue, yellow & black."
1,Worst version of the best game,"I love this game and play it all the time. However, NEVER buy the version with 'contour grip.' The other version has the numbers engraved and the paint is inside those indentations. The contour grip is a smooth slightly convex surface with the numbers painted on them. The numbers chip and wear away very quickly. Many of my pieces are now all but unreadable."
5,Marvelous,I've been playing this game for 20 years starting with my grandchildren and ven they are already grown up they like to play this game. It is a great game and everyone likes it. I recommened it to everyone.
3,Deluxe Rummikub,"The only negative to this product is that it has the feel of cheap plastic. I was spoiled by playing a friend's product which appeared (though I'm sure it was not) to be made of ivory - the pieces were heavier, had more of a solid feel. The slightly positive for this game is that there is a storing/carrying case which doubles for players' tile racks. The configuration works. But again, it has that ""cheap plastic"" feel/look. Oh well. However, the game is fun, so who cares what it feels like!!"
5,Great family game,"This is an almost addictive type of game. After you get the hang of it, you cannot let go.Highly recomend it for families."
4,Rummy,"This game is great. I have had this for years. If you like the card game Rummy, you will love this game. It's easier than holding up a bunch of cards...same rules and concept. It's great for kids and people with mobility disabilities. (limited hand movements or grasp) When I was younger I had a horrible time holding the cards, my stepfather bought this for me...I was able to play!"
4,router,Great router. No reason to wait until standard gets ratified. It always connects faster than my G router would. Setup a breeze and haven't had any problems.
1,Poor Quality Control,"I tried setting up the router, but was unsuccessful. The web interface didn't work with IE7, and web pages were being displayed garbled. I had to download Firefox to talk to it. The 1 gigabit output switch worked properly, as did DHCP. I set up the router for my cable modem, with static IP address and DNS servers. I couldn't connect to the Internet, even though the router thought I was connected. After a frustrating interaction with Linksys customer support, it was decided that the router was defective and I returned it. I also found from customer support that this model is not being supported under Vista."
1,Really bad if you have VoIP,"I purchased this product a year ago to upgrade to the Wireless-N draft spec and also get gigabit switching capabilities. This product sucks.I use it as part of a setup where I have Vonage. Thus, I need the router to manage call quality. I get choppy calls and frequently, the calls drop altogether.It appears that Linksys has stopped making this product and the most recent firmware updates were over a year ago. Many people on forums complain about this model and I would avoid it if I were you.Best thing I've done with it is dumb it down to act as a Wireless-N access point in my house."
1,Thank you...next!!!,"Don't waste your money. I paired this with a Linksys WUSB300N. It reported speeds from 240 to 300 MBPS. Great huh! Since my Linksys WRT55AB only reports speeds up to 54MBPS, the 330N should be much faster right? WRONG. In reality it had a greater lag time, much slower overall actual speed (transferring network files and internet use with a laptop, a desktop and an XBOX 360), and less range than the WRT55AB. Also, when paired with the XBOX 360, the WRT330N can not satisfy the network demands for streaming video, which the 55AB does fine. It does not matter whether the router is direct connected to the XBOX or the PC, it is still insufficient. I have the most current product version and the newest drivers. With 25 years of computer use, I know what I am doing, unfortunately with this router, Linksys does not."
3,3 stars only for potential...,"This potentially could be the best router on the market, especially for gamers. With that said it has too many bugs right now and mine is constantly down. It was released too soon by Linksys. If you are considering this router, stick it out with your old one untill they release the firmware that resolves the issues it is having."
1,Going Bonkers,Unfortunately the WRT330N wireless router is defective. It works for a short while then drops its signal...then it cycles from signal to no signal every 5 to 10 seconds. Worked with technical support on three sessions yesterday (6 hours)to try to fix it. Nothing worked. They say they will replace it through suppling store. I have it ready to return. Much inconvenience.
2,Everything seems fine except 1 major problem,"I saw the great reviews from amazon for this product and I just got it last weekend. Everything seems to work fine until 1 day later, the DSL seems to have drop out. Activity light in DSL modem is not flashing. So I reboot both router and DSL Modem. But then the next day I found the same thing happened again.So basically, it cannot be connected for more than 1 day. Except that, everything works great: it is much faster than my old G router (even with the same wireless card, interesting) Easy to set up, etc."
5,XBOX live OPEN NAT- Ultra fast Wireless N,"Wow... this is a great router. I had the WRT300N and it was good but for gaming it was horrible. When playing xbox live, it took forever to get players to play. I replaced it with the WRT330N and it fixed everything. Now I have OPEN NAT on XBOX 360, gaming on my comp is super fast and my labtop can pickup the signal from my backyard. Its very easy to install and haven't had any hiccups yet. The security is flawless and very easy to customize. With the OPEN NAT for XBOX and ultra fast wireless setup, you will not go wrong with this router. Wireless N is here."
2,Lan Ports Failed after a year,"I will never buy another Lynksys router. I have bought two over the last three years. The second was a 330N which I replaced the the first on for the same problem: LAN Ports Fail, but the wireless still works.Troubleshooted device byConnecting directly to Cable Modem = connected to INTERNET.Tried these procedures twice on separate Windows and Linux system confirmed failure.The bad thing I recommended this unreliable junk to others after I bought it.(my opinion Don't buy this junk)"
2,Doesn't work the way it says,I could not get this product to work with my cable modem (a problem I have not had with other routers). The Linksys help center is a complete joke. I would buy another brand.
4,Good short read.,This was a good short read. I found that it did have a dry moment or two but overall a good book.
3,I'll give as a gift,"These earrings were not what I expected. I'm going to have to learn not to purchase earrings online as I tend to love the pictures of them but not the jewelry when I get it. They are pretty but way too big for me. They are much too heavy and I would never find them comfortable. They are constructred fairly well although the back level that goes through the ear is a little too short. I have a friend that may like them, so I kept them and will send them to her. I also paid only $5 for them butd it cost me almost that much in postage. I certainly do not want to have to pay postage to send them back. If you are looking for a large, heavy earring then you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for smaller more petite earrings, do not purchase these."
2,Buy the better ones.,"These bolts have a 9/16"" 6-pt hex head, instead of the 12-point larger diameter typical to ARP brand and OEM styles. This makes the heads of the bolts too small for many flex-plate holes. When tightened directly into a tapped torque converter, the corners of the bolt head start to auger out the holes in the flex-plate and grind off the tips of the hex-head, for a loose fit. Certainly not the best choice for all 350/400 setups."
4,I give this movie a B-,"I know some people will disagree with my opinion that Raise The Bridge, Lower The River is not a terrible film. Yes, it's far from the best of Lewis's films, but I actually liked it overall. It's not a very funny movie, but it manages to be charming at times, and if you are a Lewis fan, as I am, you will probably enjoy it. I give it a B-"
1,One of Jerry's Worst,"Jerry Lewis traveled to England for this lame 1968 farce, which cannot be salvaged by the presence of Terry-Thomas. Some viewers may appreciate a restrained Jerry, but the results are deadly dull. Even the King of Crazy admitted he did this one solely for the money. Produced by Walter Shenson in a sad comedown from the glory days of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""The Mouse That Roared."""
4,Jerry Lewis movie on DVD,Gotta be a Jerry Lewis fan - and if so you'll enjoy this one alot! Pretty much Jerry being Jerry in classic Jerry style!
3,A Jerry Lewis movie that does have its moments.,"As a big fan of Jerry Lewis,this was not one of his best efforts. Sure there were some funny moments in DRTB,LTR especially at the opening and with Terry Thomas planning the schemes..but it just wasn't the Jerry I was accustomed to. I am kind of mixed on this movie. Wish the story line was a little bit better."
4,Great,Love these gloves. Not for long periods in very cold weather and not water proof. But otherwise I love 'em!
4,Some Things to Think About,"Duane's back . . . and he still has plenty to say (even under the guise of asking questions, he can't stop giving away the answers). There are plenty of new poems here, but the best thing about the book is that it features more of his signature series. Telling stories with these series has been and remains Duane Michals strong point."
4,Just a few pages and I was enthralled,"I started this book without any expectations, and I was more than pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a really engrossing story. I won't go into the storyline, but I really enjoyed the use of historical information in the novel. You get the time period when half of the book is set (1893) as well as a variety of anecdotes about the statuary and garden described throughout the book. It's well-written, although you have to restrain yourself from rushing since every other chapter is set in a different era (1893 or modern day) and can sometimes get confusing because of similarities between characters. Some aspects of the story are just a little predictable, but overall it's an excellent novel with a complex story about human nature and it's flaws, as well as some of the supernatural. I borrowed it this time, but I'll buy it for next time!"
3,"Worth reading, but not worthy of her talent","Goodman isn't as good as she could be, again. As always, she writes beatifully and creates a wonderful situation, but the resolution is sitcom-predictable and thus undermines the rest of the book. I wish that Goodman would develop the courage to let her ideas unfold: she pulls herself up short again and again."
1,Wasn't crazy about the characters.,This book started out ok. Then it spiraled out of control. The characters in her book were both too imaginitive and pompous and I couldn't stand the writing style. People don't talk like that. There are major flaws that could have been easily fixed with a good editor.
3,"If it work,s, don't fix it!","Themes that worked beautifully in the author's earlier books--a beautiful, spooky place, a somewhat unorthodox love, a curious but unsure protagonist--are exaggerated here. Instead of exploring irrational acts with rational explanations, we have a detour into the supernatural. When the characters started not only identifying with persons long dead but became possessed by them, she lost me. If this does not intererst you, don't abandon the author, however, all her other novels are first rate."
2,Ghastly,"I loved Carol Goodman's first books, particularly The Lake of Dead Languages and The Seduction of Water. I rushed out to buy this one in hardbound and i want my money back. She tries hard to get into new territory and meanders into ghost appearances, sculptures' spirits, and the like, and finds herself out of her depth. That plus the lack of development of her protagonist (and yes, a side character's bad poetry thrown in for good measure) reduced me to skipping pages and trying hard to keep awake. What a disappointment. I hope she goes back to what works or she will lose her readers."
3,Not Ms. Goodman's best,"I feel bad giving not giving Ms. Goodman a glowing review, I am a huge fan of hers, however this book is just not up to par. It reminds me of the gothic romances I grew up with, Victoria Holt, (the Grande Dame of gothic romance), Phyllis Whitney, Barbara Michaels....but about two thirds of the way through the book, something got lost. I can't explain it, I just found myslelf having to force myself to finish...I wanted to know what happened, or to find out if what I guessed was right, but the story just lost somthing...I wish I had waited for paper...but I will be front and center for the next offering from Ms. Goodman, she is normally to good to ignore."
5,A nice summer read,"I loved this book! It is replete with mythology and mystery. The author has a way of writing that draws you into her streaming flow of poetry. The parallels between the past characters and current characters wavers back and forth, flowing gently in and out of dream state. I couldn't wait to read it and hated when it was finished. Good stories like this are hard to find.There is one thing I would have liked,and that is a better description of the gardens which are the setting for the story, or a picture or map in the front of the book. I like to follow the characters as the story unfolds from place to place. I am always analysing whether this or that is possible and I don't feel that the author adequately described the logistics of the setting."
4,A fun and fast read,"I have read all of Ms. Goodman's novels so far, and she never disappoints. I enjoy reading a mix of nonfiction (particularly history) and novels, and I just finished reading a very intense, 750-page historical biography so I wanted something rather lighter and easy to enjoy. THE GHOST ORCHID totally fit the bill. I read it in less than a day, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Ms. Goodman's stories always have a compelling mystery, in this case a ghost story, with likable and relatable characters. She also weaves in interesting cultural themes, in this case Italian garden design and Native American mythology. (Trust me, though it sounds random, the combo works.) Plus, as someone who grew up in Upstate New York, I always appreciate her small town NY settings, too!"
4,Drowns out the kids!!!,"So you're a member of the class of '77 and now you've bought into the whole middle class. You're in the car with your kids griping about something in the back. Put this CD on and all is fine. The kids can't even understand what Mark Smith is saying, and you can just get in synch with his noise and misanthropy.The Fall may not have been among the top tier of their era's bands, but Smith deserves face for sticking it out and maintaining a singular vision without descent to self-parody or boredom. He may like repetition, as the lead-off track insists, but it doesn't preclude an interesting artistic vision that makes for a fine compilation.And it drowns out the kids. I love them, but sometimes it's gotta be done."
1,A VIOLATION OF ALL WE HOLD SACRED,"Why must Mark E. continue to torment us so? The only band to lay more ""music"" to vinyl than the Grateful Dead, and with no end in sight. No musician is more responsible for the ongoing violation of Mother Gaia and the mobilization of vast armies to secure resources to make more records: why do you think the UK is in Iraq? Enlightening us to The Monks is not enough! Any two-bit Mancunian ink-stained wretch could transmogrify rock n' roll long after Manchester United is forgotten. For Allah's sake, the dude doesn't play a guitar and is turning into a hunchback! When will the sonic rapture cease? And who decided to defile the memory of Nudie Cohen? Go ahead. Be a yob. Buy this and turn into some fey Brahmin who thinks Madonna isn't British. I'm warning YOU!!"
2,"I'm supposed to love it, but I just can't seem to grasp it.","Being a huge fan of the band Pavement, and hearing countless comparisons to The Fall, I decided it was time i picked up one of their albums. This was all I could find, and to be honest, it doesn't really strike me the same way Pavement does. I don't know what it is. I really want to love it, and I think Mark E. Smith has a truly unique stream of consciousness lyrical style, but there's just something about them i can't get into. The one song i do like, very much so, is the Classical, which is why I'm giving this 2 stars."
4,Very nice book.,This book was very good and it was about a girl named Sandy that had to move from her town and her friends and was sad about moving.Pam`s mother invites Sandy and her mother and their 2 ponies to stay at their house.But Sandy is sooooo sad that she runs away on her pony Raffle then the pony pals find her alone and they insisit on helping her.Find out if Sandy will stay in the woods alone or will the Pony Pals do something about it.
5,An exemplary study of London and US imperial malehood.,"A deeply historicized, wry, and often funny look at the process by which London fashioned a model of US masculine selfhood and expanded territories of (barely sublimated) territorial/regional conquest. One of the best books I know on a single-author study of a Pacific author from imperial era of national expansion, then or now [sic]."
2,"Not really worth the money, honey","I bought this DVD only because of Diana Sanda and the late Calvin Lockhart. The video is not of great quality, nor is the sound.I found myself falling to sleep, twice."
1,Honey Baby Honey Baby,This movie would have been okay if it tied all of the scenes together. Too many characters injected into the movie for no good reason.
3,ok,Qulity was not good but i like it bought it because Diane Sands was in it plus i like the name HONEY BABY LOL!!!!!
5,cheap shipping,I would like it if someone could email me the cheap shipping site for the pink lid toy chest. My email is Atkinsonms@aol.com
5,Shipping,I would like to know about the cheap shipping on this item as well. I can not believe that Amazon.com is charging $70 for shipping! Please email me at tjwoods8@hotmail.com.Thank you very much.
5,mudvayne ld50,"this is an awesome dvd if you like mudvayne. the best track on here are death blooms, internal primates forever, nothing to gein and cradle. The weak points are the bad video quality.. The guitar is 100%, the drums too and the bass is incredibleee !!! The singer (chud) doesn't have the same voice as on the cd (on the cd instruments are tuned E B F# B and on dvd F C G C), but it's still very good.if you like mudvayne live, they released.. today (october 14th) live bootleg cd from this summer summer sanitarium (august 6-7 and 10) with 'internal primates forever', '-1', 'cradle', 'world so cold', 'silenced' and 'dig'"
3,BAd sound quality?!?!?!,"WHen i first watched this dvd i was appalled by the poor sound quality and video quality. it really detracts from the band's performance. the other thing that shocked me was how bad the live vocals are. kud lets the whole thing down when he hits the wrong nots, leaves out words or sings at the wrong time. if you blend that with the flawless drumming, amazing bass and awesome guitar its just like putting ketchup on your sushi, they don't go together. If you are a real big mudvayne fan i would suggest you buy it, otherwise save the cash for thier next studio cd due out in november"
4,Pretty cool,"I love MuDvAyNe. I was fortunate enough to be able to see them this summer and their live show is even more entertaining than this DVD. It has all of the songs from LD.50 so it automatically rules. My one complaint is that the venue is small and there are too many lights, so you can't get clear looks at the band. The sound quality is a little sub par, but oh well. There is some funny footage of the band just being themselves in between songs (""do you have any tuna that's NOT dolphin safe?""). All in all, a good buy."
3,not the best,"I must admit, I am a true mudvayne fan but this DVD was not the best i have ever seen. I was a little disapointed about the quality of this DVD. do what you want, but i just dont think is the best."
2,The Selkie,"I thought I would give this book a try because it seemed like something different. I felt that the most romantic scene was the back cover trying to hook the reader in. This was another case where I didn't feel a major connection to the characters. I didn't feel the romance and that may be because the selkie was often stroking the back of her neck with his ""salts."" He seemed very controling. The author didn't seem to have a strong foundation to start the beginning of the book and it seemed weak all the way through.Read it once but I'm probably going to sell mine on ebay."
3,Selkie,Very much a historical romance-unrealistic perfect love dabbling in cross species erotica! I'm tired of the helpless stupid heroine in these things
2,Didn't Like it...,"I love fantasy/romance/adventure type novels and I was excited to find a book about the mythical creatures called Selkies, who are a race of beings who (when wearing there special skins) become seals. This book was slow. I felt like I was struggling through the whole novel to find something I liked. The characters all felt like dead weights to me. They were boring and I couldn't form any emotional connections to any of them. When I had about 75 pages left I ended up skimming to the end to see what happened to the characters. I don't know why, but this book just didn't do it for me. I couldn't get into it at all. I am a big fan of romance/fantasy type novels too so I thought this book would be great. I'm not sure what type of person this book will appeal to, but most of the other reviews are positive so it seems I am the odd one out here! :) Anyways, I wouldn't reccomend it, but if you want, go get a copy at your local library."
5,great product,This is a great item. My wife loved being able to see me in the dark. Made her squeel with delight. I would buy these again. We played all night long
2,Doesn't really glow in the dark.,"Wow, bought these for my friend because he gets it in a ton and I was worried he might get something or get someone pregnant. So i said what the hell i get him a cool little present. Well he didn't get them for almost a month and now he's telling me they don't even glow. Wow, I should have just got him strawberry ones."
2,3 or 12?,I dislike that in the product details it said this package would come with 12 condoms when it actually only came with 3. I notice the picture said 3 so I checked the details to be sure so I figured it would actually come with 12. This made me kind of mad. I'll just hope that they actually work and look good I guess.
3,...,"The description says there will be 12, but it is a pack of three. Be aware of this before you order."
2,Interesting...,"I received this product pretty fast after ordering it, but the damn thing broke the first time my girlfriend and I used them and now we don't really wanna risk them breaking should we really get in to it. They broke right at the start... but they do glow... a lot."
4,They GLOW!,"wow. it actually worked. very cool.Love the condom and what it does. I used a black light to get it to glow.only quarel with it, it needed more lubrication. albeit I had some from a recent condom purchase so it wasent too bad. I am not sure it I would purchase again, I really prefer the ""THYN"" Lifestyle condom brand.all in all, fun;glows; need more lube."
5,Great!!!!!,"I happened to catch most of the video in a Caribbean restaurant and I knew I had to own it. For all you Bob Marley fans, it is a must have. You get to understand what Bob was thinking when he was writing a particular song, or wher a particular song's inspiration came from. It's great!!!"
5,I loved this box!,I am 7 yrs old and I loved painting this box! The best part was that I could put all my little stuff in it when it dried and I could say I made it myself-Your kid will like it too-Nicole
5,Real-world tactics for Law Enforcement!,"This is an excellent basic training manual for law enforcement officers desiring to include the rifle in their tactical ""toolbox"". Concentating on the AR-15/M-16 system, Mr. Suarez gives a good basic overview of modern tactical rifle training and requirements. I am the firearms instructor for my department, and have found all of Mr. Suarez' books to be of great use in teaching my people. I am eagerly awaiting Mr. Suarez' upcoming book on the AK47 weapons system."
3,Nothing new here.,"Beginners/newbies might find more value here than I did. The book provides maintenance information. ""Tactical"" considerations are nothing new here, that you wouldn't get from Gabe's other excellent books. This was tactically redundant IMO ... I have great respect for Gabe and his materials, but if I was able to flip through this before I got it, I would not have bought it. I have this info from other books. Needless to say, it will stay in my library."
5,Best Book on AR15,"As a new owner of an AR15 rifle I was looking for a book that gave me the needed training necessary to be a responsible owner. I've purchased four books on the topic, this is by far the best. His easy to understand writing style and illustrated pictures are very clear. It's the next best thing to a hands-on course. Get this book first, you may not need anymore."
1,Simplistic,"This book is very simplistic. It covers basic topics and not in a logical order. In other words, this is not a how-to book. I was specifically looking to gain an understanding of neworking a home computers with a broadband Internet connection. This book could offer no help and had only one paragraph on routers (which wasn't very helpful). If you are just trying to understand what a home network is about then maybe this book will be helpful, but this will not help you set up a network."
2,Disorganized overview of home networking.,"Agree with a previous reviewer. Ms. Ivens' approach is disorganized and lacking in any cogent, ""how-to"" information. The book does provide a good overview of what home networks are, and why an individual may want a home network. But I was looking for a complete ""how-to"" book that would provide information on how to use what I already own. That is, I am a moderately proficient PC and Mac user. I already have a desktop PC (WinXP, wired) and Mac notebook (OS-X, wireless) which both utilize the same wireless router to access my broadband connection. I purchased this book because I wanted was a way to network the two devices to share files and a printer. This book did not provide that information."
3,Home Networking,My experience is that the book's title is somewhat misleading in that most of the content deals with network facets and WiFi issues not normally encountered by a typical homeowner. Hence I could make no use of it at all.
2,Home Networking for Dummies,"The title should be ""Home Networking for Dummies that still use Windoz!"" If you are looking for a book on the general subject of ""Home Networking"" this is not the one, look elsewhere."
4,chamber cantatas for sopr. or baritone,"These are chamber cantatas by Telemann for either soprano or baritone with instrumental accompaniment. They were written in 1725/26 and are known as ""Harmonius Divine Worship."" They were his 1st cantatas to be published - cantatas often weren't at the time and were often meant to be performed only once. Small forces used meant they were easy to perform at church, and Telemann himself said they were more for private use and home worship. The instruments are either solo violin,flute, or oboe with basso continuo accompaniment. The performers are all good (instruments are period instruments - soprano on Disc 1 - baritone on Disc 2(Klaus Mertens is especially good here). Four stars."
4,An enjoyable book about a cutting-edge industrry.,An enjoyable book. The action is set against the background of a high tech industry with plenty of insights into the workings of a telecommunications venture without being bogged down in technical details. It gives an exciting look at a start-up company taking on the corporate giants.
4,Good Story Line,"Liked the book very much. Story was interesting with a believable cast of players. The pace was fast, even and interesting. Even the technology was dished up in an easy to digest format. Good solid start building to a cliff hanger ending and well presented steamy scenes. Easy bedside reading with depth. Well done, Tom........... I hope to see more from you."
5,Good enough to be an action movie,I found this book so facinating that I had trouble putting it down. It has all the elements of a class A film story. Hope Tom writes more.
5,Love This Book,"This is an excellent cookbook. I love all of the recipes in this book. I especially love the fact that it's completely vegetarian, I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."
2,Not actually literature,"I expected a compilation of Anglo Saxon literature, but instead it is a history and a study of the said literature. If you are looking for stories I suggest Beowulf."
5,Helping others to pick up the pieces...,"When brokenness shatters the lives of people we love it is human nature to want to share the burden--but we often do not know how to help...""When His Secret Sin Breaks Your Heart"" is a wonderful way to compassionately and effectively help shoulder the difficult burdens your friend or loved one may be bearing...""and so fulfill the law of Christ"" to help carry someone else's crushing load! Pastor John C. Gore"
3,Letters to many,"Kathy Gallagher's story was really a remarkable one. I truly enjoyed reading through this book. It was interesting to read different accounts different women have gone through. I love how a lot of what her responses were had all pointed to following Christ and to live in according to God's will, even though it seems most of these women wanted to have everyone on their side for what was done against their marriage through their husband's sexual addictions. I think a lot of the times we want to point the finger at other people when really we have to also evaluate our own lives too."
1,was not helpful,The author was so whiny I wanted to cheat on her! It was mainly a bunch of letters she wrote on a lot of different situations. Just sayin
3,Letters to Hurting Wives,"I purchased this book because I was reaching out for all the help and support that I could get on my own to try to deal with the pain I have been feeling. I found this book to be less than helpful. I felt bashed and not understood or cared about while reading it. It did not validate my feelings and in fact gave me the feeling that I had no right to go through a ""mourning"" for what I though I had.I would recommend it to those who are well on the way to healing, but not to those who are looking for validation and support through the pain."
3,"Graphic noise, turn it off.","The reason I bought this book is to learn about Flash and XML. I did not buy it to read long winded passages, with cute word play. It takes way to long to get to the point.The book claims to be for designers but the graphics are ugly.Do we really need two basicly blank pages to introduce each chapter? What does the grey bar at the top of every page do? What are the 5 grey lines on each page for?491 pages long and 20 percent is wasted paper, get rid of the graphic noise and save a tree.Take a tip from the quick start books or the o'reilly books, make everything that is printed work for you. Edit out the fluff.The information is OK, but only when one takes the time to remove the graphic junk and word fluff."
3,"It was good, but the ending stinks","I like John Barnes, and I'm sure he had a reason for the ending he wrote, but I don't get it. But I'll be thinking about it for a while, so I guess that's worth something."
2,"A disappointing sequel to ""A Million Open Doors.""","This one has none of the charm of its predecessor, and the central conceit of the book -- that humans are populating the galaxy with designer cultures concocted by scholarly fanatics -- here seems much less believable. Our heroes, Giraut and Margaret, are assigned to an inhospitable planet to defuse a cultural war, but they mostly just kill time while events take place around them, and their marital problems make a dreary subplot, hinging as they do on a ""surprise"" that most readers will see coming a long way off."
4,Biscuits,"It was alittle comfusing with ordering the best price and using the free shipping. However the gift was received and appeciated, so all came out well. The dogs loved the biscuits and they rate it a 10!!! and thats what matters."
5,Plain biscuit is the favorite!,"I have an older dog who used to enthusiastically eat almost anything with no ill effects. Now she has grown very selective and many foods and treats cause her all kinds of digestive problems. This unassuming plain biscuit is her absolute favorite now. The only food she never turns down and has caused no ill effects. I didn't experience the size and price confusion other reviewers had. But there is another Nutro product with the same name that didn't sound as if it had the same ingredients. I hope they haven't reformulated! I am sad that this product is not currently available, but I am going to try the puppy version which does sound as if it is the same."
1,Loud and slow,This is a waste of money if you ask me. It blows loudly and takes forever to blow anything up
2,2 Stars for 2 Years,"Bought a few years ago; lasted 2 years with perhaps 1 use every 2 months.Save your money and shop around via Internet on a more reliable compressor: e.g, Camp.Haus., or others."
3,it's OK,Adequate for home garage use to top off your car's tires but built in guage accuracy is not good. I had to use a separate hand guage.
3,Value for price?,"Works fair, for the price you may be better off spending a little more and getting a better unit, if use is more that once or twice a year. Compact design and light weight is definite plus. The plastic connector is not very good, it over heats and blows the fuse if filling a car tire, noise level is very loud. The switch is not very user friendly - - bad location, cords are difficult to return to storage position."
2,It didn't last very long,"After a year of light use the unit would no longer work when connected to an outlet. It still works when connected to a car's lighter outlet. Trouble is I needed both. Some Black & Decker stuff is champion, like my battery mower and drills. Some of it is crap, like my power washer and this air station."
4,Good Air Inflator,"It can be operated either AC or DC power. I keep it in my trunk at all times. For the price, it's a no brainer."
4,Havent used yet,Arrived on time and no problems with ordering. This summer it will get uses as we do a lot of bike riding.
1,Overpriced replayment part,"I purchased this item late 2011. The plastic tip that connects the air hose to the tire snapped while I was trying to add air to my tire. This was during an extremely cold day in winter. I tried to replace the part, but BlackandDecker wants $8.00+ for the part, and $10.00+ to ship it by standard mail. $20.00 to replace a part the is cheaply made. If you live in a cold area, I would advise you the purchase another type of unit that has a brass connector."
4,Easy to Use,I bought this Air Station inflator when it was on the daily deal so the price was good. I liked that you could either plug it in to an electrical outlet or plug it into the cigarette lighter. I've used it both ways and really couldn't tell a difference in the airflow. What I really like is that you turn a red dial to the air pressure you want and and then turn on the machine. The inflator then stops when it gets to the pre-programmed pressure. I am usually doing other things when I'm using this so it's great that I don't have to go back and forth to be sure I turn it off before it over inflates. My only complaints are that it is a bit big and I had trouble getting the cords back into place when I was done.
1,Fuse is a major problem,"I had my Air Station for a little over 2 years...enough time for the warranty to run out. It worked fine, and I didn't use it very often until it just stopped. I suspect it's the fuse as I've heard from other reports over the internet. I called their repair center, and they said it's not repairable. I have an older inflator from another company, and I've used that for at least 10 years. My older one was built in the U.S. This more recent one from Black and Decker I think is from China. I obviously would not buy this again, and I would recommend you save your money for something of better quality."
1,Fancy Ball Pump,"I bought this so i wouldn't have to haul around my big compressor to pump up tires, unfortunately it isn't powerful enough to do tires, unless you have nothing but time to burn"
4,Every Garage Should Have One !,"I brought this inflator for $50. I just used it to fill up all my cars to 35lbs. It is a little loud, but it's fast and works really well. With gas prices being what they are I can't afford to not squeeze all the mpg I can get out of my vehicles.Plus you're really supposed to measure and fill your tires when they are cold and who the hell can do that if you don't have one of these. No more feeding quarters and running around like an idiot to fill my tires!Oh, if you do end up purchasing one of these when you set it up to the PSI you want you have to use the bottom edge of the measure bar (not the middle) because the inflator will turn off as soon as it touches it. Read this again when you buy it and it'll make sense.Highly recommended!"
4,Very Good Product,"I purchased this to keep my auto tires properly inflated. For me, it is more convenient and, over the long term cheaper, than going to the gas station repeatedly to inflate my tires. I have had it for over a year and a half and it does the job well. It takes a bit longer to inflate the tires than the gas station pumps, but I don't find that to be a big deal. Also, the built-in PSI guage is off by a few pounds so it is best to check the tire pressure with an accurate guage after filling up. But for that relatively minor flaw, I would have given this 5 stars."
1,Very noisy + takes fooooorever to pump anything,"Great packaging, but it fails at the critical aspect; ability to pump quickly.Bought a small baby pool and it took more than 6 hours to get it pumped. Not acceptable!"
2,Avoid - unless you only want the DC option,"Works great until you blow the fuse located on the circuit board. It can be replace, if you are handy with a soldering iron. Still works on DC, but that's not why I purchased it. I have to agree, Black and Decker quality is not what it once was."
1,Failed with little use,"I bought this in 2008, used it about 20 times (on 120VAC power) to fill bicycle tires - it worked fine and then in 2012 it failed. Read about multiple people having problems with the internal, non replaceable fuse blowing out. I dismantled the unit and checked - the internal fuse was blown, but that was because something else in the circuitry was blown out. Had to toss the unit. This unit spent most of its life indoors in its original box. This is not the reliability I'd expect from a Black and Decker product - especially from a product that might be needed in an roadside situation."
1,Works great....until it doesn't,"This worked great for about a year. Used it to top off tire presure on car tires, fill bike tires etc. Pulled it out last week to pump up a bike tire, switched it on and got nothing. Checked everything, then googled the problem and found that this is not only common, but that Black and Decker has made a product with a fuse that is not made to be replaced by the customer - it's soldered into a circuit board. Poor design, poor businss decision. Buy this only if you can afford to replace it yearly.See the link to their website for additional complaints: [...]"
1,Cute design - Worthless overall,"I purchased this with the hopes that it would be better than the one I purchased for $10 at my local auto part store. But it ended up being totally worthless since after two uses, the cheap plastic locking mechanism that locks in place on the valve steam for inflation broke and rendered the Black & Decker ASI300 totally useless.If you are considering buying a reliable tire inflation unit, don't waste your money buying this item. Make sure that what you buy has metal locking tip at the end of the hose otherwise, it will last you as long as it did to me."
1,Blown fuse - product useless,"After a handful of uses over a few months, the fuse blew. Huge headache to replace it. It doesn't make a lot of sense why B&D would have a fuse that you can't replace. Looking for a new unit now, definitely not going with B&D."
3,Gets the job done,"Overall works pretty well.Positives:- All hoses and wires and adaptors store inside the unit, for neatness.- built-in handle is nice- long 12V auto power cord- two-year warrantyNegatives:- When it stops automatically after inflating one item (such as a tire), it must be turned off and back on to inflate another item, or to increase pressure setting and continue filling.- the AC power cord is extremely short. Pretty much requires an extension cord.- the air hose is fairly short.- The noise it makes is quite loud, though not as loud as some I've heard.- fitting the cords and hose back into the storage compartment is not easy.- the valve adapter is plastic, not metal, and doesn't seem sturdy. It works so far, however."
3,Good Price But Far From Perfect,"First thing you should know, the Air Station Inflator is LOUD. Wear ear plugs if you care about your eardrums. Secondly, you must shut off the inflator and start it up again for every car tire. Third, the AC cord is a measly few inches. You will need to buy an extension cord. Finally, buy a digital car gauge to make sure you have an accurate measurement.I thought it would be a snap to fill my own tires but it's laborious, tedious, and loud. You might want to look at a more expensive, quieter model.Update 8-12-07: With its imperfections noted, I continue to use the Black and Decker and have gotten used to it. Sure, it's loud, but it beats going to the gas station and putting quarters into the air machine and scrambling to put air in your tires with your allotted 5 minutes. So for 50 bucks, the Black and Decker is worth it."
1,Broke when attempting to use for the first time,I got the product out of the box and tried to use it. When I went to lock the plastic piece on to my tire it broke in to 3 pieces.
2,Good while it lasted,"I got this back in October. It was good while it lasted. I could plug it into my lighter and the cord was long enough for me to reach to all the tires of my Honda Odyssey. It has attachments to use at home to inflate my children's toys. It's a compact machine I kept in my car for emergencies, and I seemed to have a lot of those.The dial worked as advertised, though it was difficult to see exactly where 37 PPI would be. When I got out my little tire gauge, it was always pretty close to what I wanted.This little machine broke last weekend when I tried to use it to pump 100 balloons. We were using both this compressor and my Intex Quickfill pump. The Quickfill was definitely faster, but the Air Station was doing its job. Then, it just stopped and it hasn't worked since."
2,"2 broke, each after 5 months.","bought one in february. used it about 4-5 times per week for bike tires. first unit failed in july. cost me money to mail it back to blackanddecker. received replacement in august, which broke in november. now will cost more to send that one back again. worked fine until it broke, but just not a product that can function in an everyday use type of situation. I need a more robust compressor with a tank."
5,Excellent value and works better than expected,"On ordering this product, i was skeptical that it could do all it promised, but on receiving and using it, it actually does all it promises, but is very intuitive to use."
1,"Junk! 3 failed units, all after only 2-5 uses","Great points: 1) Works on both 12V and household current. 2) Stops pumping at selected pressure.Bad points: 1) Stopped working after 2-5 uses for 3 of these inflators. 2) Black & Decker sends you a free replacement when it fails the first time, but requires you to mail the 2nd and subsequent failed units to their service center. After the third unit failed after 2 uses, it went straight to the trash. Don't waste your time with this piece of junk!!!"
1,Disappointed,"I just used my new B&D As1300 Air Station for the 1st time and was greatly disappointed. I had a older model that worked much better and faster and had longer power and inflation cords. When using the inflator, the storage compartment door must be left open which makes turning the air station on and off very awkward. The only part that broke on my old air station was the plastic valve stem attachment which I could not replace. If I had bought this new air station from a local retailer I would return it for a refund."
1,DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS!!,"SORRY BUT THIS IS A REAL PIECE OF CRAP! IT IS TOTALLY UNDERPOWERED, TAKING 20 MINUTES TO INFLATE A POOL TUBE. THE CORD IS 16"" LONG, WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO SIT ON THE FLOOR BY AN OUT LET TO INFLATE SOMETHING IF YOU DONT HAVE AN EXTENSION CORD. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Worthless,I never could get the gauge to calibrate to the correct reading. I found my tires were always overinflated or underinflated. I ended up junking it - waste of money.
4,Great for keeping you tire pressure up at home!,I hate to go to service stations and use their tire inflation devices. I love being able to maintain my tire pressure at home so easily.
1,Takes TOO long,The product is complete - but it appears to cheaply made - it takes a LONG TIME to add air to tires. I am going to return this unit and look for something else.
2,Black & Decker ASI300 Air Station Inflator,"It would be a good inflator, but for some strange reason the manufacturer limited the length of the electric cord to a foot and a half, not even long enough to leave it setting on the floor while I pump up bike tires. I have to get an extension cord every time I want to use this pump. I called Black and Decker to inquire about this design mistake but was not given an adequate explanation as to why the power cord is so short. I had a previous Black & Decker inflator that lasted twenty years and it worked and functioned very well.Many pumps priced at up to the cost of this Black & Decker ASI300, and now on the market work only by plugging them into cigarette lighters, in fact I have yet to find one that plugs in to A/C.I haven't been able to find any brand of pump that would function as well as my old Black and Decker or I would quickly return this ASI300 for a refund."
4,Black & Decker Air Station Infator,"I've only used this to blow up plastic items for the pool but it made super quick work of it and I was very happy with it. Compact unit could be stowed anywhere - boat, car, pool house, shed, basement. Only thing is it's a bit noisy. But it does a great job."
1,Loud and extremely slow,"Extremely loud when running, and extremely slow regardless of the item you are inflating. You have to literally cram the hose and wires into the storage compartment in order to get them inside, then you need to worry about pinching a line or cord when you close the cover. The hose attachments fit nice underneath but none of them fit air mattresses or the larger air holes. Also, the AC electrical cord is SO SHORT that it is almost impossible to use this product without an extension cord, which defeats the purpose of its compact design. Skip this item and spend a little more money on a better product. Sorry Black & Decker, you normally make good products but this one is lousy."
5,small but powerful,My son took his compressor when he moved to Colorado. The only thing I used it for was tires. This unit works great for my need. I like that you can set it and it shuts off when the pressure is achieved.
5,B & D Tire inflator,I have used the Black and Decker ASI300 several times and I am 100% pleased with it. I love the fact that I can use both AC as well as DC power. I also love the fact that you first set the amount of pressure you want it to go to and it shuts off autonatically . I'm allways adding air to my lawn tractor tires and this is so much more usful than my old inflator that used DC only. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It's the type of tool every household should have.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IE0YIQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
4,Black & Decker ASI300 Air Station Inflator review,It is good but just the nozzle is very tight and need to use force to push onto the tire
5,Top Gear,"The ASI300 does everything I expected of it. The auto turn off,along with the choice of plug in electric or car 12 volt power sources, makes this product worthy of consideration. And, most importantly, I have found the dial pressure guage to be accurate and the units power very sufficient. The unit is compact, easy to carry and stores all its wires."
1,Broke after less than 10 uses !!,Got a few problems with this product. The on/off/ac/dc button is not conviently placed. The dc plug and wire cover the button. Their is no handle. It's very slow. I filled my 4 tires from about 30psi to 45psi and it took over 30mins. Worst of all- It broke after less than 10 uses. It's too late to return it so I lost out. Buy something better. Dont waste ur money.
1,Don't Do it!,"I've owned two of these and it did not take long for the fuses to blow.A total waste of money. If you feel like throwing $50 away, buy it."
2,Inflator,The weight indicator did not work from the very beginning however it does serve its purpose.
2,Has strenghts and weaknesses,"I purchased this for school to be used as a multipurpose pump.The blurb stated that it had an inflation needle for balls and valves for inflating a variety of items.... it didn't come with any attachments and trying to contact amazon and the vendor has been a dead end.... so as far as customer support that has been a dead end.The power cord is only 1 ft long so I have to use an extension cord.The only real positive is being able to set the psi by rotating a dial.The hose is also short, we have a bike program at our school so that when I have to inflate bike tires I have to use two chairs, one for the pump and one for the bike so that I can put the wheel of the bike on a chair and the pump on a chair next to it.... its not an easy thing to do.The pressure gauge is on the only plus for this pump.Knowing what I know I would not recommend this pump for purchase it simply has too many issues and forget customer service."
2,Power supply issue..,"As others have mentioned, the fuse on the AC power supply is a problem. It is soldered in, and not replaceable by most people. Mine just went with a little less than a year of occasional use. I haven't replaced it yet so I don't know if there's a bigger problem than just the fuse. It does still work on the DC side. Because of this I can't recommend the unit."
5,effective little airpump,"This pump works with A/C or D/C power. It effectively and efficiently pumps up your tires or other to a preset pressure and then shuts off. It is easy to use and pumps up to the established pressure quickly. I used a tire gauge to verify the pressure and found it to be accurate. For the price, I thought I made an excellent buy."
1,Not worth it,"This thing isn't good. Just buy a real compressor. You have to set a dial to the pressure you want, plug it in, and it goes until that level is reached and cuts off. No way to just press a button and air comes out. I regret this purchase."
2,Great product with an Achilles' heel,"I liked everything about this unit until the internal fuse blew on it after 3 years of occasional use. As another reviewer states, you can replace it easily enough if you're willing to crack open the unit and solder in a new one on the circuit board, but if that doesn't sound attractive then consider yourself warned. A shame really; everything else about it is great."
2,good until it stops working.,This unit works as advertised initially but not when plugged into car power supply after 20 or so inflations. I used it to inflate a slow leaking tire on my vehicle and to inflate my son's toys occasionally. I would return the unit but it has been over a year since I purchased it and it still works if I plug it in to a wall socket. Very helpful tool if it were more durable and reliable. As it is I would not count on this tool or purchase again!
4,Good but not GREAT,"I bought the air station as a Lightning Deal, and for $30, it is definitely worth it. I have had a more heavy duty unit before, but it was of course more expensive. For $30-$40, I would definitely recommend this one. From inflating car or bike tires and rafts, to sports balls, this will get the job done. It does seem to take longer than I would expect to inflate, but by no means is this sold as some kind of professional grade item. It seems durable and can definitely get the normal tasks done. Use the pressure gauge as a rough indicator, and NOT as your final reading... get a real gauge. 4 out of 5 stars, and I would definitely recommend it to others."
4,Air Station,"This Black and Decker Air Station works well. You set the PSI that you want in your tires, ball or whatever, and it inflates to just that amount. Perfect for what we bought it for which was to inflate our bicycle tires. The only drawback is the length of the electrical cord which is VERY short. It also has a cord that you can plug into the lighter in your car which is much longer. All in all a good buy for the money."
4,Air station,Good ac/dc unit. My only complaint is the cord is too short. You must have a good extension cord to use it on ac.It has an ingenious switch to go from ac to dc. I would recommend this unit. I had a cordless previously which was handy but the battery had to be changed about once a year and they were pricey.It fills tires and swimming pools quickly.
4,Not Perfect But Does The Job,"I really like the Black and Decker Air Station Inflator. It is compact, and can be used with both a DC car battery or an AC wall outlet. However, the AC cord is pretty short, which means that you need an extension cord to use it. The air gauge usually works, but not always. You may need to reset it. I like that you can set the PSI and let it pump air until it hits that mark. Then it shuts off automatically.Since the AC cord is too short and the air gauge does not always work perfectly, I gave this 4 stars."
4,The Inflator worked fine for me.,"I found the Air Station Inflator easy to use right out of the box. I might have wished for a longer power cord, but that would have made the unit much bulkier. It does pump slowly, but still inflated my car tires much faster than the hand bicycle pump I'd been using!! The air pressure setting dial could have been marked better, as I had to estimate where the 28 pound cutoff was, but I was able to get very close to the pressures I wanted."
3,Pretty good but not perfect,"Small, lightweight, and easy to use. Does a good job on light applications like filling a ball or other small jobs. However, not as powerful as I thought it would be for filling tires. Does not seem to get above 40 PSI and struggles to get to 40. The recommended pressure for the rear tires on my wife's car is 44 PSI and this pump does not get there."
3,not sure,"only used it three times. after the first time the a/c plug quit working but our house plug ins arent in good shape. however, the dc plug works fine and the auto shutoff works great even in the cold weather of alaska. i do wish the storage compartment was bigger."
3,Flawed but functional,"I do like this item. had it for almost 2 years and then today the fuse blew inside the Airstation. Thank god for Amazon reviews as a previous reviewer stated that this can be serviced by yourself. ( I had lost the receipt) The fuse is soldered to the circuit board, so if you have no skills in electronics dont bother. previous viewer clipped the wires and glued the new fuse directly to the exposed wires. I ended up soldering the fuse on the exposed wires with 2 very short lenths of wire to make it easier, then I hot-glued the fuse in place. the fuse that is in there is tiny, and my replacement was a larger fuse of the same rating. that is why I soldered.otherwise, yes, it is loud, yes it takes a long time to pump car tires up if low, but it does its job and I use it alot. saves time running to the gas station."
4,Help for an old man!T,The Air Station Inflator is just what an old man needs to keep his automobile and bycicle tires inflated. The equipment is easy to use and is lighweight. A little bit noisy but that is not a problem since old men are hard of hearing anyway!
3,Case of the slows,"Well designed, reasonable price, and has all the features one would want (AC or DC operation, auto shut off), but, at least for auto tires, it does not get the inflating done fast enough, in my opinion. Good thing it has the auto shut off because you will want to be able to leave it to do other things while waiting. I had to re-inflate a tire that was 10 lbs.low - it took several minutes. Perhaps that is all one can expect from these small, portable inflators."
4,Really Good,"I bought this to keep the tires on my car inflated (old tires), and it works really well. The feature that lets you dial in the desired pressure works fine. Only small shortcoming, is it's a little hard to lock the nozzle end of the inflation hose onto the stem of the tire. I would recommend this though."
4,Good inflator for those who like to DIY,"Affordable, easy to use product for pumping my own car's tires. The trick is to inflate to a pressure level a few PSI higher than you desire. Then let out air to reach the correct pressure with a tire pressure gauge."
5,Great to have around the house and while traveling,"This sure beats running to the gas station and fiddling with their equipment that hardly ever works. I've had my Black & Decker for a few months now and love it. It is light, compact, and easy to use.Some negatives - loud, hard to read the exact tire pressure on the gauge, and it is a bit slow.However, for the price this is a great product to have around the house and to take on a trip. I'm very happy with it, it is a solid, good performer."
