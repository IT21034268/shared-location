3,Star Wars : Revenge Of The Sith ( GBA ),"Star Wars Episode III - The Revenge Of The Sith on the Gameboy Advance was slightly better than I had expected. It is a side scrolling game with both single player and multi-player fun. You take control of the two Jedi Knights Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker as you play through thirteen action packed levels with each. Both characters have different skills and different story mode levels as the game progresses too. As for the graphics, they are some of the best I have seen on the Gameboy. The game looks smooth and everything seems to fit together well. There is not much else to say about this simple and easy to pick up and play game. I hope that if you do purchase it you enjoy it atleast half as much as I did."
3,It Was OK.........,"The game is all based as sort of a walk through a hallway. You go down this tunnle battling enemies and when you get tho the end you battle a boss, and all you have to do is perry and he loses real easyI liked it that you could custimize your caracter, but the mapping Just bade it a bad game! If you want a good RPG, get retuth of the king of metroid prime."
4,Fun!,"This is a fun game! And I like how you can be the characters from the movie, and battle where they did! The only bad thing is that they didn't use the real voices for the characters."
3,Pleasant vacation reading,"This book is a pleasant read with a predictable and uninspired plot - 30-something executive wife gets dumped by corporate ladder-climbing husband and embarks on a journey of self-discovery to find a new man and happiness at the end. While the main character is reasonably well-developed through the use of flashbacks to her baking experiences in France and wonderful descriptions of bread-making, the other characters are somewhat flat and one-dimentional. Having said all that, however, the author's style is engaging and the book held my interest to the end. This is a perfect book to read at the beach or on a plane ride to your vacation destination."
1,BOORING,"Typical story of the woman who gets dumped by her husband for a more exciting woman. This one bakes bread to ""heal"" and meets another guy and Yupee every thing is super again..."
1,Hard to feel sorry for this shallow character,I read the reviews and the premise of the book and eagerly settled in for what I anticipated would be a pleasant read. I hoped that the shallow whiner at the beginning of the book would evolve into someone a little wiser and more sympathetic by the end. Alas. This character irritated the heck outta me - and her rude comment to a friend about an overweight woman in a market was as offensive to me as a racial slur. No thanks.
4,Self-Discovery and More,"When Wynter's smarmy husband unexpectedly suggests that they separate, she is floored. She has little job experience and has drifted in an unfulfilling marriage and life in LA for years. Wyn soon finds solace in baking bread, despite her crusty co-worker, Linda. Relocating to Seattle, she establishes a place for herself in a small bakery and starts a new life. She moves from a desire to get revenge to a search for fulfillment.Hendricks has taken a modern-day romance and populated it with some really memorable and well-developed characters. The story and the characters ring true and the novel moves along quickly as we follow Wyn on her journey of self-discovery.All kinds of relationships are explored in this book and the author looks at them with honesty and humor. While a bit predictable, it is never pedestrian. And the bread-baking tips were a welcome extra."
5,A surprisingly good first novel.,"I was hesitant to purchase this book because I didn't know the author's work and saw it was her first novel. I'm very glad that I did buy it. It is a great book. Hendricks has invented a new style with recipes, lots of humor and spot-on dialogue and family complications. She reminds me of Ruth Reichel but in my view, even better. She also reminds me of JoAnn Mapson and that's very good company to be in. An excellent story."
3,"Like good bread, this book needed a little more proofing...","Bread is the perfect metaphor for love. It requires patience to allow it to develop slowly and bring out its true flavor and richness. I wish that Judith Hendricks would have allowed her prose to develop a little longer and bring out a better flavor for her novel. It is the story of a woman recovering from the grief of a bad marriage and how her life is redeemed through baking, time spent with her best friend, and a man she meets at the neighborhood bar. My other complaint is about the title, and although Hendricks acknowledges Daniel Leader (who wrote a book with the same title - a book, by the way, that is the absolute best bread book on the market.)I do wish she would have come up with a different title for her work. If you are going through the end of a relationship, this quick light read, just like a simple loaf of bread, will nourish and sustain you for another day."
3,Pleasant-ish read,"I didn't want to like this book at all after the first 20 pages or so. The upper class ""problems"" really got to me. When she moved to Seattle, I began to like it much better (my Northwest bias perhaps). The writing is quite good, but some of the scenes are a bit unbelievable and/or predictable and some characters are just too much (Linda the baker and the stepbrother - please).She did a fabulous job of making me want to eat good bread! The recipes-in-novels formula is getting a bit overdone though.Not great literature, but a nice rainy day read."
5,Lovely Book,"Make a cup of tea, curl up in a comfy chair then open ""Bread Alone"". You will want to read all day. At the moment I'm baking scones, a recipe taken from the book, and they smell heavenly. If you like Seattle, bread, music, romance and discovering what really makes a person happy...then you will like this book.Susan"
5,Excellent!,This is one of the best books I've ever read. I loved Ms. Hendricks' sense of humor. Several of my friends read the book at my suggestion and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was so impressed with this book that I e-mailed the author directly to tell her so. She took the time to e-mail me back and thanked me for my comments. I am looking forward to her next book.
2,There are better books out there.,"This book started out great and then halted quickly. The husband having an affair leaving wife theme is done again and again and I do enjoy reading about the down and out women making a fighting comeback. However, in this book the story was very slow and the characters not very engaging.There are many other books out there--the first wives clubs, revenge of the middle age housewife are just two examples of better written stories with the same theme."
3,Knead a light read?,"This book ""rises"" enough to keep the reader interested; its characters ""yeasty & proofed."" But, since I'm a ""gluten"" for multi-layered stories, ""Bread Alone"" left me a bit disappointed. However, it is a decent book for ""loafing"" around."
5,This book is a great woman's book,"It is a book of many situations. It is a book that I didn't want to put down. It had situations that many women today are facing, the problems that can arise in marriage, childhood, and finally the solution one woman chose.This writer keeps you wanting to turn more pages. I won't reveal any of the characters or the plot, but I would like to re-read it, it is that kind of a book."
4,Satisfies like warm bread,"This book will make you hungry - for a good, crusty bread fresh from the oven as well as a second chance to do the thing you love most but have abandoned in favor of more ""traditional"" pursuits.Hendricks gives the reader a pleasant, warm glimpse into the life of a young woman who is able to reinvent herself by rediscovering what she truly loves - bread and herself. Although a failed marriage and romance are central to the plot, the protagonist is able to do forge an identity on her own - apart from a man.A quick read, but an enjoyable one worth the time."
3,Who was the killer?,I liked Bread Alone and all of the recipes but did I miss something? When there were 2 women killed nothing else was said about it. I read on and on thinking he would appear again or find out who it was. Never happened. Maybe the answer is in The Bakers Apprentice the follow up book on Bread Alone. We will see.
3,REVERSIBLE,"but I really only like to wear the lighter side out. I would still recommend this to anyone interested in a vest, that is not bulky and that will provide a moderate amount of warmth."
3,VEST - by Turfer,"It's okay, a bit baggy, but otherwise acceptable.Material and finish is ok.The fact that it is reversible, makes it versatile."
3,It's OK,"It's OK not great but usable, what do you want for the price. I need to add some more words to this review"
4,Turfer reversable vest,"Absolutely wonderfull and not heavy, wore it outdoors w/ a coat in below 0 weather, kept my trunk warm. Indoors it works well and when weather warms up i'll add more info. Note: as stated by others, it does come larger than ""normal"" but vests should not feel tight. You can always take it in if needed. First wash it warm and dry it low to get rid of fleece sheds: no shedding after I heeded someone suggesting this.Xcellent value, materials & finish, gonna be able to use it year round and play golf with it which was one of my reasons to buy it.Very happy, now my preferred vest of 3 I own."
1,The photos are too small to be useful,"There are range maps on every page. That's the only good thing about this book.The photos are too small to be useful. Each of them is about one inch in width and height. Also, the color looks washed out.After reading it in the local library, I decided not to buy a copy of it."
2,so-so,"Wouldn't buy this DVD again... It's definitely a good yoga DVD but in my opinion it's just for beginners. The best part is that the instructors talk you through everything so well that it actually allows you to focus on your movement and not break your neck looking at the TV in order to follow the master yogi.I got this DVD mainly to bring variety into my ab workout routine, but have to say that I was disappointed... However, one of my friends, who works out every blue moon, found some exercises rather challenging.So if you are a beginner - go for this DVD because it's very explanatory and the exercises won't kill you!"
1,disappointing,the core workout was ten minutes if that. i expected more. i guess being a beginner i did not like the 35 minute yoga program too fast for me. will return if i can.
2,Disappointing,"I hate to give something YogaWorks related only two stars, but I found the workouts on this DVD disappointing, and I wouldn't recommend this DVD.There are two workouts on the DVD: a 9 minute Fit Abs workout and a 43-minute Core Yoga Flow workout.The Fit Abs workout doesn't really have any yoga-specific elements and doesn't utilize any of the traditional core-specific asanas (e.g. navasana). It's a series of crunches and plank exercises that you would do in any gym class.The Core Yoga Flow workout is very slow. This longer workout does have more traditional sequences and asanas, but it's not exactly a flow workout where you move through one pose for each breath throughout the workout.I was hoping that with this DVD I could incorporate some of the YogaWorks energy and focus on flow into my home practice. Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't deliver."
2,cozy crochet,"I've been crocheting for two years now, and at the very least, I don't need to keep looking up how to make a single or double crochet stitch anymore! That being said, I think this book (so far) has both really, really simple projects like the dishcloths and coasters AND overly confusing and somewhat misleading projects like the cozy kerchief. The lovely picture of the kerchief is not triangular like the pattern indicates. Unfortunately this specific picture is one of the main reasons I bought the book, and it simply is not what this book tells me how to make. Wouldn't it be cool if the author or publisher or editor put up the real pattern online somewhere?"
4,made a crocheter out of a veteran knitter!,"i have been trying to grasp the concept of crochet for decades... my mother is a crocheter, my aunt is a crocheter, but for years i have tried and failed MISERABLY. on my last vacation, i picked up this book and was able to do the first 4 projects without problem.maybe not for beginners as the other review states, but definitely worth a try for more seasoned crocheters or knitters that would like to learn."
5,Great Crochet Book,I love all the great projects in this book and the shipping was super fast. The book arrived in perfect condition.Thanks for the great service and great book.
2,too simple,"I would consider myself a beginner to intermediate crocheter so I took the advise of someone to get this book. I was disappointed to see how simplistic this book is. It is a pretty book on the outside, but it really should be labeled in some way that it is for the very beginning beginners."
2,Fast food pilates,"This DVD relates to Pilates the same way as fast food relates to real food. The emphasis is on speed not quality . The exercises switch quickly from one to the next with minimal instruction and , worst of all, with a minimal warmup. Some things just take a little time , and I believe pilates is one of them. Pilates is like good sex, it shouldn't be rushed. If you can't spare more than 5 minutes for a pilates workout you have a problem that pilates isn't going to solve. I would reccommend the Lindsay Jackson ""Pilates for Men"" DVD. Sure, the workout takes about an hour but it has a good 15 minute warmup, good instructions and seems well balanced and structured."
5,double shot of the Funk,talk about a versatile compilation here? a Taste of Honey had two of the Baddest chicks who could play and are crazy Fione to the eyeballs as well. had much jams fast and slow. they stayed funky and in the pocket.then on down you got the Brass constructin who had the kind of horn section that would throw your hips out of wack. tight strong arrangements and grooves that could not lose. and what makes this two for one on the One is that you get a versatile but still tight funky package all for one. jams all over.
4,Good,Old school good to hear. The five song for Taste of are thier best. Brass Construction had two good one on this CD. Five more song Brass that in place of three of the song on this CD.
1,Try the Nissan Food Jar instead...,"I have a Nissan 16 oz. wide mouth food jar (the one with the little orange dot on the front of the lid) and it works great in keeping soup hot for 5-6 hours. Bought this Thermos food jar at Target and was very disappointed. It claims 4-5 hours, but after just 2 hours, the food was lukewarm. I also find the Nissan jar to be more ""sleek"" without the bulky plastic lid. Plus the screw threads on the Nissan are also stainless vs. this one has plastic threads. I'm takin' it back...."
1,This sucks!!!,"I've had this container for a while, and I thought it was keeping the food hot, but then I noticed that my kids were bringing their lunch back home. I tested it myself, and had the same result indicated in another review; the hot food was barely warm after just 2 hours. Don't waste your money."
2,doesn't keep the heat,"This product didn't even keep liquid hot for 2 hours. I preheated the thermos with boiling water and let sit for 10 minutes before putting soup in. Two hours later, lukewarm, and not a safe temp to keep food. It's going back."
2,Disappointed,"Was disappointed in this product. Bought them for my daughters' lunches. Didn't even last a semester. The thermos did not tolerate hot food and came apart at the top ""seam""."
2,Worked okay for a year,"I got this for my daughter to take to school for warm school lunches. I realized quickly that the rubber gaskets needed to get thoroughly cleaned every time (all it took was confusion as to why it wouldn't stop smelling like minestrone soup). After about a year of regular use (probably 3 to 5 times a week) it started smelling moldy. I tried cleaning it out with baking soda, denture tablets, and even bleach, but nothing got the smell out, so into the trash it went!"
1,the worst,"I don't know how they can call this a ""thermos""--it did not keep my food warm for even three hours! Absolutely the worst food jar out there."
2,Did not work for me,"I like the solid feel, weight and looks of it. When you plug in for power, you get a sense of pureness. I turned on my mixer, the noise was still there, static and radio tunes. I'ts like my house is possessed by the spirit of static and radios. $100 experiment that failed. I'll keep it though, on the bright side nothing beats plugging into something that looks and feels of quality."
4,Islam and Politics - One in the Same?,"Islam and Politics - One in the Same?Bernard Lewis's book ""The political language of Islam"" is rooted in Islamic scriptures and classics and shaped by Islamic political experiences. It uses metaphors and symbols that sometimes coincide with and sometimes differ from those of the Western world, and it operates within a frame of reference and allusion often unlike that of the West. The author traces the growth and development of Islamic political language from the Prophet and the promulgation of the Quran in the seventh century through the transformation of political thought, institutions, and discourse in modern times."
3,Star Power,"This CD was referred to me by a friend who talked highly of the band. I wasn't super impressed by the music or the message. It sounded like something that had been done before, but I couldn't really put my finger on it. Pretty good music overall for a local band, so I can't complain."
5,SugarBuzz-Can't stop T-Bone and Crew,"I have been a loyal fan of Sugarbuzz ever since I saw them in concert for the first time a while back. Since then I have been to quite a few of their concerts, lucky as I am to live in an area they frequent. The CD is great, but the live show is amazing. These guys get better every time I see them."
3,I should have known,"I bought these speakers to use with my Creative MP3 player. They were very reasonably priced and they are attractive. The sound quality is fair. But then, the speakers are not that expensive.I kept them, but would not buy them again. I would rather pay more (even much more) for better quality sound. Ok to use in a pinch."
4,Belkin Mini stereo dubbing cable,"This product is of good quality. The cable is supple and coils easily. The performance is as expected for this inexpensive product. Although the overall diameter of the cable is larger than anticipated taking up more storage room, it is adequate for my purposes."
1,Doesn't work with iPhone + case,"This cable is advertised as compatible with iPods and iPhones, and technically it is... but the design of the plug is such that it is too thick for use with any device enclosed in a case. I have an iFrogz case on my iPhone, which is not a particularly thick design, and the plug doesn't fit. I have the TomTom iPhone car kit, and again the plug doesn't fit, even without the case -- which is disappointing, because I purchased this shielded, 6' long cable exclusively to connect my iPhone to the audio input in my car while using the TomTom kit. Since most folks that I know who have iPhones also use a case, this cable is probably not a good choice."
4,Very useful book,"As someone new to Logic I have found this book to be extremely valuable in learning many of the esoteric features of logic. I've used Cubase extensively and Logic is a bit of a paradigm shift, but this book is now helping me with this. The book is quite meaty in places which suits me fine considering I've been writing music on computers for years now. I didn't buy the wizoo guide because it looked pretty basic and my needs were more advanced. Only little niggles I've had is a few typo's and bad spelling in the book. Otherwise well worth it... Pity about the exchange rate to New Zealand dollars though."
3,Develops strange marks,"This is a hard size of pan to find in metal. I was thrilled to find it, but after 2 months, it has developed discolored marks several places inside. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm continuing to use the pan. It's sturdy otherwise."
3,"Technically Solid, but Musically Unsatisfying","I was looking forward to this CD given the favorable press surrounding this rising star. After a thorough listening, I would emphasize the word rising. The notes are played more or less accurately and he has some wonderful colors in some of the Scriabin etudes, but overall these recordings lack the passion and fire necessary to make Rachmaninoff and Scriabin come alive. Horowitz and Richter offer far more compelling interpretations of these works. While good, Lang Lang has further to go before he's in their league."
5,a journey to heaven,this is a glorious piano concerto and I so enjoyed the subtle differences that Lang Lang brought to it.His interpretation is a joy.
3,Not the best,"I had the chance to see this young pianist in Vancouver in the Fall of 2003. I came out with new respect for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, but found Lang's performance too over the top. He tried to dazzle me with his ability, and while I am sure that he is brilliant, he didn't convey the music as much as he displayed his talent.While the movie 'Shine' obviously brought me into contact with the Rach 3 as it is now called, I still hold an affinity to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with Rafael Orozco version of this piece. However, the best is still the Horowitz and Ormandy version of this. If you want to hear the correct use of talent listen to the latter.Lang is a young one, and like a young wine, needs to be kept in the basement for a while until it matures."
1,TERRIBLE sound quality,"I love Lang Lang and bought this CD specifically for that reason -- but I was very disappointed at the sound quality. Usually Telarc has great recordings, but this one was the worst I have ever heard. I was not able to finish listening to it.What an awful way to showcase a major young talent."
1,Oh dear,"Unfortunately, the technical engineering of the live recording in Albert Hall is of such poor quality that it compares with recordings of 30-40 years ago. Despite Mr. Lang's artistry and that of Temirkanov and the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, I am gravely disappointed by this purchase. By comparison with the Carnegie Hall concert and Deutsche Gramaphon's technical expertise, this really rates no stars at all."
1,Blithe and trite,"Unfortunately, this work, like much of what is produced by Legionaries of Christ, is lightweight and uninspiring. The work skims the surface of any type of truly Catholic thought, which has traditionally been profound and thought-provoking. This type of good-feeling musing is an insult to true Catholic Orthodoxy."
4,Why Not An Oscar !!!!,"Vera Drake is a beautifully acted English Film by Director Mike Leigh, whose depiction of wartime England is perfect. It takes us through the adult life of Vera, who helps terminate unwanted pregnancies, whilst keeping her loved ones in the dark. Imelda Staunton's role as Vera hits the mark and is truely deserving of the oscar that evaded her (it eventually went to Hilary Swank..The academy played it safe, as they always do). The supporting cast do a fine job also...Not exactly a tear-jerker but nevertheless still gives a gentle tug to the heart-strings."
1,this movie aborted 2 hours of my life!,"First let me start on a positive note: acting is superb.Story? Not much of a story. I could not believe review on the back of DVD--something about dramatic twist at the end. Give me a brake! Half of a movie shows us how her life is really so average, just going around, doing her chores, work and family--boooring! Here and there it shows how she ""help"" women who are pregnant to abort. At the end she gets arrested and goes to jail. That's a whole story. No dramatic twist, no character development, no historical backdrop that would tell us something about views of the time--this one is a big miss, because movie might have been more interesting if introduced views of politicians, church, judges, average women. If you have 2 hours to spare, you might put your feet up and stare at the blank wall-time better spent."
2,A great film for your grandma,"I had high expectations for this movie and it really fell short. It starts out with dialogue I cant hear or understand. Everything I did hear was unimportant to the plot and boring.First abortion, wow thats interesting. 4th abortion, yawn. Have a cup of tea, another abortion, ohh no the cops.There wasnt really any conflict until the end of the movie when the cops show up at Vera's doorstep. It goes from smiles to tears, and more and more tears. Vera crys and mumbles. The end.Nothing really happens in this movie.I thought it was ok when I finished watching it. I tried to come up with some good points to defend it. I wanted to jump on the band wagon with everyone else so I could have another great film to share with people. It sucks...but maybe grandma will like it because there are no curse words or rap music in it."
1,Slick Pro-Abortion Propaganda,"Slick pro-abortion propaganda vehicle using saintly grandmas. After all, you can't not like a grandma, right? Well, besides the fact that the movie is slow, altogether very very slow and tedious, it is outright propaganda indeed, yes it is; and it leaves me wondering: when is this filmmaker and screenplay writer going to be making a movie about saintly grandma Holocaust nurses? Yes, of course! Let's make a movie about some nurse who helped Dr. Mengele carry out his macabre experiments! Wonderful! Doesn't it make you feel good? About as good as this movie does? Ancient peoples sacrificed their children to the fires of Moloch and Chacmool, et al; we of today sacrifice our children to the twin gods Convenience and Irresponsibility. And yet we have lost our barbarism?--humankind is just as savage as it ever was."
3,Drags on but is still good,"Vera Drake starts off really slow, half of the first have could be cut and we wouldnt miss anything. Half way through the movie speeds up and the emotions are released. In the end, Vera Drake is a movie that'll make you think. It represents both sides of the abortion debate pretty well, and doesnt really take sides. Excellent acting is the real plus of the movie."
4,True life confessions,"WOW, I've said it before and I'll say it again, British films seem to do more with less. I'd never heard of Imelda Staunton before this movie, but her performance, especially the interrogation scenes, was so on target it earned her an Oscar nomination. (You may remember her as the disgruntled school principal in Freedom Writers). Substantial performances all around, Vera Drake is a masterpiece from start to finish. I gave this film four instead of five stars because, as with most British films, this movie simmers a tad too long. But just a tad!"
5,what a great movie!,"Imelda Staunton is a stunning actress! I cannot imagine that somebody can have so much emotions.Even though Vera Drake, to my knowledge, is a fiction, I am glad that it touches your heart as if it is a true-story. Maybe this movie will help those who want to take us back to stone ages think twice before they act on their ""moral"" dilemmas!"
2,to abort or not to abort that is the question,"Vera Drake a slow moving drama of a woman and her post WWII family in the 50's. It is a movie that I wanted to physically push along to pick up the pathos. The film plot its self was interesting. I had problems with the thick cockney drawl and the slow moving story line. I did enjoy the acting and the glimpse into a simpler time of human emotion and understanding. A glimpse of the more things change, the more they stay the same. The police showed compassion for there prisoner. Vera Drake was honest and forth coming as played as a loving villain. The audience was able to get to know each of the main characters and have a genuine feeling for them as the story climaxed."
2,a new way to get info out of P.O.W.s,"It's difficult for me to go into specifics with regard to what I found so horrible about this film because my mind apparently went into some type of state-of-shock-survival mode, I guess like what happens during any sort of severe abuse, and all that register in my memory was the fact that it was entirely unpleasant. If you are into really slow, overly dramatic, storylines that have been ran into the ground,or feminist-hero-over-body-rights issue (etc) movies about people uplifted for being humble and simple, well, you'll have a good time, or consider scheduling a visit to your dentist."
5,Running great,I am running two of the board to run 32 security camera system on each board with out problems ... Have another board on hand... Filled the RAM up and have 3.80 processor .. Used a 850W power supply. Run them day and night for 6 months now with out over heating...
1,DOA,I received the motherboard and it turned out to be DOA. I have contacted the seller and am going to try and return it.
3,Wireless security: misleading title ?,"When I purchased this book, I thought that it would contain some information on wireless security such as GSM, CDMA, etc. but this book only talks about another sense of wireless which is applicable to other appliances. The contents of the book give a good introductory material which might be needed before a customer decides how to secure their valueable things."
4,An enjoyable mix of action and adventure!,".....with a pinch of romance. In this sequel to The Innocent, Anne, fleeing from her dangerous love affair with the King, tries to establish herself as a merchant in a new country. The male merchant's don't take kindly to this upstart of a women presuming to do business as their equal. But Anne has other more deadly enemies to worry about...and a new even more precious secret to keep safe.I enjoyed this sequel. Anne de Bohn is a character I don't get tired of reading about. It's got lots more suspense, adventure, and sub-plots than the first book. I'm glad there's a third book as there is unfinished business left here."
4,Wonderful historical fiction.,"Full of passion, twists, and drama...this will keep you excited and on your toes. Also, a little pricey. Still good!"
4,THE EXCILED,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK, IT IS 0NE OF A TRILOGY BY POSIE GRAEME-EVANS.IF YOU ARE A HISTORICAL FICTION FAN OR LIKE JEAN PLAIDY I'M SURE YOU WILLENJOY IT TOO. THIS TRILOGY IS A VERY EASY READ AND ENJOYABLE I READ ALL THREE BOOKS WITHIN TWO WEEKS. LOVED IT !!!!"
3,Not much better than the first book,"As with the first book in the series, this was a fair book, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone that is looking for more classic, Medieval action, and I don't mean under the sheets.The storyline continues to be a bit far fetched in consideration with the time period, and I wasn't thrilled with the allusions to mythical gods. The main character, Anne, is likable enough but again far fetched. The things that she does in the book just wouldn't have happened, especially in a merchant system that existed during that time. It bordered on a fantasy novel.The romance was a bit too steamy for me. I would have liked a little more battle action. Also, the sex scenes are WAY TOO GRAPHIC. It would be an ""R"" rated book.All in all, it was OK. Just OK."
1,wrong product received,I received the wrong product and i wasn't enrolled in super saver shipping when my value did exceed $25 grrr
2,I thought it would be awesome.,"When i started potty training my son i thought this product was genius. Installing it was a little difficult. My son could sit on it very well. But when he sits down to go poo poo, and then pees, the pee comes out the cracks. So i'm always having to clean up pee every time he goes poo poo. The piece of plastic that comes down that's supposed to block the pee pee should be longer, and then this would be perfect."
4,"'Connecticut Yankee,' plus sex","Similar storyline to Twain's 'Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' - only this time, it's a Polish engineer in 13th century Poland.It's a fun read, although I found it a bit convenient that the hero was an engineer - it would have been much more fun & challenging if the hero only had a rudimentary knowledge of how things worked.A similar book to these that I'd also reccommend is 'Enchantment' by Orson Scott Card. That book and the Stargard series are the only time-travelling in Poland fantasy books I'm aware of."
3,Engineer Porn,"I bet the author was a short, unattractive geek. I bet you half my house. And possibly a pedophile.The protagonist, an engineer who finds himself in the past, is tall and perfect and the (mostly 14 year old) ladies are throwing themselves at him. Like David Brin's [book:The Practice Effect|101893], our hero finds himself in a relatively uncivilized place where he can show his technology to the natives. Unlike The Practice Effect, The Cross-Time Engineer reads like a fat boy's dream diary. This book wasn't about the plot, it was about the other characters loving and being in awe of the protagonist.That being said, it was fun. If you hate Mary Sue and the 'women are objects' point of view, stay far away. I'm going to classify this one as a guilty pleasure and vehemently deny ever giving it more than one star if you ask me about it to my face."
5,A riveting read!,"This is a great book and a great series - taking an excellent idea and executing it perfectly. It almost certainly is aimed at a male audience, but women should enjoy it too if they aren't too offended 0:)"
4,A very entertaining overview of safety,"This video covers it all--water safety, auto safety, bike safety, gun safety, and anything else you can think of, geared toward kids preschool-elementary age. It's kind of corny but my preschoolers loved it and want to watch it again and again. We originally got it at the library but I liked it enough to buy my own copy."
5,great GREAT cd,"do not hesistate to buy this cd. excellent.if you like Matchbox 20 ,Train ,The Calling ,you will love this cd. real songs with melodies and words. a must have."
5,BEST ALTERNATIVE ALBUM EVER!!,"Best ALbum ever, excellent lyrics. Really worth buying..Buy also the Live album of Dishwalla!!!"
4,Gorgeous rock for the mature crowd...,"One of my favorite albums this year. JR's passionate vocals and some beautiful guitar and percussion work (tablas!), highly recommended to those who've had it with pop and angry frat boy rap metal."
4,Simply good.,"This is a FANTASTIC album. It burns the heart with it's bittersweet melodies and it hurts to call it ""pop""; something which is getting a bad rap these days. One of my dad's students was best friends with the lead, J.R. Richards, back when they were in 5th grade and he had talked to him again a few years ago. Richards used to play instruments at the same time when he was younger and though he's the lead singer now, people should know that he has a much more vast array of musical talents. He's truly connected with his work and it shows. His voice is beautiful, clear and full of emotion. It wouldn't be strange if tears started to well in your eyes after some of these songs. They are all mostly sad in tone with rich melodies. Definitely not the music which defines ""pop"" now. Think sweetness of the late 80's and early 90's. Just listen to the samples, you'll get what I mean. YOU WON'T REGRET PURCHASING THIS ALBUM."
5,"Intelectualy pleasing to the mind, body, and soul.","Jr's Voice flows through this album not like the other albums. This time he wants you to take him home.?? Take him home and listen over and over, and you will want to take HIM home with you."
5,My favorite CD,I bought Opaline in June and truly have not listened to any other music. I play it in the car and at work all the time. I love each of the songs! The lyrics have meaning which you don't find alot of these days and the songs just stick in your head. I love it!
5,This one is addicting!!!!,"I don't know what it is, but this one is stuck in my cd player!! JR's voice just reaches into your soul. His voice is hypnotizing and you can feel the music! I have introduced several friends to Dishwalla and I think this CD will bring them the fame the so deserve. I have been a fan since 95, their first 2 cd's are great. They definately have their own sound!Crank it up and feel it!"
5,Kirby Vaccuum Refill Bags,I have a great vacuum but the refill bags are difficult to find at a reasonable price until now. This dealer's prices are very competative and the delivery was fast. Thank you for such great customer service.
1,Kirby's suck,"These are listed to fit into the G6 series Kirby vacuums. Unfortunately, they didn't fit my vacuum. Luckily, I was able to rid myself of that colossal burden."
3,Not the item I anticipated getting,"I had ordered Hepa Kirby Diamond Series vaccuum bags before, so I assumed that Amazon was recommending a reorder of the exact same cloth bags. I ordered two packs to get free shipping, and I was disappointed when I received brown paper bags instead of the white cloth bags I had received previously. I will no longer assume Amazon will recommend the same items purchased previously."
5,Great deal and very fast delivery,I don't have time to go to the store to try and find bags that fit my vacume cleaner. I found this company a few years ago and have been ordering from them ever since. I find that ordering in bulk works best - the price is good and the delivery is extremely quick.
5,Vacuum bags,The vacuum bags were exactly what I needed and were very inexpensive compared to what I had been paying for them!!! They were shipped extremely quick also!!
3,"Not the Kirby bags, but work just as well.","The bags I got in the mail were not made by Kirby, and did not have the Kirby brand anywhere on the packaging/product, so minus two stars for false advertising. The bags do however, work just as well on my Ultimate G - Diamond Edition, so by and large, no complaints. They are still cheaper than calling the Kirby distributors and ordering the overpriced bags. I will buy more in the future, but they should at least be honest with the pictures and advertise the real product."
3,"Wrong bag, one zip tie, good to go...","The connection is clearly wrong, but if you cut part of the cardboard collar and add a zip tie, you are good."
4,These Kirby Bags,"Long life, HEPA bags that work in our Kirby. We can actually empty them and use them again because they are well-made. The seller sent the order promptly and packaged correctly."
4,psiquiatrico,Me gusto mucho y me hizo pensar mas.....Ademas arendi sobre enfermedades mentales q muchos padecemos y creemos son normales como la amargura (vitriolo) q vemos en tantas personas.
4,Interesting read,"Got introduced to Paulo Coelho through ""The Alchemist"". This book delivered what it promised in the write-ups. I was expecting a little something different at the end. It kind of built up and then ended. And was hoping for more depth from the character. Then again, I am not an author, so easy for me to say."
5,Poetic and a book you will not put down after one reading,"The poetic writing and rythm of Coelho will take you on a journey into the self-reflefction and spiritual rebirth of a girl who is young, pretty, and seemingly has everything - but decides to die.You witness a girl who has forced herself to stop feeling to rediscover hate as well as joy. You see how the unconditional and self-sacrificing love of parents can cause a child anguish and guilt for wanting to be individual rather than living up to their expectations.And as Veronika allows herself to feel emotions, and live life to its fullest in a way only a person with only five days left to live can; you witness the impact it has on others around her, as well as yourself.Coelho takes you on a journey to rediscover that every day, we have choices - and we make choices - in living our lives the way we live it today."
3,A bit disappointing...,"If you have read Coelho's more famous novel, The Alchemist, and are expecting a similar read, you will be disappointed. Although still a good read, the book is nowhere near as involved. The plot and the characters are very straightforward. There were a couple of plot twists but hardly any surprises. Imagery wasn't abundant but at least it seemed to be the right amount and the characters were well-balanced. Not a horrible waste-of-time but I just expected more from Coelho.One piece of advice if you want to read it... wait for the paperback. The story is too short of a read (it's really a novella) to spend your money on the hardback."
3,veronika descides to die,i knew that the author must have lives the experience in the book . after reading it yes he did in life.
4,Deciding to Die,"I left this book with a strange sensation...a feeling that I had gained something, or won something back, which I had lost. I couldn't quite put my finger on it until a few moments passed. It was the appreciation and beauty of life. I decided to buy this book because I, too, had decided to die. Coming away from the book, most of my lingering thoughts have left...I don't want to dive into the personal, but I do recommend this book for anyone who might be feeling the pressures of leading a seemingly meaningless life.I was a bit put-off by the author's Vonnegutian interruption in the very beginning. I think we could have done without it; it did not make the story any better or any less. You forget he was even in the story by the time you read the next chapter."
4,Open your eyes,"Wow! This book was awesome! Sometimes routine does seem pretty crazy, and when you think far away from outside the box you still get the crazy look. So, might as we look crazy doing the things that makes you happy. This is definitely a 're-read to keep me in check."
3,Not the Alchemist,"I really, really enjoyed the Alchemist and figured I might enjoy some of his other works as well. It really was just okay. Worth the read if you can borrow it?? Not that it is terribly expensive just not what I was looking for."
2,Veronika Decides To Die,"I found this to be an unlikable book; it was difficult to read. There were difficulties in following changes of character when speaking and many changes in point of view through out the book.I knew from early in the book that Veronika was not dying of heart disease. The clues were far from subtle, more like a hammer. Few women dying of heart disease could go through the the extended sexual climaxes that she did,nor ""trudge"" up a hill, nor get totally drunk, nor stay up all night walking around.The ending was disappointing as was the entire book.The ending was very abrupt and left the reader with many unanswered questions."
3,Veronika Decides to Die: A Review,"The book wasn't too bad, mostly just consists of Paulo developing characters and background stories without any real plot or purpose. Actually the reading is just fine, it's just a waste of time."
5,Glad to see the negative reviews,"I was wondering whether to read ""11 Minutes"" by Paulo Coelho, but now I definitely will! I have read - and loved - ""The Alchemist,"" ""The Pilgrimage,"" ""The Fifth Mountain,"" ""The Valkyries,"" as well as ""Veronika Decides to Die."" The bad reviewers show how bad their taste is! As Madeleine Murray O'Hare strenthened my faith by her hateful atheism, so have the bad reviewers caused me to resolve to read more Paulo Coelho!"
4,Learning to live when you no longer have to be sane,"Despite its rather bleak title, Veronika Decides to Die, is actually an exploration of what it means to be alive and to live an honest life. It explores the experience of a young woman, who, having survived a suicide attempt, finds herself in a mental asylum. Freed from the pressures of being sane, she is able to explore who she is and how she longs to live her life. I've avoided this book for a long time, largely because of the title, but it's actually a beautiful book, and one of Coelho's best. There's a messy bit at the beginning where Coelho awkwardly inserts himself in the story, tying his own much publicised time in mental institutions to the story, but once you get beyond that it's an inspiring read about leading an authentic life."
3,Awareness of death,"I've read Veronica decides to die after a recommendation from a very avid reader. If you read Alchemist, you can understand why Coelho writes the way he does. to me, his writings are away of depicting the human nature, and challanging it with it's own dreams. that's how Veronica got trapped in between her dreams and her reality.The plot was strong, but how people were quickly effected by Veronica was too fast, they didn't have the chance to know her well to be in any way a change in their lives. that's the only downpart i see.but you just can't resist a Coelho story!"
4,I read this in the book store,"Yes indeed! I finished this cover to cover at the bookstore while waiting to pick up my friend from the hospital (who btw is a new father congrats!)First and foremost as a reader: understand that this book has been translated from Portuguese. Coelho is a Brazilian and of course their native language isn't english, so for all the elitist reviews here saying this is not a real piece of literature then I feel sorry for you. I'm sorry because you can't let your guard down and enjoy books for what they are.For me, I absolutely love books that provoke strong emotions, deep thought, and introspection. This book hit me closer than any other because I've had issues regarding mental health so you better believe that the whole spectrum of emotions was felt.I know I don't fall in love with every book I read; if I don't like it then I'll just say, ""I didn't like it."" Appreciate the work and thought thats been put through and move on!"
5,Thought Provoking,Only when Veronika knows she is dying does she begin to live. How we could all learn from that lesson. Read this book. You will enjoy it and you will never take life for granted again.
3,Not as impressed as I'd hoped to be,"This book came highly recommended and I just wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. I appreciate the message, but unless you come from a different generation (I am gen X), being a little crazy is what life is all about. I can imagine that this book would be a real eye opener to individuals whose creativity has been stifled, but I don't know that world so it was hard for me to relate to the characters in the book."
3,Live like you were dying,"A good friend suggested that I read this novel during a difficult time in my life. I was hesitant at first, however, after reading the first chapter i was hooked. Many reviewers have said that this novel is about redemption, and it truly is. Life stops for no one. And just when you think life is over, that's when you get the will to live."
4,one of my favorites,"I read this book in English soft cover edition and finished it last week.This is the first book of Paulo Coelho that I've read.Paulo Coelho tells empathically and very beautifully stories of different characters that converge into a one coherent and thought provoking novel. I have a problem with the title (Veronika Decides To Die) as naming it amongst your favorites might indicate that you might need to be looking for psychiatric assistance too :)I did not like the ending as I found it to be of lesser standard than the rest of the book, but maybe it's just a matter of taste.I have no doubt I'll try another one of his very soon..."
2,Disappointing,"If you expect the class you saw in the Alchemist, it will certainly disappoint you. If you are mood off/depressed, and what you want is a little peace of mind and happiness, don't read this book at all. A person with suicidal depression (who already possesses lots of negative energy or thoughts) may get more ideas to commit suicide. And if you really want to read it, better you follow it up with some spiritual stuff or read the Alchemist once again!"
1,"Go ahead, throw your money away...","Please, do not be fooled. Though Paulo Coelho has been translated to many languages and sells fortunes, he is NOT one of the better Latin American writers. No one takes him seriously in Brazil. This, as are his other books, is a bunch of supposedly profound thoughts thrown together and poorly written. There are better books in the self-help section. If you want the real thing, get a book of chinese proverbs."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I would have rather given this book half of ONE star. This was one of those books that you regret reading. What a waste of my time! Personally, Coelho should have written an apology inside the book jacket instead of the sypnosis."
3,First time reading Paulo,"So this was his first title I've read. I really wanted to give it more stars but I couldn't do it.It was easy to relate to Veronika, I think he wrote her beautifully. It ends up being an uplifting book and yes, there are a few things to learn in this book. He actually introduces me to a few subjects I'd like to look further into and honestly gave me a new perspective on a few things. I really liked that about this book.I don't think the asylum and a lot of the activities are based in reality. Though I'm not speaking from any personal knowledge what-so-ever. Just what I imagine to be my truth of those institutions. But I will say it could be different from what I envision because it's more like a private hospital.All and all, I'm not a ""faith"" type person, but I liked his writing style, his character development wasn't bad and I read the book faster than I do most. I will also admit that it's thinner than the other books I read as well!Annette"
2,overrated,"it took me SO LONG to read this book because it was boring and i kept putting it down. Coelho is heavy- handed with his message- i felt flogged! maybe i just prefer sublety. if i want to be preached to, i'll read a self-help book."
1,This Book is a Failure,"I have some personal experience with the subject matter, but that is really not relevant to my criticisms of the book. I found Coelho's writing style very distant and not very engaging. The ending is a cheap hollywood trick and fails to bring any real insight on the subject matter. The body of the work is told from a very distant perspective and the reader is never drawn into the story. A waste of time and money!"
1,This isn't literature,"This is NOT literature. If you thought the Da Vinci Code was a great book, you will probably like it. If you're into REAL literature, don't even try. Read something by Saramago instead, now that's a real writer."
2,Looking elsewhere for better service,"When I ordered this book, I specifically looked for a used book seller on the west coast, where I live, for the ability to receive the book timely. It took me TWO WEEKS to receive the book from one state over! I ordered a book in ""good"" condition and it arrived with the spine almost falling out. Not good condition at all, as compared to previously ordered books from other vendors.I will look elsewhere for my used books in the future."
1,Cheap Literature for Lazy Readers!,If you like cheap literature and you are lazy reader this is a great book. Easy to digest! There is no profound literary education in this work. Cheap literature for cheap readers!!!!
5,I Decide To Love This Book,"This book is one of the most amazing books that I've read. I read it in one sitting (something I did not expect to do). The book is not about suicide, as it seems... it's about living, and *learning* to live. It is a beautiful, tragic miracle, and I would recommend it to anyone who cares to read it."
3,made an impact,"My favorite parts of the story were that of the other patients', namely Mari and Eduard. As for Veronika's own story, I didn't really relate and felt that her life was too perfect and the ending of her story too magical.Though I wasn't inspired by Veronika herself, the story made me understand how short a human's life on earth really is. After reading the book I thought about what I wanted to do with the little time given to me on earth.""Veronika Decides to Die"" is not really a profound read, but I have no complaints about it being boring. I will recommend this book to young people bored with their life -- I think after reading it they can be impacted like I was.This story hopes to tell everyone to treasure life. It is also a short read. For its important message, I'll give it three stars and overlook its other flaws."
4,Thumbs up!,"Not the best but certainly worth a read (slightly gritty, if anything a little strange). Its perhaps the honesty of the book and the main characters feelings or lack of feelings towards the purpose of her life that makes it quite a harsh read but one with great meaning behind it. I didn't find my self sympathising with the characters trouble but instead I found my self willing her on to rediscover and appreciate her life once again. Certainly a book that gets you thinking, some interesting points are made. Definitely a clever idea to the story, one undoubtedly film worthy. If you liked the craziness of Girl interrupted then this books for you."
4,Another gem from Paulo Coelho,"I so much enjoy Paulo Coelho's writing. It's simple, meaningful, and always carries with it a life lesson. What would you do if you knew you had a short time to live? What would you do if you miraculously survived, but weren't sure when you might die anyways? I would definitely get my fill of love and books by Paulo Coelho."
2,Disappointed,I had not yet read anything by Paulo Coelho and decided to start with Veronika Decides to Die. Must admit that I don't understand what the hype is about as I did not like the book very much. Maybe it is just this book but I do not feel like trying any of his other books.
4,"A good ""self-check"" book","Paulo Coelho's style of writing is so simple, and yet so moving. In this novel he tells of the story of a young woman who tries to commit suicide and recovers in an asylum. He asks a lot of questions about the nature of sanity and insanity, and who, or what, defines what that means. For anyone who has struggled with feeling different, alone, or even fearful for their mental well-being, this book will resonate."
1,Shameful,"Took 3 weeks before I was told there was a mistake somewhere, then another week to get here even though I was promised overnight shipment."
3,Fatal Flaws,"This book is pretty good but it has two fatal flaws:1) All requirements are treated at the same level. There seems to be no recognition of decomposition and definition. There is no explicit recognition that some requirements exist at the system level, some at the segment level, some at the sub-system level, etc., and that lower level requirements must be derived from higher level requirements.2) The Robertsons go from requirements to specifications without ever considering system implementation concepts or architecture. Specifications can be written only if there is a concept or architecture against which the specification may be written. The specification for tracking migrating animals will be different if one has a concept based on tracking animals using radio collars than if the concept is to track them using acoustic sensors, visual observation, infrared sensors, etc.FCP"
5,Solid Practical Coverage of the Requirements Process,"This book should be on the shelf of every Business Analyst professional. It provides excellent step-by-step guidance with solid illustrations and example material. It has a solid balance between academic theory and pragmatic goodies that every Business Analyst can utilize. Material presented is comprehensive, well-structured, and easily understandable. The customization applied in the 2nd edition relative to Agile theory is well presented and balanced. No hesitation in recommending the book."
3,Boring,"I found this book to be quite dry, and often wanted to put it down. It seems that it could have been much shorter and direct to the point. It insteads seems tp stretch out chapters with not-so-useful information. Reading the blurbs in the margin, is probably the best way to read this book.However, there is a lot of good information, if you can stay away through the reading."
2,Who is this book for,"This is an academic document of someone who has participated on the process of gathering requirements.The detail of every chapter, the context of the user, roles, the things to consider, the tips, the relations to other systems, the different kinds of requirements, the guides, the testing, all is there and complete. But it belongs to the classroom.I was looking for a book that I can lend to the people in my organization so we can improve in our actual development process. There are no tips on how to use formats like the Use Case, it does not even appear on any page. Nor does it show the actual deliverables to the analysis and development team or suggestions on traceability for testing on the final product.The writer has taken care on keeping things open so people could discuss, improve or use alternate approaches. But software development needs standards and method, there are no suggestion on how you can improve on these."
5,A complete methodology,"This is a must read book if you are involved in the software lifecycle process. The book is suited for both experts and novices in the requirements elicitation process. It contains the concepts, the process, and a ""quality gateway"" complement. The resulting specifications document is complete enough. It isn't an abstract book, but a practical one that follows a sample case from its conception to the final document delivery to the project management team (though it doesn't contains project management concepts). There are a few ambiguous sections in the proposed document, but they aren't an obstacle for its implementation. Additional documentation and tools are available on Volere's web site."
5,Christmas Gift,Purchased this book for a friend and she loves it. The pictures are so beautiful. I would buy this book again.
5,Quality is tops for SHS,"I am a nurse for the Susquehanna Health System. I was very upset re: the comments from A reader from Williamsport, VA re: the Press Ganey Results and SHS. Quality patient care has been our top priority for years. In both the 1999 and the 2003 Press Ganey results Nursing at SHS was amoung the top 2% not the bottom. From the Corporate Objectives, to our departments performance improvements quality has been our goal. Over the years Tim Manello and all of the corporate staff have guided SHS in our committment to quality. This reader obviously has something against Tim and what a shame they had to be child-like and post it for all to see. I am proud to work for SHS and be a part of the staff. I give Tim's book five stars."
1,not for lesbians or gay men not on the party circuit,"he makes many inappropriate assumptions about the gay community which made it even harder for me to trust his advice. he assumes that no gay or lesbians have children, have parents or relatives, and all have a drug problem. Therefore we are all well ahead of the game financially without children, we shouldn't buy homes because we have no family or ties to an area so we can all move at the drop of a hat to further our careers, and that if we just stopped our drugs we'd be all able to save more money. never once did i see any concrete advice. the whole book is about the psychology behind gay spending and lack of savings on the party circuit."
4,"A Warm, Make You Feel Good Inside Kinda Read....","O.K., so you don't believe there are anymore ""Good Men"" like Terry anymore, who raises his two daughters alone, and can love a woman wholeheartedly, well, at least this book will make you want to change your mind and make you a believer. Parry Brown brings to life the close knit family and friends, the way it used to be when you could depend on each other. She brings to light what so many don't want you to know, or don't want to believe themselves, ""there really are good, hard-working, intelligent brothers in this world taking care of business!"""
5,My favorite......,"I have read quite a few books over the past six months and so far, this is the best. It gave me such a good feeling and yes, it's a non-stop novel. I hated to put it down. I love the characters and storyline. Can't wait for the next one and would love to see this one as a movie. Keep writing gurl!"
5,Very Refreshing,This book was a refreshing change. We sometimes get so wrapped up in dogging out our African American males that we forget that there are GOOD ONES. And lets not forget that there are really some females just like Catherine. Keep up the good work Ms. Ebony Satin.
4,Lets Hear It For the Boys,"This was a great book, a quick read and the message was very clear, although I never had my doubts. Parry Brown exposed the ruthlessness of women with this one-Ms. Catherine Hawkins, unbelievable! The word family and love describe this book to the T. The friendships and love between Terry, Roland, Jackie and Cedes was enjoyable. The children helped shaped their parents and the parents did an excellent job of raising them. Momma C and Teresa were excellent mothers and their childrens' rock. Love of self and of others is the one emotion that can sustain us in times of trouble. Good job Parry Brown!"
5,I love the Book,"Ms Brown, You have come along way in a short time with your first book. The staff here at Much Love 4 Ya Produtions wishes you a peaceful journey with writing and publishing novels in the future"
1,"Can You Say ""Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep""","Who told this child that she could write? I haven't heard her as a motivational speaker, but her writing leaves PLENTY of room to be desired! This story is entirely too sugary and honky-dory. It makes a reader angry to spend their hard earn money on a book that was recommended by lying reviewers, only to be disappointed. And you can't get your money back. The only thing you can do is to give it away or to sell it for the low-low. It would make great for a fire. Just to think some upstanding tree sacrificed its life for something like this."
1,"This book was way too perfect, not realistic","I did not enjoy this book, the plot was not suspenseful. A lot of what the characters were worried about was not even reasonable. The one twist ""Wendell"" that could have been nice was given away early in the story. It is very unrealistic that a African American family would allow a woman into their home (Catherine) that would totally humiliate everyone and they would not even make her leave. I found this book to be very poorly written and very unrealistic."
4,"A Warm, Make You Feel Good Inside Kinda Read","O.K., so you don't believe there are anymore ""Good Men"" like Terry anymore, who raises his two daughters alone, and can love a woman wholeheartedly, well, at least this book will make you want to change your mind and make you a believer. Parry Brown brings to life the close knit family and friends, the way it used to be then you could depend on each other. She brings to light what so many don't want you to know, or don't want to believe themselves, ""there really are good, hard-working, intelligent brothers in his world taking care of business!"" You'll love it!"
5,Positive Vibes all the way,"I truely enjoyed this book. It was really great to see a man represented in a positive light. You have Terry, a single parent trying to raise his twin daughters the best way possible. Jackie, his soul mate, Ronald, his best friend and Mercedes Jackie's ""sister"", all pulling together and supporting one another as a unit. They all tried their best to put some positive light into the trying situation, a nasty woman's plight at selfishness. I really felt the warmth of this book and recommend it to all. Keep up the good work !"
3,KEEP THE SHIRT!,"THE SHIRT OFF HIS BACK is the story of an upscale African American group of family and friends. It's about a lot of love and sharing, and overcoming obstacles. It's OK, but a little too sappy to be believable. This book also should have been edited more carefully. There were a large number of errors and they were distracting. The copy that I read was in its second or third printing. Corrections should have been made by that time."
2,Christian book????,"I would like to know why NONE of the reviews I've come across, so far, address the fact that Terry and his girlfriend, Jackie, engage in sex without being married--and this is supposed to be a CHRISTIAN book. If there was anything to indicate the struggle of lust, temptation, falling, repentance, redemption--any of those themes--I would find it understandable. But what I read of the book does NOTHING to even address this. It might be some nice sugarcoated religious fiction, but there is no gospel in it. Jesus came to DELIVER us from our sin. There's often a wide gap between ""religious"" and ""Christian."""
2,nope!,"I'm sorry but, this book was whack! i couldnt even finish it. i guess it was to unrealistic. After every chapter I kept saying ""yeah right... yeah right... suuuure!!"" and the granny's ebonics were about to drive me up the wall!!! it was sooo irritating! but the whole idea of it was great... The wonderful, loving, strong black man. I appreciate that, but come on now."
4,Excellent Read.,"My friend Roz recommended (and loaned me) this book and I am glad that she did. I really enjoyed this novel. Although the lifestyles of the characters seemed too much of a fairytale, I was still engrossed. I read it rather quickly! You go Ebony Satin!"
3,"Good Read, But Materialistic/Unrealistic","I thought the book was good. It was an easy read. Alittle unrealistic and materialistic, but in the samebreath it was refreshing to read about black peoplewho have excellent careers and about a brother whodoes the right thing. It was annoying that everyonelived happily ever after like fairy tale, but overalla decent book. I did like the twist with Wendellturning out to be the P.I. I kinda thought he wasgoing to be anyway. That was cool. I was just annoyed that the book club I belong to, chose this to read for Black History Month. This book did nothing to inspire or change my life. It was not an eye-opener."
1,No substance.....,Please do not take your readers for granted and just throw a manuscript together and call it a book.... There needs to be more character development...
3,Once Upon A Time In a Land Far Away....,"This story was straight up fairy tale! It just was not believable. Terry was too good to be true and so was Jackie. I mean, this was a blended family but none of the blended family drama was ever discussed, i.e. jealousy, sibling rivalry, discipline, etc. It seems everybody just fell in line with what their wonderful roles would be in a perfect world.The green eyed stranger bit was very predictable. I knew from the moment she began the conversation with him in the limo that he was the trump card. Oh, well......I enjoyed the book because it was an escape from reality. I look forward to her next book because I feel she has potential."
3,Are All Brides Beautiful?,"This is a photo album of generic brides of all persuasions and ages, some beautiful, others no so pretty -- one looked like a princess. There is even one at a nudist colony, for a total of 61 brides, three of children playing grown-up, and various others. Some from foreign countries, some in the country, city, parks, the inner city, and churches.Right in the middle of the book we find JFK and Jackie out in the country on their wedding day -- the reason I purchased this book of pictures.Some of the photographers had a sense of humor, with the use of awkward backgrounds and, in one instance, the foreground with a windblown crumbled up newspaper. The editors, Marla Kennedy and Susan Martin, endeavored to ""open your heart and eyes to a world of feelings and artistic imagination.""This book celebrates matrimony with its rituals of gown, bouquet ross, cake, and accroutements. Most of the pictures will make you smile, and remember your big day!"
3,13 Principals,"I do like this book, it gives more insight into the 13 Principals of Faith but unless you're very familiar with Judaism, Torah and Talmud study etc... it can be difficult to read. This is the type of book that should come with an explanation of how it is set up and what the notes on the principals mean. There could be a class that is held with this book as the format. I have an orthodox Torah study partner and he had a little difficulty trying to explain the way this book is written. I did teach me a good bit of information though."
1,Partners in Ignorance,"Steve Jackson writes this book for the family of the victim of a heinous crime. He stomps his foot up and down and bemoans the injustice of the justice system, unfortunately, his foot is stomping on the US Constitution. The book slanders defense attorneys and Judges that Jackson doesn't even interview or, it seems, attempt to contact. Jackson admits that it was written with cooperation only from the prosecutors and the victims family presenting a completely one sided, liablous,travesty that does not even attempt to explain the justice system and does not mention the Constitution, the foundation of the justice system; once."
1,Pompus techs with lack of knowledge of their own products,"Been a Mac guy for 8 years, love the computers hate the Apple Support.Spent two hours on the phone with incredibly snooty techs. In the end I was told ""it's not designed to share it's ethernet connection over it's Airport card"". Uh- been doing it for 4 years with the old imac and emac. His analogy- Just because you can drive your Lamborghini on a dirt road doesn't mean it was designed to do it"". That's great.... Got hung up too by Apple SupportUnfortunately for Mr. Techie what I'm trying to accomplish is documented exactly on Apples own web support. Basically I've got a bad Airport card or a software conflict and Apple Support is of no help. If you've got an issue, you're on your own.Spending 10 years in IT support for windows I know it's not an easy job, but their attitudes along with their lack of knowledge about their own products disgust me.Great computer, terrible support."
1,Shipment problem,"Unfortunately, the box contained the wrong product, differing from label on the box. I ordered the product for the iMac; the box contained the product for the laptop. I spent several hours on the phone trying to work with personnel in India trying to get this straightened out. I had to pay for the new product and request a refund (through a complicated procedure), which I have yet to receive. Communicating with the help desk was a nightmare."
4,Insurance policy for your Mac,"This is one of those hard things to review since it's essentially an insurance policy for your Mac. I haven't had to use it yet, so my experience has been non-existent, but I do have the peace of mind that if I do need it, it is there for me."
4,Arrive on time.,Talking about the order: it came on time and perfect conditions. Talking about the product: it is sadly a must have because apple produce excellent products but that always fail in something so better have it guys.
5,Applecare for iMac,"Purchased this package to give my iMac another two years under warranty. Hope I don't have to use it, but it does offer piece of mind."
1,Using history for a religious agenda - terrible,"If you want a drive through history in which Christians are always right and everybody else is wrong, then this is the program for you. If you are more interested in an unbiased look at history, keep looking. I put my copy of this DVD straight in the trash after watching it."
4,Beautiful book. Nice work of historical fiction.,"Some Native American nations thought dreams were significant--sacred even. This is a beautiful take on dreams, with the historical Mohawk interpreter as a central character. I enjoyed it immensely. Nice cover too."
2,Nice book with a caveat,"I purchased this book for use in a veterinary hospital waiting area. Overall it is a beautiful celebration of the human-animal bond. Unfortunately the pictorial of Robbie Williams with a leashed, lingerie-clad woman at his feet is an inappropriate addition and is degrading to women. It's hard to understand why the author chose to include it."
3,You have better options.,"This book offers practice in left-hand and right-hand arpeggios,thirds, slurs, staccato, repeated notes, chromatic and diatonic scales, and triplets.It is satisfactory sightreading exercise, but there are better intermediate piano compositions. Throughout the entire book, there is very little counterpoint and very few chords besides I, IV, and V.Concone, Gurlitt, and Burgmuller are better choices."
3,Alex Toy Makes a Face,"I guess my grandkids like this.............it didn't thrill me, and I wouldn't buy it again."
3,"Great idea, poor execution","We were very excited to get our daughter this toy, because she was definitely lacking in good bath toys. She did have some fun with it, but the pieces don't stick very well and some of the pieces are just unidentifiable and kind of creepy-looking. We love the concept of this toy, but we're not crazy about this."
2,This book should be called a Unix dictionary,"I was expecting a how-to book, with discussions of topics and tips on interesting things to do, including examples. What I got was an A to Z listing of words/phrases with their definitifions. As long as you know what to look up, it is useful. If you have no idea, this book is not for you."
3,"hard to find, great item","my son went nuts when he got this from Santa, we had looked in every store and he thought santa made it just for him !! thanks !"
5,The Place To Start,"This is the first book I read about Charles Ives, and I'm happy that it's still in print. If you are new to Charles Ives, I would suggest that you start here. If you have the funds, I also recommend you pick up Jan Swafford's excellant biography.Why is this book the best place to start? The book is a compilation of thoughtful and revealing rememberances from Mr.Ives's close friends and his family, all personally interviewed by the author. We even get to hear what Mr.Ives's barber had to say about him! Perhaps most moving is the interview with Brewster, Mr.Ives's nephew.This book is also chock full of photos and pictures of Mr.Ives's original manuscripts."
2,Item number wrong,"This was for a school assignment. We ordered it using the ISN number, but the book we received was the wrong edition. We had to go to Barnes & Noble to buy the right one."
3,Used Attitude Book,"Book was received in a timely fashion ans was shipped in a secure fashion so as not to damage it. I had a DISCARD stamp with the date July 19, 2001 on the inside cover. The pages had yellowed. Otherwise it was in good and usable shape.Attitude Is Everything: Change Your Attitude...and You Change Your Life!"
2,Not Recommended......,This book is a good waste of time. A real exercise in BS. My wife read it after me and was equally repelled by it. I won't go into details...just avoid it.
5,Fantastic!,"Great book and a short easy read packed with information and things that are easy to put into practice but that one might not have thought about before. Both my 13 year old son and 10 year old daughter (almost done) have read it too. Although the reviews from them were not great, I already see where it has made a difference and we can talk about how to put it into action for the better since we have the same foundation to work off of. I can't think of a single person I know who would not gain some positive benefit from spending the small amount of time reading it. Happy improving of yourself!!"
1,"""Splash"" by Jane Seymour",I gave this book to my twin granddaughters. They both enjoy reading and listening as I read to them.They also enjoy Dr. Seuss books.
5,Adorable!!!,"It's small, cute, easy to use and afordable. I made pasta las week and it worked great. I live in Manhattan so beside being functional everything has to save me some storage too and this rolling pin has both :P"
4,Short rolling pin,I bought several of these rolling pins as gifts. They are a nice weight but I was somewhat dissappointed in the length. I thought they were longer. They roll very nice but you have to move it back and forth a lot becuase of the width of the pin. It works well.
2,Easily Cracks,"I probably should not have washed this in the dishwasher, but I need a dishwasher safe rolling pin. This was not it. After first use it cracked. It wasn't so horrible that I couldn't use it, but one would think that someone makes a dishwasher safe wooden rolling pin."
3,"A good read, but not a good reference guide","I was looking for a great reference book that would quickly answer my questions. Unfortunately, this book must be read thoroughly (or at least a chapter at a time). The index could have been much, much more detailed. As it stands, the index is an afterthought, and a very bad one at that. With a better index, this could be a reference book. As it stands, it's still worth the read. I'll still be looking for a better reference guide, though."
3,Helpful but outdated,"In general this is a helpful book for those new to the industry. However, I found it alarming that there has been no revision to this book since the internet bubble, 9/11, the corporate financing scandals of the early 00's, and the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley. I'm curious about whether Bruce Marcus's newer book might be a better reference."
3,"Nice, but big","This arrived fine and was a well-made product. Nice enough, but was bigger a nd heavier than expected, so gave away."
2,Truly one of the worst!,"If you must read anything with a vampire in it, then go ahead. If you like Harlequin Romances, ok. If your only criteria is that the author be able to construct a reasonable sentence, maybe.... If you are looking for a steamy vampire novel, this isn't it!!! Try I burn For You by the other Susan, Susan Sizemore or maybe something by Laurell K. Hamilton. When I lost this book part way through, I was thrilled I didn't have to finish it; but sadly, someone found it and returned it to me. Don't find yourself in that situation. ;-)"
2,Not what I was expecting,"Being an avid romance reader (of the supernatural), I picked this book up thinking it sounded good. I was fooled into thinking this would be a good romance when, in fact, it seemed far from it! While reading, I was disappointed in Davenoff as a vampire. The entire time he was in trouble, I kept expecting him to somehow regain strength and escape. I was sorely disappointed. I was also frustrated with Sarah and Corrine. I couldn't understand why Sarah was friends with Corrine since they were so different. And Corrine's involvement in the whole affair just ruined the desirable image I had at first about Davenoff. After somehow managing to read this book, I realized the whole romance aspect toward the end was cold. Sarah didn't fall for Davinoff for himself. She was pitied into loving him. I think everything she felt for him was just pity. To all the readers out there looking for something new in the romance genre, don't look here!"
4,Regency or Vampire?,"This was an enjoyable mixture of a formula Regency with a twist-sex, drugs and a vampire! The novel was well written, the characters not too evil or goody goody and the story line was fairly fast moving. Good read."
2,Wow..,"First off, I completely agree with the person who wrote a review right before mine. Two hours of my life I will NEVER get back, indeed. The story DID have potential to be good, but the author had horrible character development in the first half of the book to allow me enjoy the characters. I will admit the ending was good, I liked the way it turned out.. But honestly, the first 200 pages were brutal. I couldn't quite figure out how a love relationship could development with the heros when there was nothing in the first half of the book to allow them to really interact! I don't recommend this as a first vampire romance novel, try another one of her books because most of them are fairly written. I expected more from Susan Squires having read 'The Companion' before 'Sacrament'."
1,Not that Great,This book wasent that great. It was verry confusing there were so many different stories going on at on time it was hard to keep track. And the romance between the two main characters dosent happen till the last two chapters and it's verry rushed.All in all this was not the best that I've ever read.
2,not that good,"The first 117 pages were boring and could of been cut to one chapter and not drag. There was a point were I thought Sarah and Julien were never going to get together. During the first 200 pages the authur never gave any indication that they had and attraction towards each other. They sleep together one night almost towards the end of the book, and they realize oh we love each other. Also the book had about three parts that should of been identify. It was like three stories, with the same characters. I got to say I was not happy with this read. I can say Sarah character was well developed, her character matures through out the story. Corina was a real psycho for a villain. Julien was a boring hero."
1,A Waste of Time,"I usually go through a book in about 5 days. After a week and a half and still only being a third of the way through, I finally had enough of this book. Davinoff just seems to be an object in the book and not a character. Corina is evil through and through. And really if Corina is your BEST friend and she treats you like a doormat then you have enough problems without throwing a vampire in the mix. Do yourself a favor & DO NOT read this book. It seemed to have such potential for the 1st 10 or so pages then it just nose-dived. Perhaps the author had alot of ideas and wasn't sure of direction. Hopefully I can unload this book at my local used bookstore."
2,Digital Wizardry,"Digital Wizardry is not a tutorial nor a ""How to"" book but a ""How I did It"" book describing the author's step-by-step creation of a selection of complex Photoshop images from the inception of an idea to finished commercial product. This book is geared for the accomplished professional, preferably in the advertising field. However, one must be fully competent in the use of advanced Photoshop skills to utilize the described techniques. For that target audience this book could warrant 4 stars (I don't qualify to judge). For a beginner, its usefulness is limited.Good production quality and nice photos but it should be clearly marketed to an advanced audience."
3,Decent strings if they fit,"D'Addario Chromes are OK flatwound strings, though they're a high-tension string, about the same as their XL's (roundwounds) in the department. Unfortunately, the short-scale set did not fit my Guild Starfire bass (much too short!). It wasn't just a case of buying the wrong set like an idiot, either. The long-scales fit better but not perfectly, and these short-scale Chromes don't even fit a Fender Mustang bass OR a violin bass-- I tried them with both those instruments in an effort to get some use out of these strings.In light of the fit problems, I would skip these strings. Who knows what 'short scale' bass they're supposed to fit."
3,A different slice of history,"This is an interesting slice of history, from a specific point of view in regards to the perfume industry, and while it was interesting, it wasn't a compelling book where you hurried to turn the page and see what happens next. If you are interested in scents, perfumes, and related topics, its a good read, but if those aren't serious interests, this book would be a real chore to read. Its well written, just not particularly ""lively"" along the way."
5,Absolutely amazing book,"I've dabbled for years with essential oils and always was at a loss to describe their effects and sensations. The man that the book is telling us about is a true Victorian polymath: a multifaceted scientist, an effete snob, an accurate, passionate descriptive writer of the senses.I laughed out loud dozens of times, was driven mad with desire to smell some of these substances and perfumes, was angered by the intransigence of the scientific community.This is just a great and fascinating read, gliding effortlessly between topics with great irony and clarity."
3,"Scientific, Interesting ... but drudgery.","I love scents and always have and expected that I would have found synchronicity with ""The Emporer of Scent"". I ordered this book based on my love of perfumes and the sense of smell--I should have known that it was going to be a heavyweight read.When reading it, I found the heavy emphasis on science (chemistry specifically) a snoozer. The book was somewhat interesting in topic but heavy on the science and some algorithms (Turin's smell theory and smell algorithm). Perhaps it was needed, but the book lacked the fun factor for me.I rated it average because this book felt extremely academic and moved at a slow pace. I expected a book that a lot more fun to read. For me, this book was not fun."
3,"Good Read, but kindle buyers beware: you can't loan it.","I enjoyed the book, but was unhappy to see that I can't loan it to a friend. Pretty lame, Random House."
2,not quite what I expected,"I freely admit that science is not necessarily my strong suit. I have nothing against it, but I often get lost around a mental corner. I have to admit that this is what happened with this book. The author conveyed his enthusiasm for the subject and for maverick scientist Luca Turin, but to be honest, I didn't quite understand what all the enthusiasm was about, and I am not sure I liked Turin as much as the author did. I got a little tired of Turin, actually, long before the author did. The aspect of the science of scent was interesting, to a certain extent, but after a point I found myself skipping passages that seemed to go on too long and get too mired in arcane scientific specifics. Overall I don't think this is a general readership book as much as it is a text that could be useful for someone in the field."
2,"Engaging story, but bad science","Having read enthusiastic reviews of this book, I was surprised to find it ill-informed about olfaction science. I'm a biologist in a related field and I had never heard of Turin before, but after I finished ""The Emperor of Scent,"" I read Turin's scientific papers. His ideas are interesting, but he hasn't done controlled experiments to support or refute them. Unfortunately, the background information that Burr provides to support Turin's ideas is frequently inaccurate. Burr is a good writer and seems to have done some background reading, so it's all the more disappointing that he doesn't subject Turin's work to greater scrutiny. This book was a fun read, but take it with a grain of salt."
5,"For Perfume-Lovers, Biology Nerds, and Curious Minds","This is one of those rare un-put-downable books. It's unusual to find a book on science that is so highly, compellingly readable. It weaves together stories of science in theory and in practice (amazing discoveries, long years of research, stubborn hidebound resistance) and both the allure and industry of perfume, through the figure of Luca Turin. The story focuses on the scientist's lifelong obsession with perfume (the book is a must-read for any woman who wears classics like Chanel No. 5, Rive Gauche, or Shalimar) and his determination to unlock the mystery of how we smell--and the science community's determination to ignore his compelling conclusions."
5,A good read for a WIDE range of readers,"Do you like Chemistry? Botany? History? Biographies? Travel? Dare I say...poetry? It is all in this amazing book, with the heartfelt desciptives of a poet's soul. Personally, I have no understanding of the physics and chemisty aspect, but I did not find that daunting, it was rather like reading a bit of science fiction that has dialog like ""But there is too much floozelbam!"" ""That is NOT floozelbam, it is flubbernoo. Ah HA!"" It was an enjoyable adventure, fully satisfying."
3,"Not the best, but definitely not the worst.","As a textbook, the organization and presentation of the topics could be better; however, the book contains some good ideas."
3,a bottle of joy...,"Quinn is sick of her boring, loveless life. She knows this summer will be different. She finds a bottle in the ocean, with a letter inside from a nine year old boy named Dashell. The next day, she meets him:only now he is a handsome teenager the same age as her! They are instantly attracted to each other. The only problem is that Quinn is a townie, and Dash is a rich summer vacationer. Scared that he'll reject her if he discovers her lower status, Quinn begins to lie about herself. Problems with a jealous rich girl and Quinn's lies put her budding relationship in jeopardy. Soon Quinn's only hope for summer love is her message in a bottle.........will she overcome everything for love?"
2,Unrealistic,"I thought that the book was sweet and charming, but it just didn't seem real. It was too fake and the problems that ""Threatened their relationship"" were stupid. When the lies came out it seemed that it would ruin everything but they were resolved in just sentences. It wasn't a realistic story line and I wish that it could have been more related to the real world."
5,I read this book for my MBA Entrepreneurship class.,"I read Mr. Gillis' book along with an Entreprenuership textbook in my MBA Entrepreneurship class at Houston Baptist Univeristy (HBU) in Houston, Texas.I found Mr. Gillis' book more helpful than the textbook because it was written by someone who personally dealt with the stresses and problems of starting a company and making it successful.P.S. He is just as interesting in person as he is in the book."
4,SVGA Splitter Extender,1st one worked well but was damaged by lightning. So far so good with this one. We use it in a Church to service 3 TVs and it fits our need.
5,STILL SEARCHING FOR MY COPY IN MY MOTHER'S BASEMENT,"I loved this book! I think I still have it... somewhere. I purchased it myself from the bookmobile when I was in elementary school in D.C. I read it again and again, discovering yet another exciting event Chester Filbert was missing while he was so busy complaining. What about the parachuter?! ""Geronimo!"" and the girls jumping rope, the armored car and the money everywhere? And yes, the witch popping up in different windows! Chester's last words... ""when I grow up, I'm going to move."" Well, Chester, I live in NY now, and there's so much happening on my block that I may otherwise take for granted had it not been for you!Love, Nay in NY (all grown up and still loving your words)"
3,Wishful thinking,"I was interested in the Maria Von Trapp story and thought I would make a blind try (with the help of some Amazon reviewers) at this CD. I found it to be a very nice crossover from folk/old time music into other genres. Very nice musicianship, and yes - crystal clear voice. However, her pitch is a bit off at times and the voice a bit piercing at others -- enough to be distracting. Sorry."
4,very useful,"This is a fun prop to have while traveling in the car or plane. My older child, 7 y/o, liked it and was able to make use of it. My younger, 4 years old, didn't get much use out of it. Many of the workbooks and games were too hard of her."
4,Very nice camera,I LOVED this camera and had never used anything but Sony before. It has lasted me 2 years with NO problems whatsoever. I am looking to upgrade to the same model (more megapixels now) but this camera is still awesome! Very easy to use too!
5,This is an excellent summary of some of her class offerings.,"I would reccomend this set of tapes for any healthcare professional interested in becoming more present for the treatment of their clients,or anyone interested in becoming more grounded and centered. Susanne's work in this set is rich with profound meditations. The exercises are challenging as well as liberating. As a Massage Therapist and CrainoSacral Therapist , I have used these tapes with many of my clients and had excellent results. Susanne is able to introduce the use of energy releases in terms that people can understand and utilize. I'm glad that I have my two sets . Now they will be available to all those interested in going deeper into thier mental and physical boundries. The tapes have an uncanny way of getting you to look at your present limitations as opportunities for growth. Absolutely 5 stars."
4,Iron Melting Cupola Furnaces for the Small Foundry,"Stephen D. Chastain's book Iron Melting Cupola Furnaces for the Small Foundry is not a rewrite of information from the past but Steve has designed, built and has in use a cupola furnaces suitable for casting those obsolete iron parts you can no longer find or making proto types all in your back yard (But only if you have vary good neighbors that like you a great deal!). Steve's book has a good mix of practical information and theory. Using his little book, two of my friends and I have taken the detailed information presented and have fabricated a working coke burning cupola furnace (including the blower). I would not have started the project without his book. Steve also gives detailed information on running the furnace to melt iron. His book now kinds its self dog-eared, highlighted, annotated, and returned to often - it is well worth the money."
5,Saddlemen Goldwing Seat,"Not a lot to say, really. Looks great and it fit perfect. You just move your hardware from the old seat to the new seat. Easily done. On the GL100 Aspencade, the top box lid cannot be opened as far as original because of the deep backrest for the passenger. Not a big deal. But nice to know before hand."
3,"good price, but not like the original","When your A/C won't work because of a bad blower motor, you get desperate. So I bought this blower to solve the problem quickly.It is a very good fit, and a good price. However, it emits an annoying whine when running that the OEM blower did not. This is especially evident at low speeds. At higher speeds, the airflow sound tends to mask the whine. Otherwise, it works fine.Maybe it's just this particular one, and not a design problem. I did notice that the blower I received was already 5 years old when I received it, so it had been sitting for quite some time before I ordered it.So, for my 10-year-old Hyundai, it's OK."
5,Roof Mount: works as advertised.,This roof mount was easy to install (so long as you're some what handy.) Has held the antenna on the gable end of my house for over a year now with out issue.
4,Works as expected,Product works as expected... I just wish either the antenna or the bracket came with a pole and you didn't have to buy all of them individually. Installed in my attic.
1,Amazon's cheating advertising,"This is a redundancy purchase. Amazon was cheating on the ""Frequently Bough Together"" advertising. The Antenna came with a mount kit."
5,Had to Write,"The books in Sharyn McCrumb's Appalachian Series are among my favorites, so I couldn't resist her collection of short stories. All are extremely well written. The stories are so varied that it's hard to believe the same person wrote them all. When I got to the end, I wanted to go back to the beginning and start all over again. The book fits my criterion for Superb; that is, I wish I could have written the stories. Even if you don't ordinarily like short stories, give this book a try."
1,"Very disappointing, don't waste your money!","Usually I love Sharon McCrumb. This book of short stories, however, is a major disappointment. The short story is not is not McCrumb's forte. Short stories should involve the reader quickly and tell a story completely. These have little plot, no character development and end abruptly. They are more like college writing exercises, but because McCrumb is a popular writer the publisher is trying to foist this off on the reader as a collection of polished works. Don't be fooled. There are a lot of McCrumb books out there worth buying, don't waste your money on this one."
4,Stories to go!,"I received this item in a timely manner and it was in good condition. I purchased this item as a gift for my mother, and she was very pleased with it as well."
5,Amazing!,"Okay, I bought this DVD for the Schnittke piece only. Hard to find a performance of his work on DVD or video. This is incredible! Schnittke's viola concerto is one of my favorite pieces and I have many recordings of it. I think this is the best rendition I have ever heard. Bashmet is simply amazing! The sound quality is excellent. I will probably watch the other two pieces eventually but who knows. If you are into Schnittke, you NEED this!"
5,must have,These sights are an absolute must have for low light shooting and are a must have for any self defense pistol. I got the orange rear and green front sight. The distinct front sight color allows you to VERY quickly acquire your front sight in low light conditions. I wouldn't own a pistol without these!
3,Decent sights,"My factory Glock 27 sights had a dimple to tap to remove. These do not. Also, the green is very bright, focus front sight, i get it. The orange is just reallllly dim though. Only other sights i have to compare to are trijicon that have been on my 92 FS since 97' and the are very bright green still. Decent sights good price point. I would recommend them but only 3 stars because i am not sure if the more expensive sights would be that much better."
3,Not Bad,The information does seem a little dated and does not cover all of the styles. It seems a little too brief for the price. If you don't know how to read music and want to learn ... keep looking.
5,It doesn't get better than this!,"This is a tale of a man's dreams and his life's journey in a Greek village. A story you will devour while you fall in love with Greece. It possesses the rare magic of cultural accuracy, abundant warmth and real understanding of the Greek culture, past and present. It touches your heart with characters you will not soon forget. Profound and superbly imaginative, this book captures the spirit of Greeks and their love for life. Take it from a real Greek, this is not one to pass by. Bravo, John Mole! Well done!"
4,Barbarians Fix the Gates,"Yet another book about doing up a ruin on the Mediterranean? what makes this one different is that it is very funny. The humor comes mainly from peculiar foreigners but in this case the foreigners are the Brits who descend on a little village on a Greek island. An easy read, great stories and full of laughter."
5,"Excellent writing, a fine eye for detail, and very witty!","Mole is an excellent writer with a fine eye for detail and a very nice sense of humor. His observations capture the essence of Greek village culture with very funny descriptions of the locals, and particularly their conversations. He keys in on the rampant individuality of the Greeks in a warm-hearted way. He is really good at writing dialogue, athough with the normal problem of trying to convey Greeks speaking broken English and Anglos speaking very broken Greek. But he does manage to pull it off! A light-hearted, funny journey through Greek village life!Reviewed by David Lundberg, author ofOlympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece"
3,"Okay, but not all light-hearted fun, you have to skip the tiresome parts!","I liked parts of this book and disliked others, overall I'm glad I read it, but I didn't find it as funny as other reviews indicated. Its fascinating to hear about Mole's experiences whilst renovating a greek home, I loved his interactions with the villagers and there are some really funny stories. I did not like how Mole tends to go on about Greek Mythology and History. This book is marketed as a funny life experience and that was what I wanted to read. I did not want to be lectured at the same time and found that I skipped many pages because of that. I loved reading about his experiences, not the lectures on Ancient Greece, thanks, already been there and done that, if you know what I mean!"
1,Wasted my money,"Just about every page bulges with the ""to be"" verb, making the reading dull and monotonous. Sentences are unnecessarily packed with useless wording when simpler constructions would be far more clear. I can't imagine this book was edited by a professional. Simple grammar is incorrect in places. I got as far as the fourth chapter and gave the book away."
1,Can't purchase book,"The price of this 2006 book is $16.00 for the Kindle. Paperback is only $10. That's too much for the Kindle version and that's the only way I read. This is really a note to the publisher/author, and not a review of the book, which I would like to read.UPDATE: I see that the Kindle version is now the same price as the paperback - $10.88. Kudos to someone for listening. When it is $9.99 or less, I can buy it."
1,Ok........,This book is a waste of money. She talks about stuff that people should already know. There wasn't very many spells in this book either.
3,a fun afternoon,"I enjoy reading ""true account"" ghost stories and would enjoy writing fictional accounts somewhat in the style of Holzer. When I ran across several books by Dan Asfar, I decided to read three of them to give me some ideas.Haunted Highways(as also Ghost Stories of the Civil War, and Ghost Stories of the Old West) is in the style of recent TV series on haunting and the paranormal. They are short, often second or third hand, and often very vague. Many are more in the nature of folk tales, round-the-campfire-ghost stories, or urban legends. Several of the latter type are stories that I have read in other anthologies, the ghost of Resurrection Mary, being a case in point.In general Mr. Asfar has a good narrative style, although he does occasionally stoop to pure sentimentality, as he does in this book in Emily's Bridge. Although I doubt that anyone reading them will feel any great apprehension, Mr. Asfar's tales do make for a fun afternoon."
5,A winner for the whole family,"I have been using this for my face for over 10 years. It is very inexpensive (especially compared to other cosmetic brands) and cleans well without irritating or drying the skin. I also used it on my 3 kids. It comes in handy on the changing table, especially when the wipes were not quite ""wet"" enough to do the job! It is also great for any spot cleaning anywhere on the body without rinsing. It can just be wiped off without leaving any residue. It is very gentle, even for newborn's skin."
5,Simple and Gently effective - and NOT expensive!,"I try to simplify my life. This product removes makeup and gently cleanses without ever feeling harsh. In a pinch, I have cleansed, removed with a warm wet washcloth, and fell into bed without further ado - and no morning repercussions! Skin is soft and smooth, but never causes irritation or breakouts. No fussing with caps: 2-3 pumps do the job.This always makes beauty magazines ""top products"" lists because it's effective. No, it doesn't have extra ingredients or magical potions, but why would you wash that stuff down the drain anyway? Save your $ for treatments & proper protection! Absolutely gentle enough to use on a baby with any problem skin issues - bathing, etc. Fragrance free.Works off everything but the MOST stubborn waterproof eye makeup. Even then, a little extra & you are fine. Great as an all purpose cleanser/makeup remover for travel."
3,USE OF PRODUCT,"I HAVE NOT HAD TO USE THE PRODUCT FOR LICE, AS I GOT THEM UNDER CONTROL. I HOPE I WILLNOT HAVE TO USE IT FOR THAT CONDITION, BUT WILL TRY TO USE IT FOR CLEANSING"
3,Gentle cleanser but contains paraben,"It's a good cleanser if you are not wearing makeup, it doesn't really completely remove makeup or dirt. Great for morning cleansing though.This product contains paraben, which can clog pores and cause breakout. But if you wash off the cleanser, instead of just wiping it on your face like the instructions say, I think it will be fine.I like this product just fine, but it cannot hold a candle compare to my goat's milk soap."
4,"In the style of What's Up,Tiger Lilly?? comes..........","If you like What's Up,Tiger Lilly? and MST3K,then I'm pretty sure you'll love this!It's dubbed by some comedy troupe and an uncredited Jay Leno and it's very funny!Also,it's raunchy,too,so it's not for the kiddies!!..It's too bad they couldn't include the orginal version on the same disc to give you an idea of what the dialogue is like,but I guess you'd have to buy it to see....Very funny!...."
1,Hopelessly bad and not in a good way.,"Unfunny camp? Bad movies are fun, but (for me) not when they strain to be bad. The original film without the deliberately comical dubbing is funnier. On the other hand, comedy is a very subjective thing and this just may be your cup of tea."
1,The quality of mercy is not strained,"Portia:The quality of mercy is not strain'd,It droppeth as the gentle rain from heavenUpon the place beneath. It is twice blest:It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.The Merchant Of Venice Act 4, scene 1, 180-187For a connoisseur of such films as ""What's Up, Tiger Lily?"" (1966) you may be a tad disappointed as they had to add scenes and run the film backwards to get the effect they needed to match the dialog.The basic story is of a suntan lotion that went awry. The film is chock full of cheap secondary sexual innuendos.Based on a ""scale"" of 1 to 5 I would give this a one.There are a few positives to note:Jay Leno is the voice of Ishmael Pivnik the Sun Demon.Original title ""What's Up, Hideous Sun Demon"" (1983)Re-titled ""Revenge of the Sun Demon"" (1989)Googy Gress a versatile actor plays Chet.See him again in ""Vibes"" (1988) with Cyndi Lauper."
2,A bit weak,"I liked the story told in this book. About a female laird (a woman warrior) who forced a Scottish knight into marriage to stop the war between their 2 clans.I disliked that the knight in some parts of the story has been described as an idot, who doesn't have any pride our own will. To me he was not the character of a real Scottish Highlander.The woman on the other hand appeared sometimes very strong and brave and then again very weak."
5,A Great Set of Wheels!!,"I bought this chair as a gift for my sister, and asked her to give a review. Here is what she said: The wheelchair is great! I received it within several days of ordering it. It is completely assembled, so the only effort you expend is opening the box. I ordered the 18"" after reading the reviews. Depending how you are going to use it may determine what size is appropriate for you. I wanted to make sure when using it in a store, where turning corners and areas may be tight, that I would be able to navigate my way through without too much hassle. I am also very thin, so the seat width was not as important to me. The construction is very substantial for being light weight. The people who have pushed me have all commented how easy it is to maneuver. And to put it away, all you do is pull up on the seat and it's ready to put into the trunk or back seat. Happy Traveling!"
5,Love the wheelchair,It is very well made and comfortable..and a really good price.Would recommend it for anyone needing a good wheelchair. buy before they are gone.
3,"Okay chair, arm rests are a problem","My husband has had his chair for 18 months. The screws that hold the arm rests on won't stay tight despite the use of screw glue. The screws are located in a position that is very difficult to reach. In addition, after less than two years, the material on the arm rests is shredding. We have to keep a Phillips screw driver and duct tape in the wheelchair bag to keep the chair functional."
5,in love,"I LOVE this product! I am obsessed with watching horders, and the length of these is amazing!! ive had it for a while now, like a few months, but i am still watching it all. I love it! great buy! thank you!"
4,great show but incomplete,"Love this show but the crew is only given 2 days to clear the houses and every job is left with more work to be done. Also, to round out the story there should be a follow up interview and tour with each participant, even if it is only a week post clean-up."
2,A little goes a long way.,"I watched a few episodes and that was enough. It made me want to get up and clean my house (I'll bet I'm not the only one affected this way). The first time you see some of these hideously filthy, beyond-cluttered houses it's shocking. Then it's just repetitious and gross. I got through four episodes and threw in the towel. Point made. Enough."
2,Very disappointing,"I agree Elizabeth McGovern was a suitable Snow White, but the story is so different from the Disney version that it should not be called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The wicked queen certainly did not look like a wicked witch. Very poor casting. The dwarfs were ill-mannered and contentious, and we missed not hearing ""Hi, Ho"". In other words, we were very disappointed in this version."
2,Review of Axe nose ring,"Review of axe nose ring: Overall I did not like this product.Pros:Made of silver as advertised.shipped promptly by vendor.Good detail, and antique finish.Cons:Weak construction, lost unit because it would not hold its shape.Cuff and bead finish very rough, very hard on the inside of nose.Stem needs to be longer and extend up the back side of the unit to the axe head.Bead needs to be mounted the other way to help secure it when adjusted. Stem needs to be heavier with better attachement to axe, this is where it broke."
1,Worst Order EVER!,"This was the worst way to spend $75 in my life. I get the DVDs and i get all excited, pop them in the dvd player.......NONE OF THEM WORK! I tried every DVD player in my house. NONE OF THEM WORK! I WANT MY FREAKIN MONEY BACK! THIS IS UNCALLED FOR! THERE WAS NO WARNING THAT IT WOULDNT WORK ON CERTAIN DVD PLAYERS OR ANYTHING. DO NOT ORDER! DO NOT ORDER! DO NOT ORDER!I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND I WANT A COPY THAT WORKS! WORST ORDER EVER!!!!!"
5,An Optimal Textbook,"This book is for students and professionals who wish to analyze optimal multi-input, multi-output feedback control systems. Robustness, performance analysis and disturbance rejection characteristics are presented in a logical framework of developing effective design techniques. Dr. Burl expertly combines rigorous theoretical development with practical and useful examples. The computer simulation exercises are especially challenging, promoting deeper understanding."
2,not vey useful for teaching,"This text is definitly not a good text for class. It skips many steps and makes you wonder where all the results are coming from. Don't recommend for first graduate book on multivariable control. But if you already have a Ph.D, then this can be a good refernce book."
2,"Useless, for the purpose most people might have in consulting it","Someone was looking for the ""Celtic"" symbols of a couple of concepts, and dipping into this tome was a waste of time. The illustrations are meager and have no genuinely illustrative value, just decorations:[Earth] no symbol depicted, in anyone's system,[Cornucopia] no symbol depicted, in anyone's system,[Ginseng] no picture[Fasces] no picture[Fools and folly] no picture,and so on. This is, in fact, a dictionary of mythology (in a way). Most people looking for symbols are looking to get a tattoo, and want to make sure that the graphic doo-dad they're about to have graven into their --- doesn't mean something OTHER than what they mean it to mean.Well, at least you can just make something up and argue about it. You can't do that with Chinese characters. Meanings too definite, and too many people know what they mean. Stick to something woozy, used by people long dead."
4,Kathy Smith-a great aerobic instructor,"I have really enjoyed Kathy Smith's tapes. This one is included in my collection and I have to say it is an instant work-out! The toning tape is a good challenge and gives pretty good results. The aerobic portion is fun, kinda zany and doesn't get to boring. There are a few traditional moves, like the grapevine with other funky ones added in, like the ""running man"". It also allows for some freedom in sections that you are bound to enjoy. The stretching portion leaves you feeling relaxed and free. Each section is made up of its own individual 20 minute mini workout. Different music and settings help alleviate boredom. All in all, I would suggest you add it to your collection, especially for the price. Great if you are on the go and have minimal time in your busy schedule to get in shape. Also good if you feel like taking a long work out with lots of variation."
4,Great for a stretch tape,"I find the toning and aerobic portions too dated and a waste of time, so I only keep this video for the stretching portion only. I will admit, that I'll do the toning portion, if short on time, but it is basically a lower body focused workout. You can get some shoulder work in, doing the advanced modifications, but the biceps & triceps are neglected. Now the stretching portion makes the purchase of this video worth it alone! You start out doing a few rythmic movements to get your blood flowing and loosen up the back & upper body. This part feels great. Then an all over body stretch. There is some soothing music, and Kathy's voice is very relaxing. Not only do you stretch your major muscle groups, you stretch your back and neck as well. My back & neck feel so good after this video! I highly recommend getting this for the stretching portion alone."
2,Toning Segment Inadequate,"The aerobic and stretching parts of this video are fine, but the toning segment is not. The abs section is good, and there is a fairly thorough leg section. However, the stretches within the toning portion are extremely rushed, and she moves from exercise to exercise so fast that the people onscreen are already finished a few reps by the time I've figured out which exercise they are doing.Also, she seems to think that push-ups are the ONLY upper body exercise you need, along with a very short and perfunctory lat portion - I had to do my own shoulder, bicep, tricep work with dumbells after I finished - this is NOT the tape to choose if you really want to work your arms.There are some confusing cuts and editing, cheesy, dated music, and some odd camera angles (i.e., a view of the bottom of an exerciser's foot while she's doing leg extensions).Be forewarned that the box copy about it being a thorough workout is exaggerated, and be prepared to add on some of your own arm work."
1,ZERO,"I was sent a video cassette that does not work. It does not play, rewind or forward. This seller knows this!!!! I believe the name is Honeville or Honeyville. Watch out buyers!!!!"
3,Some nudity...,"Not a great skin flick, but there is some nudity in it. mrskin.com reviews this movie for skin content...."
5,Fantastic,Many practice exams make this book a plus for those who really want to be prepared for any of the five different citizenship exams. You will not be caught off guard and I will use it for teaching my students.
3,Cliff test for Citizenship,Didn't book was from 2005. Some information is outdated.Let you know in the future how well the info. worked
3,Not Bad,"I stayed interested enough in this book to finish it. However, it isn't a book I would save for a later reading like I do with some of my ""keepers"". It was a little hard to keep track of all the different characters. The book wasn't bad; it did keep me reading. I have to say though that a lot of the dialogue seemed excessive, childish and unreal, as if everyone were just thinking out loud. Many of the characters weren't developed enough for me to fully comprehend what they were really like."
2,Far fetched in some parts,"Albeit you'd never get into the book's story it'll keep you reading. But if for one person's whim can be a blackout and keep Vegas without water, I think that the State of Nevada has a very BIG problem as well as the whole country. If one simple woman thinks that she can do whatever she wants to Las Vegas's mob and get away with it... as it happened in the book... I think I better read Cinderella. It's more plausible."
1,No Secrets in here!,"I was sooo dissapointed in this anthology! I had such hig hopes, I had been looking to buy it for years when I found it used on Amazon. But its very boring, with old ""classic"" stories from as far back as Lovecraft. I'm tossing this one! I don't reccomend this at all."
1,"Junky construction, Poor quality","We ordered about ten of these for the office because they looked great and we liked the idea of having a single purchase for inboxes and dry erase boards for outside the cubicles.We're sending them all back. Dry erase boards should not require one to scrub off a message written in dry erase marker for several minutes with maximum force, but that's just what is necessary with these stinkers. One wonders if the manufacturer ever even tried it out themselves.You'll be tempted to order this because it looks nice and useful, but if you do you'll quickly realize what I'm saying in this review. Don't waste your time on this junk. In fact, avoid Quartet products if this is any indication of the quality you can expect from them."
2,"BILL, BILL, BILL...GET REAL!","You are no more than an ALARM without batteries. And that's a good thing, Bill. Your cloud is dark, but not too dark to see through. Fix yourself, then FIX the rest of the world. Robert Appleton, Jr."
5,Vanish,"This book was right up there with the rest of the series that she has written I love the character Jane , It is like it left off where the last book was written. If you enjoyed the other books of this series (the surgeon, body double) you will throughly enjoy this one. It keeps you guessing right up to the end..THis is a book that i would read again just for the thrill of it..and i am sure that you will also"
1,Save your money,"I have read a lot of mysteries, many not great, but this one has to be one of the most boring, unsatisfying ones to come along. The plot, which could have provided some interest, often got lost as she tried to show family dynamics, and the ending, as others have said, was unfounded and anticlimactic. If this were a TV show, you'd turn it off after the first 20 minutes so save your money,"
1,Pack It In?,"A thriller that needs two separate, unconnected plots to fill out its pages is missing something. Interest, I'd say.And, while one plot ends in a bloodbath, the other ends, not with a bang, but an inconclusive whimper.Buried treasure? Mysterious gases? Implausible motives? Handwaving explanations of the improbable? Paper-thin villains with superhuman luck, but not quite good enough aim? Stilted dialogue? A pissing toy poodle?I finished this piece of dreck (at 5 a.m. I sleep poorly, and it was finish the book or commit suicide), but if I can discourage even one reader, there is another star in my crown in heaven."
5,A good read,"I'm enjoying all of the books in this FBI series. Although each book is a stand-alone, I do recommend reading them in order. There are recuring characters and interwoven relationships that you understand and enjoy more reading in order. I like that she continues her trend of having two seperate storylines going on within the one book. Almost like 2 books in one that way :)"
2,Poor. Very poor,"This is my first book by Catherine Coulter. After numerous attempts, finally I finished this book few days ago and all I can think of is a half day of my life wasted for this book. I read a lot and I've had my own share of good books and bad books, but none of them made me so compelled to write a warning to other possible victims. I live in Loudoun Country which is frequently mentioned in the book and I could give her a favorable review for that, but no way. If you want to enjoy a high quality thriller, stay away from this book."
3,Savich and Sherlock are such a great couple!,"This story opens with a bang with a very suspenseful scene in a cave. The book is a little long for the story, I thought, but it was worth the read. I really enjoyed the characters and the interactions among them all.Overall, I have to say I enjoyed this one. It was my first Coulter book, but it definitely won't be my last. Other reviews seem to agree her other FBI thrillers are better than this one, so I can hardly wait to get to the next one."
4,Point Blank,"I just finished Point Blank and read some of the reviews. I might agree this one isn't the best of the FBI Series but wasn't that bad. I might have been disappointed in the ending if I didn't know Dix and Ruth's story continues in ""Double Take"". Dix will finally find out what happened to his wife. I can see why MS COulter didn't pursue the romance too far of Dix and Ruth because legally he is still married I suppose since the mystery of his wife's disappearance has not been solved. I still enjoyed reading ""Point Blank"" because of the 2 mysteries. This was the first book I had seen Dillion and Sherlock in a disagreement (which would have to be normal for 2 married people working together), so that was a different aspect than we had seen before. I liked that Quillan, Dane Carver, and also Ben were mentioned in this book. I always find something postive I like about a book. To me it was worth reading as part of the series."
2,Boring Blah Blah Blah,"Extremely disappointed in this book; my first time with a Catherine Coulter novel has been a lukewarm experience at best. The characters' dialogue seems to stagger along without much meaning, and it appears the education level (and mannerisms) of the majority of the characters--including the FBI Agents--is below normal. I'm halfway through and have decided to toss this book into the ""Give to Good Will"" pile."
2,Disappointing,It seems to me that this author had only two good novels: Hemlock Bay and Riptide. The rest of them lack character depth and even a decent plot. The writing is rudimentary. There are better authors out there.
1,no pay off,"After investing hours reading the most unromantic romantic suspense, Ms. Coulter failed to deliver an even remoting interesting ending. There was no reward for our investment. There was no sense of satisfaction that the mystery was solved, and at least one storyline(Christie's disappearance) was completed ignored. What a complete waste of time. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library."
2,Ridiculous Dialogue,"I read ""Blowout"" on others' enthusiastic recommendations of Catherine Coulter, but ""one and done"" as far as I'm concerned. The plotting is as satisfactory as that of any other of the popular mystery writers, but her characters' dialogue is laughably bad! I can't remember such wooden, fake-sounding speech since books written for middle-school children. It's just hard to take the story itself seriously after the off-putting speech."
3,disappointed,"I have read all of the FBI series and enjoyed every one. When this one ended, all I could say was ""blech!""The characters were good; the separate story lines were good; the ending was really disappointing. I wanted much more."
2,Glad I got the Paper Back,I have read all the FBI books and I loved them all. All I can say about this one is I'm glad I got the paper back. This book took me a month to read I had to force myself to finish it. I just hope the next one is better or I'll be crossing her off my list.
1,If you like real suspense look elsewhere.,"FBI Thriller? Not in your wildest of dreams. This book should have been entitled: ""A Day in the Life of the Waltons."" I'm sure real FBI agents spend time bonding with a cop's family and leaky dog while trying to solve a crime. The characters of the two sons were closer to pre-schoolers. The only suspense was how long before I quit reading the book. I never did finish it."
2,WHERE'S THE POINT?,"I trudged thru this book. I liked the earlier Savich and Sherlocks adventures. I like Dix, Ruth, the boys and Brewster, but just couldnt get locked into the two stories portrayed here.And what's with Dix's wife? No solution or conclusion there. Maybe it is being saved for the next book.Ms Coulter is not my favorite mystery writer. I doubt if I want to spend the time to read another one."
2,Point Blank,"Ending was an anti-climax. No twist, ended very blunt as if there should be a follow on. The disappearance of the wife was mentioned regularly for at least the first 70% of the book, then nothing."
2,Thank Goodness!,"Thank goodness I bought this book at a library book sale. I believe Ms. Coulter got her manuscripts mixed up when she sent this book to the publisher. I thought I was reading two, possibly three, separate stories. Although I haven't finished reading it, I gave the book two stars in hope that it will improve. After reading other reviews, that seems doubtful."
1,Time Better Spent Elsewhere,First and last time reader of this author. Opening was somewhat effective but followed by unrealistic situations and unbelieveable dialogue. Very little suspense and an unresolved ending. Back to Daniel Silva for me!
3,Interesting murder mystery,I bought the unabridged audio version of Point Blank and gave it 3 stars because I thought it was a pretty good thriller and I liked the characters. I took 2 stars away because this book was in the romance catagory and there was no romance to speak of! This is my first Catherine Coulter novel so I will take the advise of another reviewer and try one of her earlier works.
4,"Good action, strong storyline","Catherine Coulter is constantly growing as a writer. Her F.B.I. series is excellent. Having Savich & Sherlock as the connecting thread creates an almost ""family"" feeling about these books. The stories are never common but always fast-paced and with great twists. Happily she uses restraint and only hints at the action during the love scenes, which I find very refreshing. If you want a good ""read' she is the author for you."
2,"This ""Maze"" is not worth wandering through","Having read all of the Savitch and Sherlock series I was truly looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the revenge and murder plotline as well as the poorly drawn characters. If you are a first time reader of Cathering Coulter, I would advise you to read the early Savitch/Sherlock books such as ""The Maze"", ""The Edge"" and ""The Target"". They are exciting, well plotted stories that are well worth the time you will invest reading them."
2,Boring and long-winded,"When I got half way through this novel I asked myself: ""Why am I reading this?"" It's isn't very interesting. For the first time I can recall I fell asleep midday while reading this book.If a good editor had slashed the manuscript by 50% it might be more readable. My recommendation: Give it a pass."
5,Handy and small,"Nice gauge to keep in the vehicle for routine tire checks. Accurate, light and easy to use. Stores easily out of the way and seems to be withing acceptable accuracy limits. Shipped fast and arrived ready to use. So far even my wife checks the tires occassionally, but I don't look for this trend to continue. Fast shipment and simple out of the box use. Good price and good product."
1,Digital Tire Gauge,"I received this item with the battery almost drained out. So I was wondering if this is normal ?? of course not!! The operation is afected by the low power and it is inaccurate. After I replaced the battery it is still not working appropiately. I don't recommend it, and I disagree with the comments that put this device as a good one giving five stars."
1,cheap digital tire gauge,"it does not work. It is made cheap, but Custom Accessories will not let me return it.Not very happy."
4,A must have for old school hip hop fans!!!,A good mix of some of the best hip hop you should be listening to!!!
1,Yum!,"I gave this book to my twin granddaughters. They are learning to read, and they enjoy the humorand plots by the young twin boys, and relate them to situations like their own."
2,Ending Rapidly Deteriorates,"I loved the first 2/3 to 3/4 of the book, but by the end I just wanted to throw it against the wall.A novel, or set of novels, must be consistent and logical in flow for the reader, and they must play fair by the reader. It doesn't matter what those rules are so much as that they are present. Haldeman introduces new plot elements in at the end that have zero relationship to anything preceding, one of which was used to explain something that exists only as a plot device, and one thrown in for no reason whatsoever other than that he appeared to have been watching Star Trek before sitting down to type.I loved Forever War through the first 2/3 of this book, but loathed the end. Just stop reading it as soon as unexplainable things start occurring, and imagine your own ending."
1,The ending really disappoints,"I loved Forever War and really liked Forever Peace. Forever Free is a terrible successor. Starts off great, then collapses (in the last 20 pages!) into a real Deus ex Machina the ancient Greeks would have been ashamed of. I think Haldeman reached the three-quarters point, got distracted, and just tied everything up as quickly as possible. Considering what he could have accomplished with this, it's even more disappointing."
2,Should have been better,"This was disappointing on several levels. Haldeman could have done so much more with this story and sequel than he did. It was an interesting story. But, it could have been any character and not William Mandella et al. Also, where did the Omni come from and why was it necessary to introduce them in the last parts of the story? It added very little to the plot and we could have done with out it/him/she/whatever. I borrowed the book from my local library. I would have felt much worse had I actually paid good money for it."
1,Weak ending to an average series,"Though I remember the avid engagement in which the other books in the series held me, I am disappointed by this book. It is simply unconvincing in the way it lays the foundation for the revelation at the end of the story - quite frankly, there is very little meat to the storyline and I found the plot unconvincing and contrived. This seem to be an excuse to milk the fans hooked on the series and anyone looking for a good read will be sorely disappointed. The lukewarm interactions and unconvincing dialogue had me flipping pages in a hurry to find a reason for buying the book.For example, the group consciousness concept is pretty nifty but it is poorly explored. The Omni species was decidedly irrelevant to the story and the manner in which the true nature of human existence is revealed is simply bogus. I suppose this book is adequate for those who don't know any better, but if you're looking for a real SF epic, look elsewhere."
2,A Real Disappointment,"Wow, this one was a real disappointment. After having read, and greatly enjoyed, 'Forever War' and 'Forever Peace', I was anxious to read this book. 'Forever Free', however, failed to live up to expectations. It lacked any of the impact of the previous two books and failed to generate any thought provoking questions. The book started off slowly, but there was a sense that something really interesting was going to happen. At about the point that the interesting stuff should have happened, the story simply sputtered out to a really disappointing conclusion. Suffice it to say the end was incredibly simplistic and really didn't seem to relate to the rest of the story. It seems as though Haldeman either grew bored with the story and decided to wrap it up in a simple, ""Star Trek""-esque mysterious omniscient aliens manner or he decided that he really wanted to write a different story. Either way, this was a real disappointment."
1,"Surprisingly, not even worth it","This is not a worthy successor to The Forever War. While Haldeman's style is in top form, his ideas are not. Even the favorable reviews concede that Forever Free has none of the impact of the original Forever War. What we have here is a forced novel springing from a half-formed idea that would have been better as a mediocre Twilight Zone episode.Over the past few year I've been reading most of Haldeman's works. While not all of them are treasures, almost all of them are worth reading. Usually even his worst books have something unique to offer that you can't find anywhere else. Unfortunately his newer work is not up to par, and this novel is not even worth a read.I would highly suggest Forever Peace. While not a true sequel in the sense of plot or setting, it is really the logical successor to The Forever War in terms of ideas."
2,Wouldn't recommend this book if it was Forever Free (haha),"I don't agree with the reviewer who said this would surpass Forever War as Haldeman's best novel. I found it to be relatively weak compared to both earlier ""Forever"" works (even considering that Forever Peace was not related to either War or Free).Many of the characters lacked the definition required to be unique or contribute substantially to the story line. Some scenes seemed ridiculously out of place when put in the context of the universe Haldeman has created. And of course, many reviewers have pointed out that the ending ""plain old stinks"". It's an abrupt shift from a mediocre quest of discovery to an eigth grader's sci-fi fantasy finale at the last possible minute and impossible to take seriously.If you've read Haldeman's other works, then this should be on your list only if you must read them all to satisify your Forever Lust. Otherwise, skip it.If you've never read Haldeman, drop what you're doing and order Forever War right now!"
1,Horrible. Save your money,"What happened? The Forever War was so good! This was dullness punctuated by the mundane, with no suspense and a cheesy neat wrap up in the last few pages. I kept hoping things would take off, so I kept reading, and as I started to near the end, I realized I'd wasted a whole lot of time."
1,Thoughts on Forever Free,I really didn't like Forever Free. I thought the plot was ridiculous and didn't live up to the first book.
2,I loved the first two and this one broke my heart.,"The first book, ""The Forever War"" was great. The second, ""Forever Peace"" was almost as great. This one was terrible. It started out fine as a sequel to both the first and second even though they weren't related to each other. The ending was a disaster, and my secret hope is that it was tacked on by someone other than Haldeman. You know those endings where the main character wakes up and realizes everything that happened was a dream? That's not what happened, but what did happen was equally unsatisfying."
3,"Interesting Premise, but Loses Steam","_Forever Free_ begins promisingly: The veterans who survived the _Forever War_ find themselves unable to fit into a peaceful, but thoroughly alien culture. They try to escape their situation by skipping history for a few thousand years.So far so good, and maybe it's a good idea that the author doesn't let them succeed in this project -I don't blame him for having no clear idea what sort of society the time travelers would find on their return, and even a well executed novel along these lines would appear to be overly derivative of _The Forever War_.The alternative that Haldeman offers, however - literally a ""deus ex machina"" - was pretty unsatisfactory and ultimately left me disappointed in the book."
1,Ugh,"Reading this was like taking a spaceship to Bizarro World and reading their version of The Forever War -- in every way that War was excellent, Peace is terrible. To think I was excited to find a hardcover version."
1,What a disappointment!,"This book does not deserve to be by the same author and in the same series as ""Forever War""It feels like the author was in a rush to get this to the market. Many story lines are underdeveloped and unfinished.Is it really by the same person who wrote ""Forever War"" and ""Forever Peace""?Overall this is NOT a book to read."
1,Free of Ideas,"Where do you go from up? This seems to be Haldeman's problem. After the astonishing ""The Forever War,"" what do you do for a follow-up?""Mind Bridge"" was wonderful. ""Forever Peace"" was disappointing. ""The Hemmingway Hoax"" was incoherent (how did it win any awards?) And now we have ""Forever Free,"" which commits the unforgivable sin of grabbing the reader's attention, and then insulting him with an idiotic and just plain lazy ending. It seems a safe bet that this book was written on an advance from the publisher to a deadline, and Mr. Haldeman just plain ran out of ideas as the deadline approached.The story starts well and sets-up some interesting plot lines and puzzles, but using ""a wild and crazy G-d!"" to wrap-up the story is maddeningly cheap and disappointing. And it insults G-d.I will no longer buy a Haldeman book simply on the author's name.woodit@ma.ultarnet.com"
3,If your cat remarked on the cold weather outside...,"...would you offer it tea? Probably not (or at least not until yourheart had remembered to start beating again). But if you were acharacter in this book, you just might.The above is an exaggeration, but the exemplifies what I find most wrong with this book. Characters tend to ""coast"" through the rough (intellectual/emotional) spots, or else their reactions are cut short with a quick fade. This tendency approaches silliness by the end of the book....It might be worth a read but the two previous ""Forever"" books are much better. END"
3,Great writing trapped in a fragmented plot,"Haldeman's Forever War and Forever Peace solidified my taste for his writing style, so I was looking forward to Forever Free. While plot has never been his greatest strength, the first two novels managed to string together a series of well described scenes into an overall context. In Forever Free the scenes are there, but the connection is either confused or at times so strained as to be ridiculous. If you love his writing and characters, there is still some of that here, just don't go looking for clean story-line."
1,Horrible!,"This book is not a good read. Everything about it is horrible. Haldeman wrote all these really cool books and then he wrote this? The story was just sloppily thrown together and threatens to undo what was so good about The Forever War. I didn't feel like I was reading about the same two people. I thought there was this deep love connection between Mandella and Marygay and that her having waited for him all that time was so sweet and romantic...Then to ruin it with this Cat lady, that was the person that she really loved but decided she wasn't able to wait for...I just started really disliking the book from that point and my opinion of it never improved."
2,Frank Herbert did this better,"And in fewer words, in his short story ""Rat Race"", which you can find in his collection /Eye/. Skip it unless you're a huge Forever War fan."
2,What the...?,I'm a Joe Haldeman fan. I think Forever War is one the greatest science-fiction books ever written. Both Forever War and Forever Peace where great stories which offered interesting views of humanity.Forever Free was just a Twilight Zone episode. I wish I had never read it.
2,Forever Free of What?,"I can't find a reason that Mr Haldeman would choose to revisit the characters of his classic ""The Forever War"" except that it must have been easier to use familiar faces than to create new ones. To think that this is the continuation of the saga the author always dreamed of is a scary thought. Forever Free statrts off well enough as it quickly reaquaints us with old friends. Unfortunatly, as the book progresses all hopes for a thrilling and satisfying conclusion goes out the window as the narrative spins beyond the unlikly and into the absurd. If Mr Haldeman wanted to tell this tale, he should have left William Mandella alone and started with a new crop of characters. This is not the fate they deserve."
1,Deus Ex Machina of doom,"Okay, it's almost a good idea, except that it doesn't make any sense, and what might have been a moderately interesting premise is destroyed byt an embarassingly poor ending. In fact, it's the worst ending of any book I've read in a long long time. It makes Star Trek V look like great art. It's nonsensical and even somewhat insulting. It's just dumb. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Go reread ""The Forever War"" again or something."
2,What the HECK happened to the Forever War?,"I was pleased AT FIRST to find out that Haleman had written a sequel to _The Forever War_. What a disappointment! Great charcacters and dialogue completely wasted on a juvenile, self-indulgent plot. William Mandella deserved better. God is a dweeb in this book, Angels are reduced to Odo and Halemann trivialized his own excellent novel _The Forever War_ (which is justly regarded as a classic.)Some things are better left alone and Haldeman's time and IMMENSE talent would be better spent finding new characters and plots to explore."
1,How could Haldeman do it?,"I saw the book yesterday lunch-time at Sydney airport terminal and had a few hours to fill in. The Forever War is one of my very favourite hard sf books and I couldn,t believe my good fortune in spotting the sequel.ITS AWFUL. Starts off well then descends into soft fairy-tale fantasy. I can't describe how disappointing the book is. I read it straight through in four hours. It really came apart for me when the Time Warp strange events started and was all downhill from there.What about the unnatural origin of MF and its biosphere? Just mentioned and left. What about the derelict civilisation found by the Taurans? Just mentioned and left. What relevance have the Omnis? Go figure.Joe, how could you do this?"
1,The reviewers are right...,"I read The Forever War a few months back, and I loved it. I wondered why I hadn't ever gotten around to reading it before. Then I read Forever Peace and really, really liked it. Not quite 5 stars, but almost. Then when Forever Free came available in paperback, I saw all the negative reviews, and I thought, ""Aw, come on! Must be a bunch of Haldeman haters!"" So I ordered it, and I read it.Ugh.Trust me, the reviewers are right: This is one to avoid. I remember how, when the movie Star Trek 5 came out, my friends and I went to watch it, and afterwards, depressed, we said, ""You know, I'm just going to pretend that one never happened."" That's the way I feel about Forever Free. (And its plot is remarkably similar to Star Trek 5, too.) It felt like Haldeman just wasn't trying. Joe, if you read this: I'm not enraged, I'm just disappointed. Really disappointed. You can do better than that."
3,"Okay, so it became time to END the story...","It is great to see familiar characters from a truly engaging story. Having Marygay and William back, twenty years later ""subjective time,"" well, there's a lot that can be done with that.And Haldeman really appears to enjoy doing it, telling the story of how arriving into this bizarre descendant-of-man culture has affected these people.But then, suddenly, 90% of the way through the book, it seems Haldeman lost his interest and just decided, okay, it's time to end this story and wham! Out of nowhere comes a hard and fast deus ex machina ending. Seriously deus ex machina. Like, the epitome of deus ex machina.It was so disappointing. However, the ride getting there was so much fun. If you just don't bother to read the resolution it would be a 5."
3,Deus Ex Machina,"I recently discovered Forever War which was an incredible feat of writing. Coming from that, I went straight for Forever Free to get the continuity in the story. Even after reading the reviews I understood it would be ""different"".Yes, the way the story develops requires a huge leap of faith on the reader's behalf, and it's not all good. I believe that I now fully understand the meaning of Deus Ex Machina! Even going along with it, too much was thrown in at the end with too little elaboration. This had more potential and feels like it was rushed. Still, I found the story interesting."
2,meh.,"There are times that sequels do not live up to the original, and are just used as a vehicle for the author to tell another story riding on the back of previous success. This is it.Adequeate as SciFi goes, but this and Forever Peace didn't need to be associated with Forever War.(copying review to Forever Peace as it applies there too)"
1,A terrible waste of time. Forget it.,"Awful. Just awful. Haldeman is capable of writing an excellent novel, as evidenced by ""The Forever War"" which is far and away my favorite SF-War novel. This book has nothing to say, but nevertheless manages to say it in an almost incoherent (and completely unentertaining) way. Save your time and money, and look elsewhere."
2,Sigh,"By this point, any opinion I write will probably sound like one of dozens written before. Still, I have to say I didn't like this book. I actually didn't think it was too bad until the end, at which point my suspension of disbelief goes out the window. One of my personal prejudices is that a bad ending can make me dislike an entire book, and that is the case here."
2,"O.K, what happened?","I love Joe Haldeman books I have read all of the books of ""Te Forever War"". But there is not way I can describe this book except this. Think of a mirror and around Pg. 25 that mirror gets shattered into about 100 little bits and chunks. There are plot lines that make no sense, Charecters that make sense and a final resolution(the end of the book) tha makes eve less sense.My Impression-If you have any respect for Joe Haldeman at all, aviod this one."
1,Some things are best left to the imagination...,".... When the publisher/editor(whomever is responsible) goes against the author and names his previous work, the ""Forever Peace"", as the sequel to the ""Forever War"", alarms should automatically sound in one's head. Joe Haldeman, states that the ""Forever Peace"" is NOT a sequel, right there on the cover of said book! They are related only in that both are drawn from his experiences of the Vietnam War. ...."
1,What a waste,"Why did Mr. Haldeman write this book? The only reason I can figure is that his last sorry book, ""Forever Peace"" won some awards so he thought he could make some money by revisiting his best work. Well I wish he could give me my money back. Forever Free is AWFUL. This is what we waited for? The ending of Forever War was so perfect, leaving the lives of the two characters up to the readers imagination. I think anyones imagination could have devised a better ending than the one written here by Haldeman. A 25 year wait just so that Mr. Haldeman can completely destroy this story line with what? Just a bad episode of ""The twilight Zone."" This story is just plain bad, no action, no suspense, none of the caring for the characters that I felt in the first book. I fought off the urge to just throw it away half way through the book, hoping for a payoff in the end...it didn't come. Cant steer folks away from this piece of garbage enough."
2,Also disappointed by the ending,"Many others are disappointed by the ending. The expectation in a science fiction book is that you will see a concept introduced and expounded, hopefully with a few twists, or at least surprises from elements which are otherwise consistent with the world model created in the story.This story just shoves an ending in your face. It's a mystery, but not a solvable puzzle. Something just happens.I enjoyed the previous book, Forever Peace, even though it is ""disjoint"" from the war .. free continuum. Forever Free? Anything but."
4,Hot rod steering wheel,The steering wheel was perfect for my application however the center cap had to be modified to fit correctly. Otherwise it was as advertised.
3,Mediocrity has a new definition.,"If you're looking for generic metalcore with some decent guitar technicality, buy this album. If you're actually looking for good music, buy the self-titled Nodes of Ranvier album. The loss of their former vocalist really took a harsh blow to the band. This album is depressing, really."
2,Unexpected Disapointment,"I bought this album on the strenth of the last - the self titled ""Nodes Of Ranvier"" Album back in 2002. I was really impressed by the level of detail and power that they managed to put into their songs. Nodes were a band who in the world of hardcore sounded really different from the rest and I really could see them going somewhere. This album is the complete opposite, same-same type hardcore stylings, no special indeed. Don't buy this album. I'm not saying that because its really bad which it isn't but I fear it will ruin your image of a band that were by far several cuts above the rest."
5,"Great High Chair, Great Value!","We received this high chair from our registery - although many of my friends said we ""had"" to get the peg perego model, I just didn't see the point in asking family / friends to spend that much on a high chair. Now I'm glad we didn't - we, including our daughter, love this chair. The tray is very easy to take off and clean, the lean-back mechanism is both easy for taking our daughter out or recline for her to take her bottle, and the looks of it (we have a slightly different print than this one) are nice. I would highly recommend as a good value and highly functional."
2,"Should be renamed ""Behind the scenes""","The title is really misleading I thought this would be a video version of the bookPerformance Riding Techniques: The MotoGP manual of track riding skills(which is excellent). There are no real riding secrets revealed here just a glimpse behind the scenes and a little insight into the mental portion of professional riding at this level. If you're an experienced rider, you won't learn anything from this just read the book."
3,moto gp movie,"I expected more from this movie. I'm a track day pilot and know the basics and thought this would have some good ""secrets"" for going faster but its all stuff I have heard before."
4,light for my plants,"I have many large patio plants that I need to bring in for the Wisconsin winter. Due to limited window space, I store some in my basement. The light works well, but I am not sure yet, how my plants will hold up to the test."
4,"Great for ""spot"" plant lighting.","I bought this to give winter light to our schefflera plant. I've had one for several years that winters a ficus tree in our living room. Simple, well-built -- should last many years. However, this product is slightly ""dated."" It is supplied with a specialty incandescent ""plant bulb"" that puts out lots of heat, and moderate light. Much better (IMO) to use a modern CFL BULB to provide better light and lower cost and less heat. I use mine on a timer and give the plant good light every day. The schefflera seems to love it!"
3,"Pretty good, but need some improvements!","I ordered these lights because I love to grow indoor plants but don't get much direct sunlight into my house. I like the fact that they have an on-off switch (rather than being controlled by the plug) and they are very bright and even add some warmth for my plants. However, the blue coating on the lights that is supposed to help simulate sunlight has already started flaking off, less than 2 weeks after my purchase. For $20 a piece, I would expect better quality than that. Fortunately, replacements bulbs can be bought at Wal-mart for $3-4. Overall I would say that these do provide good light and heat for your indoor plants, but they are fairly expensive and lower quality than they should be for the price."
4,Plant Light,The GE 44848 65 Watt Plant Light works great. The price is also very reasonable compared to other plant lights.
4,This calendar is quite popular at my house,"I don't know anything about Annde Geddes. All I know is that thiis calendar is up at my house and people love it. I can't believe all the rave reviews people give it when they see it.The product is simple enought. It's a 12-month calendar with a picture above the month. All of the pictures in this calendar contain a baby dressed in outfit paying tribute to the month. All of the pictures are well taken and I must admit the pictures are quite cute. Some don't do as much for me as others do, but it's not that bad of a calendar.I would never buy this calendar for myself. I would buy it for any woman in my life that loves children and babies and I have. It's a cute calendar that can be enjoyed by all."
5,doris day collection,The CD arrived in perfect condition. It came within the allotted time. The recordings are excellent. I'm delighted with the product and the condition of it. Steve
1,HORRIBLE,"This dvd is the biggest waste of money..... its cool for about?..... 10 min then it just gets annoying and repetitive. I reccomend u do not buy this dvd, TRUST ME"
2,Very Slow,"Could have gotten its message across in half the time. I found that it seemed to go on and on. Kind of too ""real time"" for me."
2,No communication,"there was no communication between the characters. The prents were clueless- come on- that's ridiculous. When the mother went to talk to another child.s mother about her daughter pretending to be a boy, we are shut out of the conversation.The film could have been wonderful but instead it was a dud. shame on the making of such a vapid film. Why are people happy about this film when so much important stuff isn't there?"
5,well acted,"Top notch acting, which is surprising considering most of the actors are children. The director must be good with kids.I don't usually like movies with a theme about homosexuality or gender issues and such because I can't really relate and usually it kind of grosses me out. But this one was really well done. I thought the relationship between the two sisters was really sweet and totally made me flashback to childhood. But Laure was a much nicer big sister than I ever was. But then she had a nicer family so there you go."
4,A small stunner of a film,"Again, thanks to Amazon for pointing me in the direction of this film as I never would have seen the write-up or reviews. I loved this one almost at 5 stars (I'd do 4.5 if I could). The young actress playing the lead of Laure is phenomenal and I expect she'll continue to make herself known as she matures. Also her sister and father were fantastic characters and very well done...showing depth and heart and style. I want to take the younger sister home and just watch her draw :) I found I didn't need the sub-titles most of the time...it was easy to ""get"" what the moments were about. Beautifully filmed and a story that's compelling and timely. My only small complaint was with the mom but perhaps it's how her role was written. Still absolutely worth the rental...no question!"
1,Evaluation copy,"I purchased a full version CD of PCBackUp and received an evaluation CD.Everything was OK, until the time period expired.Then, I discovered that I needed to purchase the full version of PCBackUp.I am not a happy camper, right now."
1,StompSoft PC BackUp V7,I found this product is not as good as V6 it doesn't store Registry Keys and doesn't restore to how it was when it was BackedUp to disk. Not as good at all with version V6 if you lost information all you had to do was restore with V7 you have to look for the restore only that the minimum stars is 1 I would give it 0
1,Stompsoft Cheats on Rebates,"Submitted Rebate which was rejected because I had only included the UPC code but not an inside flap of the box. It was stated once in the submission form but in 2 other areas they only asked for the UPC code.After reading the reviews, I don't have any confidence in the software and will switch to Norton. At least they are a respectable company."
1,Poor Product,"Occassionally crashes for no apparent reason. After every backup completes, a dialog reading ""...completed with errors..."" appears, but no details show up and no error messages appear in the log. It's impossible to find out what the problem is. Very poor."
1,Junk,"Several year ago, I upgraded from v6 to v7.I agree with many of the other comments here - plus I am adding one additional foible: Whenever there is a DVD failure, the old backup jobs cannot be deleted unless you re-install the program.Why can't I give it a zero? Because Amazon forces me to rate the item. :-)"
1,A Piece of Crapola !,"Don't waste your money. This program is a piece of junk. They could not have made a simple back-up more difficult if they tried really, really hard."
1,"Does Amazon have ""none star"" rate?","I agree 100% with ""luvinlife1960 - I should have read actual user reviews."".I did a backup with poor software and I have try do restore it. Nothing work. I open a ticket on website. And nothing answer. I'm astonished with other website have good reviews about this horrible software.SAVE YOUR MONEY !"
2,"received wrong item, twice","I ordered backup by StompSoft, because I had one at home.You sent backup by Migo. I notified you. You sent me another shipment of the same thing, backup by Migo. And told me I would be charged for the second shipment, too, if I didn't return the one by some deadline. I am still evaluating the one to see if it will do, or just not do. I get limited access time at the customers site and backups take a long time and have to run off hours. Backups I get but auto scheduling is not yet working.Rich"
4,StompSoft PC BackUp,"We have been using Backup MY PC for many years, and we recently upgraded to the new PC Backu UP program. The program works well, but the distribution cd is packed in a cardboard holder which compresses the cd side to side and after being in storage before shipping, it gradually bows the cd so it isn't flat. I had to download the program from their website to get it to install. Amazon gladly replaced the cd for us, but the replacement was also bowed. We are presently waiting for a good cd to be shipped to us so we have a proper backup cd for future use."
1,Poor performance,This backup software seems to be quite a bit slower than its predecessor (Backup My PC). It took about 5 times as long to backup the same amount of data when I did a benchmark comparision.
1,I should have read actual user reviews -- DO NOT BUY THIS,"I made the mistake of reading online reviews, but not actual user experiences that were posted here and purchased this software. It takes this software literally DAYS to back up a mere 40 gigs. And other users are correct about Stompsoft's absolute travesty of a customer support system both online and on phone. None of my emails have been answered, and I actually stayed on hold for TWO HOURS and got no answer.It's a shame I can't get my money back. Try Memeo instead."
1,Do NOT buy this product,"I had the older version (Backup MyPC) which worked OK, but was slow. Updated to the new version (free upgrade). Worked for about 1 month, although was also very slow.Now it will not run a backup. Every backup is greated with the error ""Error in NSEngine Module and locks up at that point.There is NO support service. Posted to the website 4 times with no response. Called and was on hold for 1/2 hour. The ""on-hold"" message says to leave a message by pressing *, which does not work.I am searching for a better solution to backing up, but this is not it. One star is generous, because to get one star the program has to actually work.DO NOT BUY!"
1,Don't buy this product -- no support at all,Could not get the product to span disks when I have a lot of files to backup. Submitted tickets online to tech support for a month with NO response. Called corporate office and they said someone would get back to me. Still waiting.
1,Failure,"Tried to make the product work on a Windows XP Professional. It did not work. Tried to call Tech. service= was left on line 20 minutes without help 3 times. Called Better Business Bureau in Irvine CA and found out that company has an ""F"" rating and does NOT respond to.I will stop payment through my credit card.The product locked up both the product AND my computer EVERY time I tried to do a back-up. Even when closing all running programs, even though this is supposed to back up even running programs.STAY AWAY FROM IT.!!!"
4,"If you love Bing Crosby and great love songs, get this one","While Bing Crosby doesn't sing his hits on this CD, he does sing some incredible songs. Bing uses his powerful, magnificent voice to sing terrific numbers such as ""The Very Thought of You,"" ""Temptation,"" and ""Let me Call You Sweetheart."" Once again, if you are a fan of these and the other love standards on this CD, and you know how great the typical Bing Crosby CD is, then you should at least consider getting this one."
2,Uninspired remixes,"What a waste of time & money!The remixes offered here add absolutely nothing; they aren't bad OR good, just DULL!!! Only the final remix has any touch of quality, but it is hardly worth it and is definitely a case of ""too little, too late"". As for the case of the 'bonus' track, ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me': OK performance, but I REALLY hate this song anyway, from its melody to its lyric; it just brings the whole affair to a creeching halt!"
2,EXPECTED MORE FOR MY MONEY,"IMAGE IS VERY MISLEADING. WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED UPON OPENING A BOX OF $20 HOT CHOCOLATE TO FIND AN ITTY BITTY CAN. MABYE ENOUGH FOR A COUPLE OF CUPS. ONLY IF YOU SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE DO YOU FIND THAT ITS ONLY A 12 OZ CONTAINER. IT SHOULD STATE THAT NEXT TO THE PICTURE AND INSANE PRICE. IS THE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE BUT NOT FOR THE PRICE.I FOUND ANOTHER BRAND THAT TASTES JUST AS GOOD, COSTS LESS, AND I GOT 10X AS MUCH."
4,90s,"For whatever reason I feel compelled to share, after downloading a library copy, how strange it is to hear such a mix of timeless and VERY 1990s-sounding tracks. I imagine it would be impossible to truly mix hip hop and elevator music today. Maybe I can blame what the internet has done to porn."
3,"Trip-hop trips up, a little","Massive Attack's first album, BLUE LINES, was an exciting and novel release that offered a range of superb tracks that didn't let the listener down. Four years later, Massive Attack released PROTECTION, and this trip-hop band tripped up a little.PROTECTION nowhere offers the consistency that BLUE LINES did, and many of the songs are rather weak, especially the title track and ""Three."" The last track, a live performance of The Doors' ""Light My Fire"", seems pretty out-of-place.However, there are a couple of great tracks which stop this from being a bad album, the ganja-influenced ""Eurochild"" and ""Karmacoma,"" and the ambient ""Heat Miser."" This songs make the album listenable, but somewhat disappointing all in all.Happily, Massive Attack's next release, 1998's MEZZANINE, is one of the best rock albums ever, and regains the perfection (surpasses it, in fact) of BLUE LINES."
2,"Better things would come with ""Mezzanine""","This overrated album doesn`t do much for me. I don`t really see what`s so special about it, and I believe it`s the band`s worse record. The title song is a good opener, and ""Karmakoma"" is a great moment as well, but after the third track, ""Three"", it all goes downhill and turns into an average and bland trip-hop/ downtempo record. The last song, a cover of ""Light my fire"", is particularly weak and just puts me away.A disappointig and souless album, ""Protection"" is alright as background music, but not much else."
3,princess tracey!,"as usual, i order a cd like 'protection' for a song or two. then i get a great surprise.in this case, it's the title track, with vocals by tracey thorn. thorn, along with lisa gerrard, dusty springfield, doris day, billie holiday, aretha franklin and a few others, has a uniquely gorgeous voice and styling that is immediately identifiable for so many things--a social scene, a certain era, a mood.unlike the others, she has still to get her due and fame as a singer. here's hoping that people will use her and get her heard as much as the law will allow."
4,Title track is great!,"This is a really cool cd. Very mellowed-out, seductive, chilled-out, whatever you want to call the style. A great example of trip-hop/downtempo tunes, especially the title track and ""Heat Miser"" which are my favorites. Recommended."
3,"Good, but not great","I really like most of this CD. I have no real complaints about it except for the title track and another one by the same vocalist. The lyrics are ridiculously boring and simple. It's really painful to listen to.Save for those two tracks, this album is quite good. Like Mezzanine, it's got style, class and talent. Spyglass and Karmacoma are especially good. I gave it 3 stars, but I really think it deserves 3.5."
3,Decent,"This is a decent CD, but not quite as good as Mezzanine. I was hoping for more lyrical goodness from MA, instead I was greated with a lot of instrumental tracks and lackluster vocals. Despite its shortcomings, however, it will be one of my main CD's for quite awhile."
2,"Pretty good, shoulda bought ""Blue Lines"" though","I originally had only ""Mezzaine"" which I thought was a great album so i bought this one next at a music store without reading any reviews at Amazon for it. BIG MISTAKE! I should have saved my money and probably bought""Blue Lines"" from the sounds of it because this CD I think sucks. ""Protection"" though is a really awesome song and i like that one, but the rest don't even come close. I'm not going to throw it away but then again it's not my most listened to album. Buy something else, unless this is your last CD you need of Massive Attack's."
2,"Dull, with a few highlights.","Overall, I found this record too boring to even bother using as background music. Background music doesn't have to be so bland. But there are a few standouts.""Protection"" - Gorgeous song. Not the best opener, but it's great.""Karmacoma"" - Great track with not-so-great lyrics.""Three"", ""Weather Storm"" - Okay, but kindda average and cheesy.""Spying Glass"" - Same as the last 2 but also annoying.""Better Things"" - Starts off incredibly dull but gets a little better, mostly due to Tracy Thorn. Lyrics could be less..dull.""Eurochild"" - Pretty good! Actually ""chill"".""Sly"" - Boring & pretentious.""Heat Miser"" - Boring.""Light My Fire"" - Really horrible cover."
5,A soundtrack for the late 90's,"Released in 1995 and timeless in nature, Massive Attacks's second album provides a cool, hypnotic soundtrack for the late 90's. The guys from Bristol have melded an album that grows with repeated listenings and reveals new sounds and nuances every time it is played. The title song, with the divine Tracey Thorn on vocals, is jazzy, cool and hypnotic. It is physical but does not neglect the cerebral. Using vocalists such as Nicolette and Horace Andy the album weaves it's way into the subconsciousness and stays with you long after it is off the turntable. Heat Miser, Three and Karmacoma are three other stand out tracks with the only jarring inclusion being the live cover of Light My Fire. More mature than Blue Lines and a perfect transition into Mezzanine. One of the best albums you will ever here."
5,"Underrated Gem, Tracey rules!","This is Massive Attack's sophomore album, released in 1995 after their highly acclaimed debut, 1991's Blue Lines. Although overshadowed by both its predecessor and 1998's Mezzanine, this album is just as good as both of them. Tracey Thorn and Nicolette are arguably the best guest vocalists they used on any of their albums, maybe even a little bit better than Shara Nelson or Liz Fraser. Not breaking new ground like their debut, or pure darkness like their third LP, but still worth the money. Best tracks are the title track, ""Sly"", and ""Spying Glass""."
4,I'm surprised that this album is so underated.,"A lot of people prefer blue lines over protection and I just don't understand that. I found protection to be great. Possibly one of the best CDs that Massive attack has ever released other than Mezzanine. Eurochild is mindblowingly amazing. Karmacoma, Better things, Heat Miser, weather storm and spying glass are also exceptional. The only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is cause of the last track. A cover of the Doors, Light my fire that, to me, seems very pointless."
4,Protection is a fantastic album.,"I bought this album after Mezzanine, and was pleased to discover that it was very nearly as good. The best songs on Protection are the title song and Karmacoma, although Heat Miser is cool too. I would thoroughly recommend this album."
1,soud ceck,did not know where to send this but the sampling of the disc on your web site is so bad i could not tell from it if i like the disc or not. thank you
2,Music to take a bullet to,"The only thing I got out of listening to the title track, Protection, is fleeting remembrances of the movie The Bodyguard. This was not a good film. I am a great admirer of Tracey Thorne's voice and, as I said elsewhere, would listen to her sing the phone book; but this is not the phone book. This is teenage emotionalizing. Though I resonate with the idea of self-sacrifice, the whole point of self-sacrifice is to actually DO it, not to talk about how you would or should or might do it should the situation arise. The track is basically like listening to somebody saying, ""You know, I'd like totally run in front of a bus to save somebody, knowwhamsain?"" The whole point of self-sacrifice is that it is difficult to do. It certainly is not difficult to talk about doing, though. I don't know Tracey Thorne, but I am not really uplifted by the thought of her hypothetically jumping in front of someone to take a bullet for them."
4,don't let this be your first massive attack cd,"this cd is excellent, but you should start with blue lines if you've never owned a massive attack cd. this album is initially less accessible, but ultimately after a few listens it hooks you. reccommended for late nights and big come downs. maybe the best ""Chill out"" album ever."
3,A little dull,"I'm a fan of Portishead, Lamb and Bjork, but I find these compositions less edgy and interesting. The quality of each track is determined mainly by the guest artist. So Nicolette's ""Eurochild"" and ""Three"" stand out, followed by Tracey Thorn's ""Better Things"" and ""Protection."" Alternatively, the two instrumental tracks featuring pianist Craig Armstrong are the low points of the CD--sort of lack-luster soundtrack muzac. The Tricky and Horace Andy tracks waft somewhere in the middle."
5,Stephen Collins,"I suppose if you're not a SC fan, a 5 star rating is extemporaneously extolled, however, I am a big fan and enjoy SC's melodic voice and enthusiasm for dedications to such performers as Rick Nelson and Elvis Presley. While they were Rick's songs, there was a detection of Mr. Collins, the performer, projecting a style of his own, which I found to be a very enjoyable listening pleasure. I especially enjoyed the information enclosed in the booklet regarding Rick's daughter Tracy and some history of each song recorded. Mr. Collins should do more of the same and while he's at it...........write another book. Bravo SC, I'll follow you anywhere."
5,Big Butt,"I am 8 years old and I am in 2nd grade (my mom is typing this for me). I think this book is a very funny and interesting book. Yet I havn't yet figured out my favorite chapter, I still do like this book a lot.If you want to buy this and you are over 13, it does have a warning that you should put it down because it has robo butts, butt guns, butts that come off of people, and great white butts. People might not get it very well, unless you're familiar with the other Butt Books written by Andy Griffiths.It is very fun to read when you are 8 years old. It makes me laugh a lot when I read this book. I like it and I think you should buy it too."
4,"A really smelly good book, written by Porsche Ma","Do you know who Andy Griffths is? If you read his books, then you'll definitly love this one. If you never read his book awnser the questions below:You like really distgusting stuff like "" super mutant zombie blowflies barf poo lord""You like books which is really crazy like human travelling through a super robo-butt to 3000000000 years ago fighting a BUTT.You abosuloutely looove butts.If you awnsered ""YES"" to any of these questions, then this is the right book for you.from,A BUTT"
3,"Great opening, falters a little at the end","""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" and ""Lucky Man"" drew me to this album, and I think it is a good album. However, while the CD starts out really strong, it wanes towards the end. The first 6 or so cuts from the CD are very vocally driven and traditionally ""modern rock band sounding,"" however, the last few tracks are more instrumentally driven, with unique guitar effects, almost with a modern psychedelic vibe. Not really my thing, but if you like a combination of the two, then this CD is definitely for you. Maybe I will grow to like the latter tracks and appreciate them more. I definitely think that it is worth the buy for the first half of the CD. There are some really good tracks there."
3,Honest Review,"How in the world could someone say that The Verve is ""shoegazer"" music. If u know of My Bloody Valentine, The Boo Radleys (Its alright Forever), Lush, or Swervedriver, then there is nooooo comparison. If this is what you call shoegazer material, then I must've been listening to something completely different. I will be honest to say I've ony heard ""Bittersweet Symphony"", but how far coould they've deviated from this style? Im sorry, there's no matching the lush chords of the former bands I've mentioned."
5,Catchy and Enjoyable,"While wandering through the record store, I stopped at a listening station and listened to Urban Hymns. After listening to the beginning of ""Bittersweet Symphony,"" I was hooked and I bought it. What a great CD! All of the songs are great and extremely catchy. This is a good CD for relaxing and just listening to the music and lyrics."
5,way cool,"The Verve is way cool, perfect vibes for when you just want to chill, dream, dance, maybe twirl, add some depth to quiet air, or just to compliment your existence."
4,What A Marvel !!!,"This has got to be one of the or if not THE only album next to Nirvana's first to be considered a slap-punch to the non-existing gut of the music industry.The swirling,spacy overtones of some of the songs mixed with the substantial poppiness of the rest balanced by the poetic potency of the lyrics has left me very impressed & inspired,a feeling I havent felt towards current music in quite some time.Though the album is not perfect,if the group could pull through better than this then they may as well be the band of the future."
3,"get Storm in Heaven or the Verve EP,","I don't think people normally are compelled to write 3 star reviews, normally they only write when the really are blown away or really dont like something. However as a huge Verve fan, this album, although huge, is much more mainstream and doesn't reflect the sonic beauty reflected on their earlier and unappreciated albums. As other reviews had said, Storm in Heaven (and the Verve EP), is not just the best Verve albums, but one of the best albums period. It is sonic and similar to 'shoegazer' music but somehow a warmer, lusher, gentler take on the genre than say My Bloody Valentine (i know, heresy).Urban Hymns isn't an album in the same sense, but more a discrete collection of songs, individual, composed and mainstream. If you like Urban Hymns work your way backwards to the earlier stuff, you might be blown away. If you don't like Urban Hymns or think ""bittersweet Symphony"" is the Verve's highpoint, it's not, don't write them off on this forgettable offering."
5,More Britpop Gold ...,"As good an album to come out of Britain in the 90's as any. The Britpop influences are unmistakable; in contemporary terms, there's the Stone Roses' self-titled record, Blur, and Oasis' What's the Story (Morning Glory).Standout tracks: 'Weeping Willow' and 'Lucky Man,' although just about all of them are worth listening to. Its a shame about the controversy over Bitter Sweet Symphony, although I guess the Rolling Stones have a right to preserve their legacy. Other than that, its more than just mood music, and if you've ever found yourself liking a ballad on radio, you'll probably love this album. Don't say I didn't warn you."
4,Verve's best album,"What a shame this band broke apart a few months ago. This album, Urban Hymns, is by far their best album. Starting out with the cool, bizzare song ""Bittersweet Symphony"", this band gets you in a mellow mood.Only complaint here is the fact that the CD drags on a little bit near the end.This is a very talented band. Strong vocals, and good instrumentals shine throughout this album. Ranging from techno-ish to soft guitar rock, the Verve will ""take you down the only road they've ever been down""."
3,nothing much,"although this album contains the great ""bittersweet symphony"", the heartbreaking ""drugs don't work"", and a 5-6 interesting tracks, like ""this time"", ""velvet morning"" and ""weeping willow"", it is not much of a revelation. songs mostly sound all the same, and after a while one grows weary of the boring ""neon wilderness"" and ""catching the butterfly""."
1,Urban Pollution,"This CD is horrible. It's understood that everyone has different tastes. For anyone who enjoys the music of the 80s, don't waste your time purchasing this crap."
1,1 star minus 6,I really really truly hated this CD. Some people like it but if you're at all like me you'll detest it.
1,I just dont get brits,"Is there something wrong with me? This CD is like the number one CD in Britian. It sucks! WARNING REAL MUSIC FANS: this CD can be summed up in two words: EASY LISTENING. Sure, you may buy it for Bittersweet Symphony, but the rest of the CD is a total turn off. I don't understand a lot of things from GB - the Spice Girls, Mr. Bean, Tea and Crumpets - and you can add this band to the list."
3,"The Worst of the 3, but Still Bloody Good + Finally Album","The Verve have gone down the hill with their latest sound called 'Urban Hymes', but were still able to capture what passion they have left and make an excellent album. Get this album and the other 2 before it (witch are much better). This, most likely, will be The Verve's finally album due to the ""children"" within the band who can't get along."
3,"Pretend it's a singles compilation with ""b-sides""","This is one of my favorites in my collection although I have very rarely listened to it from beginning to end all the way through. That's because for every, truly classic recording, there is a song after it that does nothing for me. I almost always have the skip button ready. The best tracks therein: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 10. Bittersweet Symphony is so magnificently cinematic; Every time I hear it, my cinematographic sensibilities are heightened to the nth degree. As marvelous as the accompanying promo vid clip for this song is, I could add to its majesty with certain visuals I could only frame using a large-format, like IMAX. The other tracks posess such warmth and amazing arrangement. Every time I hear them my hair stands on end. Their production quality is nonpareil and I could listen to them forever. But as I said, the other songs do come off as filler. As an EP, it would get a flawless 5 star rating."
2,This is what comes of ego building,"I admit, when this album first came out I was as star struck as most of the reviewrs on this site. But the stars have gone out and what I am left with is an album that is a weak mirror of the Verve's earlier material. The album lacks the sonic appeal of A Northern Soul and does not even hold a candle to A Storm in Heaven. How tragic that this album would be the one that everyone knows. The only tracks that show any promise are the ones that Nick McCabe gets credit for. Those two songs offer a gilmpse into what the album could have sounded like if Mad Richard had chilled his ego and left Nick at the controls of the album. Richard writes good lyrics. Hre does not write good music. Everything that has his name on it has the feeling of something tired and old. So forget this album ever happened and pick up A Storm In Heaven. It deserves so much more of your attention."
1,Urban CRAP.,Boring typical british new romantic crap. To say this album can stand the test of time is a joke! There are plenty of copies in the second hand record shops already! Anybody into this trash should get a life.
1,The Ultimate Rock and Roll Suicide,"This is one of the worst albums ever released in Rock and Roll History. ""Bittersweet Symphony"" kicks off the album nuff said. If maybe one of the other songs kicked the album off it may have had a chance, but since the group chose to kick off the album with this vomit then the whole album is bad. Yes you may argue that it has the classical music which makes it sound cultural, but it's so mind-wrecking so psyche-damaging that it makes me want to suck a lead piece with a trigger at the end. The vocals are at best nasly and whiny too. I was left with the sense of ""Why Bother?"" The group comes out of Michigan which is notorious for artists like Ted Nugent, Frijid Pink, Brownsville Station, MC5, Iggy and the Stoooges etc. The Verve are the dishonorable boys from the Wolverine State."
5,the greatest rock and roll band around!!!,"This has to be the most talented band of our time. ""Urban Hymms"" is a great listen from beginning to end. If you like this one, there are two other cd's you must have... ""A Northern Soul"" and ""A Storm In Heaven"" also by The Verve. Their music will make you forget about shallow bands like Backstreet Boys, N-Sync, Barenaked Ladies, and so on.... Come On America!!!"
2,One track album.,"I was another of the tribe who bought the album based on Bittersweet Symphony, in the hope that it reflected the rest of the album. Sadly not the case. Rather dreary really, a rather poor album"
3,"It still doesn't get to the class of ""OK Computer""","A lot of critics liked that album, but I must say, that the band should practice more next time. This album boasted into 76 minutes and can get you a little bit tired if you're not in the mood for its mellow sound. I can only mention ""Sonnet"", a potential hit-single from the start and ""Catching The Butterfly"" for good."
2,Is there life after track 1?,"I second the sentiment offered by the person from California who entered the review on Feb. 20. This person said the album was one hit and 11 fillers.Now I've become quite a fan of British pop since the discovery of Radiohead's OK Computer through reviewers on Amazon. It was Amazon reviewers, coincidentally, who led me to the Verve. One confused OK Computer reviewer compared the incomparable Radiohead masterpiece to Urban Hymns.Since then it's been taking up a treasured slot in my cd case. At least I can hum that one, special, memorable tune as I go down to the used CD store and trade it for an old Radiohead import."
5,"Brilliant Pressing, Excellent Quality","I'd been looking for this edition of Urban Hymn for a while. I was very surprised to come across it new on Amazon. The packaging for this album is excellent and the quality of the vinyl is top notch. Rolling People has never sounded better! This being the first record I'd ever ordered from Amazon, I was quite impressed that they had a proper LP sized box for shipping. Definitely encourages me order more records in the future."
5,the best album this decade,this album is great its the best album proberlly in 1997 and even proberlly 1998 bitter sweet synthony made it but the song which i heard and made me by it was the drugs dont work the fantastic love song bringing back painfull memorys of a band members life i think thats what it said in some mag other great songs on it are sonnet but its far to repeditive lucky man and the great ending two velvet morning and come on over all this album deserves more than 5 star but oh wewll sweet as aye later all you verve fans who may read this but for the mean time laters
3,"Decent, but it sure as hell is not GREAT...","There are good songs on this album, Sonnet, The Drugs Don't work, Bittersweet Symphony, are all good, but i don't understand where people get off calling this album one of the best of the decade. I'm sorry, to me, it sounds like everything else, and to hear the rolling people as a total Jimi Hendrix riff rip off didn't hold favour with me at all. Granted i'm not a huge brit pop connoisseur, but i still think if there is any band to praise heavily from England its radiohead. I'm sorry, there are some good songs, but it didn't grab me, like everyone promised it would."
2,Keep taking Drugs,"What's all the hype about this album? One good song, some good psychedelic melodies, and that is it folks."
3,Bittersweet,"The first song""BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY"" may very well be the best song ever made, really and truly! ""Sonnet"" and ""Lucky Man"" are OK. This album will be remembered for two things: 1.it was their last as a band. 2.BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY. Let's face it, no one will remember any of the other songs on this CD in 10-20 years. They will however remember that this was the album that featured BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY,quite possibly the greatest song you'll ever hear. Anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. BOTTOM LINE: Fabulous song,decent album, worth the price only cause of BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY."
5,Brilliant album which truly brings out the best of the verve,"Urban Hyms is one of those rare albums which are hard to find. Evry Single song from Bitter Sweet Symphony to Come on is a Classic. This album has it all! It brings out the best melodies best tunes ever. Richard Ashcroft brings out the genius of his song writing and Nick Mc Cabe Brings out the genious of hie guitar artistry. Tracks 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11 are my fav and all are piece of classic artwork! No wonder the Verve sold so many albums!"
5,An Essential Album,"The Verve is one of the greatest bands of the decade, and this is their best album ever. Songs like ""Velvet Morning,"" ""Weeping Willow,"" and ""Lucky Man"" are perfect. I've played this CD nonstop since its release and I've never gotten tired of it. If you don't have ""Urban Hymns"" already, you must get it!"
5,THIS ALBUM RULES!!!!,I love this band and I love this CD!!! I saw these guys in concert and they were awesome!!!
3,Merely average,"Admittedly I've not perused other Verve releases (A Northern Soul, etc), but if this is the best they've got then perhaps I'll stay away. The bookends ""Bittersweet Symphony"" and ""Come on"" are great, but most of the other songs are just average, sounding like musically-thought-out Oasis ballads. ""Neon Wilderness"" and ""Lucky Man"" are the best of the rest. Elsewhere, the strings sound forced and don't fit the music surrounding them. The melodies are also fairly weak and the tunes too bare. When Richard Ashcroft sings ""The drugs don't work/They just make it worse/But I know I'll see your face again"" I really don't give a damn. It sounds like they want to surpass Radiohead and Spiritualized, but it can never happen anyway. If they wanted to try they shuld have styed broken up longer or changed the line up."
3,"Good album, although many tunes are hit or miss.","""Bittersweet Symphony"" is a great song, and the 2nd cut is a nice ballad-like tune. Otherwise, the album is kind of hit or miss. Many tunes just have no punch. I have nothing against the members of the band catchin' a buzz every now and then, but not if this is the effect it has."
3,A solidly mediocre album,"I bought the CD for ""Bittersweet Symphony"" and crossed my fingers on the other 12 tracks. As I feared, they are entirely forgettable. The liner notes help explain why: ""Bittersweet Symphony"" was written by by Mick Jagger/Keith Richards. Aha..."
3,moody blues copycats,"well i love bitter sweet symphony and sonnet, the drugs dont work and many of the other songs, but it sounds so much like the orginal rock bands, moody blues, fleetwood mac and others. im not that old, but i do know and love those bands and i can realize how they can bse music on it, but lets not copy completey. i really do like this cd and think it was well worth the money and think anyone should buy it because they will enjoy it."
1,Noisy,This product is no good. The signal is constantly dropping out with the worst feedback rejection ever. I do not recommend it.
3,It's just OK,I wouldn't buy another one. I broke my within two weeks of using. Having to replace the battery i accidently pulled the wire alose not even knowing I did it until i tried to use. It's cheap plan and simple. I also don't like the idea that I have to constantly replace the battery in both parts.
3,Designed for children,"For $20 dollars this is an ok product, but it is NOT designed for adults. If you are expecting to use this during any kind of presentation, don't bother. The headset is 1/2 the size it needs to be for adults. It should fit kids just find however, perhaps 11 or under."
3,Wireless Microphone.....,"I was going to rate this with 4 stars due to the clarity, but when it fell with only a couple of feet of distance, the receiver broke. The device is cheaply made and would reconsider buying this product. I'm in the market of looking for better one without paying an arm and a leg. Best Buy sells a similar product, but just as cheaply made and cost more."
3,First experiment with wireless,"This unit is the least expensive way to begin experimenting wireless vocal. It is a fairly good unit for the price. I didn't encounter any loss of signal within the distance range.I would like to see the following improvements, (of cause with increase in cost which may be worth it.:1. The wire on the receiver that act as an antenna should be replaced with a built-in extendable/retrackable metal antenna that will be facing upward reather than downward as with the wire. The wire will eventually break off and render the unit useless.2. The headset microphone should be much smaller. The present piece covers the whole mouth.With these two changes will greatly improve the unit"
2,Protector without Glue,"Hello. I looking forward for this item. I want it very much, but when i received it I was disappointed. Really Tank protector was with very bad glue junction. When I install it on tank of my motorbike in few minutes it came unstuck. Then when i check the Glue surface I found out that it was like plasticine. I move off plasticine in few minutes fully. Then purchased special double sticky tape and using it install again the protector. It is fine now."
4,Carrie Fisher in a lovely performance,"FAERIE TALE THEATRE's adaptation of THUMBELINA is one of their most imaginative, featuring Carrie Fisher in the title role.A lonely char-woman (Conchata Ferrall) is given a magical barley seed, which sprouts into a lovely flower. When the flower opens, out pops beautiful Thumbelina (Carrie Fisher). The char-woman's wish to be a mother has been granted, and the pair could not be happier. But Thumblina's happy life with her mother is short-lived when the tiny creature is kidnapped by Mother Toad...A beautiful entry in the series. Co-starring William Katt as the Prince of the Flowers and Burgess Meredith as Mr Mole. Carrie Fisher is radiant in her performance."
4,Helpful in making eclairs.,"I was a little nervous this pan would not fit my needs, but in the first use I found it to be very useful. I would recommend anyone who hasn't ever made eclairs, or who hasn't made them for awhile to purchase this pan. It was so helpful to know what I needed to prepare for filling instead of guessing. I am considering getting another pan to go with this one."
3,It's okay,"It seems like a fairly nice pan for what it is and appears exactly as advertised. I gave it a lower rating more due to my preference vs. quality of the pan. I think I have gotten too used to the heavier non-stick pans, so this pan will rarely get used except when I need this shape. If you are not used to tinplate pans then your experience may be the same."
2,Missing extremely important information,"I am a clinical professor in a school of pharmacy and am admittedly biased toward traditional ""western"" medicine. However, any objective person would have to agree that there are major ""gaps"" in the information this book provides. In the section on St. John's wort, this book states that there are no known contraindications or drug interactions with St. John's wort. There are in fact serious drug interactions with this product, including anti-rejection drugs (resulting in at least one case of organ rejection in a renal transplant patient) and potentially fatal interactions with other anti-depressants (most importantly MAOIs). This book has extensive information on historical use of herbs, pharmacology and uses... but lacks important safety information. No clinician should use this book as his/her sole source of information on herbal products."
1,You know you've wasted money when...,"When I ordered this book, I expected a tongue-in-cheek retrospective of the ups and downs of being the parent of a gifted child. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Very wrong. This book is no more than a regurgitated compilation of common lists found at every gifted site on the internet. Any parent who has come this far looking for information on parenting their gifted child has already seen every characteristic list in this book at least two or three times for free. Do not waste your money on this book."
2,Not Worth the Money,This book is heavy on vague lists of what to look for in children who might be gifted. It contains very few specifics and reads more like a book intended to convince parents that their children are gifted rather than a serious analysis of the extent of their skills. Not worth the money to me.
2,too simplistic,"This is not the book to buy if you want tips on how to parent the gifted child. Galbraith wastes time catagorizing different types of ""giftedness"" and ends each section with a few tips on how to parent. I felt this book was overpriced for the information it contained."
3,A good read,"nothing groundbreaking here, but it is a nice look at early special warfare. The British SAS invented special warfare during WWII and this books looks at some of the earlier operations. Thre are some real good adventures here. The book is a first hand account. The book does not have any analysis. Any fan of the SAS should give it a shot."
3,Explore alternatives,"Explore alternatives before buying this system. Although the cartridge lasts longer than others, it is very difficult for a person to replace, especially a woman or older man. The company makes it sound so easy, just insert and turn 1/4. You don't know you have it in right until you turn it on and then after 30 seconds of water running, it falls off and water is all over the cabinet. It's inexpensive compared to a whole house system, but I wish I had a whole house system instead of fighting with the cartridge when I need to replace it. Once in place, the filter does do an excellent job of removing bad water taste. If you're a handyman and able to maneuver under sinks, this will serve you fine. I am very frustrated at how hard this filter is to insert exactly right. It's not easy doing it by yourself and your neck and arms will ache from trying to get it in."
3,Difficult Installation,"The unit works fine but it a devil to install if you don't like squatting or bending over and sitting in an awkward position while attempting to install the cartridge. I didn't pull the lever down completely to turn the water off for installation and I had water gushing all over my kitchen. If you do it properly, it is over in a jiffy. I have a water softener system which causes the Everpure to be used up much more quickly, so that is a problem too. I'm replacing this cartridge after just four months of use with two people."
1,Cheap plastic fittings leak leak leak,"One of these things is in the house I am renting. The cheap plastic fittings on the head unit leaked like crazy. Fix one leak, and another one starts. Teflon tape, epoxy putty. You name it. Nothing works. I had to disconnect the whole darn thing just to keep the cabinet under the sink from rotting away."
3,Good product. Dumb Tee fitting.,"I had this at my old house, so I bought another when we moved. For the amazon price, and the quality of the water that comes out of it, you'd be silly not to buy it. It supposedly comes with everything you need, but surprisingly comes with some dumb tee fitting that's supposed to branch off from the water supply to your filter that, as far as I know, doesn't fit any standard 1/2"" pipe fitting from the water supply in any normal American household. Buy some other adaptor (AND the dedicated water filter faucet) before you crack all the connections under the sink!"
5,easy,"As indicated in previous reviews, theInstallation was quick and easy. So far we have been very happy with the filter. It is working exactly as promised"
4,good smell,"This is a nice product and smells great on my 4 year daughter. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is because of the seller. It took almost 5 weeks and an e-mail before I got the perfume. They told me my order was lost in the shipping department."
1,dont trust.,i ordered something as a xmas present. they canceled my order a week later and raised the price significally with no reason of why they canceled my order.
3,"Not accurate, missing references to some important issues.","At first I was impressed with the book, the reading was quite easy. But then ""facts"" about the number of Afro-Americans serving in the Civil War were confusing. At least three different numbers were cited. The differences in the numbers had a factor of three or more. That simply cannot be the case. Other inaccuracies appeared in the text which lead me to the impression that the book was researched by different people, maybe students, I really don't know. From an intellectual point of view, the discrepancies are glaring and leaves one the believe Claude Anderson's efforts were disingenuous. If the author cited blacks as victims of the holocaust, then he should have cited references to support this notion."
4,ABout Time,"I can't believe I went as long as I did without a document feeder on my scanner. When I bought this new scanner I almost balked at the cost of the document feeder.The scanner is simply outstanding, and had I been reviewing it alone I'd have to give it five stars. If I were reviewing the document feeder strictly based on time and labor savings, five stars again. However, the document feeder has the regularly recurring habit of feeding sheets at a slight but increasing angle until, eventually, it jams. Yes, you can work around it, but it's a colossal pain when it happens.If you want perfectly aligned, trouble-free scans, spend even more money and get a scanner with built-in document feeder. If you can life with the occasional crooked page and occasional jam, this combination is tough to beat.One star off for the light-weight feeder workmanship; otherwise, I love this scanner and document feeder."
2,Red and Green lines on .jpg,"I kept getting Red and Green lines on my scanned images. I went to Help online and there was a section on how to clean the scan ""glass"" to remove dust and such. Only problem is the path the the picture feeds through to scan is a clear plastic sheet and it already had scratched on it. Can't clean those.Now if you didn't have the lines: The APF is GREAT and the few I did try running through it went through straight, no jams. Not too noisy and the software is pretty easy to work also."
3,Gary Ezzo's other book .... POTTY TRAINING 1-2-3 IS BETTER,"I absolutely love the Babywise series, and have used them for my 4 children. I like the Potty Training 1-2-3 better than PottyWise. With the tools given in that book, we had our 3rd child who was dragging his heels with the whole process, potty-trained within 3 weeks. So if you're considering this book, get Gary Ezzo's other one - much better value."
1,ChicagoDad,"This book was disappointing from a well-know author. There was not new information, nothing thoughtful or ""meaty"", nothing that really helped us at all. Just a lot of repeated and totally common sense information presented in an uninteresting way. My wife didn't make it past page 10, but i finished it. Total waste of time."
3,Took some and left some,"I LOVE Dr. Ezzo's other books, so I decided to get this one when my eldest got ready for potty training. There are SEVERAL good ideas and suggestions that I gleaned from PottyWise. I ended up piecing together a myriad of suggestions from this and other sources for my own personalized approach. I AM glad I have this book, so I can review some more tips as I have another child rapidly approaching potty readiness."
2,Poor quality writing and information,"I was a fan of On Becoming Babywise, so I thought this would also be helpful. It was not. This was not that different from information you can get on any internet search on potty training, and definitely not worth $10. Also, the book was not well edited - there are typos, which is crazy for such a widely published series. I requested a refund right away, and amazon gave me the money back but said I could keep the book - I guess they don't want it either! :)"
2,"Oh, Ellen . . . WHY?","I adore Ellen and watch her show daily. I thought this book would be hilarious, but I was extremely disappointed, and I'm not a picky reader. It's not well written and jumps around too much. The jokes don't carry because Ellen's not there telling them and showing visual expressions. There's no point, and she's either trying too hard, or she's just not funny on paper. This book is unfortunate. Ellen is better than this."
2,a terrible disappointment,"I am a big Ellen Degeneres fan, this audio CD does her no justice. Although she reads it herself, much of her comedy is her impeccible sense of timing and her facial expressions that accompany her schtick. Obviously she can't use either of those tools with the audio CD. Hence, it comes across flat and lifeless. While the material is funny enough, I'm sure Ellen herself will admit, the delivery is the most important part of comedy. As anyone who has ever tried to tell a joke will attest it is all about timing and delivery."
3,Irony in Humor,"Make no mistake about it; I love the Ellen DeGeneres half hour sitand the talk show. It's hilarious! This book had the same kind of conversational humor that she does on her show. I cracked up over her depictions of what we need in life and what's unnecessary (I'm with you on that moving sidewalk in the airport, what's that about?) There were many circumstances where I had to rub my forehead or look at my shoes in an attempt to not burst out laughing and look like another nutcase on the street. But sometimes she just flat out lied to the point where I was wondering ""Is this a joke or is she serious or is this just a really bad story?"" The whole chapter on her father could've been cut out altogether because it was a bunch of gibberish. Speaking of gibberish, that bonus chapter was dumb. I liked it when she took real events and made them funny, not when she just lied for old time's sake. Overall, a very entertaining read and I can't wait to rewind to the first book!"
4,Unabridged audio,"From the witty observations to the tongue in cheek delivery, Ellen narrates this almost the way she delivers her standup.I don't think I would have enjoyed the book near as much as I enjoyed this audio.Recommended (Audio only) for Ellen fans."
2,Where's the humor,"About 3 lines that are really funny. Almost boring. Haven't seen her in real life, but I hope her shows are better than this book."
1,"It is so lame, I was almost embarrassed for her.","I wanted so badly to like this cd because it was given to me as a gift and I hated for the giver to have wasted her money. But it was a waste. The book is sooooo lame, I would have been embarrassed for Ellen except I know she is making a lot of money off the book in spite of how bad it is. I have always been a fan of Ellen's, but this book was mostly just a rehash of old material. She really should be ashamed of herself for being so lazy that she just regurgitated old stuff instead of actually writing a book!"
1,Terrible,"The Funny Thing Is ,there's absolutely nothing funny about this book.It's just rambling about nothing.They should have called it The Boring Thing Is,This Book."
1,LIMP HUMOR!,WASTE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THIS BOOK- GO AHEAD! HOMOPHOBIC I'M NOT ALTHOUGH I DO BELIEVE THIS WOMAN HAS CHOSEN TO HAVE HER SEXUALITY AS HER MAJOR IDENTITY AND NOT HER COMEDY. AS SUCH I FIND HER HUMOR SECONDARY TO A CREEPY PERSONA.
3,"Funny, but not that funny","I guess I just put my expectations too high. This book is funny, but not laugh-out-loud funny like I had anticipated. I also felt like it wasn't totally Ellen who was telling the stories. It seems like Ellen told these funny stories to a write who made them a lot less funny (which might actually be the case). However, this book is still well-written and provides some insight into Ellen's early career and life that I would've never know otherwise. Overall, it's a decent, worthwhile read for true Ellen fans."
2,A Letdown From one of my Favorite Comedians,"As a long standing fan of Ellen's comedy, I was disappointed with this effort. She presents a collection of comedy that seemed to range between a little genuine humor and a lot of mediocre humor.I have found myself laughing deeply at some of Ellen's standup, thus this book left me wondering if part of her comic genius is in her delivery. The book is not a total loss, as there are a few moments when Ellen reaches hilarity, but mostly the book feels like a comedic struggle.I anticipate reading more from Ellen in the future, but hope it significantly surpasses the quality of this book."
4,"Overall, a good book.","While this book was not as funny as I expected, nor as funny as Ellen's first book, it was still entertaining and I did laugh a lot. A good book."
2,Try reading it out loud,"I took this book on a weekend away, thinking it would be light and fun. It was very light and mildly fun, but I wasn't really that engaged by it. Then I began reading a few passages to my brother that I thought he would enjoy. We both laughed out loud and I began to appreciate her clever witticisms more. This led me to the discovery that Degeneres' humor is meant to be spoken. Her essays read more like a transcript of a good standup routine than freestanding comic prose. So if you like Ellen, get this book and try taking turns reading it out loud with a friend. It might be a fun way to pass the time on a road trip. My brother and I certainly got a few good snorting chuckles out of it!"
2,Is Ellen angry?,I have enjoy Ellen for years. I've seen her current show as well as her stand-up routine. This book has a feeling of anger to it that I don't usually associate with her. I kept reading hoping that the mood of the book would change but it didn't. I was disappointed in the book but still enjoy Ellen as a talk show host and performer.
1,The Funny Thing is.. It's Not Funny,"Its not fresh, it's not funny, it's just lame. As a longtime fan, I was looking forward to listening to the audio book on a 6 hour road trip-- spent $30 on it. After just five minutes, and another forced 10 minutes to give it another chance, my friend and I realized that not only could we not continue listening to it, we couldn't even ""recycle"" it to a bed-ridden friend in need of some amusement. Pure dreck. How did this get published?Karen, San Francisco"
3,The Funny thing is...this book is not that funny,"I really enjoy watching Ellen's talk show, she is funny, spunky and entertaining, however if you watch her show or seen her do stand up, you will not think this book is funny, a lot of the material that is in the book I heard her talk about on her show.Nonetheless there are some funny excerpts, good book for an Ellen fan."
1,One amazingly poor piece of writing,"I found this book to be quite disappointing. I bought it for some light reading during a plane flight to Hawaii and pitched it after 3 chapters. The book has no substance and although it tries to be funny it comes off with zero humor. In fact, after deciding to stop reading it, the person next to me asked to see it. She browsed it for about 1/2 an hour, gave it back to me and said ""in a word terrible."" I have to believe that the *only* reason this book got published is because it was written by Ms. Degeneres. No one else would have been able to get this piece of babble past a junior editor."
3,The funny thing is...it was pretty good. (audio version),"Unfortunately, this book started out strong, then faded off near the end. The last chapter or so did not fulfil the promise of the earlier chapters.It may have been a rehash of older material - I can't comment on that for certain - but there were parts where I did laugh, and laugh loudly. Good comedy can be enjoyed on repeat visits.I was especially glad, however, that I chose the audio version of this book over the print edition. The author (naturally) had just the right pace, inflection, and tone to enhance the story. I don't know if my own reading would have had the same comic delivery and timing.Ths book is not great literature, but was a worthy listen during my commute. It didn't require much concentration, but provided a welcome change from the talk radio guys."
3,"Cute, funny essays&#65533;","This book of essays ranging from ""Terrible Fashion Trends"" to ""Why Being In Prison Wouldn't Be So Bad"" show why Ellen's humor has succeeded in making her a great comedian with a hit talk show. Many times during reading, I felt myself chuckle or say out loud ""Yes!"" I even read some passages aloud to family members. While you might not come away with any deep insights, it's a light and charming comedy read, perfect for the beach."
5,Loved it !,"Yes Ellen rambles, but she has a point, most of the time. Even when she doesn't it's really entertaining ! That's the basis of Ellen's humor. I think the book is a very true reflection of her personality and humor as we know it. Very good read."
5,Wonderfully charming and smart,"I read and liked Ellen's first book, and Ellen's new book is full of hilarious new stories and observations that I've never heard. You will find her outrageous tales and insights to be a delight. Ellen is a gifted and unique storyteller. I particularly liked her whimsical essay..The Brunch Bunch, and the story about her father taking her, as a child, to see houses they never end up buying. She also offers a very funny tale of visiting her therapist to go over The Things That Are Bothering Me This Week.Ellen is a fine observer of life: she seems to understand exactly what it feels like when we run into everyday obstacles. The Funny Thing...will make you smile on every page."
4,Finding the FUNNY in Ellen,"I wanted to buy my daughers some fun bilingual children's books on amzon.com. I went to the kids' favorite children's Latino barrio book, DRUM, CHAVI, DRUM!/TOCA, CHAVI, TOCA! to check for similar items. There, I saw that a person who had bought that book, had also bought a FINDING NEMO CD. I had never heard of FINDING NEMO. I clicked on it and it took me to Ellen Degeneres and all her books. I bought all her books and forgot about buying books for my children! Her first book, I HAVE A POINT (or something like that) was hysterically funny (the dog sledding part nearly made me pee my pants). After reading her first book, this one isn't as funny, but finding the FUNNY in Ellen isn't hard. If you enjoy Ellen's sense of humor, this book is a must. Besides, I hear she is donating parts of the funds to help rebuild parts of california after the fire! Go get it; it's a good buy!"
3,The Funny Thing Is,"I thought it would be a good read, but so far I have found it just readable. It may sound funny to some people but to me it is a very dry spence of humour"
4,"It's very good, but I liked her first book better","The followup to My Point...and I do Have One, this book contains a lot of material from her HBO special The Beginning and, I hate to say, it's not as funny. I'm glad I read it and it is funny but I can't imagine re-reading it a dozen times like the first book, or re-watching it like the HBO special. But I am an Ellen fan so I enjoyed it. I do like the fact that it's copyrighted to ""Crazy Monkey Inc."" Tee hee.For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
4,It's Ellen,"This book is very entertaining and as you read it, you can almost hear Ellen's voice in your head. A lot of the material seems to be just like her act, which is a good thing. The only downside is that being sort of like her act makes it a fun read, but not one with any real story or time line."
1,Mindless Dribble,"I like Ellen, I think she's funny but this is not funny. If you can imagine being locked in a room alone with Dori from disney's Nemo, then you know what this book is like. It's funny for about five minutes after that mindless dribble!"
3,A few good laughs,"I think Ellen Degeneres is a funny lady to listen, normally. However, I actually think I would have enjoyed reading this book more than actually hearing her read it aloud. It was just something about the jokes that were involved. Although this was the case, I still enjoyed hearing the book because there were some pretty funny parts. Not all of the book is laugh out loud funny, but overall enjoyable."
2,"Sorry Ellen, Didn't Like it","I'm a fan of Ellen's and love most of the stuff she does on her TV show, but this book is a total waste of time. What a disappointment. VERY little of it got a chuckle out of me. There was one decent chapter, but I can't remember which one it was. I'd love to be able to give Ellen a glowing review, but I'd be fibbing!"
1,The Funny Thing Wasn't...,"I like Ellen Degeneres. I think she has been an excellent emcee on award programs, her own talk show and her sitcom - which was canceled and shouldn't have been. I had this book on my ""Wish List"" and received it from a family member for Christmas. I really looked forward to reading it. I settled in expecting to be laughing out loud, but I never did. I expected the book to get better as I continued to read it - it NEVER did! All in all quite a disappointment."
5,TV's best kept secret!,"For those with a witty, dry sense of humor, this show is a god-send. Fast paced, short episodes offer tongue-in-cheek humor and a varied cast of appealing characters. This season one DVD will catch you up, and season two is now in progress. My only complaint is that there aren't more episodes to enjoy- I sure hope they keep renewing this fun show!"
3,Funny take on Monsanto,"Fast, facile jokes in a similar style to 30 Rock or Arrested Development make this caricature of Monsanto (a nefarious R&D heavy company that makes both GMO food and pesticides) a lot of fun. In contrast to Arrested Development, however, the characters are not very well developed, and so I'm watching it with far less empathy than those in AD. The lack of social empathy is more like 30 rock where only a few characters are singled out for elaboration but they are so over-caricatured and ancillary that they are unrelatable as humans: in Ted this is the zany scientists and cold ceo and in 30 rock Jenna, Tracy, the paige and the writing staff."
1,This show is....,"Awesome. There was one other one star review so I made this so people would know he is so terribly wrong.Lem and Phil are so damn funny by season 2 that I would sell a kidney to see a season 3 of this show. The lie detector episode in season 2 made me cry. Season 1 starts slow, but Portia de Rossi knocks it out of the park the entire time without ever once slowing down. The cast is great, especially the scientists.If I was a terminally ill child I would use my Make-A-Wish to get a season 3 greenlighted."
5,awesome,So disappointed this was canceled. Easily one of my favorite shows. Super funny and clever- have watched them over and over.
5,Genius!,"This was easily the funniest thing on TV in the Spring of 2009, far more brilliant and promising than the tired Office rehash ""Parks and Recreation"" (as much as I love the stars of that show). Recommended for fans of the rapid fire, occasionally absurd humor of ""30 Rock"" and ""Arrested Development"". Season one was cut woefully short, so I can't wait for the full run to come out on video!"
5,better off ted,i just can't believe they cancelled this show. it was so groundbreaking and funny. every episode was new and original. the writers should win awards.
5,The more you watch the funnier it gets,"We really are enjoying this series. The characters grow in the show have grown in personality. Great chemistry amongst the cast and sharp, witty script writing."
2,could be better,"this show is weak! but, some episodes have some giggles every 5 minutes or so. it's ok but, if you want a good comedy show, watch modern family, it's promising ever episode for more and more laughs."
1,How bad?,"I cannot believe that so many folks thought this trite , poorly written and acted THING was so good. It shows how many stupid network TV shows have destroyed the brains of young Americans. Comparing this POS to ""Dead like Me"", ""Pushing Daisys"", and ""Wonderfalls"" is like comparing spam to prime rib, or Wonder Bread to a freshly baked San Francisco sour dough."
1,This show is lame and uninspired...,"Ignore all the 5 star reviews for this stinker of a show...Comparing this to Arrested Development or The Office is absurdity... The laughs in this show are few and far between and I would steer clear of this mess. As a reference point, favorite comedy shows of mine are Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development and Tim & Eric Awesome Show."
3,Its OK but too big,The product functions fine. But the extra size on the phone is a little much to keep in your pocket.
3,Now IS Forever,"I bought this movie when Hollywood Videos was going out of business. Never heard of most of the actors. Popped in the DVD one night when I could not sleep. Even though for most adults the plot and ending will seem obvious, it is captivating like going down a lazy river that you know well but still enjoy. I think it would be a good movie for teens despite the R rating, it has all positive messages. I am jaded so it didn't strike me in the heart like it would my teen girls. It nice to see something that doesn't have the usual storylines and carries a sweet message of hope. It was interesting seeing the Native American Indian viewpoints played out. I did not like the not so obvious western religious undertones and heavy handed messages. Still was quite beautifully filmed. One of the good lessons is Now is Forever, your actions will have consequences for the rest of your life,(and maybe even after) so think about what you do. I really loved the soundtrack and will buy it when I find it."
2,Cheesy chick flick,"I like the acting and the two characters do have chemistry but there just is not much plot or character development.SPOILERWhen you go from Mia's character leaving town to becoming a star, the transition is so fast that it just is not believable.And quite frankly, the movie is dull and is a waste of Adam Beach.Mia, while I do think she can act to an extent, seems to be typecaste now. (If you've seen her on the L word- another self destructive character)Overall, a decent sob movie but a waste of good actors and could have been done better."
4,Now and Forever,A bit cheesy in the writing and in some of the acting but a great story with a twist at the end. I didn't see that coming. I'm a HUGE Adam Beach fan so I'll watch anything he's in. He MADE this movie. Carried and delivered. I'll always keep it in my collection.
5,Now and forever,I've been looking for this movie since I saw it on lifetime a couple of years ago. Good love story
4,Great movie,I seen this movie on TV. I was overwhelmed. The movie is a very good love romance full of fun & spirituatility & belief and a well put together drama. I really enjoyed it.Very good actors..
5,FANtastic B-side!,"If you are a big Pearl Jam fan I reccomend getting this cd because ""out of my mind"" is really great! It is worth buying the cd for that song alone."
3,I miss Jessica&Hume,"This was a very good play with Dick Van Dyke & Mary Tyler Moore, but I really wish you could find a DVD of the play with Hume & Jessica as the players. They were the best!!! It was on Video Tape but someone should come out with a DVD!!!!"
3,Not the greatest,I love Dick Van Dyke but this is NOT his best movie. It is boring actually and all he does is curse though out the whole movie--which really didn't add to the movie at all. The ending was a disappointment also. It will go in with the collection of other movies by him but I won't watch it again.
3,Not like original,"Saw on Broadway with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. Not since. This did not seem like the same, but then it's been a long time. This was ok but more surly and antagonistic than I remembered. Lots of swearing and posturing by Van Dyke. Not the comedy I remembered."
5,The gin game,Very nice item. Would recommend this to others. Pleased and can not wait to start watching it and sharing it with others.
4,Excellent general electronic metronome,"This is my second one of these, after losing the first. The teal color makes it fairly easy to find. It is reasonably loud (with a volume control), and I've not had any problems hearing it over the piano.I do find the tempo control a little awkward to use, though. It is much nicer than the electronic metronomes that just have up/down buttons. However, the dial is on the bottom, and hidden when sitting on the base. It is a little clumsy to use when repeating something while gradually increasing the tempo. However, it seems to still be sufficiently loud even when placed upside down (usually with the speaker into the music desk)."
2,Time to Ride,"I thought this game would have been much better. Graphics are bad u get to talk to about three people limited actions, u get one horse I think the jumps are near impossible to make and it was short and plain. The mystery made no sense at all really leaves you hanging. You have to actually figure out what to do next and how to do the dressage part no instructions at all. Stupid i would say."
2,"NOT the best game, BAD!","At first it was ok, but taking care of your horse is SO tedious,every 5 minutes you need to feed, groom, clean the stable, and put beddingdown. When you do that, the horse is not anywhere in the stable or any of the paddocks. The jumping courses are hard, you have to get SOclose and you still knock down polls and the turns are impossible.The cross country is SO hard, the trees disapear and the jumps disapear too, which makes it SO hard. I got to the point where you have to find your way through the path and the graphics are so bad, I couldn't see myway, so I couldn't do it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!I would recommend saddle up, time to ride, it is pretty good."
2,Technical Difficulties,"This game is so annoying, whenever I ride the horse, the rider is in front of the horse, and the horse is difficult to control. Save your money and don't get this game, I've bought two copies and had the same problem on both of my computers."
2,Field piano music,My other review of Field reflects my personal thoughts on Field. This is for Field enthusiasts.
1,WRONG WIDTH DESCRIBED,"I ORDERED THE 11XX AND THE ""XX"" WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING 4E. WHEN IT ARRIVED, THE BOX STATED ""XX"" BUT ALSO SAID ""5E"" WHICH MADE THEM TOO LARGE.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST."
3,nice but didnt fit me good,"nice soft shoes and I liked the single velcro band...reason I had to return them was my custom made orthodic arch inserts didnt fit very well and made my heel rise too high in the back. Otherwise, I would have kept them."
1,Propet Scandia shoes,"Do Not Buy this Shoe!Runs small, leather stiff. Not suitable for seniors.In addition, there is a service charge for restocking.I will not buy from this company again.Jo in Carlsbad, CA"
5,Very comfortable and practical shoes.,I bought these for my 96 year old father who suffers from PAD. He likes them very much. They have extra room in the toe area which enables him to avoid ulcers. They are easy for him to put on himself because of the velcro straps. They are now the only shoes he wears.
5,Walking on a cloud,"My Dad is 87 years old and has swollen feet. It's so hard to find shoes that fit him, but when he put these on (size 11.5 EEEEE) he smiled and said he felt like he was walking on clouds. It cheered me so much to see him so happy. The fit was perfect, and the single strap (with velcro) is easy for my Dad to manage."
1,Too little room over arch,"Bought a 12 EEE, which is fine for length and width, but the top, over the arch, is not big enough. Most lacing shoes can open enough for my foot but this one does not. The problem with shoes that one doesn't try on first. But, I think that as I wear these more they will work out. Just unusually uncomfortable right now is all, but I don't think that they should be. Also, they are pretty heavy for low quarters. That's one ding for tightness over the arch and another for weight.Edited because these are just not breaking in. They hurt my feet rather badly. I've worn them almost daily since they came, so can't just send them back. Probably donate them."
4,Great for wide feet,"Yes, I am female and often wear a man's shoe. How else am I going to get EEEEE width shoes for my ""duck feet?"" I bought these to wear around the house but they are really more for going out, being heavy and sturdy. Mine are a bit scuffed now, but no more than you would see with any other shoe.I subtracted one star because I am getting some rubbing on the left on the small toe where there's a seam inside the shoe. It may not have been fair to do that though, because it doesn't happen on the right. It is probably just the way that foot is, rather than something inherently wrong with the shoe."
3,EV Eliminator 15,"I have had these speakers since 1996. They are a descent speaker. I used to DJ small partys of around 100 people or so and I blew 2 speakers. I got a good replacement speaker from US Speaker in NJ for cheap and they are a much better woofer than the stock EV woofer. I am running them with a Crown Macro Tech 1200. I think if I was to purchase new speakers I would recommend Yorkville. They have great sounding speakers, powered and non powered. The Yorkville non powered speakers aren't much more the the EV and are better..."
5,Wonderful Independant Film!,"Extremly funny video! If you enjoyed Bill Murray in ""Lost In Translation"", you will want to see him as the manipulative attorney who only takes divorce cases he can win. Great Indie Film."
1,The editor is incompetent. Don't waste your time or money!,"I picked this book up today and heard Chris Dortch interviewed by the local sports radio station. He was a total dolt who couldn't articulate any justification for their picks. For example, this review, which weights about 2 llbs, doesn't rank Oregon State in their Top 25. Maybe SI is getting ahead of themselves by putting OSU #1, but every reputable poll has them in the Top 20. When asked why the Beavers were completely overlooked, Dortch responded that they don't follow the Pac-10 closely enough and that they really liked USC.How can you be a reputable college football commentator and not follow the Pac-10 closely? Maybe they can just compile the media guides from 1990's Top 25 finishers. It'd be cheaper, and would be just as useful as this piece of junk!"
5,Fantastic reissue,"This is great 70's blues! It's not overproduced, and it's got a great funky & soulful vibe throughout the entire record. An excellent place to start your modern blues collection & the cd has been remastered with bonus tracks - over 70 minutes!!!!"
4,Hunter fan light control,"The control panel is good for the fans for speeds of fans can be controlled here.Because the new low energy light is not able to be dimmed, this part of the control is obselete. If your lights under the fan is made of of light bulbs, it is fine then."
1,"Great functionality, terrible quality","We installed a ceiling fan/light in our master bedroom as part of a remodel and were able to run the required 3-wire romex to work the fan and light separately from the switchbox. After weeks of work, we installed the Hunter switch as the cherry on top. We were ecstatic. It took a while to get used to the slider switches and the master on/off switch for the preset felt a little chintzy, but we were quickly spoiled by the smooth dimmer and 4-speed fan control. Our joy lasted less than a year. The knob on the fan control broke off. I could now see how the knobs were attached to the sliders and it looks like they are designed to fail: a blade in the back of the knob is pressure-fit into a slot in the thin plastic slider. When you screw down the cover plate on a switch, you expect the job to last for years or decades. This switch lasted only a few months. Very disappointing."
1,"SLIDING SWITCH IS PLASTIC JUNK, at least on the fan side",I have to agree with Mr. Davis on this one. I have this switch in my kitchen to operate the fan. The sliding switch that operates the 4 speed fan broke off but NOT at the actual knob where it could be glued back on but on the stem making it IMPOSSIBLE to put the tiny knob back on. They cannot engineer and build it out of something solid but rather screw the consumer into buying frail plastic junk that does not hold up.
1,Learning from the mistakes of others,"I'm so glad that I came to trusty 'ol Amazon to price these controls and read the reviews. My fiance and I just bought a house and the 27182 model, without the preset, is installed all over this house. There are ceiling fans in every room. We love the fans, and the controls seem to be holding up pretty well. All but the master bedroom. The light switch on that one is missing. Was when we moved in. So, naturally, with all the others in tact and found throughout the house, I figured a straight replacement was in order. You guys have changed my opinion on that and I appreciate it very much. Obviously, the problem I have with the switch here is a very common and fast occurring one with these switches. Thanks for saving me the money, time and most of all frustration on this one."
1,Extremely Low Quality,I've installed several of these dual controls throughout the house and I have had to replace every one within a year of installation due to the slider controls breaking. It's a great concept but the quality of the product is severly lacking.
1,Sent it back - No rating,"Don't Know... Sent it back since it had a 3 wire connection. Our old wiring in the house has 2 wires. It was less costly to set up a hand-held remote with 2 wires than rewiring and adding new switch box(es), patch and paint walls with the Hunter 27183 control remote...Amazon has a great return policy. You click return. It shows your purchases from last 30 days that are allowed to be returned. You print a packing slip and prepaid address label. Box it up. Give it to USPS and you are done... Amazon has their act together..."
1,Too many duplications in this book,This book did not meet my needs at all. They claim to have all these listings and many of them are duplicates. You'd be better off buying the magazines and getting your sources from them. I do not recommend this book and would not buy future editions.
5,This is a time saver!,This book has become my phone and address book for the bead business. If you are looking for anything this book tells you where to find it. I found alot of new sources for things I need for my jewelry designing business.
5,Hard to find items finally found!,I have looked for years for some components that are hard to find and thanks to this book I finally found them! Not only that--I also found items I regularily buy at much cheaper prices. I will save so much by using this book!
1,I don't really need it...,"I bought this book out of curiosity (I own a beading business), but I really don't know what to do with it. I get the same (and more up to date) info from catalogs, etc."
2,Disappointing...,"The information is good, however, the book is more like a catalog of advertising than a real resource book. I felt cheated having to pay $20 for that."
5,Essential for a bead store owner,"When I started my bead store, the information in this book provided me with all I needed to know."
1,A waste...,"This book is poirly written and highly commercial. You can get the same information on the web, on yellow pages, etc."
3,for collectors,"This is a good book if you collect dollhouses (already made and furnished). There is great information on the history of dollhouses with sections highlighting examples from England, Germany, and America. Related topics, not always covered are here as well...dolls, plastic furniture, and metal work are included.I found the book to be a bit too technical to enjoy-kind of reminded me of a textbook. No roombox interiors are in this book."
3,Be Careful When Storing in your Trunk...,"Overall I was VERY satisifed with my bag of bones. The items are of good quality, solidly built and have held up well to the rigours typically associated with the day to day use of a bag of human bones.Where you're going to run into problems are:1) When the cops find them in your trunk. Lets just say that you should probably keep the receipt close by because trying to explain this away is ""difficult"".2)The girl you've been dating snoops around in your closet. The bag of human bones are a relationship speed bump to say the least.But, if your in the market for a bag of human bones, this is the product for you!"
2,"Bones smelled of old cheese, talk to me at dawn","I have been buying bags of human bones for over 22 years now and have always enjoyed that first moment when I rip open the bag and inhale the somber, musky smell of decay and sadness. Unfortunately for me and my neighbors: not so this time. The smell that erupted from the bag was unholy and not unlike curdled dairy or aged cheese... also: when the sun rises, these bones float over my bed as I lay in fear, trembling, and they speak to me by rapidly vibrating the molecules of my own skin.Other than these two issues, I have enjoyed the BONES1 bag of bones very much."
1,Great soup but all cans were severely dented,"I love this soup, so when my local Whole Foods stopped selling it, I turned to the web. I ordered a case of 12 cans from Amazon, but when they arrived, every can was really dented - the kind of beat-up can you would never buy if you saw it on a store shelf. BUYER BEWARE!"
3,A Good Intro to the subject,"I did learn a few new things about the land called Egypt but was distracted by the constant grammatical errors. Why can't authors or their editors learn English grammar and practice it in the pages of their work? I would now like to find a book about the subject with a little more meat and fewer unnecessary photos. This book is not as good as Graham Hancock's many works. I also wonder about the authenticity of the ""tour guide"", the harmonics, etc."
1,Not even good fiction,"Amazingly superficial and trivial. Proof that anyone can write a book, regardless of knowledge, ability or insight. Here's the formula: recall the work of others, name-drop the true researchers, get an Egyptian tour guide to be your ""mystic teacher"", give lots of personal opinions and beliefs, mention science but leave out facts, get a publishing 'friend' on the inside and presto-chango, financing for your next vacation to Egypt. Save your money on this one folks, it's a total waste."
4,"Great & Attractive Clock, but ....","Very accurate and attractive wall clock. I bought four of them a little over a year ago. Gave two away as gifts and kept the other two for my house. Of the two I kept, one of the second hands has ceased to function after approximately one year of service (tried changing the battery and that didn't fix it).Perhaps, La Crosse would be better served by leaving the second hand off clocks like this as I noted this issue being mentioned in some of the other reviews."
2,stopped working after 4 months,"Well, just as some of the other reviewers noted, this clock worked fine for about 4 months and then stopped for no apparent reason. If that's okay with you, then buy this clock. But if you don't like throwing money away, I would suggest trying a different one."
5,Quiet and distinguished looking,I needed a clock for my bathroom wall to provide an incentive to get ready faster (i've been habitually late to work b/c i get ready so slooowly in the morning- perhaps b/c i'm still 1/2 asleep when i get up at 5:30am =PI really like the color of the wood border and the fact that the clock is really quiet (my bedroom is 7 ft from the clock and I'm not kept awake by the annoying tick tock that other clocks make).I'm already thinking about buying another one especially since it qualifies for amazon's 4 for 3 offer!p.s. it's been 6 months since I purchased the clock and i'm still 5-10 min late into work - i guess i'm not a morning person!! (i end up staying 5-10 minutes later each day i'm late so its all relative).
2,Was nice while it lasted,"Bought this product Jun 2007. It was a classic looking clock that kept great time and never need adjusting. Until that is about 6 months ago. At which point it forgot which time zone it was in. Pressing the time zone button would cause the clock to reset itself but the hour was never correct. Replaced the battery with the same result. For $50, I expected a clock that would last longer than 18 months."
2,Pass on this one.,"I needed a decent clock for the living room to replace one that finally crapped out on me. I thought this one looks pretty good and is supposed to set itself - always a plus - but it was a letdown. Not only could it never set itself, the hands just kept going around and around until the battery wore down, but you couldn't even manually set it. It's operation is simple, as are the instructions, so it was definitely defective. I returned it for a refund and ended up with a cheaper clock of a different brand that has worked out fine."
3,the Seconds hand stopped working only a few months in,"I've had this clock for 2 years now- and the Seconds hand stopped working not long after I got it. I had already mounted it by then and thrown away the box so it was pointless to send back and I couldn't exchange.Otherwise has performed admirably for the 2 years I've had it- I never replaced the battery and I've never had to set the hands manually.The reason I'm writing this review is because a friend pointed out to me that I've essentially had a broken clock hanging on my wall for almost 2 years- which was a little more poignant.I am here both reviewing and debating whether I should risk buying another and risk the Seconds hand breaking again, or go to a Bulova one which costs 2x as much as is not Atomic."
2,Great when it works,This clock is great - when it works. It is highly erratic in being able to set and reset itself. Sometimes it just stalls completely. Other times it continuously scans the minute and second hand without ceasing. Looks fine from afar. Not a precision instrument!
2,Minute hand died this morning,"I've owned this clock for about three years. At first, I had to return two of them before the third one finally set itself correctly. This morning, the minute hand stopped, and no longer functions. It is a very, very cheaply made plastic clock with a thin ring of what may or may not be wood around the face."
2,Stopped working after 2 months,"Fist of all, atomic clocks do not access the Denver signal in Seattle and must be set manually.Second, the clock stopped working after 2.5 months and Amazon will not take a return after one month.I must admit that when it worked (after setting it manually) it was nice and also silent."
1,Does not work outside of PST to EST,"I chose this rating because there is no way to make it work in Alaska Standard Time. I have followed the instructions carefully and it displays the correct time for periods varying from 1 to 12 hours. As soon as the signal is received it reverts to PST.The on-line instructions mention 'programming' for different time zones, but fail to indicate how this would be done. There is no obvious provision for such programming on the clock, nor with the included setup instructions.Attempts to obtain advice by telephone resulted in long waiting times with a promise to return my call.The details supplied to Amazon did not mention this little difficulty.If one lives somewhere between San Francisco and New York, it would be a great clock.Otherwise, I would not recommend it."
4,Easy on the eyes,"I bought this for my mother, who has macular degeneration. She needs large, clear and crisp lettering, which this clock has. I have mounted it in her bathroom, and she really likes how it looks with the wood cabinetry. We were a little concerned that we might not be able to activate the automatic time synchronization, but a short stay in a west facing window did the trick. We have only had it a day or so, but at first blush, it is a very nice timepiece."
2,"Looks good, but quirky","I purchased this clock a few months ago. I live in San Jose, CA, and have it on a northwest-facing wall.Aesthetically, it looks good with the wood trim, but functionally it's a bit quirky. Most of the time it shows the correct time, but it often seems to get confused. The time can be off by 15 to 20 minutes, and the second hand seems to get stuck about halfway between the seven and eight. I'm not sure if it's busy receiving the radio data, or what.One possibility would be to try hanging it on a different wall, but I bought this clock for a specific location in my house, and was hoping for something dependable."
4,Good value for the money,"This clock fulfills a need I've had since my previous clock (a Regulator) died. Although it was slightly more expensive than I expected, its atomic clock feature (self-setting) was worth the additional price. It is on an interior wall of the house, and I live in the Dallas, Texas area, and it has no problem in synchronizing with the Colorado signal. If the battery has a long life, and the clock does too, I feel it will definitely fulfill my needs. (Also, it has a second hand, which my old clock did not.)Addendum, 3/12/08: The battery is still working fine, the clock set itself ahead for daylight saving time, and I am still pleased with it.Additional addendum, 3/24/10: The second hand has quit working. When, I don't remember. I did notice this about a year ago, and am just now (as I'm reviewing my reviews) adding this. (Coincidentally, it stopped at exactly the same position as in the picture of the product above.)"
3,The clock that was to have been,"I thought this clock would be perfect, alas it was not...when I unpacked the clock and followed the directions in setting it, the clock did not keep the right time.I returned the clock and chose not to have it replaced."
4,Pretty cool,"Once we figured out how to get this clock up and running, it was pretty cool to watch it set itself. It looks and runs great. With the real wood, the classy look, and the advanced technology this seems like a good value for the money."
4,"Nice clock, a little flaw","it is always nice clock. I had one in my kitchen, This is the second La Crosse Clock for us. We like it very much, just there is a little flaw on the wood part."
1,Stopped working,Bought this clock about a year ago. Last week we had a power outage and the clock stopped working entirely.
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"Well, it worked great for about a month. Then, it didn't automatically adjust for DST, so I tried to reset the time by pulling the battery. It then stopped working altogether -- apparently unable to pick up the time signal from the mother clock in Colorado. The manual time set feature didn't work so I had to take the clock from my office back to my home. After 3 days, it picked up the signal from home and ran fine. Then about 2 months later, it just quit working altogether. The hands reset to 12 and that's all she wrote. It won't reset and the manual time set feature has failed also. I would not buy another."
3,Second hand doesn't move,My clock has no issue at all syncing up and getting the time - the problem is that the second hand gets stuck and stops moving. I took the glass off and moved the second hand manually to the 12 position. Then I removed the battery out and re-inserted it. The clock synced up just fine and the second hand starting working so I was hoping it was problem solved. The next day I looked and once again it was stuck and not moving and it remains so today - so the clock appears to be defective. Aside from this issue I don't feel like the clock looks cheap as others have state. It is much better looking than other atomic clocks we own.
3,Not as good as expected,Two major problems:1. the second needle cannot accurately points to the numbers2. the curving plastic cover will reflect light no matter where you stand.
2,Takes too long to find a signal.,"Nice looking wall clock - keeps good time ... when it finally finds it. Took almost a week to lock in when I bought it (come on - is Los Angeles that remote?) and now that daylight savings time ended, it still hasn't locked in to the correct time 5 days later. For an ""atomic"" clock, this thing is anything but space age in it's operation. The instructions tell you to put the clock facing west, keep it away from appliances, be sure the battery is fresh, put it on a window sill at night, be patient for 3-5 days, etc. Please. It's a clock, for crying out loud - not a tomato garden. I'll give it a couple more days to figure out what time it is - and then I'll put it in the trash ... facing west."
2,La Crosse Replaced Clocks with Bad DST,"Many LaCrosse clocks are plagued with bad reviews on how the DST doesn't work. A couple of online forums also discuss DST not working for LaCrosse clocks. Mine synchronizes fine with normal time, but has NOT yet synchronized with DST. Totally worthless now as an atomic clock. If LaCrosse doesn't offer an exchange or fix, the clock will have to end up in the garbage. Other than the DST issue clock has been very accurate.Update: La Crosse sent out new clocks to replace the ones that did not adjust for DST because of the new date changes. Any company that does this is tops in my book. Changing rating to five stars."
5,Works perfectly - if you live in the right area,"The short of it is that this clock performs its job quite admirably. You insert a single AA battery and then press on one of four buttons on the back to tell it whether you are Eastern Time, Central Time, Mountain Time, or Pacific Time. Wait a bit - mine received a signal about 3 minutes later, some people have to wait overnight. It receives radio signals from Colorado and it will readjust itself nightly to keep near perfect time. It will also factor in Daylight Savings Time. These it does well - and so it gets 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do.However, if you live in the east coast, you must recognize that you are farther away from the radio source. This clock may not be able to set itself unless, for example, placed near a window. This is NOT a fault of the clock, but rather a limitation of the radio waves.Otherwise, the clock seems well made, the wood looks real, and the numbers are easy to read from a distance."
2,If you like to get a headache changing these for non-us time zones,I have disliked these clocks since the first time I have had to change for daylight savings time. Sometimes it would take two days for the clock to autoadjust. Then if you adjust the clock manually you need some thing really small to hold the button down and try to hold while you look at the clock. They are a pain. I put up with them for two years and one just died. They are all going in the trash. Waste of money.
5,Good for large room,This is the second one I have bought; first for my kitchen and second for present. My daughter liked it and asked me to buy one for her husband for his office. It's nice not to have to change the clock hands when DST begins and ends.
1,Worked great for a week,It was a bit difficult to start--took about 12 hours. It kept perfect time for 5 days then just stopped. It was correct to the exact second when it worked. Tried a new battery but nothing happened. A very disappointing product.
2,LASTED 5 YEARS,"After 5 years, it kept spinning and would not stop. Another one I bought at the same time would not work in my house, but worked in the neighbor's house who I gave it to."
5,Satisfied,"The clock is very lightweight. However, it did exactly what the directions/instructions said it would do. I did NOT have to do anything but put a battery in it and hang it on the wall. It was ""amazing"" to watch it set it itself. I am satisfied."
2,Try Something Else!,"Bought this about 2 yrs ago. I live in Florida and it was never able to set to the Denver signal, so I manually set it. Recently for no particular reason it started to cycle and wouldn't stop. Replaced several batteries. Continues to cycle (hunt for NIST signal) and will not allow manual reset. Clock is kaput."
5,Great design,"This is a very well made clock. It is easy to see from far away, shows correct time within minutes of setup, no more climbing up to set the Daylight Savings Time or remembering how many minutes the clock is off. A quick test showed that clock's time about 2 seconds different from my Verizon cell phone.Good product."
1,LaCrosse Analog Atomic Clock,"I ordered two LaCrosse 12-inch mahogany colored wood analog atomic clocks. They are beautiful, but I had problems with both of them. One didn't work at all and had to be returned. The other one only picks up the required radio signal if the clock is directly facing a westerly window even though the instructions suggest that the radio signals penetrate walls (except in the middle of large buildings). My house is not a large building and when I put the clock on a wall that faces north for four days, but it wouldn't set itself. On the fourth day I moved it to the east wall of the same room (facing a western window) and it set itself, but that's not where I want the clock!! I've decided to keep the clock (on the north-facing wall) knowing that the time is not being updated daily and will be no more accurate than any other clock in the house...disappointing, since I was looking forward to setting all my other clocks and watch from that one."
1,Stay away from this clock,"The clock stopped working in 3 months. The manufacturer confirmed that there is a defect in the design. They sent me another one for replacement. But, again it broke in 2 months. I am not going to contact the manufactures anymore since it will take a long time (1 month) for them to send you a replacement and cost me $10 in shipping."
5,Works fine in S.E. Michigan,"We got the clock, read the instructions, installed a battery and hung it on an East / West wall. After the sun went down, the clock was able to receive the station and set itself to the correct time. It has worked flawlessly for the last two months since we got it. It's nice to have the correct time all the time and the kids don't worry about getting out on time to catch the bus because the clock is off."
1,worked at first but broke in 2 weeks,"Seemed to work fine at first. After 2 weeks, the hour and minute hands keep constantly adjusting to a time, and I mean, constantly 24/7. Essentially, I have a spinning dial that may be an amusing thing for kids but doesnt tell any time at all times (pun intended). I am going back to a good old fashioned analog wall clock."
5,Atomic Clock,"I love my new atomic clock I bought from Amazon.com. At first I didn't know how to set it, but once I put in the battery time flew by literally until it came to rest at the exact time. All I had to do was set the time zone I live in. It keeps perfect time even during power outages."
5,easy to read in the morning,"We have put the clock in the bathroom so we can stay on track during the quick ""get ready"" time. We like the big numbers (easy for the kids to read and sleepy parents.) Glad we found the part in the instruction page to leave it by a window to set correct time."
2,Not accurate?,"I've had this clock for a couple of weeks now. Usually, it appears to be correct, but every now and then, it's 20 minutes slow. I manually reset the time, and it will be perfect for a few days, then it will be 20 minutes slow again. Strange."
1,"Frustrating, no good","Every midnight, in spite of every attempt to correct it, our clock reverted to Mountain time. We eventually returned it, after considerable frustration. The company was no help."
1,Does not work!,"Yes it finds the time automatically, problem is just not sure which time zone it was finding. It certainly wasn't mine. Could not get it to stay on my time zone manually. Would not buy this product. You get what you pay for. Returned it. they told me it could take up to ten days for it to find the correct time zone. It never did."
5,Amazin atomic Clock,This is fantastic clock that does not need winding and of course it is state-of-the art in clocks. The wood frame looks great on my wall.
5,La Crosse Technology WT-3122A 12 1/2-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock,"I love it! It works perfectly. For once in my life, I know what the ACTUAL time is. I cannot understand why anyone in the USA would ever buy a clock that they have to set themselves."
3,Good but...,"Clock works well and keeps time, but like some reviewers have mentioned - the second had doesn't move at all. Not really a problem, my annoying anyway."
4,Nice big clock and Nice looking,"I couldn't get it to set itself, like it says it should. It had been very overcast and that might have played a part. But the clock is very nice looking and feels real solid. It's large and looks beautiful in my kitchen. It's nice enough to put in any room in the house or office. It's keeping good time, it's quiet and it's easy to read. If it updates itself, that will be an added plus. But I'd like it just for the clock it is at the price it's selling for."
1,Clock goes crazy,"Very hard to get the clock pickup signal and set by itself. Also, does not change when daylight savings time change. That's the main reason I need an automic clock. I had to go through the same excercise of setting the time for the first time. There is no way to manually set the time either. Clock looks good, but just not worth the hassle.Update: All of a sudden clock goes haywire and start spinning crazy. It does not stop until you pull the battery out. Took out the battery to stop the clock, and inserted it back and clock sets itself in the night. Again clock goes crazy and starts spinning non-stop next day or few days later. This is beeing reported by other reviewers also. One of the reviewer has posted a video. Finally I got tired and just threw away the clock!"
3,Traps for young players,"As a clock, the La Crosse Atomic Clock does what it is meant to do--keep the time, with an analogue display--and looks good while it is at it. The book of the words does state unequivocally that the automatic radio time check works only in (most of) the 48 States, and not in Europe or Asia. What it doesn't say, however, is that, in the absence of the broadcast time check, the clock stops at about 12 o'clock for about an hour in the middle of both the day and the night, and then restarts shortly after one o'clock with a quick circuit of the dial by both hands. The upshot of this is that it provides excellent time keeping, but only for about 11/12ths of the day--an eccentric approach to temporal information. I would not recommend purchase of this clock--and its close relatives--for use outside the USA, but within the Staes, go for it."
5,Exactly what I as looking for,"I was looking for a clock for the fellowship hall at our church. This one is large enough to be seen from anywhere in the room, and the face is clear and uncluttered so it's easy to read. I as a bit confused at first about how it was going to set itself, but followed the directions and by the next day it was automatically set to the right time! The wooden frame is beautiful and enhances our decor. Very pleased!"
1,Worst design ever!!! Don't buy!,"My clock always gives wrong time and the design is very bad.1. This clock always stops at midnight and waits for the 4:00am radio signal to restart. That means there are 4 hours in a day (0 to 4 am) it doesn't give the right time.2. When it adjusts itself at night, it makes big noise that will wake you up.3. There is no way to turn off the self-adjustment function. If your location can not receive good radio signal, the clock is useless. It depends on the radio too much.4. At last, a clock doesn't need to adjust itself everyday if it is accurate enough."
1,I'll Try Another Brand Next Time,This clock was delivered in May of '08. It stopped working before the end of August.
2,never worked quite right,My prior kitchen clock lasted 20 years. This one never worked reliably (it would randomly reset itself) and then stopped working completely in 18 months. I do not recommend it at all.
4,Atomic Clock makes keeping time easy,This large atomic clock is perfect in the kitchen. The receiver is sensitive enough to access WWV from an inside wall.
3,"Execellent contrsuction, calibrations slightly off","The quality of construction is very good. However, I have three other atomic clocks where the seconds hand are all in sync and point to markings around the clock. This clock is always seven seconds ahead. Also on each tick the seconds hand does not point exactly at a marking on the face (e.g. points to the middle between minute markings). Same with the minutes hand. When the seconds hand is point to 12 the nimutes hand points between two miniute markings."
3,Looks nice but...,I got this to replace a clock that had stopped running. it looks nice and is suapposed to set the time automatically. Well it doesn't. Even after repeated attempts to reset it it does not automatically set the correct time. otherwise it works fine.
3,Beautiful clock! But,"It's a really beautiful, well-made wooden frame clock, but it's not picking up the analog signal in Canton, Ohio. Therefore, it does not self-correct. I decided to keep the clock because of it's appearance, to avoid the hassle of returning, etc.Update: After moving the clock to a different part of the house, now it picks up the signal and keeps correct time. But it makes annoying noise whenever needles spin around to correct time... waking me up a few times in the middle of the night. It corrects time at 2 am (and you have no choice) and woke me up. I had to move the clock out of the bedroom... but okay to use it elsewhere."
5,Handles day light time switch flawlessly,"I own two atomic clocks, so I know not all atomic clocks work as well as Crosse Technology.This clock is attractive, keeps time well, adjusts itself as necessary, and most importantly takes care of day light savings without any problems.My other clock fights me twice a year when the day light change happens - it often takes me several days to convince it to keep the right time. This is never the case with Crosse Technology - it just works!"
4,"Works, looks good.","It works well for me in Central IL, the numbers are a good size for reading across the room, and I like how it looks. The face is a clean design, with the brand and ""radio controlled"" in a small enough print to not be distracting. The frame is a nice dark wood that matches my door- and windowframes.The second hand does tick, but it's not terribly loud, and I find it soothing. It does *not* have a smooth-sweep second hand, if that's what you're looking for."
4,Nice Accurate Clock,I have purchased several analog atomic clocks. The minute hand on all of them have always been a little off. This clock is no exception. The difference is very minor. The most it is off is only about a quarter of a minute.The wood finish looks fake when viewed up close but from a distance you would never know.The lens is convex so it reflects room lights which can interfere with viewing the clock.I had no trouble getting the time signal overnight and as of this date have not tested the switch from daylight saving time but I am not anticipating any problems.I think it is an excellent clock and very accurate and worry free.
3,"looks good, small glitch","this is a good looking clock - and I like the automation thing, it has had no problem acquiring the time signal - however, even tho I live in the Eastern zone, I had to set this to Pacific time to get it to set itself correctly. So it's a good thing I don't actually live in another US timezone, because it would be 1-3 hours off."
1,Died under first year,"Rubbish. PLEASE save the aggravation. Had trouble the first time getting time, died on month 11. Rubbish. There are better clocks out there, this is not one of them."
2,Item came broken!,"This item was purchased as a wedding gift for a friend. Only recently did I discover that the clock came broken when it was delivered. My friend quietly requested for a replacement which she did get, but I was still very disappointed by how the excitement of opening a new gift was ruined by poor handling. Otherwise, I hear that the quality of the clock itself isn't bad, but that just might be my friend being polite."
1,Do Not Buy This Clock!,"Like a lot of the other reviews, my clock went bad after three months. When communicating with the company, they first kept claiming my batteries were bad. Also, push this button 20 times, stick a wire hanger in this hole, ... Like a game of twister! Finally they asked me to return it and I should pay for shipping and to make sure it was insured! That would almost cost me the same as the stupid clock! Avoid a nightmare and do not purchase this model. My hands just keep going round and round, and the clock doesn't keep time. I have better things to do than pull the battery every day and restart the clock."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,I bought this wall clock because the reviews were pretty good and I liked the design. When I got it and put a battery in and the clock just kept turning and turning and never recognized the ET. I was so excited to have a atomic clock thinking I will never have to adjust the daylight savings time. That dream was gone in 30 sec. Very dissapointed.
1,Don't Buy,This clock stoped working 9 months after I purchased it. need to send it back to China... don't waste your time or money on it...
2,La Cross WT-3122a 12 1/2 inch wooden atomic a logo clock,"I bought this clock looking forward to having a very accurate clock, with auto adjustment. But that only works in the USA.It does not work in the uk, picking up the signal from Rugby, therefore it is just an expensive quartz clock here and will not auto adjust. Disappointed, to say the least!"
3,I bought 4 of these clocks - yes 8 total clocks,We purchased 4 of this style clock for our office. Upon arrival 3 were in excellent shape but one had gotten broken in shipment. Of the 3 - I installed the battery and hit the EST button on the back and they all moved to 4:00. But it was 2:15 PM. Okay - I'll give it overnight to sinc up. No Go. Moved them to a different office that faced the right direction to sinc up. They did finally after 2 days. We returned the damaged product and a new one shipped immediately to replace it. Excellent service on Amazon's part. Overall would recommend the clock. It is nice when all have the same time on them that is correct.
1,WeatherBuffs needs to get real about shipping cost,"I was looking forward to purchasing this item until I got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost. The cheapest shipping would run me 14.99 for an item costing 21.89. Sorry WeatherBuffs, you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price.UPDATE: At the time this item shipped from an amazon associated seller not from amazon itself and thus the shipping cost. It appears that now you can purchase this item and get it shipped from amazon directly."
1,AWFUL - DO NOT BUY,"I am finally throwing this away - beware - atomic resetting doesn't work and there is NO MANUAL OVERRIDE on this clock. Buy a clock where you can adjust the time, and DO NOT rely on the clock to reset correctly."
2,dirty,it came a ripped up package. the clock was dirty on the inside of the glass the glass was also scratches
2,The second hand will stop--guaranteed--,"I bought at least 6 of the la-crosse clocks. I was so happy because it was so reliable in regards to fall-back and spring-forward problems. Until i dropped one by accident while changing the battery. The second hand stopped working, but it is still working otherwise. The problem is it happened 2 more times on the other 2 clocks. Same thing happened, the second hands stopped. I think you need to be extra careful, because if you drop it, the second hand will surely stop. The good thing was it happened to the smaller clocks--they were just for my bedrooms."
3,This clock simply does not work,"This clock looks handsome, just what we wanted for the kitchen. However, we've received both our original order and a replacement and neither worked. It's supposed to set the time by satellites passing by. This is supposed to take all night. The first clock simply stopped shortly after we set it up to set the time. After that, it would not even try to set the time. We returned it for a replacement. The replacement is still continuously trying to set the time after an entire week. There are directions for setting the time manually. They simply do not work on either clock. The manufacturer has a technical support phone number. No one answered our calls. Do yourself a favor: Don't buy this clock."
5,AWESOME CLOCK,"While painting the kitchen, the clock slipped and the frame around it broke.ThoughtWal-Mart would be the answer... yuck NO...So, looked on-line, and found this beautiful clock, that is a perfect (better) replacement for what I had.It is a beautiful wood frame, and a great accent to the new colors in my kitchen !! THANKS !!"
2,Second hand stopped,After one week the second hand stopped. Otherwise the clock works and syncs accurately to the radio time standard signal.
5,"Stylish, classic clock","We have three of these clocks and are very pleased. We especially like the fact that they are easy to see, make no noise, are very accurate and never need setting, even with daylight savings time. Plus, there are several wood colors to match your decor. A good, solid clock."
4,I only have to remember to change batteries,I like the atomic analog clock because I only have to remember to change the batteries.La Crosse Technology WT-3122A 12 1/2-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock
4,good device,I purchased this clock and put a battery in it and it started to run automatically. I thought that was it. It should find the right time. But it did not work that way. It stopped sometimes and ran constantly somtimes. So I wanted to return it. Then I tried the manual ajustment in the back of the clock and set it at the right time. Since then it has worked perfectly. There was no instruction in the package. I would get it right at the first time if there was an instruction booklet.
1,clock is problematic,"Ordered one quit working first couple of days. So i replaced it the second clock keeps time but a few days after i received it the second hand quit turning, its keeping time so far, will see. This product seems cheaply made.....La Crosse Technology WT-3122A 12 1/2-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock"
5,Great Clock,"Well, there's not a whole lot you can say about a wall clock except that it looks good, runs good and meets all my expectations. Start up and setting is simple and I receive a strong radio signal at night to maintain accuracy. I'm well pleased with this purchase."
1,Wonderment,This is amazing.....it doesn't work. I am so surprised. We can't get it to take a signal. Have tried for days. Too much interference? Other than that it is a beautiful clock. Am sending it back
4,La Crosse Atomic Clock,"Item was received on time, and the product was as advertised. Price not the greatest, but item well worth the money. Clock very accurate."
5,Clocks for Africa,"We purchased two 12 1/2 inch Wood Atomic Analog Clocks for my son and daughter in law when they go to Mosembique, Africa as missionaries. The idea of using two was to give them the time in Denver, where they are from, and also the time in Africa. They loved the fact that the clock faces were large so they could be easily seen. Also the quality of the clocks is outstanding with the rich wood around the edge of the clocks and the large numbers. They will certainly be an impressive part of their home.When we purchase from Amazon we are confident that Amazon's products are just as they are written up online. We can always trust their quality.Joni Terpstra"
2,Two Returns!,"I already have a clock just like this and wanted another. The new one came and would NOT set itself to the correct time. Instead of starting out at 12, 4 or 8, it started at 1 and then was always an hour ahead. I tried setting it manually and it still didn't work. So I ordered a replacement and it just arrived with a broken face. That's the last time I'll order this clock on line! Now I have two clocks to return!"
2,would not connect to signal,The clock would not connect to signal center in Colorado. Tried it in different areas of apt and in another residence. Returned clock because of this reason.
1,It NEVER worked!,"I purchased this clock with great anticipation, and followed all the directions. Facing West, etc etc etc. It never worked! i would never order an atomic clock again!"
1,LaCrosse is junk. 4 out of 5 clocks I bought are non-functional.,"Out of five LaCrosse clocks I bought last year, only one is still working. One stopped entirely after a few weeks. On another the second hand stopped working after about three months. I even bought a LaCrosse travel alarm that no matter what I did, would re-set itself to Pacific time every 24 hours (I'm on Eastern). The last straw was one that worked great for a year, but this week when I replaced the battery the hands would not stop spinning. After two days of continuous spinning I took it down and threw it away. By the way there is no real wood on this clock. The case is solid brown plastic, not even wood grain.The fifth clock is working OK, but I'll never buy another LaCrosse product. Who needs aggravation from a wall clock??"
3,Just Fine... Its a clock,A little hard to understand the instructions for the set up. But I got it and it has been working great.
5,Radio feature does not work [correction: IT DOES WORK],"This is a nice clock but the radio feature does not work. The main reason I bought this clock was for the radio feature. If I just wanted a nice clock without radio time-setting, I could have spent half the cost of this one.Update: After trying for days to get the radio feature to work, I gave up and wrote the comments above. I kept the clock and believed it was functioning as a regular clock. Imagine my surprise the night of the Daylight Saving Time change when suddenly the clock made a whirring sound and the hands went completely around as it automatically adjusted to the new time. So I would like everyone to know that my original review was incorrect."
3,Great...when it works,"I have three of these clocks, purchased at various times over the past few years. Within the past month, the newest one has suddenly started advancing the time...the hands just go round and round at high speed. This has been going on for days--removing the battery and reinstalling has no effect. The second hand on my 2nd clock has ceased to move...although the clock still displays accurate time. The third is still working fine for now.My conventional battery operated clocks at home have worked for years and years and years (of course, I have to set them at least twice/year)."
2,Worked fine until the batery died,We were very happy with these clocks and bought two of them. They worked fine until the battery died and we had to change it. It never recovered and couldn't keep time even to the correct hour. I'm looking for better version of this clock as my wife is a time fanatic.
3,Misleading display advertising.,"I would normally rate a La Crosse Technology Time piece, and other instruments 5 Stars, But because the display list it as having a wood frame, when in fact it appears to be plastic, or plastic coated wood. I would have rated it 1 Star but I gave it 3 stars for an average. One would have to scratch the frame to determine if it's not plastic. To my observations if it looks like plastic, it is plastic."
1,Doesn't work. Do not buy.,"This is the WORST product I ever bought. Returned it promptly. Simply doesn't work in my house in San Diego. Not only it will not sync automatically to atomic time but will not allow manual setting to use it as a regular non-atomic clock. The Company is so lousy that their own manual doesn't match the product, describing non existing buttons and not describing existing ones such as ""wave"" and ""set"". Furthermore their video doesn't match the manual nor the actual product. What a joke."
1,Clock is possessed!,"Like some of the other reviewers of this clock that gave it 1 - 2 stars, I have encountered the same issues as they have. I placed a battery in it and pressed the ""PT"" (I live in San Jose, CA) and thought it would adjust to the correct time overnight. It never did! So I manually set it and had to re-set it many times since it seems to think it knows what time it is! But the time is always incorrect. I put up with it since Jan 2006 and when Day Light savings came in Nov 2008, it just went crazy. Kept going in circles and no way to stop it unless I removed the battery. So I gave up and tossed it in the dumpster. Only reason I gave this 1 star is the looks. It's a nice looking wall clock. It needs a manual override since I found the atomic auto set-up severely flawed. I paid $25, now its $19 here on Amazon. Just a buyer beware!"
1,This is a great looking thimg,Nice looking thing to hang on the wall but of you want one of those clock thingies that will show you the time look eksewhere.When I set it for my tinezone (p) it sets itself to 2 hr. 35 min. slow. My other atomic clock has been working just fine for over 16 years no matter where in my humble little abode I put it so its not for lack of a signal. Guess I ill judt get myself a calendar.
1,Doesn't work,"Ok, it has the minute correct, but it was around 4 hours behind the actual time. I tried to manually correct it and it just rolled back to being wrong overnight. Just get a regular wall clock, this is not worth the agravation."
3,Elegant,I have this beautiful clock placed in my family room and it really added beauty to the room and house
4,"If you've got the money, you've got the time.","I now have four of these clocks. It's nice to know each one shows the same time and it's the exact time. (You know the battery is getting low when the second hand stops sweeping. Replace it and you're good to go.) Ticks a little loud, but not too bad. 4.5 stars."
4,Excellent Clock,This clock is exactly what I was looking for. An easy to read clock face with the accurate time always.I have it in the kitchen so I can easily see how late I am going to be.
2,Broken,"Clock had obviously been previously returned. Packaging was damaged & had parts missing. Clock itself was damaged (clock mechanism was no longer attached to back of clock, hands swung freely) and had probably been dropped. Return and refund was prompt and easy, no questions asked, but I didn't bother to reorder. Very disappointed, as the clock actually looked nice."
2,Great Clock Until it Goes Crazy,"We bought this clock several years ago and loved it. It worked perfectly for almost 4 years. Then it reset itself to run four hours late. After a few days, it reset itself to run three hours early. So we replaced it with a new but identical clock. That one came out of the box already crazy. It cannot set itself to the right time. If we try to do it manually, it resets itself either forward or back. I give two stars only because the first clock did run for several years."
4,I Like It,"When I first put in the battery, the clock started and went to 12 and sat there. I thought now I am stuck, the reviewers who had trouble were right and I shoulda listened to them but after pushing reset, taking the battery out and in and starting to stratigize how I am going to get my money back it went to the correct time and has been keeping time since.psNothing but perfection gets five stars and nobody's perfect."
4,La Cross Atomic Clock works but won't sync,I ordered this clock to replace a Walmart clock that sucked batteries dry in two months. Delivery went from 29 June to 2 July and finally received 3 July. It didn't sync to the Colorado station initially so I placed it in an upstairs window facing East (I'm in CA) and it still didn't sync. So I manually set it and will hope it stays accurate. My wife likes the numbers and the wood trim.
4,Good Clock,"What more do you want in a clock? This is an atomic , radio set clock so its the exact time always. The wood is ok , but would have picked a lighter color if available."
3,Won't get another atomic clock.,I bought my atomic clock in 2008. It died short of 4 years. I think wall clocks should last longer then that. My next clock will be a cheapy clock that will probably last 10+ years. Then if I want to know the exact time I'll check the Internet.
3,Not good for viewing from a distance,This clock is attractive and it did eventually find the atomic clock signal (though twice required the reset sequence to get that to happen). It is surprisingly difficult to read from across a none-too-large room. The numbers are smaller than they seem at first glance and apparently the contrast is not optimal through the plastic cover. Would be fine if needed for viewing at 10 feet or less.
2,Turned out not to be great....only lasted 3 months.,"Great clock so far. It didn't set the first time we put the battery in, but by morning it was automatically set. We are using it for our pool area so its exposed to different weather and seems to still be working just fine. Would definitely purchase again.Update: 3 months after ordering, the clock quit working. I sent it back to Amazon and so far not getting a full refund (-$ 6.54 for a restocking fee?). Won't order this clock again and may not be ordering from Amazon again depending on whether I get my full refund back or not. Will let you know....."
1,"Cheap, Unreliable","I bought this hoping it would be easy. I didn't want to set the clock for daylight savings time. Thisclock is very attractive, but is not dependable. It will set itself at strange times to an odd time. This happens during thunderstorms, but other times as well. I bought this 6 months ago for my wife and I cannot recommend it. We have had to manually set it about once a month.UPDATE:La Crosse replaced the unit, no problems with that. The new unit seems to keep time, but the second handis stuck at 37 seconds."
3,Perfect Until Otherwise,"It works really really fine for a year and a half. And then no matter what battery I feed it, it behaves as if the battery is dead and jumps two scale every two seconds and then stops forever. Feel sad it died too young."
3,Works but looks cheap,"I bought this as a gift. It says it is wood, but it is plastic made to look like wood. It looks cheap to me.I am told that it works well."
1,I'm sure it's a fine clock but $12 shipping on a $20 item is a little much,"This is the kind of clock I wanted, but when I ordered I saw that shipping was around $12, about 60% of the product cost. That's a little out of kilter, don't you think? So I cancelled my order."
1,Goodbye small business,"Wow Amazon, way to drive down margins to nothing. I grew up supported by a family business that sold and repaired clocks. This pricing drives everyone else out of business. Quality of clocks decrease, and small businesses close their doors. Before you jump on me with ""that's economics"", stop and consider what we are losing. Would you like to see the clock? Too bad. Would you like to hear other clock's chimes? Too bad. Want to hear expert opinions? I'm sure Amazon knows and will answer your questions, expert clockmakers that they are. How about when you need repairs? Too bad indeed. Thanks to Chinese manufacturers and Amazon, we can just dump the broken clock in a landfill and buy a new one. Before you buy this, consider supporting your local Clock Shop. It is good for the community, it's good for America, and it will ultimately be best for you the consumer."
5,e-commerce.....in plain english.....6 stars,"Here is the essential bible for all involved in e-marketing, a masterpiece. If you are still scared of opening ""the door of opportunity"" into the 21st Century, contact me, we'll do it together."
3,New way of doing things,"I have read this book last week and take around 2 days to finish it.I have found point which threathen my current position.This because future direction it more towards virtual or wireles transition which enable computer to perform all the task.For instance nowsdays the revolution of the ""E"", i.e E-Commerce,E-Learning..etc takes almost all the conventional way of doing things."
1,DREAM-BIZ.COM,"I only have a couple of points regarding this ""book"". First, why wait until 3/4 of the way thru the book to drop the name ""Amway""? I found this to be in line with the way all ""Amway"" followers do business. It was very ""sneaky"" to say the least. Second. The author compares Henry Fords starting of Ford Motors with Quixtar? First of all, Ford is a publicly traded company. You can buy stock in Ford where as Quixtar ie. Amway is not. So the author failed to make a correct comparison. In all I found many things wrong with the information in this book. But if all you are looking for is a commercial for Amway then you will be pleased with the sermin this book is filled with. As for myself. If I want a motivational tool it will not consist of any alternative motives such as selling its readers on a business which has seen a 28% decline in the past two years."
1,Hard Green,For an in depth analysis of the public relations industry that Huber represents and how they attempt to shape public opinion and law read _Trust Us We're Experts: How Industry Manipulates Science and Gambles with Your Future_ by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber...
2,Could have been so much better.,"I was disappointed by this book. It was short on verifiable facts, repetitive on assertions, and in some places just mean spirited. I expect more from an attorney/engineer. If the arguements had been fully developed it could have been a much better piece of work. As it stands - I do not reccomend it."
3,Hard Green: A Political Study,"This book is about politics, not environmentalism. At that, it is a week assault on Gore's environmentalism, consisting of polemics rather than a thoughtful policy analysis.If you are interested in learning about current and important environmental trends, environmental science, or environmental policy analysis, then 'Hard Green' is NOT the book for you.If, however, you goal is to learn how conservatives go about trying to discredit Gore's environmental policy, then reading 'Hard Green' is a MUST!Ben Harkema, President of Millennialtrust.com, LLC."
2,HARD GREEN ... A BOOK TOO LONG,"Hard Green is an advocacy worth reading, but after the first 30 pages or so the author gets repetitive and does so for the entire 204 pages of the book. Its like the same theme written over and over."
2,"Excellent Concept, Lacks Substantiation","I really wanted to read a contrarian environmental view, either to improve my own environmentalism or just to clarify the issues. Huber's concepts were aimed at the right target, misguided environmental policy - his own idea is using recovered land as the ultimate goal of our policies - but I was gravely disappointed by his lack of supporting data."
1,Unsubstantiated Rhetoric,"Being a conservative, I have been looking for a good book to support the conservative environmental cause. ""Hard Green"" is NOT that book. Peter Huber falls into the same trap as Al Gore's ""Earth in the Balance"" ... Unsubstantiated Rhetoric. Save your money and more importantly your time."
1,More of the same will NOT save us.,"We consumed our way into our current mess and it is the height of folly to believe we can consume our way out of it. Privatization (read commodification)is definitely not the answer. The reason the author comes to the conclusions he does is that it is just too difficult for him to give up his current lifestyle. Showing us that recycling doesn't work is easy. Recycling is what happens when we commodify something like garbage, so let's commodify everything and that will solve our other problems just as effectively. Read 'Divided Planet' if you want a really well written book on the subject."
3,redundant green,"The arguments made for the superiority of a market approach to environmental protection are good and largely persuasive. However, I found the same arguments made over and over as I read rather than additional development of the arguments and I got tired of the book before the end. I also found the author's polemical style got in the way of his arguments."
2,Not Correct,"Mr. Huber has many flaws in this book, the first one is about his so called hero Teddy. He was not a conservative Republican, he was a populist progressive. He believed in helping the simple man, that is why him and Taft were know as trust-busters. Also, conservation for American forest were conserved not just to keep them in the same state for other generations, but Teddy followed a philosophy of utilitarian environmentalism. This is where he believed that forest and wilderness should be conserved for future use. He believed that the future should have a chance to exploit the resources he left behind. This is why you have the Parks and Wildlife Department working hand in hand with timber companies, not against."
1,Hard Groans,"the author is more often long on strident rhetoric, and too often short on solid research, rigorous analysis and fact checking. While encouraged by his recognition of the wilderness scarcity problem facing the planet, I was put off by his powerful intellect settling in all the other chapters for facile arguments unencumbered by the real complexities we face. Perhaps worth reading from the library, but not worth buying."
2,Read Carefully,"I have read a few of Huber's essay's concerning the environment. Many of his arguments have merit, many of them don't. Anyone who has limited knowledge of biology or ecology would not be able to make the distinction between his good and bad arguments. If you are a laymen in terms of biology, ecology, chemistry, etc., it would be better to choose a book with less bias, or couple the book with one written from the other side of the argument."
3,give me a break,"Look, this is a smart guy, and he has caught environmentalists in some terrific contradictions. But he's also a teensy bit facile in jumping to his conclusions. He glibly dismisses the idea that storing radioactive waste is a problem-- it clearly is, and there is a connection to be made between a need for nuclear power and the appetite for huge SUV's. Why can't efficiency, and husbanding of resources, be counted?He doesn't really provide much comfort to conservatives-- he wants to protect old-growth forests, he feels the majesty of the rain forest, he loves wetlands, and he wants the oceans kept clean. Really, at the end of the day, Huber's got no real constituency left-- he's alienated the whole spectrum. I hope he fools a lot of conservatives into spending their money on this book, because they could definitely learn something."
5,only cost me a penny,"Although these Micheloe Rotel Dvds seem to be outdated, They are they best workout dvds I have ever used. Soto see that they are still in print is great especaillywhen they only cost 1 cent. Really this is something I cannot live without. Thanks"
1,Evil.,"It was so loud that I had to go and sleep in my son's room. Plus it didn't even cool my 160' square room. I had to take it back, at considerable pain to my back. Don't buy this!"
2,This was boring,"This was an extremely boring anime. Nothing even mildly interesting or funny happened, it is the anime equivalent of ""Garfeild"" an immensly popular series that lacks any entertaining aspect whatsoever. Apparently there is a difference between Japanese and American cultures, this difference is that in Japan, lame humor is laughed at, Lame crap like this could never be made in the US, at least not without a laugh-track."
5,I luv Azumanga Daioh !^^,"Eventhough im in the kind of serious and mysterious anime, there's also the lighter side of me!^^ Azumanga Daioh has become one of my favorite action/comedy animes ever! I saw the first episode in the coolest magazine ever called Newtype!I laughed out loud! This anime is about these high school girls(and one 10 year old girl)and their days in high school (yup we know how it is!)anyway its about these girls at school and well, its soo funny and sure it may sound like a dumb plot but seriously it isnt! I would also like to recomend . Hack//Sign if you want a little more mystery and action! but those of us who wanna lol, go ahead, you know u wanna read or Watch AZUMANGA DAIOH!^^ (but if you're not sure go grab a copy of the April release of Newtype with the the Azumanga Daioh girls on the front cover!) hurry!^^ remember, this is Animefreak!"
3,Warning: only for a light-hearted time filler.,"Azumanga Daioh is basically trying to be a funny portrayal of everyday experiances, but it definatly not as good as I expected.Each episode is divided into segmants- each about a seperate funny experiance. The laughs are funny but few really make you laugh out loud, and sometimes there is such a long gap between gags that you lose interest. One segmant revolves around Osaka having hiccups and all the girls suggesting differant ways to cure them and it becomes very repeditive: hiccup, try cure, hiccup, try cure, hiccup, try cure... you get my point.My 12 year-old sister enjoyed it but even she got bored after awhile.The dvd comes with some nice extras though. A reversable cover and a very good 12 page booklet (explaing some Japanese culture relevent to the episodes)In conclusion I would only recommend 'Azumanga Daioh' to people seeking a VERY light-hearted laugh and nothing serious at all.(...)"
3,Great when working,"It is great when it is working, but it is very difficult to get the receiver sync'ed with the transmitter that is connected to the TV. Not having instructions does not help either!! Once it is sync'ed, it works very well. Just hope the power does not go out."
3,No instructions or warranty???,Cool Idea but they really need to put some instructions in the dang box. I can pretty much figure out how to hook it up but is would be nice to have the instructions. Warranty would be good too.
2,Not so great,These pans are made of thin tin - I don't expect them to hold up over the years. I would spend a little more money for a more durable pan.
3,VERY early Alice Faye!,"A very early film, thought to be lost, showcases Alice Faye in typical role---however she seems somewhat uneasy in this film, not her usual relaxed and in control self. The film is certainly not the quality of her later films, and the story line is a bit jerky and often comes to a stop. The DVD has passable video and sound, but this is not a film you will be wanting to see over and over!!Best part is at end, when Alice sings----"
4,LOST CLASSIC!!!!!,"Given that this was the only surviving print of this film, I can forgive the splices and deterioration in this DVD. A very enjoyable early Fox musical. The only problem with this Image DVD is during the opening credits. As part of the Wade Williams Collection, they have superimposed a new copyright during the opening credits. This is an unforgiveable desecration of the film. New copyrights should only be shown before or after the actual film, so as not to mar them. I've never seen this done before on any of the Williams Collection features. This would have been a perfect release is not for the disrespect they showed this film."
5,A Kid's Review,I like the part where Prickly Porky and his friends scare away their predators. I would recomend this book for everybody
5,Commentary,This set was marketed for young people but is appropriate for the adult student of Torah. Different viewpoints of various scholars are presented.
2,Hannah More's 'Coelebs in Search of a Wife',"I would like to point out that this book is by HANNAH More, not Henry More as you have listed. Hannah More (1745-1833) was a school teacher, evangelical writer and political reactionary who was the author of large numbers of tracts and chapbook-style novels, such as 'Village Politics' (1792), designed to educate the poor in their duty of accepting a miserable lot in life and practising sobriety, diligence and religious piety. These works also warned of the dangers of political radicalism. 'Coelebs', More's only genuine novel, is directed more towards an aspiring middle class readership, and focuses on female conduct and education. More was also active in the campaign against slavery."
5,love potholders,I think potholders - which most of us use - can be fun and colorful in the kitchen. I had ordered several in different styles and they are all terrific and have held up well.
5,Creative Labs SBS Vivid 80 Speakers,My new speakers are small but have really good sound.Perfect for sitting next to my monitor.Thanks to amazon for offering such a fine product.
2,Disappointing Thin,Tin pan is an understatement. I purchased this item as part of a promo thinking I would try it. I would have been better to just pay shipping rather than get to $25 for supersaver shipping. The pan is so think that things are constantly burning. It was in the house less than a month before it became a bolt holder in the garage. This product is nothing like the other kaiser products I own.
1,Loaf pan,"this Kaiser Tinplate 12 in. loaf pan is not much, very thin, breads burn easily, can not be put in DW, price was great but nothing about is too enthusiatic!"
1,Do not buy this product,I am returning this product. It does not work. I try to insert a DVD and it will not accept it. I have tried many different DVDs and it keeps spitting them out.
1,Bad quality,Great features and well thought out. But the quality is horrible. Mine randomly ejected disks and screen started going bad after only 2 weeks. Afraid to buy anything Audiovox or EddieBauer after this. Luckily was returned for refund.
1,Great unit if it would work reliably,"First time out of the box it had problems. We had the unit plugged into another Audiovox display and after an hour into the first movie the remote display would switch into black and white. Only way to get the color back was to turn the DVD player off for a few minutes then back on but the problem would always return. If allowed to play for more than two hours the DVD player would stop operating when held upright with any DVD. Worked fine if laid horizontally. The unit also ran very, very hot which might explain the other problems."
1,"save your money, get something else","this is one lousy expensive player. as one of the reviewer mentioned, the hinge on the battery unit will break. i had the unit replaced by the manufacturer as part of the warranty. but, after a few weeks, it broke again, at exactly the same spot. AudioVox refused to have it replaced again because the 90 day warranty period is over. Also, it constantly freezes playing home made DVD movies, regardless of the format of the DVD disc, not to mention I can hardly read subtitle text. i wish they had a money back guarantee."
1,"Great, but don't expect it to last long","I've owned two of these now. The screen's great and I love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children. Our 2-year-old drove to New Mexico and back (well, we drove and he watched videos) with this thing.Unfortunately, both units broke after less than a year of use. The first one just stopped working (with a DVD permanently trapped inside). The second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that's happening once a minute now. So I am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one.All of these little players seem to have reliability problems, so my main advice to everybody is BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you WILL be cashing it in."
4,Good review,One will be able to peruse this work in an hour or so. Gives good working knowledge of Vietnamese ettiquette and mind-set. Great to have on hand as a reminder of what Vietnamese clients or students will expect from you. Generally accurate. Made me long for the days that I was fortunate enough to teach English to students from Viet Nam.
1,Lost in the text,"I ordered this book for my Kindle based on reviews. I am sorry I did. Without pre-existing knowledge of the country and it's political problems, I was lost. The first chapter tells about a daughter going back to visit her ailing father. That chapter was coherent and I could follow. The next chapter was a disaster because that's where I needed to have some pre-existing knowledge. I had to put the book aside. I don't know if I'll ever go back to it and probably have just wasted my money."
5,Too well written,"Set in the last days of the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic, the book describes the brutality of the dictatorship and the failed attempts to overthrow it. The description is as seen through the eyes and experiences of a few individuals. Maybe few books have been better written, but the description of torture is hard to read, far worse that that described in ""The Kite Runner"". Also important: the old aunt's denial near the end that her brother had commited any wrong. Ah, yes, the denial of wrongs committed, and the worse the crime, the more complete the state of denial."
4,Solid read,"With such an interesting subject it is easy to think that this book was practically written for the author. But something like the Trujillo dictatorship is not so easy to encapsulate in a single novel. This novel manages that, and brings you into the world of a violent dictator, as seen from his view, as well as those around him. Though there were parts that slowed down too much for me, that is a minor quibble. This book is great and you are brought into so many lives (and deaths) that it doesn't matter if you know how history ends--it's the good storytelling that matters. This book provides that in spades (a high four stars, if you will)."
5,A Masterpiece (Review of the Spanish Version),"The Feast of the Goat (La Fiesta del Chivo) is the best novel I've read since Alessandro Baricco's Seta. It is written with skillful technique and beautiful rhythm. The story line (three distinct but intimately intertwined threads) advances at a meticulate yet inexorable pace, speeding up gradually until it reaches a climax of human heroism, savagery and disgust. The ending, however, regains a sense of peace as the reader is let out safely from the grips of Vargas Llosa's prose. One of the many strong points of the book is that all attempts by the reader to dissect fiction from fact come up short. There is no need for such dissection, though. The suffering is real and so are the heroism, cowardice, love, revenge, political machinations, and the virile and vicious ""trujillismo"" that permeate the story. I will say no more; read the book and you will understand."
3,"Good writing, confused history","I read the book in Spanish and suspect it lost something (as most books do) in translation. I found it an easy if confusing read. Vargas Llosa is a good storyteller, and I greatly enjoyed Cuadernos de Don Rigoberto. But as much as I liked the storytelling, I was annoyed at the mixture of fact and fiction, which muddies history. One can't really tell what is what in this book, and beyond that, the habit of having a character (Urania, for example) describe conversations she didn't hear is annoying for the reader. The narrator can get away with that but not a character who wasn't there."
2,SOUND IS NOT DTS. ONLY 2 CHANNELS,THIS DVD'S SOUND IS ONLY 2 CHANNELS. THE SOUND IS GOOD BUT IT IS NOT DOLBY DIGITAL 5.1 OR DTS AS INFORMED IN PRODUCT DETAILS. IF I KNEW THE INFORMATION WAS WRONG I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS DVD. SHAME ON AMAZON. I WILL ASK MY MONEY BACK
5,Tuku music at its best,"If you've never listened to this artist, you're missing out! I suggest you listen with good headphones on because the instrumentation is every bit as engaging as his voice. Warning: Tuku music is upbeat and will raise your spirits."
5,CHOICES,"Hoop Dreams gives the world an opportunity to learn about Arthur Agee, William Gates and their families. More importantly, this book is an opportunity for the reader to improve the quality of their own life by taking an intorspective look at family values, choices, and career dreams."
2,Mysically overrated.,"MYSTIC RIVER is a well made, depressing, and genuinely run-of-the-mill drama that yet again shows the wide range of crying, weeping, and sobbing SEAN PENN is always capable of. Chock full of unsympathetic characters and predictable plot arcs, this flick is way overrated. Which should suffice for fans of PENN, who is the most overrated actor in hollywood today. He and the supporting cast do a decent job of bringing their characters to life, but the story doesn't give you a chance to really like any of them. CLINT EASTWOOD's direction is assured if not inspired and the end of the picture drags on for quite some time. Maybe I expected more from MYSTIC RIVER due to the high praise it recieved, but as a cinematic experience it's just plain there."
2,Acting=good Everything else=crap,"This movie was not great. The acting was great. I suppose the direction was good since I did not notice it, but there were so many problems with the story. I can't stand movies where characters make the ""obvious"" wrong choice, when the right choice is right there in front of them. I am so happy that I only rented this over hyped film."
2,Weak,"This isn't a good movie, the dialogue and acting are not first class, it is not gritty, is is not amazing. Everything that Clint Eastwood touches does not turn to gold. The acting is painful to watch. The characters are mostly so objectionable, you hate them all. This is a mediocre thriller devoid of excitement. The murder is explained at the end but there are many holes in the story. The reasons for the killing were quite weak. This movie is slow and dull. Too many talky scenes between the policemen. How many more movies do we have to see with disagreeing cops?The actors are pretending they are acting in a great movie. That sums it up for me. It's not a great movie. It's basically an extended TV show."
2,Don't know if I saw the same movie...,"Trully, I don't know what people saw on this movie... Besides the good actors - no surprise at this point, they really are great actors - it is only a promise... that never comes to the screen."
1,why oh why?,"Why should I purchase a 3 disc edition of a film for double the price of a normal movie, just to get unrequested commentary that I will never watch? Why didn't the producers give me the buying choise? Will this become some sort of new marketing gambit? It's bad enough that LOTRs played us for the extra footage without we should buy into this ploy. Thanks, but I'd rather not."
3,Just OK - not spectacular,"I was not all that impressed with this movie. The performances of the actors were great and Clint Eastwood did a superb job as the director. However, I was never able to envoke any real sympathy for Sean Penn's character. He just wasn't likeable. The movie's theme is dark and makes you think deeper than you would expect. It wasn't one I was excited about, wanted to buy on DVD or wanted to see again. I would have been OK with seeing it at our Tuesday night 50 cent movie theater, but not to pay $8 for. I just couldn't come up with any genuine feelings for any of the characters; they had too many flaws."
1,"Yuck, what a boring downer","This movie was a boring downer. Well done, but why do it. Why make something so depressing with no redeeming value? Dark, darker and shockingly amoral. Get something that will make you feel good, instead."
2,Seen Better,"Oscar nominations,wonderful cast,incredible director,compelling story...wasn't that great. One of my friends kept telling me that I'd love this film. That it was one of the greatest movies ever. I have to disagree. The cast of this film were quite convincing in their potrayals of characters,Sean Penn especially playing another darkly,intense character. My heart broke when I saw the scene of him finding out that his daughter was indeed killed,being held back by plenty of police officers in an attempt to get to her. Sean Penn's scenes were the only reason this film should even be watched. He deserved the Academy Award win for this film. Yes,you go on a weaving of story plots with an ending that may surprise you but there's really no substance in my mind. This is a film that I recommend you rent and watch only once...if even that."
3,Nothing special here.,"This is a well polished ""who dun it"" movie. The acting is decent, and the mood is consistent. The problem I have is the fact that this movie brings absolutly nothing to the table. There is nothing that is exciting and new when you watch this movie. It is just another murder mystery kind of experience. Also, it is very easy to predict the ending. There is nothing mind blowing about this movie. I would suggest this one as a rental because it does have a few aspects that make it enjoyable to watch. If you are looking for something truly great, you might skip this one."
2,What a disappointment!!!!,"My sister rented this movie and I'm glad she did. Saved me twenty dollars on this insipid farce of a drama! I cannot believe this was nominated for best picture, let alone all the critical hype. I thought this movie was going to be a great drama, or so I thought. Small town tragedy leads three broken friends to reunite after Sean Penn's daughter is murdered. It had its moments..and Sean Penn is a notable actor, but the ending left me cold and stunned. So much for morality. The look on Marcia Gay Harden's face as she searches helplessly for her husband and the unrepentant Laura Linney's gleeful smile is sickening....all and all this movie is okay for a rental...save yourself the twenty bucks..maybe the book is better,,they almost always are....disappointing Mr. Eastwoood...a waste of time"
4,great movie,Great cast. great movie. I don't want to give it away. I say rent it. I purchased for my girlfriend.She enjoyed it.
3,bad soundtrack,"This movie had excellent acting but I missed so much of the dialogue because I just couldn't hear what was being said much of the time. At home with it on my vcr, I turned the sound up to highest and still couldn't make out the actors' words. Most frustrating. Also, if one is looking to see an ""entertaining"" movie, stay home. There is nothing positive or hopeful about this film."
3,"Great acting, average story","This is movie was very average to me, and very overrated. The acting was great, but the problem is, these actors are acting in a film with a bad story. It's not a horrible movie, but it has it's flaws. For example, the ending was not satisfying at all (partly because of who the culprits turned out to be), and there was too many issues left unresolved.I can't give this film less than 3 stars because it wasn't BAD, but then again I can't give it 4 or 5 stars because it wasn't very GOOD. It was simply average."
1,IT WAS A LET DOWN!!!!! WASTE OF TIME!!!,"I thought this movie would be very good, because of the hype, but the story line stinks!!!!!I don't see what other people see when they say this movie is good.I don't recommend that you waste your time with this movie!"
1,Was There Any Redeeming Value in the Storyline?,"What a drag! A movie may be well-acted and worthy of many technical credits, but this plot was depressing, disturbing, and not even remotely entertaining.I realize that life is not all hearts and flowers. In fact, I can get into a heavy drama with the best of them, provided there is some element of hope, resolution, redemption or something that I can walk away feeling good about.There is nothing positive about this storyline and I cannot imagine anyone feeling uplifted by it.Sorry, Mr. Eastwood. I cannot recommend this film, although you have certainly given us other movies that were worth writing home about."
2,Superb acting,"To be honest, I had higher expectations. I haven't read the book and I cannot compare it to the screenplay. However, I thought that the film lacked in continuity, it would fall apart at times. Pacing was another thing that, in my opinion, suffered. Nothing remarkable with the cinematography either.Well, what came through though was undoubtedly the professionalism of the ""all-star"" cast (Bacon, Gay Harden, Linney). Penn delivered an incredible performance, yet sometimes he tended to overact. Robbins, who totally managed to capture his character, took my breath away with his powerful playing.Overall, I would recommend this film more to aspiring actors who could learn a-plenty from the aces of the profession."
2,Overrated,"Bad accents, a ridiculous pile-up of convenient coincidences, unconvincing speeches, are not redeemed by a strong performance from Sean Penn. This movie falls apart while you're watching it, and then really really really outlasts its welcome. Laura Linney's Lady Macbeth scene is laughable. Can you say overrated? Eastwood has directed far better movies. All I can imagine is that whatever made sense in this story was left out of the screenplay and might be found in the book."
1,Critics Have the Life,"This movie was a grand attempt (Big time director, actors, budget etc) to tell a story which was very well done in novel form. However, it falls on its face in too many areas. I hate to give too much away (although much is already missing) but there are two points that must be made. First, the killer is clear from the beginning and there is a very sensible reason for the killing - which turns out not to be the actual reason at all. The actual reason is MUCH less fulfilling. Second, we are supposed to believe that the cops are competent yet the climax of the investigation comes when both partners turn to the other and say ""I didn't listen to the 911 call, I thought you did""!! What!! And just to add to the insanity (This is a bonus complaint), Sean Penn's wife has a soliloquy at the end that comes out of no where. I understand that it is very difficult to take a good novel and make a good movie, but one thing to never forget is the PLOT!"
2,You Don't Gain Anything From Watching This Movie,"I have not read the book, so I cannot comment on that aspect. However, I didn't feel like I learned anything about humanity or the human condition from watching this movie. If you invest this much time in watching something, you hope to feel even just a little bit wiser when it's finished. The characters acted predictably and stayed ""true"" to their stereo-typical character types. No surprises. The 2 stars are for the relatively good acting and for the directing. Overall, though, watching it was a waste of time."
5,I've Never Felt Worse Coming Out of a Movie,"This is not happy ending kids, this is by far the most agonizing, frustrated, confused, and worst I've felt after viewing a film. That's why it's so brilliant. It makes no apologies, and doesn't cover up or sugar coat the reality of life. The performances are first-rate, top-notch hitters. Every actor involved gave the performace of their careers. Penn and Robbins earned their Oscars with the dept and truth they brought to their characters. Eastwood is a master at filmaking, and this is definitely a masterpiece. If you want a hard hitting, no prisoners drama, then this is absoultly your movie. I highly recommend this film and DVD."
2,bland and depressing,"Why do people like to see movies set in slums about scummy people doing crappy things? If I want to see that kind of stuff, I'll just drive downtown. The actors performed well, but seeing this just depressed me. And every time I see Sean Penn, I feel like I need a shower. If you want an uplifting movie, then don't see this."
4,A Close Look at Human Hardship,"Timothy Robbins and Sean Penn earn their Oscars in this one. Both play shady type people who are tarnished by the rough environment they grew up in...on the wrong side of the tracks in Boston. I found myself feeling very sorry for the characters and the deep holes they are digging for themselves in their lives. The films underlying message, I think, is that no human life is unimportant, no matter how messed up that life happens to be. Another message, sometimes things go terribly wrong and there is little anyone can do to change what fate has in store. A scary movie, but well dome by Clint Eastwood!!!"
3,clearer than the book,"Sean Penn's acting actually makes the petty crook come alive better than in the book.Three boys just messing around on the city streets in a poor suburbare targeted by predatory adults. One of them gets into the carwhich the policemen who aren't.Their lives are forever changed by that one moment.The boy who gets in and his two friends become grown upsin a strange way:one a cop, one a crook and the other justa struggling confused fellow who drinks way too much.The death of the 19 year old daughter of the crookbrings out old time troubles that had been mostly forgotten,like a murder and that time locked in the cellar.What results is a tragedy where againthe third guys gets in another car with two predators.Who the real killer is comes as a big surprise to everyone."
2,Certainly not Eastwood's best effort at directing,"Up to a point the film is beautifully directed and filmed. However, it is, in my opinion, marred by over-acting from Sean Penn and a very unsatisfying, implausible climax and resolution. That's at least two problems for this 'true to life whodunnit' that great performances from Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon can not overcome."
2,Great acting and everything else PLUS the terrible ending,"I would have to say that I heard lots of good things about this movie and thought well here is a movie that I will like and think is worth my time. Well, everything is great except for one thing, the injustice in the end. Just disgusting really. More action could have also fixed this movie. Almost any other ending would have made this a worthwhile movie."
3,Could have been better.,"This is a good movie the first time you see it, but after that there is no reason to watch it again. Sean penn's performance although deserving of a nomination could have been better, i think johnny depp should have got it. He shows emotion throughout, but in some scenes he lacks the right expressions to pull off the effect, the drama suffers becuase when he should be freaking out like in the scene when the cops are holding back(the best scene in the movie), he doesnt. Tim robbins is good but also could have done better. The story is average at best. The ending is the biggest dissapointment and is very predictable, they should change it really. The movie is an 8 out of a 10 the first time then goes down to a 3 the next."
4,Pretty Good ...,"This movie was pretty good :) and for once, fairly close to the book :); Would make a nice addition to your DVD library :)"
2,"Morally disappointing, could have been so much more","The basically unsatisfying tale of three friends separated by life changes, fate and time, though none of them have moved from the environs where they grew up.While Sean Penn gets the most sympathy I've felt since before he went to Baghdad (nicely undoing all the goodwill from ""I Am Sam""), his performance and Laura Linney's urban hausfrau-meets-Laby Macbeth can't save the moral failings of this film. Granted, any parent would feel ready to kill for Sean (except possibly soldiers' parents), but how far do you go?Other movies have explored this theme and I maintain that ""Sleepers"" addresses this sort of story better. The book is usually better anyhow."
2,So much potential but a huge disappointment,"This movie was full of tension and suspense right up to the last 10 minutes. Then the cliched, trite, stupid ending came and completely ruined it. Seriously, I enjoy dark movies like American Beauty but Mystic River is completely overrated. It's as if they tried out a bunch of different endings on some focus groups and picked the one that was the most tidy and that everyone could understand. Nice job Clint. I'm glad I only rented this garbage."
2,movie,This movie got so much hype. It wasn't good. Sean Penn's character was a total rip off of Robert Dinero!Don't believe the hype on this movie. It's a waste of time and the climax and plot twist of the two teen boys killing the girl is stupid and far fetched.
5,Better than I expected,"Most movies I watch and love in theatres are adventures and comedies. Having seen Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King, it became my favorite for Best Picture. After the Academy Awards I saw Mystic River and realized that the Academy Board must have had a tough decision between Mystic River And Return of the King. Clint Eastwood is a masterful director, and the cast is unmatched. Each character has a distinct set of emotions and reactions to everything that happens. The fact that the biggest question of the movie isn't answered until 5 minutes before it ends meant that the entire movie was always growing in intensity. Watch it for the academy award performances of Seann Penn and Tim Robbins, and stay for Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, and the rest of the cast. One of the years top movies, and easily worthy of being deemed a contemporary classic."
5,Amazing performances by the entire cast!,"I saw this movie shortly after reading the book. That is always tricky as one cannot help but compare the two. I was very impressed by the casting and performances, and the Oscar nominations and wins are very well deserved. The mood and setting were perfectly captured on film.Of course, not every detail can be put in a movie, and I wondered whether those who hadn't read the book would have questions, for example, about Sean's relationship with his wife and why he was in that situation.I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates an excellent drama with solid acting."
4,Mystic River,"At first I didn't want to see this movie but my husband insisted, I was glad I did, EXCELLENT movie & I highly recommend it."
5,soukey79@hotmail.com,I will make this short. INCREDIBLE! Very Intense! I recommend this movie to everyone.
1,"Simple, badly directed film.","Tim Robbins was the only redeeming quality of the movie. His acting was fantastic. It was quite clear who was the killer thirty minutes into the film. It seemed to me that Eastwood tried to throw curve balls from the beginning of the film to keep you off track, but it never worked. The first appearance of the killers in the film gave it away. Why were they there? What reason were they in the scene for other than to introduce them as the killers?Sean Penn overacted, Kevin Bacon seemed lost and Eastwood seemed to be out of his league. Very disappointing film."
1,boring and very disturbing,mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks .
4,so true to life,I have seen this movie several times and each time there is something new about the characters to learn and understand.I love movies that are character driven and this one is great
2,Disappointing,"I went into ""Mystic River"" fully expecting this film to live up to the critical acclaim and accolades that had been heaped upon it. With Clint Eastwood directing and Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney, and Marcia Gay Harden rounding out a stellar cast, I didn't think much could go wrong. Not true. This is one of the most disappointing cinematic experiences I've ever had. The plot is bland and is not in any way original or creative. In fact, it is derivative and closely resembles Lifetime movie of the week productions as far as story and execution go. It's your regular Whodunit movie, only with a Hollywood cast. I still have no idea what the big deal about this movie is. Yes, the acting is all right--it's hard for these actors to misstep--but in the end the story itself is simply not as engaging and original as critics made it out to be. I would avoid this one."
2,I Was Anxious To See This Film. What A Letdown!,"Based on all of the positive reviews and Oscar wins by Penn andRobbins, I was anxious to see this highly regarded film. What a letdown! From start to finish, it was over acted, overwrought and overlong! Never have so many actors toiled so mightily to let the audience and/or viewers know they could act. If you have a tendency towards depression... stay away from this movie.Special note must be paid to Sean Penn's embarassing facial grimaces throughout this motion picture!"
4,Great Film,One of the better dramas to come along in a while. Keeps you focused and guessing as to what has happened and who did it. Terrific individual performances by a number of well known actors and a few new faces
5,Wonderful,"A must see movie, if you are a Clint Eastwood fan. Awesome movie, Sean Penn is great as well in his role....."
5,Phenomenal- Eastwood at his best!,"This is one of the most incredible films I have seen in past years. Not only is the story intriguing, but the performances from Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are top notch. This movie contains non-stop suspense until the shocking conclusion. Dennis Lehane's remarkable novel is brought to the screen in all of it's glory. Eastwood is still on top!"
2,Just OK,"I didn't find Sean Penn's performance in this film anywhere near as interesting as Tim Robbins' and the ending of this movie was really unsatisfying. Not a bad murder mystery for most of it's duration, but as I said, I thought Sean Penn was a little overrated, and the end just ruined it for me."
5,Mystic Clint,I cannot believe why - WHY - so many reviewers gave 1 or 2 stars to this movie???!!!This is one of the Best movies from the last decade!In one film you have the magnificent directing and acting along with a stunning and surprisingly story with characters developing in the course of the movie...With subtlety...THIS is not achieved by many...Bravo Clint! You're the Best!
2,what a piece of ****,"totally over the top. zillions of great actors attracted to a highly flawed project by a big name who does a terrible job directing. don't believe me? watch it yourself. be my guest. but better not to.serendipidous trailer: ""if you are enjoying this, you will love 'fargo'"". In math we call such statements true by vacuous hypothesis, i.e. a false assumption impiies anything."
1,What a big let down!,"I can't believe Eastwood said this was his best film. This flick is to be avoided entirely unless you are a glutton for misery. The final revelation of the film -- in which Penn's character finds himself in a VERY bad, regretful, and awkward position -- redeams nothing, least of all the entertainment value of this dirge."
3,Over-hyped.,"Mystic River directed by Clint Eastwood is very unsettling and difficult film to watch. The beginning is tragic and the rest of the movie is a bit slow and one-dimensional. This is not Eastwood's best film, but the acting is superb thanks to Sean Penn. The performance that surprised me the most was Tim Robbins, he never stood out in his movies but this one he does and it's amazing. This film is a mixed bag, decide for yourself."
2,Good till the end,"Wow, this movie started great and had me thinkin who did it form the beginning. There was a great cast, and some great acting by Tim Robbins, but.....WTF was up with the last 10 minutes??? It was like clicking the channel button on the remote....Right when Sean Penn's character starts to develop, and to learn something from his pathetic life....they throw the last scene in with his women telling him he's king....sorry, but that scene and everything after it was completely lame, and should have been cut from the movie all together.It disturbed me so much that I have to give it a 2, since I will never ""by choice"" see this movie again. It's too bad because up until then it was a good movie."
3,"Good acting, good directing, horrible ending","About 20 minutes before this film ended, I was sure that I was going to put this film on my favorite films of all time list. Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes ruined what could have been an excellent film. Shakespeare had something called a catharsis. It is what's supposed to happen at the end. The last part that makes you feel satisfied. Now, I don't believe it would do wrong to reveal that Sean Penn's character, Jimmy, murders at the end. He commits an unjust murder. And he gets away with it too! And then you ask yourself,""How is this justice. How is the longing for justice fulfilled?"" Yes-indeed. How? How does this make you feel fulfilled when the credits come on? As for the rest of the movie, I have no complaints. The acting was superb, the drama was tense, the script was good, and Clint Eastwood did a superb job of directing. It was only the end that was bad. But, the end is the most important part of the story. Too bad indeed."
2,mystic river,"i have to say, with all the hype about this movie, it ended up being a big flop. the story was good for the first 75% of the movie, then the ending ruined it. its like they spent all their time and effort in getting the big named actors to star in the movie, then think that will make up for the lack of script. the ending is stupid and rediculous, kevin bacon, who is a cop, just walks away from the scene with sean penn, where he just told kevin that he killed tim robbins character, and sean just walks away like nothing happened and continues his life. what a HUGE dissapointment,any fans of kevin bacon, tim robbins, or sean penn should not view this film."
5,Wow!,"Yeah, it is one of the best of 2003. For me, it was Sean Penn all along, it came as no surprise when he won the Oscar for this particular role in which he was absoloutely BRILLIANT. The other actors build around him were flawlessly played by Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, And Laurence Fishburn. Nice work!"
1,DIDN'T GET THERE!,"I saw this a few months ago with my movie buddie, and we both felt that Sean Penn was just terrible, completly overacting, and Tim Robbins character was just too pathetic. the movie just kept missing what it was or what it should have been trying to accomplish. It absolutely stuns me that people liked it and gave it all those awards and missed out on the the wonderfullness of ""Lost in Translation"" and Bill Murray's oscar winning performance. I even forgot myself and thought he was sexy for a few brief moments. anyways i dont think ""mystic river"" DESERVED ANYTHING."
1,Terrible Show.....,"What is it with violent (pervertedly, randomly, and disgustingly violent) shows that have a modicum of emotional/relationship issues? Do they get a free pass of some kind? Do critics not know what to do with them? Not to be too simplistic but do people's minds turn to mush when presented with a film marketer's ""mystical holy grail"" of combining boy's likes with girl's likes. Violence with relatioship issues.This show was terrible. (And all apoligies to those who liked this show but they all probably like a History of Violence as well....an even more atrociously terrible show). And I am someone who doesn't mind violent shows if they are good.Bad, bad acting. Ridiculously dull dialogue. And a plot that made me want to vomit. And I didn't even bother to finish the show--but after reading the ending from other reviewers I now not only feel justified in my views, but emboldened enough to write this review."
2,Book is sooo much better..,"Please read the book first....otherwise you risk losing a great read because once you sit through this film you'll no longer wish to read it. I read the book, then saw the flick at the theater, maybe I was expecting too much considering how much I enjoyed the book but it was really, really bad. Please avoid.Girlfriend didn't like, parents either."
2,Much Ado about nothing,"I personally started liking Tim Robbins from Shawshank Redemption & Sean Penn from Dead Man Walking and I believe these were the movies these guys should have recieved oscar for their outstanding roles.Keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concernedAgain he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.The story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong. I actually fell asleep in between.Off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good. Sure TimRobbins plays a character of sexually abused child with lot of conviction but even that was potrayed better in Shawshank Redemption where he is abused by a few inmates.And the end is kind of loose.Give it a miss"
1,Are all the characters in this movie just plain stupid?,"The movie was ok until it got close to end. The accused murderer was murdered by his long time friend, the father of the daughter that was murdered. They all found out that the accused person was not the killer. And they all seemed like nothing happened. All the characters seemed kind of retarded near the end and that really made a good movie into a bad one."
2,"Overrated, much?","What a sad little disappointment this movie was.... or should say the longest disappointment of my life. The story moves along soooooo slooooooowly that I fell asleep 4 times before finally finishing it.Sean Penn tries too hard; and if it's possible, Tim Robbins tries even harder. I just didn't buy it. The whole thing was ridiculous, and it had the potential to be really great. I just don't see what all the fuss was about."
1,Mystic River..The Ending Bites,First off..someone please tell Clint Eastwood to back away from the camera slowly and never ever direct another film. As far as everyone who raves about this film..you have lost all cred. I supposed your enthralled by shiny objects too. The ending was ridiculous....my daughter is killed..lets go to a parade?????? The fact that this drivel was considered genius in two mediums is baffling...more proof that everything is watered down beyond hope...whoever says this is a classic- I have some old home movies..you wanna shell out money to see those too???
1,don't bother,"This is a movie that makes dumb people feel like they are experiencing ""art."" They are plenty of movies that matter; movies that, while horribly depressing, have something to say about the human condition. This is not one of them. This is a movie that portrays the kind of deep emotions and complex logic that can only be learned from other, similarly shallow, Hollywood swill. The lack of careful examination that went into this film just makes me angry."
3,streaming picture with little sound,"Picture was fine, one brief freeze but nothing that lasted long to be annoying - however, the sound was crap - not the quality but the volume - there just wasn't any decent volume - I will be very reluctant to use streaming movies from amazon again because of this"
1,Clint Eastwood should retire,I guess the judges felt that both Clint Eastwood and Sean Penn were overdue for an Oscar.
1,Trash from the Word Action,"This is simply the worst movie I have ever seen. And I am not alone. When I saw this the week it opened - to a full theatre - nearly everyone in the room laughed at Sean Penn's fake crying and TERRIBLE acting. This film is fumbly, immature, and just plain boring. I found it disinteresting and sloppy. The end is nothing short of stupid and confusing. Acting worse than a Star Wars film, and a thin - if at all present - storyline. Watch the cemetary scene where the entire camera crew is visible in the reflection of the headstones. Just plain amature backyard moviemaking. I fell asleep at one point and left the theatre wanting my money back. (I only gave it one star because Amazon requires at least one.)"
3,"hideous ""Boston"" accents mar potentially great film","Although the darkness of this film intrigued me, I was so distracted by the wildy uneven and generally poor Boston accents on display in this picture that I think I missed out. I would give it a higher mark if there had been no attempts to keep the dialogue sounding ""authentic."""
2,This movie is almost good,"Here's my story with mystic river. Began reading the book, but got bored and gave the movie a shot since it was a very interesting story. The movie pulled me in just like the book, and Sean Penn's acting was very good. I thought Tim Robbins was horrible and could barely stand watching him. When you get to the point in the movie where everything ties together it is, at least for me, a let down. And, overall, it made this just a mediocre movie for me. However, Stephen King said in an Entertainment Weekly column that it was one of the best movies he's seen in years. So, take his opinion or mine."
2,WAKE ME WHEN IT'S OVER!,"I always look forward to seeing Sean Penn, in a movie.This movie was boring, from beginning to end! I didn'tfind the story very interesting, or anything else aboutit. Sean Penn, over acted too, not like him to do so."
5,Mystic river,"Mystic River was the first movie that I have ever watched that was directed from Clint Eastwood, and I am happy to say that it was worth the time.Mystic River is very sad, and rather depressing. If you've ever watched the Sleepers, then you'll understand when I say that Mystic River was exactly like that one. Except this time Kevin Bacon was on the right side of the law.The ending did nothing in making the film lighter or more joyous, instead, it left me even more sad than when the movie began. Not the best way in ending a movie, but thats life I guess, not everything is going to turn out for the better. Still, I couldn't help but wonder if things could have turned out better, and what would have happened instead if such a thing was possible."
2,Mystic River--a metaphor for America and Iraq,A man with considerable power gets his buddies together to seek revenge on a man who must have had something to do with a heinous crime.A President with great power rallies his armies together to seek revenge on Sadam Hussein who must have helped Ben Laden blow up the Twin Towers.Get it?
1,Advertising Works,"Nothing says ""Message Movie"" like a big dialogue ending. Stink-o-rama.I had been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I missed it in theaters; now I wish I had missed it entirely."
3,A haunting film,This is a beautifully crafted movie. Eastwood direction is almost classical without relaying on any visual analogy or abstraction he creates an almost surreal atmosphere that haunts every single scene in the movie. The performances of the three major characters is for the ages and the level of deepness that they bring to the ordinary man is almost epic. At many points I felt there was more underneath than I was been shown as if there were paranormal forces forcing the characters actions but as I come to realize there isn't really much left its just our own perennial ghosts.
2,"Movie was good, the book was better",I had read the book so of course I was interested in seeing the movie. The movie had great actors and their work was done well but the book was just so much better.
5,Clint Eastwoods best to date as a Director.,"Great movie, Great acting ( especially Sean Penn ) Great screenplay, great direction, Great cinematography, Great cast. This truly is a fine movie worthy of multiple viewings. A movie that belongs in anyone's library who like the genre.Scott M"
4,Suspenseful thriller with superb cast,"Suspenseful, well-paced thriller performed by a top-notch cast and directed superbly. Tim Robbins gives a terrific performance as the relatively dull-witted Dave who gets caught in the crossfire of a wife who jumps to the wrong conclusions and bad circumstantial evidence. A classic...worth seeing again and again."
2,Major disappointment,"Viewer's of this film would be wise to not let the superficial twist at the end of the movie entice them or be awed. There is some major flaws that other reviewers have hit upon. I'll just say that it seemed pretty obvious to me that whoever wrote this story never created 'the mute' during early versions, and discovered that he (the author) had no ending and superficially imposed this undeveopled character to tie things up. It's really lame. Probably there was a time when Tim Robbins character was the evil party for the crime emphasized throughtout, but rather than milking this for meaty insights, he is turned into a flimsy character who comes away very inconsistent and...dead, still. I really wanted my money back after this one."
1,WASTE OF TIME,"This movie was good until I got to the lazy ending. Great actors who did a great job, but what were they thinking? Glad I rented it instead of paying $9 to see it. Let me ruin in for you: it's always the guy you least expect that's the killer. Shocking. THAT'S never been done before. SO original. GRADE:C+"
2,"""Your daughter's name is Nora!!!""","I came to this movie expecting to be deeply affected, but came away shaking my head in disbelief. The fact that Sean Penn (who gives a performance that is so over-the-top that it's actually somewhat amusing), and Tim Robbins (who has made a career out of being overrated) won Oscars for this piece of manipulative hackwork is downright surreal. Think a two-hour episode of ""Law & Order"". Or maybe ""Kojack""."
3,Amazingly Overrated,"I went to the local cinema with high expectations. I walked out wondering what all the fuss was about. Marcia Gay Harden(fancy Ma Kettle from COLD MOUNTAIN beating this brilliant thespian to her second Oscar????)& Tim Robbins do the best work of their careers here without a doubt. It was it's complete lack of originality that had me scratching my head in wonder. Add Laura Linney's bizarre Lady Macbethish speech & Sean Penn's unbelievably manipulative ""is that my daughter in there?"" scene & you have a movie so cheesy in it's ""Americanness""(is that a word?), it becomes akin to watching (yet another)Kevin Costner baseball flick. For the best(& bizarrely ignored)Sean Penn performance of the year, go straight to the emotional powerhouse...21 GRAMS."
3,"Mystic River--A Strange, Sad, Tragic Film","With a stellar cast, murder, betrayal, and suspense, Mystic River delivers. A blue-collar Bostonian community is ripped apart by a beautiful girl's murder; an unbalanced wife confides in the enemy, and the vengeful, tormented father, commits the unimaginable. Bring on more drama, tears, sweat, and rage in a father grieving and THAT would have left us at the edge of our seats. Aside from that, are we to believe that a man so sympathetic to his friend could actually murder his daughter? Where was the guilt that would have convinced us that David Boyle was capable of committing the crime? Too, the fact that an innocent man dies at the hands of a sick, twisted friend-is indeed a tragedy. I felt cold inside after watching this movie."
5,Damn Good Movie,"This movie was sooo touching. I felt everything as if I were there. Sean Penn was beyond excellent. I recommend this movie on a night at home where you just want to be reminded of how precious life can be. I don't have any fancy words or spectatular review to give except to say that the movie was good, the acting was excellent and the story line was real."
4,OH MAN!!!,"Man, it takes me such effort to sit down to watch a movie. When I sat to watch this, I found it sooooo enjoyable!! You do not want to even pause it, which I constantly do with movies. This movie is a good movie. Well done in the acting department. Very well done Eastwood!! You feel like you are watching a Soprano movie."
2,"Well acted, weak screenplay","Tim Robbins and Marcia Gay Harden both give excellent performances in this movie. Sean Penn was believable in some scenes, over the top in others. My main complaint about this movie was that the story became totally unbelievable toward the end, and there were many flaws in the logic of the plot. I was surprised at how unrealistic the story line was, after reading so much critical praise about it."
1,C Program Design for Engineers,"Book trys to be good at explaining programming, but it's not exactly something you can explain in a book."
2,Not the best,I am a c++ programmer and tried to brush up on C using this book. I had to buy a new book. Maybe an engineer can get some use for their $55 some bucks but I didn't.
2,Strange CD-ROM,"This is a CD-ROM of Buckethead featuring short video highlights fromhis concerts. When I say short, I mean short! I watched this wholething in about five minutes and left scratching my head. There are acouple of cool parts that show his lightspeed style of playing, but alot of it is stupid rapping or a turntablist messing around. It iscool to actually see Buckethead, but you don't get very much for themoney. In conclusion, this is definitely for completists only andisn't worth the money."
3,Still Waiting,"I bought this with a lot of anticipation, but it seems like Kelley has played it safe with what sounds like a collection of pop/blues/soul tunes that don't have a lot of connection to each other. From the credits it looks like she is moving toward the old school blues/soul production with this Nicholson guy that does Delbert. Having been a fan of Kelley's from way back, it breaks my heart to see folks like Susan Tedeschi getting all the fame and fortune while Kelley struggles to get the recognition she deserves. I'm guessing that until Kelley moves toward the more cutting edge song selection and production circles that Susan has access to, things will remain pretty much the same. I am keeping hope alive and waiting for Kelley to find the right producer and/or manager who can help her get over the hump and be the star she deserves to be."
5,Sometimes the Best Things in Life....,"are simple! This little book is the starting point in teaching Latin to your children. Beginning while they are young, learning the alphabet of any language you want them to be fluent in is of utmost importance. Most people skip this step all together, didn't do that with English did ya? ;)This book is very simple, with great pencil drawings to help you teach your child (or yourself!) the Latin alphabet and the sound of each as well. A great resource!"
5,amazing sounds & beats,Daft Punk's Homework is a great example of how technological advances can lead to amazingly listenable music. Advanced syncopation and new school rhythms meet an old school melodic infulence. It's a lot of fun to listen to.
2,Daft Album...Literally,"I was really disappinted with this album because I'd bought discovery before this one and it was a great funky cd.Now,my theory is that the 1st album of every artist ever, is always their best..Boy was I wrong...and a half!Homework absoloutly squashed that idea completely! After hearing the classic 'Around The World'(in my opinion their best song ever) i thought the album would reflect this. As soon as i heard the beginning track 'dafizetrse' or watever its called, i had an instinct that the album would suck..and it did. Don't bother with this album, the only 3 good songs (out of 16 tracks) are Around The World,Teachers and Oh Yeah. The rest are just noise. So, in a nutshell, this album stinks worse than a hobo, get discovery instead."
2,Wait... how many different beats are there in this CD?,"Okay, so I have to admit it. I own this CD. I do listen to it from time to time, but that is becoming rare. The beats were fun and maybe it was just the crazy video for ""Around The World"" that got me interested. But enough is enough. In ""Da Funk"", how many times can you hear that one riff before your head explodes or you just have to turn it off? Give me a break. They have some good reiffs going, now they just need to get the rest of the songs going."
1,A Labotomy Is Preferrable To Listening To This Junk,"The popular songs from this CD may have been club hits, but they don't transfer well to listening in the car or at home. Give me a 6 year old for five minutes and I could teach him musical ""skills"" that could easily surpass those of Bangalter and de Homen-Christo. The production is excellent, but it's like painting a pile of vomit red - it looks good, but it's still vomit underneath. The songs are dull, unoriginal, repetitive, and boring (and I'm being generous in my appraisal of this CD). This CD should include a ""vomit bag"" as a standard accessory - it's enough to make any human with an IQ 2 points higher than dead weeds hurl. The A/R corporate moron who signed this band should be fired.Bottom line blunt assesment: This CD sucks."
5,I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOD MY HEAD TO THE BEAT!!,"I first heard of Daft Punk during a MTV year end review. Obscure as the group was to me, I took a risk and purchased the album. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The diverse beats are interwoven in an intelligent, yet ""playful"" manner. A good audio system will allow a more thorough appreciation of how intricate the music really is. This album has been on heavy rotation in my CD player for quite a while. Fighting the urge to dance with this one is impossible. SUPERB. A MUST FOR BEAT NUTS!!!"
4,A Dance Machine-From Start to Finish,"Daft Punk grinds you, grooves you, and rocks you with an electronic-heavy album. Best cuts are ""Around the World"" and ""Da Funk"". If this don't get you moving, I don't know what will."
5,rejuvination,"This piece of exceptionall work has manifested itself towards the ""New Modern"" age of digital rock music. Everything from amazing breaks to smooth transitions are not only ones that impressed me; it is the astonishment of experiencing the vitality and energy in which it creats to alter your state of mind, one that does in a subtle manuver which makes Daft Punk a rejuvination of the classical music era. Everthing from its composition to its development, Daft punk not only seeks similicity in the literal sense, but it also brings the primitive drive out of us: an abstract concept. I give this piece of magnificient creation of art four thombs up!(including big my toes :)"
5,this is the best electronica cd ever made! a must havee,this cd is so popular i've had it stolen from me twice and everyone has trouble finding it im glad they have it here.this cd has some of the best beats ever.
4,It's worth it for track 4 and 7.,"Daft Punk is awesome, but it's pretty damn wierd. Most of the tracks aren't as good as Crystal Method, (I highly recommend Vegas, by Crystal Method.) but two songs, ""Da' Funk"" and ""Around the World"" are even better. It's worth buying the CD for those two, not that the rest of it is bad at all."
1,WAY too repetetive!,"Personally, I like Da funk, but the version I hard before I bought this disc must have been a diferent one. This is one of Daft Punk's low points. The beats are way to repetetive, going unchanged and without a tune for 16, 24 or more measures. I bought it and i don't thing it was worth it. If yoyu ask me, I'd say get a good import."
1,"I'd rather be doing my ""Homework!!"" than listen to this!!","With the exception of ""Da Funk"" ""Revolution 909"" and ""Around the World,""(which are the main tracks), the rest is just filler. Three good tracks and 13 that arn't, doesn't constitute much of an album. Most of the tracks, like ""Rollin' and Scratchin'"" repeat the same beat for almost a full minute, before merely fading in another looped sound, or drumbeat. Other tracks, like ""Burnin"" feature the worst Dj scratching I've heard,using the same scratch over and over and over.........and over. (If this type of ""quality"" music suits you, check out Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music"" or Marilyn Manson's ""Smells Like Children"")"
1,worst cd i own,"i was in my late teens when i bought this cd after hearing the songs like the chart topping ""around the world"" and the awesome ""da funk"". However the rest of this cd is a major dissappointment and this album is no way 5-star material. Other ok highlights are ""teachers"", ""oh yeah"",""fresh"", ""revolution 909"" are some of the other so-so tracks that are listenable. The rest well is annoyingly unbrearable(rock & roll)and unlistenable filler that will ultimatly lead to a terrible headache if you listen to it for too long. download the good songs or get the singles but don't buy it coz its not worth the money, buy discovery instead."
1,ugh...,"Okay, this album exemplifies exactly what I hate about dance techno: ""songs"" featuring one (1) beat repeating many, many times, very, very loudly. The sort of thing that tends to give one headaches, as well as filling one for the desire for a railgun with which one could waste one's unpleasant roommate who constantly bloody plays it."
1,Total Waste,"Written by a non-ringer, who is not stuffing the ballot box... Except for track 7, this album is a total waste of resources. And track 7 is only mediocre. This falls into the worst of the worst albums ever. The only reason I am rating it 1 star is because I can't give it anything lower."
2,Messed-Up Vinyl Pressing,"I got this album twice, and both times the songs on both sides of the record skip and hop. It's too bad, because it sounds great in between skips. Someone else mentioned that their vinyl pressing was messed up as well. I'll have to return this one and hope they release one that works in the near future."
4,excellent,"As a music fan and review, it is always healthy to bring yourself totally out of your element. I love rock prog blues and jazz. House is a genre I know next to nothing about.When I go to get my hair cut and stroll in to hear BOOM BOOM BOOM, I am not to crazy about the feeling. It feels to me music very young people dance, drink and have sex to. But when I heard this Daft Punk album was top of the line dance music, I got it.And like it. The beats are there, at ranges a non-dance music fan is not used to. But hearing the synthesizer flourishes and the funky hooks here absolutely make this music to me. I am awed by the little needles of sound and rhythm shifts that pulsate through Daft Punk's music, which makes it to me an amazing musical experience.Probably this will not be a mainstay for me, but when I need a diversion, I know where to go."
1,"Bought it twice, both were defective! Don't buy this item!","Bought it twice, both were defective! Don't buy this item! Both skipped on front and back in exactly the same place on one of the discs. Looks like this was a bad pressing."
3,Homework: A New Fans Review,"So I got into Daft Punks discocery album last year a lot... well I got really into the songs on the album but I had no clue who Daft Punk was or that they had albums out. So I set out to buy their stuf and ended up buying all their albums and some singles like Around the world, Revolution 909 and Alive 1997.I loved all the albums I got, except this one. I mean I love Around the world and Da Funk, but the others are really not that great... I mean I guess they are good beats and stuff, but as songs I feel they fall short. Although I still give this album much credit for it is their first. And they are good beats...-Bassically if your looking to buy this album because you liked Discovery or Human AFter All, you might be dissapointed"
5,techno reaches a new level,"Daft Punks premier album has proven that they have what it takes to reach the top in electronica music. With their perfectly timed beats and creativity, they make ""Homework"" an album worth buying."
3,Wow...,"I don't know what it is about this cd; the music is awesome, it's an incredible new sound, but I just can't listen to it. I get so uncomfortable when I listen to songs like ""Rock 'N Roll"" and ""Fresh"", and I don't know why. Maybe I'm just a very casual listener, and this music isn't my type, yet I really like it. If you're a hardcore techno fan this is the cd for you. Frankly, I like any genre of music, but Daft Punk's Homework is one cd that makes me squirm and itch in my seat for times to come."
4,Just the begining...,"""Homework"" sounds like a test, an experience Daft Punk have attempted for in order to improve their work. Except for ""Around the world"", it's imature music. Very different of ""Discovery"", THE BEST CD OF EVER!!!!!!!Anyway,Homework's worth 5 stars...."
2,Disappointing,"I really don't know what the attraction is to Homework. No ""5 star"" album should have tracks that you automatically skip, like 'teachers', 'rollin and scratchin' and 'oh yeah'. The album does have its moments: 'around the world' and 'phoenix' are great songs, but on the whole I find Homework one of the most overrated albums in the electronica genre."
1,Garbage,"You listen to this album and Discovery back to back and this album becomes firewood. Much more catchy tracks on Discovery. Discovery just took this album and shot it multiple times. I'd rather pour gasoline on my record player and watch it set on fire than listen to some tracks on this album. All the good tracks on this album are killed by the dumb ones! Just go here: http://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Daft-Punk/dp/B000059MEKThank you and DO NOT buy this album. As much as I love Daft Punk, all this is good is for a scratcher at the club or something else when you ran out of records and the people in the club are forming an angry mob around you. Thank you."
3,Where it all began,Who knows what the state of techno/electro/house fuse music would be in if it weren't for Daft Punks release of Homework. It certainly wouldn't be where it is now. If you wish to hear where much of it began this is your album. As far as other Daft Punk albums go I would rank this 3rd in listenability however it still has a song or two guaranteed to bring back memories.
4,a master piece,"I gotta say that I was very surprised when I read the reviews already existing because I didn't find them very helpful at all.To me, homework is certainly one of the best house music cds ever, and by far. For people that like hard house, rollin'& scratchin' is for you, it is just perfect! I don't know how people can like this cd but don't like this track, it s just awesome. It is a very eclectic cd, which takes you from the crowded beginning of the night with ""around the world"", and brings you to other places with ""Rollin' & Scratchin'"" passing by ""Burnin'"". All those tracks will make you dance all by yourself in your room, and will make you have the time of your life! Don't miss it, definitely a master piece.."
5,"Daft Punk, when they knew better","After Listening to Discovery, i felt the need to write a bit about how GOOD Homework is. Discovery was a pretty lame follow up to this, some people called it progression, well I always say ""if its not broke, dont fix it"" This Album was a classic, every song is well thought out, and most importantly, danceable. From ""Daftndirekt"" to ""Alive"" its non stop funky disco, mixed cleverly with techno. All in all a great piece of work. its by far my favourite dance album."
4,Very Nice and Funky!!!!!,"This is a fun record... anyone buying this record looking for salvation will probably be disappointed, but if you want a fun, funky, dance record, then this is it... I love it personally, and it always hypes me up when I listen to it... just listen to the wicked... beats on Revolution 909, the soothing waves on Fresh, the funky bass of Around the World, the discoy feel of High Fidelity... it's great fun, and if you like dance music, you need this in your collection... if you like music you need it, for some variety... it's great fun, pick it up..."
5,This book rocks!,"If you're thinking about freelancing, this book is fantastic. If you've been freelancing for a while, this book is fantastic, too. I've been a freelancer for almost two years now, and reading other people's queries in this book has really helped me sharpen my own query writing skills. The Q&A section at the beginning of the book is really helpful, too."
4,Practical help,"The Renegade Writer's Query Letters that Rock gave me real motivation at a time when I needed some. The authors write in a light, informative style, always with the implication that You Can Do It. Which helps.The advice is practical, which is the best thing about this book. You can actually apply it straight away, to make your writing more fruitful.Would recommend this to anyone who is serious about the business of writing. Helps to know that both authors are just naturally good at writing and selling, without degree upon degree."
2,Query Letters that Rock,"Too general--not enough specific informnation on ""how to write a query"" The book How to Write Attention Grabbing Query & Cover Letters was much more effective."
1,No subtitles,"Fine performance, but be prepared to watch it in the original. The subtitles don't come on, no matter what you do. Manufacturer needs to recall and replace."
5,Excellent,are long and elastic exactly what I wanted which was to protect my knees fast shipping and smooth and I recommend them for a bargain pressures
3,Hyperbole,"i like Blue Lines, but the truth is it is a derivative piece of music compared to Mezzanine. I know there are those who think Mezzanine is several steps down, and Blue Lines represents MA's apogee, but when I heard ""Be Thankful..."" for example, I thought ""straight out of Style Council, right down to the precise guitar textures and harmonies."" What is ""one Love"" but souped up reggae? I don't mind pastiches of others' sounds, from PM Dawn mumbling ""comatose"" to ""west end town in a dead end world..."" whoever the hell that was, but call a spade a spade. Blue Lines is fine, but it ain't a big breakthrough that's gonna last a millenium. Neither will Mezzanine, but Mezz takes more risks, and for me, provides far bigger rewards"
4,The Beginning of something GREAT,"Massive Attack's first CD ""Blue Lines"" shows the promise of great things to follow, and follow it does with their subsequent releases ""Protection"", ""Mezzanine"" and the new ""100th Window"". This album, while not quite as haunting, dark and brooding as their subsequent releases, shows the start of a winning groove. That they inspired several great acts to follow in their footsteps is an accomplishment. If you think that this album was recorded and released 12 years ago, you can see how ahead of it's time it was. This CD should definitely be part of your Massive Attack discography."
3,This and that....and the use of Wally Badarou's music.,"CHeck out the cut Dreamin'..That whole sound is from Wally Badarou's album, Echoes. Echoes is a wonderful album...all instrumental, mostly synth. Badarou was the best at what he did, and his music on Echoes was very attractive, and had real melodic ideas. A classic. Look up Wally and say hello...and buy Echoes. Wally used the Prophet 5 a lot in his sound...and it's super rich."
5,This album is now old enough to vote.,"That in and of itself blows my mind. I don't need to go in depth about the style and impact of this music, but I will say that I am still waiting for someone to top it... but I'm not holding my breath. If you are too young to have heard this one the first time around, pick it up. Cuts like Unfinished Sympathy, Daydreaming, and Safe From Harm helped to create and define trip-hop. The album takes some unexpected turns, unlike later Massive albums that tend to maintain one sound throughout an album. That's not a bad thing. When I first got the album, I wanted it for the grooves for dance class and the gym, so I skipped a a few tracks that didn't fit that vibe for me. I don't skip them anymore. It's that kind of album. Put it on a good pair of headphones, lean back, and enjoy."
4,"pretty good CD, except for one song...","I could listen to ""Unfinished Sympathy"" and ""Hymn of the Big Wheel"" for hours before I switched tracks. They are gooood songs. The only real qualm I have about this CD is one other song. Just one song... ""Blue Lines"". I don't know why I don't like it. I just don't. Why did they entitle their CD ""Blue Lines""? I thought, since they named this CD, which graced the world with ""Unfinished Sympathy"", with that song, it would be a gooood song. Maybe the reason why I dislike Blue Lines so much is mainly due to disappointment."
5,AFTER MORE THAN 7 YEARS STILL MY FAVORITE AMONG MY 350 CD'S,"Blue Lines is my favorite cd all times after all these years. 'safe from harm' and 'unfinished sympathy' gives me goose pimples, the angel voice from Shara Nelson with a deep warm bass mixed with a perfect beat is really awesome. This cd is a must in your collection !"
2,I don't get it.,"I don't get why this CD is such a big deal other than it was the first CD that Massive attack released. I consider myself a massive attack fan, but it just sounds very outdated to me. Don't get me wrong. There are a few songs that point to group becoming excellent in the future. Five man Army is great. So is blue lines, and Safe from harm is alright for sounding like early 90's dance, but other than that I didn't care for it."
3,Pretty Cool,I guess if you have to choose some modern music that doesn't completely ... then Massive Attack is a good choice. Some very cool sounds(aside from the hip hop influence). The more soulful songs are the real gems here. Pretty soon someone is going to be brave enough to make music similar to this without the scratching and rapping and we'll finally have a truly new alternative music form. Until that time Massive Attack does a nice job mixing styles without sounding too run of the mill.
3,Reviews here crack me up.,"One called ""One Love"" the worst song on the album, Horace Andy has more vocal talent in his little finger than any other male vocalist this band ever employed. Since this is all about personal opinion here is mine : Tricky is WACK, Del Naja's vocals are about the worst EVER. ""Safe From Harm"" is the bomb, check out the original ""Stratus"" by Billy Cobham.The coup de grace of reviews here is the one numb-skull who claimed that trip-hop came before hip-hop and that ""American negros"" borrowed form this. Some British people crack me up. They suck up all our culture and don't bother to actually learn about it.Go ahead and slam this opinion, but you know Tricky is over-rated and Del Naja has a pathetic singing voice."
2,Mostly bland.,"Blue Lines is not as good as Mezzanine. It's that simple. Mezzanine is a superb album full of scary tunes with good rhythm, whereas Blue Lines is a somewhat disjointed album full of mostly rap songs. The only songs I like are Safe From Harm and Unfinished Sympathy. These two alone can't carry the whole album over the line seperating average from good."
3,But I wouldn't call it a massive attack,"""Massive Attack"" I'm sure was supposed to convey intensity, but honestly I see no evidence to back up this claim. I mean, that DOT placard doesn't even meet OSHA or NFPA standards - it's supposed to be white lettering on the red background! This is a disaster, people. Not to mention that it's clearly only a level 2 hazard which is maintained easily enough. Massive Attack? More like Mediocre Attack. Only three stars for lack of research."
2,"If you want the best of Massive Attack, get Mezzanine","Having picked up Massive Attack's Mezzanine on a whim this past summer and fallen in love with it, I thought I'd try the others and got Blue Lines. Don't get me wrong, it's a good album (Unfinished Sympathy is amazing), but it's just a pale shadow of Mezzanine. It must have been amazing when it was first released but it just doesn't hold up when you know where MA has gone since. The music for Mezzanine is so much more complex and scary (it really affects you when you listen to it late at night or while you're writing a story) than Blue Lines' and 3D's voice on this earlier album doesn't even compare to his menacing rapping on Mezzanine. Blue Lines is a great debut but listen to Mezzanine to truly hear a band that is top five best in the world."
2,"Sad,sad,sad","After listening to "" Protection"" i believed all the hype about this one.Apart from the first song and a couple more,I find this album generally boring"
5,Massive in the area...,"Certainly this album comes from a different time than all you dark-headed Mezzanine-ites out there are used to. Consider it on its own merits, though. It truly is one of the most brilliant contemporary albums I've ever heard. Unfinished Sympathy was voted one of the favorite songs EVER by Radio 1's listeners for a good reason. Buy it. Now."
4,Much more soulful than their other efforts...,"...though their other albums are each great in their own right. Actually, I heard ""Protection"" and ""Mezzanine"" before I picked up ""Blue Lines"", and I was amazed by the soulfulness of the latter. This album owes a lot to soul, R and B, and hip-hop, and it makes me wonder how the moniker ""trip-hop"" was born. Horace Andy is great on this album, much better than he is on ""Mezzanine"", and Tricky's good, too. The title track is my favorite, I love driving around the city and listening to it. Definitely get it!"
4,Groundbreaking work,"This cd revolutionized the sound that would eventually come to be known as 'trip-hop' or 'downtempo'. A wonderful mix of styles and influences. ""Unfinished Sympathy"" is the immediate favorite, but many others grow on you and soon you are playing the disc non-stop. Recommended"
5,They need six stars for this!,"Anybody reading millenial lists of albums/music/etc of the past 1000 years will have noticed this title sneaking into the top ten in several places. Considering that it was up against, to name but a few, Beethoven, the Beatles, Mozart and Mr Presley himself, this is a notable achievement.The album itself is nearly perfect, the only off bit being the final track, in my opinion. Blue Lines still sounds as fresh and contemporary today as it did when released in 1991. As the intervening years have seen the birth and death of acid jazz, trance, girl power, boy bands, the final whimper from Acid House, and currently the mainstream popularity and almost inevitable fall of Nu-metal, this timeless quality would seem to be the satisfaction of one of the first criteria of true greatness.Go out and buy this; I genuinely believe that this album will still be being talked about in twenty, fifty and probably a hundred years, and will still be as popular then as it is now."
4,The birth of a sound...,"Massive's characteristic low haunting bass lines overlayed with heartfelt yet sleepy lyrics gave birth to an entire genre. This album is undoubtedly the influence behind many similar bands that would come later and fall under the genre of ""trip hop"". ie/portishead, morcheeba, tricky (obviously!), sneaker pimps, etc.This album is the womb of trip hop and is a joy to listen to, minus one or two dull moments. If you like any of the bands listed above you should probably consider buying this CD."
3,i was not impressed,"While this album is the most highly lauded of the long and amazing career of Massive Attack, it left me disappointed, prehaps because of all the hype I had heard about it before listening. Sure, safe From harm and Five Man Army are nice tracks but don't expect them to just knock you flat like 'Angel' or 'Black Milk' from Mezzanine did for me.The production, owing to its age of course, definitely has that 'eighties' edge to it which I dislike; and there are a couple songs which I just can't STAND! 'Be Thankful for What You've Got' has to be the most annoyingly whiny song Massive Attack have ever made!! And there are too many that just failed to impress or were overshadowed by later, more refined productions on Mezzanine.Bottom line: if you're a fan of Massive Attack because of Mezzanine, like i was, you might be hugely disappointed. In any case, don't buy the hype; after 4-5 listens I still can't see what everyone's raving about. Good, yeah, but not great."
2,Just a step above spam,This product is best left in your desk drawer at work for when you simply don't have time to run out for lunch or you forgot to pack a sandwich.
4,First One Went Bad - Amazon Came Through!,"We decided on the Toshiba 52"" HL167 after many long months of techology research, price comparisons, and the overall ratings we had seen. Received our HDTV and it worked spectacularly - for 2 weeks. Two areas of dead pixels appeared on the panel and, totally stunned, I immediately notified Amazon. They promptly exchanged the Toshiba for another one and had it delivered within less than a week (5 stars to Amazon!). The dead pixel lines increased dramatically over the next few days to about 36 inches across the panel. I was quite surprised at this failure as I had not seen anyone experience any pixel problems with this Toshiba model.We've had the replacement for about a month now, and so far, so good - but you can't help but feel a little cautious. The picture truly is stunning with HD broadcasts (we have DishHD), only wish there were more. Overall, Amazon's response to our situation was incredible, but keeping my fingers crossed with Toshiba."
5,Just what I been looking For,"After looking at a consumer magazine, and checking on prices in stores and online, this tv beat them all. A 52' lcd 1080p HD with a great picture. You just cant beat the price and quality.So if your looking for a 46"" or bigger,I would recommend this tv over them all."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,I have a similar Toshiba 47LZ196 that I paid $3499.99 for in Dec. 2006 that is just under 1 year and 2.5 months old and the panel ($3400.00) crapped out on me. After being informed by multiple Toshiba reps that I was in the window to receive assistance I was informed NOTHING would be covered and I was responsible for the cost of the part and repairs. What a joke for a higher end flat panel. One year and almost $4000.00 down the old crapper. Such a shame since I really liked that tv.
2,Screen defect appeared two months later,"I purched this tv two months ago. Nobody scratched it. I only have one good daughter who's always very gentle and never went near the tv. But some marks appeared since last week that looked like an airplane right in the middle of the screen. Everytime when it is a light colored a picture, you can see it -- looks just like an airplane coming over from a distance. I actually don't think it is a scratch mark. I think the screen somehow did it by itself. I want to return it. But it's already more than two months. Hopefully Amazon would still let me return it, even if that means I need to pay a fee.There are two other things I don't like about this tv.1. The black frame. It makes the pictures appear to be darker. The silver frame tvs look much better. Wish I noticed that difference before my purchase. But Toshiba got such a good rating. I guess I was over influenced by that.2. The picture quality - not exactly what I expected."
5,Love it!,"Just got this TV - picked it because of its top rated reviews on its video processor and also the anti reflection of the screen. If you have some backlight this one is the best. SONY XBR is a little more reflective and Samsung is the most reflective. If you have no side or backlighting go with the Samsung because it will be the clearest and sharpest, however you will have to live with the reflection of the screen. This one does not reflect at all!!Enjoying!"
5,Wow! We made a great decision!,"We ordered this LCD the weekend before Christmas. It shipped Christmas eve and Eagle delivered the TV the following Wednesday. They brought the TV in, unpacked it and allowed my husband to check it over. Because it was only 12 degrees outside, they recommended not plugging it in until it warmed up. We had it up and running that evening with a fabulous picture.We hooked it up with our Philips home theatre system and it is unbelieveably clear --even on NFL and NHL sports! We have no motion lag. Like several others, we had compared to the samsung 120Hz in stores and couldn't see a difference so we were able to get the 52"" Toshiba for the price of the 47"" Samsung 120Hz. Wow --Amazon has some great pricing and the delivery service is definitely top notch. You will not be dissatisfied with this purchase! ENJOY"
4,Great for the money,"I was a little nervous about ordering a TV over the net but Amazon made this a wonderful experience. The TV was delivered right to our door and unpacked, up and runnig in less than 5 days from time of order.This HDTV has an excellent picture for the price, my husband did quote that it could have a better manual that would be easier to understand in hooking up and running other equipment.We would recommend this TV and Amazon's service to everyone.Thank you,Webbers Falls, Ok."
5,Great T.V.,So far I'm impressed with this television. The pictures are clear. No ghosting or any other malfunctions noted.
5,Nice T.V. for the price,"I got this T.V. for exactly $1999.00 OTD and so far I am very happy with the it. It took a little fine tuning for the picture and sound so you might have to do that right out of the box, but after that... the picture is amazing when watching HD and/or Blue ray. The sound is also surprisingly good. I love the black finish, sets a theatre tone in my opnion when watching movies. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase."
2,choose another knife set,"I bought these knives thinking that they would be a decent quality kitchen knife. I've had them less than 3 months and they are already have rust spots and are somewhat dull. I've hand washed and dried them, so it's not a ""dishwasher"" problem. Knife weight and size is good and they look nice, but not high quality for the price."
3,Harmonia,I would love to listen to samples of James Hardman. I will not buy unless it is the James Hardman I've heard before. Can you help me please. Deanna Araya
3,Two of the best VITALOGY songs. So just buy the album.,"These are two of the best cuts from Vitalogy. Since STBC was the first single from the album, long before it was released, it was nice to get a listen to something else from Pearl Jam's much anticipated third record, but since you can get the album this CD really isn't anything special. Just buy Vitalogy and let it all sink in."
2,not enough here,Why do Pearl Jam only give 2 songs that is so scabby. Pixies used to always give 3 unreleased with the single (all bands should do this). Oh yeah the songs are cool just buy the album.
2,I agree with most of the others,"There is little point in buying this CD. It has the album versions (i.e. not live or rerecorded) of two songs: ""Spin the Black Circle"" and ""Tremor Christ,"" both of which are great songs, but, like other reviewers stated, they're already found on VITALOGY. That's the reason I give it 2 stars. The same goes for the ""Who You Are"" single, which also has no non-album tracks."
3,Beautiful set w/nice block,"I purchased this set on clearance at Target for $59.99...Needless to say I love the look. They are very, VERY sharp. I was washing them and halfway cut my finger off, very clean cut though..lol Owned them for over 2 yrs and I still dont have a problem with them other than the rust. I still havent had to sharpen them. I mean I dont have the time or energy to be washing every single thing my family and I eat off of, so off they go into the dishwasher. And what do you know if you're not promptly taking them out you've got rust. I find myself using a brillo pad to try to get it off sometimes it works sometimes not. Hand wash Only!Pros:PriceLooks greatSharpCons:Block is cheaply made & scratches easilyRust... Oh yeah and RUST!Don't forget the rust"
1,They rust and the shears are chinsy and dull,"We received these as a wedding gift a year and a half ago. More or less, they've served us reasonably, but I doubt they'd still be useful if I hadn't obsessively sharpened them. Out of the box they were incredibly dull. The accounts of rust are extremely well founded. Do not put these in the dishwasher if you must have them. Honestly though, if you're going to buy knives around this pricepoint, do what we're planning on doing: buying Chicago Cutlery to replace them. Just don't get these knives. The $15-20 you'll save buying them won't make up for the amount of time you'll spend with them and then replacing them. Ish!"
2,rust warning,I've had these knives for well over a year and can vouch that they do indeed rust and are not worth the money
4,"Effective, but hard to see fleas","I bought this because it looked good, however I neglected the fact that fleas are dark colored. Therefore, it was harder to pick them out of the comb compared to a silver-toothed comb. I personally have pretty good eyesight, but to those who have a hard time seeing to begin with, I certainly would not recommend this comb. It works very well to get the fleas off though, and if you were looking for a comb to groom your cat(s) with this would work wonderfully. Overall, it's a well-built comb, but be advised that it's not the most user-friendly when it comes to flea removal."
3,"Scratches easily, other than that, OK","This ring is fine - the size fit me perfectly. It's very light weight (which I like), and it fits well (size 11 really is size 11). However, it scratches much more easily than I was expecting, given it is titanium. I really like the color, just a little darker than white gold. For the money, an ok deal..."
5,Excellent!,"Patrick, you state in your book that you plan on running for president of the USA. If you can take several more steps without becoming corrupt, I'll vote for you. This book was written by a highly motivated young man. He used examples from his own life, but mostly outlined what it will take for each of us to reach our own goals, and dreams. I also found it interesting that he lives on Bainbridge Island. I've been there and it is awesome. One can't help but get a boost of enthusiasm from reading a book like this one. Well worth every penny and minute spent!"
3,stick with instrumentials-please no vocals.,"track 1- 1,300,000 and track 11- 250,000, i just do not get the point. the vocal tracks are a total waste of time. they should have put out an all-instrumential release. light years ahead of any of the other tracks."
4,Universal Shredder Lubricant Sheets,I ordered these by mistake but am glad I have them on hand to lubricate the blades of my shredder.
1,Not what I thought it was.,I some how thought this was a paper shredder and I was very sad on christmas eve when i realized it was not. I couldn't even return it cause it would have cost my half of what i paid for it.. :(
4,decent shredder at a decent price,"Thia shredder is well made and considering the prices and quality of others in the marketplace, is a good choice for the home or very small office."
4,they do a good job despite their smaller than advertised size,"Universal makes some mighty good shredder lubricant sheets that, although they are indeed half the size as others noted, still really do the job well. Just one sheet into your shredder every three or four weeks and your shredder will last you a lot longer! In my experience I can hear the shredder working with less effort immediately after inserting one of these sheets into the shredder.They are half the size of what they're supposed to be, so I obviously can't give this a five star rating. If you're concerned about the smaller than advertised size, use two sheets for good measure. It won't harm the shredder and it'll work much better. I agree with reviewers who write that it's remarkable that there's no oil or any other liquid spilling or leaking from these shredder lubricant sheets.A good investment to make your shredder last a long time!"
1,really people?,I guess people here don't realize that you can just drizzle a tiny amount of vegetable oil (DO NOT USE PETROLEUM OR AEROSOL BASED OILS) spread evenly on an normal sheet of paper and it does the exact same thing. That is actually a recommended method of lubrication for several shredders I've owned and it says so in the manual. And it won't cost you anything. And it works just fine.This product makes about as much sense as a compact disc rewinder.
3,Universal 38036 Shredder Lubricant Sheets,These work Okay but have not done the job as expected.I now send all paper to a professional shredder.
4,Shredder lubricant sheets,Excellent product. After about one week I noticed that my six year old shredder was not so noisy - sounded more like when it was new. Most people don't realize that these shredder lubricant sheets are available. Just like any mechanical device shredders must be serviced periodically. Don't expect one of these lubricant sheets to do the job immediately. Follow the simple instructions on the sheet. This item is a must for all new and existing shredder owners.
4,Great Inexpensive Swing,"Don't confuse this swing with ones selling for two and three times the price (or more). It wasn't made to last a lifetime, and it isn't constructed of heavy duty materials. My wife and I together weigh about 300 pounds, and we feel comfortable and safe in it, but I wouldn't if we weighed more than another 100 pounds. After a year outdoors, the original finish is pretty well worn off, and we were considering refinishing but decided we like the greyish patina the wood is taking on.On the plus side, it is lightweight, attractive and very easy to assemble. I can easily move it myself when mowing the lawn, rather than try to trim around it. And, of course, the price is right!"
4,good value,"quite easy to assemble. it took me shy of 2 hours. The instruction was Ok -- before tighten all the screws, you better try put them together loosely, in case you make any mistake.Once assembled, it's quite sturdy. parts fit together very well. water could penetrate so I applied a coat of clear waterproof paint myself. I wish I had applied the waterproof coat before assembling.Overall, good value. <$200 price is nice. Shipping and package were fine."
4,cant wait for the third book,I've probably read all of the X-men novels out and this trilogy is looking to be as good as the mutant empire one. THe first book set up a dictatorship with Doom and this one shows how Magneto's dream could work and shows sympathy for magneto because he only fight's for his dream. I have no idea how Roman will fix this situation because of the bleak ending. This isn't as action packed as the mutant empire trilogy but the intrigue and suspense is better.
4,"X-Men Doctor Doom (Chaos Engine, Book 1)","I liked this book!This book has many surprises. It's a real thriller. What I liked was that it wasn't a comic book story turned into a novel like what happened with some of the earlier Marvel novels. If I want a Marvel super heroes story in continuity then I'll pick up the comic book. One of the things I've always wanted to see in the Marvel novels is a writer having the courage to try new things. Steve Roman did just that--and he did a great job!It's a real page-turner. I've got some friends who read suspense books who look down on super hero books and I've been telling them to pick this one up because it's worth it!The only thing I don't like about the book is the fact that there are so many illustrations. I like Mark Buckingham's artwork, but I think that having all that art takes away from it being a book.Anyway, I hope to see more books like this--I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how Steve Roman finishes this trilogy."
3,So many questions answered,A wonderful trilogy that answers so many questions from Stoker's novel. Questions such as who were the 3 females that tormented Harker in Transylvania? and Who is Abraham Van Helsing and why is he so obsessed with the destruction of Dracula? and Why hadn't the peasants destroyed him in all these years? It was a glorious prequel that kept the same style and tone as Stoker's and that deeply enriched the Dracula legend.
2,Drained my will to live,"Okay, so I did read the whole thing. I found the content slow, ill-written, and shamelessly two-dimensional. The only reason I gave it two stars was I can't possibly think that any book would deserve just one. Ms. Kalogridis attempts to mimic Stoker's style (the fact the book is written diary-like) but it would have been just as well to write in third person. Stoker's was believable, this one is just boring. The only excitement occurs in the last chapter and it's really a dismal attempt to ""shock"" the reader. It fails. The book helped kill time, but so would reading an encyclopedia. Overall, just a bad book."
4,Something new here! Better than expected!,"I really thought I'd be bored with a retelling (I thought) of this family Dracula tale... boy was I wrong. Before I knew what hit me I'd finished the book. My only complaint, and the reason I gave it four stars vs. five, was that it was very very short, and I felt the three books should have been one masterpiece of a novel. There really was new vampire material here, very interesting background, and something to sink your teeth into! I've read two of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake books, and this book was better. I've also read all the Anne Rice novels and while this book was not on a par with their complexity, it was still very good,new,original, and different."
3,high cheese factor,"as far as french robotic funk dance music goes, it doesn't get much better than this. the songs ""One More Time"" & ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" are so infectious that you can't help but want to dance in a silly robotic sort of way. they are not only good goofy dancefloor anthems, but they are well crafted pop songs. the rest of the album is here and there. i like the haunting 2001 Space Odyssey style electronic moods of ""Crescendolls"" and ""Verdis Quo"", but there are plenty of songs that just sound like Daft Punk by the numbers such as ""Digital Love"", ""High Life"", and ""Too Long."" yes...just a bit too long. an appreciation of high cheese factor is needed to properly go along with the flow of this album, but when that flow is there, most of these songs seem pretty unstoppable."
4,"""Discovery"" = very disco.","It took me a few years to get ""Around The World"" out of my head, only to be replaced by ""One More Time"". What an excellent disc. Any fan of music over the past two decades should find something to like here, other than maybe country. It's kind of like putting ""Van Halen"", ""Kool And The Gang"", ""KMFDM"", and ""Madonna"" into a blender. That's ""Daft Punk"", simultaneously fresh and retro. Not every track here is a winner, but overall it's a nice ride. It'll definitely get you on your feet. ""Digital Love"" and ""Veridis Quo"" are two of my faves. These robots rock."
5,this album is for everyone!,"most underrated album of 2001 easily.the cartoon video clips and 70s sound confused everyone ""is this daft punk? what are they doing?""what you need to know:* this album will make you dance, even if (like me) you ""don't"" dance.* there aint a dud on itwhat may interest you:* the film accompanying the album called ""Interstellar 5555"" hinted at how great this album is. itwill be out on dvd 2004 hopefully* i discovered the joy of this album two days ago, when i finally bought it.*daft punk seem to be on a hiatus, this album was largely ignored due to the strange video clips.there is no better album to waste your money on. I can't get mine out of the CD player.if ""insterstellar 5555"" comes to your local film festival go see it! audiences leave wide-eyed!"
2,Better Than The First One But Still Only For Fans,"Daft Punk's second release is better than their debut, and yet it is only for fans of this kind of electronic music, or soft techno.It was recommended to me because I, despite my rejection of this musical genre, fell for the other French band 'Air'. But Daft Punk is less soulful and more electronically sterile. Still, the variation in the songs is remarkably high - my compliment for that.Songs like 'Veridis Quo' and 'One More Time' do possess a certain charm. But for an old rock fan like me, it is far from enough to justify a buy."
1,"Sorry, but these guys really suck....","If you are seriously considering Daft Junk, then just go ahead and waste your money on Britney or Madonna....."
1,Embarassing and horrendous,"This music is HORRIBLE. Okay, so 'Homework' had some quirky, fun tracks, (some cheesey tracks too), and some surprisingly hard tracks. The French aren't known for their music, but I was very impressed.When this came out I hoped it would offer more of the same: A few cheese tracks, but a few great ones thrown in. Apparently not. These guys must have had a change of taste in music. This album is one of the worst things I've ever heard.The first time I heard 'one more time' I thought it must not be the same band. Once I realized it was the 'Daftlies' I was still hoping that track was just the bad song off the record and the rest were better. No..... they are all as bad. I mean, this album is BAD."
3,High's and low's....worth having,"I remember when I first got this, I couldn't stop listening to ""one more time"". I just thought it was the best french disco house to come out in a long time. Well, if you haven't heard that track (which is near impossible since there are 3 commericals I can think of with daft punk tracks: victoria's secret - uses ""one more time"", palm pilot - ""harder, better, faster, stronger"", and a gap - ""aerodynamic""), get this cd b/c you will like it.Notable tracks:one more timeaerodynamiccrescendollssomething about usvoyagerIt's a pretty darn solid cd with some great tracks to mix in your set. Buy, press play, have fun."
3,disco-blech,this album has more kitsch appeal than actual listening value. sounds like a collaboration between eiffel 65 and tangerine dream. the retro sound is intended but loses it charm after a few listens.the raw beat box sound of 'homework' has given way to eurodiscocheese.
2,This is not real techno,"Daft Punk is another one of those bands that will always be filed under ""techno"" or ""dance"" without real justification. Sure, maybe the music is purely electronic...but this album belongs in the R & B or popular sections of music stores. Musically, Discovery doesn't impress me very much. The video for One More Time is interesting, but the song by itself isn't anything to get excited about. Most of the album chugs along at a slow pace, and I like my electronic music fast and intelligent. If you want some real techno, check out artists like Astral Projection, Man With No Name, and even Evil's Toy or Funker Vogt."
2,"Disco is Disco, Trance is Trance","I probably should have listened to this album before actually purchasing it, but I guessed that my admiration for the past work of the Daft Punk duo would suffice as a recommendation. I guessed wrong. Apparently they decided to mix disco into trance and come up with an amazing compilation. What they ended up with was a list of candy-coated nothing. None of the great anthemic house/trance/techno stlyes are here, with the exception of a few light beats near the end of the CD. Everything else features trite vocals and slap-base. Don't get me wrong, I like disco music, and I like trance music. But ""Discovery"" attempts to intertwine the two without sucess. Pass this one up unless a project with Kool and the Gang, Ford, and Diana Ross sounds attractive to you. This is the first Daft Punk album that I felt embarrased to have running when waiting at stop lights."
2,Annoyingly Stessful,Only good song is Harder Better Faster Stronger. The rest of the album just annoys me. Too much repetitive beats and noises... it was causing me to stress out instead of getting in the zone. Didn't really take me anywhere except a loop. If you must sample the songs and buy à la carte.
3,"Mmmm, kinda wierd","Ok, maybe I wa just expecting something different. But I always try new stuff so I picked this one up. I thought it was friggin weird. Like some cosmic sounds and hardly any bass or electronic sounds at all. I am into the jungle bass and techno sounds of groups like The Prodigy, Praga Khan, Chemical Brothers, Channel X and Propellerheads. This is also dance music, but nothing like I expected. One more time was pretty good, but the rest kinda put me to sleep. Maybe I need to listen to it again, cuz everyone else seemed to think it was great."
5,robert anderson....have you ever been outside of the USA?,"you are a GRINGOLOCO FUNNYSTUFF?, and i want to see your knowledge about this record because, you don't know anything about this work,i'm not a fan, i just want to make you a question brother! ....when has a european album become popular in the USA?this album is the spirit of daft punk, maybe, the most personal album ever made.(influences of early days). grow up man!"
2,Disappointing,"If you liked Daft Punk's classic album ""Homework"", you'll probably hate this. I loved ""Homework"" when it came out, but when I first heard some of the tracks from this new album I could barely beleive what I was hearing. Many of the tracks on ""Discovery"" sound like an embarrassing parody of their old stuff. I bought the album anyway after reading the reviews, and on the first play I enjoyed it, but then I played it again and realised that there is very little origninal material on this new album. On top of that, many of these track just won't get played in a club because of the embarrassing 80-style production, obnoxious and cheesy vocals, and breakdowns left, right and centre. There are about three good tracks here, the rest contain some great daft punk sampling techniques but they need to be completely remixed. The raw, underground sound of ""Homework"" is gone aswell. Disappointment of the year!!"
2,Can't Believe I Wasted the CDR,"OK HouseWork was cool 4-5 star, enough said. Discovery noteven close, seems like a ... cop out to earn a quick buck on Daft Punks Part. A lot of cheesy breaks and fillers, time killers etc etc. I'm pretty discusted that so many people gave this a decent review!Doesn't anyone here listen to good music?"
3,robots gonna work it out....,"first album was a blast....no track here will equal ""around the world"" or ""alive"", but as an album works well. i think people will love or loathe it. i can't help feeling a little underwhelmed. still there's some great tracks (aside from the opening ""one more time"" which is a little too euro-poppy): ""digital love"", ""cresendolls"", ""short circuit"". a brave album considering what everyone was expecting after homework. asks us not to bring too much into listening, what we like we like we don't need to know why. cheese reevaluated. and it almost succeeds."
4,10x better than the last one!,"One More Time-5/5-This is one of the best dance songs i've ever heardAerodynamic-5/5-Just as cool as One More TimeDigital Love-3/5-Ok...Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger-This is THE BEST, next to One More TimeCrescendolls-4/5-This is good, but it kinda gets annoying cuz it does the same thing over and over again....Nightvision-4/5-This would get a five if it was a little longer...it would make a great slow songSuperheroes-5/5-Another great songHigh Life-3/5-Just like Crescendolls, this kind of gets annoyingSomething About us-4/5-This is also a good slow song...Voyager-5/5-This is my favorite...Veridis Quo-4/5-This is good once it gets goingShort Circuit-3/5-Pretty good...Face to Face-4/5-This is another one of my favorites ( i have lots)Too Long-2/5-This song takes Too Long to get going...like 5 minutes...They could've done this one a lot better...but once it gets going, it's pretty good..."
5,Daft Punk are one of the best..........,"What is the deal of comparing Daft Punk to Eiffel 65? Everyone is doing the vocoded vocals. But only the best know now to do it right. Sure maybe this is no ""Homework"", but I think the right decision was made in going in a different direction with this album. If they had replicated ""Homework"" then people would have criticized them for sounding the same. You can never make people happy. As for Discovery, this is a wicked LP. From the opening track of ""One More Time"" to the last track ""Too Long"", this album shines. The only flaw I found on this album was the track ""Short Circuit"". This track seems out of place as much of the album is disco-house music. If you're into house music, give this record a spin. It may not be for everyone, but I dare you to listen to ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger and NOT be able to start tapping your feet!!"
4,"Harder, Faster, And Almost as Strong...","I've been waiting for this Daft CD for months now. Everyone seems to either hate this CD, or love it. Yes, it is different, and yes, some of these tracks won't show up in your favorite club until they are remixed...but this album is beautiful. One More Time is a cheesy anthem. Get ready to hear it at all the club baby's weddings. It will replace Kool and the Gang's Celebrate. Aerodynamic is by far the best song on this album, and with a good remix, and some extra time on it, it will keep you bumpin for a while. I believe Harder Faster Stronger is a gem of song on this album. I heard FatBoy Slim add it into his mix this weekend at the Comic Relief benefit..its bleeds bass. Overall, be prepared to hear a retro-disco lovin, 80's splash of house. I give this album 4 stars because some of these tracks arent long enough. They need more time. Oh, and fellas, get rid of the Robot uniforms...its time to Grow up. This album definetly proved you're ready."
4,"More ""Funk""","I kinda have a hard time grabbing the whole ""Disco Funk"" brand of ""Electronica"", but Daft Punk love what they do and I like them for that! ""One More Time"", is definitly the high point of the CD, buy 'ya know, this CD is fun. If you liked ""Homework"", you will probably like this album better. If you like ""One More Time"", you will love this CD."
3,"+-,that's the best way to describe it","Discovery has some really fine moments:Digital Love(probably their best track),Nightvision,Superheroes and High Life show Daft Punk at their creative best.The big hit One More Time is of course also very good,a true sing along.But there are some tracks that are kind of a waste.Crescendolls,Face to Face and Too Long are just not good enough.Too Long is of course funny when you hear it the first time but it gets annoying after that.Still,an above average dance album."
5,Great buy,"This is a great CD to get you up-and-going or lift your mood, if you like a dance music. Creative music, similar to New Order."
2,One of the best Dance Albums ever,"I really liked homework but I thought its one major downfall was the fact that it's tracks were all much too long. Then came ""One More Time"" and to be honest it took a while to grow on me. But ""Aerodynamic"" - what a tune!!!! That, and I heard a few of the other tracks and then I had to get this album. Even on the first listen, all the tracks sound incredably individual and when they grow on you, you just know this is something special. My favourite track has got to be ""Digital Love"" though. it manages to remind of everything that was great about the 80's in three minutes of great music.You could point out some of the more downbeat tracks as letting it down to a point, but with it being so hard to write a solid dance album they cant really be blamed.PS. The videos are GREAT"
2,Boring!,"Redundant beats and simple production make this a BAD purchase. It's only saving grace was Bigger, Faster...etc.Don't waste your money."
3,"Excellent Album, Bad Batch of Records","I love Daft Punk. I love Discovery. I love Vinyl.Unfortunately, after receiving my copy of this record, I found a rather unpleasant click/pop that occurred at the beginning of Aerodynamic. This click consistently happened at each revolution and could be heard in the quieter parts of Aerodynamic and the beginning of Digital Love. I exchanged my first copy for another copy. Unfortunately, the same clicking occurred in the same spots. I troubleshooted my Turntable with many other records, including Side B of the one producing the problem. Every other record is fine.I don't know if there was just a bad run of this Vinyl, but be careful when you order it. I'm not saying it'll happen to you, but perhaps consider buying it used or from a local store where.To clarify, I borrowed my friend's copy of Discovery and the clicking/popping did not occur as in my two copies!"
3,It Is Alright...but nothing more,"When people state that this Album ""sucks"", they are in some ways right. This album was below my expectations as I highly anticipated it and when i heard it i was severely disspointed. It DEFINATELY could cut out the vocoder effects or vocals entirely for that matter and jsut go back to their Homework days."
4,"I liked it, you might too..","Daft Punk, the French duo Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel De Homem-Christo, (ANOTHER good French band, its getting scary) are often compared to Electric Light Orchestra, Kraftwerk and Gary Numan and that is pretty accurate. You've heard their music before, remember that Gap commercial with the two dancing robots? That's them dancing to their song ""Digital Love"", which is the third track on this CD. It's a great tune, not as funky as the Crystal Method or as hard-hitting as The Chemical Brothers But just as good. This CD is not perfect, a couple of tunes on it are a little too simplistic but overall I really enjoyed it."""
5,daft punk rocks,"I personally love this album. I could listen to it over and over and not get tired of it. Aerodynamic is a definate favorite followed by Harder, better, stronger, faster. Actually...I just love the whole album. And if you get a chance, watch Interstella 5555. Totally worth it, it's a cartoon (animeish) to this whole album."
3,electro disco,"I've never been a fan of Daft Punk and I don't have their first album, but for some reason I bought their latest ""discovery"" and I'm not dissappointed. It starts off with the smash ""one more time"" (which is the best song on the album) and ends with the much too long ""too long"" (which is about 10 mins long). Discovery is filled with disco infused beats, vocoder effects, and electronic synths. All in all it's a positive, uplifting dance album that's sure to make you get up and dance."
2,"Man, is this repetitive","I'm not a big dance music fan, so maybe others won't mind. But I guess this CD is made for dancing, not for listening to, because boy does each song go on for way too long."
4,A Rock fan salutes this dance and disco album,"I've been a rock fan my whole life so far. And I've got to say, for being a dance music kind of group, this stuff is pretty darn good. Daft Punk has some of the best vocals that I've ever heard.The synthesized music is great too. So, I'm begging those merciful rock fans out there, give this album achance. You might like it. I recomend this CD to Dance music veterans and new comers too."
1,"Should have downloaded the MP3 of ""One More Time"" instead...","That was really the only worthwhile track on the CD. This purchase confirmed my sneaking suspicion (obtained via several vain attempts to have a good time clubbing in France) -- i.e., the French do not rock."
1,wha??,"Snoooooooooooooooooooooooooze. Party album? I'd hate to be atTHAT party then. Boring album considering why I purchased it. There'sa couple great parts, but usually ended by something slow. For DaftPunk, I'm disappointed...."
2,Utterly Overrated,"I've never understood the appeal of Daft Punk. ""Around the World"" is probably the only track by them that I like. Everyone raved about this album the week it was released and the catchy, ""One More Time"" hit the airways chronically.Of course I bought it that week also, and probably thought a little (but not by much) more strongly about it at the time. Listening to this album today on the other hand, truly unmasks how aweful it really is. Daft Punk may know how to create a few tracks that will make it into the pop top 40, but these guys have very little talent when it comes to quality electronica.2/5 stars."
4,This is the best cd ever!!!,"I think that Discovery is a great cd, except that only the first 5 songs are good. One more time has great music, and great words, but is kinda repetative. I still like it. Digital Love is ok, but it is kind of silly in the begining. Aerodynamic is an AMAZING song. with the mix of techno guitar, techno percussion, and sfx, its the secound best song on the whole cd. Harder, better, faster, stronger is the all time best song i have ever heard. Between the music, the techno voice, and sfx, i love it. I especcially like the part after the chorus (work it harder, make it better, do it faster makes us stronger, holin never power faster, hour work is never over), and the part after that, where they morf the voice with a guitar. Crecendolls is very good, and it has the 2nd best music on the cd (Aerodynamic gets 1st place), but the words are a little strange. I give it 4 stars, only because only the 1st 5 songs are good. But it still is a great cd."
4,Excellent new music!,"What a find! I came across this artist on the radio one day and couldn't wait to run out and buy their cd. Each track is fun to listen to, very upbeat and infectious. Dance, exercise, drive or just relax to the sound. You will enjoy this music whether or not you are a fan of new music and it will be one you'll keep on hand in your disk changer for a while."
4,Unique,"I kinda bought this album on a whim, which i dont normally do, and am glad I did so. Discovery turned out to be exactly what my CD collection needed, something a little different, fun, up-beat, and unique. My favorites are ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" for its free-for-all funk, and ""Something about Us"" because of it's smooth R&B groove, and ""Face to Face"" with a little 80's retro funk. Daft Punk's style seems to be an ingenious blend of disco, house, funk and electronica. It can always put me in a good mood! I love it!"
5,I wish this CD were there when...,"I am not really into the whole techno scene, but I personally love Daft Punk.I was hooked when I saw the story their four videos show (One More Time, Aerodynamic, Digital Love; and Harder, Better...).When I first heard this CD I almost lost it. This is the perfect music to have a a dance, and my 8th grade farewell dance had happened just a week before.The techno beats and funky lyrics make this CD a must buy for everyone who is even the slightest bit into the techno scene, and if you are a DJ dont get caught without it."
5,veritas,"Honestly, I tend to like house and think this sort of techno is good to listen to but not good music. However, this Daft Punk album is undisputedly fun to listen/dance to, and actually a very skillfully done blend. My favorites are Veridis quo-meaningfully melodic- and Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger-insane robot voice"
4,Daft Punk Takes On... Disco!,"This was the album that launched Daft Punk into the mainstream. Runaway success hits like ""One More Time"", ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", and ""Digital Love"" appealed to the music lovers who weren't even fond of their debut. Make no mistake, this is Daft Punk for the mainstream audience. Its here on Discovery that you hear them deviate away from their signature style of pounding house beats coupled with catchy grooves and replaces it with melodic synths and emotional vocoder-treated verse/chorus lyrics. Fortunately, that doesn't matter too much because at its core, its still good music. Its the first time that you could say Daft Punk's music almost sounds... how should we put it?... Cute... like a robot puppy dog. For those who favor Homework, there's still something to love here. ""Superheroes"" is a powerful track with a catchy repeating vocal sample (""Somethings in the air"") that will have you recalling the energy that Homework had."
5,great album,"Great album but feels a little funkier than the rest. I think tracks 1,2,4,9,14 are pretty much a classic at this point. I would highly recommend checking out their other albums. Here are some of their best albums in my opinion: [...]"
5,!!!!!!!!!,"At a first glimpse of this cd, I thought it was good, but not the best. After listening to the simplicity of each track, I started to realize, this is what made the cd great and unique. Normally, I am into the very complex beats of techno and d&b and scorn any music created without the heavy duty equipment and gear; but such music, though very up-tempo, doesn't quite move me emotionally as some of the tracks do here, and make me want to listen to them more and more to the point that I become eager for the end of the day to hear it one more time. The downfall is that the songs may loop inside your head over and over 'til it either drives you insane or you can't concentrate on anything else because you are so hooked. Also, if you are in a techno! techno! only techno! phase, this may not be your cup of tea. With an open mind and willingness for some corny yet addictive synthesized disco style beat, this may become your favourite cd."
5,this cd is the coolest,This is the coolest album with dance music ever so if you like dance music get this album
1,the worst cd ever.,"after having homework as my soundrack, you could imagine my excitement when i heard daft punk was releasing a new album. so i bought this, and i had never been more disappointed. i can't even give this cd away it's so bad. it is nothing like homework. daft punk sold out and this cd is commercial. i hope they get their act together and go back to their roots!"
1,It's no Homework,"This album has no soul, no funk, and sounds too much like Eiffel 64. What were they thinking? Trying to sell more records? Make more money? Homework is the album. Discovery is just bad."
3,It's alright.,When I first listened to this album I was in shock and thought it might be some kind of practical joke. It sounds like they are going for an early 80's light FM sound.There is nothing really that groundbreaking or even that cool about it for that matter. Its all kind of cheesey and lame....but the more I listen to it the more I like it and it isn't that bad. Maybe in a couple of weeks I will think its the best album ever(I doubt it). I do respect them for having a sense of humour though and I guess if they can take this genre of music (easy listening supermarket music)) and make it cutting edge then they are way ahead of their time.
4,okay fun,"A lot was expected of Daft Punk, despite the fact their track record was brief. ""Discovery"" shows them moving on, which is something to be grateful for, but it still doesn't live up to all the hype. Appropriating 70s influences doesn't necessarily guarantee quality tunes, especially when they're Supertramp (!!), but DP at least does it with wit and style. In short, a great sounding record with some great and some average hooks."
5,Techno-Funk-Pop-Disco,This cd is an amazing mix of many music styles all with awesome techno mixing and most with cool lyriks. Techno fan? Disco fan? Euro-Dance fan? Pop fan? Funk fan? Punk fan? THIS CD IS FOR YOU
4,WHAT I THINK ABOUT DAFT PUNK,well i think this is a good cd if you like to dance. my fav track is #4 harder baetter faster stronger. that was a good track cause its really hyper and it gives you a vive you know? well like i said buy this only if you want to throw partys and dance your thoughts away. and i think that coming from me its good cause im picky when it comes to danceing music well i give it a 4.5 and its pretty good. peace out
3,all right overview,"If you are new to the Beats, this is a pretty good overview of them. Things that make this book stand out are the pictures, which are not all the usual ones, and the ""where are they now"" section in the back of the book. But really, could it hurt to do a bit more editing? I mean, I found several typos, and, according to this book, Jan Kerouac died in 1966, three years before her father...."
2,Do not buy this for the cougar,This is for a beretta 92 slip over front sight that requires precise drilling. If you want a cougar night sight buy trijicon. Also seller will not reply to messages. I am going to keep this for my model 96. I have the equipment to perform the precise drilling necessary to mount this. If I only knew.
3,Used Book,"I was unable to contact the seller by email address listed on amazon (zero phone info) to ask about expidited shipping. It took over a week to arrive, but the book was in very good condition."
3,"Good plot, but...","I will give this one a generous 3 stars because the plot was good. Valerie must keep the old lodge she has inherited because a handsome ghost keeps reappearing over the years when the aurora borealis reaches a certain zenith. However, the strong plot could not seem to hold up as the characters got weaker and weaker. I got tired of Valerie allowing the abusive ex-boyfriend to come around ""one last time,"" even the morning after making love to Jack (the handsome ghost). The book seemed to lose ground the further I read. Sorry. Readers are welcome to disagree with me."
1,Just a long ad,"I had no idea that this book would be just a very long-winded advertisement for one specific garlic supplement. I donated this useless, promotional joke of a book to the local library."
2,more epicrap,"wow. lots of melodic ""punk"" music here. all the radio and mtv bands all the skater kids know and love. gas huffer and total chaos are the only bright spots on this otherwise dismal disc."
3,PUNK-O-RAMMA 2,"This cd is O.K. Offspring is NOT punk and the only reason I gave this cd 3 stars is because rancid rules, and I WANNA RIOT is one of their best songs."
3,its cools,it has all of the good band that you can get but it just doesnt have enough songs. still it is worth to buy.
3,ok.....cd,mai cuz got this cd for me at a music shop and i listenined to it and i liked it but then i listened to it again and again and i just couldnt get that vibe as i did with the other punk o ramas so if u want a good punk o rama get the 3 or 5 ones there the best... P.S. the offspring are punk they just might be that heavy punk that everybody wants out of this album-
3,Hi my name is Julie,"I like this web site but it needs something and I think it needsmore punk bands, and since I already signed in I would like tosuggest some bands. If I could, I suggest that you put pennywise, pasta rocket, 1208, etc. I think you know which CD im talking about. In case you dont its called ""off the wall"" and I think its volume 4. Im not sure because I dont know how to readroman numerals, but the first song is Enemy by Pennywise.well thats it.thank you for your cooperation,Julie Ramos"
3,Brophy elevates this well beyond where it would have been,"Adrian Brophy plays a hard luck veteran and he is excellent in the lead role here. The rest of the performances are also good and you wish Kristofferson and Leigh had a little more time to flesh out their characters. They're just not working with Acadeny Award type material here.The script goes back and forth from 1992 to 2007 and making sense of it is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle. The film has a knack of switching to something else just when you get interested in a character or scene.Having seen Brophy act in a number of different parts now, it is very apparent that he is one of our better young actors today and without him, this film would be a turkey."
3,a hollywood blend...,"Perhaps I'm being a little harsh with only 3 stars - but i felt something needed to be said about the many flaws within this movie...First of all this review isn't going to moan about the supposed ending or pretentiously what 'I' think happens - that is best left for personal opinion - everyone is going to view the film differently.The main issue i had with the film is that although the idea has potential - I didn't feel that it was reached fully within this film. The theme of time-travel is one that countless films have attempted, and so the very 'safe' approach that 'the jacket' takes, gives you somewhat dejavu. The film is a blend of unoriginal ideas taken from classics such as 'one flew over the cuckoos nest', 'jacob's ladder' and 'twelve monkeys', but alas lacks in the depth that these great movies had.Definately worth watching, but don't expect anything special...but look out for Daniel Craig's role - that is definately worth watching for!!"
3,...leaves you wondering well after it's over....,This movie is very well done and reminds me of other good films such as JACOB'S LADDER and DONNIE DARKO. It keeps you thinking throughout and leaves you wondering what is going on well after it's over. Watch it with an open mind.
3,Worth a watch,"The Jacket is the second movie I've seen recently where a film, for marketing reasons, has been packaged as something else (the other being Wicker Park). I hope this isn't a trend. Fortunately The Jacket is a much better movie, elevated by some fine acting from Adrian Brody (not to mention a great supporting cast). That's not to say the movie doesn't have problems, but I'm not sure if this is a weakness -- or just the story itself. Fragmented telling in film is always a high-wire act. On the page, it may read well, but in a film if you don't do it right, you lose the audience pretty quickly. That doesn't happen in The Jacket, since Brody's performance is the glue that holds the (past and present) pieces together. So much so that the feel-good ending, which runs the risk of selling out, actually works. If you liked the Sixth Sense (though I wouldn't call The Jacket a supernatural film) , you should like The Jacket. Not a great movie, but certainly not a bad one."
1,I guess I'm odd (wo)man out.,"I really disliked this movie. It reminded me a lot of Jacob's Ladder, only without the plot, the message, or the gritty feel. It just didn't make any sense, didn't seem to go anywhere, and was overall just weak. I was already searching for something after the first half hour, and never found it.The plot, though intentionally disjointed, didn't make any sense, and the characters were mechanical and shallow - not believable at all.This is the worst movie I've seen since Alone in the Dark."
1,Waste of time!,When I read through some of the 5 ***** star reviews I have to strain to see the resemblance that the movie that these people are describing to the one that was on my DVD. This movie has a plot that makes no sense and character development that is to say the least very weak. In the end you are left feeling like you just wasted an hour of you life.
1,WHEN YOU DIE YOU GET TO BE A TIME TRAVELLER,"That's it. Yup, really. The whole movie long you wait for the twist, the explanation you didn't see coming but explains everything, like fight club or eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, psycho, you know, good movies like those. Nope. Not this one. When you die you get to travel to the future. That's it. That's your explanation."
1,Stylized mess,"Style over substance. Filled with cliches and jarring imagery, the movie drags on through Jack Starks' time travelling adventure. Like many reviewers pointed out, Jack's wartime past apparently has no connection to the story except for the amnesia causing injury (May be it made him subconcisuly cynical, your guess is as good as mine). How a morgue drawer helps Jack timetravel to the future, I have no clue... Another absurdity is how Jack learns about that Babak kid from Jennifer Leigh (of the future) and repeats to the Jennifer Leigh (in the present). Excuse me, but where is this knowledge oriniating from? Even B movies on sci-fi channel handle time traveling condundrums better. Do yourself a favour and take a pass. This is not worth it."
2,Go buy Jacobs ladder .....,"This is a cheap rip off of Jacob Ladder Starring tim robbins.TThe acting is ok, the girl who plays Jackie is not a great actress and is actually very annoying to watch well for me atleast. What i dont get is she picks up this guy off the street and brings him home not knowing him and tells him to sleep over , while she sleeps in the other room. Who in there right mind would do that. Anyway i didnt like this movie.Most will like the movie i mean its an ok movie but just reminds me to much of a movie made from taking ideas from other great movie."
5,perfect,Product came as specified and very fast. I was very pleased with the shipment method and packaging. Definitely returning customer when needing more product.
4,Worth Watching,"I liked that this was a dark ""thinker"" type movie. I watched this movies with no expectations, because I've never heard of it before I saw it on TV.I like this style of movie. The script wasn't the greatest but the acting was still ok."
1,They Ripped Off Jack London,"It is a shame they didn't give a nod to Jack London, whose last novel, ""The Star Rover,"" was blatantly ripped off for this plot. Unfortunately, the tributary this movie takes once it veers from London's original premise was vastly less interesting. London was a genius; this screenwriter a piker."
1,YAWN!! BORING!,"Yea, the acting might be great, but if the movie isn't entertaining, who cares?? This movie is a complete waste of time."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","The Jacket brings to the screen the story of a Persian Gulf War veteran who ends up in an asylum for the criminally insane for a crime that he didn't commit. However, all is not what it seems in the mental hospital...In short, the acting is pretty good, the plot is interesting (if not far fetched), while the dialogues are average and sometimes below average.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top. No masterpiece here."
4,Better than you would think,"Maybe it was the advertising that killed this movie in the theatre before it even got a fair chance. I saw this before it was released at the Sundance film festival and knew that it would be a hard one to sell to people not because it wasn't good but because it didn't fit in to a usual Hollywood classification. Sure enough, I was right. They made it look like a horror movie and it is definitely not that. I'd call it a thriller with sci fi overtones. Sort of a Twilight Zone episode if you had to label it.Great performances by a strong cast plus an interesting plot propel this over most movies that come out in the theatres these days. In some respects it's even better than The Butterfly Effect (which had a simular plot) especially because it has a strong lead where as B.E did not.Given a chance with different marketing this could have been big. So check it out on DVD now!"
4,Much better than the trailer looks...,"I must agree with the previous reviewer...the trailer looks like a horror movie, but this is actually a very facinating movie. I'm a complete chicken (don't like horror movies) and I found this movie to be very engrossing. Probably not for everyone (my wife wouldn't like it, I think...), but if you like modern fiction with a twist, this is the movie for you."
4,"Good movie, but too many holes...","I really enjoyed the movie a lot until the end. it just left to many questions. Like, why would they do that. Or what just happened and why. Almost a really good movie, but they killed it with the ending.....Definitly worth watching though....."
4,The Jacket,"I quite liked this film, it really makes you think about mental illness from the perspective of the patient and gives an insight into the world seen through their eyes. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Adrien Brody gave a very good performance and Keira Knightley shows her versatility as an actress in a challenging role. She is so talented (and gorgeous!) and this film just another reason why she is so successful! I also liked the fact that the outcome of the movie is not predictable...well done!"
4,A JACKET YOU CAN DO WITHOUT,"I enjoyed this movie. It's not a happy movie, but it's wellmade, and the acting is very good. The movie was a littleconfusing here and there, but still very good. The last 10movies I rented on line all sucked, so this was a pleasantsurprise! If you're clostraphobic, take some deep breathsbefore you watch this movie! I like the way it ended too."
3,"A Day Watching This One Is Better Than A Day At Work, But Barely.","This movie was watched on an afternoon where I was not at work. I wished I was at work because work makes my head hurt less than this movie did. It involves a Gulf War veteran who comes home and is framed for the death of a state trooper. He cannot explain what happened, and he is locked up for being criminally insane. When he is being treated he is locked in the morgue, but while he is he begins to travel through time. He gets a girlfriend, but she is someone he met when he is nine. It is all very complex, but that is not the problem. The problem is not bad acting. It is bad filming and poor editing. Heck, even Knightly is good. If you find this on TV it is worth a watch, but not worth buying."
4,I think less is more,"I think the stripped down feel of this album suits Charlie well. He's still playing bass with that 8th string. There are still times he sounds more like he's playing the organ instead of the guitar. However, there's more of an overall ""guitar"" sound. Also there's a variety of styles and bit of a harder edge to the proceedings. A very fine effort that shows Charlie belongs in the same league as ""Sco"", Metheny and Frisell."
4,Interesting Historical Curiosity,"Contemporary listeners would probably not understand why these songs were considered risque, given the lyrics of today's music (especially rap). The recording are surprisingly well preserved, considering they were recorded about eighty years ago. Unfortunately, musical styles have changed a lot and most of these artists are an acquired taste. One exception was Sophie Tucker."
4,"For out-of-towners, and that's good!","The Playnes' TIMELINE HISTORY OF NEW YORK CITY is a convenient guide through New York's long and rich history. For most New Yorkers, there's nothing really new here; we've all heard it before. And a lot of the information just touches the surface of some of the historic moments; too many of the reasons for the events that created the history, and their ramifications for the rest of America, are glossed over. That said, this timeline is still of value (especially for the price). It does contain a lot of information, given its size. In that regard, I would recommend this to those who are just starting their voyage to the City's history. I also think that people from out of town would appreciate this compact publication, especially if their planning a trip to the Big Smear."
4,not as good as they claim,have used it several times doest have the pick up feel and the hook setting power
2,the great profile goes bolshy!,"a bizarre mixture of revenge and forgiveness set against the russian revolution of 1917, with john barrymore giving a dreadful performance as a wrongfully imprisoned soldier turned bolshevik. barrymore gave many fine performances (see ""jekyll & hyde"" or ""beloved rogue"" in silents, or ""counsellor at law"" or ""20th century"" in talkies); this is not among them."
5,An excellent hands-on introduction to Java.,"This is an excellent hands-on tutorial that provides plenty of sample applications to get the novice to Java programming well under way. Each lesson is carefully prepared, well explained and is started by a list of objectives and followed by a lesson summary. I will be looking forward to future ""Rescued by"" books on related topics."
1,It did not fit my Hamilton Beach blender,It did not fit my Hamilton Beach blender. It is not the right size for this blender. no no no
2,Hamilton Beach Blender Gasket,The Hamilton Beach Blender Gasket was too big for my blender and it was costly. I wish that dimensions had been included in the description.Hamilton Beach Blender Gasket
1,Cheap construction but works,"While this product actually DOES clean glass surfaces with just plain 'ole tap water and the little cloth, it is CHEAP AND POORLY CONSTRUCTED.The handle does not hold steady. It constantly 'wriggles' which makes it hard to clean the corners of glass surfaces. Theoretically, one can hold the handle near to the base to prevent this (or maybe some super glue would work).If one still wants to buy this, stick with Amazon for the purchase. There's plenty of complaints about the bogus billing practices of the TV hawker website."
2,Hum Drum,This book was boring and predictable. I want to read a book I hate to put down and this certainly wasn't it.
4,A sincere album,"Many artists cut a Christmas album for the commercial value. On this heartfelt album, one gets the sense the Billy Dean is singing from a sincere Christian faith. There is a definite New Traditional Country feel, but it is so tastefully done, that the traditional carols are enhanced, not squeezed into the genre for the sake of a country music audience. Billy Dean has a pleasant voice, calm and relaxed. The duets add to the feeling of a family singing carols together in a loving Christmas tableau. It reminds me of those times each member of our family was ""required"" to bring their instruments to my mother-in-law's home for ""performances"" around the piano. This album may not become a classic, but it is certainly enjoyable and a worthwhile addition to the collection of anyone that loves Christmas music OR country music, a perfect blend."
4,good Christmas CD,Enjoyed some of the different versions of traditional Christmas songs. Always love to hear Billy Dean's voice. Would recommend this CD.
2,This item is a joke!!!,ordered from B&H; for $45.95+$5.15 on 1/10/07The construction of the legs is poor. It's spec to support for 5 kg.It is appear that the item can not even support itself.The leg broken on me at the first time use (not even slide in the camera in to the ball head yet).1 year Warranty for this product doesn't work too. I sent 3 email in the past 2 months requested replacements leg and never get respond.I am too worry to not add another $10 for ship the item back to the importer it may not get the item back. They not even return my email. :)So this item turn to be a joke item for my online order experience conversation.I will never buy product from this brand again.
2,Read it Only Once,"Liked this book when I skimmed it shortly after a rave review in NYTimes. Then re-read it recently in preparation for a class I was teaching. What was it I so didn't like? The tone: arrogant or self-enclosed? The vision: self-referential or too zealous. The writing itself: convoluted not clear. So, read it once for pleasure and do not pick it up again."
2,"cute, but useless","These would not stay on my son's feet. The faux-fur lining is very slick, and the slightest wriggling will knock them loose.These may work for a kid who's very, very still, but if they like to move and kick, you'll be lucky if the first bootie stays on long enough for you to put the second on their other foot."
1,Disappointed,"The shampoo was very watery , i do not know if received a 'bad' bottle. I threw the product away."
3,over priced for the content,Is a good bood but the manual that came with the program is just as good only this is a little bit more in depth for different options. I returned the book not worth the price
2,Complaint By Design,"This book seems to be written for a different version of PhotoDraw. I have Version 2, and it appears that a number of changes have been made which make following the exercises in the book difficult. The book which comes with the program is good enough."
4,"NOT A BAD ""DESIGN""","""Microsoft PhotoDraw 2000 By Design"" has some confusing hitches, but that doesn't matter much. It is not a bad book; and would go to a great length in explaining the patterns and the fundamentals of PhotoDraw.Its accompanying CD-ROM is cute. Wear a 'practice makes perfect' coat while using it."
3,Good fun and memories of saturday matinees,"Judy Canova was a very funny lady and made for this type of role. It brings back to mind sitting in the theater on a saturday morning and just enjoying a beautiful moving techicolor moving image while munching on popcorn. Our parents would go to the movies on saturday night, but the day time was all ours. Judy and Roy were our heros and even though we knew it was not real we welcomed the chance to escape with these kind of movies and we would not have had it any other way."
5,MUSE ............,NAZIMOVA ~ RAMBOVA ~ BRYANT!Eternally a startling version and vision of the Wilde play ~ brilliantly realized by Madame Nazimova [quite timeless in this avant-garde interpretation]. The piece moves along the lines of a Martha Graham concept with inspiration from Isadora Duncan perhaps.Visually? Impeccable design by Nathacha Rambova [Mrs. Rudolph Valentino] ~ possibly a note to Edward Gordon Craig's concept.In any case ~ this is still quite a breath-taking experience.Directed by Madame Nazimova's then husband ~ Charles Bryant.{Also a Great conversation piece - considering the 'legends' surrounding this production.}
4,primary yet not dry history,A great read for anyone interested in the social environment of the 49er. Turns popular misconceptions upside down about the barbarity of these Gold Rushers--they actually were quite civilized.
2,Not worth the money,"This book is not worth the money. Though very comprehensive (the sections on building a technical manual from scratch are informative), the book is woefully out of date. The writing is bone-dry, and there are now better reference books and better style guides that make the information more palatable. This book is a classic textbook: expensive, two colors (black and white) and impossible to read.If you only buy one or two books on tech writing, do not buy this one."
1,I agree with Casey,"Given Casey's reveiw, the publisher should be giving away the book for free and be willing to pay $5.00 to those who want it for a reference. I would wait until it hits the overstock book market where it can be picked up for cheap say a buck or so! Ordering through the mail at $3.99 add-on would be overpaying. The problem with publishing books on technical matters is that they become outdated by the time the book goes to press. Stuff like this should be published on the internet as a download PDF. The publisher, distributors, book agents etc all make on a deal like this so that the author is really left with peanuts. So why not publish it yourself? It's just my opinion."
1,Junk,Bought this extruded for my wife for our anniversary. The first time she attempted to use it the entire front popped off. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Horrible product!,"Listen to the previous reviewer -- he is spot on! I also bought this product a few months ago and it is a waste of money. The first time I used it, the front popped off as mentioned by the other reviewer. My engineer husband fixed it but the next time I used it, the opposite side popped off. Yet another fix, but then the original fix popped off again. Each time this has happened, I was using a very, very soft material which works fine in my tiny clay gun. I would recommend steering clear of this product. Complete waste of money."
2,I liked it fine.,It isn't strong enough for fondant unless it's warm. I need a strong extruder. It keeps falling apart on me.
4,Mike Rossi?,"I'm a big fan of Peyton Place and the sequel, but Mike Rossi? What happened to Tomas Makris? Was his name too Greek? And Grace changed not only the name but his dark personality in the sequel. Makris had a dark, violent side and an honesty that was full on sexy. In the sequel, he serves as the perfect companion for Connie, easy going with hardly a ripple of his original anger and bitterness of his past. It disappoints me Grace wimped out on his character. Also, since when was Connie in love with Allison's father? She was not. The sequel wasn't as good as the original, no doubt about it, but I still loved going back to Peyton Place with these characters."
1,Mediocre at best.,"Grace Metalious should have stopped after Peyton Place. The ""Return"" is very boring, does not add anything to the original story, and makes you wish you had never started it. It is too bad because Peyton Place was very enjoyable."
1,gadget,i really dont understand this thing. all it does it take up space in the cabinet. there is no reason to need to keep that much tea warm because if you're too lazy to just make some and drink it and then make some more fresh than youre probably too lazy to even make tea in teh first place!! you probably just bought some from starbucks or something. this is like selling a miniature microwave designed specifically for warming up cold old coffee
5,haunted Illinois,Love his books. I grew up in the area he writes about and I learned so much I didn't know. Would recommend his books.
3,"Ugh, Gurps.","Gurps is a horrible system. It is kludgy, it's obnoxious, and it is incredibly fidgety. Every game I've ever played has ended in frustration for everyone, as they realize that they can't, for instance, pick up a stick and hit someone with it, because they don't have the 'hitting people with sticks' skill, and so, despite being an amazing fighter, they turn into a clown.That being said, it is very versatile, for what it is, and it has a zillion ways to use it."
1,A Big Disappointment,"Like many of you, my 7 year old wanted this for Christmas. What a waste of money. I had the hardest time assembling it. The middle funnel which is suppose to pump the chocolate kept popping up, squirting syrup everywhere. What a big mess. And the syrup that you have to use, which we use to make chocolate milk, does not taste good with pretzels and other salt items. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my daughter still loves to play with it."
2,Messy,"YUK!!!! What a mess! My son got this for Christmas. He couldn't wait to use it. All I can say is put down the drop cloth, wear bibs and cover the table. It uses Chocolate milk syrup, which is way too thin. It dripped everywhere. The kids, ages seven and nine, weren't able to use the utensils that came with it. So they used their hands. I think we will stick to fondue."
2,Not As Easy To Do As They Say,"My daugther received The Real Chocolate Fountain as a gift for Christmas from Santa. I assembled the fountain toy with its easy-to-read instructions. We followed the directions, and when we turned it on, the machine seemed to function properly with the screw turning and the chocolate syrup moving around. However, the fountain itself never worked. I took everything apart and cleaned the washable parts and reassembled. Again the fountain part of the toy would not work. If we can't get this to work it will have to be returned to a store for a full refund."
1,not what it seems,"My 6 year old son wanted the chocolate fountain as soon as he saw the advertisement on television....not knowing it uses chocolate syrup instead of real chocolate. He used it once and has not asked to use it again. As for me, the cleanup was no picnic either. It has to be disassembled for cleanup and chocolate syrup goes into nooks and crannies not submergible in water....I was not impressed!"
1,Big disappointment,"My daughter was so excited to try this. After putting it together, pouring the syrup in, and turning it on, nothing happened. The screw in the middle was turning but the chocolate was not going anywhere. After several attempts to fix it (having to pour the chocolate in and out of the thing, and cleaning it each time)I put it back in the box and got my money back."
1,chocolate fountain does not work,"The chocolate fountain would not bring the chocolate up through the fountain. We followed the trouble shooting tips, but it would not work. It was a huge dissappointment."
1,Waste of Time and Money!!,"My son received the chocolate fountain as a gift for Christmas. I assembled the fountain with its simple instructions. The instructions and ease of putting it together was the best thing about this toy. We followed the directions, and when we turned it on, the ""screw"" that pulls the chocalate up, spun itself to a stop. I took everything apart and cleaned the washable parts and reassembled. Again the fountain would not work. I shouldn't be surprised. I have had other RoseArt products that do not work well. This will be returned to the store for a full refund, and I will not purchase another RoseArt product."
4,Our Boys LOVED it!!!,"Keep in mind this is a kids toy & not built to last very long...Our 4 young boys loved it. It's all about the GOO!. It's sticky, sweet, messy, moving, dripping chocolate. It gets everywhere, but that's what being a kid is all about. Herseys chocolate syrup works the best. If you get a syrup that is too thick, heat it up in the microwave to thin it out. We recommend using an ac adapter instead of batteries. It was on all Christmas day and the kids all kept coming back to it. Just be prepared for the sticky mess."
1,worst item to buy for a child,This product is not good for children. The product will only take chocolate syrup. It will not take any other type. Plus the chocolate does not come up and over the top like the picture. The children have to scrap their food over the plastic sides.
2,Over Priced,This item is over priced by 50% over Valley Forge Flag Co. You should buy direct from Valley Forge.
4,good,"The previous comment about price is incorrect since the comment is referring to a wholesaler (who sells to retailers and not directly to customers, and I know there are some people who don't understand why, but this is a necessary fact of life just the same as why you aren't going to be buying your lettuce directly from a farmer each week).And so back to reality, I just bought this set and am very satisfied and will be buying three other poles shortly (I have a lot of flags). The only thing I'm left wondering about is whether the kit would have been better with the flag with the end that wraps around the flagpole itself, and, I think the white parts of the flag should have a bit more depth to them so they would be whiter, but that is just the way nylon flags are, in my experience. I would have been willing to pay more for that since the flagpole itself is first rate.ThanksDave"
4,Flag kit,"Nice flag kit. The bearings in the flag pole keep the flag from getting twisted. It does work well and I hope it will last, the flagpole seems to be medium duty and the clips that hold the flag to the pole are plastic and seem to me to be the weak link. Time will tell. I would recommend trying it."
5,A First Rate Collection of Vintage Comedy!,"A funny, first rate collection of silent film comedy shorts.Silent stars Buster Keaton (One Week), Charlie Chaplin(Easy Street), Laurel and Hardy (Big Business), and Monty Banks(Chasing Choo-choos). The quality of the prints is the best we've seen, and the musical score is excellent by the Alloy Orchestra. It's a must have for Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy,Banks,and Chaplin Fans."
2,Music sucks,"It was NOT worth the price, and the electronic music was awful. Watch it muted if you get this. Quite a dissapointment all around with Slapstick Masters and all."
5,A true masterpiece,"I watched these shorts on Netflix and intend to order this DVD collection. All are very entertaining, but ""One Week"" is one of the funniest shorts I have ever seen. In an age prior to stunt men, prior to animation, and prior to CGI, this film is a major achievement.Apparently some of the reviewers here have so little sophistication as to be unable to discern musical genius. I expect that they cannot comprehend anything that doesn't adhere to the normalcy of pop music. I'm sure they are equally unable to appreciate Berloiz or Zappa.But The Alloy Orchestra is able to mold melody, style, disonnace and rhythm, and the universe of instrumental sounds to convey the story line, the emotion and the appropriate background sounds of these films simultaneously. I think these masterpieces all benefit markedly from the loving care applied to the modern soundtracks for these priceless films."
3,A good introduction to that time period,"A good selection of the top stars from the era of ""Slapstick"" and silent films.I found the clips themselves mildly amusing and my kids laughed out loud a few times but I can't imagine adding this sort of film to my collection. Historically, it has it's place. Entertainment wise, well there is a reason we developed ""talkies"" and ""color"".I would mention that I am baffled by those who complained about the music.The music accompaniment was well done and completely appropriate for this genre of film. I can only assume that those who complained had never before viewed a ""silent"" film from this time period."
1,"Wonderful films, ruined by the modern music","Music accompanying silent movies should not be annoying, and certainly shouldn't sound modern. The Alloy Orchestra completely ruins these great films with their cacophony. ""Big Business"" and ""One Week"" are absolute classics, but, in spite of an excellent visual experience, this DVD went straight to the second hand shop. I will wait until these films are presented with decent soundtracks before I add them to my film library."
5,I want Amerika on DVD,"This was an incredible miniseries and I absolutely can't see why it was only shown once, buried at the request of the then-emerging PC mobs. Yes, it was anti-communist, anti-Soviet and anti-totalitarian. Somehow, the communist, Soviet-loving totalitarians bullied ABC into erasing even the memory of this television even. I still remember my deep disappointment at the time after I learned that I would not be able to watch the couple of episodes I had missed because there weren't going to be any reruns.Dear ABC, please, please, please let us have another look at your work of 20 years ago. We will pay money for the pleasure so, what seems to be the problem?And, yes, the music was great but I want the visuals as well."
2,Shallow,"I found _How to Watch TV News_ to be very disappointing and shallow. After reading this book, I was left with the impression that ""if that's all that's wrong with television news, then there's nothing to worry about."" On the contrary -- television news programs combine the mass, mainstream media with the technology of television -- a very dangerous combination!The book doesn't discuss the inherent problems of the medium of television that make television news programs ineffectual. And the list of suggestions on ""how to watch TV news"" is obvious and uninspiring, and doesn't offer any profound methods for ""defending yourself"".Instead of this book, read _Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television_ by Jerry Mander, and _Manufacturing Consent_ by Herman and Chomsky. _Consent_ will open your eyes to the essential reality of how the mainstream media works, and _Four Arguments_ will give you many more than four reasons why you should turn off your television!"
3,This is a good book to skim in a library.,"I decided to buy Postman's book after reading a two page revelation that local news shows (the authors emphasize that they are ""shows"" not to be mistaken as public utilities) are cast to appear as a family. Dad is the main anchor and there is usually a ""mom."" The ""kids"" include a light-hearted weather person and a boyish-cute sports person. The show needs the audience to feel a sense of stability from this on-screen family to counter the chaos they describe in terms of news. Fascinating observation. I buy the book. Unfortunately, there are only five or six similar flourishes of insight amidst a sea of cynicism. And I agree with a previous reviewer's assessment of the authors' shallow prescription."
5,Great 1st book!!!!!,I think that Kimberly did a great job on this book. The pictures are beautiful. I have been waiting for a stylish 30 something to enter into this arena b/c frankly I am getting tired of the same old stuff. Kimberly gives some great new party and project ideas throughout the book. I think she has a bright future ahead.
4,If you're looking for a few great ideas,"I bought this book for its baby shower projects and not as an overall book on entertaining. Some of the tips on entertaining are a little overplayed and trite - like you need to find your ""true"" style and go with it. However, there are some great original projects that I haven't seen anywhere else so it was worth the money for me."
1,Ewwww....NOT GOOD AT ALL,"Who are these reviewers adoring this book? FRIENDS AND FAMILY? Funny how they don't have other reviews attached to their homes other than this book.Anyway, I'll give you an honest review of this book: It sucks. Yes, I think the photography is gorgeous, but this book has nothing original to say or add. It's like she woke up one day and was like, ""Oh, yeah...that's right...I have to figure out how to do a book.""zzzzzz"
1,Total waste of time; don't waste your money,"This book is horrible. They just threw some stuff out to get a book published and should be ashamed of themselves. So naturally I was curious when there were so many one stars yet so many 5 stars...as another reader identified, the ones with 5 stars are quite suspicious -- almost all have not reviewed a single other book and the one guy has read over 3,000, but all have five stars. How could that be, either his standards are very low or he has another agenda. Beware, don't waste your money!"
1,Burberry is very down market,I didn't really like the book I think she is trying to hard to be Martha Stewart.Most of her ideas I have seen before (also seen the ideas better presented).Also she is not very well informed if she was she would know that the Burberry check is now seen has very downmarket and anyone who wanted to appear stylish wouldn't go near it.Save your money and use it to buy a book by someone who knows what they are writing about.
3,School Counselor,"When I bought this book I was looking for more ideas about how to use art therapy in a school setting. The book gives you some ideas, but not as many as I hoped (about 4 per theme). I feel that the book isn`t that deep either. A good book for starters, but I don`t feel you can run art therapy sessions based on this book."
5,Great for those who are newly espoused......,"I bought this book at a Cracker Barrell store and couldn't wait to get home to try it out. The recipes are so easy, and they don't call for outlandish ingredients and spices that noone ever has! After only two weeks, I had prepared over ten recipes from the cookbook.I recently gave this as a gift to a young newlywed co-worker. Once I heard she was feeding her husband Hamburger Helper every night, I knew I had to give her this particular book to get her on her way to being the next great cook! With recipes only having 3-4 ingredients, it makes it easy to personalize the dishes by adding your own flavor...OR she could get her sweetie in the kitchen to help come up with their own masterpiece meals!!!This is my very favorite cookbook to share with my ""tween"" daughter, too! Nothing is too difficult for even an 11-12 year-old to handle! I love it!"
2,Not one of my favorites,"The story is silly, giddy and rather long-winded. There is no plot and some of the characters are either unreal or not very likable. If I read another book in this time period, it will be a mystery or suspence novel."
4,"Good, reminds me of why I loved Dune in the first place","This book has two major components the small portion that was actually written by Frank Herbert and the vast majority that was actually written by Frank and Brian. The earlier draft of the story has many cool similarities to the Dune that was eventually produced. The two that stand out the most for me are that the concept of the FREMEN is completely absent and the original version of the story focused more on the Noblemen father then the noblemen child. While I love the original dune I always felt that Duke Leto was disposed of in a rather convenient and half-baked manner.I also have to say that the short stories included ""Faces of the Martyrs"" and ""On Caladan Seas"" are world's better then any novel length book these two authors have ever produced.Overall-Not perfect but it is well worth the time."
3,Interesting but not necessary,"The Road to Dune is intended to give the reader an appreciation of the evolution of thought that resulted in the classic novel Dune by Frank Herbert. Only a small portion of the book actually addresses this, that namely being the letters back and forth between Herbert and the editor. The novel 'Spice Planet' is interesting as it is based on the original outline for Dune that Frank Herbert had created, but the story is only of middling quality. It would've been more meaningful to simply include the original outline then to try to create a new (and rather confusing) tale that falls very short of the final novel. The outtakes from Dune and Dune Messiah are interesting, if only to see what wound up getting pulled by the editor. The short stories again are interesting, but not all that great. I think this book is really intended for the hardcore fan, but even then I think it's only so-so and definitely not necessary to the readers appreciation of Dune and the Dune series."
4,book review,Interesting book to see the process of the creation of a masterpiece of a book such as Dune. Well written
4,Super Reader,"The introduction and excerpts from Dune and Dune Messiah werefascinating, as was the process of the first book actually beingpublished, but only serially to start with! Again, the youngergeneration's works I can take or leave. However, they do explain howthey were working from a ton of material that Frank left, and how theywent through it, scanned it so they could search it, etc. If you don'tlike any of the other 'new' sequels, this one is certainly worthchecking out.It also includes a 'proto' Dune novel, much shorter, that Herbert shelved and turned into his masterpiece.Certainly worth a look."
1,Kevin J Anderson shouldn't be let near the Dune series,"Kevin J Anderson is, at best, a mediocre pulp science fiction author. He is no where near the caliber of ideas and writing that Frank Herbert is and to let Anderson loose on Herbert's universe is devastating."
2,GARBAGE,"This books is 450 pages long.Only 150 pages of those 450 were written by Frank Herbert!!!If you are a Dune fan - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!! It is yet ANOTHER cash-grab assault against FH by his son & fellow hack Kevin J. Anderson. These idiots are HACKS.The first 200 pages or so are a 'novel' by BH & KJA based on an ""outline"" by FH, which later became Dune. Where is this ""outline""? Why wasn't IT published?? The last 1oo pages or so are crappy ""short stories"" by The Hacks which are available for FREE all over the internet!PLEASE: let's stop giving The Hacks money & motivation to go on raping Dune! They have a ""young Paul"" trilogy in the works and another ""novel"" based on an ""outline"" which was meant to be Dune 7. They've mined enough cash from FH's brilliant book!2 stars for the 150 pages by FH. The other trash subtracts 3 stars!!STOP THE HACKS!!!"
2,Belly shirt for babies,I bought this shirt because my family wanted to wear black shirts for our family portrait. Black shirts for babies are super hard to find. The shirt looked like it would work for a boy or a girl based on the picture. When the shirt arrived it had some gathering on the neckline. I felt this made it look girly. I didn't have time to order another shirt and I figured I would just make the best of it since he would only need to wear it this one time. The shirt was super short on him. He is an average size in both height and weight and is still wearing a size smaller than I ordered. I just think this shirt is made poorly.
5,Excellent source of information for the non-biostatician,"Comprehensive, succinct with relevant examples that make the teaching points clear to even a non-biostatician like myself.I have used this book in helping me to design clinical studies and it was extraordinarily useful! Thank you Dr Riffenburgh."
2,kind of o.k.,It is kind of o.k.very difficult to find some particular thingso many details and information which nobody needs
5,Hilarious! Couldn't put it down!,"This is probably the most hilarious book I have ever read! I laughed out loud numerous times while reading about Sarah and Moe's adventures in nursing school, as nurses, and finally, as midwives. As a L&D nurse (and future midwife!) I can relate to so many of these vignettes that Miss Urang has written. Very well-crafted, superb writing. Would love to see a sequel to this book!!"
1,Foul language abounds.,"I read a lot of books about birth and midwives. I was so looking forward to reading this book, but was extremely offended by the abundant foul language and crude descriptions of the author's sex life. The good, decent, informative parts of the book were so surrounded by the sewage that I could never recommend this book to anyone. My copy will go in the garbage."
2,definitely fiction,"Having gone to nursing school with Sally, I know how much ""poetic license"" went into writing this book. I prefer a lot more reality in my fiction. Where is the micteration station? Shouldn't Dolly be explaining the missionary position?"
4,Really Great Season!,"This is a great season of Reba lots of struggles, but lots of fun too. The Ghost and Mrs. Hart is a great episode. I would highly recommend this DVD set to any Reba fan!"
5,Reba,"Another great product with Reba. Excellant actors, I just love this show. Can't wait to complete my seasons."
3,REBA SEASON 3,"I am a big fan of Reba so the DVD's are perfect. However, instead of putting episodes on the back, having to turn over the cd to watch it, there should be more then one instead. As with season 4-5."
1,ANOTHER LAME ATTEMPT AT SLAPSTICK COMEDY....,"This program fails in all departments. Obviously McEntire has a huge fan base who will support her in anything she does, even mediocre junk like this. I agree with the poster below about the ""Happy Pills"" episode. It isn't right to make fun of people who take anti-depressants. And it isn't right for this program to poke fun at the dysfunctionalism of society either."
4,Great fun,Great way to spend an evening - clever lines and great acting!No weak links or players. Really good show
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOLKS!,"There is nothing new in this third season that hasn't been on the first or second. Just the same rehash, overplayed schtick that Reba thinks she does so well. In some episodes she does but in most she just makes everyone else look bad. She's a good singer of ""real country music"" (something she used to do a long time ago) but she is a lousy, stinkin' actress."
5,Go Reba (again!),"Excellent Excellent Excellent....!Have now purchased and watched Seasons 1 to 4, having got hooked on the show while on holiday.Great fun, perfect characters, believable issues, and funny funny funny. Barbara Jean and Van are favourites in this house. But when, oh when will Seasons 5 and 6 be available to buy?"
4,GREAT Season,"I started watching this show in its second season on The WB back in 2003, along with ""What I Like About you"", ""Sabrina"", and ""Greetings from Tuscon"". I continued watching REBA and WILAY, and I think that this is by far the show's best season. It had the funny storylines, and then the serious ones. I already own the first two seasons on DVD and hope to get the 3rd one for my birthday (May 28) or earlier! If you are going to buy ANY season on REBA on DVD, this would be the one to go for!"
