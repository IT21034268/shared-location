3,publi serects,I always enjoy Nora roberts Book I would say she is one of my favoutie writters this book was know different I could not put it down.
4,Public Secrets,"Good, fast pace read. Not academic but just a good way to pass time. I was happy that I did not figure ""who done it"" before very close to the end."
3,Bit slow,I didn't like this one as much as others I have read of Nora's. I found it a bit slow and not up to her usual standard.
2,"Public Secrets, not a good choice!",I am a Nora Roberts fan. I have read almost all of her books. I was very disappointed in this book. The language was just unacceptable for a typical Nora Roberts boo.
3,Public Secrets,"While I enjoyed this book, it was a bit predictable and slightly drawn out. The story line was definitely interesting."
4,Public Secrets,"It was a good book, but would enjoy it much better if it was less descriptive in the sexual part."
2,What happened to proof reading???,"I have never seen a book with so many typos in my entire life! What's up with this? Didn't anyone read it before it was published? Apparently not. At one point Michael is standing in his father's orifice (instead of office). Ouch! That sounds very uncomfortable. As for the story, it is very similar to River's End. Two generations. Fame and fortune. A murder that is unsolved for 20 years. I like Nora Roberts faster moving stories much better. These two were my least favorite of all her books."
3,Is There A Proofreader In The House? Anybody?,"This was the first book I purchased for the Kindle my kids gave me for Christmas, and if the typos in this one are any indication of the quality of a Kindle read it'll end up being one of those unused gifts that you keep sitting around just so nobody's feelings get hurt. Seriously, the errors are plentiful and run the entire gamut: punctuation, grammar... there are even a couple of instances where Latimer's name is spelled Larimer. Really??? Among the multitude, however, my favorite was when Latimer (or Larimer, take your choice) is standing in his father's orifice.Yes, his orifice.A page turner in typical Nora Roberts fashion, but the errors are unforgivable. 4 stars for the story, 1 star for the Kindle version. Atrocious."
2,Depressing and Boring,"I too was disgusted with all the typo errors in my Nook edition. As one other reviewer said, the main character, Emma, turned from an intelligent person, into an idiot. I kept thinking she was going to break out of that dysfunctional group she grew up with. It was like a documentary of the 60's and 70's and everything that could possibly go wrong in a family in that era did. These were sad sad people and I found the book overall depressing and boring."
4,i like the border after all.,"initially i wrote a terrible review for this wall border because it would not stick to the wall despite much effort.it says prepasted, which it isn't.i thought this might be the kind of wall border has an adhesive that you remove...no it's noti then thought this was the kind of wall border that you moisten and then it sticks....no it's noti bought wallpaper paste at the hardware store and thought that that would make it stick...no.i give up. i'm returning.after investigating, i should be giving the commercial wallpaper paste (zinnser) a negative review. I ended up making my own wallpaper paste after i found a recipe online. this recipe worked great....4 ingredients - flour, water, alum and oil of clove.the wallpaper looks great and my son is happy...so am i."
5,A Book to Treasure,"It's sort of amazing that these classics, almost 100 years old, are less expensive as used books than are new paperbacks. Good for you for finding this.I see this as a great present for a young reader. The Harvey version of Robin Hood is exciting, fast-paced, and very accessible. The tales are straightforward and the prose is direct and honest. So, as a work of fiction, this Robin Hood scores well.But further, the bookness of this edition is a major part of the present. This book - with its size, its heft, the illustrations and the elegant printing and the age - feels like a thing to treasure. It doesn't have to be babied, it should hold up to heavy use, but it is also should just feel special in a kid's hands. Can't guarantee that of course, but what a nice thought."
3,Not a good representation...,"Having seen Alabama live, I have to say this is not a very good representation of their live material. Alabama was an awesome band live, yet almost every live album I have is better than this one. This album isn't horrible or anything, it just does little to show what Alabama was like on stage."
2,just for show!,This handle broke in first 15 mins of use. This this is not for use. It is only for looks. They need to fix the rail clamps as they break very very easy...
1,Good Idea in Theory- Absolute Garbage is the Result,Horrible. This music doesn't even belong in an elevator. It's amazing that these songs are some of the best of the 20th century and have produced some great covers- This is not one of them. Potentially this could have been a good concept like Seu Jorge's Bowie album. I'd really like to stick a pair of dirty gym socks in this singers mouth as payback for ruining such great material.
4,Very Nice,"Great Tunes for a mellow Party, everyone enjoys it and it is so much cheaper than buying it on Itunes!"
5,Rolling Stones music with Latin beat,I love this CD - everyone who hears it asks me about it. Great latin beat variation to the songs.
1,Major disappointment,"This toy was way too advanced for my grandson. He is 5 and the toy was really not suitable for him. It required adult supervision, which was a buzz kill for him and he lost interest immediately. The label says ages 5-10, but I don't think 5 is old enough. He is all about immediate action and this toy is all about sitting and waiting for things to dry, etc."
4,Interesting...,I don't know what people are talking about in regards to mormism. This book is building block for what eventually became Dune.If taken in that context you can see how the world of Arrakis evolved.
2,Fizzles out...,"I'm in the process of trying to read all Frank Herbert just for the sake of it. This book starts off really strong. I liked the two main characters and some of their banter made me chuckle. But about 2/3 of the way through, he went off on some metaphysical mumbo jumbo tangent and completely ruined it for me. It's like he just left off what was a very interesting storyline and descended into some incomprehensible blather about our collective mind creating God, blah blah blah. I don't even know what the hell he was thinking given how the first 2/3 of the book read. Even the first 2/3 are not great fiction, but I did enjoy it. The last third of the book is a complete confusion of eastern metaphysical nonsense. When I read the ending, it left me shaking my head. My recommendation: the minute you get to the part where Orne arrives on Amel, just put it down and move on."
3,Too grand and atmospheric,"I am a huge Frank Herbert fan, and although I enjoyed the book, too much was left unexplained, both the 'technology' (?) and character motivations (what is psi, exactly???). The book seemed to jump from episode to episode, and unlike many of Herbert's better books, it focuses on a single character. While philosophically interesting, it does not provide the sense of adventure that Dune does. Thankfully the book is a quick read, or else it would require alot of imagination and a very long attention span. Recommended for diehard fans only."
2,"unremarkable, but a bit murky","I read this book about a year ago and filed it away in the category ""not-top-notch but-with-some-interesting-stuff"". Now that I take it down from the shelf I don't have the faintest what was interesting about it, but am sure I don't care to read it again. Looks murky, with ritual that smacks of the occult. Is this really SF? Not Herberts best work."
1,Hate on paper,"As an EX-Mormon, I can still say that this is one of the most misleading, hate-filled books on the market. It has often been used in various fundamentalists churches, whose believers are far less devoted to searching for the truth than are Mormons.It has also been frequently used (along with its film version) to stoke the fires of hate in areas where Mormons are erecting temples. If you think that anti-Mormon hate doesn't exist you need only look at the controversies surrounding the construction of Mormon temples around the country - Seattle, Denver, Dallas, Forest Hills, Tennessee, and, most recently, in Boston. The National Conference of Christian & Jews, The National Council of Churches, and many, many other interfaith associations, have denounced this book as dishonest and hateful. Even many career anti-LDS scholars have criticized it's truthless-ness."
4,Very enjoyable,"I just recently completed this one, even though it sat on my shelf for siz years after buying it. The individual episodes all seem to be fertile material for entire books. Instead, the reader is shown glimpses of fascinating alien worlds only to be whisked to the next scene. All in all, I found it very fun to read."
1,junk,"I forgot where I bought this, now I see. I was so ticked. Lasted about 6 months. Bellsouth phones have always been the best, maybe northweatern is not bellsouth."
1,Broke in two weeks!,"After less than three weeks, the touch-tone keypad quit working! Although under warranty, the cost and hassle to ship back led me to pitch it in the trash, and order a different brand!"
1,Low price and not worth the money,"I have to give it 0 stars. It worked for two weeks and then the speakerphone button would not always work. Then I started to get complaints from people trying to call me that they were always getting a busy signal when they tried to call me. A lot of the time when I would pick up the receiver there was no dial tone, so the problem seemed to be that the receiver was not hanging up the phone."
4,Simple Statistics,"If you are looking for a statistics book that explains things in a simple and elementary way, this book is for you! Additionally, the problems are straightforward. However, it requires that you know calculus I for some of the problems. It also has computer applications that you can practice. The only drawback is that the probability chapter is skimpy. You may want to supplement your knowledge of probability with another book, since statistics requires that you know probability first."
3,Good book without the unnecessary confusion added,"The author adds unnecessary confusion by ignoring variable naming conventions. In some places he uses ""y"" as the independent variable name, while in other places, he uses ""x"". I have never seen f(y) on the vertical axes but yet the author uses P(y) on the vertical axes. It seems the only equation he got correct, according to convention, was the historical y=mx+b. This book should be dreastically updated to conform to standard variable naming conventions. After eliminating the variable naming confusion, I think this book will be an excellent book to read and learn"
4,The sax player is so hot!,"The sax player on this album, Mary Fettig is so hot! It's too bad that she was not heard from again. I particularly like the rendition of Green Dolphin Street on this album.I gave this 4 stars only because the tracks with Mary Fettig on them make the other songs a little less sparkling.This is one of my all-time favorite albums by my favorite jazz pianist."
1,Not a good read,I just could not get into this novel. Maybe I quit too early but I just didn't like it at all.
2,Not sure yet,I been taking them on and off for about a month. I don't see any difference. Perhaps because I do not take them consistently?
5,Yoko Ono - Everyman Everywoman,"It's amazing that Yoko Ono is now #1 on the dance charts. This record was originally recorded at the Hit Factory in NYC in 1980, during the recording of John & Yoko's ""Double Fantasy"" LP...24 years ago!John Lennon always knew that his wife Yoko was ahead of her time. He was right all along! Her time has come! Yoko is toppermost of the poppermost."
5,solid as a rock,Great hole punch vs others in its style and price this is the one you should buy. The next most affordable one $10 more and significantly less useful.
5,works Great.,Works great. Handles a lot of pages at once. Adjustable hole spacing. Very heavy duty. I can recommend buying it.
5,Unbeatable Quality,You wont get a better 3 hole punch.. just buy it..agree with all the other reviewers :) deserves 5 star
5,super good,"The punch is very very good. it really surprises me. super good, all in all. Cut the paper nicely and easy to use."
1,Poor Quality,"After just one week of use, an essential part of the hole puncher broke in half (!!!) making it unusable. I had not been overly filling the puncher but for some reason it could not bear the use of 20-30 sheets at a time. Would not recommend to others."
5,It punches holes,"You would think that hole punches are not exactly rocket surgery as far as product design and quality control goes, but you'd be wrong. I've seen many that were misdesigned or sloppily manufactured. Not this one. To prevent the common problems of paper getting stuck underneath the guide bushings instead of in the slits, the portion of the sheet metal base that the guide bushings are mounted on is recessed! All the sheet metal parts are a heavy gauge, so the whole thing doesn't move around as you try to operate it. The bracket for selecting paper size does not have much play in it.This thing punches holes. In the right place. The first time. And won't break any time soon. Awesome."
5,can cut staples.... o.O,"This thing punched through part of a staple when I was punching a stapled stack of about 20 pages of regular copy paper. I'd say that's heavy-duty! (See photos.)I'm not sure I'd say it works like a hot knife through butter, but it definitely punches through tough things more easily than other 3-hole punches I've used. It seems to go about halfway through a large stack (so ~10 pages) easily, and then I have to apply a little more force to get the rest of the way through. It's NOT enough force that the metal hurts my hand though.As an added bonus, the holes were already at a good distance from one another straight out of the box. I did have to adjust the page size to 11"" since I was punching 8.5 x 11 paper, but that was very simple to do."
5,Great little item,"This cuts paper like it is ""butter."" I am less concerned with the number of sheets that it can handle, than how well it performs on a reasonable number, say 10-15 sheets. No problems at all. The only thing one needs to do is make sure you are setting the adjustment for the size paper you are punching--if you don't the holes will be in the wrong spot and may be off-center or outside the edges of your binder, if you are using one. I looked at the electronic punchers and would recommend this instead unless you are unable to apply any pressure with your hand. This product is likely to outlast most of us."
5,Great product,Had my last punch for 20 years. This one is so much better I wish i had replaced the old one before it broke.
5,Sparco - Heavy Duty is Exactly That!,"I debated on different makes and models then chose this one thinking it would do the job. Well - I'm impressed - this is a very solid well made product that appears as though it will stand up to it's purpose for years to come. Cuts holes cleanly, no pounding to get it through several sheets - it justs cuts like a hot knife through warm butter - very pleased.I recommend this make and model - you will like it. Steve"
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"For what I paid for this product, I have been pleasantly surprised. I was worried it would break immediately, given that comparable products were selling for at least four or five times as much. But it has worked really well for me (but I have only owned it for a few months). I would say I usually punch about 30 pages at a time. For that, it is a great product at a great price."
5,Excellent product for the price,"Purchased this as a replacement for a similar product that had broken return springs for the punches. This is stamped metal rather than cast, however, it functions very well - is very easy to adjust and use. It was half the price of the previous punch and should last at least as long. Excellent product for the price."
5,Love This 3-Hole Punch!,"After struggling for quite some time with a 3-hole punch that wouldn't work and ended up having no bottom to catch the shards, I gave in and purchased this punch. I absolutely love how strong it is, the increased number of pages I can punch at a time, and how easy it is to press down because of the wider top.Everything that was wrong with the previous punch is now right with this one. It probably sounds kind of weird to be this excited about a three-hole punch, but in my line of work I download and print a lot of material to keep in various three-ring binders. Therefore, I need something strong and easy to use that I can keep near my desk. This is the one!"
5,Great,Overall I think I would give it a 9.5 out of a possible 10. I wish the settings were marked better. That is my only gripe. Excellent price though.
4,nice size for the amount of $,I like that I paid $20 for a pretty durable heavy duty hole puncher that if I used my $20 in Staples - I would get one of those 3 page hole punchers instead. Perfect for scholars and for myself at work.
5,Facets is a Great Album,"Monty Alexander is the essence of the perfect pianist. He is a joy to listen to. Facets is quite literally, a great album. Monty and Ray Brown are wonderful together."
1,Avoid this book,"This is a depressing book for people trying to find resilience within themselves. Dr. Flach blames parenting, childrood, peer groups and ""the unconscious"" - all of which one cannot change. He seems to believe in psychotherapy not self-help, which is disappointing. What a downer."
4,Lace me up!,"This was written in the style of a ""diary,"" but was far more readable than the Bridget Jones series. This is probably because the Jones series was written with a lot of abbreviations and shorthand, whereas this book was written in a first-person narrative style. It was well written and humorous, and while I did really like the main character, there were some character features that I just didn't think... gelled. Case in point: she's very self-conscious about her weight, and yet, in bed she's a really wild woman. I just couldn't really see that, I guess. But the story was lively and entertaining, and I kept reading - in one sitting - so I'd recommend it to anyone who likes romance and wouldn't be offended by a little gratuitous... you know."
4,Laugh out loud funny...,"This was the first Katie MacAlister novel I picked up, and I fell in love with her then and there. There were definately areas that could have been better, but it was all in all wonderful. The situations her characters get into remind me of some of the horrible, yet hilarious, situations I myself have found myself.As soon as I finished I made sure to get a copy to my best friend - the true mark of a good book!"
2,COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK. THE HEROINE IS AWESOME BUT THERE WAS NO PLOT. I LIKED THE FACT THAT THE HEROINE IS NOT A TWIGGIE WANNABE AND IS AN ACTUAL PERSON WHO SCREWS UP, BUT AFTER YOU GET OVER THE FIRST FEW STUPID MOVES SHE MAKES, THAT IS THAT. NOTHING NEW."
5,Laugh till yours sides ache funny,"I love Katie McCalister I first Read ""A GirlFriends Guide to Vampires"" And I never thought I would laugh that hard again, untill I read the next book of hers I found and just bought a personal copy of ""Corset Diaries"" I love how Katie writes and has the herione as ""bigger women"" and thats fab! and I love how she always manages to make these woman seem like friends that you know. Or things you would never do yourself She is just a awesome writer. Her books just suck you in and you (at least I cant) put it down till I am done with it. I am sure that you will find that Ms. McCalister will soon become one of your favorite authors as well!"
4,Exceptional Service from Amazon,"10-4 Monday: I thought I had reviewed this, the service as usual wasexceptional. The book arrived in timely fashion and in good condition.As always a pleasure to do business with you and your suppliers.BSwavely"
1,Could have been waaaaay better,"Dull, flat and frequently crass. It's a harsh description of any book, but that's what I have to give this one. I've done historic recreation, so picked up this book hoping to read an entertaining romantic comedy because I know how funny these situations can get sometimes.What I found was full of cliches and sophmoric jokes concerning bodily functions, with snide remarks between the hero and heroine that passed as wit. I kept asking myself why she was interested in this guy. Then I found myself asking why she slept/was continuing to sleep with this guy if he was such a jerk. The ending is abrupt and somewhat contrived and I found no real indication that the couple had grown or made a commitment to one another.It's sad because I really wanted to like this book and ended up feeling like I was about to throw it against the wall. Friends have told that some of her earlier works are better, but there wasn't enough here to convince me to try."
1,Size does matter?,"Love, love, LOVE Katie Macalister's books but NOT this one! Just couldn't like the heroine...and couldn't understand the attraction between her the the hero, Max. She's a size 18, five years older than him, throws up on this shoes at their first meeting, breaks wind in front of him at the next, babbles unintelligently, meddles in his relationship with his daughter, and yet....he falls madly in love with her. I really like the fact that Ms. Macalister writes about women who are less than perfect, but this one was just too irritating for words! Couldn't finish the book. Hope the next book is back up to Ms. Macalister's usual standards."
4,It was a great book.,"The Corset Diaries is a great book. I would recommend this book it is about a love that everyone thought was not meant to be. Tessa is a vaguely large woman, who does not believe in herself and has no courage, while Max is a muscular, sensitive man. Anyone with eyes can see that they are not made for each other, but their hearts tell them that they are. Also, the theme of the story is to always have faith even when all your hope is gone. We learn this when Max and Tessa stay together through all the drama, and finally decide to marry. Throughout the book there is tension and suspense between characters and events taking place. For example, when everything starts to go wrong at the grand ball: flying salmon, people screaming, and a saboteur is loose, we assume that the ball is going to remain disastrous, but everything slowly resolves. My reasons for recommending this book surpass the reasons for not recommending the book. Overall, I would recommend this book to other people."
3,Not one of her best...,"I thought the story line in the Corset Diaries was really great, very original. And to be fair, the comedy was there. I laughed out-loud several times. But I've found with Katie Macalister's books that some sizzle and some fizzle. I thought this one was more of a fizzle. The journal-style of writing was unnecessarily confusing. She kept skipping through time, which made the crescendo of the relationship muddled for me.I'll admit I'm not a big fan of first person romances - I like to get in both main character's heads. Only hearing Tessa's side of the story, I didn't find the romance believable. We were never given a good reason for Max to fall in love. Tessa just didn't do it for me...sorry Katie. I'm a big fan!"
3,Romance novel posing as chick lit,"I thought this would be witty, clever chick lit, but it was a just a typical romance novel with a predictable, time-worn plot. (Chubby American poses as wife to rugged Brit for a TV show, and they fall in love, meet with obstacles, but have a happy ending.) Just okay, not particularly good."
3,You'll laugh along with the *gasp* plus size heroine!,"Hugely funny romance novel. I laughed out loud at several parts. Only the second book I've read of this genre where a) the heroine is NOT skinny, and b) she is funny and neurotic and strange and has hang-ups and... in other words, she's perfectly normal. If you like this book, I recommend Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series."
2,What's the Point?,"There are two very good reasons not to bother with this CD:1. The outstanding performances of Handel's Italian (Arcadian, pastoral, etc.) cantatas by the ensemble La Risonanza, currently being released and up to volume 4, which obviate the need for a CD of excerpted duets.2. The singing, which ranges from okay to hideous. Emmanuelle Haim seems to be on her own voyage of discovery, or rather rediscovery, of how to sing Baroque music in the ""Can Bellow"" style of the 1950s! Some of the singers on this CD simply shouldn't venture earlier than Donizetti. Some of them - in fact the majority - should know better than to cooperate with such nonsense - wide and constant vibratos, forced tempi, strained voices, ham-handed keyboard accompaniment. Haim is a total mystery, unless we assume some special affliction of musical bi-polarity."
2,Not a good choice,"If you are not a great fan of Haendel, pass! It's interesting but not the best 'job' of Haim..."
2,Tattoos and Sports,"I was'nt that impressed with this book.I thought it was going to go into alot more detail and show better array of pictures.Most of the pictures you can see on the internet already.The pictures that new were very few and far in between.It is a nice book to add to a collection,if you like tattoos or sports.Not a hreat book to learn about the players tattoos and meanings or even to see pctures of them.Some pictures shown didnt even get explained in the book."
1,What a joke!,NBA players have no respect for the art of tattooing or the history of it-- they simply get tattoos to look tough and/or get attention. This book is about as superficial as the tattoos it portrays.
3,nice but not illustrated well,"Book seems nice, but there are only about 6 illustrations per flower. In my opinion not enough to go by. i am more of a see it and do it type then a read it and do it type so if you are like me I suggest finding a different book. these flowers look like silk or paper when done, so it is nice, but I have only been able to create two of the flowers so far with success."
3,Nice Book!,"I bought this book to learn more about creating sugar flowers. I didn't find it to be very helpful. I think it needs a few more illustrative pictures. If you're a experienced cake decorator, this may be simple enough for you, but beginners might want to pass on this one and find a book that begins with more simple designs that work up to the more detailed flowers. I had difficulty keeping my flowers from cracking and breaking when I rolled them out as thin as they're illustrated in the book."
2,Just For The Record,I wanted to see more old video footage of Spike and Co performing. Behind the scenes details of his percussion pieces and props would have been of interest to me.Best to just listen to his legacy of great recordings and let your imagination run wild. No pictures needed.BE
4,Overlooked Brit-Pop Band ! Excellent Cd !!!,"Howdy !Buy this cd now !!!Terribly overlooked and out of step with the American grunge scenethat was going on- this is a throw back to the 60's- great catchy songs.Perhaps with the recent release of the Rhino Brit-Pop compilationmusic lovers will look into some of the more obscure bands from that era andthis cd is a great start. Well done cd with several highlightsincluding: the Rhino Box set inclusion ""(Don't Cut Me Down) Mary Quant In Blue"", andseveral other strong hit single types: She Drops Bombs (sounds like the Beatles from Revolver),Planet Love, Godlike, Sad Rush On Sunday and No Coming Down.An excellent all around effort, they released a second cd but this is where its at.Don't walk, Run to get this !Cousin Bobby"
2,Soft but poorly constructed,"When I first got the cases I thought it was a deal for the price, but after just one wash three of the four lost the seams on the side opposite the opening. Also they are reversible but the stitching is all exposed when the satin side is out, this seems backwards to me. Overall the quality of construction is quite bad and thus two stars. In my opinion the only redeeming factor is the price."
1,Shoddy workmanship,The seems on these are lumpy and crooked. The stitches are crooked and coming unraveled. There is a large white tag sticking out of the supposedly reversible black pillowcase. Can't be removed without extensive unpicking and resewing.
3,Stamina,"The exercises and the machine are great but the instructor doesn give adequate instructions before hand so I find myself constantly having to pause, fastforward and/or rewind. It's annoying. But the work out is great, I can see and feel a difference after a few weeks."
5,No rebounder needed,Took me a long time to find this DVD. It does not use the rebounder at all on this DVD. It is true it does not start you from basics so it is good to get level 1 first. Level 1 gives basic instructions so that when you get to level 2 you are already very familiar with the moves & process. Level 2 gives you more of a workout & is more challenging. It's good to watch it all the way through first before attempting to do the workout. She goes a little fast so sometimes you will have to pause the player while you finish your repetitions. Get this - you will have great success.
4,Good,"I really didn't know what to expect, other than more challenging than level 1.While there are some new exercises and modifications to others, I was disappointed in some of the explanations. I found I was watching some of the exercises more than once, and am not sure I ever got them right.That being said, I am pleased enough with the purchase to give it 4* and will use it. Although, I anticipate I will be purchasing level 3 sooner rather than later."
2,Not Better,I think the Stamina Level 1 is better then Stamina Level 2. Disapointed. The reason I bought Level 2 was because about 6 years ago I had another Performer and sold it with all the videos and the Level 2 then was much different. They changed it.
1,Not great,"I have a beginners set of dvd from this same company and thought I would move on from there. I got this and hated it. I found she was even more confusing with her directions than ever, but figured it would take a few tries and all would be good. Not me. In the beginning she forgets to tell you how many cords to start with, and in the middle I just could not figure out what I was supposed to be doing or when. I found I was dreading doing Pilates so after almost a month of torture, I returned it."
5,What's in it,"I read so much about the anthology, but nowhere did I find what plays were actually presented, for those interested here is the list: Orestia, Agamemnon, Liberation Bearers, Eumenides, Oedipos King, Medea, Lysistrata, Matsukaze, Chushingura, Second Shepards' Pageant, Everyman, Doctor Faustus, Hamlet, The Tempest, Life is a Dream, Tartuffe, Phaedra, The Rover, Loa DIvine Narcissusm Recruiting Officer, Doll House, Father, Cherry Orchard, Major Barbara, Six Characters..., Mother Courage, Endgame, Homecoming, Hamletmachine, Cloud Nine, Our Country's Good, Trifles, Hairy Ape, Glass Menagerie, Dutchman, Vedidos, True West, Fences, M Butterfly, Angels in America I, Fires in the Mirror, America Play, Lady Aoi, My Beatles, A Tempest, Information for Foreigners, Death and King's Horseman, Translations, Gangsters, No Sugar, Dry Lips Oghta..., Valley Song. On top of it all, there are incredible and insightful critical reviews."
2,Missing pages,"I ordered this textbook and it came in good condition, until I realized it has 70 missing pages. It hops from page 560 to 609, right in the middle of Beckett's ""Endgame""! Too bad, it's a great book."
4,SO MANY PLAYS,"A great number of plays, however the fact that they are all crammed into one book makes it very hard to transport. Also the dictionary thin pages are easily ripped if one is not careful. Other than that it is probably required for your college class so you could care less what the reviews say."
3,Good overview of the threats of computer crime,"Cybercrime - Vandalizing the Information Society is a good book that gives the reader a competent synopsis of why computer crime exists.Furnell's main point, that computer security is still not resilient enough to deal with the current threats should be taken to heart.The book is light on the FUD factor (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) and heavy on case histories and statistics. This is turn makes this a good title for the non-technical audience.Overall, Cybercrime Vandalizing the Information Society is a very readable book with a lot of good information."
5,I found this book to be so helpful!,"Just got my copy, and I have been going to all the sites that JohnnyJet recommends. Never could have found about 70% of these web sites without having this book!"
4,"Real, authentic life stories from a true Latino writer.",Rudolfo Anaya has a remarkable way of telling a stroy from the eyes of person that grew up in the southwest. Rudolfo's descriptions of the life and strugles of his characters always make reminds me of my child hoood while growing up in that culture. His books tell it like it is or was and the Heart of Aztlan is no exception. It is a plesure to read a book from an author who takes his characters from real life experiences. If you want to see life through a Hispanic growing up in the southwest read Heart of Aztlan.
5,Response to a reader,"Itd be nice to read a Chicano writer that can actually write? Rudolfo Anaya is credited by many as actually being the founder of Chicano writing. Idiot (a reader). As I read his literature, I feel as if Ive been exposed to a whole world and culture I would otherwise be almost oblivious to. No doubt, there is magic in this man's writings."
1,Heart of Aztlan,"This novel lacks the type of depth that subsequently was attached to its release way back when. It is by far, not by any means, nothing more than a pulp effort, by an author with little true writer's skill. In short, I have never understood the hype. The novel, has been edited to the point that it reads like a borish child's book. Yet it is still around for all to read. With so much better efforts of its kind, one must wonder why this one stuck. It would have been nice to have a noted Chicano writer who can actually write. But instead we have this................"
5,Enlightening and Thought Provoking,"This book changed the way I could understand what was going on in America -- why certain places were becoming so busy and crowded and why others (especially suburbs and to some extent cities) were losing their appeal. The whole role of new priorities in America such as health and exercise, as well as the role of our technological revolution in reshaping the map of the continent, as described by Wolf, is enlightening and thought provoking. Not only that, he offers sound advice about how to make the communities under siege survive in a sustainable way as disireable communities way into the future. A must read!"
4,"Great sketches of some of the country's ""hot towns""","I picked up Peter Wolf's Hot Towns at a planning symposium because I liked the cover. Well, in Wolf's case, it wasn't only the cover that sold me. He reveals some tried and true Hot Towns - Aspen, CO - and some that were surprising to me. I guess the Myrtle Beach of my childhood has really picked up! This is a great read for anyone looking for a review of cities. They will find some they hate and some they will want to move to! This choice, however, is what makes America great. Hooray for Wolf!"
1,Poke my eye out!,"Please... this book reads like a bunch of random statistics thrown in with some verbiage. I did not find it compelling at all, perhaps because it would require memorization of a bunch of obscure factoids. Save your self the pain and agony, skip this book! I dutifully read every page on the hope I would find some tidbit useful or in case the plot would suddenly twist and improve. That did not happen."
5,Life beyond Hollywood,"In this illuminating autobiography, Myrna Loy shares her exhilirating life in a page-turner of rare sophistication. From her early desire to dance, through her struggle to get ""through the gates"" of the MGM lot, her almost slave-like work at MGM, her transformation into the ""perfect wife"", and her endless humanitarian work (most notably for UNESCO), Myrna Loy's life was more complex and substantial than that of ""just a Hollywood starlet."" A fascinating read about an extraordinary woman!"
3,Got too much into politics,"I like to read biographies like this to get a feel for the person, who they were, and how their life was behind the scenes. I did get that here, and I very much enjoyed the book at first. But the further along I got, the more it almost chiefly talked about her political activities. I understand now that this was apparently a big part of her life, and that's why it was in the book. I just wasn't expecting it. I do not like politics, so lost interest when it didn't seem to move to any other topic midway through the book :("
5,best bon jovi album not recorded by bon jovi,the review below this is spot on. great songs! great aor/arena rock!i just want to add that if bon jovi or survivor or boston used any of these songs on an album the song(s) would be number one hits.i will warn you away from the second release unless you really want to hear mitch sing but not rock. just found out about third album. sounds like he is rocking again.
5,"A fairy tale, not a fantasy","I suspect that most people today were not raised on fairy tales, as I was. Otherwise, they would have immediately recognized Glory Road for what it is--a fairy tale that goes on beyond ""and they lived happily ever after"" to explore what happens when the brave hero no longer has monsters to fight, and therefore has no useful function. This makes the last part of the book, which some readers found dull and extraneous, really the key part of the book. As for Heinlein interjecting his political philosophy--well, that's just late Heinlein.."
4,Excellent Heinlein Fantasy,"Glory Road is a stunning work of fantasy, although it is imbued with a science fiction world-building essence. This book tells the story of a man coming to grasp with the fact that he is a hero.What makes this story refreshingly different is Heinlein's distinct view of life. Most fantasy books interpret a different world, but keep the same moral structure. This book doesn't. It allows that people from different worlds are going to view ethical codes is different way.Also despite many of these reviewers, the ending is perfectly in tune with the rest of the novel. Without giving anything away, the ending is both original and realistic, creating good closure.This is neither Tolkien or Heinlein's normal work, but it is worth reading by any serious science fiction or fantasy fans."
5,A great example of classic Heinlein,Stories like this one exemplify Heinlein's ability to grab you and lead you through his weird and wonderful worlds with his well-paced prose. Here we get to follow the exploits of one of his alter-egos (complete with sword) as he winds his way through a strange but heroic adventure. This is a great book
2,Mix of Fantasy and Sci-fi,"'Glory Road' is Robert Heinlein's take on Fantasy. Being Heinlein, the fantasy elements have scientific explanations, but are fantasy nonetheless. In 'Glory Road' Heinlein is commenting on heroes and fantasy conventions, as well as adding commentary on social and political mores of late '50s early 60's America in the usual Heinlein manner.I have enjoyed several of Heinlein's works but I did not care for this one too much. I found the dialogue to be excruciatingly bad, and the plot to have absolutely no tension or drama. Even the usual pontificating, which normally doesn't bother me too much, just grated, even when I agreed. I guess I can see what Heinlein was doing here but I didn't enjoy the result."
4,"Great, but i dont like the ending","This book was one of the best science fiction books i have read.. It delves into matters i have not read of before, such as what does the hero do after the quest is over? And in spite of all the good things i wished the ending would of been different.. I am saying if i was in that situation i doubt i would do the same thing.. i wouldn't of left.. but i like books that make you think.."
4,A good time is had by all,"Not a masterpiece, but a thoroughly fun read. One of those fun books to find when you want to read something light but entertaining."
4,Good But,"I found this book to be a fairly good read, but the major flaw in my opinion was the unreality that the female was depicted. Way to much devotion to husband."
2,Poot,This Book bored the ever living poop out of me! I enjoyed the beginning then it just fell right of the cake! I give it 1 star cause i finished it. And a 2nd star for being sexyist!
2,No Real Ending,"After reading this, I didn't have the 'warm and fussy' feeling. The ending is somewhat weak, and beware not to read the back of your book (depending on which print you have), mine had a spoiler on it.I love Heinlein's book, but wish he had choosen another ending."
2,Saw it coming,"I had only experienced Heinlein through ""Stranger in a strange land"" but I had high hopes of this fantasy as i enjoyed ""Stranger"" and am usually able to get into fantasy books. I cant get through it. I hear that ""Stranger"" had really slow parts but i wasnt really shaken by them. This books faults are more on the massive string of action cliches level. I am no experienced sci-fi reader so maybe this is above average but just isnt my type o novel. Probably good beach reading, it seems to be an adventure written like a laid back day of lying in mud. Take this with a grain of salt, maybe the book gears up from where I am, halfway through... I'll update if I can get back into it."
2,Heavy-handed Heinlein,"The first two thirds of this book is a rollicking adventure story. It is well written and a lot of fun.However, Heinlein is extremely heavy-handed with the sex. I first read this book in my teens, and the sex scenes resonated very well with my adolescent sexual fantasies.Worse, I found the last third of Glory Road to be essentially unreadable. After the quest is completed, Heinlein gets up on his soap box, and starts preaching a Libertarian political/philosphical gospel. If -- as I am -- you are unsympathetic to this view, you will find this section of the book to be extremely annoying."
1,If you liked Farnham's Freehold...,"The very first portion of this book (a few pages) reads like the Heinlein who was head and shoulders above all other science fiction writers. Then it disintegrates into mush. This book is closer to Farnham's Freehold than it is to Waldo.At some point in his career, something happened to Heinlein's mind that altered the character and quality of his writing. Exactly when this happened is difficult to say, but this may have been the book in which it became undeniable. Glory Road could conceivably be used to mark the beginning of Heinlein's descent into madness."
3,Worth Reading,"Still original (to me) for its age and a good easy read, until the last 5 chapters, when it changes from a fantasy to marriage guidance, taxes and tips on horse betting (at least I learnt what a sweepstake is).He didn't need to stop at chapter 18, but could have jumped straight to the part where the married couple split and go their own way, without going into detail about why the marriage fell apart.Les."
5,Spielberg Should Read This!,"I wish someone like Steven Spielberg would make this into a movie, because with today's cinematography magic, I would finally be able to see that box!I first read this book 25+ years ago... I reread it periodically even now, as I think ""The Master"" just had fun with this one. This is one you read for the joy of fantasy... not for Henlein's usual socio-commentary or black science. After all, who wouldn't want to have Scar Gordon's adventures with the Empress of the Universes?"
3,Good book,"This wa a good book but, not one of my favorate Heinlein books. I tried it on a whim and the reviews."
4,"Not quite SF, not quite fantasy ... satire?","Glory Road is an enjoyable read. it is billed as Heinlein's only fantasy novel, but I find it hard to really bucket this story in that way. It is somewhat like a fantasy, but also has a similar character to Stranger or the Lazarus Long stories. Certainly it is not hard SF. I could argue this is actual a satire on fantasy novels.No matter - it is a good story, really two stories. The second half, after the hero succeeds in his quest, is really a separate story. This one is more thought provoking, asking what does a hero do when there is no quest to be fulfilled. I found this part somewhat unsatisfying, but still worth reading."
5,Oldy but a goody,"I think I read Glory Road when it first came out in the 1960s. I fell in love with Heinlein novels and would run home just so I could escape into his world. While I thought that a couple of his books were 'stinkers', this one is not. Probably one of his best."
5,Read so many times almost know the words!,"Robert Heinlein is one of my favorite authors. I have read Glory Road at least 10 times over the years. While I may know what is coming, I love the trip."
5,Another masteroiece by the master,"I listened to this on my ride back to Utah from ND and I could not have enjoyed it more.This was more in the lines of epic fantasy in one volume than the sci-fi you may have come to think, when you think RAH. But it does not suffer as a result.I thought the story was fun and kept moving - maybe the ending went on a bit, I ""got it"" long before it was hammered home, I can see how some might not have, so RAH let it go on a bit to be sure that most did.Still this is WELL worth the read. I would even suggest this for fans of other fantasy authors.David Eddings, Tolkien, Terry Brooks, etc... This had that kind of feel, but was conceived in the 1950's."
3,Looks nice but not ideal,"This is a decent looking alternative to the old plastic knob bathtub faucet but if you can redo your plumbing to get something that functions better, do it. The handle doesn't stay put. You can turn on the water and easily adjustment the temperature but the handle isn't 'solid'. There's a lot of 'play' in it. In addition, the washer in the faucet doesn't open up the flow entirely. Instead, water sprays out the way it would from a hose if you put your thumb over it."
3,Good Starter for Makeup Newbies,"This was the first makeup book I ever bought. I think it was great and I've read and reread it many times. This is the perfect book if you don't know anything about makeup and would like to learn. They break stuff down really simply into lots of step by step projects. It touches on many areas of makeup and has some great profiles of professional makeup artists. I do wish there was more info about the business and work part of being a pro, but the makeup is covered and explained nicely.When you're done, you'll have everything you need to begin step one in your makeup artist career. Honestly, I just finished a great book that is the one you want if you are ready to begin or add to a professional career in makeup. It'sThe Makeup Artist Handbook: Techniques for Film, Television, Photography, and Theatre. This is the book you want when you're ready to get serious!"
4,Good for learning the basics,"The book covers the basic principals of makeup, both staight and character makeup. I especially liked the activities (hands-on practice) that accompanied the chapters. These were things that were not touched on in cosmetology school. The book also contains student profiles, examples of their work and how they got started. The book is a good reference for anyone beginning a career, but would probably be to general for an accomplished, working artist."
4,"The Complete Make-Up Artist: Working in Film, Television and Theatre",My granddaughter was doing a research project on make-up and looking for tips on how to use make-up. This book was somewhat helpful.
4,Informative,"This is a good book, especially if you are a family member and want to know the PJ's perspective. As a mom of a pararescueman in training, I was enlightened by this point of view and the support system the families developed to sustain each other during emergencies. I enjoyed this book, read it from cover to cover as soon as it arrived. I have loaned it to several other family members who are also interested in knowing what our son may be called upon to do."
5,Great!,"this book is worth the money. but i have to admit, you have to have some interest in the Air Force, particularly the special tactics teams. all in all this book is very good."
3,Great hero!,"Brehm and his colleagues train hard and perform extraordinary, dangerous rescues. They should be commended for their selfless work and are obviously heroes. That Others May Live is an account of Brehm's life during a few notable rescues. The chapter on the Mount McKinley adventure is well written and exciting. There are plenty of insights into Brehm's inner thoughts and emotions as a rescuer, as a husband and as a family man.However, having read many excellent first person military accounts, I am disappointed in this book. It could have been so much more. Perhaps something got lost in the audio version. If you are looking for gripping, detailed and action packed adventures, I would suggest that you read the excellent books by Andy McNab, Cameron Spence, Chris Ryan and Mike Curtis."
1,Not worth the time,This book is less about PJ's and more about Brehm's personal ambitions and endless nights at the Matchbox. Do you really think more vulgarity makes the book better?
2,"Too personal, not enough professional","I respect what the PJs do.My father is a retired USAF SMSgt himself. During his service, he spent a couple of years with the 1722 Combat Control Squadron in McChord AFB, Washington. Coincidentally, I myself graduated from Niceville High School that was mentioned briefly near the end of the book.I just did not get what I was looking for out of this book. There was too much family talk and not enough talk about the action. I got the impression that Jack Brehm served during a time and in an area where not that much happened, considering the length of his service. It made for rather boring read, but since I just borrowed the book from the library, I'm not out any money, only time.Two other things bothered me about this book. I do not think one has to be a hard drinker to be a hard fighter and the gripes about military personnel not being paid enough are tiresome."
2,"Not enough daring rescue, too much of the author's life","I thought this was going to be a description of the excitement of the air force rescue group. There is some of this, but there is an awful lot of the life and times of Jack Brehm. I didn't find what he had for breakfast or who he went to the local bar with very interesting or exciting."
3,General Story,"This book was more a story than a documentary. If you want read about PJ's and what they do, consider looking elsewhere. This author dramatizes the account rather than writing objectively.Additionally, the editing of this book was poor. I found numerous grammatical errors and spelling mistaks."
2,"Authentic, but boring","Mr. Brehm has an impressive background and has certainly qualified himself as one of the ""best of the best,"" but this does not save the book from being just plain boring. I gave up about 3/4 of the way through the book. In addition, this book tends to promulgate the idea that people in high-risk, high-stress jobs must also ""play hard"" by frequenting bars, flirting, and engaging in irresponsible personal behavior. I know for a fact that this is not the case and I hate to see this seamier side of military service glamorized."
3,Takes Me Back,"So glad this CD was finally issued. ""Working up a sweat"" is my song! I also love ""Miracle Worker"". This album takes me back to the good ole days."
3,Part non-fiction / part fiction,A book about Arkansas Ozark architecture would probably be incredibly boring to anyone but an architectural historian. So the author has chosen to invent characters and stories behind the architecture. At least I presume they are invented--I cannot see how he could possibly have authentic sources for these stories.
5,so You Think You Know Appalachia and the Ozarks?,"Donald Harington is a brilliant writer--he should be better known. He's captured the language, the personalities, the culture, and the attitudes, common to the Ozarks. He has said that those in Appalachia who were too individualistic for that setting--too solitary, too nomadic--made their way from Appalachia to the Ozarks. Harington writes about the village of ""Stay More"" in the Arkansas Ozarks--and the ""Ingledew"" family, over six generations. My father's family came from the Missouri/Illinois Ozarks, so I know how acutely Harington ""caught"" the setting--both South and North. The book is entirely comic and entirely serious--trust me! It's a great read. Some books I ""gulp down""--this one I finished in four settings. Maybe not quite as good as Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain--but in that league."
2,Stay Less....,"To be honest I didn't finish this book about the Ingledew's and the town of Stay More, Arkansas. I downloaded it because of the many comments about how funny it was and because at the time I was visiting family in Arkansas and I thought it would be interesting. The book was not at all funny to me and the characters themselves had no depth to them. I'm not sure if the architecture descriptions sprinkled throughout the book were supposed to be based on any kind of factual information or not, but it did not add much to the book and as others have noted the terms are not accurate. The relationship between the first characters in the book was the most interesting, but the Indian character quickly disappeared. I'm sure they have made this first book available for free in hopes of getting you interested in buying the rest, but all it did for me was make me certain I want to read nothing more by this author who does nothing to hold the interest of the reader and for this reader, no comedy."
3,Not sure,This is a vey different story. More like a long and totally outragious line of lies. Then I think again about some of the old stories I heard growing up about relatives in North Carolina and I think maybe it's not so wrong. Need to read this one in shorter pieces. You have to stop and think about how different their lives were.
3,funny.......but,This book might have been funny?? but it did not pique my interest enough to finish reading it. The story line was just too unbelievable and low class for me; someone else maybe would think it might be a great read. Just not my cup of tea.
1,Juvenile,"Reading this book was pure torture. The characters are idiots and I felt like an idiot for reading the book. Actual citizens of the Ozarks must be insulted by this portrayal of their homes and their lives. This book was so bad it's not even worth the 99 cents I paid for it. I have deleted this book from my kindle and I would not purchase, borrow or receive for free any other book from this author."
1,not for me,I bought this book because I grew up in that general area and I thought the book would be interesting. I did finish the book but I did not enjoy it and could not recommend it.
2,Annoying!,"I thought the idea behind this book was fascinating, but the reality of the book is just plain annoying. The most annoying part of this book was the odd ""viewpoint."" There is a first person narrator who was trying to write from a third person omniscient viewpoint but then keeps intruding into the tale with ""I's"" and ""we's"" though he was never any part of the story.The author uses a lot of architecture related words without explanation or definition. When I try to look them up in the Kindle dictionaries, they aren't there.The characters are more stereotypes than real people. Not only are most of them unlikable, most of them are just plain boring. I don't really care about them.This book gives me the literary equivalent of ""the frakes."" I just want to crawl into bed and stay instead of clicking to the next chapter to find out what building they move into next."
3,It's okay... worth the .99 cents that I paid for it.,"Well... I had high hopes for this book after reading some of the reviews. I grew up in the Arkansas Ozarks and actually had family that lived in a Holler that we would go visit on occasion. This book just fell short for me. Some things were funny and some things just left me hanging. You don't understand until the end who is actually the voice of the book and I found it completely strange. Because it was told in this voice... a lot was missing from the characters... what they felt, or thought. That said, I never got to know the characters very well... there were some unanswered questions that kind of made me mad that I was just left hanging. I think the book could have been a lot better... there was real potential to make it great, but it was just okay for me. I got the book for .99 cents which I feel that's a good price. If I would have paid more, I would have been upset."
2,dissappointed,It didn't follow the book at all. Time sequences were out. Things that happened....in real life...either happened earlier or later in the movie. acting was good.
2,Poor Quality Video,"The VHS tape I received is not the original issue of this movie but a re-release by GoodTimes Home Video. Instead of being recorded and playing back at SP (Standard Play) speed, it is recorded and plays back at LP (Long Play) speed that significantly reduces video quality. The playback speed information would have stopped me from buying this movie although given the difficulty of finding a better copy, I am keeping the copy that I purchased. The real problem for me is that this film has never been released on DVD."
2,the silence of the north,"Tom Skeritt, Ellen Burstyn, and John Heard, do a magnificent job in this ""gold rush hits Alaska"" film. Tom Skeritt and his new bride (Burstyn) leave civilization for Alaska unskilled and woefully ill-prepared for the life threatening existence their new world has in store for them. When all seems to be lost, Heard, stable and mature, helps salvage the day. A beautiful film, with great scenery."
4,Silence of the North,"I was thrilled to find this movie I was looking for over a long period of time. I was a little disappointed it was VHS not DVD but hey, at least I got to see it again after all these years !!"
4,"Very Embraceable, But Badly Edited...","For a vocal trance CD released almost 10 years ago, this is still a wonderful collection of songs. The enhanced material is only OK (it's of 2 music videos which you can only get to if you play it in a PC.The only real issue with this (& it's a biggie, I'm came very close to giving this 3 stars instead of 4 over it) is the fact that some of the songs are badly edited from their original versions. Like ""How Do You Feel."" The Cyber Trance mix of this song is nearly 8 minutes long, 3 minutes longer than the version here.Despite this, it's still a wonderful CD for dance/trance fans. Though if you want the full versions of the edited songs, you may want to find the 2-disc version which includes the full versions of the edited songs found here."
5,THE BEST FRAGMA ALBUM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM EVER BY FRAGMA!!!!!! IT IS A SPECIAL 2 DISC EDITION!!!!!!!!! DAMAE HAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL VOICE!!!!!! A FEW OF MY FAVOURITE SONGS ARE:TIME AND TIME AGAINEMBRACESAY THAT YOU'RE HEREMAN IN THE MOONJUST LIKE A TEAR DROPONLY YOUFREE YOUR MINDTHIS ALBUM IS TRULY INCREDIBLE!!!!!! THE SYNTHESISERS IN THE BACGROUND MAKE THIS ALBUM SO BEAUTIFUL, ESPECIALLY IN THE SONG ""MAN IN THE MOON"" DAMAE KLEIN'S VOICE IS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL AND SWEET!!! THIS ALBUM IS DEFINATELY WORTH BUYING BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST ALBUM YOU WILL EVER BUY!!!!!!!! THE PRODUCERS ARE TRULY GENIUSES IN THIS GENRE OF DANCE/TRANCE!!!!!!"
4,Great in parts,Bought it for ray brown. Jimmy was new to me but very pleasantly surprised on most tracks. Particularly liked looking back and the version of that's all
5,"Dreamlike, disturbing, arousing...","The stories and novella in this collection are fascinating and quite beautiful. Some evoke painful thoughts of a love-or-was-it-lust that can never be recaptured, others are sweet and satisfying - despite (or because of?) dealing with various taboo relationships. If you're interested in thoughtful gay erotica - or in vignettes about relationships, with an erotic tone - you might appreciate ""Hasty Hearts""."
4,One Of the best cd's of the Early 90's,Tylers second cd came out at a time when the the industry was blind to real talent. She's beautiful and has a beautiful voice.My fave tracks on this cd are..-It doesn't matter..meanigful lyrics-just make me the one..has funky groove-i've never really known love..nice acoustic song-i can't stand the pain...ballad that showcases her voice
4,A Lost Gem,"Whatever happened to Tyler Collins?This CD is one of her best.Her sound digs right to the core of your soul.The funky beat of ""Slide"" & the playful song called ""Just make me the one"".The CD has 11 tunes and there isn't a dud in the bunch.If you can find this CD and your a fan of soul.BUY IT! Come back Tyler Collins I'm your biggest fan and the music world needs you as well."
4,That's my girl!!,"Tyler is SO amazingly talented and I would LOVE for her to record another album. She is a great dancer,singer,and actress and beautiful too. When I was a pre-teen I used to try to wear my hair just like hers! I remember going to see her live in concert and she was stunning. The last thing I've seen her appear on was Britney Spears' album in 2001 as a background vocalist. If you have any other updates please post them!!"
2,whitewashed R&B,ah yes bland watered down white bread adult pop/R&B with adult contemporary sensibilities from the early 90's.pretty much the R&B equivalent to early 90's pop-rap.*ugh* one of the few things i hated about the 90's was how everything in the mainstream was PSEUDO-URBAN.
3,Delivery took longer than expected,"The book was in very good condition, but it took longer than expected to receive it."
5,Excellent Aplication of Systems Theory to Executive Coaching!,"I highly recommend this book to new and seasoned coaches. Not only is it enjoyable to read, but the author presents a clear description of the application of systems theory to executive coaching. There are a number of coaching books that describe coaching skills, but O'Neill's book provides a solid theoretical framework for applying these skills.Sabrina Starling Schleicher, Ph.D.Licensed PsychologistExecutive and Life Coach"
4,Courage & Compassion: Key Coaching Competencies,"If you are going to be a good executive coach, you will need both courage and compassion -- backbone and heart. Mary Beth takes you inside the executive coaching session to illustrate how to balance these two critical coaching competencies. She challenges those of us who coach to raise our own awareness levels. Well-written and thought provoking.* Mark Kelly, coauthor of MASTERING TEAM LEADERSHIP: 7 ESSENTIAL COACHING SKILLS"
4,Insightful!,"Mary Beth O'Neill describes how executive coaches need to work with executives as partners to help them become better leaders. Coaches need the strength to share the truth with clients in times of crisis, she explains. She discusses the core principles that underlie coaching and the four essential phases of the coaching process: contracting, planning, live-action intervening and debriefing. The book is primarily directed to coaches, including consultants and internal or external trainers, who facilitate processes and projects in organizations. While it has its share of fuzzy and jargon-laden patches, the book is generally clear and to the point. It includes a mix of examples, charts, and step-by-step techniques, plus useful chapter highlights. We [...] recommend this book to coaches, to executives who are coaching employees and to executives who are being coached."
4,Excellent dance music,"Forget the fact that they used a model in the videos instead of the real singers (as was done with C+C Music Factory and Milli Vanilli), the music and the vocals are fantastic. This CD contains remixed versions of their hits ""Strike it Up"", ""Everybody Everybody"", ""I Don't Know Anybody Else"", and ""Ride on Time"" as well as album cuts ""Open Your Eyes"" and ""Fantasy"" (a remake of the Earth, Wind & Fire tune). If you are looking for the original versions, you may be disappointed with this disc. However, the remixes here don't stray too far from the original versions played on the radio. Often the versions played at clubs were different that the versions played on the radio anyway, so it just depends on how you remember these songs. If you were not in clubs in 90-91, these versions may sound different or unfamiliar to you. However, the music is good, the remixes are good, and I recommend this CD."
3,coach for the ages,coach Wooden ranks amongst the best ever; Carty isn't bad - a little too religious for me personally
2,Not What I Expected.,"This book is 50% Bible stories. While I love the basic philosophy I didn't understand that one half of the book was written by a minister, who is exclusively telling bible stories. Choose a different book on Wooden's philosophy."
2,His brilliance didn't translate well.,"He was a brilliant coach and amazing human, but his philosophy of success doesn't translate into a book. Very amateurish, and over the top religious."
2,make sure you know what this book really is before you buy it.,"I purchased this on a recomendation from a friend as a good sports coaching book. I did not expect it to be so much of a bible study, however because he didn't mention that aspect of the book. I have nothing against that persay, but the constant biblical references and prayers make the book more a work of evalgalism than practical sports coaching wisdom and advice."
3,Good for a Bible study,"This book was written as a Bible study. The book derives many quotes and ideas from several Bible verses. At the end of each chapter, the reader is ""suggested"" to carefully read several Bible verses for Christian edification. The book does not appear to have an another reference than the Bible. To be fair, many of the ideas and thoughts written in this book are great and worthwhile for contemplation. But why wasn't this book marketed as a religious book? I think all readers should be made aware that this book is for Christians and those who are interested in learning about Christianity. I must give this book only 3 stars for its lack of forthrightness in its marketing."
2,More religion than inspiration,"I purchased this book based on the enthusiasm of other reviews. I was hoping for more of a success/motivational book. It's not at all what I thought it would be. I am only about 1/4 through it, but very little of the book is Wooden--2/3 of each block of the pyramid is taken up by the coauthor's religious discussions and quotations. I don't recommend it unless religion is what you really enjoy."
3,Casca's Japanese adventure,Casca ends up washed ashore in feudal Japan and is taken under the wing of expert swordsman Jinto Muramasa and together the two embark on a bloody spree through Japan to bring a warlord to victory over his deadly rivals.The passage relating to the manufacture of a sword is brilliantly done and some aspects of Japanese court ritual are interesting but sometimes the plot wears a little thin and some of it feels like its mere filling. But nonetheless its a good story and worth keeping.For the world of Casca see www.casca.net
3,Good live-show from 1969.,"Once again, these are not Bill's original recordings. This is a live-show recorded 1969 in New York's Bitter End club. The sound is o.k., Bill is very relaxed, the band does a good job. Sad but true: Even a major company like BMG tries to cheat the record buyer. Why do they call it an ""Encore Collection""? It's ""Bill's Greatest Hits Live"", nothing else."
1,Too basic,The book does not address restaurant location at all. It is just a list of sites where you might find some data. Really bad.
4,Not great but worth the $$$!,"Although specificity is lacking, there is much information of value to anyone considering establishing a restaurant.Unlike Buying & Selling A Restaurant Business, this book is worth the price even though, after reading it, you will want to do a lot more research on the web and at your local library. The writer does a good job telling you where to get the information and how to obtain information that is useful, with bias minimized.LJ's Breaking Free$ newsletter will be trying to excerpt to this booklet in its eZine and magazine - Bill Anderson, (LJ)."
2,Disappointing instrumental hymns,"I was very disappointed with this instrumental collection of hymns. They all seem to be played by one person on a keyboard, although occasionally the keyboard is used to simulate more than one instrument. The playing is bland and without energy."
1,Not much new here,"This book might appeal to SEAL wannabes, but anyone else should skip it. This is advertised as a novel, but there is no plot or storyline anywhere in sight. It is another of the many books recently published along the line of ""See how tough the SEALS are"". While I have the utmost respect for the US Navy SEALS, this book is simply another recitation of BUD/S and Hell Week.SEAL wannabes and SEAL fans might apppreciate it because the author is well-known in the SEAL community. This book appears to be a thinly disguised autobiography of the author's own BUD/S experience. There are a lot better SEAL books out there."
5,From an Insider,"CMC Chalker tells the story of Hell Week from both the perspective of a student and an instructor. While at times the book seems chaotic and disjointed, it works, given that Hell Week itself is chaotic and disjointed. I would have liked to have read more about Hell Week from the point of view of an instructor, but understand that the book is supposed to be about the students.Some editing could have been done on the book, as some details are repeated in different places."
1,There Are Better Books On Parental Narcissism,"The author herself is the victim of parental narcissism, and so she wrote a book about this very destructive form of emotional abuse, ostensibly to help other victims. But, it's really a vehicle to talk specifically about herself and her own experiences. Very little of it is useful to a wider audience. She claims to be a healed child of narcissistic parents; odd that she spends so much time talking about herself.This book may work as a very basic introduction to the topic for some, but if you're serious about getting some help, get ""Children of the Self-Absorbed"" instead. It has much wider-ranging and more practical advice than this one does."
2,Solutions would be nice.,"This book has a lot of value in terms of recognition: I was able to see myself, my family structures, and how the influence of narcissistic parents plays out in adult life. But I was unsettled by the sense that Golumb is still angry at her situation, and hasn't truly found a new way of looking at life. When I read a self-help or psychology book, I need a guide who is integrated, self-actualized. Witnessing someone else's struggle is not enough for me; I question what she has to offer. I finished the book wondering if there really was any hope for children of narcissistic parents.Of course the answer is Yes, but I couldn't tell from this book.It was interesting reading, and is well-written, but I'd advise checking it out at the library before buying."
3,"Helpful, but not hopeful","I agree with another reviewer that while the material is very illuminating, the author offers little in the way of solutions. I ended up feeling kind of hopeless after reading it, like ""Well, here is where you are, good luck getting yourself out of it"". It is also noteworthy that the author, herself the child of narcissists, saw no value in anyone's recovery but her own, as her examples pointed out time and time again. These kinds of 'narcissistic comparisons' are further examples of the problem, in my view. An interesting primer, but it will only take you part of the way."
2,Should be only 3 chapters long!,"This book is only worth it for the first 3 chapters, which are good. They don't help you DEAL with your parent's narcissism, but they do explain it very well, if you are like everyone else and have been going, ""what the heck is happening?"" for most of your life! Beyond that, it is like other reviewers have written: it is mostly the author trying to deal with her own situation, and offering up semi-relevant case histories of her patients. One of the chapters, ""The Child of a Narcissist Who Becomes a Narcissist,"" should feature the author, not ""Alan,"" because it's pretty obvious early on that she is deeply wounded, and became one herself as a result of her upbringing, which she may or may not realize. Repeating, the book is worth it if you are willing to pay for only about 50 pages of real info. Otherwise, skip it."
2,"Lots of ""stories"" but not much to glean from them","I found this book to be very disappointing. While there were some informative bits here and there, too much of the book was filled with stories... ""stories"" about people that are narcissists or who have someone in their life that is. And through all the stories, I didn't feel there was anything to learn. After reading 1/3 of the book, I flipped through the rest, looking for any nuggets, and found very few... certainly not enough to read the book completely from beginning to end."
3,begins better than it ends,"At first I found this book immensely clarifying in its description of narcissism and its effects--as described in the various ""cases."" Ultimately, however, I did not find the chapters promising help to be especially helpful; there are more case studies in a briefer format and Golomb's own background interjected repeatedly. While descriptively helpful, there was, for me, a sense of frustration with the dramatic language and the obvious anger in the text. I expected more hopefulness, and its lack was distressing. Still, I think the book has much to teach and is well worth the time. It rings true to my own experience."
2,Fails to balance the objective and the subjective,"I think this book makes some good points about narcissistic parents, especially if this territory is unfamiliar to the reader. Unfortunately the points are meandering at times, the organization is confusing, and the examples used in the book strike me as too personal and not objective. For a recovered child of narcissistic parents, the author sure spends a lot of time talking about herself."
5,"Great book for understanding ""narcissistic"" behavior","TRAPPED IN THE MIRROR is an wonderful title for a highly readable book that helps the lay person recognize, understand and deal with self-absorbed people. Whereas a child need a parent as a mirror, in the narcissistic scenario the roles are sadly reversed. The child become the mirror for whatever the parent loves or hates about herself/himself. The damage is enormous as the child's identity takes a back seat to the narcissist's infantile needs.Reading this book was extremely valuable to me. I found it more helpful than the other books I've purchased and read on the same subject."
3,OK product,I like that the product came as it was described. I read it and got something out of the content
1,Pointless and Self Absorbed,"Author IS trapped in the mirror. It became so tiresome to constantly read in detail of her thoughts of herself. Anecdotes of others were in a detached form of narration (as if impersonally describing a movie scene) and self serving, inserted whenever the author seemed to become briefly aware that she talked incessantly of herself, took a break from herself, and then circled right back into her detailed self absorption. It appears that she wrote her conclusions first, then wrote the anecdotes to use as ""proofs"" for the conclusions. This book supposedly offered self healing, yet at the end, she states, ""it is inappropriate for me to recommend a course of action"". Then why write the book? To painfully tell everyone about yourself and your life course? Just like life with a narcissist, there was the promise made, dragged out, and never delivered, all while focused on herself. What a waste of good money. Looking for a better book? Take a look at ""Stalking the Soul""."
2,NEED HELP? DON'T READ THIS.,"If you are looking for a book that will help you cope with narcissistic abuse from your parents, spouses, or bosses...look elsewhere. The author is seethingly resentful of her emotionally bullying father, and a good part of the book is a series of autobiographical vignettes about her inability to stand up to him after all these years. If she still can't take care of herself , don't think she can help you on your way to emotional strength."
1,"Great title, disappointing content","I'm very well-read in the psychologic literature, and have a father and a brother who are classic narcissists. The author describes them well, but doesn't distinguish between parental influence and genetic traits---i.e., my brother is just like my father, I am just like my mother. Also, sadly, the author herself is clearly a narcissist herself...there is so much self-centeredness, grandiosity, and quickness to take offense at small things......My advice: skip this book and keep searching!"
1,Waste of Money and Bookshelf Space,"Wish I never bought it, waste of $$-the book captured me in the first few chapters, but as I read on, I became bored and also had the uncomfortable feeling that I was indeed reading a book hat is the product of a ...narcissist, one who happened to have gotten a degree. I don't feel the book is very professional at all, and while it is nice to have authors share SOME of their own experiences, this book can only be considered a purging of the author's soul, not at all a self-help book, or one that offers anything to the reader.I also wonder if the author's patients need to endure endless stories of her own pain, rather than have her listen to them, which is the career she has chosen."
2,Anecdotal at best,"This book was frustrating. I kept waiting for answers, and all I got was anecdotal evidence of a woman and her brother. There are better books..."
5,The Library Journal is absolute rubbish. This book is outstanding,This book was a life changer for me. Reading this and working with a councilor unlocked the cage I was in and help free me.Buy the book. Take your time and read it. It is worth the journey.
2,Disappointing...,"After seeing others' reviews I greatly looked forward to reading this book. But I found it not much more than the author's extended personal journal and catharsis. The stories from her own life and those of her friends and patients could have been useful if they were better edited and surrounded by insightful analysis. But instead, the stories go on and on - after a while I found myself skipping the long narratives to glean some useful information. It may be worth checking out of the library."
1,Author Still Trapped,"What a mess of a book! How this poorly written book by this self-centered and offensive author ever found a publisher is a mystery. Elan's anger comes across loudly, clearly and uncomfortably. I imagine the author as tedious at a ""cocktail party"" given her penchant for probing and analyzing all her acquaintances and coming up, remarkably, with the same diagnosis each time. The book read like one unconnected or tenuously connected rant to another. Much of the language was ambiguous. I often read sentences and paragraphs over and over trying to comprehend just what Elan was attempting to convey. In some cases, the premise was so poorly constructed it evaded this reader entirely. Readers seeking to understand narcissism and equip themselves with survival tools are better served by author Sam Vaknin; Narcissistic Lovers by Zayn and Dibble and especially by Wizard of Ox and Other Narcissists."
1,Waste of money and time.,"The introduction was godd but that's about it. The rest of the book is about a series of examples and that's all. No real analysis, explanation or substance."
4,Good service,Received book in good time and fairly good condition. Not a problem since I ordered it used.
1,Useless,This is a really useless book about narcissism. There's no logic to its organizing principles -- mainly rather bloodless personal stories that lack enervating details. Really unhelpful and unenjoyable.
1,"Spiteful, bitter, self-absorbed, and depressing","Ms. Golomb's clearly lacks the capacity to see her parents in anything other than a negative light. If, as she says at one point, no one is black or white, why does she fail through 262 pages to demonstrate this with her parents, who, along with the author, are the primary characters of the book.The writing is mediocre; there is too little perspective; too little guidance; too much psychobabble; and the metaphors Ms. Golomb is fond of using more often than not are either confusing or utterly miss the mark. I'm glad this woman is not my therapist."
3,Helpful,"I found this book a little hard to read but very helpful. I was able to identify my narcissistic traits inherited from my upbringing, which before always eluded identification because I had no way to recognise them. When traits like these are recognised, it puts you in a better position to observe, and eventually minimize their influences. This book may not be difinitive, but It provided a means to see these influences at work witin myself, and possibly to break/weaken my family's cycle of narcissism from infecting my children. A good read if you can stay with it."
3,Mixed bag,"As a child of narcissistic parents, I found myself and my experience time and again on the pages of this book. While I wasn't impressed by Golomb's writing style, I was excited and amazed every time I picked up the book to learn the reasons for many of my reactions and responses in life. I found her descriptions of the effects of narcissism on children to be much more interesting than the individual case histories. Best of all, just reading about the effects of narcissism helped me conquer some situational fears that had been plaguing me for a long time. Seeing the pathology of having had narcissistic parents described in this book empowered me! I highly recommend this book."
5,Excellent Character Building Bible Study!,"The rules in this set are based on biblical values. Although each rule is strongly biblically based, the author has chosen to allow each family to choose their own verse to include with each rule. Each rule set has its own small poster and a comical picture (drawn by the author's son) which children can color. This set is excellent! We have used it in our homeschooling curriculum with very young children, and it has proven to be a wonderful addition. I strongly recommend that every family utilize this set!"
3,Great Idea but...,"First the positive. This is a great idea. I particularly like the pictures that you can color while you discuss the rule. The rules are also stated in a positive manner.However, like another reviewer I would like to state that these rules are cumbersome and reptitive. Turn off what you turn on, shut what you open etc.These have been used in our home and will be used in the future as my younger children grow up. They are used as discussion items for what the rules in our home are right now. Be obedient to your parents, don't create extra work for others, be respectful. These are some of our own family rules. And we use the coloring pages and 21 rules as examples of what we expect.I would probably not pay the money for this book again. However, having it in our home is not a mistake and it has lent itself to our own home rules."
1,Product features unnecessary discipline,"I thought all the rules were great. Although I was offended by the illustration for rule 21. The rule in itself is a good rule,""When we disobey or forget any of the 21 rules of this house, we accept discipline and instruction,"" but the illustration featured a young boy sitting on his dad's lap with a paddle in his father's hand. This kind of discipline is not allowed in our house and I do not think that it is appropriate to expose children to this kind of abuse. I quickly sent it back because I didn't even want it in my house. I just wanted to warn people before they bought this product."
2,Beware,I have Verizon phone service and this phone will not work with the DSL filter that is required by Verizon. I have never had a problem with any other phones that I have bought and used with the filters. The bad thing about this the company would not consider that a defect so I had to pay shipping to return it. I feel it is a fine line whether it is a defect. I even spoke to a manager. So buy with caution.
2,Skip this phone,"Phone has a hum or buzz which increases with the volume of the amplifier setting on the handset. The ringer bell dings from time to time for no apparent reason. Otherwise, the phone is very nice."
1,Not for the real hiker,"This book is quite disappointing in its selection and description of hikes. I also purchased Martin's 100 hikes in New Mexico for our upcoming trip there, and would recommend Martin's book much more highly over this one."
2,A little slow... surprising for these authors,"I read the first book SO FAST! I couldn't wait to find out what happened with James & Carolina. However, I had to go through the ENTIRE book (at least until half way through for some interaction between them) so this disappointed me.(and these authors are GREAT - just finished Peterson's Alasken Quest series- LOVED IT). I LOVE historical fiction and learning about different periods. However, this was a little too much history and not enough on the interaction of characters that held the first book. I am about to start the 3rd book (looking forward to it) so I hope it's better."
3,good but a little slow,"This is the second book in the ribbons of steel series. After reading the first book, your expecting to find out what happens between Carolina and James. Well nothing happens between them until the end of this book. It's like the authors are trying to keep you interested in their series by dragging the story out as long as possible. And by the way, in the first book James seemed like an okay guy who is a little weak. In the second book, you find out he really is a wimp who doesn't deserve Carolina. I'm somewhat interested in the railroad but the authors assume that you want to know everything that they've learned about the railroad in their research. It would be a better book with a little less detail about the railroad and more interaction among characters."
4,slow moving but a good book,I love the details of the oppulence before Civil War. moves very slow but good story and entertaining
5,Ribbons of Steel Series,"This is a wonderful series.......could hardly put the books down!! This series has all the elements......excitement, danger, romance and all with a wonderful christian message..."
5,A must have for any interior decorating wanna-be.,"This is an INCREDIBLE book. There are tons of good practical suggestions, but what sets this book apart is its ability to customize the end result (your home) to the type of person you are and the kind of home you have. Rather than being the typical ""do this, try that"" decorating manual, Spirit of the Home starts by getting you in touch with the philosophy and psychology behind creating a home. And in the end, the creative changes to your home wind up being YOUR inspirations, not the tips of some random author who's never met you or seen your house. GET IT ... IT'S GREAT & AN EASY READ."
5,Amazing!,"It does not matter if you have an apartment or a mansion, Spirit of the Home is your tool for transforming your home from livable to lovable. I found the information regarding the ancient Japanese art of Feng Shui insightful and quite practical in several aspects. I would recommend it to anyone in search of creating a home that you will want to come home to."
2,Lots of information but not enough pictures,"I enjoy reading, but I am a very visual person and was disappointed in this book because while it offers suggestions that make sense, it takes longer to get through the book since it is practically all words and very few pictures for inspiration."
4,Rich girl tackles tough case head-on,"Joan Crawford plays a flapper queen whose rich father commits suicide after the stock market crash. Rather than whining in victimhood she gets a job as a newspaper reporter and attempts to crack the case of a gangland killing of another reporter (Cliff Edwards). Clark Gable, she learns, is the gang leader and her brother (William Bakewell) has been duped into committing the murder. The picture is a nifty and tough crime drama, and both Crawford and Gable, who weren't stars yet, make it plain why they would be in just a short time. The acting is somewhat stiff and stagy, due to the primitive sound-camera technology of the day, but the principals overcome this shortcoming better than most actors could at the time. Still worth a watch."
3,Warning!,This is a DVD-R transfer that is a part of the Warner Archive. It is available directly from the Warner Archive site for only $19.95. Why pay more?
4,not the greatest dead russian,"the language of the stories is a little stilted, but it is tough to tell if that is gogol's fault or that of his translator (it is definitely time for a new translation). the stories range in all types and quality, though gogol is at his best when leaning towards the fantastique (kafkaesque comes mind). there are some good stories in the collection: diary of a madman (the only story that is genious), the portrait (gogol ruins what would have been his greatest story with a poorly written, unneccesary second half), the nose, the overcoat, and taras bulba (though a bit wordy and does carry on a little too long). vol 2 is by superior volume (if the editor's introduction and diary of a madman had been in it, there would be no point to volume one)."
4,"a great movie, my daughter wants the whole series!","My 5 year old daughter loves this movie. she says her favorite parts are, ""Everything!"" She wants more videos in this series. I like that the movie is interesting during the performances and fun during the ballet lessons. It is a little difficult for her so this video may be best for girls a little bit older (the only reason why I gave it 4 stars). This is a very beautiful movie so I would recommend it to anybody else who wants a ballet video for their kids. MUCH better then other ballet videos we have purchased."
3,A disappointment,"My 5 year old LOVES the Prima Princessa Nutcracker dvd so I assumed she'd love this one too. Although she's very outgoing and confident, she does seem to be a little more 'sensitive' than other kids her age to the *evil* characters portrayed in Disney movies etc. So she doesn't like this ballet because of the 'evil fairy' who puts everyone to sleep. She's watched it once and doesn't want to see it again. Such a pity since these DVD's are so cute. For some reason the rats in the Nutcracker are OK but the evil fairy is not! Who can reason with a 5 year old? Maybe I'll try the Swan Lake one instead."
3,Not for sensitive youngsters,"I got this DVD for my 4-year-old daughter, who loves the Prima Princessa Nutcracker and Swan Lake DVDs. She was really excited to watch Sleeping Beauty, but we didn't even make it through the first half because she was so unsettled by the ""evil fairy"" character in the ballet. The costumes and makeup are stunning, and fascinating for an older audience, but I could easily see why it would be so disturbing to younger children, especially those who tend to be more sensitive to portrayals of evil or strong conflict in the media.I don't have an issue with the ballet itself, but rather with the choice by Prima Princessa to feature this particular ballet for its DVDs. The DVDs are obviously marketed to preschool-aged kids, and there was no indication on the packaging-- in the description or the images-- of such potentially disturbing material for the younger age-group."
2,For very little girls,"The description promised parts of the ballet,AB school students demonstration in between and tea party after "" the ballet is over"". Instead the ""after ballet is over"" party, there are little girls trying to dance in between ballet parts and ""student from AB demonstration"" and that fills about 1/3 of the movie.All the pieces and comments are repeated twice - my 4yr old found that very annoying and even started crying that she already have seen this.The ballet and ""students demonstration"" were good but if you would divide by 2 the length of the DVD (to compensate for repeating parts) and minus 1/3 of what's left (for little girls movements )- that would be the time of any valuable info on the DVD(15 min max).It maybe a good one to watch for 2-3 yr old, but on the other hand, the actual ballet terms and the ballet itself, probably, would be too advanced for that age group."
3,Not a high-quality item,This mic was relatively inexpensive but the sound quality for voice recording was less than I expected. It picked up a lot of background noise while making the main focus of the recording muffled and distorted.And There was a hissing Noise in the background.
1,poorly made,"this is a cheaply made hong congproduct ,amazon should not sell thisvery flimey , poor recognitiongo with a koss, !!!!I do not have the card boad backingand can not return it, what a waste of time and money!"
2,"Better title - ""The Big Book of Stuff I Like""","Yes, 2001 was a better film than Oliver! Yes, Singin' in the Rain is better than The Greatest Show On Earth. Yes, It's a Wonderful Life is better than The Best Years of Our Lives. But they didn't win. Why not? Because they weren't as highly regarded on their intitial release as they are now. It's as simple as that. Each year can only be looked at as a snapshot of that moment in time, not the be-all and end-all of opinions.And opinions is really all this book is about. Peary feels the need to state his loud and clear, preferring it to the AMPAS voters and expecting us to the same. Thanks, but no thanks.That being said, many of the short essays on films are very good. This would be much better as a book of criticism. But ""Alternate Oscars"" is a bad idea."
5,Very cute,"This pool is very cute and roomy! I bought this for my 4yr. old and she loves it. It's not small like the usual kiddie pool, it's room enough for a 4yr. old and a bunch of her pool toys. It's also very durable, I aired it up once and my daughter has used it just about everyday. I recommend this pool for older toddlers, it's the perfect size."
1,Junk,"Maybe 40 years ago this passed for a book on knots, not today. With so many good books about knots and ropework available, there is absolutely no reason to get this one. I felt cheated out of my money when I actually started to go through the book in detail. The illustrations don't match the text, and in some cases are just plain wrong. I collect books on ropework, knots and rigging and currently own dozens. This is the first one I considered throwing away."
2,Disappointing,"A good selection of knots, but some illustrations have errors. Other problems: there is a picture of each knot as it's being laid, but not of the knot as it appears when dressed (tightened) -- this can make a huge difference for some of them. Also, the text doesn't tell you how to use the knot, what it's good for, or when you might want to use it.This is not a bad intro book, all in all, but I'd be happier with something more thorough, better illustrated, and with more detailed text."
3,Who needs this?,"Why would they include 3 different recordings of Getting In Tune, Won't Get Fooled Again and Behind Blue Eyes but not manage to include live versions of My Wife, and Baba O'Riley, two of the best songs on the original album? Who's in charge at Decca anyway?"
3,i wanna no why ?,I am a huge who fan but why are all their re-issues on cd edited or re mixed. live at leeds second release with the tommy songs added was edited or remixed especially noticable on my generation and shakin all over. Now I know some splicing was going on on the original relese (vinyl) but to listen to a live album for twenty years and then change the content is well ??? I dont Know? What ever happened to the live quadrophenia show that King Biscuit was supposed to release ?I'll stick with my vinyl on this one.
2,What the Heck?,"Download was missing 1st 4-5 songs""Bargain"" etc. Was very confused,disappointed and actually,angry. I think there was some type of error in downloading."
5,"One of the ""Essentials"".","This is The Who at their best (studio-wise). Every song is 'classic' (gee, I'm hating that word). Every song is a masterpiece in and of itself (there...that's better). Songs of love, misery, rebellion, and strength; this one runs the whole course of rock music and runs it better than most others. For those who are just discovering rock music in its purest form, try this one out and then, try out The Who 'Live at Leeds' as a follow-up to this one."
3,Will Get Fooled Again!,"Yet another reissue of this classic album, Deluxe Edition offers very little that's new. While the geniuses at MCA have included still more bad alternate versions they forgot other classic songs written around the same time: Time Is Passing, Here For More, The Seeker, I Don't Even Know Myself, Greyhound Girl, Too Much Of Anything, etc.The most interesting thing about this latest retread is the live set on disc 2. The band sounds like they didn't rehearse. Keith Moon is especially out of sync. At least the set is varied.This collection is for die hard Who fans only.[DW]"
1,not so good,led zeppelin was much better! there's no good lyrics! the songs are terrible! melodies! behind blue eyes is better made by limp bizkit!
1,You thought he was gone....you thought the world was safe but MRe is here to save the day....,"Today we tast The rare Who beverage Who's Next, now when I taste The Who Next or Who is here or oh whatever, I get a zeesty, a crappy, a disgustingly hidiously zingerly terrible taste.I wouldn't want this with my tea & crumpets, or with my friends for the weekly dinner now. Yes it has a Babo Rileo & a get fooled encore, but the rest is sadly dingy & less zingy & the singer can't singy, I get a emromour of I should listen to Mariah, Celine or Britney but not this thingy!!!P.SThe E stands for Expert!!!"
5,"I heard this the week it came out, way back in the 70's",This album was played for me by my older brother just the same week it came out in the 70's on vinyl at his apartment and I loved it back then. I still love it but now I can keep it on my phone for me to play whenever I want. How cool is that.
5,The Who on SACD is a must!,"Upon my first listen I did notice that the high frequencies were a little on the low side. But you know what - if you like the sound of records, then this can be really refreshing. Too much high information will have you turning the volume down instead of up. The Who demand high volumes! For each successive song, I ended up turning the volume up higher and higher to really grasp the detail of this recording. The sound stage is amazing. SACD is incredible in this regard. Roger Daltrey's voice comes alive on this recording. Reminds me of some MFSL LP recordings where the vocals stand out more. And Keith Moon's drums sound more alive. Guitar work and bass are way more accurate sounding. This is a must purchase, especially if you like to hear the Who loud! Don't pass this SACD up..."
5,Rock and Roll Bible Vol.1,"Indispensible is the only word to sum up this masterwork by The Who. Every song flows seemlessly to the next. The classics are here in spades: Baba O'Riley, Bargain, Behind Blue Eyes, Won't Get Fooled Again. However, it's the lesser know tracks from Who's Next which truly make this The Who's career defining piece. The Song is Over, Naked Eye and Goin' Mobile no doubt rank among some of my all-time favorite songs. Townsend's craftsmanship is nothing less than stellar, his playing flawless. Daltrey's vocals, Townsend's guitar, Entwistle's Bass and Moon's percussion validate The Who's claim that they are the Best Rock and Roll Band in the World and Who's Next is all the evidence you'll need."
5,No one would want to be next!,"No one is next. Because being next would certainly mean having to follow a strong act, and most who would try will come up short. This is one of the seminal albums in the history of rock music.We all get to hear ""Baba O'Reilly"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" with some regularity on oldies stations. There is so much more here, though. Those classics are supported by other driving rock, like ""Bargain"", ""Gettin In Tune"" and the sweet starting, but hard finishing ""Behind Blue Eyes""Another one of those desert island albums. A collection of rock music cannot be complete without this masterpiece.Sheer sonic power. 'nuff said."
1,Who are you??,"Hi, I'm Tommy (no kidding).My father gave me this old CD with music. I was under the impression it was all film music from the reruns of the Doctor Who series and I was expecting exciting synthesizer space rock but it goes without saying I was bitterly disappointed by this grandpa weasel crap. The voices are indistinguishable and NOT!! at all about extraterrestrials or spooking mysteries. This instead is lame 'she left me I am a dumb wino' music.It should be bent from being displaced in the shops.I have a decent name for this collection: WHO needs it?????????Tommy Reighley"
1,Numbers,"I have vivvid memoriess of my father playin sevral music record from his one collexion by the 70/80 poprock group Numbers. They were an american ensemble of four or five members and played to rock the place. I believe they had 3 or maybe 2 dics before the contract broke after illusory troubles.Anyway I found this CD of the band called The Who? A strangest title but I thought let's play it.Well my conviction is it is rather bad and stupid, totally unlike the discs my fathers used to have about Numbers.I am thinking it must be another group.This doesnot rock at all!!!The lirrics are undetectabe and sound silly and the purformance is really like bad.Avoid this bad music and search for good stuff by the original band Numbers."
1,hose nagged,"The what? The first rogue punk group in Britton? No way! That was Alex Johns and the Spikes who were robbed from their 10 million pound contract by none other than (...) you know how it goes.Please good and decenbt folk don't take attention of all the senseless dumbass 5star reviews becuz they lie. This disc earns what it gets: a meagre 0.Listen to Shakespear sister, Cabaret voltaire, Killjoys, Cosmic apples, Lunch (with Peter Hodgwin, not the later group), Scissor sisters (invention of the century)and Madame Tussauds' Lies (Dutch band). They will be bigger in a couple of years time than this dumbo who that only Lil Ratched and Jug Barry like."
5,Newly Discovered,"I've only recently discovered the Who's music for the first time in my short life. Prior to buying the album I was familiar with a number of their songs (Baba O'Reilly, Behind Blue Eyes, Bargain) but for the most part, didn't know of their other material. All I can really say is that this has to be one of the best classic rock albums of all time. I usually view most older rock as hard to relate to but in today's scene of completely awful music this album has helped me reconnect with the whole point of rock music, which in today's music has truly been lost (with a few exceptions). This is definately a must have so any rock fan regardless of age or taste."
5,Excellent !!!,"The BEST!! Who album ever, Plus extra tracks on this great CD.This is the only Who record that had at least more air play of all songs with exception to ""Pinball Wizard"" from Tommy and ""Sqeeze Box"" from Who by numbers.You won't be fooled!Get this CD!"
5,The Who's Best,"I recently purchased this album on 180 gram virgin vinyl and the sound quality blows digital compact discs away. The vocals and drums, the cymbals, the guitars and synthesisers all sound live, natural, the way the were recorded. I own a copy of the remastered compact disc but the vinyl version is far superior to the digital sound of disc. It is like hearing the album again for the first time. A rock and roll classic!"
5,Who's Best,"Probably my favorite cover of all time along with the covers of The Velvet Underground and Nico and Rubber Soul. Anyway, Who's Next is one of the greatest albums of all time, at least top ten. Bargain, Going Mobile and Behind Blue Eyes are all great songs. However, Baba O'Riley and Won't Get Fooled Again are possibly my two favorite songs by the Who. The Who were one of the most influential and original bands in Rock history. This album is the best release of their career. Even if you just want to buy one album, don't buy a greatest hits CD, Buy Who's Next. You Won't Regret It."
4,No extras,"I too love this album. I can't say much more about this album that already hasn't been said. It is great, filled with some of the best songs of the era. My only complaint is that it is not the reissue CD that contained a few extra songs. That's my reason for 4 stars. Too bad, I would have bought it to replace the original 1984 CD release. But, if you don't have 'Who's Next', I strongly recommend it."
4,The best Who CD!,"""Who's next"" contains the most melodic, intense and innovative pieces of music ever made by the Who. Each tune is an experience to the listener - the music (and texts) awakens your senses and keeps them alive for several hours after you've turned off the music."
5,"""Getting in tune to the straight and narrow.....""","The Who is one of the legendary bands that I have sadly overlooked over the years. Aside, from The Who By Numbers, I remained ignorant and stayed away from their other albums. I don't know why. Maybe it was because I just wasn't interested in their music. Well, now that I'm more open-minded, I've taken the chance and explored Who's Next, and it's been a HUGE pleasure. I can safely say that this album is just excellent. I know that I've heard snippets of ""Baba O'Riley"" and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" now and then, but I've never heard them in full. Now, I can revel in the music completely, and it's a great experience. The other songs (such as ""Behind Blue Eyes,"" ""Getting in Tune,"" and ""Bargain"") are also brilliant. The only songs that are fairly weak are ""Love Ain't For Keeping"" and ""Going Mobile,"" but it's nothing bad. This is an excellent album by The Who, and it makes me want to explore their other albums.Grade: 9.5/10"
5,Welcome...to the 70's...,"Unlike the latter part of the decade known for its kitsch and Disco music, Rock entered the 70's with a bleary eyed hangover experienced after pulling a decade long all-nighter - jimi, janis and the beatles were gone - Altamont, Manson and Heroin replaced peace love and understanding, it was a new dawn and for one perfect moment in time the stars aligned and Rock's biggest stars actually became their most creative artists - the Who, Stones, The Kinks, Neil Young - each came out with their seminal albums through their own different paths and Rock music was never again the same. Who's Next reflected a greater optimism and sense of purpose than the Stones dark moods in Exile on Main Street or the Kinks bent toward nostalgia on Village Green but it was hard earned and paid for and stands the test of time as the Who's greatest acheivement."
5,The greatest rock'n'roll band in the world ever!!!,"Have you ever listened to rock music? That's the finest example one can give you about what's rock for. Both lyrics and music are just amazing. Pete Townshend, we may thank you forever!!! Motax, the best brazilian rock band, really loves this!"
5,Arguably the greatest Album of all time,"This album captures the passion and full force fury of the Who in the rawest material; music. With songs like ""Bargain"", ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", ""Goin' Mobile"", and ""Behind Blue Eyes"", you really can't go wrong. The Best Song on the Album? A lot of people disagree with me in saying that although ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" is a good song, I Think ""BABA O'RILEY"" is their masterpiece and it will resound forever in as THE anthem of Rock."
4,"Great, but tails off after hits","Who can deny the greatness of tracks like Baba O'Riley, Bargain, and Won't Get Fooled Again? These tracks alone are worth the price of the album. However, the majority of the rest is unmemorable. It is an essential British Invasion piece nonetheless."
2,Ever wonder why not everything recorded is released?,"This CD explains it all. Just because something made it to tape doesn't mean it's worth the time or our money to buy. As much as I like The Who, this CD is a big disappointment. Apparently they've learned something from Jimi Hendrix's relatives who continue to release mediocre performances and claim they're just-discovered gems. Buy the original Who's Next and forget all the extra [stuff], and save some money too."
5,"Well, you haven't heard rock until you've heard this...","pure, but decorative hard rock at its best. I was initially skeptical about the Who when I heard some old best of thing of theirs, but when I got this cd, it blew my mind how well they arranged their music. Not a weak moment on the cd, and almost 20 tracks, some newly added. I would say this is a desert Island disc, a defining document of one of the most exciting rock bands of the 60's and 70's. Start here, but by no means is this comprehensive career overview. Just get this, Tommy, Quadrophenia, and live at leeds (although I opted for Live at the Isle of Wight because it was cheaper and had the same songs. I highly recommend that one instead, because it is a very high energy performance) also get one of their single disc Best Of cd's which have stuff from their first several albums ( something like Who's Better, Who's Best). stop listening to me, get it and be astounded and led into a journey of discovery of the Who!"
5,One of the top 5 rock albums of all time (IMHO)......,"This is one of those rare rock albums that represents the peak in a great band's career. If I could only keep 5 CD's from my collection (not including any Led Zeppelin) this would be one of them. My favorite song from the album, ""Getting In Tune"", represents Daltrey's voice at it's best, and John Entwistle's bass playing puts it over the top!If you don't own this album, don't even bother debating whether to buy it..."
5,Why don't you own this yet?,"Who's Next is one of the best albums ever recorded. Hands down. The Who had many great moments (Quadrophenia) but none of them had the sheer power of this collection of songs. From the famous 'Baba O'Rily' to the haunting 'Behind Blue Eyes' to the grandiose arena rock of 'Won't Get Fooled Again' to the gorgeous 'The Song is Over', the Who are at the top of their game. The bonus tracks on this reissue are also a nice addition. This album should be in every rock fan's collection without exception.ESSENTIAL"
5,A Classic...no argument,"I too wonder what is up when an album like this gets a one star review with a totally pointless text to support it.This is without question one of the finest, possibly the finest album the Who produced. If you are a collector of great rock albums and do not have this album in your collection, well, allow me to point out a major gap. You will find the production and engineering on this SACD to be particularly fine. I would like to note that the SACD version of Tommy is also a must have."
5,Awesome,My favorite Who album !! This is a timeless classic.There is not a bad song on the album.Love It !
5,A MUST,"THe Who Are Sounding Great on this one.Won't Get Fooled Again,Baba O'Riley Are Solid to this Day.Great Musicianship&Tight Production.The Who are in Peak Form here from start to finish.this is the kind of ALbum that is Timeless.A High so High it's Hard To Recapture The Moment Again."
5,Who classic,"The only real objection I have with this CD is that ""Love Ain't For Keeping"" is 2:10. That is one of my all time favorite songs- think you could have beefed it up a little? Other then that, I like everything they added. Who's Next is really just a greatest hits album in disguise."
4,CD WORTH IT,"This CD has a few great songs. Why isn't it considered hard rock?Check out classics like Baba O Riley, Bargain, and Won't Get Fooled Again."
5,None Better,I recently listened to this album for the first time in a number of years after having worn out at least two previous ones back in the seventies. This is simply the best rock and roll album ever produced and The Who is the greatest rock band ever. Only the Beatles' Abbey Road album and U2's Joshua Tree should be considered as possible contenders.
5,World's greatest rock and roll band,"Fifty year love affair. I was in grade school the first time I saw The Who; it was on the Ed Sullivan Show. After that every time they released a new album it became a part of my cherished vinyl collection. Sadly, it was destroyed along with many other old friends by a vindictive ex-wife. It was time to be re-united.Long Live Rock"
5,Must have for any Who fan-,"Even if you are just a casual listener of the Who, this will not disappoint. There aren't any track skippers on this one-"
3,Original vinyl tunes are great; additions not,I was just looking for a good CD version of the vinyl original. I guess I got that. The additions don't grab me.Sound quality seems good.
5,one of the all time greatest albums.....,"This is just a great rock album. Every song is great.The Who are at their peak in the studio. Each artist is at their best. The layering of instruments is creative and makes for a unique sound. Piano, synthesizer (first time it was ever used), guitar, bass, drums, organ, violin, and vocals.Opening with the revolutionary Baba O'Riley, to the 7 bonus tracks, this is one cd well worth your money."
5,Bitchin'!!!!!!,"This has been one of my favorite albums since the 1970's... it was and still is a pinnacle of unfettered musical talent and energy, from the fantastic lyrical and guitar skills of Pete Townshend to the explosive drumming of Keith Moon. Not to mention the booming vocals of Roger Daltrey (great shriek in Won't Get Fooled Again) and the unfailing bass of John Entwistle. Does this sound like a paid advertisement? Well, it ain't! This is one outstanding album! Try it, you'll like it!"
5,The Who at its best,Im only 15 and my dad got me into The Who. This is the first cd of The Who I got and it convinced me strongly to go buy the others. All the songs are classic and amazing. If you want to know what The Who is about get Who's next
5,The Alpha and Omega of all Rock Albums,Got this album in high school and still have it. Not only the best Who album but the best Rock album of all time. Every song is great!
1,What the hell is this?,"Yeah swell...I finally got my new CD by The Who, ""Who's Next"". Too bad when I put the CD into my player it labeled some of the songs in Spanish and others in English. Unfortunately the names of the songs were incorrect, no matter what language it was in. This sucks! My favorite album and I finally replaced it and it turns out to be not what I ordered. Thanks."

1,Amazon downloads to much trouble,Recently I tried to purchase an album from the MP3 downloads. The album did not download and automatically sent it to a cloud that I never set up or requested. After calling the second person I spoke with was very difficult to understand and I had to ask her to speak more slowly. The entire experience took 40 minutes to download 1 album. Amazon should simplify this process if they expect repeat business from me.
3,Mediocre.,"The singer's average, the guitar player's average, the songs (""teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland"") are below average. This group is amazingly overrated. Playing at Woodstock would have made anyone immortal. (I almost fell asleep watching these guys live in Austin in 1980, too.)"
2,The Who's Only Good Album!,"Nope, The Who sucks!! This is their only good CD. Won't GetFooled Again would rank their best song of all time."
2,"townsend sucks,,,mark knopfler is the guitar god!!","certainly i dont agree with the 4 5 star reviewers below me.the who were a really overrated rock band and only could make 2 good songs like Wont get fooled again (one of the very best songs ever) and Baba riley. i didnt really like this album and they didnt make very decent music at all. Roger can't sing at all and pete townsend was a pretty bad guitar player and keith moon isnt all that great. behind pink eyes which is amongst the lousiest songs ever written is the most horrible trash tune and could match similar songs like bohemian wrhapsody,free bird,and satisfaction. i rather listen to mark knopfler insted.he is much,much,much,much,much better.get any of his albums insted..he rocked not townshend.ps. take the word for it kids.bluh!!"
3,Merely okay.,"This isn't bad, but the Living Language Ultimate Russian Basic/Intermediate course is quite a bit better for about the same price.The living language series is also coming out with CD editions, which makes it much easier to convert them to MP3 and study your language while walking, etc. Cassettes are a pain, difficult to access tracks and they wear out, too. Another plus with the living language ultimate Russian course is that there's an advanced course, should you decide to continue your study.This just isn't worth it."
3,You need to know some basics first,"These tapes and books will help you if you already have some knowledge of the language, as it goes right into conversation. But I was lost, forever lost in a world of unfamiliar letters, unusual sentence structure and words that incorporate the prepositions."
2,Disapointing ending!,"I have loved .Hack//Legend of the Twilight books, till I got to the thrid book. I was very disapointed in this book, I mean, it was a very weak story line, and it just wasn't very exciting as first two volumes. I think that Tatsuya Hamazaki should have made this manga into two, because it is a very big manga. And I lost and confused in the manga too!-Chibi"
3,Good for Manga Newbies,"This was the first manga series I ever bought. While it's certainly not on par with the likes of say, Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura, this is not a bad place to start if you're looking to get into manga. So yeah, if you've never read manga before, think of this series as a starter's kit. But for more seasoned manga fans, this series feels kinda flat, and you can do better :p"
4,Airborne,"I am finally able to review the movie since, I was just able to watch the movie. It came right on time and packaging was perfect.To say the least, I was surprised when the movie started skipping at the very end and then reset. So, I wasn't able to watch the end. But it was good to see an old film that hasn't been around for a while"
5,What a great movie.,"I remember watching this movie when I was young on VHS. As I grew up I became a huge fan of Jack Black and Seth Green only to find out they are both in this movie. I started looking for this movie on DVD years ago and for the life of me couldn't find it. I did, however, find it on DVD in German or something. Finally I found an American version and snatched it up instantly and haven't had a single regret. This is a wonderful movie, maybe corny but well acted, funny and a childhood favorite of mine. I strongly recommend to anyone."
4,Classic 90s roller blade version of karate kid,This movie is actually pretty great. One notable thing is first timer roles for Jack Black and Seth Green. Pete Sampras is also twins in this movie.
3,Better When I First Saw It,I enjoyed this movie much more the first time I saw it. It is a fine film.
5,top five,"This Is one of my all time favorite movies. no joke. it's awesome, there are some real life lessons and it''s also awesome to see seth green and jack black in their prime. I recommend this movie to everyone."
5,absolutely hilarious,"This movie is not a comedy, but it is hilarious. This will be a cult classic, well probably not, but it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, no joke!"
4,"Wow, I can't believe I enjoyed this.","I tend to think of myself as a somewhat harsh critic of movies. If I don't like it or if I didn't really find it entertaining, I'll be the first to say something. Makes my wife mad as she seems to be able to enjoy a bad movie. Airborne surprised me. I really enjoyed the movie. Yeah, it was cheesy and all works out in the end, but like the movie Angus, it made me feel good after watching it. The cast is great too. You should check this out if you have the chance."
4,Its good,Its a great movie but it will only play in dvd players- So no xbox or playstations which sucks. Other than that it is a good movie
1,Complete disappointment,"Completely ridiculous. I bought this on an 8 DVD nostalgia buying spree. Eight DVDs - this is the only one still coded in the ancient anti-piracy ""won't play if you own a DVR"".Every PC these days has a DVR - this is an obsolete business model. Will be asking for my money back."
4,Excellent movie that will bring back memories.,I have been waiting for sometime for this to come out on DVD. Then I waited longer for the price reduction. This movie brings back a lot of memories from my younger years when roller blades were the must have thing. Me and 5 other friends on my street got roller blades after seeing this movie. The story itself is very good and if you like roller blading you'll love the action scene's. I rated it a 4 star because it does have that cheesy 90's movie feel but I would give it a 5 as a former roller blade fan.
1,NOT IN ENGLISH,There are many warnings stating you need a certain type of dvd player but none saying its in DEUTSCH! If you get the dvd make certain its the English copy if they have one!
1,"Wow, that sucked!","I gave this movie 1 star, because there wasn't a lower rating. I was excited about it, after learning a young Seth Green and Jack Black were in it. The movie is horrible! If you are having trouble sleeping at night, just watch this piece of crap and you'll never want to wake up again. The movie is mainly about the very short lived roller blade fad of the early 1990's, let's just say this, surfing is always was and always will be super cool! Skateboarding is always was and always will be super cool! Rollerblading is to masculinity, what Chaz Bono is to femininity....do the math avoid this horrible movie!!!!!!"
5,very cool,"I thought this movie rocked. This is a story about a californian, roller blader, and a all around cool guy. His roller blading techniques rocks.Mitchell Goosen charmed the ladies and impressed the guy(kinda). This movie deserves a two thumbs up . It's the type of movie that can't be played out!"
1,Awesome movie... if you speak German,"I was really excited when a copy of Airborne was available, however there is no option for English, it is only in German. Bewarned not to waste your money on a movie you will not understand."
2,The only soundtrack is GERMAN,"This is a movie I like a lot, but I am giving this version only 2 stars as a warning to other customers. Look closely at the details of the movie, under Language it only mentions German. Other Region 2 movies I have purchased that are American movies have always included an English soundtrack, but not this one. You can only watch the movie with German voices dubbed over the regular voices. It doesn't even have English subtitles. I still gave it 2 stars because you don't have to speak German to enjoy the exciting Rollerblade race at the end of the movie."
2,"1990's teen romance, PASS!","Okay Jack Blacks second film, and even Seth Green couldn't save this cheese. Predictable, un-original, un-inspired plot, sloppy safe directing, average acting. This movie has a bit tiny nostalga to it as it does document the early 1990's well, but overall PASS. Better things could be spnt with your time, go fly a kite or something."
2,bootleg,After purchasing the dvd I received it. I did not read that it was a DVD-R. Oh well. I am able to watch the movie. Not happy with having a copy. A bootleg is a bootleg. I could have recorded it off tv for free and saved fifteen bucks.
4,A rare find--but needs editing,"There aren't enough Quality Management review books out there for medical/radiological imaging. Despite its rarity, this book has several errors. You will notice them when you attempt to match up your quiz answers to the answer key in the back of the book. Nonetheless, it is STILL helpful in preparing for the ARRT QM Exam. This book covers much of the material on the exam. Do yourself a favor--DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE ARRT QUALITY MANAGMENT EXAM IF YOU HAVE NOT THOROUGHLY READ ""QUALITY MANAGEMENT IN THE IMAGING SCIENCES"" by Jeffrey Papp."
2,Overpriced,"I have not read this book but I can't believe that a book that is already almost 10 years old could be worth $1325.00 The original price for the book was $57.00. So much has happened with CR and DR that I would want newer material. I know there are not review books out there but if you follow the content specifications from the ARRT, Bushong's Radiologic Science book and Papp's Quality Management in Imaging book, you can create your own review. Plus, the previous review states that it need's editing so how accurate can it be. If you contact the ARRT, and tell them you are planning on taking the QM exam, they will send you a list of reference materials and books for free. Since the ARRT is the one making up the QM exam, I would trust their reference materials the most."
5,This is one of the best shipments of rosemary,"I would not yet call this easy to grow. After planting in well cultivated garden, we had a monsoon. out of three beautiful plants, I have one that looks happy and healthy (earlier shipment). One of the help articles mentioned too much water. Down here in south Texas, too much water is not the norm. I have my newest Hirt shipment sitting on the dining room table until they get over being shipped and curlicued from the box, that is happening rather quickly."
4,"Great ""insiders"" story but quick ending","This was a really good story told from someone's viewpoint other than a military officer. It was told from the viewpoint of a reporter sent to a carrier to investigate women F-18 pilots and how they are doing in the military. Great idea! The story moved along swiftly with just enough detail, however I felt the ending was wrapped up a little too quickly (like in 3 pages!) No other complaints other than that. I will start reading his next book asap!...Dave"
4,No end in sight.,"One of the best 'page turners' I've read. The author has you immersed in the story before you know it. The story line is good, the plot is believable (for the most part), and the action is non-stop. However, you're left with an ending that is inadequate, at best. I don't understand why someone would go to such lengths to develop a plot, and then leave the reader wondering 'what happened ?'."
5,Excellent view of Naval Aviation and 'flying off the deck'.,"Campbell, Brown, Clancey...now Bob Norris. For those of you interested in aviation, flying, the integration of women in military aviation, and just a darn good read, this book is for you. The characters were well developed, the story line excellent, and I had trouble putting it down! Anyone who has read books by the previous authors should add Bob's name to their list. I hope that he continues writing from his experiences. I wouldn't even mind a non-fiction work that shows what really happened to those who were implicated, yet innocent in the Tailhook scandal. There were hints of a story even there. Good luck Bob, I'll be looking for more titles!"
5,Fabulous page-turner,Excellent action novel--best thing I've read all year. You won't be able to put it down!
1,Illegible edition,"The story is magnificent, but this edition is extremely flawed. The font is a fairly large and somewhat choppy sans-serif that is not easy on the eyes, (the I and l characters seem darker than the rest, almost a strobe effect). In the first chapter alone there are nearly a dozen inversions of letters and other typographical errors. Absolutely read The Bride of Lammermoor, but buy a different printing.The Oxford edition is very clear and legible, a much better choice!"
4,Indispensible edition of a flawed classic,"Scott's venture into the gothic genre is problematic, but Bride of Lammermoor is strikingly effective in creating suspense and unease within the framework of a crucial period in Scottish history. The Edinburgh edition's return of the novel to its original pre-Union setting casts fascinating new light on Scott's intentions."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I was pleased to find Scott's classic novel offered on Amazon.com at such a reasonable price. I was directing a production of the opera Lucia di Lammermoor, which is based on this work and wanted to read the original. As with any of Walter Scott's works, one must get used to reading his unusual spellings of Scots dialect. I was rather disappointed, however, at the number of obvious typograhical errors in this edition. ""The"" spelled ""teh"" or ""and"" spelled ""adn"" can happen occasionally, but in this printing they were endemic. That said, it contained the complete text, even if it was not particularly well laid out. As a reference copy in which I felt comfortable writing notes in the margins and underlining sections in yellow marker, this was a good buy. If you want a copy of Walter Scott's wondeful novel to keep in your library, perhaps another printing would be better."
3,The Bride Of Lammermoor,This was an interesting but very sad book. I am interested in stories about the Scottish people which was my reason for selecting this book. I kept hoping things would change for the young couple and was very disappointed in the ending.
1,This edition is full of typographical errors.,"The Bride of Lammermoor, which I purchased from Amazon.com, is full of typographical errors -- about one on every page. It's impossible to read. Also, it's set in Helvetica or some other sans serif typeface, which is also hard to read. I'd be embarrassed to sell an inferior product like this."
1,"awful, insult","To have the fauvorite book of Queen Victoria red by a computer with a clear non human voice, is an insult!"
2,Predictable...,"This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability. It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between. There are very few ""plot twists,"" and those which do occur are far from surprising. From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly. This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable. The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plot"
4,Celtic Pop Rock For The Whole Family,"Did you ever hear a song on tv show, children's movie or somewhere and you thought, 'Hey, that's a pretty good tune for a tv show...'. Well that's what this cd is like.Not quite a guilty pleasure, since Ronnie Hunter obviously has real talent, the accordion adorned, easygoing pop rock sound makes history fun. He was also with a celtic rock band called Cutty Sark."
2,Not One of His Best,There's a reason why Love-at-Arms is not counted among Sabatini's best works--this is not a very good book. It's turgid and at times boring. I gave up on it about a third of the way in.
4,Historical adventure novel,"Sabatini created another strong male hero in Francesco, the Count of Aquila, and a bold, headstrong female heroine in Valentina. In fact, the heroine is so headstrong that she successfully thwarts her uncle's plan to marry her off for a political alliance. I enjoyed this historical adventure novel, but there were a few parts that were a bit melodramatic. Nonetheless, it was an entertaining read with some enjoyable characters. It's not as strong as Captain Blood or Scaramouche, but I liked it."
2,Almost a self-parody,"I've tried to read this early Sabatini novel twice, but couldn't tolerate it. Sabatini is always perilously close to a parody of pompous pseudo-archaic style, but his charm is that he usually avoids it, even in his earlier works. In _Love-at-Arms_, however, he seems to be trying to be over the top; I'm afraid I had to give up at ""But when presently he came nearer and looked with more intentness"" in chapter five."
3,Meandering with moments of interest.,"""John Lennon and the FBI Files"" suggests that Lennon's assassin was not a deranged fan, but a programmed killer. Despite being this being the main objective of the book, it only occupies the latter third of the book's content. The majority of the book outlines the history of the CIA and FBI organizations and the various theories about mind control and programmed killers as pertaining to the Kennedy and Martin Luther King assassinations.By comparing Lennon's murder to the murder's of JFK and MLK it only exposes the lack of tangible evidence. While there's much evidence to help fuel the conspiracy theories of those assassinations, there's not a great deal of evidence in the Lennon shooting. The authors make a rather thin case in this book for a conspiracy. It's an interesting idea, but the most interesting portion of this book is dealing with the history of the CIA, which is better discussed in other books."
5,Healing The Earth,"Another good lesson. Wisdom creates Knowlege which leads to Understanding which can create the awareness that is needed to survive on a planetary scale. This is an awesome read to share with as many people as possible. Creates a good ""thinking space"".Rates right up there with ""Mother Earth Spirituality"" but leads one into deeper thought and awareness."
3,Average,"I like this book, but I think the title is a bit misleading. I was expecting a book on more traditional views, but what really came across was that this book is a soap-box for the author's stance on the environment (more or less). I completely agree with his points and still recommend the book highly, but if you're looking for a book that will teach you about the Nature Path, this really isn't it."
5,good read,"As with most of McGaas' books, this is a good read and worth the time. He is an enjoyable author and a good writer."
4,"Insightful in Native American Attitudes, Philosophy & Traditions",This book was very eye opening about the way Native Americans have been treated by 'dominant society' in the past and the lingering attitudes engendered. I also learned a lot about their traditions and philosophy. It was truly a fascinating read. I gained a greater respect for Native Americans through this short book. Definitely recommend.
4,Publisher Weekly's childish review,"This book is a fine work. Obviously, publisher weekly's reviewer must be one of those individuals (without much of a life experience) that cannot stand the recent successes of our military in Iraq and elsewhere. Shameful.More and possibly better work will follow, but for those who need a preliminary record of the iraqi battle, this book will do just that."
3,good basic trance/techno,This has some popular trance songs that you will recognize. Some of the songs you may not. This is a good trance C.D. to have in your collection.
5,Great CD! Bring on Volume 2,"While this is not officially King Crimson, it's definitely a must for any Crimson fan. This is even a great jazz CD for those who aren't (yet) fans of KC. I really enjoy the very melodic fretless bass guitar. I definitely hope they stay together and record a Volume 2. I'd love to hear some more arrangements from the '80s Fripp/Belew/Bruford/Levin line up as well as the '90s Double Trio."
4,The Complete Guide to the Music of David Bowie,"A CD-sized book detailing David Bowie's official albums, from ""David Bowie"" (1967) to ""1.Outside"" (1995), as well as compilations and sountracks. It features a detailed song-by-song analysis. A good reference for the Bowie aficionado."
2,"Horribly biased, not worth paying money for","I picked this up at a used book store for a couple of bucks and frankly it isn't worth more than that. It has some nice photographs and bits of trivia but other than that it is simply a collection of Buckley's horribly biased opinions on each of Bowie's songs. Here's what he has to say about a track from Tin Machine II:""This is pretty dull. Bowie and Gabriels try to be understated and wistful, but the song isn't up to it.""And that's ALL it has to say about it. If you want a book that really looks in-depth into the songs and albums and gives you an unbiased perspective on the history of the songs, go to Nicholas Pegg's encyclopedia. This book tries to be comprehensive and witty, but the author isn't up to it."
5,Fantastic,"Incredible performances by one of the best drummers of all time.Quite possibly the greatest Blakey recorded performance of ""Now's the Time"". Get it if you can find it. Rare, but a must have."
4,Very talented writer,"Europian crime novels are different kettle of fish. Those of us who read only American mysteries and thrillers are bound to be confused. Carlo Lucarelli is a very good example of contemporary crime writing in Europe. "" Almost Blue"" is a short, graphic book with dark characters and the solution that doesn't neatly wrap up every detail. It feels like a swift gust of violent wind, that surprises and terrifies you, and moves on in it's own twisted world. Great introduction to a very talented Italian writer."
2,"Simone is definitely blue, but the story is green.","The basic story is not remarkable. Young cop Grazia Negro is pursuing a serial killer of university students in Bologna. The male cops undersestimate her, and the bodies are piling up. What is remarkable about ""Almost Blue"" is that center of the story is Simone, a young blind man who navigates the world by smell and characterizes his experiences according to colors he has never seen. Green voices are bad. Blue voices are good. Simone spends his time in his room listening to the world on his scanners with jazz playing in the background. One night, Simone hears the ""green"" voice of a man who is a serial killer. Grazia finds her way to Simone and enlists his help in finding the killer. What happens after that is disappointing, not to say bizarre, from the perspective of crime fiction, but Simone is so interesting that he almost makes the book worth reading."
5,buy this album,my favorite abakus production and i have them all to date. great variety of soundscapes. creative in so many ways. one of my favorite albums for sure and i dont say that lightly.
4,csx,love the fact that it has real working lights...however it didnt hhok up to the cheaper train cars that I have from bachmann....A FINE ENGINE>>> Very heavy!!!
1,"Old time country, not worht the listenen","Its isnt a good one, Come on Clint you can do better than that, LIKE THE RAIN"
1,"Two Books, Same Content, Other One Is Better","These authors have also written a book titled ""Seven Methods For Transforming Corporate Data Into Business Intelligence"". The two books (""Intelligent Decision Support"" and ""Seven Methods"") are virtually identical. They have the same content, the same graphics, the same layout, the same case studies. The basic content (first 202 of 250 pages) is word for word, page for page IDENTICAL. The ONLY diffference between the 2 books is that ""Seven Methods"" includes suggested solutions for the case studies (adding about 1 page for each of the 7 case studies. If this book (""Intelligent Decision Support Methods"") appears to be of interest, buy ""Seven Methods For Transforming Corporate Data Into Business Intelligence"" instead. Do NOT buy ""Intelligent Decision Support Methods"". It is twice as expensive with no benefit."
3,Great while it lasted,"This bag only lasted two seasons for me. The zipper burst at the base and I returned from my last trip with duct tape wrapped around the bag to keep it closed.It was great while it lasted - loads of space and I generally packed everything in it for the entire trip - no other bags required. Still, feel it should have lasted a bit longer. Aside from the zipper the bag was in near mint condition."
1,Did not work for me,"maybe it was the version, but this did not work on the graffiti that was on my glass window... The graffiti might be acid type ink..."
5,Brilliant !!,"At the risk of sounding repetitive, I couldn't wait to read this book after reading Souvenir Countess. Lady Elizabeth and James Dinsmore seemed such a ""tempting"" couple. And I wasn't disappointed. The characters are well portrayed, the love story moving and poignant and the setting of revolutionary France was really well brought out. It is so refreshing when an author has researched the background.I read this book twice over and I'm sure will do so again.For those merely looking for sexual escapades, I woulnd't recommend this book. There is only one detailed sex scene (apart from the initial one in Chapter 2 where James knowingly ruins Elizabeth's reputation. HOwever, the depth of feeling between the two throughout the story is very moving.I can't wait to meet them again in Ms Novin's next book."
5,"These are great, interesting, multidimentional characters!","I really enjoyed JN's first novel, and looked forward to the second. In my opinion, she presents characters which are even more fully developed and real. Her story telling is still grand, her pacing perfect, her ability to make you believe you can hear/see/feel the place is uncanny. Now her characters are flawed, motivated, dimentional and entirely beliveable.I hope there is a third book....This is a great world she has created with myriad characters, broad histories, and events that keep building. There are so many directions she can go, so many interesting characters on which to focus. I can't wait for the next one! I want more!Go JN!"
4,Well made but shorter than pictured,"The photo for this product shows what looks to be a 2-3 year old boy and the table coming up to his hip-level; my son is 14 months old and it hits at the same level on him! He is tall for his age but still, I think the picture is misleading. It is otherwise a very cute and well-made play table. It doesn't slide and scoot around on our wood floors, the legs are heavy and sturdy and there are rubber bottoms on the legs. I think the weight is just right. It stays put for play but isn't difficult for mom to lift and move out of the way. I like the vehicles on the toy, they're utility vans and trucks of different kinds not just cars so kids will like that as they get older and understand what kind of truck is what. And in that regard I think my son will enjoy it better when he's older. I got it for him as he's learning to cruise and walk, to help him, but it doesn't hold his interest all that long yet."
3,BOOK OF ITS TIME,"When John Myers Myers wrote this book not much was publicly available and/or known about Doc. Hence, his book, like Pat Jahns, was more about the place and time than the man. Jahns at least admitted it in her title with (FRONTIER WORLD OF ETC.). Both wrote 98% about the World of Doc and 2% about Doc from necessity. Myers is better in his Tombstone Last Chance book and did some creditable research. Jahns was the first to find Doc's family and interview members and also find Frank Waters Unpublished Ms. on Aunt Allie Earp in the Arizona Historical Society. (Of course she had no way of knowing that was half spurious.) John Myers Myers, however, had a great feel for the time and place and understood ""Gunfigher Psychology.""Good read in any case. It should be in the ""Compleat Western Buff's Bookshelf."" Product of its times."
3,goes on and on,This book is a good read if you can sit down and keep your mind on it. The author uses in my opinion too many words to get the point across and loses you. This book is not easy to read. If you are a hardcore Doc fan this is the one for you. Not personal just the facts.
3,Good Book,The only reason why I am giving this book 3 stars is because it was a little hard to follow. My son was doing a report on Doc Holliday and wanted this book. He finally gave up and did his report on someone else.
2,Buy Wyatt Earp: The Life Behind the Legend,"While this book does contain some facts, all of those facts and more are set out much more clearly, intelligently and properly researched in The Life Behind the Legend. Myers takes some historical information, a lot of creative thinking, mixes it with some general western myths and serves up ""Doc Holliday"". Some is entertaining, but it left me wanting a real read, especially after having read other better documented information on Doc's life. While his bibliography is long he failed to dig into the historical documents of the era and reiterates a lot of myths that have been exploded by 2002."
3,Not as Shown,"This product was shown as a yellow and green John Deere Bird Feeder. It arrived in good shape and on time for Mother's Day, but it is all green and did not have the John Deere name on it."
4,honor thy farther,"if the government wants you, there is know place to hide. the book is about Bill Bannono son of joe Bannono. His life inside the mafia, and what the government will do to make sure it comes to an end. I found the book alittle drawn out, but Talese as in all his books goes in to great detail."
5,buying & selling a restaurant business,"Very useful information. This book brought up a lot of insightful points, we had not considered."
4,For Mountain Fans,"I purchased this cd for the express purpose of hearing ""Dreams of Milk & Honey/Dream Sequence."" It wasn't bad, but the ""Flowers of Evil"" version is much better. Like the other reviewers, I saw the original line-up three times. Mountain live was awesome. If they opened for a more prominent act, I would have hated to go on after them. ""Nantucket Sleighride"" has been performed better on other cds. However, ""Mississippi Queen"" and ""Silverpaper"" are extended versions and are quite excellent. At their best, Mountain was always a guitar fueled, jam band. This cd, while quite good, should not be one's introduction to Mountain. As for Steve Knight, I read somewhere, that he and the other band members did not get along well. Thus you rarely hear of him and his contributions to the band. I agree ""PLAY THIS MUSIC LOUD."""
5,To My Children's Children,"Excellent read. A personal, in-depth view of a young woman's struggle to rise above her circumstances in South Africa's era of apartheid.Very moving and engaging."
4,My sister used it once in a bind. It was worth the cost,i have no buyer's remorse in this product because my sister used this when she had some car troubles and it worked.
1,"Shining Through, Music",The movie was great. The sound track CD was terrible. I was very disapointed. The film had some good Big Band numbers in it that wereleft off the CD. The Big Band music set the mood of the 1940s and thewar years.
3,"Best adaptation of Stoker's classic, so far","This is the best adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel to date, starring the best Dracula-player in the business, Christopher Lee. No one captures the essence of Stoker's Count like Lee does. Though there has never been a truly faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel to the big screen, this is the closest thing. The film follows the novel pretty well, until the end, which differs greatly from the novel. This is one to add to any Dracula collection."
3,jess Franco's count Dracula,Sadly this movie wasn't what I except even if it did come out in the seventy but so did Dan Curtis Dracula the one that start Jack plance and is way better then this version heck Christopher. Lee's other Dracula films are 10 times better they say the wanted to stick to the novel but it dose'nt. If. You read the novel you know what I mean I won't spoil for you but you're going to be disappointed. If your. A die hard fan of Lee horror movies. But it OK to get for the price or just to say I have all his vampire. Movies
2,Faithful? Ha!,"The only people who would think this was faithful to the book, haven't read it. I guess it's just so dull people assume the book must be like that or they wouldn't make the movie. The scene where a bunch of stuffed animals start to quiver to life is hilarious."
2,Jess Franco's Count Dracula,Atmospheric as promised. Christopher Lee is great as Dracula. It's theworst dubbing I've ever seen. If they're going to the trouble of puttingthis on DVD with a great build-up the least they could is re-dub it. Ifyou are considering buying this I'd say rent it instead.
2,Snooooooorrrrrrrrrzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"THIS is Chris Lee's favorite version of the Count?! C'mon! It's slow, ponderous, and boring. Watching blood clot is more exciting. The author further fails in his leap of faith that everyone just knows the Dracula mythos and is familiar with Stoker's novel, by creating scenes and dialog that make no sense without the background knowledge. Bela and Todd, you're still the classic best, and this version doesn't even fly close."
2,For Lee/Dracula Completists Only,"Jess Franco has to be one of the worst directors out there. He's managed to take a great story, hire a terrific cast, set them in interesting locations and still make a mess of the film.He uses a zoom lense at every opportunity, his day for night photography is a joke and the whole thing moves at a snail like pace.The only reason to have this movie is if you are a Christopher Lee or Bram Stoker fan and even then only as an interesting curiosity.The one thing it has going for it is the fact that there are more of Stokers actual dialogue spoken in this than any other Dracula film."
5,Thanks Christopher Lee For Returning To Dracula Dispite Not Wanting To Play The Role Again,"Christopher Lee (HORROR OF DRACULA, THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN), Herbert Lom (LADYKILLERS, Stephen King's THE DEAD ZONE) and Klaus Kinski (NOSFERATU: THE VAMPYRE) star in this stylistique version of Stoker's tale. I have not finished it but I plan to soon, so far so good! Have no rating yet."
2,Lethargic adaptation of Dracula...,"This is certainly one of the worst adaptations I've ever seen. We have 3 distinguised actors, Lee, Lom and Kinski, in a dull version of Stokers book. The dialogue and pacing are awful, the effects, laughable and the talents of the actors are under-used (especially that of Kinski, as a mute Renfield.)I have never been a fan of cheesy horrors or Hammer. This isn't Hammer, but definately feels like it. The sets are as always glorious as are the costumes, but there is little else to reccomend this film."
5,mad tv > snl,I wish amazon instant video had all the seasons of mad tv it was so underrated. While im here maybe we can get the star wars collection to.
2,just a copy of the original home alone 2 soundtrack.,"Before I begin let me say that I am the biggest fan of Home Alone 2:Lost In New York. Last week I visited New York City, largely because of this film. Due to my love for it, I, of cours e own the soundtrack, the score, and this album. I strongly reccomned the other two albums, but not this one. Let me explain. This album was released in 1993, one year after Home Alone 2 was released. I guess the film-makers wanted to make even more profit off of the franchise that already made so much money in the first place. All the songs on Home Alone:Christmas, with the exception of one or two are already on the Home Alone 2 soundtrack!! This is basically the same album with a different title-the only other difference is that it contains some songs from the first Home Alone soundtrack, which I also have, and reccomend.So if you want a few good Christmas albums, or want all the Home Alone CD's, get the other three-only purchase this to complete your set."
4,A Christmas album everyone will enjoy!,"""Home Alone Christams"" is a great album and features all of the songs from the movies: Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. It doesnt feature the background music just the original songs from other artists but it does feature John Williams.Most of the songs are good but ""Sleigh Ride"" by TLC was not one of the best and that is probably why I gave it 4 stars. Another reason was that some of the songs I don't remember hearing in either of the movies but the songs are still great! My favorite song is ""All Alone on Christmas"" by Darlene Love and some of my other favorites include ""Somewhere in my memory"",""A holy jolly Christmas"" and ""Christmas all over again"" by John Williams, Alan Jackson and Tom Petty with the Heartbreakers. But all songs are mostly good.If you loved both of the movies and are looking for a good Christmas album then get this is the album for you!"
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this CD since it didn't have the White Christmas number on it. This was my favorite song.Other songs were from both movies
2,Not my taste!,"Someone recommended I listen to this CD for ideas for a Christmas show I was producing and directing. It wasn't what I was looking for. It's more my husband's kind of music. It was used and cheap; the plastic case was broken as I was forewarned, BUT the CD itself was in very good condition."
2,enjoyed but.....,"I ordered both Home Alone original soundtrack as well as Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York original soundtrack. I used to have both of them a few years ago and enjoyed them very much. When i got these and played them, they were exactly the same music, same songs same artists. I was so disappointed. Although the covers had the correct artist and music that should have been on the cd, both cd's were the same"
5,Best Christams song ever!-Worth it for Track 7!!!,"Other than the Tom Petty Box set ""Playback"" (which I have) this is the only other place I have seen this song. Christmas All Over Again - Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers. Best Christams song ever!"
4,Great X-Mas Soundtrack!,"For those that loved the movie, this is a great Christmas soundtrack! Lots of classics as well as some new ones (at the time)!!""Wait, honey... WHERE'S KEVIN?!!""Probably the best one of the series! So check it out..."
3,Somewhat Disappointed in the Version,"Being the greatest fan of Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2 there ever was I am somewhat disappointed in this version of the music. The volume level does not seem consistant, but mostly there is a ""soul"" version of ""Oh Come All Ye Faithful"" that does not fit in and adds *nothing* to the soundtrack of John Williams', John Hughes' and Chris Columbus' incredible work. I don't remember that rendering of the song being in either movie. Wish I could remove it."
2,"Case is ok, but it broke too soon.","I liked the case, but unfortunately it broke long ago. I have not been able to find a decent (good/cheap) protective case for my Razr. Nowadays I just carry it in my pocket"
5,Great investment,Looks better than the regular phone and protects it. Definitely more than worth the cost.
3,OK for the price,"If you're looking for the cheapest way to protect your Razr then this product is suitable. In the long run, if you're like me, you will want to purchase a case or covering that covers both the phone itself and inside and outside displays.The cover is just plastic that clips onto the phone. There is no covering for the display screens which you constantly touch and have to wipe clean. Other than that, you get what you pay for."
5,Great idea..,"This is a great little cover...it's glossy black and slides right on and over the phone. It is so glossy that it needs some of those ""e-grips"" on one side so you can grab it easier."
4,Great work!,"This was very, very good for a first novel. The mystery of what happened to Ronica, and why, was answered very well, and there were some hints that led up to the explanation that were fair to the reader. I enjoyed it very much, and I just ordered the next book in the series. I would definitely recommend it."
4,Fun reading - got me hooked on sci-fi!,"The book started off a little slow and I wasn't sure I was going to like it. However, 1/4th of the way into the book I was hooked and I can't wait until the next one comes out. The characters are interesting and likable"
2,Dreadful,"This is a dreadful book and I am sorry I bought it. There is no serious science , the story telling style (all those hints from the future) really irritated me and there were lots of plot holes hastily covered. I found the several societies unbelievable, most notably in their coexistence. The good thing about this book is that it wasn't boring so I was able to finish it, but there where several times I almost threw it out the window."
1,ugh,"What a terrible book. Unbelievable.The book starts out in a typically ok sci-fi fashion, but then the main character proceeds to become more and more hateful as each page turns. How can you like a book when the main character makes you puke?My eyes literally got sore rolling my eyes at the book. Ronica is selfish, shallow, annoying, frequently stupid, emotionally stunted, and altogether irritating. Her ""sexual revelations"" are just embarrassing to read. Fourteen-year-olds may find this book appealing, but not anyone with any life experience at all.Also, the so-called surprise twist is cheap and disappointing. You endure the entire book to find out what this big amnesia secret is, and when you do you, you couldn't care less.Basically, the entire book is like a teenager's really bad book of poetry. Save yourself some money, time, and contact embarrassment by staying away from this book.I can't believe I read the entire thing. I am stupider now. Thanks, Ms. James."
4,"Well written, readable ethnographic account of Barbados","Excellent ethnography of the the changes that have been occurring in Barbados since the arrival of Europeans and Africans. The Gmelches take students to the island for a semester every other year so they can learn how to do ethnographic research in cultural anthropology. They are placed in Bajian homes and live there for ten weeks. The book is well informed by the students' perspectives. They help us all see what this island is like and what the life of the islanders has become in the light of tourism development on the island. The Gmelches write well and the book is easy to read and very informative. I have made the book a required text in one of my university, introductory anthropology courses."
1,Snoozefest!,"This book is terribly boring, and many of the characters have similar names, making it hard to keep track of people. I get that it's not actually a story, and is based on real life events and blahblahblah, but that doesn't make it any more interesting."
4,A fine album lost in the puddle of grunge,"CONTEXT: Penn's 2nd album had no chance at commercial success; it was far too studious for rock radio. It contains the best and worst elements of Penn's craftsmanship.MUSIC: Nothing on this album is as immediadely gripping as his best work, but the songs are filled with lots of subtle hooks and interesting sounds.LYRICS: Penn comes up with some interesting phrase turns, but as a whole, the lyrics are impenetrable. Like Cobain's lyrics, there are plenty of unique images among seemingly random verses. Very ""interesting"", but not the stuff of great rock n roll.HIGHLIGHTS: Long Way Down (Look What the Cat Drug In), Slipping My Mind"
2,Careful with this one,Big Mountain fan here and have been enjoying the bootleg releases that have surfaced lately from the archives of Corky and Leslie's personal stash. I purchased this one however and I am very disappointed. It stated it was recorded Live in New Jersey in 1973. I already own the Mountain Greatest Hits Live (King Biscuit Flower Hour)which is said to be recorded the same place only a year later. The recordings on this disk are the very same as the ones on the Mountain greatest hits live disk. However The King Biscuit Flower Hour sounds better and has more songs as well. Very disappointed in this one. It should have the dates correctly stated to avoid the confusion. I certainly did not need to spend the money i forked over for this one. The music is very good but king biscuit is the better buy by far. Crossroader is also listed as a song on the bootleg version but is nowhere to be heard on the disk though.
4,"Wrong alblum reviewed above by Arthurley ""music expert"" ???","The review by 'Arthruley' above must be referring to the alblum ""Official Bootleg Series, Vol. 6: Passaic NJ Capitol Theatre '74 "" which seems to be similar to the King Biscuit Flower Hour disc. The base line in both Vol 6 and KBFH is very weak. The set list for Vol 3 has fewer songs than the other two and does not include 'Mississippi Queen'. The base line in Vol 3 is strong and overall the disc seems well recorded unlike the other two."
2,Isolated,"My review is not low because of a conservative anti-Crossan bias (not that I'm unbiased), but the book, for all its great length and detail about the cultural world of the 1c Roman empire, barely gets into the Apostles teachings and theology.Perhaps more inexcusable, is the fact that the book interacts almost not at all with any dissenting scholarly opinions, and completely ignores the most significant Pauline scholars out there.Useful perhaps to understand the culture of the time, but not helpful to understand Paul's thought. But still Wayne Meeks ""The First Urban Christians"" does a much more thorough job at this."
2,"Mediocre attempt that really is not in search of ""Paul""","Crossan and Reed here make a really poor attempt to do several things, provide a historical, sociological, anthropological, and religious context to the world of the historical Paul, while at the same time present a modern travelogue and archaelogical primer of Paul's world. But at the same time, they attempt an exegesis of Paul's writings, give themselves literary license to rewrite scripture, and try to downplay or even declare wrong whole portions of the New Testament. They obviously started the book with a clear agenda to challenge and find illegitimate non ""politically correct"" portions of the New Testament and so the title is completely misleading. While obviously everyone is entitled to their own views on scripture, this attempt at religious revisionism is absurd, especially when these authors pretend to do it under the guise of scholarship."
2,Suffered in the Execution,"Crossan and Reed deserve two stars just for the attempt to explain Paul of Tarsus with an interdisciplinary approach. Unfortunately, their worthy ambition exceeded their ability to create a cohesive analysis, and what results is an uninspiring mishmash of travelogue, history, archeology, exegesis, sociology, art history, and polemic."
1,In Search of Paul : How Jesus' Apostle Opposed Rome's Empire with God's Kingdom,The author is obviously an intellectual scholar who only knows what he believes to be true. The simple fact that he believes that Paul is the author of only seven of the 13 books tells me that he has no knowledge of the Holy Spirit in the canon of scriptures. Furthermore that the equality of mankind Paul speaks of is the equality through faith in Christ not equal rights liberalism. This writer may claim to be a Christian but has no knowledge of Christianity.
4,Seven standards shine under a paper moon,"The 1981 edition of the Dave Brubeck Quartet performs a nicely sequenced set of seven standards, highlighted by a ""Paper Moon"", creating a relaxed yet wistful mood. Pianist Dave Brubeck and tenor saxist Jerry Bergonzi take strong solos throughout. Bassist Chris Brubeck gets in a nice melodic bass solo in on the opener, ""Music, Maestro, Please!"". Chris breaks out his bass trombone for a solo on the title track, throwing in a cute ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" quote before wrapping up the track with a return to the primary melody. Drummer Randy Jones is solid in support throughout, creating subtle rhythmic interest. If you're a fan, you know what to expect from Dave, lots of block chords, though he steps out with fast single note runs in ""Long Ago (And Far Away)"", and takes a sensitive solo turn on ""St. Louis Blues"" to close out the set. Overall, another very solid entry into the maestro's lengthy discography."
4,Excellent diaper product.. the only improvement...,"I do think the tabs are great. Many of the adult diapers are pullups and you just cannot get the custom/snug fit that the tabs provide. However, I wish the tabs were designed so that it was easy to refasten. Otherwise, this diaper is great."
5,Beautiful Tone!,"Great quality, especially for the money! I purchased a set for myself, and my mother loved them so much that I decided to give a set to her for her birthday. She was delighted! As I sat on my patio one morning, I kept ""hearing"" Amazing Grace in my head, and to my delight, I figured out that it was the chime tones that was reminding me of the song. They must be tuned to the notes of that song. Very well worth the money."
2,"Sound and Look Good, Too Quiet","Pros:--The chimes sound pleasant. They're attractive, too, with dark green chimes and a pale green stain on the wood parts.Cons:--Requires a strong wind to make them sound. Unfortunately, they're rather quiet with little sustain, so it's hard to hear them over the wind unless you are quite close to them. In a good wind, I can hear distant chimes from my neighbors' yards clearly but am lucky to hear these chimes at all from twenty feet away.--Made in China"
3,Great idea; not great execution,"Same as the other volume I reviewed: the English interpreting doesn't line up with the signing, so my kids could not learn any ASL from this tape."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I suppose I should have known better given the very low price of this ring, but I was still surprised when I opened the package only to find a ring that looks like something you would get out of a gumball machine.I admit that I am no expert on jewelry, and thus it is possible I am incorrect in my displeasure, but to me the entire product, from the band to the ""opal"" (and I use the term loosely) looked like cheap plastic. I would under no circumstances recommend this product to anyone."
5,A powerful healer's jouney,"Julia, a powerful healing practitioner and Reiki master, shares her journey as a healer, along with techniques and meditations that can be used for self-healing, protection, and much more. Her book is a beautiful testament to the mysteries of the human spirit, written with love, humor, and lots of anecdotes."
5,The Real Thing,"Julia Carroll is the real thing. In her book she has a world of spiritual information to offer, whether you have already encountered the healing art of Reiki in your life or you are seeking knowledge of this ancient, tried, and true practice. The benefits are clear, as is her writing and recommendations. Reading this book makes you aware that you are encountering a Master who with joy and love seamlessly presents a path that is open to everyone. Dive in."
1,Garbage!,This purchase was my most disappointing purchase ever! It's not Sterling Silver and it's Chinese Turquoise. It's also not real leather. So it's worth about $5 and is selling for 5 times that much. I do NOT recommend this product!
4,"Elvis Presley and Christmas, how can it get any better","If you are looking to try collecting cds, that Elvis Presley is singing Christmas songs, you can start with this. If you an Elvis Presley fan, and looking for a short album, this is the cd for you. The cd runs 23 minutes and 15 secends. I know that it is not Chirstmas time, but do you really need to wait until Chirstmas to start listening to Chirstmas music? There are 10 songs, on this cd, and they are Blue Christmas, Silent Night, White Christmas, Santa Claus is Back in Town, I'll Be Home for Christmas, If Every Day Was Like Christmas, Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane), Oh Little Town of Bethlehem, Santa Bring My Baby Back (to Me), and Mama Likes the Roses. The last one (to me) doesn't seem to have anything to do with Christmas. So that is why I am giving this a 4. Also, track #8, doesn't know have much to do with Christmas, but a town. But all in all, a still good cd for Elvis Presley fans."
5,Good value,The battery is an exact replacement for my Garmin GPSMap 478. It arrived quickly and is functioning well. A good value and a lot cheaper than the OEM.
2,Only lasted nine months,"Wish I could give this a better review, but mine only lasted nine months after four uses, then died never to be revived. As described in other reviews, it did not lock when I first installed it, but I was able to bend the tab and finally get it to lock.I am about to buy a different brand to replace this one."
3,Garmin 276C replacement battery,"The price for this battery is good.The plastic molded case for the battery is poor.without finding something to wedge the battery in place the battery will disconnect from the contacts.This can be aggravating.This battery replacement is adequate, but not ideal."
1,CHINESE JUNK,"I ordered this battery to use in my Garmin GPSMAP 478. It is so poorly made that it will not stay securely positioned within the battery compartment of the Garmin unit unless you use strong tape (like duct tape or gaffer's tape) to hold it in place. Still worse, when new it would only hold a charge for about two hours. And worst of all, it stopped working entirely after only eight weeks. My advice, pay more for a genuine Garmin battery and be assured that it will fit and function as intended. Why does Amazon continue to offer junk like this for sale?"
1,Battery a Disaster!,"This battery does NOT fit the Garmin 276C properly and although does charge up, it does NOT work in the GPS and gives me false messages, battery missing, etc. and will not allow the power cord to be disconnected.....ie the GPS does NOT work on Battery power! Osprey-Talon has not responded to my complaints and I am out on a 4 month cruise where I need to use the GPS almost every day. I am very dissatisfied!SS"
1,Not a good battery,Bought this to save a few dollars and really wasted a few dollars instead. While it does fit my gps with no issues it will not charge to more than a quarter way and that took two days while using my car charger. I guess now I am forced to buy the Garmin battery. I wouldn't recommend this battery to anyone.
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this to save some money over the Garmin battery. From the day it arrived, after being fully charged, it last a maximum of 2 hours."
5,great price/great battery,Fast service. This battery fits my Garmin 276C like the original and works as well as the original. I am very pleased.
3,His first sides,"Somewhat spotty because of the inclusion of too many dreadful tunes of the day, this CD, the first on Red in the Classics series, also has two of Red's very best sides: ""It should be you"" and ""Swing out."" Just having these two recordings is worth some of the dregs that are also here."
4,cute and fun - worth the $32.00,"These bagpipes are exactly as described. I play the bagpipes and have a toddler that's very interested in them, so I bought these - for the $32 they cost, I think they will be lots of fun and we can do some ""duets"" together - a great little motivator to inspire a musical connection. They are functional (without drones) but only four stars because the valve at the bottom of the blowpipe isn't working - I'll have to fix something up for that.... but then again, they are only $32.00 so worth it."
3,This Book is not the Complete collection.,This book is his selected works.But the explanation is very everything down to the minutest details.Expensive a little.
4,some good freestyle & some classic NY dance traxx,"I bought this CD to have some of my fave traxx from Midnight Sun Records (re-christened Fourth Floor) on CD. This CD includes We Can Work It Out from Arlene (ex Leather and Lace - Tender Heart), Can't take these lies from Suzy Swan and Is it me or is it her from Midnight Fantasy featuring Nadia. I am happy to have radio edits of these 3 freestyle hits on CD; however I wish all the freestyle releases of this label were available in CD format: Come back to me + Why cry + Come a little closer/Midnight Fantasy, Who will it be/Arlene, Crimes of passion + another track/Spirit Matter. Midnight Fantasy had a number of high quality freestyle productions - what a crime that they weren't more successful!!! This CD also features a number of NY dance traxx that club-goers of the 80s are likely to recognise - good value for the price"
5,great product,"It worked exactly like I expected to, one thing that I'd of loved to be added to it though would be a bit of anti sieze. The heads on the modular engines are aluminum and the 304 stainless will weld in place if it is not used. However, for the price I am going to be doing this on all my modulars.."
5,"A good book, review by Michelle Blaz","After reading ""Wayne Estes: A Hero's Legacy"" I had learned so much from it. Even though Wayne was originally from Anaconda I did not know very much about him. Olson does an excellant job with details, there are so many, that you can almost picture yourself at the scenes in this book. Such as the basketball game, and when Wayne walked right into the live wire. I have read the book twice now and I am writing a research paper on it now in my English class. It is an magnificent reference and has a lot of information. If you haven't read this book yet I really encourage you to do so if you are interested in basketball."
4,"Engrossing and realistic, yet oddly cold and unemotional.","I found the characterization stimulating and engrossing, as well asthe subject matter. But what should come across as emotional and tenseseems exactly the opposite of that, as if the cold and calculating Ross is actually writing the story, deeply denying and burying any pretense of feeling to protect herself. If that is the authors intention, it is done well. I found it difficult to latch onto because of this."
1,Where's the Beef,Why do I have to wait 4 to 6 weeks before my book is in stock? I fear my swimming pool will be assimilated as part of the Florida Everglades by the time I get my book and figure out what to do. Please respond
4,Rolling Back Pack,I purchased this back pack for my daughter. She is in Middle school and has to carry her books with her for the whole day. This back pack is great because of the large capacity she can get all her books into it and I don't have to worry about her developing back issues later in life! It rolls well and so far has withstood the demands of my pre-teen!
1,handle broke off after 8 mos.,"Great travel pack for my daughter, neat pink color, but handle just broke off after 8 mos. of light use. What a bummer! Pack is hardly dirty. Not sure how to fix it and no name or any other info on pack to contact fabricator. Seems like a waste! You'd be best to purchase two bar handle, not this uni-handle."
1,Nursing Students Beware!,"Bought this for my wife who is a 1st year nursing student.PROS: It's a wonderful LOOKING Pack.CONS: It's cheaply made and the handle is extremely weak. After just 3 days of use, the handle broke and I had to repair it myself. Then the zipper stopped zipping. There's not enough room in this thing for all of those nursing books."
1,"bad handle quality, dont' buy","I bought this bag for my 5th grader after he went through a couple of rolling backpacks earlier, thinking that this is the one. After only 2 weeks, the handle came off when he was getting ready for school.Although the backpack looks pretty solid bag wise, the handle part does look very shaky. I remember thinking about that when I first received it. Guess my instinct was right."
1,Cheap handle breaks too easily,"My daughter has used this (expensive bag) since 2010. It started falling apart after a few months of use. The zippers break for no apparent reason. We also had a zipper separate from the material leaving a whole that I tried to patch. The latest news is that the extendable handle broke while wheeling the bag across a street. When it broke (once again, for no apparent reason [global warming maybe??]), I realized that the concealed portion of the carry handle was made of cheap plastic. This is deceptive because the outer portion appears to be made from some type of metal. Why they would make this critical part out of cheap plastic is beyond my understanding. This thing is really overpriced for the quality you get. Buy a cheaper bag so you won't get angry like I did when it starts falling apart."
4,Bookbag Review,"I am very pleased with the High Sierra backpack, especially when it came to the price. We paid about half of what it would have cost at a department store."
2,Never received product,"I purchased this product for my first semester of nursing school, however, a week after I bought it I received an e-mail from the company stating that they no longer have any in stock. I was disappointed b/c I was waiting for it to arrive. I can't recommend this since I did not receive it. I'm giving a 2 solely on the seller's actions. The refunding time was quick."
2,High Sierra OverSteer Wheeled Backpack/Book Bag,"We purchased a High Sierra Oversteer Wheeled Backpack for our son at the end of January 2008 and we have not yet reached the end of February, yet the top section of the telescoping single pole T-shaped handle has detached from the bottom, loosing any fasteners.His prior backpack lasted a year and the double pole telescoping handle only started to fail at the same time the backpack itself showed the strain of too many books packed within. This is why we ordered a larger capacity one. However, perhaps it is possible that this single pole handle is inadequate on a larger capacity, fully loaded bag. I am not sure but I believe his prior backpack may have been a Jansport."
1,Broken Handle,"Wouldnt recommend this item... For the cost the quality of the product is lacking. I travel for a living and have used many different types of bags so was interested when I saw the design. The handle broke off a month after I bought it, the problem is it broke off and left a metal wire sticking out. Try explaining that to the Airport Security when trying to get back after a business trip."
4,Not Too Bad For Low Carb Fare,"Kind of dry but the flavor was not too bad. Best made according to directions then chilled. Add beaten egg and fry as a patty in butter :) I would however not expect real potatoes, or even instant potatoes for that matter or you will be disappointed."
1,Nice paperweight,"At first, I was reasonably pleased with the item. It holds my Palm TX at a close to 90 degree angle, which makes it difficult to use while in the cradle. It still charges fine, though the power connection is loose.The problem is that it has stopped syncing. I've tried multiple USB ports and several resets, but nothing works. My TX syncs fine with a separate cable, so it is not the TX or USB port."
2,Toxic Botch Job,"Danielle Steele must be getting old. Or forgot to hire an editor. Or fired the editor she used to use. Or rushed the book to print.This book is a barely filled in outline. The characters are flat; the situations empty. Not enough time was spent filling out the characters and making them 3 dimensional; making them real. Perhaps if she took this outline, she could flesh out 3 really good books.And it's disheartening to have a woman perpetuate the idea that ""toxic bachelors"" can be ""cured"" by the right woman. Women have been banging their heads and hearts against these shallow, self-serving men throughout history, only to end up with a broken heart and damaged self-images. Please, stop perpetuating the idea that women can fix men, and encourage them to wait for the man that doesn't need fixing."
3,Fair Read,"I was a dedicated reader of Danielle Steel in her earlier years. Once I discovered her (many, many years ago), I read eveything she had written and waited anxiously for her new publications. Somewhere along the line, they all had the same plot. It seemed as if she took the outlines from prior novels and changed the names and places. Consequently, I read her work occassionally but, more often than not, don't read her work as much.After finishing Toxic Bachelors, I can say I did enjoy the story. Unfortunately, it dragged a little too much and tended to overwork a subject. It seemed that just when you thought it was all going to come together, it didn't.As another reader pointed out, in was too repetitive. Especially in the beginning, when she's setting up the characters, she kept repeating things about them and their lives. Like the other reader stated--""ok, I get it already!"".Overall, I did enjoy the story but it did tend to drag on in parts."
1,Horrible,"I couldn't get past the first few pages without reading the same sentences over and over. It was rather annoying. The last few books by Danielle Steel have been the same. I was going to pre-order her new book coming out this month, but I cancelled it because I have a feeling that book is going to be the same. I am not sure if Steel is just running out of things to write about or if she just doesn't care about her fan base anymore. She either needs to step up her game and get with the program or retire her typewriter. Get it together, Steel! You're losing your fans."
4,Enjoyable!,"I completely enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an enjoyable read. I will agree with a previous poster that at times she seemed very repetetive in some of her descriptions and I found myself jumping paragraphs because I had seriously gotten the picture, but that was mostly in the beginning. And at times the conversations didn't necessarily seem believable, but for the most part they did and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was a great read."
3,Nicely done!,"I enjoyed this novel a lot more than I thought I would. It's a solidly told story of three friends, confirmed bachelors, and the strong women who melt through their resolve. The characters really captured my heart, with their interesting backgrounds. I grew to care for them as though they were my own friends, and I particularly connected with Carole. I also appreciated the description of the yacht voyage to various Mediterranean ports - fun!!! My one criticism is that Danielle Steel tends to get quite repetitive, and there were details that were unnecessarily repeated again and again - this story could have been told as effectively in about 50-75 fewer pages."

2,Toxic reading,"I give the author credit that she changed her traditional storytelling format. This was from the male perspective. Charlie Harrington, Adam Weiss, and Gray Hawk, were good friends and dedicated bachelors. Each had their own complicated, flimsy reasons for being commitment-phobic. However Gray, the loner artist finds Sylvia; Adam the lawyer and wild bachelor finds Maggie; and Charlie, the blue-blood finds Carole. They are all stereotypical characters that we have seen in her previous novels. There is an annoying lack of attention to details and it shows when little Gabby appears with her seeing-eye dog Zorro. Charlie pets him like a household pet and not as a working dog. Conversation between the men sounds at times inane and immature. It was a struggle to finish."
1,More than a disappointment!,"I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others. For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers. I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore. She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable. Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works. This book was just awful."
1,"Boring story, inmature characters","What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped characters? The book starts as ""Sex and the city"" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and these succesful ""teenagers"" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha!Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I don't know why I keep reading Steel's books-She has become very redundant and somewhat boring in her writing. Also contradictory,amateurish-I just keep reading them because she used to be one of my favorite authors and hope that she will return to her initial type of writing. The plot is a good one but sadly lacks in details and style. The last few books I have read of hers I just have to ask myself ""why do I keep reading them?"" Try Karen Kingsbury-She is EXCELLENT."
4,Very Good!,"While I didnt find this to be her best work, this book was quite enjoyable and was a great change from that ""poor, divorced/widowed woman in distress"" story. This one goes 2 steps better by showing the male side of dating. While there are parts that can bore you to tears, this book was very good."
1,Somebody Stop Me........,"........from reading Danielle Steel. Here's the book: three bachelors meet three women. They all break up, they all end up happily ever after. BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book. I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel. My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers. THAT'S sad."
3,"Just OK, But I Listened to it Anyway","I love many of the novels of Danielle Steel, but this one is full of unlikable characters, in my opinion. The 3 men are supposed to be ""toxic"" and it's clearly obvious why. The are mean, unlikable men, with so many flaws and excess baggage that one almost pities the 3 women who end up with them. If you are a first time Danielle Steel reader or audio book listener, then I suggest you begin with some of her earlier - and much better written - novels: The Dating Game; Answered Prayers; The Wedding... these are all superior to Toxic Bachelors. However, I did listen to it all the way through and was entertained in some parts... but finally came out with the conclusion that it was ""just ok""."
4,Comeback Trail,After Miracle and Echoes I thought Danielle Steel was losing her touch. That is Until Toxic Bachelors which I have enjoy very much. The story of three men because of their past vow never too become too serious with relationships. Then life has a way of stepping in and you know the rest. If you are looking for good Danielle Steel this is it.
5,Fellowship of the Ring Newborn Lurtz Action Figure,"This figure is great! He is very durable, and comes with a nice whip. You may think the whip will just fall out of his hand,(which is what I thought when it got here)but it has a peg which you fit in a hole in the figure's hand. I would suggest putting it in and keeping it there because the peg seems like it will break if you put it in and take it out a lot. I also must note that the feet should not be counted as places you can move. They can not move very much either way. One of the best things about it is a peg in his back. If you move it right, left, up, or down his arms will go the other way. All in all it is a great toy. I'm glad I got it."
4,Newborn Lurtz,"This is basically Lurtz when he was just born(why's he so big though?)It has loads of details, and is very durable, so there's no risk of breaking it. He has 12 points of articulation(head, arms, elbows, waist, legs, knees, ankles) His action feature consists of a big knob on his back that you move about to control his arms. His proportions are good, but his pecs and abs are a little to over-sized from what you see in the movie, imo. He has a whip, which ""is"" just ""bad"". I would've like removable armour, but hey, you can't have everything. All in all, 2 thumbs up!"
4,Newborn Lurtz,"This toy is a fun toy. It has good detail in the whole body and has a six tailed whip. This toy has eleven action points, a dull red color with some black spots. It has slick black hair. The whole figure has a dull color to it but is good for the shadowy life of Lurtz. Its also good at standing so it doesn't need a stand. I recommend this toy for five years old and up.I rate this toy four stars for fun."
2,OK,"This toy is'nt that bad but it just is'nt that good to play with. My biggest problem is that it does'nt come with a decent weapon, or any armor. If you want a better one get the gimli uruk-hai two pack.This toy is ok.There's not much to do with it.Any possible leg movment is blocked by that cloth, and that arm thing is'nt useful in battle.Not that it's a bad figure it just does'nt match up to other lord of the rings toys."
5,Great product,"I used the product to cover plywood for a router table, which turned out great. I was a little skeptical about the iron-on approach but it turned out to be easy to apply, appears to adhere to the wood well with no bubbles or ripples at all. I would definitely use the product again."
4,Good product,"Good product, as described, shipped on time. The only thing that would have made it more useful to me is that if it had been oriented towards water well geophysical interpretations rather than oil well geophysical."
3,Gyrene,"If the many photgraphs which appear in this book are of importance to you....do NOT buy the paperback version. Unlike the hardback the paper stock in the paperback issue is of such low quality that all the photographs reproduce poorly, muddy and with poor resolution. The text is fine and does indeed fill a spot in the history of the USMC during WWII."
1,LAME,"This the last book in the CASCA series is a letdown. Haveing read the other 19, I expected much more."
3,"Not the last, and certainly not the best.","There are two other Casca books written after this one. I really didn't care for this one as much as most of the others. Most of the story is somehow lacking in personality or any sort of imagination. I would reccomend not reading this one (or number 21 for that matter) until you have checked out the other ones in the series. Number 22 was pretty good ,if I remember correctly, as well."
2,The rundown...,"I love heavily laden action/adventure stories. But this one, like quite a few latter others of this series, seemed like it was not even written by the illustrious author, Barry Sadler.This novel was convincing me that JOVE was paying a ghost writer off as being Barry Sadler. It was that sterile. Very unlike Sadler's work."
3,Interplay,"Cal Collins teams up with fellow guitarist Herb Ellis on this generally relaxed set recorded live at the 1980 Concord Jazz Festival. With bassist Ray Brown and drummer Jake Hanna completing the quartet, Collins and Ellis prove to be quite complementary on such tunes as ""Besame Mucho,"" ""People Will Say We're in Love"" and ""Limehouse Blues."" The two guitarists have similar but distinctive sounds and blend together quite well even if few sparks actually occur."
4,Top-notch hard science fiction,"Kevin Anderson and Doug Beason expertly take us into the depth of virtual reality. The story is a gripping tale of how technology can go wrong. Agent Kreident, the main character, is a computer savy FBI agent who specializes in high tech cases. He teams up with the young Paige Mitchell who helps spice up the plot a bit with undertones of innocent sexuality. This reviewer did find the Paige Mitchell character's usuage of the term, ""Kay-O"" (ie: okay), to be a bit annoying and over used. Overall, I'd rate the book as a great read, however."
5,Heroes Amongst Us,"I first heard Laura Rothenbeg's story on NPR- as a student at Brown she recorded her daily life with Cystic Fibrosis- waking up each day trying to breathe- multiple treatments each day to rid her lungs of the thick mucus that clogged her airways. A typical story of this chronic terminal disease, but told in private, personal terms. Laura was a model for other studnets her age- she so wanted to live and to love. She went through a bilateral lung transplant but suffered from chronic then acute rejection. She was able to find romantic love with Brian and friendship with her many friends. Whomever Laura knew she touched their lives, and many of these people remember her in their stories in this book. Tragically Laura died at age 22- she was ready to die when the time came, and she helped prepare her loved ones for this loss. People with Cystic Fibrosis are my heroes- they live each day trying to breathe-every day of their lives."
5,please read this book,"I am a 26 year old woman with cystic fibrosis. In reading Laura's memoirs I found a very real and honest view of what we (cf patients) go thru everyday. Laura had an amazing strength and courage to endure all her trials and I found reading her personal story helped me understand some of my own feelings.I think this book is a wonderful read for all persons...if you face an illness, know someone who does or just want to be touched by a lovely young womans story."
4,Read after hearing story on NPR,It's a quick read which surprised me given the poignancy of the subject matter. I wanted to read the book after I had heard her tapes on NPR last year. The book is a very personal account of living with (and ultimately dying of) cystic fibrosis and assumes a similar close knowledge of the disease. It does not contain much if any medical background to balance out the memoir.
2,heartfelt and sad but ultimately not compelling,"this book is well enough written, and its author goes through hell. her struggles were difficult; her death was tragic. however, this book doesn't capture the deepest level of her experience. it's somehow not very personal, although it's a memoir about the author. it reads a lot more like a diary, with events noted and visitors named but not much reflection on the meanings of things or explanation of the relationships the author had. not a bad book, but somewhat flat."
5,Edit your life,"Hard to find vintage collectible for film buffs.Hardback covers sound in production (tracks, etc), visuals, equipment & facilities, the mechanics of it (fees, missing shots, cutaways, rushes), using opticals, producing a soundtrack, sound cutting, laying music tracks, making short music longer, indicating opticals, master to showprint.Published in the UK, so you know it's thorough and good!"
5,"T is for Terrific, like all of this author's books","My 18-month old LOVES all of Peter McCarty's books. Even the ones that are for slightly older readers completely capture his attention. He loves everything about them--the pictures and the stories. When he was younger, they were the only books he would want to look at from cover to cover. And it's strange, because the drawings are quite artistic and are in muted colors, not the bold primary colors usually used in children's books. And a big plus -- the stories are so charming that even adults won't get sick of them (at least I haven't yet, after about 1,000 readings!)."
2,Much like Hondo and Fabian - Nice Art / No Story,"Again, very beautiful art with no story to back it up. The art is to be appreciated, however it's not as though the pictures are complex enough to grab the attention of the reader.Each page contains (on average) less than ten words. I'm surprised it is so well-liked.As for the subject of the TRex being a Carnivore, I think it's fine. Some things are the way they are, which is what the book is trying to convey. Acceptance of one's self. However, bizarre and lame ending.I only gave it two stars due to the beautiful art. Otherwise, I'd pass on this one. If you like this art style, pick up TINKA or MY BEST SWEET POTATO by Rainy Dohaney. Similar (possibly better) art with much more of a story."
5,Great Item!,Bought this for sister in law & their new Dobbie puppy. the dog & my sister in law were thrilled with the tree trolley. She was no longer wrapped up around the column unable to move b/c her leash was tied up. Great Item!
5,This album rocks!!!,"My boyfriend said this song reminded him of me, so i listened to it. Knowing that i normally hate my boyfriends music. But I loved it! Great C.D. Great songs. I love J.M. 4-ever"
4,Fantastic alt-Southern rock,"Saw this band at Atlanta's Big Day Out and loved them live -- The CD does justice to their great sound. If you like Train, check out Jump, Little Children for more progressive Southern rock'n'roll."
5,"RUN, do not walk to buy this CD","recipe for a great band....start with a mix of the Allman Brothers, add a slpash of Counting Crows, mix in some Collective Soul, a hint of Neil Young, and you come up with absoulutely the best new band out there. There is not one bad track on this CD.GREAT JOB, GUYS !!!!"
1,"can you say ""I've heard this before""","What a BLAND totally AVERAGE band. Thsese guys try to be different but end up sounding just like any other alt-rock band. If you like modern rock, you've heard this before, and you'll hear it again. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Boring!,"Absolutely one of the most uninteresting bands I have ever heard! If you're a fan of simple, mindless tripe, you'll love Train. Like a bar band that's finally made it big, Train lines their music with banal affectations and riffs stolen from Led Zeppelin and REM. Sure to be playing proms again in a year or two, this band is simply no fun."
1,Train,"I have to admit, I don't buy too many things based on the recommendation of strangers. But this time I decided to give the mass audience a chance.Boy what a mistake that was!Not only is it full of cliched pop tunes that seem to have no cohesiveness with the overall framework of the album, but it's also full of ripoff imitations of every great rock band in the last thirty years.To give it a chance, I listened to it over ten times in one week-end - each time hoping it would grow on me. Afterwards, I figured the only thing to do was to ""meet virginia"" and tell her quit her day-job."
5,Feel Good Music,"I only recently discovered Train and bought this album for ""Meet Virginia."" I'm very pleased with the album as a whole. It's smooth, feel good music."
4,Fresh...,"This is one of the best albums I bought in 97. A very refreshing experience. This band has a lot more substance than most of todays new groups. I've heard the comparison to R.E.M., but I find they remind me a lot more of The Tragically Hip. I highly recommend this album and look forward to hearing from this band again soon."
4,the next best thing to a Toad The Wet Sprockett reunion,"Somehow I think I'v found a band that can fill the void in my record collection left by the breakup of Toad/Sprockett. Train is a band that understands great melody and songcraft. The lyrics are meaningful and straight to the heart. The band does a great job of mixing harmonica, mandolin,and organ with their driving rock guitars and drums to give the listener a feeling of familiarity and warmth. Simply put this is a great band with great songs that deserve an honest listen. -Steve"
4,"Lots of new sounds, with a little Counting Crows","I heard ""Meet Virginia"" and was instantly hooked. ""Free"" is another top-quality song. About half of the songs didn't appeal to me that much, but the other half more than made up for it. If you like Counting Crows, you'll probably love this CD."
3,Great to listen to in the car,"I liked Train right off the bat. There's a song on the CD to match every mood your in. The best part of the CD is you think your only getting 10 songs but if you wait a few minutes after the last listed song plays, there's 2 more songs that are really great. I love hidden tracks and this band gives you more than the usual one. Talk about getting your money's worth!"
5,IT RULES!,The train cds is one of the best cds i have ever owned! I love all the tracks! My two favorites are meet virginia and number 4. I love train! they rock!
2,although meet virginia is catcy the rest is fair to bad.,CAN you say one hit wonder. in about a month train will be on sale at your local sore for .50 cents. good luck enjoying this one. i went to the rock section to find this!
1,O.k. but not the best,"I was expecting more when i bought this c.d. Besides ""meet Virginia"" and ""Free"", the c.d. didn't really have that much to offer. I would not recomend buying it."
1,Noooooooo!,"I am NOT a fan of this band or this album. I didn't like the slow, plodding ""Meet Virginia"" the first time I heard it, let alone the other 15,000,000 times.It amazes me that this is so popular! The amazon.com review compared this to REM. I think that is an extreemly bad comparison. This is a one-hit wonder band that will be outta here faster than Hootie (and I LIKED Hootie!)"
1,Very disappointed!,"OK, I bought this when Meet Virginia came out (before drops of jupiter) and thought it was going to be an awesome cd. NOIt was not. I did not like this cd.Meet Virginia & I am are the only songs I like.What a waste of money.Wonder if the second cd is any better?"
2,A BIG Disappointment,"I first listened to ""Meet Virginia"" and ""Drops of Jupiter"" and decided to start with this album...WOW...A BIG bucket of Cold Water! This album was terribly boring and very unoriginal. A fairly depressing album with little substance. If you think Train is all about ""Meet Virginia, Drops of Jupiter"" type of music, then do yourself a favor and DO NOT get this album...If you do, then don't say I didn't warn you!"
1,This system requires that I give at least one star...,"Comparing this band to REM is like comparing a dung beetle to Mecha Godzilla. Train is tiny, weak, and spends its days pushing around ... well, you know. In the story of Rock n' Roll, REM is legendary, Train is not even a footnote."
4,A Good Ride on the Train,"What a great suprise. This album is wonderful. Blind, Idaho, and the two hidden tracks are the stand outs. ""This is how I feel"" When I frist heard Train, on the radio, I thought it was David Bareward from David and David, the styling and vocals are very close. So put the disk in the cd player and take that Train to ""Idaho"", it will be a great trip."
5,Best of the year!,"Southern rock mixed with a little folk and a lot of class. I've had this album for months now and I still have yet to tire of it. Saw them live in Pgh. and became an even bigger fan! A future must-have for any collection.I'm not a country music fan either, by the way..."
4,Another good example that rock is back...,"This is one of the best new albums I've heard in a long time. I bought it because it satisfied my ""two good song"" rule: Any band can come up with a one-hit wonder, but a CD with TWO good songs on it is worth purchasing. And so, after hearing ""Free"" and ""Meet Virginia"" on the radio, and decided that Train was worth a try. Plus, I had seen them in concert with Ben Folds Five and had been quite impressed with their live show. Well, the rest of the CD doesn't disappoint. My suspicions that they have an affinity for the Allman Brothers (an affinity which this homesick Southern boy shares, by the way) were proven correct by the CD. Nothing like a little bit of guitar-driven rock to shake me out of my MTV-induced doldrums. Couple that with inspired lyric-writing and lead singer Patrick Monahan's sublime vocal stylings and you've got an album that will keep me listening for a long time. Train's self-titled debut is a worthy buy for any true rock-and-roll fan."
5,I love this album and Free is my favorite song.,I love Train. This band deserves a shot at the big time. I wish I could find a website about them. Does anyone know where I could. I went to a Hootie and the Blowfish and I enjoyed the band Train better than Hootie. I hope Trian makes it.
5,"Very melodic, extremely polished and well-done album.","I first heard about Train when I heard ""Free"" on the radio. I actually called the radio station and asked who it was and went out that night and bought their CD and to my delight, I love every single song on the CD. It has a good variety between soft and danceable music. Kudos to Train!!!"
4,A True Rock Record,"After hearing Meet Virginia about a year ago, I rushed out to buy the album. I was able to purchase it at the time for about $8. The album has it high point at the beginning, the first three songs are great, but seems to dillute towards the end. I recently saw Train live, and I must say I was a slight bit dissapointed, but this is a great album for any true rock and roll fan."
2,This is an okay album.,"This album is (once again) a okay album. This is the first album from Train's collection. It has their breakthrough song ""Meet Virginia"" on it. The other songs are okay and they're not that great really. I hope that you enjoy it though. I'm sorry if I offend you if I say that I never listen to this cd and that I probably shouldn't be writting this review, cause I haven't even listened to every single second of this album. I don't think I listened to #11 song ""Swaying"". I don't think I listened to #10 either. (That's ""Rat"".)"
3,Too little on too much,"World History for Dummies is valuable if you have already read more extensive literature on world history. In that respect, I would recommend it as a refresher, a tool to jar your memory of more indepth texts.Major advancements in western history, including ancient societies such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and of course Greece and Rome are covered. Other civilizations are represented as well, though not in as much detail as western civs. Examples include China, Japan, Aztecs, and Incas.I would recommend that an historical text on geography accompany this book as maps are scarce and the ones available aren't very comprehensive. This is a particular peeve since it is often nice to have a visual perspective of what is being studied.All in all, a good ""reference for the rest of us"", but not a text I would recommend for the first-time reader."
2,See next chapter for reference to previous chapter.,"How many times can an author say ""as covered in chapter..."" or ""see chapter .."" If you want to find out, read this book. It gets so bad that all you do is focus on how terrible a writer this guy is and not on the content of the book.Im still not sure exactly how the book was organized. Whether by time or content or subject. I guess it really wasn't organized at all.Im sorry that I don't have a better book to recommend, but I can tell you to save your time on this one."
4,A Great Fun Resource!,"As a high school history teacher this book is a great resource for quick, fun ways to make history more interesting for kids who generally do not want to be learning history. The cartoons, brief descriptions, movie connections and abundance of information in a quick and easy to access format helps with a complex and dense subject. I can highly recommend this book as a resource and idea book."
5,Casual yet classy,"I've read Peter Haugen's other work, and always remain impressed. He clearly knows his stuff. Most important, he knows how to translate it into a nice read that keeps a casual, yet classy, tone throughout. (Even inside the parenthesis.) That's perfect for a general overview of world history. Is it a PhD-level dissection of night-time flanking movements by the Roman Legion? No. It's not meant to be. (I have no doubt Mr. Haugen would do a splendid job on said flankings if he wished.) It's a one-volume overview of 10,000 years of human development and history, packaged into the Dummies series: i.e., aimed at a general reader who wants to learn the world in a single volume, or refresh what he or she learned in school. (At age 54, that's why I read it: to refresh myself on all the stuff I'd forgotten since college history.) This is the second edition, and it reads even better than the first. I highly recommend it."
1,Superficial at best,"If you are someone who is interested in their personal education and wants to know the basic fundmanetals of world history, I would NOT reccomend this.This book seems to have been written for the purpose of giving someone who is in a college history course just enough superficial knowledge to feign comprehensions on exams.The book is not written in chronological order, instead it has many topics and just writes about different eras of history in regards to those topics. Essentially, its just a fact book, with silly jokes in it, intended for people who are not interested in history, but still not engaging enough to even hold their attention. There is a difference between memorizing facts and understanding ideas, which this book does not seem to grasp.If you are over 18, likely, this book is too childish for you."
2,Chaotic,"I couldn't go past 100 pages. What I read was written in a very disorganized way. It keeps going back and forward in time which makes it very difficult to follow. Then it will go through hundreds of years in a paragraph while devoting a lot more text to explain random details. Overall, I found it pretty messy and hard to read."
2,Insulting to Dummies,"This book is an affront to Dummies. It is also below the standard set by the For Dummies series (Estate Planning for Dummies is excellent). A Dummy would be better advised to get a used copy of a world history textbook, for less money, and just read the table of contents. It's difficult to imagine who Haugen's target reader is, since even Dummies have choices."
4,Perform as expected,"Nice stickers. I've been using them on my iMac's keyboard for about 2 years. No issues, not a single one peeled or moved. I blind type in English but not in Russian, so I really like that the Russian letters stand out. That's the only time when I need to look at keyboard."
3,Needs modification,The stickers should cover the whole key and include the english letters as well. As it is the Russian letters stand out much more and make english letters harder to read. I touch type some but due to a stroke don't do as well as I used to so I sometimes have to look for letters.ji
2,Not at all rowdy enough,"A very disappointing effort at creating a sexy western action spoof. The producers put tall former Playmate Of The Year/B-Movie star Shannon Tweed (good girl) and tall former Penthouse Pet of The Year/B-Movie star Julie Strain (bad girl) together in a western setup, and somehow fail to exploit this casting coup. Next to no face-to-face rivalry between these two, and at times Tweed and Strain seem to be playing in two different films, shooting on two separate sets. The two might have been paired in a sexy girl/girl scene, or certainly set against each other in a catfight parody of the Old West showdown. But neither possibility is explored--- haven't the producers learned the true meaning of the word ""Exploitation""?? Film is competently made, but has no real raunchiness or gusto to its concept. A golden opportunity wasted."
2,B-Western,"I have to say, I didn't expect a lot before I watched this film. Maybe this is why I was not disappointed. I do like the story background set in the old Western and I am glad at least they tried to have a plot in the movie. Don't expect a lot of explicit nudities even though the film features Shannon and Julie. The love scenes are quite tame. However, Richie Varga who played the sheriff's brother is very cute and adorable. He can act as well. Hope he will be seen in many other films."
4,An Erotic Western?,"Shannon Tweed and Julie Strain, the Queens of Adult thrillers together in one Movie, yes it is set in the old west. Yes Julie is the Bad girl and over the top as always, Shannon is the good girl prostitute who just wants her money back. Pretty good plot and well acted. These ladies could hold their own against any A list actress. The only flaw this movie has are the song intervals to switch from one scene to the other, very blazing saddles."
5,surprisingly intense and compelling,"This is not an animation but has some cheesy animation at the beginning for some weird reason. Once you get into the actual movie, it was pretty intense with good acting. Story was interesting and made you wanting to watch more but unfortunately ended after 2 episodes. Hope they make more."
2,Where's the rest of it?,"The setup hd everything, syfy, action, mysterious plague with plucky [...] group to quell,the madness. all is going great until it seems to cut off right in the midl...."
4,"Looked like a ""bootleg""","I bought this as a Christmas present for my grandson to add to his Aladdin series of disney movies. It looked like it was copied from the original vhs version, it was packaged like a copy of the original as well.It played well, but again I think it was a homemade copy of the original vhs version."
4,"From funny to sad, a must read for ecdysiast lovers!","This San Francisco dancer has written a very personal, almost diary like account of her experiences stripping, from when she first started as a waitress to her ups and downs in publishing her book. Many people have always asked what living the life of a stripper is like. Well, this book gives you a pretty good idea and then some. From her detailed accounts and character descriptions, you will get to know Shay as well as the people she came in contact with as if you were right there with her. It reads like a Judy Bloom book, but with an obviously different subject matter. There are many funny, interesting, and sometimes even sad and brutally real accounts of strip club life through the eyes of this real life stripper. At 375 pages, this is not a short book, and if given the choice, we may have cut out a couple of chapters. However, this is definitely one good read."
2,If you wanna read about her boyfriends...,"This book is okay, interesting at times. But the author spends WAY too much time writing about her various boyfriends (biggest collection of losers I've ever read about)."
5,strippers actually do speak!,She's unbelievable witty! I had to put the book down several times to just guffaw. I love it that the brains appear from behind the bimbo mask. What a warrior this woman is. What a world to live in.
4,Captures perfectly the Airplane's fragile chemistry.,"This band was raising hell a decade before I was even born and the music sounds as involving to me as I'm sure it did to those who were its contemporaries.What I can say is that the musicians are some of the most impressive I've ever heard: Jack Casady's legendary bass dexterity, Jorma Kaukonen's cutting guitar work, Grace Slick's concise, majestic vocal maelstrom, Marty Balin's romantic croon. Some of the material (mostly Balin's) is weaker, but the classics -- ""Somebody to Love"", ""Volunteers"", ""Today"" and the song that got me hooked on the Airplane in the first place, ""White Rabbit"" -- hold up remarkably well."
3,For the true Jefferson Airplane fan,"I got this three-disk set at a nice price, and I have enjoyed listening to it. If you want to hear what the San Francisco sound was like back in the day, you will want this CD. It's like a live concert back in the day. And you do get some rarities here. The thing is many of these cuts are excessively long.If you love JA and you want it all and you have the studio recordings this is it. If you are just starting with JA or want a good collection of the definitive versions, I'd suggest ""The Essential Jefferson Airplane"" instead.Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"
1,But whose blood?,"Play like this book recommends against anyone who can play at all, and you will bleed money. The classic book from that era, when backgammon was a national craze, is Backgammon by Paul Magriel. I was playing for a living at the time, and I assure you, Paul was the real deal. I assume he still is. But even his book contains mistakes that a modern expert would spot at a glance. Get something new."
3,Great book with which to begin,"Ray's review is excellent. This is a book that will raise a player's standing from novice to accomplished novice, but it will not, by itself, raise a player above the novice level.This book was written before personal computers, before FIBS, before Snowie, and before GNUbg so it lacks the depth that is available 20+ years later.But it is an excellent book to give a young child who wants tolearn backgammon."
5,A must read for backgammon beginners,"I bought this book many years ago, a 7th-grade kid with no knowledge of Backgammon. My younger brother & I both read it cover to cover, then played about 1,000 games of Backgammon on our old Atari game system. Backgammon for Blood was excellent in teaching the probabilities of dice, a love of the game, and going for the throat (figuratively, of course.) A great book"
3,I expected more,I'm German and I was looking for a book to teach German to my boyfriend. This is not what I was looking for. It's not bad (especially for practicing pronunciation) but it moves on too fast. I've learned 3 languages so far so I kinda know what a good structure and speed for learning a language is and I feel like this book is asking for too much too soon. If somebody has no German knowlege at all this is not a good book to work with. Unless you are able to remember every word that was ever mentioned. I know different people learn differently and I'm sure if you are very devoted to learning German this book can get you pretty far. In my opinion it just doesn't seem fun to learn from this book. I'm still using it occasionally but most of the time I just make worksheets myself that are more structured and fun.
5,All you need to start learning german,Great book that will guide you through all the grammar in a easy and funny way. It's the kind of book you won't want to put down. Easy to understand and have lots of exercises.
3,sloppy presentation,"This book is riddled with typographical and formatting errors. For example, what is supposed to be a heading is placed underneath a section. The formatting in general is not very user-friendly. It's okay if you want an inexpensive introduction to German, but I will avoid books in this series in the future."
3,"Messy structure, but not too bad","This book has somewhat messed up structure and complicates simple things while oversimplifies more important things.This approach doesn't work for me very well.If you really want to learn German, start with Michele Thomas and then, build up with anything. Even this book might become somewhat useful after you have an understanding of why things happen as they do.Beginner 8 CDs:German with Michel ThomasAdvanced 5 CDs:Michel Thomas Method German Advanced, 5-CD Program (Michel Thomas Series)Language builder:Michel Thomas German Language Builder (Michel Thomas Series)And then, there is a vocabulary builder and other variations on Michel Thomas method, like this one:Michel Thomas Method' German For Beginners, 10-CD Program (Michel Thomas Series)or this:German With Michel Thomas (Teach Yourself)"
3,"Cheap book, but tread carefully","I feel that this book is improperly formatted and that there are many errors in the construction of the pages. Section headings and notes are strewn randomly on the page in no logical order except for a few occasions which seem to be accidental.The book is a fairly cheap workbook with many exercises, so weighing that as a positive I give this book a 3 star rating. I don't think it should be anywhere near 5 stars as the average suggests. Maybe that is because people rate language books by the cover! If they aren't really trying to use the books it makes sense too!"
4,excellent for beginners or a refresher,excellent format with short logical laid out lessons that build on the last exercise.wish I bought this book before I wasted money on german for dummies.The dummies series are going down hill
3,German made simple,"I took two years of German in high school a number of years ago, and am going to Germany this spring and wanted to pick up where I left off. The book is OK, however it assumes you know what ""accusative"" ""dative"" ""participles"" and other things are you learned in high school. This has slowed me way down. Definitions of these terms would have been very helpful since German has lots of gender specifics that are difficult to figure out."
3,Great if you are new to the language,I've taken two weeks of German and have already learned everything in this book. Only buy this book if you are a complete beginner to German.
3,So far so good,I just started using the workbook(that is what this is) the lessons are easy to follow and the pictures really helped me figure out how to form the various sounds. Only time will tell.
2,Where's the logic?,"I gave this book a chance. I made it to the middle of chapter three and decided to buy another resource. The information is presented in an illogical order (new vocabulary after you are asked to use it) and to make matters worse words are thrown in to the exercises that have not been introduced. That would be OK but the book's format does not make searching for the mystery words easy. Also, in some exercises words are introduced incidentally as an after thought and after you need to know them. My suggestion? Introduce vocabulary FIRST that is needed in the chapter exercises and lessons. Add more reference lists that can easily be accessed as students are trying to commit to memory the principles being taught."
5,Two by Two is Too Much Fun!,"This is a delightful and enlightening day-long journey in the lives of 2-year-olds. Adults and children alike will enjoy watching as these toddlers play, socialize, experiment and test their limits. They made me laugh and remember when my now grown daughter was two. Enjoy!"
5,Preparation for Parents with soon to be 2 year olds,"As a mother of a soon to be 2 year old I appreciate the knowledge this video shares. I feel a little less apprehensive about going for the ride into the ""terrible twos"" with my son."
5,Solid add-on,"Needed this after attaching a buttstock to my A5 since I was unable to look down the rail to see through the iron sights. Ended up carrying a red dot.Made of aluminum so it is sturdy. Uses different sized allen head bolts than the ones used to hold the A5 together. It's really annoying when taking the marker apart and getting the allen keys mixed up, but does not hurt the functionality of the rail. New rail will also block the iron sights on the marker."
1,For Cryin' Out Loud...,"I just read the -excerpt- of this book, and there's no way I'm going to beg, borrow, steal, or actually pay for it to read the whole thing. Seems Bronson is only interested in sharing one side of a story; the juicy, and sometimes not even accurately portrayed one. Not only does he take Hewan's quote completely out of context (with regard to the police), but he apparently doesn't bother to talk to any of those individuals who learned from, admired, and truly respected him as a professor. Clinton Hewan merely speaks the truth; Bronson wouldn't know it if it bit him in the *ss."
5,Cincinnati. . .For Pete's Sake,"Peter Bronson has a wonderful way with words. His columns range from the very humerous, to poignant, to controversial. A great gift for anyone who likes good writing!"
3,Not for the faint of Heart,"While very thorough, this book is almost as dry to read as the W3 specifications on which the technology is based. Incredibly complex examples are lightly touched on leaving you the reader sifting through (in some cases) pages of listings trying to find the differences between various versions. No effort is made to help steer the user through the examples. While this is a good reference for those with a firm grasp of concepts I think it could be immeasurably better written. Also, huge leaps are being made without examples.3 stars for thouroughness of content, 2 deducted for being not in the least bit user-friendly."
2,A Comprehensive but poorly written book,"On the plus side, this book hits all the bases. The code examples are well chosen and concise. The information seems accurate and up to date.Unfortunately its something of a hodgepodege. The lead author does a poor job of organizing the book into a coherent whole.It refers in passing to concepts which are not covered until later in the book. If this were my first XML book, I think I would find these quite confusing. At the local Borders I spent some time looking through ""Learning XML"" by O'Reilly ( admittedly a less comprehensive and advanced book) and was struck by it s better, clearer the writeing."
2,Poorly Explained Material,"This book suffers badly from two problems: multiple authors and padding. Padding makes some of the sections too ""chatty"", while paradoxically failing in providing a good explanation of the material. Multiple authors makes the quality of the content sections very variable. At best they are adequate, at worst appauling.Take the XML Schema chapter. Its painful to read, with complex examples badly explained and a more or less random list of individual features explained not very well. Understanding XML Schema by reading this chapter is like learning a foreign language by reading a dictionary.There are FAR better choices for XML coverage, such as the OReilly series."
3,Not that bad,"Not a bad book. Especially if you want to learn some tricks to make for bigger size. For example, chapter 4 XML Schemas consists of 61 pages. 17 of them are REDUNDUND repetitions (I do not count here those that make sense) of the same schema and xml source file. The schema, about 3 pages, placed in the beginning of the chapter. Than they change an attribute in one element and ""illustrate"" this repeating all 3 pages.Systematically an element that with no problem fits in one row spans, nevertheless, two.There are some other useful tricks. Find yourself. It's not a bad book."
5,Lovely Late Night Music of John Mandel,"This is a beautiful disc for dinner, lights low, and your favorite friend across the table. Recorded in 1981. All tunes from the pen of Johnny Mandel. Bass player Dean Reilly had been with Cal and Vince G. from the '50's. This may have been Cal's last recording before passing on to Jazz Heaven. Scott Hamilton shares the scene and Hank Jones takes you away as only he can. Lovely classic music. Mandel is a treasure we need more of in our lives. Very recommended."
4,"Yes, but","I wanted a readable introduction to philosophy, and Morris provided that. The book was entertaining and informative and did not throw me, sink or swim, into some deep philosophical pool. I found the author to be fair in his presentation, leaving me to chart a sovereign course. So I recommend this book. But do not follow it up with the author's recent works. Something seems to have happened to Tom Morris on his way from Notre Dame to The Morris Institute for Human Values. Today he sounds more like a salesman than a professor."
4,No dummy,"This book is not what I expected from a work entitled ""Philosophy for Dummies"". In fact, I'm not sure what I expected but this warm, passionate, humorous and personal examination of philosophy caught me by surprise and rapidly drew me in. It is a real winner. The negative reaction of a minority of previous reviewers is not unexpected however. The author makes no attempt to hide his own position: a convinced and convincing theism. His ""bias"" obviously upsets some atheists but I would much rather read this passionate and ""friendly"" introduction to life's big questions than some dry tome that pretends to fairness but whose heart is a heart of darkness. Actually I think I do know what I expected from an introductory book on philosophy - cold, ivory tower intellectualism and word games - but what I got from this book was something much more envigorating, satisfying and hopeful. Recommended."
1,"Oh God, Please Help me!!!","Awful, absolutely awful.I could only get half way through (it was that bad), so unless Morris started using Logic in the second half, please don't buy it!"
1,Keep you religious opinions to yourself,"This book would have been an interesting if abbreviated overview had that the author been able to keep his religious predjudice to himself. There were several times when I actually laughed out loud as he baldly dismisses any argument that incorporates atheism as a world view of ""what's the point?"". I don't like it when an author inserts his religiously biased view point into what is supposed to be an overview text. No thanks."
5,for the love of wisdom,"If one wants a sound grounding in philosophy, then get this book.It shall get your mind reshaping, and reshaping, and reshaping from the moment you realize that its views make you think differently (or must I say philosophically?) When it hits you that the book's contents could help you in your everyday life, be it in personal or professional situations, then you'll be very thankful for having ""a great conversation with Dr. Tom Morris."" And I tell you, that just might take a few moments from the time you read the first few pages of the book!"
1,Great Expectations: Great Disappointment,"If you come to this book thinking that the author is going to be talking to you as a philosophy-novice, you will be disappointed. He is not talking to ""beginners."" The author sets his material in a reader-friendly context: cartoons, visuals, short paragraphs, but his writing is dense, his progression of thought is not obvious and his use of jargon is inexcusable in a text that is supposed to make philosophy accessible to non-philosophers. You might enjoy this book if you have a background in philosophy--but even then, you might find his treatment of topics very dull."
1,Author is Biased,"I agree with several other reviewers that this book greatly reflects the author bias. I don't think this is appropriate for an Introduction to Philosophy book. I guess I was able to pick up on the author's bias because I have done other reading on the subject, this may not happen with someone who is truly looking for an introduction. ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy"" is much better (and more scholarly while remaining readable) than this book."
1,Weird ideas don't add up to philosophy,"Tom Morris has a nice easy style, but my! This book is full of nonsense. I'm not really impressed to hear that he thinks he speaks to angels, and that they predicted one day he would be a great philosopher (they were wrong...) I don't even spend my whole life worrying about whether or not there is a heaven and if so, how do I get in - and so I'm not really interested to read about the his 'new' theory about the 'conservation of belief' - which shows that 'in fact' it is sensible to believe in God. I don't care about this stuff because none of it is what I'd call philosophy. Fortunately, just as I was losing faith in the Dummies series, someone showed me the UK version, which is both fun AND about philosophy."
2,Subjective and Offfensive,"Although you will find some very insightful ideas and quotes in this book, it is really the story of how Tom Morris views the world and its greatest thinkers. Morris subtly tries to guide the reader to a certain opinion and explain why all the differing opinions lack merit. Some may find that this book affirms the beliefs that they already have. Others may be offended because Morris does not forgive those who have opinions that are different than his own. I fully expected to not agree with Morris on some subjects, but I was offended by his attempts to mask his objectives in writing the book."
3,I wish it were written objectively. . .,"I have to admit that the book seemed awesome at first, but then I got to parts of the book that kept pushing ""God."" I was surprised at first and took a look at the section relating to the existence of God, and I must admit that I was stunned. I looked at a few chapters before and after and saw the one sided argument all over the place. Tom Morris goes as far as accusing the atheist position of being irrational. He somehow believes that atheism and a happy life cannot go together. I was severely dissappointed by a lot of his views on atheism--it took away from the great information this book had. I returned the book the next day; I just couldn't stand his one sidedness."
1,Christian Propaganda,"This book is thinly disguised Christian propaganda. It presents a lopsided view of philosophical views with the intent of convincing the hypothetical newcomer that christian ideas are prevalent and dominant in philosophy. Any argument that disagrees is presented as a strawman and then dismissed.If the book was open about its agenda to began with, this wouldn't be a problem, but it sneakily presents itself as an objective introduction, which makes it subversive and blatantly dishonest."
1,Probably a good book...,The book never showed up. They just refunded my $ and told me to keep the book as their gift when it got delivered. A gift that doesnt exist? Gee thanks. I've made hundreds of purchases on Amazon and Ebay and have never had a product just not show up. Everybody makes mistakes but their was no attempt on their part to satisfy the customer. Thats why they just lost this one.
2,Slanted toward Judo-Christian beliefs.,"This book isn't a summary or even an introduction to all philosophies, only ones that seem to compliment Judo-Christian faiths. If less pages were spent debating only two types of western beliefs, there would have been plenty of room for several other belief systems to be mentioned, and then the book would have been a more useful resource."
5,Training Your Brain,"You're interested in philosophy and want to learn something about the subject. Now, you could jump right into Immanuel Kant's ""Critique of Pure Reason"" but we'd probably never hear from you again. Instead, I recommend ""Philosophy for Dummies"". Tom Morris poses the big questions, offers some possible big answers, then leaves it to you to decide what you think. It's all done in a light but thorough way -- the philosophical facts are there, minus the jargon that can be off-putting for the non-professional philosopher (besides, you can pick up the lingo later if you do more reading in the field). Morris' central concern is philosophy's relevance to life, which makes this book particularly useful for the general reader (and for us specialists who need to have ""the principle of sufficient reason"" laid out on one page). The book makes you want to read MORE philosophy -- thus the Socratic dialogue continues. Its information on the non-Western traditions is particularly welcome."
1,I do not recommend this book.,"Tom is a smart man, and capable of writing a good introductory to philosophy book. He just chose not to. The only thing this book is really good for is listing off the names of some of the different philosophical beliefs. I imagine he turned this book into a simplified version of some of his other books, and he promotes some of his other books at different times in Philosophy for Dummies.Parts of this book are offensive because in Tom's eyes you are irrational for not believing everything he does, even when he doesn't offer a particularly strong argument why you should believe him. He tries to steer the reader in his direction the whole time instead of giving you a fuller understanding of the philosophers. I strongly don't recommend this book. You would be much better off just purchasing a used philosophy 101 text."
3,A fair overview of philosophy but....,"I've read some of the negative reviews of this book and while I can't wholeheartedly agree with all that's been said, I can agree on some of the issues raised. It does seem as while Morris does explain a lot of the basic philosophical ideas, he doesn't cover enough, and he does indeed seem to be biased and isn't objective.The only other complaint I have with this book is Morris repeatedly mentioning the other books on philosophy he's written. Doc Morris, you've got some good stuff in here, but do you have to plug your other books in the middle of explaining a philosophical concept?I guess I'll be the odd duck out and give it three stars. Two stars held back because of the author not being objective, exclusion of some other schools of thought and what seems to be shameless self promotion."
2,Insulting and self serving,"I won't go into much detail beyond saying that the author attempts to frame important questions in a scientific manner and doesn't use scientific criteria to evaluate them, nor does he reach any conclusions that are practical. He might be earnest, perhaps, but he fails both on the scientific and the ""practical"" side. This book is not for geniuses nor for ""dummies""."
2,Manipulative Catholic Philosophy for Unsuspecting Dummies,"I own a large number of dummies publications. I have found them to be a clear, neutral and unbiased reference sources, particularly when I am new to a subject. Unfortunately, this is not true of Philosophy for Dummies. This book is highly biased and should have been entitled Manipulative Evangelical Catholic Philosophy for Unsuspecting Dummies. This is a very sneaky book whose true intention, namely to prove to you that God exists and that you should believe in God, doesn't really become apparent until you are about halfway through the bookTo do a quick, objective comparison I also purchased the Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy. What a difference! Not as well written but a truly objective overview of the major lines of philosophy. Unfortunately I will need to be much more careful and less trusting in the future particularly when I look at nontechnical Dummies books."
2,Book of Theology,"Philosophy for Dummies is a book of theology, not philosophy. A nice philosophy for someone who can't put his hand on God but wants to real badly. As for his 'Principal of belief conservation', a ship cannot sail, Mr. Morris, if it is anchored in the same old harbor.You can find things worth exploring in this book but Philosophy 101 it is not. Watch out for chapter 10! He really goes ""unsubstantiated"" by that point."
2,Extremely Subjective,"Although the book wasn't all that bad (it did have a lot of useful information), I was hoping for a factual and objective look at different philosophic questions. This book had way too much of the author's opinions."
1,Have to agree with the crowd,"I've studied philosophy - Socrates, Confucius, Descarte, Nietzche, etc - and had picked up this book as a refresher hoping for two things: (1) an overview of the great philosophers, and (2) an overview of their best-known ideas. A more apt title would be ""Philosophizing for Dummies.""If that's what you're looking for, too, you definitely will not find it here. It's mainly one author discussing his own take on Life's Big Questions: pretty much the same thing you could get from an afternoon of fishing with that quirky uncle you don't see very often but always says such memorable things (and then if nothing else, you'd at least have fish)."
3,beginner piano by ear,"this is a good beginner video, it teaches one song only, the first half of video is to get to know the keyboard and finger posistioning,, if you already know this i recommend you skip and go to the next level up,, he is a very good teacher though!!"
5,I Love this Video!!,"I love this video, I use it with hit the spot abs. It gives you one low impact video of fun things like cha/chas. then when I got a little more in shape I started alternating between the first and second part. a 20 min fat blaster. 3min intense areobics and 1 min weights toning. the minibursts kept me going. Plus she smiles and encourages you all the way through...cheesy, yes, but for people like me, I'd rather think they are having fun, than watching some of those videos that try to look intense. This is a great video. worth the money."
3,Chistmas SWV Style.,"This is one of the best Hip-Hop/Soul Chirstmas Albums I have ever hear. Taj, Coko & Lelee prove to the fan the they can do much more then the other girl groups that are out today. Once again they prove that they are SISTER WITH VOCIES."
3,Predictable yet satisfying Christmas offering,"SWV's 1997 Christmas album ""A Special Christmas"" was the R&B trio's final recording, and while not the climactic finale that many fans may have hoped for, it is a solid offering of holiday music. The Sisters With Voices perform standards as well as some more contemporary tunes true to the 90s urban Christmas format. Performances are solid and their voices sound strong. My favorite songs are the extremely catchy ""This Christmas"" and ""Christmas Ain't Christmas,"" a pair of upbeat and heartfelt numbers where their soaring voices sound great over the excellent production. While the standards sound good, they suffer from generic and predictable arrangements that keep them from being memorable efforts. Another flaw I find is the corny spoken intros and interludes. While ""A Special Christmas"" is not among the best of the urban Christmas market, it is a solid album and will appeal to SWV's fans."
1,I found the product worthless. I got it immediately.,"I cannot fault the vendor. But the product is useless. You just CAN'T lie on it face down. It doesn't elevate your head at all. It's uncomfortable, and having RECENTLY used 2 face-down pillows at a chiropractor's and an acupuncturist's offices - I don't understand why this one is so uncomfortable and useless. Pass it up!"
3,Bob Norris Does it well,"Bob Norris does a wonderfull job writing this book. It is easy to understand and follow. I am a huge military enthusiast, but I am speaking from the point of view of someone who just likes to occasionally read a military book, and it is a great choice. You can't beat that price either. Once you start reading it you will have a hard time puting it down.Enjoy it! I sure did."
4,INTRIGUING HINT OF THE EAST IN THIS FRAGRANCE,"This is one of the early women's fragrances launched by Boucheron. It is more dramatic than Initial, highlighted by a floral Oriental tone.Jaipur or ""jewel"" was inspired by a trip made by the company's current president's grandfather to Jaipur, a city whose reputation for precious stones was legendary. Thus, the fragrance was introduced in a jewel flacon. The original bottles are, of course, highly prized by collectors today.Long recognized as makers of elegrant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched."
4,Scholarly but disappointing...,"Other reviewers have aptly summarized this book, touting its main value, a succinct summary of the developing censorship of 'offensive' media. I, for one, am disappointed that this book never looks beyond the legal realm to which its study is confined. Simply stated, the book sadly fails to explain why all the fuss? If we accept the thesis, underwhelming at best, that little evidence justifies the government's intrusions made under the banner of protecting the children, no effort is made to explain why this tactic is so pervasive or persuasive. When the government protects, who exactly is being protected, from what, and why?"
2,This thing just eats my bad,"DON""T BUY THIS MOUSE. I just gave my Microsoft 4000 mouse to my brother to get this one. I've had it for a month. I changed batteries twice already. BAD BAD MOUSE. I'm thinking about give away this mouse to someone and get Microsoft 6000. Trust me on this. OHH by the way Microsoft mouse is more comfortable to use."
1,Logitech V400 Laser Cordless Mouse,"This dual laser mouse was to work on uneven surfaces. It does not and on a flat surface, it is poor at best. I gave it away."
2,Sleepy Head,"The design of this mouse is very thoughtful, the size is good for notebook usage, the USB receiver can be put back to mouse to be stored so that it won't be lost.However, the mouse sleeps way too aggressively for power saving, I spend about 15 second typing and it goes to sleep and it takes way too long to wake up 5-10 seconds. I can not put up it with it."
1,Terrible tracking - no precision,"Strengths: Looks Nice.Feals OK.Weaknesses: Tracking is an absolute disaster and for High Resolution applications this mouse is useless.Summary: I bought one three days ago and it really sucks the tracking is so bad. I have called several times to logitech tech support and tried various things they have suggested but nothing has helped.I can't return it because I don't have the original packaging anymore and Logitech don't want to help out here!!This mouse is a real waste of money and must be at this stage a beta version of their new ""Dual Laser Engine""I ended up buying a Microsoft Notebook Laser 6000 and the difference is amazing. Could be that the Logitech v500 is ok as well but I don't like the shape at all and at this point I don't feel like giving Logitech another chance."
1,Just don't be in a hurry,"The design is excellent; however, you need a lot of patience to use this mouse. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone as there are much better alternatives (even from Logitech). It is constantly ""sleeping"" and it takes a second to respond to movement."
2,"YEP the tracking is not good, Microsoft wins this and by much.","Hi all,I have both, the V400 and the Microsoft 6000, the V400 has many problems, seems like the laser engine has many betas still to go, the tracking is awfull, constantly stopping and restarting, the precision also is too bad, is very difficult to give in the target with this mouse, more if you try with CAD applications, any person, even the basic PC user will notice the bad quality of the laser mechanism.Is true, is a nice looking mouse, i have many logitech products that are really good, from the presentation bluetooth mouse to the laser one, this V400 seems to break the line of quality logitech has always had.Kinda disappointing,I'm uploading pictures of my mouse, so if you want to have a mouse to look and show, the V400 could be a museum object, but if you want a extreme machine, the Microsoft 6000 is the one to go.GreetingsSergio Claver from Lima, PERU :)"
3,Every thing is great except the size is smaller than needed,The mouse is awesome and installation is so simple. Only the size is small does not comfortably fit in your hand
2,i dont know why i purchased this item,"i'm really not satisfied with V400... the accelaration is terrible.. tracking is the worst part.. sometimes the pointer goes wherever it wants.. easily get confused.. clicking is so noisy.. programmable forward/backward buttons are not really programmable, i mean you cannot assign them whatever you want... they dont work even for volume up and down (if someone could do it pls share with me how to assign the volume control)...when you lift the mouse for a while and then put it back again, for a few seconds it doesnt recognize that it is on the ground again and it just wait still...all in all, i am really angry with logitech because they produce such a terrible and workless product...the best and the coolest thing is its design, but it is nothing either if it does not work!"
3,Small but nicely built,It is smaller than I expected - but the dimensions are listed so that is my fault. Nicely finished and constructed.
2,Shwedagon Golden Pagoda of Myanmar,It is disappointing that the photography in this book fails to do justice to what is a magnificent symbol of Buddhist worship in Myanmar.
1,Waste of money,The front is comfortable but the rear is way off center so it feels uncomfortable. I wouldn't give a dollar for this a refund would work
1,Terrible,"These bagpipes are made using an inferior wood in Pakistan. The bores are poorly machined, and the bag doesn't seal well. The chanter is very flat. You'll be lucky if you can get a sound out of the chanter reed because it's so hard to blow (even for me as an experienced piper). Best to save your money and purchase a good instrument from a reputable maker."
1,I would have loved it........,"BEWARE....I paid 4.99 for this book and the font was TEENSY and did not adjust using my font adjustments on my 3rd generation Kindle. I LOVE Amish cookbooks and was giddy to find this one.....But again, it's not readable. I had to contact customer service and they deleted this book and will refund money paid. SO.....if anyone has these issues with this book it's not YOU or your Kindle....it's the book. I would love to see this fixed so I can purchase it."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited when I saw this, for free even. We get the Amish Cook columns in our local newspaper, and I love them.But the Ebook is a disaster. No intro, no index, nothing but scanned newspaper columns. The font can't be adjusted, because it's just pictures of the columns. Pretty much unreadable on the Kindle. Don't waste your time downloading this version."
3,"Cheap, Basic Scarf","I was hoping the mittems would be a bit nicer and warmer, but for the price, I guess this is what you get."
2,Try again,Men in Kilts by Katie Macalister was not my favoriate novel by this author. I see a pattern in her novels and after a few novels I am bored with her material.
4,"Fun story,","I found ""Men in Kilts"" by Katie Macalister, to be a fun story. The characters were fun and believable, the dialogue fun and fast, and the plot fun and entertaining. An appealing combination.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion PicturesB. H. California"
1,Total Crap,"The main female character was so whiny, I couldn't believe the sheep farmer could take it. I couldn't see what could have possibly endeared him about her. When she nutured his cat without his permission, I threw this book away."
3,Humorous fun,"Humorous fun with a plot that is pure fantasy for any girl who loves Scotland and that mouth watering brogue! The heroine was the downside. Oh my goodness, she cried over everything! When someone said something rude, she sobbed. When she was embarrassed, she sobbed. When she was afraid she sobbed (could go on in finite um!) These were not just little trickle tears, either, they were air gulping drown your shirt gully whoppers! If not for her sense of humor, this book would have hit the (fire) wall."
2,BORING....,"Wow, what a disappointment. There is absolutely no action in this book, yet the female lead finds something to cry about every time she turns around! While the book does have some funny scenes, I wouldn't recommend it. I hate to admit I paid full price for it."
2,I don't get it,"Sorry folks but I just don't get it why everyone loves this author! She seems to like whiney, clingy, self-centered woman who don't act their age and who no self-respecting ""alpha male"" (her term) I know woud be interested in. Geesh!Despite my negative experience with the Corset Diaries, I still read this book, mainly because I had already bought it. I read about half the book and was about to toss it when admittely it got a bit more interesting (or perhaps less irritating?). Like Corset, the character development was almost non-existant. But I gave it a second star - one more than Corset Diaries because I made it to the end of the book.Both will be on the table at the garage sale this summer!"
5,Fun Reading! MacAlister Creates The BEST Men!,"OMG! (This is what this book has evolved me into...a 36 yr old woman who just typed ""OMG""!!!) I adored this book! Laugh out loud funny with a sexy leading man - two ""musts"" in a wonderfully fun and romantic read by an author who has perfected romantic comedy. ;)"
5,LOVE men in Kilts,"Must have book! - Funny where you laugh out-loud so many times, cheer when true love wins, and have a warm place in your heart with hope."
1,Don't bother!,"Let me begin by saying this is the 8th MacAlister book I've read. I enjoyed her Aisling Grey series so figured I would try some of her other works. Lets just say thanks to this addition I have now sworn off this author. It was a slippery slop down with her other books and this one was really the topping on the cake.I couldn't even read the whole book. I gave up about chapter 6 and skipped to the end. I just kept hoping the story would get better but it didn't. I am disappointed I wasted money as well as time on this. The female lead was mainly the reason I couldn't force myself to read. She is ridiculous and weeps over everything. She knows the guy a few days, meets his son and is in tears because the son doesn't like her? She acts like a child instead of a 37 year old women. I honestly can't understand how the main male lead (who is in his late 40's) dealt with her.In short: Don't waste your time/money!"
5,i love men in kilts,"i loooooooooooooooooooooooooooove this book. the whole story is like an exact fantasy of mine right down to the sheep. i don't know why i've always wanted to run a sheep farm but i do. so, now that i've read this book i'm determined that i will do nothing else with my life but search for a scottish sheep farmer because of course, like most american women...kilts make me hott!!!"
1,Put this book back and walk away,Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of Katie's work but for some reason I could not get into this story. And I tried. Three times. I tried reading this novel on three different occasions and all three times I couldn't get past the middle of the book. It was definitely not on par with her other novels. I was disappointed and maybe in the future if I find myself extremely bored I'll try reading it again -- but I don't hold my breath. The problem? I couldn't connect with the heroine. In this day and age the story line just isn't believable (and this after I've read Katie's paranormal stuff). This book is a swing and a miss. Move further down the row and buy something else Katie has written.
1,Not nearly as good as I expected,"This has the same issues I had with her first one - the man is great, the female protagonist is whiny,unlikeable and doesn't seem to have a life outside living for and on Iain. The first book was funny - this started out that way but at the end it was a chore to read. Try Jennifer Crusie or Jane Heller for more laughs or Carly Phillips or Rachle Gibson for strong heroines."
2,Could have been good...,"I've found this author to be hit or miss. In this case - a miss. The story sounded funny - writer travels to England for a writer's conference and falls for a Scot. However, from the beginning, the main character was just plain annoying. For the majority of the story, she whined. It was all about her. Even when verbally attacked by various characters, she had very little back-bone. I forced myself through the first half of the book and then just skipped to the last few chapters. The book was just dragging and I wanted to finish it. However, as I said, I've found this author to be hit or miss. Her series about Aisling Grey is great - funny and an enjoyable read."
3,Had flaws.,"I actually stumbled across this game at Target (I was originally going to but LOTR: Return of the King for PC) and bought it for 10 bucks. At the time, I thought it was an awesome game. Looking back, however, the game now seems a little...whats the word? Lacking? Disappointing? Anyway, it's basically a direct port of he Gamecube version. Not nearly as good, unless you play this game with a game pad, where it becomes at least acceptable.Also, there was an INSANE amount of glitches in this game. Run over to where the parking garage connects to the Train Station in Station Square and spindash. If you did it right, you'll got through the wall.If you have a Gamecube, buy it for Gamecube. Even better, if you have a Dreamcast, buy the original game, Sonic Adventure, for Dreamcast."
3,Nothing special about this version of the game,"Its appears to be a port of the Gamecube version. Graphically it is different then the Gamecube version in certain aspects. The framerate is very jumpy unless you have a high end machine, there are camera bugs, (its not perfect) and the Game Gear mini games are not as smoothed out as they should be. They are too pixelated, even when you play in the original format mode (which is a reduced size image)I bought this because I wanted to play this game but did not have a Gamecube or Dreamcast.Ok for Sonic Fans, but the money should be on the Gamecube version if you have a Gamecube that is..."
3,a good book,A good general history of knights and horses. Not detailed enough for me personnally and a few points that I have to question as even being possible.
3,purchased by a recommendation,"unfortunately have not yet read this book, but respect the opinion ofperson who said it was good"
3,Not for absolute beginners,I got this book as a present & have been enjoying cooking recipes from it. The one large picture of the finished meal on top is pretty but not very helpful. I would have preferred (since I'm a beginner) if it would have showed pictures of the preparation.Other than that the instructions are clear and so far all the recipes I've done have been delicious.I would have wished that as a beginner it came with some help with basic cooking vocabulary and techniques. But then again I got it as a gift so *shrug*.
5,One of our favorite Christmas CDs,"I found this CD in the bargain bin at Circuit City in El Paso; paid $5 for it. That was probably the best $5 I ever spent. My wife and our two grown daughters both love this CD. It is the first Christmas CD we play every year and the one we have on when we decorate our tree. Amigos Del Mundo (Happy Christmas) sung by La Diferenzia and Mama's Boy by Joel Nava are especially well done. If you want a Chistmas CD with a recognizable but little bit different sound then A Tejano Country Christmas is the one you should get. The one I have is copyrighted in 1994; it is probably no longer being produced, but if you can find one, buy it. It's worth it!"
4,Una Fiesta Tejana!,"Seems like everybody find this disc in a bargain situation (for me, two bucks at a local odd lot store)! I definitely underpaid for it, though, as it has become a perennial favorite, getting many spins during November and December. The Tejano sounds of Freddy Fender and Flaco Jimenez as well az the Western swing of Rick Orozco get your feet moving. They blend well with the mellow bits, like Joel Nava's sweet retelling of the Nativity, ""Mama's Boy."" Especially lovely is La Diferenzia's ""Amigos del Mundo,"" a translation of John and Yoko's ""Happy Christmas."" Whether the lyrics are in Spanish or English, the music is rocking and touching!"
2,Paper Not Photo Quality,"I needed to print a bunch of DVD case inserts and ended up printing on both Fellowes (until I ran out) as well as this Memorex brand. While both brands are matte paper, the Memorex isn't photo quality making photos (and backgrounds) appear really dull and somewhat faded. The Fellowes is photo quality, absorbs ink better, and looks great. I haven't tried Avery, but they are generally 2-3 times more expensive than other brands. Unfortunately I can't find Fellowes paper on Amazon so I'll need to look elsewhere."
2,Poor Print Quality,"These Memorex DVD Case Inserts were a disappointment. I tried these with an ink jet printer and the print quality was really bad. I even tried it on the ""Best Quality"" setting on my printer and the image was faint and smeary. If you are looking for ""Photo Quality"" print results, don't purchase these. Amazon offers another ""no name"" brand of DVD Case inserts that are outstanding and they are the same price as these ""name brand"" inserts."
2,Not what expected,I bought this so that I could create covers for my slim DVD cases. The size wasn't correct and still had to cut them. It would have been better is access to a template was available for this size.
2,Not good for slim cases,"The packaging said good for slim and standard DVD cases. Maybe I missed something, but it only fits the standard case size. Unless you remove the spine, but why on earth would anyone want to create a credible looking DVD slip cover with no spine? I looked all over the packaging for the slip cover dimensions but it is not included anywhere. I supposed I could just buy the standard DVD casing but having purchased Memorex's clear slim cases I'm a little annoyed."
2,Not very clear printing on this paper,"I like that the sheets are perferated for easy triming, but the picture quality of the paper was not good and I ended up using photo paper to make my lables instead of this product."
4,dvd inserts,This product was adaquate. I wish the paper was just a little thicker. But for the price they were ok.
3,25 pack huh?,I purchased the 50 pack quite a while ago and the stock was much thicker. My main complaint is quality control. Of 6 packages I purchased I found one with only 23 sheets and 3 with 24 sheets. Those deficiencies certainly can add up.
3,Mediocre & a hassle for Mac users,"Considering it is just a DVD insert for a family project, I was a bit upset that I had to search the internet for hours to find a Mac template and then download. (When I purchased this I was hoping to simply design and print from Microsoft Word.)I haven't finished designing and printing yet, but to assist furture Mac purchasers here is the link to download the free templates software: [...]"
1,Memorex software good (or bad?) for your neck muscles,"This product is a sad joke. It's expensive of course. The paper is just heavyweight paper that's perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves... which takes some effort (not sure if it'd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board). But, whatever.However, the software is crap. That's the appropriate term. Reading this I can save you an hour of your precious time. No you can't make the template show right-side up. That's right... to use the software you have to TILT YOUR HEAD SIDEWAYS. I'm not kidding! I guess you could also turn your monitor on it's side. You can rotate the text so it shows the way it should. But when you edit it, it'll be sideways again. So you'll have to turn your head (or monitor) back and forth sideways. What kind of company would sell such a product?And oh yeah... if you're looking for templates for the DVD Inserts? ... nada. They're not there!"
2,Material OK but the software is terrible,"These labels are of good quality and the print on them is OK.But the program that comes with the package is horrible. It is antiquated, inflexible, and downright poorly designed. You have to view the page sideways, there is no align feature ... the list goes on and on.If you want to use these inserts, be prepared to use a program like power point and spend the time to measure the paper to align it on the page yourself. The software that comes with this package sure isnt going to do the job right."
5,Looking for the best? Look no further,I develop DVDs for my customers and used to purchase DVD case inserts in bulk. Then I tried Memorex's product and was sold on it. They print up nicely (I use a color laser printer). Perhaps the best part of these inserts is that they are consistently well perforated so that they separate very cleanly from the waste trim. The other product I used to use would have to be trimmed to clean up the edge of the paper. You won't be disappointed with this product.
2,flat - low contrast,The images are dull (flat - low contrast) looking. You're better off using ink jet photo paper.
1,Avoid Memorex at all costs,"Yet another horrible Memorex product, designed to just waste your money (and INK!). The covers will NEVER EVER line up with any other standard DVD case insert template, You''ll waste a ton more money trying after you've been bilked buying this crappy product.Memorex really should be put up on fraud charges for the endless bunk DVD-Rs, CD-Rs, labels, tapes ect ect they've bamboozled people with over the years. No more."
1,False advertisement not compatible with MAC,"I bought this last minute to finish a DVD of prior Christmas's for my family as a present. To cut through the chase the product spec states that the software is compatible with Mac however it is not. Not only that you have to download the software to because it doesn't come with it. $15.00 for paper that fits a DVD case, I may be in the wrong business. I am returning this today."
4,Decent paper Great price,"The picture shows the ""older"" inserts so I bought these as I know they work well. I was sent the newer version of these DVD inserts and they are much thinner. The print quality is similar. There may be better inserts out there, but for the price these are a deal."
3,Works both REGULAR 14mm and 7mm,"Hello people! First let me tell you that this item. This works well with the regular DVD case and SLIM DVD case, yes you read it right it works with slim DVD cases as well BUT okay, but since it originally made for 14 mm or regular DVD cases and in order to make it work for the slim DVD cases is all you have to do is CUT, yes cut the spine..which for me still looks great and there is a pre cut lines for you to do that :) so I put 20 pieces of slim DVD cases without the use of a scissors... So there hope I made some help for telling you my experience today! Have a great day! :)"
1,Outdated and Disappointing,"Traveled in Costa Rica a month ago with this book and was very disappointed. The information in the book is badly outdated. My travel companion had the Lonely Planet Guide to Costa Rica, which was much better. My advice is to go with the LP Guide to Costa Rica"
2,Returning travel guide,"If there was ever a travel guide that was boring, this has to be it. Most guides have some type of color in them as well as better maps. I could see the pages easily tearing or getting worn on a trip. Tons of reading, but unable to quickly find necessary information. We really need a DK Eyewitness Guide for Costa Rica, maybe the DK guides are not as comprehensive, but it sure is easy to find information quickly."
4,Take this book with you.,Very helpful book! It was 1 of 6 books I bought to help me decide whether I wanted to live in Costa Rica for retirement. It was very comprehensive and 1 of my favorites with up to date information.
4,Take it,"I used 4 books on my 2-week trip (Fodor's, Rough Guide, Lonely Planet, and Moon). Moon was the most comprehensive (it should be, at twice the size of the other books!) and down-to-earth, and had good maps. Fodor's was the best for practical information and has the next-most-extensive hotel and restaurant reviews (after Moon), but not as many choices. Lonely Planet had decent maps and wildlife info, but I found it hard to navigate. RG was pretty useless and out of date and difficult to navigate---used it only as a backup to double-check maps and other information from the other books. The worst thing about Moon was its lack of practical information and the fact that lots of stuff was outdated. Some of the advice was sketchy---like how to look for ""love beneath the palms."""
5,Good introduction to Derrida,"Even though I've a good grasp of other difficult continental philosophers (important influences on Derrida) such as Hegel and Heidegger, I still felt a barrier to 'getting' deconstruction. This book helps to clarify the gist of textual deconstruction and Derrida's implicit political motives. I've come to the conclusion that much of the 'barrier' to understanding Derrida has to do with problems in his (anti-)philosophy, which come to light, for instance, by comparing his work with that of Deleuze who also develops a ""philosophy of difference,"" yet without avoiding the question of substance which contemporary thought must address anew. I had read other 'introducing..' type books, but most of them simplify the material too much. For the dillegent, focused reader, this book yields a good middle way to comprehension between Derrida's daunting original texts and other introductory books."
2,Iconic,"Only one or two decent, yet massively corny tunes...BUT...this was, and remains a cultural ""straddle"" and iconic album. Cliff Richards does do decent music and for those of us in our 60's, and raised in former British colonies he has a very special place in our youthful hearts!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This is a sad attempt at a western novel. It was not worth the time to read it, please do not waste your time on it."
1,Flash back to the early 90's,This book is very outdated. If you're a modern bride this is not the book for you; unless you want a good laugh!
5,Lighsticks,"These work just as described, and react for a decent amount of time (throughout the evening and into the next morning).I didn't have any leakage problems whatsoever, and they held up well even though my nephews kept tossing them up into the air.One thing to note is that these are 4"" and not 6"" sticks."
4,Good fun for a great price,We bought these for our Christmas Eve Service at our church. The kids loved it! The price is great - I believe all the sticks lit as expected. Great fun for little kids!
5,Very good book for theologians to have,This is a very good dictionary for anyone that calls himself or herself a theologian or who studies or teaches theology at any level.
4,Ignore the cheesy cover illustration.,This book is fine. It covers all four voyages and gets into Columbus's personality. Read aloud to younger kids and let the big kids (3rd grade?) handle it on their own.
5,Great series.,"Warning: watch one episode of SOA and you will be hooked. My mom, husband, daughter and I are all addicted to this show. It's funny, has an excellent plot, very well written, and keeps you on the edge of your seat."
3,Another sensational season,"I originally watched the first few episodes of Season 1 on Netflix, but I got so hooked on this show that I found myself ordering Seasons 1 through 4. I have not been disappointed. This show is amazing."
5,Just plain addictive.,"I really can't say much. Watch the show from the start of season one, and you will know why it's just plain addictive."
1,Sons of anarchy,The show is great but with this online viewing every 3 seconds it pauses and says loading for 10 seconds REALLY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Horrible Service!!!!!!!!,I have ordered The second season of Sons of Anarchy DVD set December 13 and have still not received the DVD!!! I have emailed them over 6 times and NO RESPONSE!!!!! I would not do business with this company again!!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!!! If I could give negative stars i would!!!! they don't even deserve a star!
1,The discs are not right.,"I purchased Season 1 and 2 of this product. Each episode was separated on the disc. Not so on the Season 3 disc. I either had to watch all 4 eposodes at once or spend time fast forwarding through the disc to the next episode.I do not know if I received a bad set or if they all are like that.I like being able to watch a couple episodes and stopping to see the rest at a later date.On the episode selection part of the discs, the only one listed was the first episode on the disc. The rest were not mentioned. They were on the tape, just had to go from beginning to end. Four hours is a long time to watch TV for me.I buy disc sets so that I can watch at my leisure, but not to spend time fast forwarding through the disc.I want a set like disc 1 and 2."
2,great dvd,Great season. Quality of dvd great. Plays fine no issues. I am pleased with dvd itself. Just will never reorder from amazon again. Almost took full year 2 get this dvd from them. I could have gone to walmart and not only.purchased cheaper but gotten month's sooner.
4,Forget Ireland,"I loved every episode of all the Sons' series, except Ireland. I wish they would take a road trip up to the redwoods."
1,Poor Quality DVD,"Enjoy the series and received the product timely, but poor quality DVD. Picture is very dark, stalls continuously and digitally broken up. Contacted the seller and they have not responded, it has been over a month and no reply."
3,received item in good condition,I haven't watched it yet but it wasn't damaged. I assume it works fine. Will order more in the future if this item is in good working condition.
3,It finished strong,I generally like this show but the whole trip to Ireland spoilt the story for me b/c it was not convincing. The image portrayed of NI appeared to belong to th 70s and not the first decade of the 21st century. Clearly hey did not have the budget to really go to Ireland. Once the boys returned to charming the story became more believable.
5,SONS IT'S A GREAT SHOW,I downloaded it from Amazon & loaded it onto my TIVO. Works nice and cheaper than buying the DVD. Will buy the next season when it comes out.
3,okay but not what i expected,"I bought a DVD (tv show) that was labeled as new but it wasn't. It clearly was used and pretty much should have said like new. The packaging was done where now I have sticky adhesive on the outside of the case because it wasn't in its original packaging and now sticks to my other DVDS. I checked the discs just to make sure. Most of them were fine but one of them had tiny scratches on it while the other disc had a very noticeable scratch on it that my roommate took off with scratch remover which created other small scratches. I played the disc and it was fine for the first ten or so minutes and probably is for the rest of the disc. It takes too much time to send it back, but I give it only three stars."
2,"OK season, does not play well","I only bought the season because my fiance wants to have them all. It was ok, but not great. Overall, my big issue is that the set I got takes literally about half an hour to load on our blu-ray player. I don't need an update or anything, and nothing else plays that poorly. It's really frustrating, because I bought it full price and it feels like a waste of money."
3,SOA,I received the package on time and intact. The only problem was I ordered season 4 and I received season 3! :-( in order to return it I have to pay for shipping! Which doesn't make sense to me so ill just buy season 4 at a later date. Stinks that I have 2 copies of season 3 though!! :-(
5,SoA season 3,very good season. Jax's and the club are in search of Jackson's son. the search will take the MC to Ireland were they learn so horrible truths about IRA the Irish branch of the SOA and the Tellers path. This season also has one of the most dramatic endings since the death of Donna in Season 1
1,the dvd didnt work,dvd didnt work waste of money tried to resolve situation nevr got any help it was thru a 3rd party
5,excellent,Item is just as described. New in box. It arrived quickly and I am very happy with it. Thank you!
5,Sons of Anarchy: Season 3,Awesome!! We have been following this show and was happy when finally got! This is a great show we like to watch over and over!!
5,Fantastic!!,This series just keeps getting better every year. I can't get enough of the edgy drama and riveting story lines.
5,what can I say,with no cable in our area its nice to catch up on S.O.A. we love this show.. and the twists and turns to it. Love Jacks and the plot. awesome
5,LOVE IT,Great way to watch an episode if missed on television. Love Sons of Anarchy and will continue to use this service if a show is missed.
5,The show speaks for itself awesome!,adults would love the show keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what is going to happen next!
1,Disc skip,Three of the discs skipped several times each it was tough to follow along with the story and enjoy the series.
5,Addictive,I bought this and season one and season two for a Christmas gift for my daughter and she LOVES them all!
2,freeze up,this is the third sons of anarchy season 3 that i have bought and all three of them freeze up.is this a normal problem for season 3?
1,DVD unwatchable,"This dvd was in unbelievably bad condition. It had scratches and pock marks all in it, and was absolutely unwatchable. I am currently deployed in Afghanistan, and the down time I do get, I try to enjoy shows from home, but this product just caused my stress level to increase. I've ordered many dvd's through the mail, and this was the first time I received one in this kind of condition. Completely unacceptable."
5,soa season 3,needless to say it is the best show that has ever been on tv period it is awsome i have watched seasons 1 and 2 over and over just dont ever get enough of it
5,Series just keeps getting better and better,"These guys are crazy. I caught the first 2 seasons on Netflix, and was hooked after that. An outlaw biker gang with no regard for the law in small town Charming, California. Lots of twists and turns, secrets, hidden agendas... everything that makes up a good series."
5,Purchased as gift but not viewed,Hard to review something I have not watched and probably won't watch. The recipient loves it though. No product issue
5,TV worth watching,This is a really good series to watch. Great plot line that keeps me looking for more! Hope this series never ends
3,"Overall, the worst season","This season had it's moments but overall, it was by far my least favorite. Thankfully, Sutter came back very strong with Season 4, which I find is the best yet. The Ireland deal was really drug out for too long. It wasn't hard to see why this season wasn't nominated for anything. It's still one of the best on T.V. so it's easy to forgive this glitch."
5,Sons of Anarchy: Season Three,"Another amazing season of Sons! Jax keeps getting better looking! ""Sit on the edge of your seat season"" Once you start watching SOA, you'll be hooked! Looking forward to 4th Season!"
4,Season 3 is addicting!,"If you're watching season 3, you already know. This show is addicting. I couldn't put it down. I wish the motorcycles got more screen time than they do... but then again it's not really a show about motorcycles is it.HD quality is good, no problem streaming it."
5,I just love this show!,Engaging as always! This service is super easy to use and extremely convenient. My only issue is that the cost is a little pricey. I think a dollar an episode is fair.
2,disc2,"Sons of Anarchy: Season ThreeItem arrived in good time, and was given as a gift. The recipient of it could ot get disc 2 to work...citing faulty disc."
4,Sons of Anarchy season 3,"Great show, good characters with a different kind of plot. Worth watching, just wish I could. Very low quality supplied and one episode jumps to the end half an hour in. Must say this is the first problem I have had with Amazon, usualy their stuff is better"
1,Disappointing,"In this book the author reviews many IDEAS involving LEAPS but in my opinion none of them are covered in enough detail to stand alone as full fledged strategies.For example the topic of using LEAPS as a substitute for stocks in a covered call strategy only gets maybe 8 or 9 pages in this book. I have read other books where almost 100 pages are devoted to this strategy alone.The author is also flat out wrong about one thing:Page 251....""Many index options, however, are traded using the European Style rules. Under that system, positions cannot be closed or sold before expiration""Oops I hope that's just a typo."
5,This is one of those albums that will be in your CD player for a loooooooooong time!,"The Anti-Nowhere League is another great classic band and this is a great place to start off with. every song on this album is excellent. The League's goal in the beginning was to make the worst album ever written. even though this is a very excellent album, lyrically, some of you might think that the lyrics are dumb or doesn't make sense. If you like british punk that came from the side of the Clash (Crass, Conflict, Rudimentary Peni, etc. because this was the band that they were influenced by.), then you might want to stay away from this."
5,"Classic, filthy, funny Oi!","ANL was one of the dirtiest, most wrotten bands in the English Punk Scene of the 1980s. Musically, they were right up there with the likes of the 4-Skins and Cockney Rejects, as they produced some of the loudest, most aggressive Oi! tracks ever. Lyrically, the band was funnier, and dirtier than most bands at the time, or even today! The band wasn't without their politically or socially conscience side, as seen in tracks like ""Streets of London"" or the added track ""Ballard of J. J. Decay."" But the band is, and should be, best remembered for tracks like ""Woman,"" a rude anti-love song, ""Animal,"" a self-loathing number, and probably my favorite ""So What?"" which is all about being the most disgusting, anti-bragging song ever. A classic album for fans of Macc Lads, Cockney Rejects, or the Exploited."
3,Rubbish really.,"Rubbish really, but worth it for ""woman"" and ""So What"" which are amusing to hear again."
4,My friends uncle is in this band,"I am a guitarist and I jam with this kid named Pash who plays drums. It just so happens his uncle plays drums in Anti-Nowhere League. I have listened to most of this album and damn, this is what punk is meant to sound like."
2,Sunset Curtaiins,The written directions were not always clear. The illustrations did not correspond to the written notations. I was unable to use this book when making my lined drapes. I had to resort to another source.
5,window treatments,"This is a very good ""how-to"" book for someone wanting to do their own window treatments. It gives ideas and instructions on how to make what you see."
1,Very dated and old looking,"This book is old, I found. It shows too many ideas that are not current. The how-to is OK, but there are newer books around that do the job better."
4,I recommend this book..,"It was first published over five years ago, but the styles in this book haven't been outdated by any means. If you are looking for popular looks for any size window, then this is the book to get. It includes an assortement of cornices, draperies of all kinds, swags, curtains, roman shades, ect., with easy to follow sewing and building instructions. I made one from this book already, I am in the middle of making another, and plan on making at least one more. This book doesn't give useless information, everything from the beginning of the book to the last page can be put to use, which is not true about a lot of books...some window treatement books seem to contain a lot of nice pictures and photography, but nothing you'd really want to use."
3,Not for Beginners,"I found this book to be very difficult to follow. The writers assumed a certain amount of prior knowledge of both ""sewing jargon"" and technique. The window coverings were also quite complicated. For a true beginner, I would recommend ""Window Basics"" by Better Homes and Gardens."
4,untitled,"Enlarged and reinforced my appreciation of ""Absalom, Absalom!"". However, it also raised some questions. Why is Sutpen so abhorred at the taint of black blood in his line? Presumably all he wants is the big plantation, money, power, wealth. And Faulkner indicates he was raised in West Virginia with no prejudice against blacks, in a slaveless world. He of all people should stand outside this. Yet we first see him with blacks as his property."
4,"Good, but not excellent","This covers most aspects of microeconomics, but with a drawback of lacking details. I think the use of calculus should be incorporated in the main text, not just at the back of the chapters, and i need to refer to his graduate text Microeconomics Analysis for advanced topics. The writer has done an excellent job in explaining economic concepts. Clear, simple. Another good microeconomics text may be price theory and application by Hirshleifer. Also a very good book, but different focus."
5,We loved the Boppy!,My husband and I loved the Boppy because it allows you and your baby to be comfortable during feedings. The boopy positions the baby close to you and provides great support for the baby. This way you can enjoy bonding with your new child instead of struggling to hold him properly. It is a must have weither you're breast feeding or bottle feeding. We are now using it to teach our son to sit up. I will definitely purchase this for future baby shower gifts!
4,An answer to my breastfeeding frustrations!,My son was premature and trying to breastfeed him on stacked up pillows was a nightmare. He would slip off easily and never could get a good latch on. Within hours of using the boppy he was feeding with no trouble at all. The positioning is perfect and it takes the strain off of my arms. I do agree though about two thing people have said. It does sit a little low and I still have to prop his head up with a pillow even though I am a DD. I am of course tall though so this might be why. Also I recommend buying the naked bobby as well and not investing in all of the slipcovers. It is just another thing to get dirty and wash. Plus putting it into the cover is not the easiest thing either.
4,Love the boppy,I don't use the boppy for nursing but it did save my arms holding the baby all the time. I just put it on and rested the baby on there and we could sit comfortably for hours.
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"It seems like everyone has this pillow, so I figured it must be helpful. During the first few weeks of breastfeeding, I tried to use it to help support the baby. The pillow didn't hold the baby high enough and I had to use another pillow underneath to raise it to the right level. Both pillows were constantly slipping and I'd end up just holding the baby entirely in my arms. I've heard good things about My Brest Friend and wish I'd tried that instead. I don't even like it for napping so now it just sits around taking up room."
3,Im a big Boppy fan but...............,"Boppys can get dirty easy (breastmilk, formula can stain) and I have found that owning a boppy is easier and better on the wallet to buy the bare naked boppy and then buying the various slipcovers for it. its a nice change and its so much easier to wash. I have owned the baby bees boppy and then after it was damaged in the washer a friend bought me the bare naked boppy and I love that one so much better the cleaning is so much easier and the neat thing is there are alot of boppy slipcover prints (different baby stores carry different prints)The ones that carry boppy slipcovers are Babies r us, Target, Baby Depot and Toysrus."
3,Brest Friend is better,I didn't find the Boppy useful for breast feeding. I found that it would slip off my waist. The Brest Friend has a strap that keeps it secure around your waist. I do think the Boppy is useful to prop baby up on though.
4,Great Item,Really helps with breastfeeding. Baby is so comfortable resting on pillow instead of arm. Also great to sit baby up on while folding laundry or straightening up the room. Cover is easy to remove to throw in the wash. Only problem with mine is defective zipper on cover.
4,Boppy is good,"I like my Boppy a lot. I haven't found it very useful in breastfeeding, really. I prefer a feather pillow or a thick blanket. But my post-delivery time was made better by Boppy. I used it to sit on, and it was a tremendous relief. I also like to prop my baby up on the Boppy. He tends to get reflux, and keeping him inclined helps a lot. For $35 I've found it a lifesaver."
4,Good Prodcuts - Some minor flaws,"I didn't use this for a week or so because the Lactation Consultants (I saw 3 of them in the hospital) felt like a pillow was just fine. But after I got home and becoming frustrated with the pillows, I pulled this out and have used it ever since. I love it! But after washing it a couple of times, the zipper ran of the track and I had to have my DH fix it. Also, I'm noticing where the seams are already coming apart. I've only washed it 3 times!!!"
4,Nice supportive pillow,"I like the boppy. It's a great support pillow for my baby. It's not that great for nursing--the brest friend works better. But the boppy is nice for keeping the baby upright after feedings, and for tummy time too. I'm glad I got this pillow."
4,"Glad you're here, Jerrilyn",The previous books in this series were all enjoyable and this one was no exception! They could only take place in the company town known as Tinseltown so Jerrilyn Farmer will be able to keep us entertained for a good long time!
5,fourth in this charming culinary mystery series is delicious,"Event planner Madeline Bean and her partner Wesley are again surrounded by mysteries, mayhem and celebrity sightings in this fourth instalment to Farmer's charming series of culinary mysteries.This time Hollywood insiders are enraptured with mah-jongg as the partners prepare a dim sum Chinese New Year feast, and the clues to a murder are scattered among Hollywood's oldest secrets. Along the way, you learn about the origins of dim sum, the significance of particular mah-jongg tiles, how to make an authentic Singapore Sling, and the correct way to greet a star.Madeline's personal life is realistic without detracting from the story, and the story is interesting right away and paced well. The mystery is well-integrated but not transparent. The dialogue is fun, and the characters are likeable. This is a lively mix of Hollywood dish, mouth-watering recipes and the Perils of Pauline. Quite fun. Well-written. Looking forward to the next one."
4,Whoah! The Madster finally gets her man!,"Fans of this series will need to get this book and will not be disappointed. Farmer is back on form. Lots of cooking going on, lots of devilish deeds and, finally, our heroine finally advances her thang with that good looking cop. This book has everything, it was a totally fab read."
4,Good little morsel,This book will keep you turning the pages to find out who did it! Drop into the world of aging Hollywood starlets and the new craze of Mah Jong. Sweet little mystery with an upbeat undertone.
4,This is a must have in our house,"Like many others, we had an issue with diaper leakage even with overnight huggies. In fact, this became so much of an issue that it turned into a sleeping problem, too! Son would call for me at night (2 years old) and say ""all wet"" - I'd have to change him and was too tired to change his sheets, too, so would have him in our bed. I tried many solutions but in the end, this one worked for us. I use two at night and only have occassional leaks (mostly because of where I might place the pads if there is leakage). Otherwise we have dry nights.I tried Poise pads and feminie pads. They are designed NOT to leak so it would not overflow into the diaper. With these pads you get the diaper absorbency AND the pads. They take up liquid then go through to the diaper.It is a must have for now!"
4,Diaper liners,We bought these because the diaper booster pads by tranquility were not available anywhere. These work well the adhesive like ona female sanitary pad is not necessary. Great absorption keeps baby and crib dry all night!
5,Fun and interesting!,Ever curious about the history of quirky stuff? This book is loaded with interesting facts about a topic rarely discussed in Western Civ 101! It's funny and true all at the same time! You'll be surprised how hard it is to put down!
5,Funny and Factual!,"Really enjoyed this quick reading book...lots of trivia presented in a witty, funny yet informative way. This book would make a great gift for girlfriends or your lover."
5,Dirty Little Secrets - Fast and Fun,"Orloff does it again.This book is a gem and a fun gift for anyone with a secret or not-so-secret love. Additionally, I learned a great deal of fun facts and tidbits (and didn't expect to!).Kudos. A great gift for someone special -- yourself or another. I highly recommend it."
5,Clearly the best book on dressage in a long time,"Kyra writes as clearly as she teaches and rides. Her explanations are logical and simple, but not simplistic! This is a great aid for understanding dressage and the perspective of the horse."
1,overrated,"I have read 'Dressur Med Kyra' (in both Danish and Swedish). I doubt this translation will improve upon it. Clearly - I have been told -- Kyra is an excellent instructor. This book (written together with a colleague of Kyra) is more of a showcase thing. I'd stick with Podhasky, la Guérinière, or Müseler (if you can get a hold of a copy). Most dressage and horsemanship (some arguably so) books at ... are getting the 4-5 star treatment. Every book has its fans. This rating, though, would be very misleading regarding Kyras book."
5,Core book for your riding collection,"This was recomened by my Instuctor.I have always enjoyed articles about her clinics and demostations,I'm also a Show jump rider so the princles are not the dutch fashionable ones. Well written good photos."
5,Thoughtful Personal Dressage Training,"Kyra is a well respected and admired champion international dressage trainer and competitor. Her admiration of horses comes through in this book, while still being very technical. Kyra talks not only about how to train dressage horses, but why we train them in certain ways.Kyra goes into a lot of detail about the aids she uses while riding. I like this personal perspective. She also addresses how she prefers to start teaching the most advanced movement, piaffe, showing in hand work. Very nice.Towards the end of the book, Kyra talks about dressage training vs competition, including mental preparation for competition. This, for me, was a pivotal chapter, changing how I personally approach dressage competitions.This is a thoughtfully written book and easy to read. I think dressage trainers and riders will truly enjoy it."
1,In A Narrow Grave,"Larry McMurtry's only great works was Lonesome Dove. He is very narrow minded. In my opinion, he abused his readership just because he had a successful novel in Lonesome Dove. He is a very negative person and offers nothing of positive influence in A Narrow Grave or any of his other publishings except Lonesome Dove. Larry McMurtry is prejudiced to all people from the south just because one southerner ""offended"" him. I reget wasting my money on any of his other ""works"". He reminds me of Steinbeck. Steinbeck's only greatness was Grapes of Wrath, yet he was considered a literary giant because he published so many other books."
3,"Silly, Cute, Perfect for Toddlers",Older children might not enjoy this as much as toddlers. It is very silly. My 18 month old begs me to play this video for her and she is the true critic. She loves it!
3,spanish verb handbook,"Excellent book for serious students of Spanish, as it lays out all the verbs and in an orderly fashion. However, you need to be a good enought student to know what the tenses mean, as there is no English equivalent given for the Spanish. Good teaching tool."
1,Poor,"Berlitz publishs ""Spanish Verb Handbook ""and ""Spanish Grammar Handbook "" .Beware : The exact same text is used for about 50 % of each of these titles . A very crude 'marketing' effort by Berlitz .Of the two , I like the ""Spanish Verb Handbook"" better . My mistake was to buy both . Then I found out how much I had been cheated ! All the material in both books would fill one modest title .Berlitz = bad value ."
4,Political Threat,"A heart gripping, eye watering, investigation about two innocent victims tortured and put to death by political powers. This detective story raises many important issues about political abuse and political lies that have been recently common in the United States of America, ""the land of the free."" One of the most significant issues in the story is about enforcing laws that hurt not only the ones being tortured and killed but also the entire society who becomes captive of its government through fear. This is a very strong and powerful story, complete with excitement, suspense, drama, comedy and love; making it a great combination to facilitate the introduction of important issues and at the same time keep the reader intrigued while using humor and love to lighten-up the tension of the reader."
4,Waking Up,"""A Dry White Season"" is a classic South African novel. The story is set in the 1970s, during the police crackdown after the Soweto riots. The ""hero"" is a mild-mannered Afrikaner schoolteacher who wakes up to the real conditions in South Africa when his school's black gardener dies in police custody. The teacher sets out to investigate the death, only to draw the attention of the police and the ire of his family and colleagues, who don't understand why he wants to ""cause trouble."" The book brilliantly links the personal and the political, but it isn't merely a ""political"" novel. Rather, it's a close examination of what it means to see the world through the lens of an aroused conscience. As such, ""A Dry White Season"" is a rarity -- a page-turner that grips the reader while also making him think hard about personal accountability in the face of injustice and corrupt institutions. Fans of Graham Greene will love it."
1,Will not play in USA.,This is a European DVD and will not work for me. Completely useless in the USA. Will try to return it.
2,weird,"Well.....I like this author, who is definitely not a normal person. And this book is really strange. I got into Robbe Grillet based on something James Sallis wrote (I think Sallis is terrific) and have enjoyed several of his books, but this one is really strange. Some people might think it is pornographic, perhaps both an attraction and the opposite, but I think it is so strange even that aspect becomes ephemeral. Anyway, not my favorite, and I am a broad reader with a high tolerance for weird writing."
3,A controversial book,"""The Malay Dilemma"" resulted in a political problem at the time it was published. It gave a somewhat biased, although not entirely inaccurate, picture of Malaya?Malaysia from the Malay point of view, with some arguable opinions."
1,Disapointed,"What a shame. Dianne Reeves may have the best voice in jazz today, but in this CD every song is over produced, arranged, and most sadly, oversung. Anyone who has listened to Ms. Reeves sing knows she has great vocal ability, but it feels like this is an attempt to see how stylized and how much vocal gymnastics she can wow us with. From the original songs (which are awful and should never be a part of the best of, to the couple of standards which again are over arranged (and over the top with vocalization), this CD was totally disapointing. You want to hear the best of Diane Reeves, get the soundtract to ""Good Night and Good Luck"" as this is truley an artist at the top of her vocal game with great arrangments of wonderful songs."
5,It's amazing How She is Ignored,"I remember back in the day My Best Friend told Me about Her.He was like this Woman Named Dianne Reeves has Stevie WOnder driving Her Taxi in a Video&Larry Dunn from Earth,Wind&Fire is in the Video so I was Like Yo I gotta Peep this out.also Dude was like this Song is About Her Grandmother so I had to Hear it.sure enough I was Moved&since then I buy all Her Stuff.She has a Very Moving way with Her Material.to Me all this talk about Neo-Soul etc... Artists&Material Dianne Reeves deserve far Better Respect as a Artist."
5,Exceptional!,"This is an incredible introduction to economic history. It is clearly written, and it is easy for the non-economist to read and enjoy. If you have any interest in economic history, then this is a must read."
4,college textbook,"My son needed this textbook for a college class. It arrived really fast, in good condition, as advertised and saved us over $100. compared to the school bookstore price."
3,good,"My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could add it to the collection he plans to take on his cruise around the world."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is budget movie, so expecting anything extrodinary would be wrong.Overall, it has a few laughs, but the movie starts to wear thin by the halfway point. By the end I was just thankfull it was over. It was like watching a low budget TV show; which is really what this movie should have been."
4,4.5 out of 5 stars,"4.5 out of 5 stars. Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun. Clean & for the whole family. Play find the homage to your favorite movies & tv series. Also, stick around thru the end of the credits for an additional scene. Thanks, from me, to all the people who allowed them to use your stuff or parody them. Helped make it great. Honestly, I bought the movie because of Danielle, whom I met back in March @ Horror Hound Weekend. She was really sweet so I am slowly buying her stuff. I was expecting a kids movie. However, it turned into more of a movie like FANBOYS for me. Enjoy."
3,"Decent Book, Especially for the Low Price","To cut to the chase, this book has some interesting pictures and covers every song by the Police and into Sting's solo career up to _Ten Summoner's Tales_. Some photos are in color, but most are in b/w. Each section describes another album, when the album was released, what songs you'll find on it and what kind of reviews it received. The main thing I disliked about this book was the frequent commentary of the author regarding the meaning of songs. Sometimes we agreed, sometimes we didn't, but I would have been happier with more Sting quotes, more facts and less editorializing by the author. All things considered though, the affordable price makes this title worth buying."
4,Review of service,The service in getting this book to me was superior. It arrived before I expected and was in the condition as advertised. Thanks.
2,Interesting,"What happened was perfectly natural, but who would of ever believed that the justice system would be so cruel. What has happned to America? It was just all in all to sad for anyone to want to finish this novel."
3,Tolerable...,"...but not much else. Its not BAD, and if this was Drowning Pool's only release I could maybe get into it, but its realy dwarfed by Sinner, their latest release. I'd say the best tracks on here are probably Ever Clear, and Maybe Cicada. But a lot of the rest isn't worth mentioning.Its OK, but it really looks poor measured up to Sinner. Buy this if you like the samples, they're a pretty good idea of what most of the album is about."
5,Humorous with just a touch of scientific research.,"This is a light and carefree look at the left handed world. It's a mixture of science (the brain's contribution - which now is known to happen much earlier than previously thought), culture (where to sit at a dining table), humor (as in left handed sword fighting), and a dose of I'm not sure just what to call it about stories such at one where a man had his left arm attached to his right shoulder (To move his thumb, his brain sends out signals to move his little finger. Question, is he left handed?).Mr. Wolman is a leftie, he took off a year to research leftiness. He lives in Portland, Oregon, which is just about as far left wing as any city in the country, besides being on the left hand side of the map. -- Sorry, I couldn't help it.An amusing book, potentially a very good gift for the right person, no I mean the left person, no that's not what I meant either."
5,Perfect Holiday Gift for A Lefty,"My dad is notoriously hard to shop for but this wonderful book is perfect. I read it first myself and loved it even though I'm a righty. It made me feel smarter - I think most people have probably been curious about what makes some people left handed, particullarly if they have lefties in their family. Well, this book reveals a lot, but you'll have to read it to learn for yourself. Anyway, I'm giving it to my dad because he's a lefty and will appreciate it. Sure makes my gift-giving easier this year!"
4,For low temperature experiments.,"This is the first book, I came across, in low temperature techniques. Useful for people carrying out low temperature experiments. This book does not deal with ultra low temperatures, that is temperatures below 1K, adequately. Does not write about the modern dilution refrigeratures. However, if one needs some low temperature technique information or low temperaure material data, then one can look in to this book. The book is very clearly written and still useful, although several new books on this topic have been published."
5,Swinging Christmas - Michael Bolton,"I had heard quite a bit about this CD from friends of how good it was and, after listening too, I can only agree with them - it is certainly up to the usual high standard of Michael Bolton. I feel it is a very nice mixture of traditional in ""White Christmas"" and ""Walking in a Winter Wonderland"" to the religious airs of ""Silent Night"" and ""Joy to the World"" to the more upbeat renditions of ""Jingle Bells"" and ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" - I feel it is pretty beautiful CD to play at Christmas time for all the family, for there is something for everyone on it !!"
2,Disposable electronics,"We enjoyed this TV while it worked. We purchased it in January 08, had to have a service tech come fix it right away and then had to wait for Hitachi to send a firmware upgrade before we could use it. Two years later, it plays for a minute then shuts off. Hitachi sent another firmware upgrade, but the power won't stay on long enough to do it. Now we have to pay for someone to come tell us whether it's worth fixing or just scrap it because it's not worth fixing. Too bad. I won't be buying another Hitachi, I would suggest the Sony Bravia which we've been much happier with the picture quality anyway. Customer service at Hitachi acts like they get calls about this all the time. Seemed to know what the problem was but didn't tell me."
4,Phenomenal Series. Season 6 is Mediocre.,"Quite possibly my favorite series of all time! Entourage is very entertaining.The product itself is flawless. The purchase through Amazon was top notch as usual.As for the rating of Season 6, I'd say the show is going down hill. The first few seasons are much better in my opinion, though still a must watch. For this, I give 'Entourage: The Complete Sixth Season' a 4 out of 5. Highly recommended."
3,Weakest Season so far,"I'm a huge fan of Entourage and have watched every season multiple times, however this season just seemed like it had no direction. Vincent Chase was on vacation the whole time with nothing really to do. E goes gaga over a girl who is, well to be nice, less then attractive. I got bored over Turtle's story arc and Drama didn't really make much of an impression this season until he ultimately gave up on his career at the end, which was one of the few highlights of the season. Since Vince wasn't working Ari had no one to rain his wrath upon so the writers dragged out Lloyd becoming an agent to give him something to scream about. All and all it was a lukewarm season, here's hoping they bring it back to its greatness next season."
3,"Good, but not great","The first few seasons of entourage were great, but then they just got progressively worse. Seasons four through six are good, but not as great as the first three."
3,Yet another okay season,"Some say this show is great, and even with the beautiful women and common drug use, I still can't get into it. Entourage is cast made up of a few D-list actors. You got Matt Dillon's less talented brother who was the drummer in The Doors, the kid from the Married With Children spin-off Unhappily Ever After, the bald guy who got a hair transplant and can't take sushi, the poor man's Benicio Del Toro, and some other actors I've never seen before. Ironically this cast who couldn't make it in Hollywood made a show about actors who struggle to make it in Hollywood, and voila now they are stars! Okay to watch if you don't have high expectations. Picture and sound meet the blu-ray standard, but I can't recommend buying- there's way better shows out there than this, with replay value."
2,Damaged Disc,Last disc of season skips and freezes from Episode 10 thru season finale. Quite a bummer when you get to the end of an amazing series and can't even get all the way to the finish :(
1,So bad I sold it 5 mins after I finished the Season,"I'm a huge Entourage fan, but I have to say this season was the worst. I own all of the seasons, but this one I just had to get out of my house. The quality was equivalent to DVD resolution, it wasn't sharp at all. Ari's character seems more mean than sarcastic and they even made Eric sound like Ari. Not for anything but there can only be one Ari Gold. This season pretty much set up future seasons of Entourage, but it could have been a little more dynamic. Eric finds himself struggling to get in Sloane's pants all season and also find's himself caught up with some little barely legal chick. I have to also say that the whole crew including Ari are not aging well at all. The previous seasons of Entourage have been pretty original and maybe they set the bar a little to high, but for now I have to say you maybe very disappointed."
2,Nothing really happens,"I've been a long follower for Entourage since the beginning and I have to say this particular season was the most disappointing of all. Nothing really happens, and with just 12 episodes it's quite disappointing. You're gonna $20-30 for this season and you'll finish watching the entire season in probably 2-3 days, and then you'll be thinking about selling it. It's a big waste of time.. although the final episode seemed interesting."
4,"Very satisfied, but....",The Z525a phhone is great the service so far is very good. The one thing that I was not happy with was the fact that as soon as I activated my phone I started getting a TON of calls. From people I didn't know. I assume that these were people that knew the previous owner of the cell number I got. But the constant calls and voice messages (some even insulting) from people I could care less for was a big downer. I was about to cancel the service ( 2 weeks later!) when the calls started to slow down and I still get one or two once in a while. But the fact that these people called me daily was a sing that who ever had this cell number had just released it! To me that was bad customer service for me and for the prvious owner! I thought that they would put a hold on the line for some time before giving it to someone else.Aside from that BIG issue! Everything else was OK.
4,Love country swing!,"""Boogie Woogie Choo-Choo Train"" introduced us to the Tractors. When their Christmas version came out we bought the CD version. My son asked for the CD for Christmas so he could have a copy of his own. We love the country swing."
5,SANTA LOOKS A LOT LIKE RIPLEY!!,"Tractors go Christmas in this, their first holiday release. ""Santa Looks A Lot Like Daddy"", ""Jingle My Bells"" andthe remake of Boogie Woogie Choo Choo Train as ""Santa Claus Is Comin"" ar worth the price of this CD alone.The Tractors are America's band-truly unique yet very much a part of what we all are. Shuffle on , Santa, shuffle on..."
3,Only a couple of good songs on the whole CD,"I was a bit disapointed to find only a couple of good songs on the CD. However, I will make a Christmas CD with a compilation of several good songs from this CD and others for my personal enjoyment."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is useless!Flash takes ages to load, in fact you must push the mode-button continiously for 20 times othervise it auto shuts!I have no idea what the quality of the pictures is since I can't download those. I do know a thing or two about cameras and computing, so I don't think it's a use based problem.USELESS! Don't waist your money on this"
1,Junk camera,"We bought this camera at the store. If we had read the reviews online, we wouldn't have bought it. It does take pictures. However, you can't download them at all. She's very disappointed. I heard that the Fisherprice camera is supposed to be good. So we're going to check the reviews of it."
2,Hello Kitty Camera,"Camera did not come with batteries, and you need a eyeglass screwdriver to open the battery compartment. And of course screw is super duper small so you better keep track of it in able to but it back in."
4,Definitely a great book...even for non-Montessorians,"This is a great read for anyone who wants guidance on how to raise their children. There are great tips on how to handle issues at bedtime, temper tantrums, and even just what children really need out of their environment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the book could include more; ideas on what ELSE to give your child when you see a pattern of interest. The book does a decent job in some cases, but I crave more. Perhaps I'm not being fair holding back that 5th star...it's more of a 4.5 star rating :)"
3,Expecting more,If you have read anything about Montessori you will be left wanting. It has nice pictures and very genral info but not much else.
4,Great Primer for Parents,"This is a wonderful book for parents of very young children (infants +) who want to begin setting up a Montessori enviornment for their child. It is very light on the history of Montessori and doen't have a ton of actual preschool type activities, it deals more with how to set up a Montessori friendly home enviornment. As a former Montessori preschool teacher, we often had parents who didn't know how to incorporate Montessori methods at home, this is a great book for that. It explains the importance of setting up a child friendly home and how to support your child in their efforts to be self sufficient. If you are considering putting your child into a montessori program either now or in the future, this is a wonderful book to start with in order to set up your household to support their more formal Montessori education, or if you just want tips on how to set up a child centered home"
4,"Nice introduction, Montessori-light","This is a very nice introduction to Montessori philosophy if you are totally new to the concept. Like any DK book it has beautiful photographs and it's the most visually attractive Montessori book I've seen, hence the 4 stars. However I personally found it pretty light and didn't have nearly enough info or activities as I was looking for. It's a useful read, but I would check it out from the library. I personally recommend ""Help Your Preschooler Build a Better Brain,"" and ""Teach Me To Do It Myself"" if you want a lot of good ideas for doing Montessori at home."
5,Great reference,"Fantastic reference for parents interested in the Montessori Method.Great photos and examples for quick reference.Modern and broken down points from Maria Montessori's ""The Absorbent Mind"" and other references."
1,Wasn't what I thought it was,"Didnt teach you how to raise your child Montessori it just glanced at Montessori topics ... Not very helpful Felt like I was reading a magazine. I was expecting tips and pointers and technique, most of the book was common sense"
5,Compulsory reading for all parents,This is one of the most useful books on child-rearing I have ever read. In many ways it is typical of DK - wonderful pictures and concise and relevant content. This makes it accessible to people unfamiliar with the Montessori approach. People more familiar with Montessori philosophy will recognise the authenticity of Tim Seldin's guidelines for parents. This book is an ideal gift for new parents and should be read by anyone who comes into contact with young children.
3,Light and basic,"I have plenty of parenting books, so I was disappointed to find that this book is pretty basic. There's a lot of padding in photos and introductory text, this book could be half the size. I don't know much about montessori, but I don't need another ""fundamentals of parenting"" book.This would be a good book if youa) have a short attention span or little interest in readingb) have no or very few other parenting booksI suggest getting it from the library instead. There's not enough information here to make it useful as a reference book."
5,Great information!,This is a wonderful parenting book that is very easy to read. It is a perfect gift for parents of young children. I highly recommend it to families interested in the Montessori philosophy but it is a great resource for anyone to use.
5,Review from the Publisher,"The usual and ""accepted"" explanation of the Protestant Reformation, says the author, makes sense only if the reader is ignorant of the Catholic Church and its history. This is a much-needed ""true view showing how Christendom suffered ""shipwreck"" in the Protestant Revolt against Christ and His Catholic Church. He traces the struggle, blow by blow, from the Advent of the Disaster, to the opening of the ""floodgates"" with Luther in 1517, through the ""English Accident"" and Calvin. He then shows the spiritual, military, political and financial struggles of this conflict among the French, English, Scottish, Dutch and German, describing how by 1648 the battle to keep Christendom united and in the Catholic Faith had failed of exhaustion, ending in a divided Europe, with the Protestant rebellion settling down to permanent possession of certain previously Catholic areas of Europe. No educated person can ignore this presentation of the facts of history. This is history as it happened!"
5,Great Book....very insightful,"Belloc, an English historian, is known for his views on Western civilization. Catholicism has played a HUGE part in forming culture and morals in the West. No one can argue that. However, many will shy away from the ideas presented in this particular work because it presents an uncomfortable theory: with the disruption and shattering of Christian unity came a disruption and shattering of Western civilization. This disruption did not occur at one time. Rather, it happened with each of the major heresies - each one attacking one facet of Christian - and therefore Western - civilization.I think this book is a great counter to the historical revisionism occurring in our age."
4,A different look at the Reformation,"I'll admit that I don't agree with some of his opinions. However, if you have some sense of history, this book offers some very compelling views on how people and events tied together to produce a significant event in Western culture. Other books can give you more on fine details; this book will give you a broad overview to keep in mind as you study the Reformation."
5,Makes you think!,"Joseph Heloise Pierre René Belloc (July 27, 1870 - July 16, 1953) was one of the most prolific writers in England during the early twentieth century. This is a credible rendering of his views on religion and politics.A worthy read."
3,It's written for bipolar dummies.,"I bought this book hoping to educate my father about my illness. The first third of the book was informative (not so much to me, since I've been bipolar since I was 15 and know all the information), but I thought it might inform my father.By the second third of the book, I realized that the book was written for bipolar people who have recently been diagnosed as bipolar. The book explains how to choose a psychiatrist, what to ask him/her, etc. At that point, it became rather useless to me, and my father.This book is intended to help people who are bipolar, but who know little to nothing about their illness. In that regard, it's a good book. It just wasn't helpful to me."
2,definitely not a great one--more for family members,"While this book does explain some about the differences in bipolar disorders and what they feel like, I feel this book was more made for family members to explain to them how WE feel with the disorder. It never really tells us how to cope or if its okay to feel certain things and why we feel them. It explains alot of the medications and how they help, but I feel it could have been a better book."
4,Very informative.,"If you are just diagnosed, this is a very informative book to educate you on your illness. Also for family and friends. A good first book."
2,Too Distant,"I have read many bipolar books and I found others more helpful. The Dummies book doesn't speak to me personally, although it has lots of facts. I didn't get the sense that I would like to go to this doctor. I mean, that is my response, anyway.Also, I know that it is petty, but I don't like the title. I don't like to think of myself as a dummy, and it made me uncomfortable to carry around a book that says ""bipolar disorder for dummies"" in public. Maybe if it were about doing my taxes I would feel different, but I'm a bit sensitive on this point."
4,Usefull for clinical use purposes,"Who is expecting a book with very usefull trends to everyday practice will find this book great. As will patients, families and caregivers that are looking for correct and reliable information about Bipolar Disease. It is not, however - as honestly his title shows - a book conceived to cover with expertise all the aspects - or most of them - of the theme. I found it very interesting and usefull in my everyday practice with patients and their families and caregivers, with many valuable suggestions and tools to an educationnal approach, for instance."
5,Very Helpful,"I got this book on Kindle for myself, now I'm ordering it in print to give to my parents. Good overview of basic information."
2,Skip it,"I would recommend ""The Bipolar Disorder Survival Guide"" over this book. I did not feel like it was professionally written. I questioned the quality and accuracy of the information. There is a better book out there for your money."
3,"Quick, easy, mildly entertaining read","Strange Fits of Passion is my second Anita Shreve read. I bought it simply because she wrote it and then realized it was about an abusive husband and a battered wife that flees with his child....After I realized that I was not too thrilled... I'm not too keen on that sort of plot.... I have to admit though it was much better than I expected - simply because of her descriptions. Shreve is a talented descriptive writer and her prose draws you in. Each chapter of the book is an interview of sorts of the characters in the story which is performed by a reporter that covered the story after it took place. This format kept me interested and the reader gets to see the story in the light of each character's opinion. I did enjoy this book, but it was one of those that after you finished reading it you are like....o.k. it's over lets start reading something else - I enjoy things that make me think a little more or at least wish it wasn't over..."
4,Strange Fits of Passion,"I was totally captivated by this book. I thought about it at night after I put it down, and I thought about it again in the morning. I have read other books by Anita Shreve, and they were excellent as well. But this story makes you want to scream at Mary. You see her mistakes, you see her helplessness, and you can't do anything. It brought to mind Black and Blue by Anna Quindlan. The same idea of wife beating, and not understanding how it gets this bad. I didn't want this story to end. I will certainly read all other books by Anita Shreve."
5,Page Turner,"This novel was incredible. It was my second Anita Shreve novel, ""Pilot's Wife"" being the first. Although I was deeply disappointed in the ""Pilot's Wife"" and hesitant to buy this novel in light of my previous disappointment, I am glad that I took the risk. The book is very well written and I thoroughly enjoyed the writing technique style which was very unique and captivating. This book deals with the very important issue of domestic abuse and what progress has occurred in the law and societies view of domestic violence within the past 20 years. Definately worth the read."
4,Anita did it again - Great Story!!!,"I have to rate this one up there with Weight of Water. You can truly relate to this main character and even though she may not have done things the right way, you could fully understand how she was thinking. She was not evil, she was kind, and just wanted to protect herself and her child. Anita's dialogue allowed you to get to know the people of the community, and before they started giving their opinions you knew what they would say. People are so predictable. It showed the fallacies of our legal system, sometimes they depend on hear say from people that have a hidden agenda, or just didn't take the time to see clearly what was going on. This was one of those can't wait to get off work to start reading books."
4,Excellent Read,"Anita Shreve does it again. There is not one book of hers that I dont like - her writing style is riveting. This book is about a woman who is trapped in an abusive marriage (in a time when there was not much awareness in regards to spousal abuse). It is written from when the heroine is charmed by her husband, falls in love - and eventually becomes the victim of abuse. She makes the decision to finally leave her husband, and she packs her child up and drives to an unknown town to hide. Events unravel from there - and the story is told through different people's perspectives."
3,"Almost, But Not Quite...","This book has a great story, characters and a wonderful sense of place. Anita Shreve has an amazing ability to make the small Maine seacoast town of this book so real, the reader is there. Loved this book and would rate it 5 stars up until the end. I just could not believe in the last 30 or so pages and really wished for a different ending."
5,Strange fits- couldn't put it down.,I read this book in twelve hours sick with the flu. I could not put it down.
4,"Good, but not her best","I liked this book by Anita Shreve, but it is not her best novel. I read it very quickly, and I think it falls in the middle of her novels in terms of writing."
5,excellent,What can I say another truly great spellbinding novel.Hard to put down.wON'T REGRET READING THIS ONE.kEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.
2,FIX THE GRIP THAT HOLDS THE SHOWER HEAD,"The grip for the shower head is not firm and will not hold the stream in place. I have been hit by the shower head and/or the shower head will hit the tub. This is a waste because the shower head and the charcoal filter are good products. Consumers do not need extras, just fix the grip."
1,Does not work in DVD players,It will only play in my computer. I am unhappy when my daughter wanted to see this movie and we were unable to do so.
4,Good CD!,"Dirty Looks fan from the beginning and bought this CD to round out my collection. I went from ""Chewing On The Bit"" (which I loved) to ""Slave To The Machine"" (which is my least favorite of all Dirty Looks music) and somehow missed this album when it came out. Good overall stuff from start to finish. For me the stand out tracks are ""Something In You"" and ""Half As Much"". After hearing this album I understand how the band transitioned from the previous album to the follow up. ""I Want More"" is from their album of the same name which has been re-released on FNA Records. Great song but it seems out of place on this album. Only 8 songs makes this a quick listen at less than 30 minutes which is very short for an album from 1996. A TRUE Dirty Looks fan won't be disappointed with this one but for this price you better REALLY, REALLY want it to spend the $$$$$."
4,Fell between the cracks,I am always disappointed when I think I own everything by a certain artist and then I come across something like RIP IT OUT. I missed this one somehow and now it is hard to find and expensive. It is still worth the money though.
5,Wonderful Lights,We bought these for our garages and back of the house. they look great! they look like expensive lights. the glass is beautiful when the light is on.
5,Awesome Hard Techno!!!,"Ok, there are several tracks on here which you can find on 'The World Of Gabber' which are infact longer, many tracks on here are not thier full length. Still.. if you manage to cough up money for this collection, i would!! This is the best 4 disc collection i have found & i felt i got my money's worth on this!! However i hate it when they say its the 'Ultimate' collection.. cuz they did leave alot out. Some of the tracks on here arent even worth it. And they still had room for more stuff or to make the tracks longer. Either way this is a good cd to buy! Also if you like ""The Nightmare"" on this cd make sure you get 'Techno Trax Vol 7' for the full version!!"
3,This is a cd that will please,"This is another S.H. cd for me to add to the collection. It is,however more than just another cd. It is a cut above the average.For this cd Scott uses the great Dave McKenna to play the piano support. Dave goes a good job with this area. Also the other sidemen used were A ok. Scott provided his usual solid performance.The song selection for this cd was a good one. Most of the songs used were my favorites.If you like Scott and his sound, this cd is a must for you.Recommendation: But this cd and enjoy!"
3,WRONG COLOR & Way to Much SHIPPING Charge,"I paid $12.99 for a StreetGlow ANLEDSLOR, Which was Marked ORANGE but was Miss Marked by Street Glow. It was GREEN for a 60K Show Car. Well, a $12.99 item with a $14.99 Shipping. VHR's Ship for $2.98 which is the same size or Bigger the the Light. Or a USPS Box for $5.00 would do just fine. They are raising there Shipping Cost to make a Bigger Profit on said item. Kind of WRONG, when Shipping cost more than the Item. Or a VHR from them Ship's for $2.98... BAD BUSINESS. Not AMAZONS Fault. It's The Seller which Amazon has Taken on Consignmant or asome Shit... Makes AMAZON L@@K bad though.. Ron"
1,Sounds Like They Ran Out Of Air!,"I love Air Supply, I have their greatest Hits CD and I love it and think the songs on that CD are great so that is why I bought their Christmas CD and sorry but I have to agree with the reviewer from Canada that this CD is boring! I love Christmas music but this CD just dosen't appeal to me at all and I find it to be a major snorefest!"
4,surprisingly big high rating,even though russell& graham were much better in sweet dreams or cant let go usually dont buy live or christmas boring stuff but here we have love is all
3,Air Supply Christmas CD,"There are not enough Christmas songs on this CD and the ones that are on it are kind of depressing, with a couple of exceptions."
1,have not find any idea behind the film,"I don't know what the director ment when he filmed it,I could not find any meaning...looks like a bad movie to me, or may be it's a parody on a bad movie?"
5,Very funny movie [5],This is a very funny movie. The characters are very rich. The actors and actresses does a great job. This is one fascinating movie appropriate for all ages. The interaction between all the characters are fantastic and very interesting. I highly recommended it.
3,NOT AVAILABLE IN DVD U.S. COMPATIBLE!!!!!! THIS IS T H E PROBLEM!!!!!!,MOST GREAT FOREIGN FILMS ON DVD ARE N O T U.S. COMPATIBLE - SO I HAD TO GET A S***TY QUALITY VHS TAPE TO SEE THIS GEM FROM SPAIN . . .
4,Almodovar: RED,"A bitter sweet Almodovar surrounded by his favorites actors.An interesting chemistry and coherence for this tormented story, told with a smile on the lips. This is Madrid. This is 'la movida'.This is sexy, and also maybe a little gross! And the omnipresent red color reminds Spain and the rest of the world that freedom had a price.Not my favorite Almodovar, but a good, unpredictable movie."
4,Very Disney,"An entertaining if somewhat longish movie, but 99% fact free. Seems 1861 Virginia looks an awful lot like 1960 something California. One wonders what was lacking in the actual exploits of Mosby and his 43rd Virginia that lead the writers to fabricate most all of the story except the mid-night abduction of the general from his headquarters in Fairfax.A fun movie, just don't expect to learn much historical from it. Oh, almost forgot the accents. Will Hollywood never learn all Southerners do not speak with the same accent, the characters are mostly Virginians, not Georgians. By the way, it's pronounced RappaHANic(rhymes with panic or manic) not Rappahonic. Good grief."
5,Superb debut novel!,"This was Mr. Forsyth's debut novel, and it couldn't have made a better impression so much as on the readers as on the critics. There was not one boring instant whatsoever and the suspense hung on throughout all of it's almost 500 pages. Now, to keep suspense going at such a length is already a major achievement. To do so right on his very first novel, is an even greater achievement. Mr. Forsyth showed himself as being a player who played his game really well, leaving the last hundred pages of his novel packed tight with tension, and the very last chapter with a slam-bang finale. Bravo!"
4,"A plain, realistic, brutal portrayal of a cold assasin","The Jackal (chacal), an efficient, inovative, clever, cunning, cold-blooded, ruthless, non-existant assasin. The portrayal of an assasin sent to kill Charles De Gaulle. May sound like an over-the-top storyline but this is anything but that, this is an absolute classic novel (reflected in the movie version). At the end of this novel you wonder how much of this story is actually fiction. Forsyth writes in a matter-of-fact style much like a reporting style, which won't let you get into the Jackal's mind and thought. A definite must-read, I love it!!!"
5,I would rank it as one of the best books I ever read.,"I found it to be the most challenging and thrilling book I ever read. It was a book I found very difficult to put down.The intrigue was magnificently played out.I have also seen the movie,on at least three ocassions, and have found it to be equally as thrilling."
4,A critic was comparing The Day of the Jackal with the DaVinci code book,"The reviewer trashed the DaVinci code book for its sloppy writing, but brought great praise--justly deserved--for The Day of the Jackal. The reviewer said he reads it every two years or so because it is that riveting.It was a long time since I read it so I bought it and enjoyed it once more.It does get repetitive and boring at times the way detective work and good spy work gets repetitive and boring at times.There is a lot of fantasy in the story. Jackal's weapon could never be as accurate as that, period.But the only flaw I do fault in the novel is that the Jackal was focused on doing his mission AND escaping. He would have never been able to excape the net he was in. Never.But what a great read!"
3,The Day of the Jackal,"""The Day of the Jackal"" was somewhat disappointing to me.I was expecting an exciting thriller and what I got was aslow and technical read. If you're interested in the plotI suggest you try ""The Bourne Identity"" by Robert Ludluminstead. The Jackal is much more entertaining in the handsof Ludlum."
3,Children's Book,"I wanted a good copy of the book of the old film which I enjoyed so much. Unfortunately I didn't read the fine print on the ad. This is a shortened version (100 pages) of the complete book, sold elsewhere on Amazon. A good book, yes, but not the complete book I was hoping for."
5,A Brilliant Suspense Thriller!,"Forsyth's first remains his best, and although I've read everything else of his and he is probably my single favorite author, it seems unlikely that he'll ever surpass this effort. Perversely, I found myself rooting for the assassin, which is testament to Forsyth's brilliant portrayal of him. I found his equal treatment of both hunter and hunted to be compelling, and while the ending leaves the reader with some ambiguity, this only serves to make the story more plausible. It's been over 15 years since I first read this novel, and I've never seen it topped."
1,Against the Laws of the Universe,"I started The Day of the Jackal with high hopes, and I was just making my way through the first chapter, trying to sort out the characters, when I came across this information: On August 22, 1961, dusk had fallen at 8:10 pm, but on August 22, 1962, dusk fell at 8:35 pm. Those 25 minutes were to change the history of France."" Maybe some physicist or astronomer out there can correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that impossible? On the same day of the year, in the same location, wouldn't dusk fall within a few seconds of the time it fell the year previously? Since the failure of the assassination plot depended on this fact, and since I'm not normally interested in plots and chases and assassination attempts, I stopped reading the book."
4,The Day of the Jackel,"The Day of the Jackel is a fascinating look into the mind of an assassin. ""The Jackel"" kills not to fulfill a vendetta, but rather his bank account (in Switzerland, where else?). The intense preparation - identity, location, weapon - are described so throughly by Mr. Forsyth . . . it makes one wonder how he got all this information. Perhaps a tall, blond, Englishman with a love for expensive suits, afternoon tea, and only the finest luggage? Anyway, this delve into French history is an excellent read. The pace is hindered by a slow, somewhat tedious beginning but the second half is very enjoyable."
5,The President Hunter,"What would be the most difficult thing in the world to hunt and kill? The Snow Leopard? A giant squid? Saddam Hussein? How about a President who has increased his security to the maximum? Yes. Here we meet the Jackal- a professional killer like no other. Paid to assinate the French Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle, he masquerades to hide his identity and he stalks his prey. We see every detail of his plan from plot to execution. But the hunter is equally the hunted. Does he succeed? C'mon now- I'm not going to spoil the climax! You'll have to read the book to find out! Forsyth writes about the subject with uncanny knowledge and intensity- a fiction that will keep you at the edge of your senses!"
4,Really good but not exceptional.,I really didn't like this book all that much. Not enough of of intrigue for me.
3,Oops,"Started Day of the Jackal and got to the part about the ""Mistake"" of timing. The claim that a calendar from the previous year would affect sundown by 25 minutesleft me wondering, if, perhaps, Paris had moved south, or would it be north.It will be a struggle to finish the book after such a major OOpps."
2,Very disappointing,I bought this book based on the reviews of others on this board. I was very disappointed. The book was well written but I just did not think that it moved fast enough. It took me months to finish this book. After reading the reviews I was probably expecting too much.
5,Best spionage thriller,This outstanding book grabs your attention every word you read. Forsyth style is very remarkable in this book as he describes the scenaries where the thrill is carried out.
5,Gail Brewer-Giorgio IS Elvis Presley,"This book is amazing for one key reason...The author IS Elvis!Think about it... How else is he going to write an autobiography unless he disguises it as a novel about a singer who fakes his own death?Then, when it's written and published, it doesn't sell well because it's called ""Orion"" not ""My Autobiography By Elvis Presley"".This book ""Is Elvis Alive"" was written solely for the purpose of pointing Elvis fans in the direction of his Autobiography, something they'd have otherwise missed.If you were a real fan of Elvis, you'd have known that. Just ask Andy kaufman."
4,One of the best on the subject.,"This book is fantastic. You won't be able to put it down. This book is what got me started on the investigation and what I have learned since then would astound you. If you don't buy another book this year..., Buy this one. Gail also has two other books out on this subject and they get better each time she writes one. The second is 'The Elvis Files' and the latest is 'The Elvis Cover-Up"". I highly recommend 'The Elvis Cover-Up'. It is definately the best."
4,"Terrific Movie Score, Great Theme CD","Awhile back, I began to recognize that, quite often, I would find myself more taken with a movie's music score than with the movie itself. ""Grand Canyon"" was a decent movie...but the music score was absolutely mesmerizing. In my opinion, the score elevates the movie's message far above what was otherwise a fairly pedestrian script. Scores should enhance movies...to say that this score succeeds in this task is an understatement."
2,Nothing Great,"I found these booster pads to be fairly absorbent. They seemed to do a good job helping prevent leaks at night. The thing I hated about this product is, in the morning when I removed the product, it was falling apart. usually leaving a layer of absorbency material on my skin. I would not recommend for overnight use, but they seem OK for daytime, when they are changed more often."
1,"Says 25', shipped 6'","Like the other reviewer, the description says 25' but what you get is 6'. Very disappointing. Technical details clearly say 25'. How can they blatantly lie?"
1,Mislabeled,Ordered 25 foot cables and I got the 6 foot version. Helps if you don't misrepresent the product since I read all of your descriptions.
4,Fun writing exercises!,I'm using this workbook in conjuction with the Rosetta Stone. It's a good reinforcement tool. I love all the writing exercises!
2,not comfortable,the patent leather upper cuts into my foot. I haven't been able to wear them for more than 30 minutes because it is so uncomfortable.
5,I'll never be the same,"Oh man of god you are truly a blessing and have been a blessing in my life even though we may never meet in person your messages come straight from the throne room of heaven seemingly just for me! I love your message you preached a RHEMA in Dallas a few years back entitled ""Cover Your Eyes"" You are blessed with the gift of preaching and singing may god give you strength in the battles i know that try to consume you."
1,Was it watered down?,"I can compliment the seller on the expeditious manner in which I received the product. However, after my girlfriend starting wearing the perfume, she noticed that it didn't have the same scent or last not anywhere longer did that of previous perfumes. This was my first time ordering such a product on-line, and I have to question the authenticiy of the product, or whether it was just watered down. At any rate, I had to go out and buy a newer brand at a local store."
4,FLOWERS AND FRUITS ENHANCE THIS FRAGRANCE,"This is one of the early women's fragrances launched by Boucheron. It is more dramatic than Initial, highlighted by a floral Oriental tone.Jaipur or ""jewel"" was inspired by a trip made by the company's current president's grandfather to Jaipur, a city whose reputation for precious stones was legendary. Thus, the fragrance was introduced in a jewel flacon. The original bottles are, of course, highly prized by collectors today.Long recognized as makers of elegrant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched."
4,All in all a good modem.,"No install problems, great transfer speed, and takes up very little room on my desk. If you are looking to upgrade to a new modem in the near future you should check out the Viking USB External Modem, as it is definitely worth a look. I particuliarly like this product due to it's ease of installation ( great for the ""oh I don't know how to install computer parts ) user and it's good speed. I don't know if i would recommend this to the laptop user due to the odd shape, but otherwise this is a great product!"
4,Chock full of metal,"I really enjoyed this album. Medusa Oblongada employ some of my favorite subgenres in interesting ways. My Green shows a jazzy prog-thrash style with a tinge of industrial. Soak continues in this vein adding a bit of a doomy feel. Bitter opens up with an introspective 'clean' guitar intro before delving straight into a sludgey doomfest. The rest of the album continues down that path and does a pretty good job along the way. The vocals often remind me of Eric Forrest's work with Voivod. The musicianship is top notch. The production could have been better, but it's by no means a deal-breaker. I recommend this album to any and all metal fans."
2,Want plain vanilla?,"If you do want plain vanilla then ""Tangled"" is your treat. Get beyond the great cover photo and the sizzle stops quickly. I'm not sure at what point the creativity died, but it was somewhere between ""Fur"" and this record. I love Jane, really I do, but this has none of the energy, uniqueness, or vibrant perky (yes, I said it) strength of her other efforts. Except for ""99 Ways"" the most disheartening aspect is that she takes no chances, and it all plays out rather dull as in let's think of a song title and build safe music around it. ""End of the Day"" and ""Paperheart"" are decent tracks but stand out sort of like being the world's tallest midget. If you want unabashed fun, energy, and a sense of her true personality get ""Fur"" or her self title debut. Out."
5,A great addition to any collection of plays or humor.,"I teach playwriting, and whenever one of my students undertakes a solo piece, I recommend RED DIAPER BABY for study. It is one of the two or three best-written solo shows I've ever had the pleasure of seeing (and I've seen dozens) -- a beautifully-judged balance of characterization, novelistic detail, social and political satire, and raunchiness. The other pieces in this collection are damn good, too. This is work to enjoy and from which to learn."
1,Not Plug and Play,"None of the disks that were sent with the modem had the file(s) that was needed. Tech support said they would send me the file that I needed overnight, or that I could go to the website and download it myself. Needless to say, I went to the website and downloaded the necessary files, and sure enough one file was missing from the disks sent."
1,Viking Needs to Get It Right (Side Up),"The Viking card I received from Amazon had the labels reversed, top to bottom. This naturally led to inserting the card upside-down--an excellent way to cause expensive damage to a laptop. Such lax quality control on Viking's part does NOT lead to confidence in their products.(Amazon's Customer Service, on the other hand, was truly outstanding.)"
3,Viking PC Card Modem,"This item turned out to be something I could not use, so had to return it to the supplier. Nothing wrong with the product however."
2,Plodding!,The stories are OK but plod along at a slow rate. Little-to-no background effects and the music that is there is very cheesy. Simply doesn't set the mood.
3,Hokey but fun,"This Halloween CD is ultimately a collection of folk talkes and urban legends, set to kinda-appropriate-but-kinda-cheesy music. The production values aren't bad. Man, Poe's THE RAVEN goes on forever!"
3,"I liked the red in the film, good use of title","Ah to red. The critics liked it but not me, lots of other things to enjoy."
3,.,"A thoughtful movie which has its moments, but I found myself a bit bored at points. This is not due to a bias againt foreign films or slow pacing, as I like foreign films *and* slow pacing, but rather an inability to empathize with the characters or engage myself with what was happening to them. Not bad, but not great either."
5,Simple & Sweet,"This is a nice book that talks about a parent love for child. It says for example it is heavier than 9 hippos. It goes from 1 to 10. The illustrations look like they are torn pieces of paper. The illustrations are fine; they are unique and good to expose your child to various forms of art. The book is in English or Spanish so is an excellent starting point. The sturdy board book makes it sure to last for many, many readings."
3,Average compared to other trip/journey books I've read,An interesting trip to make but the book isn't very good as a guide nor is it a very good story told type book. It's just really average.
1,Ernie Holmes,"I couldn't agree more that Barney Kessel is one of our greatest jazz guitarists in America. I find fault, however in the engineering of the record. I do not know if it was on the original recording, but this was driven too hard causing clipping distortion that is horrible to listen to.I have noticed this same condition on other recordings by Barney. What a shame."
2,"Single bulb, not a pair","Since headlight bulbs are usually sold in pairs, the seller should have mentioned the item is for one single bulb. My original order was over $25 with other items, so I got free shipping. Now I am going to have to pay for shipping, which costs almost as much as the bulbs just to get the matching pair.On a side note, I do realize the picture only shows one bulb, but I've learned that the picture is not always what you are getting."
4,Christmas Revisited,"First, this is not a movie, it is an hour long 1950's TV production that stars Thomas Mitchel in the role of the Jolly old Elf. I found this version to be quite enjoyable, not as good as the Edmond Gwenn version, no one plays Santa like Gwenn, but this was a neat little trip back in time when TV put on their own abbreviated version of classic movies. Lux Radio Theater in the days of radio put on their radio audio version of classic movies and in the '50's when TV came along Lux continued in the new medium with hour long versions made for TV of movies. This is vintage '50's TV at it's most fun, and is a real blast from the past. Quite nice and well worth a look as an alternative to the movie that you've seen 100 times."
2,A little lame,"Because this was condensed for tv, it feels like there are large gaps in the story and that you are rushed through to the end. Sit back and enjoy one of the full-length movies which develop the plot and the characters and let you savor the ""miracle"" more fully."
4,Superior in most ways than the original,"Believe it or not, this TV production from 1955 eclipses the original feature film from 1947 in nearly every way, despite its cheap packaging and slightly subpar AV quality. It is better-acted with a tighter script, and even the courtroom sequence (which I think is the strongest element of the original) holds its own. Just don't confuse it with the original if that's what you're looking for."
1,O man. This is terrible.,This movie is absolutely terrible. I dont know why they would even follow up and try to remake the original classic. I would give this movie no stars at all.But they wont let u do that. It felt like the whole movie was being rushed. It seemed like they were trying to hurry through there lines as fast as they could. This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Its not worth your 50 cents. Enough said!
1,You've GOT to be kidding,"You'll probably find this book hilariously funny until it strikes you that you paid ... for it. I'm pretty sure these guys know what they're talking about, but when it comes to talking about it they seem to have a problem. The text is choppy. The sample code is so disjointed that it's almost impossible to follow. In chapter 2, for instance, we run into something called the Contact Manager. This example uses a form with several menu items and buttons. Instead of descriptive names that'll let you understand what's going on without bringing up the program the buttons have names like ""button1,"" ""button2,"" etc. Names of the menu items are ""menuItem2,"" ""menuItem3,"" etc. Trying to learn something from this book while you're away from your computer is an exercise in futility. Save your ... and take your wife out to dinner with it."
4,excellent voyage,"Very enjoyable film, great intro, the black and white turning to color, etc., not unsimilar to -- but done better than -- the Titanic sequence, from wreck to sailing liner. Some priceless scenes: the musical glasses in the kitchen, the warring arias in the engine room. Similar to another great, Powell/Pressburger's dazzling Black Narcissus, in that: each is a largely unknown gem, each has dazzling colors, and each done entirely in studio."
4,"not the greatest one, but great as everyone else","ok, i can admit that fellini makes great cinema using visual means but, can you say it`s not deep enough? every film by him (at least after la dolce vita) comes with a lot of content and social satire. Taking some examples: la dolce vita critizies italian high classes, ginger e fred does the same with tv people and fake lifes, satyricon attacks directly our society. e la nave va goes against opera singers and their world, but it doesnt end there. opera singers are like movie stars of the WWI. everything its fake, everything is a scenery, the ship is an opera show. and is as cold and superficial as the opera world (and cinema world, of course). Fellini is a genius. I think we can all forgive him for filming amarcord and watch every other movie again. Even Roma, a kind of exercise for amarcord, has its greatness. just dont go on saying that fellini is not deep enough. please"
4,"Someone help me, please!!","I know that as a child I saw this movie in the late 70's/early 80's, however, there is no listing whatsoever on IMDB at all. It's like it never existed. Please tell me I am not the only one who remembers this being made into a movie! And if so, who the young stars were that played Lynn, Judith, and Mouse. Thanks!"
1,Dont waste your money,"if you are a SPACE 1999 , you will be extremely dissapointed with this figure...is simply cheap, doesnt look like Alan Carter & breaks easily. I tried very carefully to get the figure out of the box and one of the arms was broken .I thought that it was repairable , but no it was broken beyond repair. Save your money and buy one of the really expensive ""EAGLE"" Spaceships and you wont regret it (at least in the long run) but these figures are a waste of money."
5,It is not an easy reading,Take your time. Dont read it in one day. It migth take you a entire live. Belive in it. Its true. And if you want results work hard. Dont spect to astral travel if you smoke 20 cigarettes a day. See you
5,All you need to know!,"This book explains in detail how to practice metaphisics, astral projections, spiritual contact, etc.I have tried some of them with great results.Great book."
4,I liked it!,"The only thing that wasn't top notch was the acting, but everything else was great. This movie gave good insight of young Tiger Woods life story. It shows us his life as a child, teens, and young adult. It shows us that Tiger was always been discriminated all his life. He had to fight so hard just to get to what he wanted to do with his life. It also shows us that he is shown as a Black Man by the media, but he himself has always says he is not just Black but Asian as well. I liked it."
2,Not quite that bad,"I'm writing this review to let the world know that this movie isn't quite as bad as the other reviewers have said. It is definately hokey. With the exception of Keith David playing Earl Woods, the movie is pretty badly acted. It has a very made-for-tv movie quality, which isn't surprising since it was made for Showtime.It does provide a pretty basic insight into Tiger's life up until the '97 masters. Its an easy and light movie to watch.Please note, I didn't shell out any money for this tape - it was just shown on Showtime. I think I wouldn't pay more than $5.00 for this movie."
4,"a good ram, increases ur comps strength to some extent","i have a 64mb ram, and i got this1, so i had 128mb ramand it did imporve my comps performance.overall it is a good addonshould get it"
3,Received as promised,"I bought this book for my wife. While she's no dummy, she is, however, starting out canning on her own and has plenty of literature to access, I know that the XXX for Dummys book line has a good reputation and the price was way below right, probably about half or so retail, so it was worth the wait to get it."
4,nice book,"as always the 'for dummies' series is always full of interesting, educational information without being boring. alot of the info in the book can be found on the fda websites for free download, but it's got some good solid info and makes a nice gift for the novice canner."
2,unsatisfactory,"I give this book a ""U"" for unsatisfactory. It has NO informationon canning meat, poultry or fish !!! It recommends another book- apparently the author thinks it's way too hard and scary to canmeat. It isn't - buy another book with more practical informationin it."
4,Review,"Book arrived within stated shipping period. Slight damage to the cover, but since it is used, this was expected. Still in good condition."
5,"Makes Canning and Preserving a breeze! Tasty recipes, too!","I've read this cookbook cover to cover, sampled some recipes, and I'm impressed! Karen Ward took all the guess work and concerns I had out of both canning and preserving. The balance of taste in her recipes is extraordinary. Her Pear Chutney's the best I've ever had (and I've had plenty). My husband adores her bread and Butter Pickles! A great cookbook to have on hand to make holiday food gifts, too."
3,Very few canning recipes,"Good overview for a beginner, but I wanted more canning recipes. You'll need to go to another book to get that. This one just had a few jelly, salsa, pickle and a few directions on canning specific fruits and vegetables with very little on food dehydration. If you decide to get this, you'll need another book down the road if you decide to can or preserve anything else."
5,Better Than The First Two,Short and sweet.This is the last movie kidswb dubbed 6 years ago.Its a whole lot better than the first movie and the movie 2000.But the werent bad i liked those two too.Huh theres alot of action sences in this see it if you havent yet most people were already detailed so thats why i dont want to say much.
2,Disapointed,I usually love anime (especially pokemon) but that movie was... just sad and I don't mean it was a particullarly sad plot but it was a sad atempt at a movie. I thought that the story exemplified childish ignorance and selfishness in the little girl. I also didn't like that girl didn't care if she had her real parents or not that she would just take Ash's mom and Entie(or however you spell it) as replacements. The fact that Entie was meerly a figment of her imgination was disapointing aslo. The 'Unknowns' I thought were the reasonless part that brought the whole story togather. But as anoying as it was it was slitly entertaining.
3,Sort of boring.....,"The first two movies were okay, but this one was the boringest movie of all..........I wish they would released a subbed version of Pokemon on VHS and DVD."
1,It could have been better!,"This 3rd Pokémon movie, that looks like 'Alice In Wonderland' in the Pokémon world, was a big dissapointment for me, the story is thin and confusing, the movie is overloaded with effects, the soundtrack is boring, but it was good to see Ash's mum in a bigger role, and watch all the new Pokémon's like Pichu, Houndour, Cyndaquil and Totodile."
3,No Cover,"BUYER BEWARE! I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND GOT THE REAL DVD, BUT!!! THERE WAS NO COVER. NOW, I KNOW I BOUGHT IT USED! BUT IF THE SELLER WRITES ""USED-LIKE NEW"" AND DOESNT STATE THAT THERE ISNT A COVER, WHOS IN THE WRONG?"
1,please Not Again!!,"THE THIRD MOVIE WAS THE WORST MOVIE OF THE THREE.IT WAS ABOUT A GIRL WHO LOSES HER FATHER IN THE UNKNOWN AND SOLVES A PUZZLE IN WHICH A DOG-LIKE POKEMON GRANTS HER EVERY WISH.SHE STEALS ASH'S MOM AND THEY TRY AND GET HER BACK.THE ENTIRE MOVIE IS BASICALY A FANTASY WORLD WITH BORING BATTLE SEQUENCES.I WOULD GIVE IT 1 STAR.EVERYONE WHO THINKS THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST THING SINCE SLICED BREAD,GET A HINT.HELLLLLOOOOO!!!THIS IS NOT THE GREATEST ANIME,IN FACT IT IS THE WORST ANIME.THERE ARE ANIME SHOWS I RECCOMEND TO YOU LIKE COWBOY BEBOP AND YU YU HAKUSHO WHICH PREMIER EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT AT 11 ON CARTOON NETWORK.RATHER THEN WACHING SHOWS LIKE BLUE SEED AND GUNDUM WING YOU ARE SITTING THERE WATCHING THIS..."
5,WAY BETTER THAN DIGIMON MOVIE!,"Okay i suffered a lot with the first Pokemon film, but then, in the second film, i found it enjoyable, but this, this one it's truly very enjoyable,very mature story, great animation, quite very good music, but as many people say here the short stinks!, this film it's way funnier and way better than that digigarbage ot that Monster Rancher, but this is the kind of film that i will go to see to the cheap cinema or to the mall cinema, also let me tell you that the god of animation, Hayao Miyazaki, co directed and co writed the film, believe it or not, it's just that they didn't give him, credit, well, this along with Spy Kids it's one of the best children's films of the year."
5,The BEST movie they made,I saw the movie when it came and when I saw the info on it I thought that this had had to have been the best movie they had made and it was. If you have kids that are Pokemon fans I think you should take them to see this movie. It starts with Pikachu and Pichu. Pichu are brothers who meet Pikachu and Pikachu gets in trouble with this Pokemon that I dont know who it was. Then they get onto the movie and that was so cool to show all those new Pokemon that are not in the show. They really showed what this Pokemon are really like when they are in the wild. A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR KIDS ALL AGES!!!
5,To know the Unown...,"This movie is the best Pokemon movie, after the first that is. I love both the soundtrack and the movie itself. I've watched it plenty of times, and still can't get enough of it!Ash and friends arrive at what is supposed to be the most beautiful town anywhere, but are dissapointed to see a huge crystalized formation taking over a large mansion and moving towards the rest of the town. Ash must save a young girl who's unleashed the power of the Pokemon Unown. he must also find his way to where his mom has been taken inside the mansion. He battles a legendary Pokemon named Entei and travels through odd dimensions that are the dreams and wishes of the young girl, made real by the Unwon before he can rescue his mom and save the town.I reccomend this movie to anyone, as it's a great family movie. I also think that the soundtrack should be purchased after seeing the movie so that you can hear the pop songs!"
4,"It's good, but not great","Pokemon 3 is about the Unknown who feel sorry for a little girl who lost her family and so she instead creates this fantasy world where the legendary pokemon Entei is her best friend. WHen she craves a mother she sends Entei out, ironically enough Entei captures Ash mother. Ash then must go in and stop Entei and save his mother.This movie unfortunatly suffered the same curse as the first with the story. Only instead of the story being a little to cutsey it's almost to dark. The little girl loses her family, then kidnaps someone elses parent. The action is good but unfortunatly the story is once again weak."
5,The best pokemon movie ever!!!!!,"The thing I hate most about these movies are the shorts! But the movies are the best part! I think pokemon 3 the movie is the best yet. The little Unown guys are just SO cute and all. As a matter of fact, this movie should get 50 stars, pokemon 2000, 40, and pokemon 1, 30. I know it's the best one so far. But who knows what pokemon 4 will be about...?"
5,Good,DVD plays well and arrived within the time frame. Good Pokemon movie and fits well in my collection. Case looks good.
4,Pokemon,My son asked for Pokemon 3 movie for Christmas. He has seen it at least 5 times since when he got his movie a week ago.
2,"Right size, poor fit","I was excited to get this comb, as I've been cutting my own hair for 3+ years now. The 1"" comb I currently have is a bit short, so I thought the 1.25"" would be a better length. I read the reviews of the wahl 1.25"" comb and didn't like how the comb had only 5 tongs (too much space=choppy cuts). Anyway, got this guy and put it on my wahl clippers (I'm in the process of upgrading to some nicer Andis or Osters). Two main problems. First, the comb slides side to side. Second, the comb tongs are thick at the base, so the cut is...let's just say inefficient. I'm now looking at buying the andis size F (1.25"") comb (check them out at the following linkAndis High Quality Plastic Universal Snap-On Large Pet Clipper Comb, Size F, 32mm).Mark 1:14-15 (NASB)Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,and saying, ""The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."""
4,Waring IC70 Brushed Stainless Steel Professional Ice Crusher 12-c.,"I liked the ice crusher, I just wish it crushed and not chopped the ice. I wanted an ice crusher, not chopper"
3,ICE CRUSHER,I LIKE MY ICE CRUSHER BUT THE ICE THAT YOU ARE READY TO CRUSH DOESN'T GO DOWN INTO THE BLADES RIGHT AWAY SOMETIMES IT JUST GOES ON TOP OF THE BLADES AND THEN IT DOESN'T CRUSH I HAVE TO STOP THE MACHINE AND TRY TO GET THE ICE OUT OR SHAKE IT TO GET THE ICE TO GO DOWN INTO THE BLADES
1,Ours failed at 13 months,"The product works, although if you feed it regular size ice cubes from a tray it tends to jam, we learned not to fill up the ice trays to the top.Our unit failed at 13 months, one of the blades started slipping and would get jammed with the ice. I tried to find replacement parts on the Internet, but could not find a source and I suspect that even if I was able to find the replacement blade assembly it would be cost prohibitive.Overall I could not recommend this product as I believe that one year's use for $80.00 is not worth it."
4,Good Stuff,"Works like a charm, now me and my baby can make enough cocktails to keep up with my boozehound friends."
4,2003 Civic LX Metra 70-1721 Harness,"Works with 2003 Civic LX coupe. The colors and the included color code reference for the metra harness matched up perfectly with my pioneer headunit wire colors. Good for if you want a clean install have own a soldering gun. Eliminates iffy ""loose"" crimp connections required with all those bulky splice connectors. This leaves the option to reinstall your factory deck with zero headache in the future if you sell your car or whatnot.One thing to note for civic owners, if you have keyless entry, installation of an aftermarket headunit will disable the button on your remote to lock the car. At least that's my experience. Unlocking the car will still work.I know Metra sells Y harnesses for other cars that have this issue, I didn't see an application for this car on their site. This is the only reason I gave 4 stars.If you have a ton of aftermarket alarm/security stuff, then I doubt that your keyless entry will be affected."
5,It's a bunch of wires. It works.,"I wanted to confirm that this works with the 2002 Honda Civic.The wires are thick and seem to be top quality. The clip fits smoothly with the aftermarket stereo I purchased.There were a few extra leads that I didn't need for my deck, so if you have a couple loose wires after the four speakers, the red, yellow and black wires are hooked up, don't worry. Double and triple check of course."
5,Consistent,Metra always makes the best harnesses. People come to me with their cut up factory wiring and i always use this to install a new factory radio in.
3,Works... but a bit lacking,"Cheaper cost than many of the others found on-line. But disappointed to get only the harness shown in a shipping bag. No connection information, or even a suggested website for information. I had to go look it up again and find it on my own. Also... the connection needed for the steering wheel controls is not present in this harness... which means that if you buy the SWC adapter, you will still need to cut into the vehicle harness to connect it. Would have been nice if they included it, as it's only one additional wire. :-("
5,Very Good,"This product makes changing your current deck quickly and easily. Using heat shrinks & a quick solder, it was ready to go and is still performing months after I purchased."
3,"Good connector, but needs modification if you want to use steering wheel controls","The connector/harness I received was fine, but I had to modify it to maintain steering wheel control. I had to remove one of the extra pins/wires and reinsert into pin 3 of the connector. This is pretty easy, and worked fine, but it would have been nice to have it work out of the box. I used this connector along with the Metra Axxess ASWC Universal Steering Wheel Control Interface and a Clarion CX501. I installed this in my 2002 Acura MDX. Radio works great and steering wheel control is flawless.An alternative to modifying the connector/harness is splicing into the steering wheel wire ahead before it goes into the Acura connector... but that defeats the purpose of having a harness. There may be other Metra harness that have steering wheel control for acura, but I didn't find them."
5,after market radio adapter harness,"I installed a Metra Turbokit on my cousin's 2005 Honda Accord, this harness allowed me to solder it to the new stereo and plug it into his Honda wiring harness. Great Product!!"
3,undecided,"Not a bad product. I would only buy this if you ever plan on installing your factory radio again. You still have to splice the wires to hook it up to the aftermarket radio (therefor it adds an extra 6-8"" of wires in your dash....bulky!). I would recommend cutting the factory wire harness and splicing the wires yourself to your new radio. And I highly recommend getting the ""Posi-Product Twist-Lock"" wire connectors directly from Crutchfield (they're cheaper/contain more then any other online place).I hope this info helps you guys."
3,Doesn't fit a 2000 Integra,I bought this Metra wiring harness (70-1721) that is advertised for 1998 & up Hondas and Acuras. Metra mislabeled the wiring harness because it doesn't fit a 2000 Integra. Read a couple websites and found the correct one to be Metra 70-1720. Hope this helps someone else trying to figure out the correct harness for their Integra. The 70-1720 harness fits perfectly as expected.
5,My new CD player works,Connection is as simple as matching the colors of the cables. The only function of my CD player that isn't quite working properly is the auto dimming feature when the headlights are turned on. I don't know if it is the fault of the harness being wired incorrectly or due to my car not being wired to support this.
5,Easy and in no time!,"Just as with every purchase on Amazon, I ordered the product and it showed up as promised within a few days. The harness was exactly what was required to install a new stereo in our car. Thanks for the quick service and reliability. Amazon always seems to come through for us!"
2,Kind of Lame,"Too simplistic, even for a complete novice--also, the illustrations are downright weird. There's a whole chapter where the artist has drawn normal faces except everybody has a circle for a nose. Probably there's a point there, but it escapes me. Also, I'd rather have straight instruction than somebody trying to be cute and funny and failing miserably. That said, there are a few good points to the book, but I wouldn't buy it new and pay full price."
2,"Starts off good, but then......","Well, I really wanted to learn how to draw well, so I picked this up. The first few chapters really help, but then it became was to hard for a beginning artist. Some of the stuff she wants you to draw is insane, and I just gave up on this book. If you want a good drawing book for beginners, don't look at this one."
3,Not For Beginners,"I used to draw/sketch up until I was in my teens and chose this book as a primer to help reignite my interest. Have to say, I was pretty disappointed in it. I was familiar with the concepts discussed but there was very little here for the beginning artist to help them explore their budding talent. This is aimed more at those who just want a quick reference on-hand. In that regard it's not bad, but not something I'll be using on a regular basis. A better alternative would be How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way, which explains the ideas presented here in much better detail."
3,mixed feelings...,"The ""Dummies"" series have always been a simple way to get a nice over view on a variety of subjects. This title however fell a little short for me. My expectations before the book arrived was that it would be a step by step, how-to-draw book for beginning artists. While it does contain information on a variety of drawing techniques and subjects, I was more than a little surprised at the amount of text. I was hoping and expecting a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 drawing to text ratio while it is almost the opposite. Reading about drawing is fine but showing a beginning artist with multiple steps is more what I had wanted and I didn't feel the book delivered either as a drawing book or a ""Dummies"" worthy offering."
4,Excellent book for beginners,"I don't buy books very often simply because I don't want clutter in the house. I have borrowed a lot of books related to drawing from the library, but the only one that I thought of buying is this one. It's simply written; the instructions are clear, and I love the encouragements the author uses to keep us going. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star is because I would have wanted some instructions on how to draw without a model. I want to be able to draw any animal in any position without looking at a picture or at the animal itself and there was no mention of that in the book. Otherwise, this book is a must-have for those learning how to draw."
4,a good book for starting out,this is a good book for starting to learn to draw. it has the basic thing you need to know. not very pretty just the facts.
5,A Good Book,This is a great book for those who want to learn how to draw. The lessons are fun. And It's great for those who need a refresher course as well.
4,Liked it but some things I wasn't fond of,"I like the book. it's got details and gives examples, however; I wasn't fond of the tiny print or the side captions and paragraphs. That's just my opinion though. For some people it's ok but for me I would have rather it all be together. Other than that this book is a good tool for people wanting to sharpen their art skills or people wanting to take up drawing"
5,Great Book!,Great book if you're thinking about making drawing a hobby. It gives you the skills and tools you need to get started.
3,not for an autistic teen,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing a copy that I received for free through the Vine program.Well I had hoped that this book would be useful for my 14-year old autistic daughter who loves to draw, but alas it is just not right for her. She has no patience for, and no interest in, the overwhelming sheer mass of information and details provided.On the other hand this may mean that this book is just right for you! if you want to read a lot about drawing."
1,condition was terrible.,The condition of the book was not even acceptable. The entire contents were water or coffee stained. I don't even like to touch it. I was extremely disappointed and shocked that something would be offered in this condition besides charging for it.
2,Not very useful.,"I have been working on teaching myself drawing for a while, working primarily through books and online demos. Of all the sources I used, I found this to be the least useful. I didn't feel this really helped me with useful techniques, nor did the examples given break down what they did enough to help me figure out -how- to draw them. ""Figure Drawing for Dummies"" is more useful, perhaps primarily because it had a tighter focus. This is not a book that goes far enough to be useful for the beginner."
5,good book to get you started,"I liked this book a lot, having NO experience drawing at all, other than the sketching out a few very rough and not very recognizable images of way I wanted things to look in my house when working with a contractor. I am not sure you can really learn drawing from a book (I think interaction and review by a teacher/mentor is needed) but the book really was helpful and sharpened up my drawing quite a bit in the few weeks I worked through it. It has a nice encouraging tone, and does try to lay out (and illustrate) basic principles (e.g. perspective, shading) with lots of tips and advice on technique along the way.It is a very good start I think for the novice and made me at least want to keep on learning - I may sign up for art classes at my local community college now that I feel (thanks to this book) that I have at least a very basic foundation on which to build."
3,"Too many words, not enough visuals","Perhaps this book would work for someone with a different learning style or who already has taken drawing classes. But as a complete novice, I found the book's text-heavy approach overwhelming and not helpful for my learning."
4,Pleased or not so Pleased!,"When I received the Dvd I never suspected anything wrong with it so I wrapped it up for a xmas present. I never had any problems with the company, so when I was told that it didn't play that it was a 2 instead of a 1 in the world logo on the back of the Dvd. I contacted the company and they gave me my money back I was so happy that we were able to come to a solution about my Dvd. I never detected that it was a 2 when I bought but I do look closer now so that doesn't happen again, I still deal with the company, I like the way they send my videos and cd's. They are very prompt and they package everything very well."
4,great movie not manufactured well,"I love the movie. However the movie company that released this movie on dvd needs to make a higher quality packaging etc. The stickers always ruin the cover art, the cases cuz cheap get damaged in transit all the time, etc. I shouldnt have to go search ebay or here to find a good case and I should have to order another copy just to get a good disc good case and good cover."
4,Geting even with dad~,I think it is a great movie but has some moments where there were bad langiuge.It was`nt any cuss words though.
2,more respect-less profanity,"I'm sorry to say that this movie was ruined by today's standard of decency. Its bad enough we can't protect our kids from the world but we really should be able to put in a pg movie and get good laughs not profanity and a complete lack of respect for the Lords house of worship. I was totally appauled with the actions in the church as if using the Lords name in vain was'nt enough. What happened to pg being 1 or 2 bad words and that was it. Todays standards are totally wrong. Years ago that would have been rated R. It would have been a terrific movie but they feel if there isn't a lot of cussing and bad manners no one will enjoy it, well they're dead wrong. Let's clean up the act for our future generation, after all what we put into the future is what we're going to get back. Feed kids garbage and what do you think they will produce?"
1,fodder,"extremely fair family comedy that highlights macaulay culkin's plunge into cheesiness. it's very unfortunate that such a talented child actor had to be forced down the tubes with fare like this and pagemaster. i guess you'll like it if you're a ted danson fan, but that's about it"
3,Wait a minute-I'm confused [...],"I have mixed feelings on this movie. Is the Culkin kid dude or woman? Its like he's both genders. I wonder if Ted Danson knows? I mean i know he's a dude in home alone and saved but then there's this and party monster and i think ""Is this Shlong, i'm watching or is this thing, this creature a Chic?Does anyone know? What happened to becker? Has anyone ever seen this movie? I guess not."
3,Woody Herman's World Class,"Recorded during a Tour in Japan in the 80s, World Class is a great record for people willing to get introduced to Herman's Big Band music. The Four Brothers, which is Woody Herman's anthem, is the opening piece, a buoyantly swinging atomic opus, brilliantly carried by a ""hall of fame"" saxophone section. Big band lovers, you should feel your hips swinging... Eminently talented musicians such as John Oddo, great orchestrater, Flip Philips, bop and cool sax player (The Claw, third piece, is one of his compositions), George Rabbai (who imitates brilliantly Armstrong's talents in the Old Rocking Chair) perform in a great shape. This record is definetly made for jazzophiles who want to enter Herman's joyous Herd."
1,Prestige Classic Lipstick - CL-78A Pout,"It arrived promptly. I have used this brand and color for several years. This lipstick has a bad taste and smell which others I have purchased last year do not - assuming maybe it is old / out of date. It also does not go on as smoothly as the others I have purchased in the same brand/color...again, assuming it is old."
4,Grand Hotel - Grand Recording,The original cast recording of Grand Hotel is grand indeed. Exellent orchestrations and as excellent cast. The emotion of the piece is conveye d thoroughly on this recording.
4,"Grand Hotel full of charelstons, fun.","Grand Hotel is full of charelstons and lots of fun! Brent Barrett is fine and so are the rest of the cast. ""Maybe my baby loves me "" and ""We'll Take a Glass Together"" are great!"
2,"second rate score, not worthy of the show itself","Grand Hotel was one of the most fascinating musicals of the 80's, a non-stop ballet brilliantly designed and directed. Unfortunately, the score is an absolute mediocrity. From the silly ""Some Have, Some Have Not"" to the pointless ballad ""Bonjour Amour"" to the derrivative ""Maybe My Baby Loves Me"" to any of the songs sung by the annoyingly throaty Karen Akers, this recording is simply irritating. The staging was the only good thing about this show, and that is something that cant be captured in a recording."
2,Not for me...,This was a rock not able to get any thing off it to help grip. Total waste of money....... It may have been just 40 years old and that was why but it was a waste of money for me.
5,Works Great.,"I bought the Viking 64 MB Smart Media card to add more data storage to my Olympus C-3020 digital camera. The Viking card worked perfectly without any format or setup. The price is much lower than other cards of similar size without any trade-off in performance.The extra memory this card provides allows for 82 pictures at the default setting in the Olympus Camera.If you have been trying to budget you shots with the small card that comes with the Olympus camera, I highly recomend this upgrade.It allows for more picture-taking fun without having to worry about running out of memory. ..."
5,Very nice add on.,"I bought this as an accessery for my husband's new digital camera. He is a serious, amateur photographer, and he is still raving about having the extra picture storage space. This disc has enough room for a full day's shooting, whether for fun or work. At 2 megapixel resolution it holds about 80 photos."
5,Do the math.,"I have been buying Viking in both SmartMedia and CompactFlash itinerations for the last 2 years. I've never had a problem and I find they are priced more competitively than the other leading brand. However, I always buy by the dollar-per-meg calculation, and currently this number should always be less than 1. Also, if you're looking to save $, shop the same card for a week or two and you might see some serious price fluctuations."
5,Excellent Memory Card at the right price,This card works well with my Olympus D380 Digital camera. Olympus only gives 8mb with their camera which would be about the equivalent of one roll of standard film. This memory card can hold 128 photos at high resolution and probably twice that at lower resolution. This would be the equivalent of 5 1/3 rolls of film undeveloped. And there is no compromise of image quality by buying this card. I'm 100% pleased with this
4,NOT BAD BUT ONE PROBLEM,"Ok so far so good I have had no problems.But one thing that I do not like is that,it comes with 5 songs on there already and you cant seem to delete them off the card and it takes up 2mb of space. I am paying for 64mb not 62 so I am pretty annoyed at this. But other then that it works great."
1,Incompatibility without software upgrade,"I purchased a Viking 64 Meg Smart Media card for use in my Olympus D-150 camera. It worked fine in the camera but when I went to transfer the photos to my computer via my FlashPoint Floppy Disk Adapter, the Smart Media card was not even recognized. Hence, I could not transfer the photos into my computer. My other Smart Media cards (Olympus and SanDisk) did not have this problem. I subsequently learned the Floppy Disk Adapter from SanDisk had upgraded software available for download which enabled 64 and 128 Meg cards to be read. The Viking card now works like a charm!!!"
2,Latin Made Not Simple,"I wanted a Classical Latin book and bought ""Latin Made Simple."" I beg to differ with the title! This book assumes you already have a lot of knowledge of Classical Latin and are able to jump in and move quickly through the material. If you already know Classical Latin and need a refresher, this would probably be a good book. If you're beginning your Classical Latin study, pass on this book."
3,Decent start to learning Latin,"I appreciate the author's efforts at creating a user-friendly Latin book. The author builds our confidence with constant examples of ""everyday Latin"", such as medical and legal terms, as well as proper names and state mottoes. I like the way he explained the different cases. I also liked the verb drills. However, there is not enough space in this workbook!!!! Everything is ""smooshed"" together. I wanted to use this book as a complete study, with the correct answers written right under the exercises. This book does not give any room for translations of long sentences!!!! The types in this book were fewer and further between than those in Italian Made Simple, thankfully!Due to the less than stellar quality of this book, I will not be purchasing any more from this series."
2,Synchronization Problems,"On the DVD edition, the voices are obviously out of synch with the mouth movements of the performers. Even though I don't understand Italian and was using the subtitles, I still found the synchronization problem to be very distracting.I first saw this film around 15 years ago and thought it was very pretentious. I decided to give it another chance, but didn't enjoy it any more this time. Although I realize it is a symbolic film, I still feel that Maltin's criticism, ""heavy-handed"", is very appropriate.Still, fans of Fellini will find this disc to be of interest, and you will be happy with the good picture quality (much nicer than the worn theater print I saw originally), and the fact that contrary to Amazon's description of ""full-screen"" format, the film is actually in letterbox format."
2,Mediocre and Pretentious,"Read Henry Miller and Louis Ferdinand Celine instead if you want to experience what a really good work of art looks and feels like.Fante try's but he rarely gets off the ground. The best part of the book is his description of life working at the cannery.This seems to me one of those first or second books an artist might write which he thinks is terific but looking back 10 years later realizes it is a ""work of youth"" and ""badly flawed"" if he is honest with himself."
4,Bandini rules,"This book contains several wonderfully memorable scenes, including the great battle against the crabs, the drowning of Bandini's women, Bandini's attempt to pile more than thirty boxes on a hand cart, and his sister's reaction to his silly novel. In addition, the book perfectly captures male lust and the delusions of grandeur that bites many male teenagers. All and all entertaining read."
3,Am I missing something?,"I first read Ask the Dust and loved it. Then Wait for Spring, Bandini--loved it to. Then realized The Road to Los Angeles is said to be a series for Arturo Bandini. But suddenly, in The Road, he has a sister and his mother's character is different. The tough father is missing. What happened to his brothers? I kept thinking I would find out, but after several pages it was still a mystery. And the decrease in writing style, well, I just couldn't go on any further to find out. No one seems to talk about this in any reviews I've read, so I'm puzzled. The change in family members...I had to stop reading. Maybe someone will give me a comment here and explain?"
3,Misleading Reviews,"I enjoyed this book in its own right, but my expectations for the book were not met because of the reasons that this book was recommended to me. I was told that this book would be very similar to ""A Confederacy of Dunces,"" which frequently produced laugh-out-loud moments during my reading. I found this book to be much darker, and though the protagonists are probably equally outlandish, Ignatius' behavior often came across as light and humorous to me, whereas Arturo Bandini appeared tortured and to be pitied. Clearly, a book with a tortured protagonist does not limit its quality, but I suppose that the mindset that I had coming into this text [that of a lighter comedy] caused me to have mixed reactions towards it."
3,"not perfect, but good price","The corner of the book's cover was bent and had black scuffs on it when it had been advertised as brand new, however for such an incredibly low price this feels like a minor mishap."
2,Terrible,"What a worthless read. I was tipped off to Fante by way of Bukowski, ""[his] god."" Ask the Dust was all right, but I found this book to be very bad. No alternate meaning there, just plain BAD. Fante's narrating protagonist is super pompous and annoying throughout the entire thing. There were maybe one or two vaguely funny incidents, but aside from those, the novel is a painful BORE. If you want a taste for Fante, try Ask the Dust, which is similarly arrogant, but much milder. Don't waste your time with The Road to LA."
5,A great reading experience!,Maeve Binchy has got to be one of the best ever authors.I read Circle of Friends and I was hooked. Her characters are so real and she makes even everyday life exciting to read about.
2,Circle of Friends,I have started this book but just can't seem to get into it. Will try another time.Seems a little predictable.
4,Circle Of Friends,"I have not finished the book yet, but so far it is proving to be as good as all the other books by Maeve Binchy. My plan is to read as many of her books as I can, I just love the stories she tells, the people could be your next door neighbor."
3,Pleasant read but disappointing in portrayal of intelligent women,"This novel was a fine way to pass a few days at the beach, but disappointed me in its lack of interest in the intellectual life of the women portrayed. Perhaps Irish college women in the 1950's were all at uni to hunt for boyfriends and husbands, but somehow I doubt it. The rigors and sacrifice to send a daughter to college were not insignificant. There was no mention of the protagonists studying, learning, or discussing their academic subjects. The book focussed solely on their pursuit of men and their social lives, and the social lives of the townspeople of Knockglen, the home of the two main characters. Yes, I understand it was a different era, but these women were otherwise so well portrayed and in nearly 600 pages, there was not a whit of intellectual depth drawn in any of them. It left the novel feeling a little shallow and soap-opera like to me. Still, an enjoyable read with sympathetic characters."
3,"Mostly Good, But One Glaring Problem","I enjoyed the book but there is no way a character like Nan would have gone after Simon once it was clear that he was living beyond his means [shabby home, etc]. Further, the way he neglected his sister should have shown her how he would treat her. Add to that their religious differences & it was clearly impossible.The plot could have been fixed by Jack cheating with someone else & Nan being unable to find a good catch or whatever."
4,Very Lovely...,"I am a big Binchy fan, and ""Circle of Friends"" is my favorite novel of hers. Very lovely story..."
5,The bonds of friendship which would last forever,I loved this book. It brought you into the life of other people and told a story of true friendship. No matter what happened they were there for each other. This book was great and I took every free minute I had to read and finish it. I was very disappointed after the book was over because it was such a wonderful story but I'm heading for more of her books:).
4,One of her best,"Maeve Binchy has such a beautiful writing style - if you're familiar with her other work: Firefly Summer, Light a Penny Candle, etc. you won't be disappointed."
4,Very Enjoyable Read,Maeve Binchey takes you on a fun journey of friendship and social class friction in this delightful story. She is wonderful at developing characters you will cheer with and feel compassion for.
5,Holds up to a reread!,"I just finished rereading this book for an online book group and have to say I loved it even more this time around!! The characters, the descriptions are timeless! I think there is a little bit of Benny, Eve and Nan in each one of us and that is what makes this book such a treasure--an accessible bit of comfort food to cure what ails you."
1,i thought it was more of a square,"let's not confuse ourselves, maeve binchy is the bomb! My grandma likes this book, my grandma also used to ask me how many black people were in my classes at school."
1,Too Many Characters and BORING!,"I couldn't make it all the way through this book. First of all, there were too many characters in it in order to really enjoy the book, and second of all, you wondered what would happen next, and nothing about it was exciting at all. This book has definitely been overrated for sure.Binchy writes with so many characters in this book, that you catch yourself wondering who's doing what sometimes.I wouldn't recommend it if you really want something entertaining and exciting to read."
4,Slightly predictable at the end of the novel,"This is a very good book about friendship and chosing your friends wisely. I found the first 100 pages to be a tiny bit slow, however, the novel picks up speed as the story progresses. I found that some parts of the novel seemed unnecessary and could have been editing out. Still, the story is a good story which I think teaches the lesson of choosing friends carefully, and choosing friends for how much they care about you rather than how much they care about themselves. Good book with a slightly predictable ending and a great lesson in what is important in a friendship."
5,better than the movie,Its been a while since I read this but there are still many parts that I will always remember. This was the first book of Maeve Binchy's that I read and since then I have read probably a dozen more of her works and still find this one as the best!
5,This is the best book I've ever read,"I've never read a book over 280 pages, but in just a few days I'd already read almost 300 pages of this book. I can't believe how I just turned pages and read for hours at a time without even realizing it. This has to be the best book I've ever read."
5,A rollercoaster of emotions that leaves you wishing for more,"Before reading this novel, I watched the movie. I ordinarily try to do just the opposite. I found that I enjoyed the book more than the movie. The ending of the story in the book is empowering for women and leaves you with something to think about, not just the happy ending we all crave to witness on the big screen. Binchy's characters are alive and vibrant throughout the plot, causing the reader to experience true feelings towards them. I believe that there is a bit of Nan, Eve, Benny and even Sean in all of us. These characters force one to recognize that. Perhaps Binchy's story forces a subcouncious moral into the reader's mind. All in all, I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates love and friendship."
5,"The book was captivating, the movie was tripe . . .",I've read this one again and again . . . it's like a snug quilt and a warm cup of tea on a blustery day. Few writers can create characters the way Binchy can. A pity they had to make a movie of it. Maeve Binchy is the antithesis of Danielle Steele - and thank God for that
5,One of the best books I ever read!!!,"I absolutely adored this book! It had everything; rich discriptions, sadness, joy, love, betrayal, and especially the beautifully developed characters. The characters were so real; I was able to relate with some and feel strong emmotion for them. I honestly bawled my eyes out throughout the course of this book, and I am just as effected every time I read it. I highly recomend this book to anyone in the world who has ever fallen in love, lost a loved one, had a best friend, been a child...for anyone who is human! Read this book, it's pure bliss!"
5,Circle of Friends,"In Knockglen, Ireland during the 1950's, Benny Hogan and Eve Malone encounter several hardships as best friends and as young women. Benny is attending courses at the University of Dublin, while Eve works and studies. Benny is 'large,' shy, and kind, while Eve is dark, thin, and 'bird-like'.The two meet the beautiful and flawless Nan Mahon (who's father is a drunk) and the handsome rugby player Jack Foley (who comes from a family of prestige) during their university years, and many situations arise. Though the intentions are not made, both Nan and Jack place Eve and Benny's friendship into catastrophic areas. Through love, hate, betrayal, and jealousy, Eve and Benny work as pair, with Eve stoutly defending Benny, and Benny teaching Eve forgiveness."
4,Very enjoyable,"I decided to purchase the novel, after watching the movie with Minnie Driver, and I have to say that I really enjoyed the read, I literally had to fight myself to put the book down at night so that I could get some sleep, and as soon as I was up I was back into it. The characters are well developed and I personally saw myself in Benny and her struggles to figure out who she was, and what she wanted. If you have watched the movie, don't read the book with the expectations that the movie and the novel go together, they don't. If you are interested in reading this book, go ahead, you won't regret it."
2,It was pretty lousy,"This book was kind of boring. It dragged on and on. I couldn't wait to get to the end, but when I did I wished I'd never read it. The ending is pretty lame. I don't suggest it to anyone."
3,OK,"This product is OK, I used it in a mixture to create a coat growth formula. Basically, if you look at the ingrediants of this product it mostly contains soy bean products and not much else. It is working OK in a combo with my other products, but I am not impressed that it does not contain many ingrediants, just soy products. I like Show Stopper much better as it contains many different types of meat and oil products as well as fruits and veggies. You aren't getting much for your money for this product."
3,"GANDALF 6"" Action Figure (2001 ToyBiz)","I was 13 years old 51 years ago. I like this toy-his staff, ""Light of Arnor"" and sword, ""Glandammering"" are both very realistic.Five stars accross the board. But I bought this for my grandson, six years old and not too familair with Tolkin's Trilogy. Still, he loves to play with this and similar figures from the ""Trilogy""."
1,Unusable. Range nowhere near claimed limits.,"I mounted the remote rain sensor less than 25 feet from the main uniit and the remote temperature sensor less than 50 feet away in a visible straight-line run. (The temperature sensor was visible through a window, main unit resting on window sill.) Brand new alkaline batteries. Unit failed to maintain communication to both sensors. It works when everything is together on the bench; when you set it up it fails miserably. I'm returning it and will try the Oregon Scientific model instead."
2,Inaccurate,"On the plus side, the bubble makes it easy to level. And I've had no trouble with the distance from the main unit to the remote.On the minus side, it is grossly inaccurate...as much as 25%. Usually records on the low side, but occasionally also records on the high side. Also, too many screws to get to the batteries in the main unit.Oregon Scientific is much more accurate, but after a while (one year for one, three years for another) it stops working and no troubleshooting works. La Crosse suffered the same fate."
1,Honeywell TC150,It is a piece of Chinese junk. I am surprised this product bears the Honeywell name. The outside temperature reading is 10 degrees higher than the real temperature. The rain readings are inaccurate. Only the clock and the indoor temperatures work well. The rain gauge readings quit working and are now dashes and I can not reset them. Very expensive for just a clock and indoor gauge. I don't want to spend more money returning it because I will probably get another piece of junk.
4,rain gauge,"I bought this gauge as a gift for my father-in-law, so I don't know how well it works. It was delivered on time. I chose this one because it keeps info. for 7 days. I really hope it works well for my father-in-law. He seems to like it."
2,Not from Beretta,This is not from Beretta - so beware. Will it do? Yes. Is it worth the money I spent for a Beretta knockoff? No.
4,Good Beretta CX4 Rail Kit - Recommended,"Installing the Beretta ""Bottom & Side Accessory Rail Kit"" adds a lot of additional rail space to the CX4. Here are my observations:* Easy to Install; Snaps into place and holds well with included hardware* Good Quality; Despite being made of plastic, this is tough enough to handle metal accessories* Mine had a ""spur"" left over from the injection molding process (see picture in ""Customer Images""), but it snapped off cleanlyAdding a grip\bipod, a flashlight, and laser sight to this accessory can make your CX4 look like something from a Sci-Fi movie, but it is good to have options.Recommended!CFH"
2,Hyper bulb burn out,Nice and bright but In ten mints the Hi beam filament burned out and then the low beam filament burned out good thing i carry an extra bulb in the glove box.
1,it had the missions and how to...,it had the missions and how to... But it had nothing that you could not think of your self or find on the internet for free.
3,My Medical Assistant,The Medical Assistant I ordered in January of 2012 did not have an up-to-date calendar. The calendar was 2008 to 2011.I called a number of times with no response. I was very disappointed.
2,Metal Bird Feeder,"What attracted me to this bird feeder was the design as well as the fact that it is all metal and easy to clean. However, I was very disappointed with it because it has been up for two weeks in my yard with black sunflower seeds and none of the birds have gone near it. They are sparrows and other city birds and they are all around except on this bird feeder. I also realized now that the only way for the birds to get to the seeds is through the mesh and I don't know if that is a problem for them to feed through the mesh. The other bird feeders I've seen open up when birds land on the perch and they can easily get to the seeds. I would like to return this bird feeder to Amazon and get a different one."
2,Cardinals no-squirrels yes,"I bought this feeder because I have several cardinals who eat at my other feeders. The cardinals do not seem to like this feeder. They seldom eat from it. they usually eat at my tube feeders. On the other hand, the neighborhood squirrels do eat from it and my wife and I love to watch them hanging off it as they get the seed out."
3,Feeding feathered friends,"It holds some basic type seeds, however not the smaller seed for special type birds! Smart squirrels can maneuver the top, even though there is a gadget to hold it closed. The price was okay and I hope it lasts."
3,"The birds love it, but so do the squirrels.","I purchased this bird feeder based on the fact that it was supposed to be squirrel-resistant. I guess the squirrels didn't read the product descriptions. They can actually hang from the mesh of the basket. And can empty the feeder in a day.To be fair , the birds also love it"
4,Needs Modifying,"I bought a similar feeder at Lowes for half the price. Works well for clinging birds such as nuthatches and chickadees. If you want birds like Cardinals to visit, you have to modify the feeder. We tie wrapped two sticks so the cardinals could perch and relax. Huge hit in our backyard."
3,Smaller than envisioned,"Nice feeder, but expected, somehow, for it to be taller. Dimensions were provided, so my mistake. So far no bird visitors."
5,No No Bronze Original Bird Feeder - birds love it!,"The squirrels were a real problem with my first one, which hung from a shepherd's crook. I now have a very tall bird-feeding station with a large baffle. As long as I keep the trees trimmed, the squirrels cannot access the station. I'm ordering a second feeder, because it was so popular with the birds in my yard."
2,gone in a day!,"Those little furry grey birds,the ones with the bushy tails,will hang up side down on this feeder and work every sunflower out of the mesh liner in less than a day.It takes about a week to figure this out.So the first week it works fine until the mesh wire lossens up."
3,There is a better feeder available,"The birds seem to like this feeder until it rains. When the sunflower seeds get wet, they swell slightly, making it very difficult for the birds to extract them from the feeder. My neighbor has the hourglass shaped feeder made by the same manufacturer and it seems to attract more birds than mine. It screen design does help alleviate the uneaten seed all over the place."
2,A bit disappointed,"I purchased this feeder and the similar red cardinal feeder for my husband's birthday in June. The birds love both! My disappointment with this one is that the top rusted before the end of summer. No rust on the red cardinal feeder. And, for some reason, the bronze feeder is the one that the squirrel visits."
4,Montana Bride by Catherine Lanigan,"Description from the book back cover:Austin Sinclair was used to the fast lane. Still, he admired rancher Monica Skye's need to protect her land - and her virginity. But after sneaking a peek at her scantily clad, luscious body and coming face-to-face with a double-barrel shotgun, he realized he had a lot to learn about his virtuous neighbor ... When would Austin get the message? Monica was tired of men trying to run her life - and her heart. And though Austin's kisses were enough to knock her Stetson clear across Montana, she wasn't about to let the city slicker get too close. Still, the nights were growing cooler - and the heat between them was enough to keep the fires burning ... a very long time!"
3,"Ok, but not a favorite",This is a cute ride-on toy. It looks like a tricycle without pedals. We ordered this for my daughter's first birthday but did not open the box until months later as she wasn't ready for it at a year old. At 19 months she is getting more interested in ride-on toys but this one is not as much fun as other ones she has. The wheels seem tight and it is not easy for her to push. All she does is put toys in the basket and sit on it for now. Maybe this will be more fun outdoors when she is a bit older...
3,Oldie but Goody,"It's an old book. I knew when I was buying it that the condition would be questionable. I still just ahd to have it to complete a collection. Within two reads the binding split, but the pages themselves are not damaged. In fact the illustrations and colorization are near perfect and brought back many childhood memories. It's always a gamble buying an old childrens book but I'm glad I did it."
5,Yeah this one is great,"You gotta read it, 5 stars, it goes really fast and it's so exciting. Big conspiracy in this one. A little scary in places, even. The author-to-reader dialogue of Findley is precious. Unfortunately, Findley died in his early 30s of a heart attack. Don't be mistaken -- his novels, placed in this ""mass market series"" are real art."
5,Excellent,"After being introduced to Shadowrun last year, I had been meaning to start reading some of the related fiction for some time. After scouring the internet, I decided on my first two books on the basis of their reviews: 2XS, and Never Deal with a Dragon. 2XS was far and away the better of the two.As both a book and a tie-in to the Shadowrun universe, 2XS is exceptional. The characters are engaging and believable. The plot is riveting, but without the confusion that comes from characters double- and triple-crossing each other. And the setting! It's more than just a few place names- be the end, I felt like I knew the places and people of Seattle in 2052 like I'd been there myself.If you already know about Shadowrun's Universal Brotherhood organization, you can expect to have a little bit of the mystery given away. However, I didn't find that to diminish the suspense in the least.I'd highly recommend 2XS for both newbies and veterans of Shadowrun."
5,Very Effective,"This fungicide was very effective on my tomatoe plants .I thought they were dead, now they are green and lush with blossoms...FANTASTIC."
4,The Ring Bearer,this is a great figure and is very fun 2 play with. the only problem is that the feet are in bad posture and the face isnt as detailed as other LOTR figures.
5,"Great to play with, and Great to admire","This action figure is wonderful. Excellent detail makes it very realistic and very similar to the character in the film. It is great fun to play with, and expecially with the stand, it is a good display item for all to admire. This is a well made toy and even comes with the One Ring!(made of plastic). It would suggest this toy to anyone who enjoyed the movie and/or the books. This toy truly embodies the spirit and character of Frodo Baggins!"
1,This is a junk. Please do not buy.,"The appearance is good, but the wireless switch flickers back and forth even if I am not touching the swtich. I think it may be causing it because of the interference from wireless devices around my home. I was unable stabilize it and could not use it at all. Did not want the hassle to return the product and thrown it out. I will never by Belkin product again."
3,RF Interference,I replaced a wired IOGear KVM with this Belkin wireless Flip. It has worked much better than the IOGear (They sent 2 which didn't work before I gave up on them).I noticed others mentioning random switching and have something to add on that. Every day mine switches around lunch time and again around 4:30. When I look out my office window I see the same Red Hyundai Elantra drive out right before/after this happens. Every time.This is a small parking lot but the driver obviously works in my building and always parks near enough to trigger. Imagine if you work next to a parking garage! I contacted Belkin via email - will post what happens...
1,"Interesting idea, useless result","When you see this it seems like an interesting item, one less cable to deal with. However, this switch will switch on its own and sometimes it will not switch at all! The solution provided by Belkin? Disconnect the video, audio and usb from both computers and re-connect. Yes, it solves the problem, until it happens again, sometimes a few times a week. If I wanted to connect and disconnect cables from the back of the computers I would not need a KVM switch in the first place...."
2,Belkin KVM Switch,"It never worked properly, I sent it back; can not recommend it which is a shame because other Belkin products I have used worked fine. Fini."
1,Plz get a wired one!,"I loved wired version. It's fast, easy, and good design.So, why not try wireless version? I could get rid of one tiny wire! ;-pI bought it even though most of the reviews were negative.Well, now I ubderstand that those reviews weren't from just angry people who doesn't know how to use it.This wireless version IS NOT WORKING! just like other people said in their reviews. I don't have to say it again. I hate the fact that Belkin still selling this defective product.Get wired one!I switched back to wired one, and happy again."
1,Not as advertised,The product looks really nice with pretty curves and pleasing colors. The wireless connection is reliable. But the switching time is around 5-10 secs which is a deal breaker for me because I switch between machines often. Also I have 2 monitors so I only need to switch between keyboard and mouse. I found a software which does KM switching just as I wanted. I can move my mouse from 1 machine to the other seamlessly.
1,self-flipping kvm,when it does not flip on its own its pretty cool. Only problem is that it switches to the other computer at will at the most inopportune times. Very frustrating. Not recommended!
1,Boring,"Eugenics is a fascinating and horrifying episode in America's history, one that deserves much more attention than it has received so far. But Bruinius's reporting and writing have so many shortcomings that he manages to turn an astonishing topic into a rather dull book."
3,"""Better for All the World : The Secret History of Forced Sterilization ...","I was unaware of these disturbing historical events until quite recently, which is why i sought out this book. It seems well written and documented. I have not finished reading this yet and plan on sharing it with friends."
4,Interesting and informative,"I picked this book up on a whim, since the subject matter caught my eye. It is very interesting the things that have taken place in America and the push for perfection that we still see today. I never knew this mass sterolization took place so all of this stuff was new to me. I think the book was actually very good. I would definitely suggest it to others."
1,Wait for Lombardo's book,"Paul Lombardo, a leading scholar on bioethics and eugenics, is workingon a book on this same topic. According to his bio page, the workingtitle is ""Better for All the World: Eugenics, the Supreme Court andBuck v. Bell."" I'm guessing professor Lombardo will have to change thetitle of the book now that Bruinius has published one with the samename, but whatever he calls it, it will be worth the wait. Lombardo'sprevious work on eugenics is brilliant and Bruinius' is, well,anything but."
1,Intellectually Dishonest,"There is a big problem with ""Better for All the World: The 'Secret' History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity."" That is, of course, that the history of forced sterilization in America is no secret. Many outstanding scholars have done extensive research and brilliant contributions in this area: Black, Lombardo, Carlson, Kevles, etc. Bruinius seems to be determined to ignore most of their work, an attitude that is incredibly arrogant, not to mention intellectually dishonest."
5,Impressive,"All that social history should be. In addition to the scholarship, this book has depth, nuance, and literary elegance."
1,"All in one roof, but presentation very poor","I agree with the review by Arthur Fischer. Papadimitriou mightbe an excellent researcher, but his communication skills arehopeless and horrible. The typos make learning even harder.Perhaps someone like Michael Sipser should take up the task ofrewriting this book."
4,More understandable examples perhaps ???,Things like complexity is difficult to understand.I had a course based on this book and - althought I found it interesting - still was difficult to understand.More examples - for better understanding - would be valuable.
1,terse grad school textbook,"I bought this book after reading a review describing it as a good book on algorithm complexity. What I didn't know was that the book states in the preface: ""This book in an introduction to the theory of computational complexity at a level appropriate for a beginning graduate or advanced undergraduate course."" In other words, it is best used as part of a course where you'll have an instructor give a less terse version of what this guy is trying to say. I am a college educated software developer, so I've been exposed to logic statements, but I was expecting to find something of use for software development, rather then a formal college text book (think lots of Theorem / Lemma / Proof sections followed by problem sets, etc). Clearly I am not the target audience for this book."
4,Good overall.,"A well-written book that teaches you how to think about complexity theory instead of just a flat summary of results. Something like Lewis and Papadimitriou's _Elements of the Theory of Computation_ would be more than enough preparation for this (note that the style of these books is quite different- this one is more informal and descriptive). Covers all the material you need in a first text. Has a good little introduction to mathematical logic in it, including a nice succinct version of Godels Incompleteness Theorem. Lots of interesting exercises."
2,Better than nothing,"It may be the only option to protect your Braun screen, but it doesn't fit properly and therefore must be held on with a rubber band. It has also developed a huge number of stress fractures as if it's been stepped on, which it hasn't. Better than nothing, especially given the price of replacement screens, but wish it fit better."
2,Not quite the same as original,"Not the same as original, very small and keeps popping off of the foil it's to protect. Even though I purchase a new foil and cutter."
2,Shaver Cap,"Works great. If not an original Braun its exactly like it. Problem is, shipping cost is about double the cost of the part."
2,Not informative at all...,"I just reviewed another book by Vicki Caruana and said basically the same thing. She has a bland writing style and goes on and on without saying anything in my opinion.There are better books out there so save your money. I recommend Lisa Whelchel's book called ""So you're thinking about homeschooling"" it is truly inspiring."
1,This sucks!,"I don't know why I wasted my time watching this.. It tries to twist your mind into believing Jackson is guilty. For me, I cannot take the DVD's word so I done my own research into the court case and everything and I am 99.9% sure Michael Jackson is innocent.. There was no evidence to prove he was guilty etc etc"
1,Old Chocolate,Not so old that you can't eat them but if you're going to give this as a gift I'd say pass - the chocolates themselves look like last years batch!
1,Broken Box Overpriced and Unreturnable!,This was the biggest rip off... I found the same thing at the grocery store for 8 dollars less and am retarded for not knowing it was expensive on here. The plastic contain that the chocolates are in is cracked and scratched/dented all over...not very presentable at all.
4,Lovely,I have always been a fan of Ferrero Rocher and this pack did not disappoint. I took off one star because the plastic box was cracking making it unsuitable for gifting.
5,Yummy,"Well, this new box of chocolates is on its way, but my husband brought home some of these from NY and they are delicious. A crisp outer shell with soft, yummy stuff inside. I am getting these for Father's Day, but they will be shared!!!!!"
2,Delivering chocolate,"Horrible, chocolate was melted when received. Not in a good condition at all. Delivery was a week. I hoped it would have been not melted, it wasn't as great as it was melted."
3,Wouldn't Send as a Present :(,"I love the product. However the gift box was broken and the individual chocolates a bit beat up. I'd be ashamed to offer this item as a gift. This will be a family treat. Oh, the gift box was not a flat one layer as pictured.UPDATE: Item image now represents the gift box. However cracked, chipped boxes are still sent out BUT the candy still is good! Watch out ordering during the heat wave so you don't get melted mush."
1,Not What I thought.,"I thought I read that these had soft centers but were hard throughout, thus why I gave it one star."
2,A touch too kitsch,"I've missed the point, perhaps. Didn't the Rebel Pebbles do this seventeen years ago?"
3,Good Ideas,"This book has a lot of great ideas and gives you a good perspective of the restaurant consumer. However, if you're looking for a guide to put together a marketing plan or program, you'll find your inspiration here but nothing else to actually implement it."
4,"Good fun, but ""Going to the Zoo"" is better","We play this album, on average, once a day-mainly because my 18-month-old loves it, but also because I think it's fun to listen to. (It's a nice change from ""I'm A Little Teapot"" type kids' songs.) Many of the best songs-Going to the Zoo, Allen Gator, Englebert the Elephant, At the 'Quarium-are also on the wonderful ""Going to the Zoo"" album. If you have to choose between the two albums, go for the latter, which also includes ""The Marvelous Toy"" and ""Suppose My Toes Were Noses."" The only great song on this album that isn't on GTTZ is ""Dinosaurs At Play."""
5,Good Writing,This is a good account of a period of time when fear was on the minds of Americans.How one man was in control.
4,A very good review of an era,"This is an extensive history of the era that shaped McCarthyism. The author traces the origins of anti-communism and America's struggle against radicalism. It starts with the first world war and ends with the censure of Senator Joe McCarthy. Those who are looking mainly for information about McCarthy will be disappointed, since he is not the main focus of this book."
1,Incoherent,"If you like your history to read like a high school term paper, this might be for you. Incoherent and grammatically bizarre sentences within an unfocused and rambling framework made this impossible for me to get through."
2,"Poorly Written, Boring","I had to force myself through this book although I am usually an avid reader of 20th century US history. It's just a boring book, although it may be a good survey through the Red Scare."
5,Great set of dice,"The detail of the dice are impectable, the weight on them are good and multi language insignias are a good feature to the dice"
2,Wrong dices for us.,"When we ordered I was expecting Spanish dices. There is nothing like the real Spanish dices to play a game of Cubilete. We returned and found the real Cubilete dices ""Spanish"". Amazon was very good about the whole process."
3,Novelty of Cards,"If you are tired of cards, are on a plane or a boat and just want to do something different, these are great. We had fun with them but they really won't replace a good deck of cards. They could be a good gag gift too."
1,This was horrible!!!--SPOILERS!!!!!!!!,"I was shocked when I came online to see the reviews for this book and saw that it had a high average. I rarely write reviews unless I feel strongly about the book. I feel strongly here, unfortunately it's negative. Theresa was a horrible person, I had a hard time liking her. She was a snob. And I don't understand why Michael would pine for her for TWO years!! Why?? Because she said something witty to him once? Give me a break. She was horrible to him. They aren't even dating during the book. At all!! One date, then in the last few pages they get together. Huh? I know we're supposed to feel sorry for her, and I did to a certain extent, but I don't think that excused her behavior. I couldn't get past that. I enjoyed Body Check and this was a great disappointment to me."
3,Not as good as the first,"I really enjoyed Martin's Body Check, but found Fair Play so-so. The hero was adorable, but the heroine was rather irritating. Her determination to like the ""other"" guy and overlook the perfect guy didn't make sense to me, even after it's explained. It seemed the heroine didn't learn anything from the incident in Fair Play (don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read the first book) and still doesn't look beyond the surface until it's almost too late, and only after the ""other"" guys flaws become glaringly obvious. Her attitude towards Italian Americans (even though she is one) was annoying and didn't really seemed justified by her childhood or anything else revealed in the book."
2,Disappointing!,"I truly enjoyed Deirdre Martin's first book, Body Check. The characters were engaging and the storyline very good. When i saw Fair Play on the shelves at the bookstore, i eagerly snatched it up and dropped everything to read it. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. This book was awful! The heroine was a jerk, and if she were a man in any other story, no one would tolerate her. Theresa was rude, arrogant, and tbe ultimate snob (i could use a few choice other descripters, but i'll keep this clean). she treated her family horribly. i depised her. on the other hand, i found michael to be charming and entirely too good for Miss SNOB. i was so frustrated with the way he pined after this loser for so long and how he tolerated her treatment of him. He deserved SO, SO much better.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Disappointed,"It's hard for me to enjoy a book when I don't like one of the main characters. In this book Theresa was so annoying! One minute she likes Michael the next she doesn't want to be with him. By the end of the book, I was hopping Michael would hook up with someone else. He deserved someone better than Theresa. There is also too much suffering going on (a la Danielle Steele) that it was depressing. Michael's parents are dead, the coach from the previous book BODY CHECK is dead, Theresa's dad has cancer...I have to say I LOVED the previous book BODY CHECK. That one I would give 5 stars. This one I'm sorry to say only gets 1."
3,Boring book ¡¡¡¡¡¡,"Sorry Deirdre , but l think this book is boring ; ""Body Check "" is a much better book than ""Fair play """
2,Just not as good as its predecessor,"Michael Dante has had a crush on Theresa Falconetti for years. A member of the rag tag hockey champs - the New York Blades - he has recently taken over his family's restaurant. He hires her to do PR for the restaurant since she won't give him the time of day since he is from the old neighborhood - and a hockey player.Theresa is the partner of Janna, who captured the heart of the team captain, Ty from ""Body Check."" It is nice to get an update on life in the Gallagher household, but much of the story is bogged down with her constant rejections of Michael, and his doormat tendency to chase after her, while trying to hold on to his position on the team.I had a hard time understanding his attraction. She was actually quite mean to him, and had an enormous chip on her shoulder for both her neighborhood, and her heritage. I thought he deserved better. And as a reader, I deserved a better follow up."
4,A great read,"This story is the second in a series of three, first being 'Body check', and a third to come 'total rush'. I really enjoyed this story. It's characters were thought provoking and complex. Deirdre handled the issue of Theresa's rape sensitively and realistically. Although it may annoy some readers, I think that it is quite realistic that Theresa only makes the right decisions at the very end of the book. If you know a rape victim, then what Theresa does in this book will not surprise you at all. An interesting and sweet story. I particularly liked the character Micheal, and I think that he makes the story a very good book indeed."
4,Fair Play,I have read both Fair Play and Body Check.. Both books are the best. I could not put both books down..Fair Play brings Theresa and Michael to life with powerful story lines for both of them and does a great job of keeping friends Ty and Janna invovled in to the plot from her first book Body Check.I did laugh and cry and can't wait for the next book...
2,One of the most frustrating heroine I've ever came across,"Excuse me for being obscenely blunt and harsh, but the ""heroine"" Theresa struck me as someone extremely annoying and almost brainless. Make up your mind already. She must be tremendously blind or just plain stupid if she just doesn't see how good of a guy Michael is. Granted she's had a traumatic incident years before but I didn't think it was enough to make up for her behavior. I felt sorry for Michael for having go through her loony bipolarity. He deserves much better."
2,"ehh, where's the romance?","I don't know about you , but when I read a romance novel it's to enjoy two people coming together and learning to stay together. These folks don't come together until 20 pages from the end of the book. I mean, good writing, good character development--but quite frankly the only spunk or sense of humor in the main female I saw, was when the guy referred to what he had seen in her in the past. I liked her a lot better in book one.Great male lead, but dud of a female lead whose quite slow on the uptake. I found her frustrating and tedious."
4,"A good story but,","Fair Play by Deirdre Martin was a good story for the most part but the back and forthing between characters got a little annoying after awhile. I like her first few books a little better than this one, but that's just one person's opinion. As a rule I really enjoy the stories written by Deirdre Martin."
3,Let down from Body Check,"Man, I finished Body Check and was so ready for the adventure to continue with the Blades. Unfortunately ""Mikey"" just wasn't of the same hunky caliber to make it that interesting for me. Instead of a romantic steam-fest this turned out to be a book dedicated to the New Year Italian lifestyle (Italian minutiae). I guess if I were of that background then I'd find it easy to relate. Three stars for continuing the storyline and for including the characters which I fell in love with from the first book."
2,"ok, but not great","this book was so hard to read.more than two thirds of the book, the two main characters weren't anywhere close.In fact, they will finally interact in the very end -- in fact you have to go to last chapter to see them interact.Good grief, I dont know if I want to read anymore of Ms. Martin's books. The first book,Body Checkhad a lot more substance than this book. I read that entire book in one day. I really wouldn't recommend reading this book after reading Body Check. It really is a disappointment book."
1,Not what the title suggests,I'm in a collaborative team teaching assignment. I assumed this book was about that - instead this book is about cross curricular teams working together. Not team teaching in one classroom.
4,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.,"Easy install, excellent performance. Just bought one and it was a snap to install with Windows 98. I didn't have to rely on the documentation, although there is enough info there to help if I needed it. I was connecting at 26,400 with my 33.6K modem. Now, with the Viking 56K modem, I consistently log on at 48,000 (nearly twice the speed). I've been told our phone lines are slightly noisy, and this modem's claim to fame is that it powers through line noise. I have to say that it delivered, given my new connection speeds. Viking has an excellent website with good user support and info. The modem has a 5 year warranty, with Viking promising to send a replacement immediately upon receiving a bad modem return. I paid a great price for it and with its strong performance, what's not to like?"
2,they roll down the runway but never take off,"an obvious attempt to ""go commercial"" lacking the grit and wit of earlier efforts. there's something very caucasian breeder about the funk and that ain't good."
2,"oh yeah, and debbie harry guests at age 80","Luscious Jackson do not have the funk. This might stop a less ambitious group from making dance music, but LJ gamely continue making grooveless booty-rock that wouldn't be so inert if they were more disciplined; if they chucked their drum programming; if their songwriting approach was less come-on and more payoff; or etc. Except for the Bananaramish ""Nervous Breakthrough,"" it takes determination to dance to this album. With the additional exceptions of ""Ladyfingers"" and the guitar-violin ballad ""Lover's Moon,"" it takes effort to listen."
2,No Vivian Trimble makes this record a major disappointment,"I waited and waited for the new album to come out, even after keyboardist vivian trimble left the band. I didn't think it would make that much of a difference, boy was I wrong. This doesn't sound like luscious jackson at all, every single song is missing the keyboards. I dunno if I am just biased toward fever in fever out, but this sounds like some album concocted with something else in mind. Gone is the surreal, relaxing landscape of ""Take a Ride"", now we have an album that has some kind of wierd beat to it, and it makes you want to move. Which if you have listened to fever in fever out, shouldn't be the case. Sigh, too bad amazon doesn't take returns."
3,Eagle of the Ninth,"Good little book I read in '59 9th grade English Lit.. reread over the yrs by myself, husband and sons.. Now it's coming out as a movie so we are rereading it as we do for many movies and my hard back started to break down so we ordered a replacement. Quality of this one is edgy as it's almost as old, but for the price we still appreciate it and more family members can enjoy Sutcliff's writing of historic fiction. it made us take advantage of other Sutcliff offerings on Amazon, so we will be broadedned by more English history!"
4,A Roman soldier's search for his father's lost legion.,"Captivating story of a young Roman soldier's search to find the Eagle and the fate of his father's lost legion, the Ninth Hispania. This was the first historical novel I ever read and it started my passion for Roman history that continues to this day. The fate of the Ninth Hispania has always been a mystery to Roman historians. Rosemary Sutcliff personalizes the story of how this legion may have met it's end and how a young man's love for his father drives him to search beyond the known limits of Rome to find the truth. One of the best books of a truly outstanding author. Intended for young readers it will be enjoyed by adults as well."
3,"quick read, but still interesting","This was apparently written for younger readers- it's very simple and not too complex. The premise is interesting, the characters are fairly well written, and it makes a logical ""explanation"" for some real-life facts."
2,Very dissapointing read,"I like reading and read a lot. This book is a big dissapointment . The story never really gets going and staggers along until it kind of dies somewhere near the end. Choked to death by boring flowery descriptions .The storyline is fluffy and soppy and does not in the least reflect the promise of the title. Instead of being a Roman warstory it is about the unconvincing relationship between two men . Nothing much warlike happens and it does not really convince as a war story or anything else. Most unforgivable, it is boring.This book is a mix of Bold and Beautiful meets Major Dad . A soapy in disguise. Read Cathedral by Nelson De Mille and experience the difference. Readers who give Eagle five stars obviously have not read much. I will not be reading Sutcliffe again."
3,"O.K. But Very Slow Moving, Tedious, and Hard to Read","Sutcliff does a good job in her storyline but the fault of the book is that she writes it in a sort of english vocabulary and roman grammer which makes it hard to read. For its age group, the book is long and slow moving."
3,good for beginner,"This book is Roman historical fiction that contains good morality and sagacity of roman ex-commander.Author uses simple and easy words. This story is easy to understand. And the plot is tight. It suitable for the beginning reader.But it watses pages for describe lot of things, so sometime it can make some boring."
5,Good fun fiction,Great discriptions of Roman military life and one of many possible endings for Legio IX. This is an interesting book for your library.
4,If you've already seen the movie...,"I watched to movie before I read the book. I know, shame on me. Anyway the only things the two have in common are the names and the basic premise. There was less tension between Marcus and Esca and some pretty big plot changes as a result. While I didn't like how the simpler relationship of the main characters the differences in plot were good because I didn't know what was coming next. It kept me from getting bored. Overall, it was a good book for younger readers or light reading for older ones."
5,the only way to learn history!,"if you read enough sutcliff, you have a good chunk of roman history and life covered! and you enjoy it too!!!"
4,Engaging,"The author draws you in with the note she makes about the inspiration for this work. It is a mystery that begs to be solved. My brain started to run around in circles of what she mentioned about the eagle and the vanished ninth legion. So it was inevitable that I would get hooked into the book from Page 1.In spite of setting up the protoganists on opposite sides, she focuses on the humanity of each one of them and their individual code of honour that binds them all into a family without any of them realising it!Her language is simple yet vivid and helps you empathise the evolution of the people through their experiences."
4,Good Great Plains Biology,"The book is well-written, has good personal experience & insight into bison and biology. The bison connection to other great plains flora & fauna is explained. A good read for bison behavior. I give this four stars instead of five because of the evolutionary angle the author takes."
4,Homespun On The Range,"Dale Lott is thoughtful, often funny and a gifted writer. The chapters on inter-herd behavior are the most useful for readers familiar with bison such as the ""domesticators"" (people keeping private herds) whom he castigates later in this easily read volume. Herd structure and dynamics are reviewed in a clear and concise prose. Chapters on the bisons' prairie neighbors such as pronghorn, prairie dogs, and coyotes while informative and even amusing, detract from the core narrative. Chapters on health and parasites could have been more inclusive. As keepers of a small private herd, we felt the gentle lash of Lott's admonishment and warning of the risks of domestication. He raises serious issues in a slim, well organized and informative book."
3,Meh..,"I like this action figure, but its no fun. it doesnt look like Laurence Fishburn. Just a stiff action figure that I had 2 have. Nothing special."
