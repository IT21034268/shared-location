5,Great addition to your collection!,This is the final season and one of the most entertaining seasons of all! A must have for your collection:)
4,"Good, but not the best","This bloopers video has a great concept--good bloopers and classical music.The music and bloopers go well together and often have humorous themes. It really helps. As good as bloopers are, they can get boring after awhile.The bloopers are good, but not great. Many of the bloopers are the same as the video Simply the Best--101 Sports. Most are funny.There are two problems with this video which cause it to receive four stars instead of five. One problem is that the video has few bloopers from professional U.S. sports, and instead gets bloopers from college, the CFL, and so on. While I'm at it, can I add for the record that rodeo ""bloopers"" are not funny? Seeing a bull rider being wrenched around by his arm for five seconds IS NOT A BLOOPER.The other problem is that the video is short--a mere 55 minutes.It is good for a bloopers video, and non-sports fans will still love it (except for the rodeo bit). Enjoy!"
5,Sweet!,Easy to use and awesome features. My home movies copied to Hard Drive then to Disk. Awesome. Love it!
1,worthless product,"I have a lot of experience with hooking up vcr's , dvd's , and pal ntsc converters. I have never in my life experienced the difficulties associated with this dvd recorder. It absolutely will not interface with my tv [I have a panasonic tv} The only way I could get this to even interface at all was by hooking it through the vcr which it says you are not supposed to do . you have to program the channels into it. What if you just want to use it to convert your vcr tapes on to dvd? I was not able to do this at all. It is a worthless piece of equiptment, and unfortunately since I have spent about 3 months trying to hook it up [without benefit of their technical service which is non existent} and now it is too late to return it. I am so disappointed, do not buy this piece of pooh."
1,actually deserve no star,"terrible screenplay, pretentious and horrible acting almost by every actors, especially the actress who played the bar owner. can't believe such absolutely no talent female could be an actress and played a major role in this flunky messy movie. the whole movie was like watching bunch of high schoolers staging a play in their school's auditorium. stay away from this horrible deadbeat."
4,gripping,"I read this book on vacation because I figured it would be a light read. I couldn't put it down. I was a little disappointed in the last few chapters because I kind of figured out what was going to happen, but it really held my attention."
4,Only one thing I didn't like...,"This was a great book and I really enjoyed reading it. I am a big Danielle Steel fan. I think she is wonderful. The one thing about this book that I didn't like was The way Marielle went from the detective, to the attorney at the end. She barely knew the Charles' attorney. Just seemed kind of a thrown-together-end."
2,Typical Danielle Steel,"I keep reading Danielle Steel hoping to find another Palamino. Once again I'm disappointed. The premise was interesting, but Ms. Steel fills it with ""woe is me"" characters. Thank goodness, I didn't spend money on this novel; it was lent to me by a friend."
1,I'll never read another Danielle Steel book again.,"This was my first Danielle Steel book and I am not ashamed to say that it is my last. I almost gave it two stars because I ""survived"" to the end, but it was disappointingly predictable- in plot line and writing style. I am glad that I read it though, because I will no longer be tempted to read another Danielle Steel title."
2,Boring!!!!!!,definitely not one of my favorites!!!! Slow and boring tale of a family whos son is kidnapped!!! Lindenburgh baby all over again!!!! Boring!!!!
4,One of Danielle's Best,I was really able to get into this book. And being a mother I can relate to most of Marielle's feelings. I would encourage any one to read this book.
2,A Custom Case????? 2 stars ... Overall 5 stars,"The product description clearly states that the case if specifically designed for the Sunpak 3300 Pro Tripod. Sorry, but I don't believe it. The tripod just doesn't fit, no matter how I've tried to cram it in.I unsecrewed one of the handles from the panhead (there are two) and squeezed the tripod into the bag. The unit is just too long. It almost wants to close, but it needs about another 1/2 inch of bag to close.This was a gift, so I'll probably just keep it and try to make it work.Disappointed to say the least. I had hoped to not have to unassemble the tripod for carrying... makes it more of a hassle for field trips.Other than that, the case seems really nice and I would probably rate it at 5 stars. If your tripod is less than 10"" in diameter at the feet, it should work well.If anyone has a suggestion on what I'm doing wrong, I'd sure like to hear!"
1,Cheap and flimsy,"I got this bag for my Sunpak tripod and it does not fit. It's WAY too short. The description says it's for tripods less than 24"" and the bag length is 24.2"". My tripod is 23.5"" and it's a really tight fit.The good:- Lightweight bag (since it's unpadded).- Handle looks comfortable but since my tripod didn't really fit, I didn't get to try it out in the field.The bad:- Bad fit. The description is waaaaay off. The case would be better for tripods under 22"", not under 24"". You need some wiggle room to make it easier to get the tripod in and out of the bag.- Cheap construction. The bag I received didn't even have the threads cut off. It's that lack of attention to detail that makes you wonder what else they skimped on. :-/This bag was cheap (I got what I paid for) and it wasn't even worth it to return it since I would have to pay for shipping and everything. I'll probably give it to a friend or something."
3,"It's alright, but a little small for my 23.3"" tripod","The material is pretty good and I appreciate the padding on the strap. It said fits most tripods less than 24"" long so I thought it would work with my Sunpak 6600DX that's 23.3"" long. I have to really fight with it to zip it closed. It'll close but it takes a little elbow grease. I'm sure it'd be perfect for anything 22"" or shorter."
5,Awesome swaddler,"I love this product. It allows you to truly secure your child, keeping him/her cozy and feeling safe (and minimizing startle reflex wake-ups), without forcing you to wrap very tightly and risk overbundling. The only downside is that your child might grow out of it quickly--it is not very long. I have heard of people cutting the bottom off so the child's feet can poke through, and continuing to secure the arms with the rest of the blanket, but I haven't done this myself."
1,This blanket is NO miracle!,"A Lot of people seem to swear by this blanket, but I have found it to be awful...certainly not a miracle!The one good thing is that it is soft and the blanket is a nice weight.My son hates this blanket...he screamed bloody murder every time I tried to use it. This eventually got better, but he is out of the blanket in a second. As soon as I put him down he is crying because his legs are out of the swaddle. He gets out of this as fast as a regular blanket. Because there is so much fabric wrapped around him, as he wiggles out of this is becomes really dangerous.I would not recommend this blanket at all!"
4,"Awesome for what it is, just don't get too attached",I used this for my son until he was about 6 months old. It was awesome - he fell right to sleep whenever he was in it since his flailing arms tended to wake him up. There's plenty of material to wrap around even the largest infant and it's easier to figure out than the whole swaddling with the regular blanket thing.Just know that eventually you're going to have to stop using it and the transition will take some time. My husband and I went through some sleepless nights after we stopped using the blanket since our son had to get used to sleeping without it.
4,Serious Swaddle Blanket,"This is one SERIOUS contraption. I will be honest, it seems a bit much for my newborn, but he sure does sleep for a long time. I find it difficult to get the arms under the arm flaps and said flaps under his back BUT I recognize that in a few weeks once he fills out and is having fussy evenings, I will be so glad I have it. I also have a Kiddopotamus & Co Swaddle Me that I just LOVE. It's organic cotton and I love the feel of it and the ease of swaddling my newborn in it. I would try both blankets."
1,One size does not fit all,"For a 6lb newborn this thing is not a good fit. I know it shouldn't matter since it's intended use is to be ""swaddled"" but even then the bottom portion that resembles a kangaroo pouch into which the legs are supposed to ""tuck in"" is way too HUGE and there is no real good way to make the babies legs snug in there so they are constantly moving. Back to using a regular blanket after having wasted $30 on this product. Also if your baby is like mine and loves to pacify himself using his hands (to his face and mouth), then having his hands taken away which is what the design of this blanket does he is going to hate it!!"
2,not all that it was cracked up to be,"Overall, it's a pain. It's hard to wrap the baby up without having any bulges or bumps in their back from the arm flaps and it is a pain to have to re-wrap them every time you have to change them. If you have a light sleeper you won't be able to do it without waking them. I really like the idea and it does swaddle but its inefficient and not really practical."
1,"The video and sound quality is terrible, what a shame!","Wonderful story, terrible quality picture and sound. Save your money. Set your VCR to Nick Jr. and make the recording yourself. The tape says it's from ""Paramount Home Video"", beware!"
1,I was sent Spanish version,Couldn't use because I am American. Cost to much to send back. Went into the trash. Will certainly not buy movies here again.
3,Too hard.,"I got this because my 5 yr old loves Superman and I saw on youtube that you can fly as superman. Well, as an 80's kids I have been playing video games since I was 8. And I cant even get past the training level in this. They have a bunch of meteors falling down on you and you have to destroy all of them before they hit the ground. My 5 yr still hasn't been able to play this yet. My 13 yr old took hours to get past the training level only to have a saving error occur (babys fault). Nobody wants to do the training level again so it is just collecting dust."
3,very repeative,This game has it's moments but as all the other reviewers said about fighting robot after robot after robot is true. Sometimes they throw a few flying creatures in the mix as well as some on the ground but it's the same thing over and over. I feel sorry for those that spent the $50 or more for this game when it came out because it's definately not worth it. I advise renting this one or finding it really cheap
2,hard to play...,No cheat code and trick at the begging level. Not a easy play game. You must pass the second level in order to use cheat code. But it's hard to pass the second level. I haven't get once successed yet.
3,Lost in a card game.,"Seth O'Connor had believed the lies about Josie McAllister and refused to believe the baby she was carrying was his child. Now, eleven years later, single mother Josie and her daughter discover that Josie's father lost the ranch to Seth. If they marry, Josie can retain half interest. Refuse and everything belongs to Seth.For next ranch neighbors, Seth and Josie seem to know very little about each other's lives. Yet Seth expected Josie to fall into his arms, after implying she was a whore. A good story that keeps your interest, once you get past some plot holes at the beginning."
5,Excellent camera bag!,"Vanguard really hit the mark on this one. A Canon Rebel body with a 50-300mm lens attached fits well in this bag, with extra room for a hood, remote trigger, and even a small flash. The quality is superb; once closed, no dust, dirt, or water can enter. This bag has kept my camera clean and dry through many extended outdoor adventures. The pockets are sized well and they are well placed on the bag itself. The bag is also extremely well padded so as to protect your expensive camera and glass!"
3,DVD,It was a good story & the quality was ok. Where it shines is Jessica Langes performance . She did an excellent job of lip synging! One of the best. Great songs!
4,Clang,"I just saw this and was impressed with Jessica Lange's controlled performance as Patsy Cline. Her work here is one of the best I've seen from her in a long while, but the weak supporting cast do nothing to help her out. Ed Harris is thoroughly wasted in a role that is both badly written and executed.Jessica Lange seems to do well in biographical roles, and as Cline she is thoroughly convincing. The only sore points in the film are the climax (the scene where Lange boards a plane and plunges to her death came too quickly and got over too fast) and the fact that Lange's doesn't lip-sync very well. I couldn't believe that it was she who was singing those songs, even if it wasn't really her, of course. On the other hand, the dialogue is good and the direction is great. Certainly worth watching. I am told that Jessica Lange was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for this film in 1986. She didn't win."
3,Good Movie - Missed DVD Opportunity,"Okay, I have to make an admission up front: This is one of my wife's DVDs - not one that I chose - but I watched it and I did enjoy the movie. However, this is not so much a review of the movie as it is a review of the DVD.The feature movie is quite good quality - the best version available to date - so I have no complaints there. My main complaint is that this DVD CRIES OUT for extras and there are none. This DVD could have footage of Patsy's old TV performances or interviews with the people who knew her or SOMETHING! But another DVD opportunity is wasted. Oh well!If you are a lifelong Patsy Cline fan, you will want this DVD. Otherwise rent it.Jeremy"
3,"Country songs by a country singer, at movie.","Patsy Cline is one of the most famous country singer at all.At this movie, you can see her life, and enjoy several very good songs, which made her famous.Very good performance of Jessica Lange."
3,sweet dreams,I enjoyed this movie very much. I've always enjoyed bio-pics and Patsy Cline. Others will enjoy this film too.
2,Mediocre Hollywood-ized biography. Run of the mill.,"This movie is about the life and tragic death of Patsy Cline, the great country singer. Unfortunately, it is a very routine Hollywood-ization biography, and is certainly nothing special. Also, from what I've read, Patsy Cline wasn't like this at all; she had more of a reckless personality, according to what I've read. Jessica Lange does a great job lip-synching Cline's recordings, but the script does in the movie. The only interesting thing in this movie for me was that I saw them filming some of the scenes, as I lived in Martinsburg, West Virginia at the time. Martinsburg is where they filmed the majority of the film. I enjoy watching the movie just to see things that bring back memories of Martinsburg for me (As they pan the city, for example, I can see the apartment building that I lived in). But for the majority of people, meaning those that never lived in Martinsburg, West Virginia, this movie is a waste of time."
1,Unable to comment because:,"This DVD only operates in region 1 (USA), so beware if you are buying for any other region - we are unable to view it and are very annoyed that it is not shown as REGION 1 on the sales sites of AMAZON. Absolute waste of money. especially as we bought 2 other DVD's at the same time also region 1 only."
1,THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THE FILM WAS THE MUSIC,"I am not an expert on Patsy Cline, but I am a big fan. And from all the interviews I've heard and the books and magazine articles I read, this film was very inaccurate. I don't know anything about the personal life of Patsy and Charlie when they were at home, away from the public, but how did the scriptwriters know, either? They weren't there.The plane crash, from what I heard, was portrayed inaccurately. I had read there was no fire at all; yet the movie showed the plane bursting into flames. This is just one thing that I noticed which didn't fit the real Patsy Cline story. I did not care for this movie at all. I am hoping that in the near future, Hollywood will decide to produce a more accurate, and better, film on the life of the great Patsy Cline."
5,Review for Sweet Dreams,Patsy Cline is a favorite...enjoyed the movie very much....All characters did a great job...just sad to see someone so talented have such a short life...
4,Patsy Cline,If you like country music this is a must have. There will never be another singer like her. It is such a warm and heartbreaking story of her short life.
2,Requiem: Avenging Angel,"Requiem: Avenging AngelThis was actually a above average game for its time.I consider one of the best games 3DO created.This fell under the shadow of bigger budget games were released that year.However this gem doesnt play well with a modern a OS.I consider my myself a highly skilled computer user.To me trying to get old games to run to on modern equipment and software is about as much fun to me as playing them.Especially DOS games with out using emulation.Anyay.Vista 64 is imposable to get running even in software rendering.XP is possible through software rendering.This is one of them older games that cant recognize newer versions of direct x.It is hell bent on using the version of direct x when the game was made.(direct x 6)The direct 3d patches wont install also.If your running Windows 98 yet or older,you shouldn't have a problem.Too bad the source code was never released.:("
1,Not water or dust resitant - Proprietary battery,"OK, first I want to talk to the genious who put the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone. You have to remove your headset to put the phone in the charger. Are you kidding me? At more that 3X the price of other brands, I expected a high quality phone but got this piece of junk instead. The description leads you to believe the case is ruggedized with rubber. Not so, there's a thin band of rubber on the edges only - other than that it's plastic everwhere. It also claims to be water and dust resitant. How is that possible with a cheap plastic back cover with a 1"" hole and no gasket? The voice quality is tinny when using the phone's speaker. There is a annoying delay when pressing buttons and the phone keeps ringing when you pick up an extension for a few seconds. And worst of all, it uses a proprietary battery. If you must have a Siemens phone get the S series that uses rechargeable AA batteries."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this set to replace my old Siemens set that was damaged in a fire. I was very happy with the original system, but I paid the same price for this set years after buying the first set. Usually electronics drop in price, so I figured this would be a nice set. Wrong! Has much fewer features than the original set. Overpriced for what little you get. Look elsewhere."
2,"Looks good, feels good, not very useful","Everything good, except it is difficult to use. Typing in numbers and names is difficult and the functions are not intuitive at all for Americans."
5,With contributions by both sociologists and economists,"In Networks And Markets, James Rauch and Alessandra Casella effectively collaborate to assemble contributions by both sociologists and economists to provide a coherent view of the role of economic incentives and established channels of personal relationships in the economic marketplace. The focus is on how social networks are an essential precondition for successful markets, and whether networks arise naturally out of markets as traders build reputations and gain confidence in one another through the history of their mutual dealings. Networks And Markets is strongly recommended and informative reading for economists and sociologists, as well as non-specialist general readers with an interest in how personal and professional relationships affect economic transactions on a corporate and governmental level."
5,convenient,"Since I received this sack he's been in the thing! He loves it more than his hassock and I love the fact that he wakes less than before, and he's climbing in order to get to it. Whereas before we had to bribe him to climb!"
5,Yes,"I was there and witness these things. It is a simple yet wonderful depiction of what happened. Whenever I need a lift or a reminder of what my practice is, I put on this video."
3,worth watching,i thought it sort of missed the point of yoga by focusing so much on famous people who didnt really have a lot to say - i would have loved more of the actual practice - it would have been interesting to have followed a beginner and see how they changed over the course of the month - it is still definitely worth watching - its great to see such a wonderful family and how they work together
3,Biased!,"If you know the Cold War was something involving America and Russia but not much else, and want to learn more then this is a good book for filling in the blanks and adding some meat to your bones. However, it fails to mention crucial facts like Russia felt it was more than justified in installing nuclear missiles in Cuba because America had done so in Turkey years before. Russians had lived under the threat of destruction at the hands of American nuclear missiles for years, yet America panicked and was outraged when they got a taste of their own medicine.This is a good book, but it is biased in favour of America, not mentioning the USA's faults.""What kind of a peace do we want?....Not a Pax Americana, enforced upon the world by American weapons of war!!""John F. Kennedy."
5,amazing honesty told in gifted prose,"I don't think I've ever read a more honest memoir covering such difficuly material. The author is unsurpassed in describing both his own, often bad, behaviors and the tough material of his family's life. Moreover, he shows very clearly what knowing ""the truth"" about family secrets can and cannot do.I have studied what is called ""the intergenerational transmission of trauma"" and this book describes one form of it better than anything I've ever read. I also found the author's style to be both learned and lucid, often bringing in material from various experts in the field. I recommend it to anyone who has had to deal with family secrets or trauma, either in one's own life or as a professional."
4,Why does it take so long to ship these?,I love Swaddlers but why on earth does it take 3-5 weeks all of a sudden to ship these diapers? Amazon will probably increase the price to $10.49 soon again ... Wait and see. I am waiting for my packages from 28 July onwards (it's 4 September today!).
4,Love them but...,I've tried several different brands of diapers but swaddlers won by quality and perfect fit.But what happened to $7.49 packages? A month ago I paid $7.49 for exact same pack of diapers.Amazon should reconsider their pricing strategy. If an item is popular DON'T RAISE THE PRICE! The same goes for Similac Advanced Formula with Iron. $4 increase in price overnight is ridiculous! Target sells it cheaper!
2,Product SIze and Quantity -- GREATLY DIMINISHED!!,"Don't be surprised, as we were, to find a completely different product when you open your formerly trusted brand and type of diapers; that what was an excellent product and a great value at 7 - 8 dollars (on amazon) has now shot up in price, all while the manufacturer has really cheaped out on the product. How? By reducing the _number_ of diapers in the package -- and by actually reducing the size!! The difference is so significantly smaller that we actually thought we had a size one diaper in hand. So, buyer beware. If you're looking for a great value, try CVS brand Ultra Soft-Stretch diapers. (No, I do not work for the CVS companies. Yes, I am really disappointed with a manufacturer like Pampers changing their price to product ratio so negatively.)"
2,"Great Product, but BAD AMAZON Service","I had ordered these MONTHS ago, the 46 pack for 7.49 each (I ordered 6 packs) it stated first 2 week waiting period, then a 5 week waiting period. I then after 6 weeks received NO notification and when I checked at my orders that the order ""Mysteriously"" disappeared, only showing that I had purchased some cetaphil lotion for the order number!Now now only has the size 2 package lost 4 diapers in their packaging, its added $3 more on TO IT??? Forget it, its not worth it, I'll go get the 204 count box size 1/2 at Sams club for $30 and save my time and energy!"
4,too long time for the shipping,I ordered the diapers on 8/21 and I am still waiting for them to be delivered at the estimated time of 9/28-10/11. Consider how quick the baby grows!
2,Be Aware of delivery estimate,"Theres no question that pampers are great. But be aware of the time it takes to get to you. I ordered on 12/14, free super saver shipping is supposed to deliver to me in 2 weeks. But the delivery estimate when I view my order is 5 to 7&1/2 weeks, which is ridiculous. When I contact the customer service by email (difficult to find the toll free, and when you call thers no way to speak to a live person), they say it will arrive sooner than estimated, so keeping my fingers crossed to get my order by 1/5 after which I will be on looong vacation (2&1/2 months) to ASIA. Cant cancel the order now as the status is 'Shipping soon'."
2,No want of better books on the subject,"This is probably the worst book on Group Theory a beginner could buy. If you're not a beginner, the book is dated and quite pedantic. The book lacks historic motivation, it lacks algebraic and geometric motivation, it lacks combinatorial and number-theoretic motivation -- so what then is it's motivation? Good question. It even lacks a comprehensive bibliography. If E. Galois was alive, I'm sure he'd ask for a duel with W.R. Scott for the pedantic way he's treated the subject. But don't expect to even find one paragraph about E. Galois in this book, It's utterly devoid of historic comment.I give this book two stars because it's a cheap Dover edition, and as such doesn't hurt the pocket book much. But trust me, there is no want of better books on the subject. Try the classics on Group Theory by Hall, Kurosh or Zassenhaus before you try this one."
2,Chambray Dress a disappointment,Maybe it is my interpretation of chambray that caused my disappointment in this product. The material was not soft and appeared that it would require ironing after each wash. The fit was excellent and appeared to be well made.
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This book was utterly disappointing. If you are at all interested in ""Alternative"" Medicine, then don't waste your time on this book. The author clearly is biased against alternative medicine - he warns people over and over again not to do certain alternative treatments instead of the ABC drugs available for MS. Those of us interested in alternative medicine don't need this kind of help. Our goal is to avoid those drugs and others that produce countless side effects and weaken our immune systems. I have a large collection of holistic-minded books, but this one went right in the trash!!"
2,Alternative Medicine & MS,"It does discuss a variety of alternative treatments for MS, but pretty well dismisses them all as either 1) ineffective but harmless or 2) ineffective and dangerous."
5,Replacment Motor,"Was a replacement motor from a 13yr old coal stove, company got it out the door quick. As described works great."
3,Not much info that I was hoping for...,"Scant info about how to feed and care for does who are pregnant. What to feed and how much...Otherwise, an okay book."
1,"A little information, but mostly soft","This book provided me with a little information that I needed to know, but on the whole, was literary fluff. Luttman is sentimental and opinionated through out the book and has trouble stating facts. Even in a convincing way. For example, instead of saying that you 'cull' 'kill' or 'slaughter' an unneeded buck, she said that ""you should do away with them"". Avoid this book altogether, or borrow it from a local library, but if you need to buy one get Jerry Belanger's 'Storey's Guide to Raising Dairy Goats: Breeds, Care, Dairying'"
4,Very insightful,Very good info in this book. Learned alot. In the process of determining which goats we want to get. This helped alot.
3,Out of Date Information,"For the first time goat owner, there is some good basic information, but some information needs to be updated (you will notice that the last update to this book was quite a while ago). Two important pieces of information come to mind as a present day dairy goat owner. First, the importance of testing for CAE as well as looking for potential CL abcesses (a very contagious disease) is not mentioned and CAE is only touched on and CL not even mentioned. The second important bit of information is the importance of copper in a goat's diet as well as providing proper minerals with copper and even copper bolousing as ways to greatly improve a goat's health. In addition, bucks and wethers need to have their diets supplemented with Ammonium Chloride to avoid urinary calculi (stones) which could potentially kill a male goat. For a first time goat owner, the ABC's are touched upon, but there needs to be more up to date information added for sure."
5,terrific primer for beginning hobby farmers,"I got this book for my dad for the holidays and he had finished reading it three days later. A solid introduction to goat farming, it covers all the major bases and we will continue to refer to it in the year to come as we begin a hobby farm!"
3,A LOT of information but maybe not for everyone..,"There's sometimes something as too much information.This book is definitely not short on facts, history and other bits of information about the country. It provides a wealth of information about Korea in general.As far as a guide book goes though, I think it provides too many facts and bits and history and forgets that it's not a history book or a fact book but in fact, is a guide book which should highlight and review things for people that are going to that country for a visit.Also, while this is South Korea, you would think a good amount of space would be for Seoul since that's where you're likely to spend most of your time or at least a portion of the trip but the Seoul section is in fact, quite short.The book is an interesting read...definitely a good book. I don't quite think I'd consider it a guide book though.."
2,OUTDATED,"this guide must be useful like 20 years ago.Not? not really.Newerly developted and popularized travel places aren't listed in this book at all.Aside from its cheap price, this book is next to useless.Rather get some travel brochures from government and local municipalities, which updates yearly, if you can.Way better and many of them are for foree."
2,This Book Is Outdated and Sucks,"I read through this book and took so much notes until I realized during the actual travel that it's outdated. This book sucks for reading purposes as well. Extremely dull writing, made me want to change my travel plans...am I'm Korean!!!"
2,Don't buy this guide,"I've been all over the world and have used Frommer's, Fodor's, Footprints. Lonely Planet, Let's Go, etc.Unless you want the details of Korean history and hiking trails, I found this to be the worst guide that I've ever used. Half of the web sites are defunct, there are almost no hotels and restaurants and the maps are the worst.If you DO want historical information about a country that you're about to visit, then get the Insight Guide--at least they have great pictures!"
2,"Very Encyclopedic, not helpful for traveler","I just spent a week in Seoul and I purchased two books for the trip (based upon reviews and currentness) -- this book and the Lonely Planet guide. While the information in the book was interesting, in a city without consistent street names and addresses, this book wasn't helpful in GUIDING us around the city. I mainly used it for background info and to find out which subway stop was near a site. However quotes like, 'it's steps from the Yaksu station,' weren't helpful as many stations had five to eight exits and you could often go in either direction once you got off the train.For background, yes. As a guide, no. I would rely on the KNTO maps and info as they were much more helpful."
2,too much literature,"Not good for quick referencing when on the road. Not the sort of lengthy literature that one has time to read when they are looking for a good hostel and nearest transport points en-route to some far out place. The history and cultural information was good to read on long trips but I prefer to do my cultural learnings first-hand.It did not detail some of the more essential points on disaparate and isolated locations. I found some of the views on modern cities like Seoul to be somewhat dated and missed the point slightly. Overall, it gave the impression of korea as some country stuck in medieval times with only monasteries and mountains for people to marvel at."
1,Terrible smell kept my cat away,I have no idea if this stuff works because my cat wouldn't go near any of his food that was mixed with it. It has a terrible smell which I think turned my cat away. It's too bad they don't make it smell like fish or something that cats would like. I was disappointed that I wasted $22.00.
3,Not sure this works,"This must smell awful because my picky girl turns her one right up to it! It's hard to tell if it works becausenshencant get past the smell,or taste!"
2,I remember the first really well,"the 2nd had its moments, nothing to writ home about but the first brought back memories when i was 12 year younger, my niece an nephew liked both of them iliked the first most of all"
5,What an eye opener,"One of the first things a Catholic learns is that the Eucharist is 'source and summit of the Christian faith'. Thanks to this book, I am beginning to understand why the Church says this so emphatically.This is not an easy book. It is written by a scholar, and for scholars, of high calibre (our Holy Father, Benedict XVI, won the same award for theological scholarship as the author of this book. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the insights I have been able to glean about the awesome majesty of the Mass."
5,Fun,The husband and I enjoy playing this game when the kids are gone for the evening. Only problem is it is highly addictive.
3,Interesting...,"This was interesting but it's mostly disappointing. I really enjoyed the game play and liked that it had more involvement than a regular SIMS type game making you meet requirements and all BUT it is rated mature for sexual content but doesn't show anything. There is sex...but the characters wear underwear the entire time. You only see breasts and I don't see why that makes it a mature rating.My Heff got to do interesting things like host partys, hire and fire staff, have sex on the pinball machine, etc.This was a good buy and keeps me entertained."
2,When dose the fun actually begin,"Okay iam not a perverted person but i decided to play this game. When you have s$$ all the clothe's don't come off, you walk around finding women to flirt with then her heart pump's up then that's your time to do it. This game is like the sim's but with half nudity and s$$. The women give's you a lap dance but it's just plain stupid. This game was not really fun to me it gotten boaring."
1,Cool But boring,Who doesnt like playboy? but this game sucks because there are too many glitches and it messes up all the time and crashes your ps2 so you have to turn it off and on. Its like a sim game that looks better but plays worse.
5,Good DVD for Scooby Doo fans,Both of my kids love Scooby Doo. They have watched this one several times since we got it. What better compliment can I give it than that?
3,M.Antrim,"The shipping time was acceptable. But the product itself, a VHS cassette had very poor quality of picture. They probably were not aware of this."
1,wrong DVD in package,when we received this it was keep for a Christmas present and when open the DVD was a wookstock disk not what should of been in it. Big surprised and grandchild very disappointed.
1,dj terry todd,"this cd failed to deliver as far as i am concerned, it lacked subtance, you know not enough funky jazzy soulful, hard knocking sound that house music was created from."
1,Had to stop reading it......,"I was enjoying this book and made it all the way to page 31. As a baby boomer I loved the reference to Ellie's mother's Villager sweater.And then, on page 31, there it was. Usually authors wait a bit longer. Yes, it was the obligatory insult to conservatives. I am really get sick and tired of every ""chic lit"" writer feeling the need to stick insults of Republicans and conservatives in their books. Newflash to writers: some of the people who buy and read your books may happen to be conservatives and/or Republicans. You are limiting your book sales by this practice. If this review makes just one author or budding author think twice about what they write then it will have served its purpose."
2,Not so great.,"I was looking for a couple good Halloween books for the kids. This wasn't a good choice. Stories are dumb, illustrations are sub par. ""And Then Comes Halloween"" was better."
2,Not fabulous,I bought this product after hearing the author be compared to Shel Silverstein. I felt the stories in this book are not appropriate for young children - and have decided not to continue to read it to my 3 year old. Not really worth it!
5,The best photo-art book ever. Period.,"Okay, so this book contains pictures of girls under 18 in the nude. Try to look at the bigger picture. That would be all that is beautiful in our world, and David hamilton has tried to fit as much as he can in one place. Many before him have tried, none have succeeded as he has. the pictures of countrysides, seascapes and Italian villas all join together with the aforemetioned images to create a perfect symmetry of beauty. This book is well worth its price, and then some."
4,New baby in the family!,"My great-grandson loves Clifford, and this video is great for him as he has a new baby sister. He watches the whole movie. It holds his interest, and could learn a little about having a new baby around."
5,Thoroughly Engaging,My granddaughter enoys watching each and every adventure on this video. Will it prepare her for the arrival of her little brother? Stay Tuned.
2,Backpack Literature :(,"This book was in EXTREMELY poor condition. The description provided said ""wrinkled cover"". So I really got took. I will not be able to sell this book for nearly as much as I paid for it. On the whole, I was extremely disappointed."
1,backpack review,This book took eighteen days to get to me and it was not in good condition i was not very please with my purchase
3,the book is destroy but...,paying 33cents for a college book that i will only be use one semester it is so freaking worth it.
3,Book condition,The book is in acceptable condition only not in good condition as advertised. The cover is damaged with some writing inside. Prompt shipping is appreciated.
2,a little misleading,"First off, it said the book would ship from within Kentucky, but it actually shipped from a different state, I think it was MI (showed on fedex tracking) but yet the sticker on return address still said Murry, KY. I bought the book because I am also in KY and thought it would ship faster, being in the same state. But it still took about a week. This book is also the ""examination copy"" but you wouldn't have known because there was a big sticker over those words. I took the sticker off because I did realize the cover looked different than other copies I had seen. There were several sticked that said USED BOOK on the cover, side and back, which I thought was downgraded the quality of the book. The stickers were very hard to come off and left alot of sticky residue. Although I do not know if the seller put them there, it could have been described better. I feel like I should have paid less for what I got."
2,"""Not For Resale""?","I got my book quickly, but as I looked at the side in big capital letters it said ""NOT FOR RESALE""If you are going to sell a book, they should take look at it"
1,a crude conservation plea to the converted,"I was terribly disappointed in this thin book. Its pages are doubled together to make it seem fat but it's a pathetically thin book. The best and only good photo is the one on the cover and its crude, sparsely 'written', clumsy plea for conservation is wasted because anyone who bought this book would likely already be a conservationist. Dont waste your money."
4,Big Bottle / Big Pill,"Country Life products have always been a favorite of ours, so we didn't hesitate to order their version of L-Lysine when we decided to add it to our daily supplements. The value was very good. The bottle is very big as it holds a lot of pills which are VERY large. If you have trouble swallowing pills, you might want to consider taking (2) 500 mg pills or a capsule instead. These are tablets and designed for a horse. Stay healthy everyone!"
5,Best + What could have been..,"I purchased this CD when it came out & was thrilled to listen to the new ""lost"" album as I showed that they matured in the lyrics & had a lot of potential again many years later. Sadly whith the death of Shirley it will be their swan song but thanks for the memories..."
1,XS is right: the mp3 click takes you to a different album,"XS is rightThe positive reviewers here are referring to the audio CDbut if you click the ""Download MP3"" button here you go to a completely different albumsomeone here at amazon has stuffed uptry it yourself"
2,"Feels rushed,too short,not enough detail,not a full story","Seems to go through almost thirty years in a flash,text and substance reads like a heavy metal magazine(not a complement).Too little spent during the time they were a musical force(1970-1978)and way too much on their dark years (1981-1996). All in all not bad but I expected better for a band as influential as Sabbath."
2,Black Sabbath: An Oral History (For the record),"It is a very short ""quote"" book, mostly consisting of statements from Bill Ward (The Drummer). Although interesting to read, the book lacked any other real veiwpoints from others that have been in the band. It would have been great to have a more balanced account from all the members of the band. Especially Ozzy osbourne & Tony Iommi. There are only a few quotes from these two, & lets face it, these guys are the ones who could have given us deeper insight into the wild ways of Black Sabbath in their Heyday! Overall, not bad."
5,lightofman,"absolutely striking. i have not heard anything more shameless, brilliant, and musically gorgeous. schematic is imaculate, their music is always far beyond tone and rhythm. there is a new faith here, a belief in humane respect of the antithesis, beauty in what is misunderstood. think of the music as it applies to you. there is comfort in this violence, the sexuality, the wounds."
1,English wasn't even their 5th language,"Ok, I'm sure this is a wonderful series like others have mentioned, but the atrocities in the English Subtitles were truly past laughable. I have enough other anime translations both good and bad that I was able to figure out what it was supposed to be, but I could barely get through episode one.And yes it is in the Tenchi universe but only through association that I have notice, so I recommend passing on it."
4,tenchi muyo gxp,"it's an almost typical boy meets girl and falls in love story, but add other women into the mix and you have a train wreck wating to happen. But not in this case, since our hero is the unluckiest person on the planet earth, he knows of tenchi and some of the women living with him. as we come to know tenchi is not just an earthling, but he's also a prince of the planet juri ( forgive spelling ) living on earth for most of his life. Wich brings us to our hero, seina is a friend of tenchi's his bad luck is so bad it affects people who he passes or gets close to him. untill a chance encouter with a GP officer who thinks he's a student of tenchi's recruits into the galaxy police. seina is in for two surprises near and at the end of this saga. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet."
1,Only because there is no zero,"Hey, I am a Tenchi fan. I loved the first Tenchi and also Tenchi Universe. However, when I received this one to watch, what a dissapointment. The idea of Tenchi had plot and great voice acting (in English. In Japanese, granted, Ayeka's voice is annoying.) I watched threw five episodes and turned it off. Let's talk about the characters. There is NB, a robot who apparently doesn't have the internet to get enough soft porn. Then Seina Yamada, the local idiot relative of Tenchi's who is jinxed. Then Mitoto Kuramitsu, spitting incarnation of Mihoshi, only more brain dead. And of course you have multiple women who want Seina. Yeah, yeah, been there, done that. As far as I'm concerned, Pioneer just milked me out of some cash and time. To bad, this could have been better, but I guess there intended audience was a bunch of 12 year-olds."
3,Hard to get started,"It was rough in the beginning to say the least. I wasn't fond of the character(badluck goof). However, the quality of animation and bringing the characters to life, were outstanding."
3,Drawback,"The box set is a good deal, all the episodes are correct, and all that good stuff. The one thing that bothers me is that iTunes won't recognize the disc as a DVD in the drive, though it will show up in the computer menu. If you have iTunes with an iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad and you would like to watch it, it flat out won't work. and vid conversion softwares will screw it up. so really the only way to watch it is through a computer disk drive or a standard DVD player. If you bought it so you could watch it on your Apple stuff, it was a waste of money, even if the box set was a good deal."
4,Anime review,I still can like this anime even though it's a side story of Tenchi. This is about an unlucky boy similar to Tenchi only he manages to get in the Galaxy Police due to his series of bad luck. It contained all the episodes that were in the series.
4,"Great show, BAD packaging",I love this show~The issue is that the case the the DvDs came in was cardboard and the Cover was totally scratched up. The DvDs though were unharmed but I decided to put them in my hard shell DvD case rather then keep them in their original box.
4,Very nice!,"Really nice listening music. Some of the songs want to make you get up off your seat and move, like a latin loves to move...."
3,Ok whats next,a lady with no memory must fight a war she's not ready for and her companions must lead and heal an army to defeat an old evil. will they win?cant wait to find out.
1,Less Than Stellar,"Although it is a serious effort at trying to be helpful, this book is disappointing in both content and presentation. The author presents only two accessories: a base plate and a work table top. Unfortunately, their construction is described in an appendix rather than before the description of the projects in which they are used. The projects themselves are of marginal utility. The book suffers from poor production values, the copious pictures being so poor in focus and contrast as to detract from their content. Although the author rightly emphasizes the safety issues inherent in the use of the Rotozip, none of the pictures show the use of appropriate fences or guards. This book does not fulfill the promise of its title."
2,Poor Quality,"Between one of my sons and I, we purchased three copies of this book. While the book describes many uses and techniques of the RotoZip tool, the quality of the photographs are terrible; all of the photographs are out of focus and almost useless. However, the text and line drawings are OK. The author does a good job of describing how to use the tool and includes several sample projects.I contacted the publisher, 1st Books Library, and they informed me that the books are printed in Canada on an ""on demand"" basis."
2,THIS (is bad),it fell apart when we got it home out kids cant learn cuz the numbers are like mircoscopic and the cards were like made out of paper so they ripped easyily this is a poor quality
5,Nothing better,"I may only be 15, but the image and sound of The Clash, have shocked me. This dvd pretty much portrays the image and is not what you would call a normal music dvd. It is more based on the interviews with Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Topper Headon and Paul Simonon and what happened in their own words.The clips of the band playing live narrow down the perspective of the punk era and all the stuff you woould expect the most influential punk band to do.I reccommend this album and if you don't buy it, there will be nothing that compares with it.PEACE OUT"
2,Too Much Talk - Too Little Music,"This film is built around recent interviews with the bandmembers. It is something of a history and deconstruction of the band in their own words. Unfortunately, most of the concert footage is sparse and the film maker cuts away frequently lest you really get into it. The interviews, which are such a big part of this film, were recorded low budget with one camera locked down with the same background throughout. Not much creativity there. If you are into a mellow evening of interesting interviews with occasional glimses of what was the Clash, then this is your film. If you thrive on the energy, style, artistry and attitude of the Clash performing, then I believe you will be disappointed."
5,Great little heater,"This is a great little heater. It's especially nice that you can connect the wiring from either the left or right side. I needed a 24 inch baseboard to replace my old one (which was pitted and rusty) and this was easy to install and works great. Plus, it was inexpensive. What more could you ask for?"
3,Bogus for an experienced world builder,"I've written many, many notebooks about my world. I ordered this and expected an inprovement in my world. But, it really didn't help(but the blank hexagonal maps are nice!) However, if your having problems making your world and don't want to use others, this is for you."
3,cast an animal kits,the animals once casted & painted are more for flat display the stand-up display & play. Mom did the casting part for 5 & 8 year olds then they painted. Horse legs seem to be thiner then rest of horse so when taken out of mold will probably break off. Still a great idea & kids will enjoy.
5,Bombay,"This song makes you feel like your there, at a Jazz bar called the Bombay enjoying great music just like this song. I have heard the whole song and have thoroughly enjoy listening to it. In fact I have the Borderline Breakdown CD and listen to it almost everytime I'm driving. This groups has a good listening sound. Good luck and much success."
5,Christianity in the Confederate Camp,"CHRIST IN THE CAMP or Religion in the Confederate ArmyThis book is not for the person who has a passing interest in religion in the Civil War or for the person who would like a ""readers-digest"" version condensation. It is in depth and detailed. It will introduce the reader to the names and places, revivals and prayer meetings, salvation preaching and the dedication of the officers. It was written a mere 22 years after the conclusion of The Civil War/The War of the Rebellion/The War of Northern Aggression. It is quite fascinating to see Jackson and Lee in this setting. It is written by J. William Jones, the chaplain of the Army of Northern Virginia so it is an up close and personal look. For the student of the Civil War interested in a deeper understanding this book is invaluable."
5,What a read!,"Takes you back to a time when God was clearly placed first in the lives of most Americans. Refreshing, insighful and inspiring throughout.Highly recommended!"
5,A good habit!,This is a really good book that explains how to stay in the habit of creating. To find your muse. And it gives examples of other routines that many artists in every media use to stay in the creative mood and do their best creating.
5,A real treasure,"Really loved this book. I not only found it inspiring on a macro level but on the micro level for an artist, it had those little things that allow you to get outside of your head and unblock. The one piece of advice i would give, is to digest it in no more than chapters (that may even be too large) and it will lead you out of your maze.I'm buying these as gifts to give to all my friends who call me at three am crying because they will never, write, paint, sculpt, act, dance etc, again.A guide from someone who has been in every maze you may encounter. I found it invaluable."
4,Challenging,"The basic premise of the book is that the process of creating means freeing one's mind by rituals that work. However, rituals are not imposed rules from an external source, but self imposed to support the creative end. She sjhows, that habits are the rituals that create the framework for creativity.I found this book to be challenging on a personal level. It has forced me to look at my rituals and ascertain if they are appropriate to achievement and supportive of my creative endeavors."
4,Just what I need but don't want to do.,"I am the person she describes - a very creative person needing but hating structure. I hope the book will help me buckle down. I've only read a little, and I am already getting on a more regular schedule."
5,"Great simple, practical guide for a more creative life.","This book is an easy read, and deceptively simple (especially the chapter titles) but there's a lot to it. As with any practical guide, you need to do some work to accomplish what you want (no, the book isn't going to do it for you, lazy American reader ...), but if you read through and THINK about what Ms. Tharp has to say, you'll see that her advice makes a lot of sense, and you can jump start past whatever barrier is holding you up from your own creative output. I am a creative myself, and find the book inspiring, but I've also recommended it to many friends with a variety of livelihoods, not all of them traditionally considered ""creative."" Creativity can be applied *anywhere,* and it's for *everyone.* You just have to learn how to tap your own creative reserve. This book can start you down that path."
3,It's okay,"The message is good, but the delivery is pretty annoying. She talks about herself a lot and goes on and on about things I don't care to waste my time reading. I can usually read a book in about 2 days to a week, but it is tough to get through this one as it generally gives me a headache. I ordered this with Steal like an Artist, and though Steal like an Artist is short... I think it delivers the creative message a lot more effectively and pleasantly."
3,The Creative Habit,One of the better books I've had to read on strategies for success in a creative field. Tharp is easy to read and the book is structured in an intelligent way.
3,practical but not carefully edited,"Some good, no-nonsense advice, incorporating broad range of sources. Several of these sources, however, should have been checked before publication. For example, she gets the quotation by E. M. Forster on the difference between plot and story backwards. Also, she doesn't bother to verify the old urban legend about the tycoon (variously identified as Henry Ford, JC Penney, or Thomas Edison) who wouldn't hire a prospective employee because he salted the food before he tasted it (see Snopes.com for background on story). These may seem like minor points, but perfectionists such as Tharp shouldn't be sloppy with the details."
3,Not ground shaking but still applicable,"I came to this book via a graduate level class. Over half way through it now I have yet to find it so insightful as to say ""I've never thought of that before"" but Ms. Tharp's various associations to dance and her deep and rich experiences do provide a useful expression. I will keep the book around for a while anyway as I feel confidently that it will help the undergrad age group that I teach."
2,Not for me,I read this as part of my summer reading and thought I could finish it in a week because I am a fast reader. However this book took my over three weeks to finish and it was a struggle. This book was not a light read in my mind and was not interesting enough to keep me going for long periods of time.
4,Hawaii and Menehune,"for Changeling: the Dreaming. The 2nd in the Immortal Eyes trilogy (preceded by The Toybox, followed by Court of All Kings), Shadows on the Hill covers the chimerical Hawaii setting, and includes the story material for the second part of the Immortal Eyes chronicle. it also introduces the Menehune, the islands' native fae.the biggest problem with this book is that it spends too many pages detailing characters, pages that could have been better spent giving more detail to the various Menehune Callings (the four divisions of the Hawaiian fae) and their culture. the focus of the book is on the European Kith, and treats the native fae as a sidenote.the setting material is good, and open-ended enough to set Chronicles in Hawaii entirely for many years, though a good bibliography would have help fill in the holes."
3,"Okay, but dated","A bit of a disappointment. I am a big fan having seen Hopkins live w/ Quicksilver & also Jefferson Airplane. A great session man who has played w/ about everybody . Tin Man is ok , but doesn't take us anywhere new or inspiring."
4,"Classic album, good sound quality",I have been looking for this on CD for some time & was surprised to find it at Amazon. This is Nicky's best solo recording as a whole with a great cast of 'guest' musicians including George Harrison. The sound quality is pretty good considering we have no idea if these are from the 'master' Stereo 2 track tape mixes. Love the cover art with the fingers as piano keys. A must for your Beatle collection. Had the pleasure to meet Nicky (and his dad & sis) when he was touring with the Jeff Beck Group at the Electric Factory in Philly 1968. Long live the music Nicky Hopkins!
2,The best of an era,"Nobody added more to more rock and roll albums than Nicky Hopkins. He was a full member of The Jeff Beck Group (along with Ron Wood and Rod Stewart), Quicksilver Messenger Service and The Jerry Garcia Band. As a sideman, he moved the sound to another level for Jefferson Airplane, Steve Miller, Matthew Sweet, the Beatles and (listen to ""Angie"") the Rolling Stones' very best work.Here, he shows off his instrumental skills but the writing and singing are painful."
2,Got mine at the 99 cents store,These are not the best; they will get some blackheads out and that's pretty much it. Please be warned: These were available at my local 99 cents store along with other Nu-Pore brand products. DON'T waste your money getting them from Amazon!
1,check to the postal price,"Just noticed the 14.95 postal fee for the 3 I was about to buy. 4.99 for each item purchased, still to high. Some things are to good to be true."
2,ok,not too many to start with. cannot make much out of it even with the combination of the other purchase. would not purchase more. should of bought the poetry package as those have more to work with.
1,Cut in the middle of the word,I wanted these magnets to help with my Kindergartener's sight words and learning. They're cut in the middle of the words and many of them are completely useless. Don't waste your money.
5,Something Very Special,"Kevin Mahogany is a brand new find for me. Saw him on Public TV at the Newport Jazz Festival and decided to pick up My Romance. Mahogany is super smooth on this one. Performs numbers made famous by others and tops them - adds a couple I've never heard before but now love. This guy has got it all, superb vocal quality, a romantic smoothness that makes a girl's knees grow weak and that unique very, very special quality that makes someone a star. I prefer Mahogany even to the great Joe Williams. Once you have My Romance you will definitely want to have others."
5,A Total Jazz Vocal Experience,This is one of his best releases. The CD creates a complete mood and transforms you. You are drawn into this musical world for an experience you will want again and again.Kevin Mahogany's voice totally embraces the music giving true meaning and sincerity to each line. The deepness and richness of his voice continues to make him one of my favorite jazz vocalists.My Romance is more than mood music. He melds true jazz styling with a richness and class.
5,This is a hurricane Katrina news special,"This film does not really address overall preparedness in the United States. It is a chronicle of the Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath, using interviews and news clips. It was interesting but the focus is very specific to New Orleans."
5,Justin Timberlake Rocks!,"This is a great book. It has a ton of great pictures and everypage explains about Justin and it doesnt have any useless stuff that nobody really cares about in it either! Another great thing about this book is that if you dont have enough time to read the whole page word for word it summarizes each page with little bubbles that tell some key facts about every page. This book is so cool! It summarizes everything you could ever want to know about Justin Timberlake. One of the coolest things about this book is that it has 6 pages deicated to awesome facts all about him; from his favorite store to his new car, it tells everything! Now, to summarize the entire book I should just tell you that ""Just Justin"" is an awesome book and it cover the entire life of Justin Timberlake! You should really consider this book to either purchase or at least read. It is great for people like me who are in love with Justin Timberlake."
5,excellent,"excellent knife for the kitchen collection used for boning turkey, chicken and duck if you like to make turducken as we did good product!"
2,only used to check,I purchased this new pump and decided to save it for next summer. I did test it out and found it to have plenty of power. My filter also seemed to work. I hope next summer these will do a great job as others have stated.
2,meh,Its basically a girls anime. I bought it and i just thought it was too happy and light hearted. No action really. If your a guy you won't like it. Girls would enjoy this though. I sold it right back on amazon.
4,"PUT IN CASE YOU DIDN""T ON DVD!","this is a great live dvd, I would have preffered less Filth pig tracks but it was shot well and the sound is great. the dvd has stigmata and so what which the cd doesn't so buy the dvd"
2,A basic biography,"Just bought the book and was disappointed in the lack of depth. Anderson did a lot of study on the background and setting of the Gospel story, which is good and helpful, but don't expect anything startling or new. It lacks scholarly depth and profundity. The teachings of Jesus are conspicuously absent in this biography. For instance, the Lord's prayer is covered in all of two pages. It is a great book for someone unfamiliar with Jesus' story, however and tells it in contemporary and understandable language."
2,Beautiful - but not for someone with pets,"I loved the smokey grey color, and the protection-without-intrusiveness that this cover had to offer. Unfortunately, what I discovered within just a few days of owning it is that the rubber material is a magnet for every speck of dust, fuzz and pet hair within a 2 mile radius. I was so disappointed, because the cover looked very slick. If you don't have any pets, this might still be a great buy for you, tho it did seem to pick up dust almost as quickly as dog hair. I will be switching to a hard cover for my Axim - not what I wanted to do, but it seems like my choice is either to have a gorgeous cover that looks positively filthy and gross, or a bulkier hard cover that stays clean."
4,Great Effort,This is a prime example of how someone with a very limited budget can create something which is :a) Suspensful and horrificb) Not amateurish and painful to sit through.A very taut and worthwhile little movie.
4,A Worthwhile Purchase,"A good storyline, A fairly good budgeted film. I do not believe there are any sex scenes in this film but there is nudity and a good storyline that goes with it and the story is believable and it might actually be based on a true story. I paid $15 for it and I believe it is worth that much."
2,I was in it as an extra....,"LOL I was in this film as an extra. I had to buy it or else I would be very upset. This one was a hoot, and I enjoyed being a part of it."
4,A bravura performance by Danielle DeLuca...,"Other reviewers have pretty well described the good and bad of this flick, which is evidently based on a real serial killer who enjoyed hunting and killing young women he captured and released into the wilderness. What could have been a routine B-movie is elevated a notch by the amazing performance of Danielle DeLuca as one victim who decides to fight back. DeLuca must spend a great deal of the movie trekking naked over rough terrain. Her character experiences a progression of emotions--terror, frustration, panic, determination and finally anger--and Danielle pulls it off very well (no pun intended). I could have done without the tacked-on ending, but some may find it satisfying. Regardless, if you check this one out, I guarantee you'll never be the same again."
3,I suppose it COULD be a coincidence...,"This movie appears to be eerily similar to the case of Robert Hansen, a serial killer in Alaska. Hansen would abduct strippers from nearby towns, take them out in his plane, land in the middle of nowhere and then give them a running head start, hunting and shooting them to death like animals. He is believed to have killed 7 women. One survivor, after much skepticism on the part of police, led them to Hansen.Hansen committed his crimes when his wife and kids were away on vacations. He was a real sicko.He was convicted in 1984 and sentenced to 461 years plus life. He is currently serving his sentence at the Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward."
4,Fun Popcorn Movie!,"The first time I watched this was with a bunch of friends and it was totally fun! The title makes it sound like a T&A; movie but we were happliy surprised by the story, acting and everything. It may be a low budget flick but it's really well done.Bottom line, if you're looking for a good chase movie with some fun scares this is a good one to have."
1,NAKED FEAR - WASTE OF TIME,ONLY READ THIS REVIEW! This movie was awful because of the plot and the bad acting. I CANT BELIEVE PEOPLE GAVE THIS MOVIE 5 STARS!
2,poor quality,"Globe and base did not fit together, overall just a waste of $ - have had better luck with Global Shakeup snowglobe kits."
2,Snow Globe,"Extremely small, and not at all what I expected. Not even sure what you could do with them that would make any sense."
5,displeased with size representation in product details,"Because I needed a specific size, for the object I wanted to place within the globe, I was forced to guess how big the neck opening was; it proved to be too small; a refund of the purchase price was provided; however I had to pay a $9 shipping fee, which was unrefunded."
5,"KIDS LOVE IT, MOM & DAD LOVES IT TOO!","This CD quickly became our children's favorite after just one listen. We can't go anywhere without them wanting it on in the car. When we're at home, they watch the video which is amazing.The songs are done in all different styles, the kids love them all. The singers aren't the typical irritating kids cartoon voices that you'd expect to hear on a children's CD, instead this is more like a Disney quality with great musicians and singers. Crystal Lewis is exceptional on the ""Beach Party Movie"" song, but we like all the songs equally. We can't stop singing them. My husband even likes it!!! The real fun thing about this CD is that the songs are done in a variety of styles and done in such a fun way!"
1,There is NO symphony!!!,"The worst!!! The dolphins make either NO sounds at all, or a BARELY audible whistle when you tap them as instructed. Plus, tapping or touching them at all makes the innertubes come unhooked from each other. If you just want colorful dolphins resting on innertubes, this toy is fine. But then it should be called that, and not ""Water Symphony."" A huge disappointment!!"
2,A fun toy if you don't expect music!,"As countless others said, they don't play music well and they surely don't stay together at all. To get mine to whistle, I have to bang really hard on them.That said, my toddler has no idea they are supposed to make music, so she thinks they are fun.Over all, not worth the money."
1,doesn't deliver,"I gave this bath toy 1 star because it doesn't do what it promises. You hit the dolphins on the head and a whistling noise comes out. After the first 3 times we used it, the dolphins never made a noise again because they flood with water too quickly. My daughter loves the colorful dolphins but the person who gave this to us spent their hard earned money on it thinking it was as great as it claims to be and really it's a scam. Also the musical sheets are paper? Hello, how about plastic since this is a BATH toy! If you want great bath toys, buy those wind-up ones that swim in the tub, they are fun for everyone!"
1,Don't buy it!!,"This toy ended up in the trash. Does NOT make the ""musical notes"" that it promises...the links will NOT stay together. Takes up too much storage space. Skip it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I thought this toy looked adorable for my 14-month old. Well, the Dolphins hardly make any ""musical note"" if that's what you want to call the noise they make. There are a lot of pieces and they don't stay together. Looks can be deceiving."
2,broken up about this toy.,I bought this toy For my son when he turned one and he did not understand it so I put it away until now which he is 18 months old. This toy is not fun because the circle parts that are supposed to say together and float do not stay together and they fall apart. My son gets frustrated with it and just starts to plunge the dolphines in the water to hear the toot sounds and then throws it out of the tub. The only education i found is that it helped with his motor skills because he practiced puting them together but again he would end up throwing them out of the bath tub. This toy is not worth the money that you paid for it.
2,Misses The Principle,"In theory a great toy! In reality it falls apart once you actually use it. The dolphins attach by pegs and rings and they are sequenced in a scale in the shape of a circle. The pegs are too short to stay attached to the rings. When you tap the water whistle dolphins on the head, the circle of notes is broken. It's fun for baby to chase them around the tub, however, they topple over. You can't play the songs with or for your baby because the notes are all over the tub. Makes bath time chaotic and frustrating. Not worth the money but definitely worth a revision."
1,A huge letdown for whole family,"What a waste of money. Cute, I'll give them that, but useful? Only in taking up space in the tub basket. The first thing my 3 year old daughter said when we first TRIED to use them was, ""Mama? How come they don't sing?"" I think I've lost the feeling in my fingertips trying to make the buggers make anything but a plastic thugging sound. From time to time, when the tide is high and the moon is low, my daughter can get something that may qualify as a musical note out of them. But all in all? A huge letdown for the whole family. I was so excited to have the kids have music during bathtime...guess i'll keep searching. Or take up singing?? Hope not!"
1,Not worth the money,We bought this for my daughter and it was a big disappointment. The rings do not stay together. Only the higher pitched dolphins make noise. They are cheaply made and I would never recommend them to anyone.
3,If you want something that will float around in the tub this is great,I had seen this available in so many places I thought this would be a great tub toy. It is as long as you are just looking for something to float around the tub in many pieces. It is super hard to get these things to even make a sound. In the end my 2 year old likes to drown them and they have held up.
1,Don't waste your money,"As mentioned in other reviews, the biggest problems with this toy are that the dolphins do not actually play any notes and it is very tough to link the animals together. In order to get the dolphins to make the slightest squeak of a noise, you have tio slap them pretty hard and then, you can't really hear the squeak over the sound of your hand slapping the toy. I would not recommend wasting your money on this toy."
1,Don't even bother,I actually found these at home goods for [...]...well I am glad I did not pay more than [...]... First off the colors of the dolphins were all messed up..they didn't match their tubes...When I mean they didn't match...they put in whacky colors like red/orange colored dolphin but a yellow tube (no yellow dolphin) then we got two of the same colored dolphins. Okay..so the colors weren't a huge deal I suppose but then the dolphins wouldn't whistle...that's totally useless...and as someone else mentioned the links don't stay linked. HUGE disappointment!
4,We like them!,I have read alot of the other negative reviews but my daughter loves these! We actually bought a set for her friend also. My daughter loves to match up the dolphins with the correct color ring and loves playing in the tub with them. She can make the music better than I can. I think most kids would enjoy them -the facial expressions are great and the colors are vibrant. My only complaint is a small one -that some of the rings are a little different colored then the dolphins so my daughter had a little trouble matching them up.
1,Don't waste your money.,"If your just looking for something to float in the tub, then these dolphins will do it. But if you're actually thinking that you can get some musical value out of them, forget it."
1,Don't waste your money.,"If you want a bunch of useless plastic junk to float in the tub then this is the toy for you.The dolphins are supposed to play a note when you tap them on the head. They really don't. The sounds, when actually there, are barely audible whistley whispers...certainly not distinct enough to tell apart from one another. Once the toys are filled with water they make no noise at all.Another annoyance is the lack of matching colors. The dolphins and the rings are not the same...so even if you get the numbered rings in order, you can't easily put the dolphins where they're supposed to be in the ""scale.""Over all, a complete waste of money."
2,"Disappointment, but you get what you pay for","I was excited about the idea of a little toy for my 19-month old that made music in the tub. From the description of the toy, you'd think that's what this was. First of all, tapping the dolphins on the head makes either a ridiculous whistling noise that can barely be called a note, if it works at all. Most of the time, they don't really work at all. And, as stated in other reviews, the ring does NOT stay together in the tub, making it hard to keep track of them and play any kind of ""song"" whatsoever. That being said, it's a cute toy if you're just looking for a brightly colored, floating tub toy, and for that purpose, my daughter likes it. Just don't expect it to be much else."
3,Isn't too bad...,"Well, we put this on our registry-- mostly because of the bright colors (and I happened to think it looks cute!) My son is 7 months old, and I just took it out for him to play with during a bath. My husband & I both took turns testing it out...what we found is that it isn't very loud (when you tap their heads) but it is loud enough to hear...you kind of have to tap it hard enough, though... the only thing that kind of bothered me while we were testing was that when we would tap them on the head, they kept unhooking in the bath tub... I'm sure any moms who have tried this know what I mean. They just wouldn't stay in their link, looped together. But, either way, I still like it...I would probably buy it again, just for the colors and the water play for my son. It is pretty cute to look at."
3,"Cute and amusing, but not as a musical toy","I bought this used at a baby tag sale, so keep that in mind when reading my review. The dolphins are much bigger than it seems in the picture, each ring is 4"" or so across. The dolphins fascinate my daughter (1 year) and she does enjoy the toy, but they barely make any noise (keep in mind it is used) and the rings will not stay attached to one another. Instead we just have the 8 dolphins floating around the tub. I think its well worth the $2 I paid, but I would not pay the retail price on this toy!"
1,Not Worth It.,"I was also happy when receiving this as a gift. However, it takes up too much room and they don't stay connected. If you have to use your tub for other than your child for bathtime, then it's fine. If others need it to shower, it's lots of bulky pieces to find places for when not in use. Get a BIG bucket or something. It's just more trouble than worth."
2,"Wanted to Like it, But...","I was excited when my daughter received this for her first birthday. But it just doesn't work the way it should. The ring, when strung together, takes up a lot of room in the tub. The dolphins don't stay connected at all. Only a few of the dolphins actually whistle the right pitch when you tap them. Some of them you have to tap very hard to get any sound...and my daughter's still a baby. She's not going to understand how to make it work. At this point the dolphins and innertubes are just stuffed in the toybox, and we've gone back to rubber ducks and the like. I didn't hate this toy, but I wouldn't recommend it, either."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Unfortunately, this toy isn't as fun as it looks! It's a lot of work to put it all together every single time your baby takes a bath, it takes up a lot of room and falls apart pretty easily. Additionally, it doesn't make ""music"", rather it just whistles a little...if you're lucky!! Sorry...thumbs down for me."
2,Cute but does not work,"This is such a cute toy we were really hoping it would be a lot of fun but it was not to be.Things that we found to be wrong:1. Instructions are nill to none.2. Some dolphins you have to press really hard to get a noise others you have to tap very very very very lightly or they make no noise at all.3. The color coding is weird.4. The ""rafts"" that keep the dolphins floating are worthless. They are just too hard to get to link and then they come apart way to easily.I gave it two stars instead of one as my son does like to play with the dolphins.The product does NOT work as it says it is intended to."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"MY DAUGHTER LOVES BEING IN THE BATH TUB, SO I SET OUT TO BUY HER INTERESTING AND EDUCATIONAL TOYS. BROUGHT HOME THE SYMPHONY FOR CHRISTMAS, WAS VERY EXCITED.SET IT ALL UP, PUT HER IN THE TUB. WELL WE PUSHED IT, NO SOUNDS AND IT KEPT COMING APART. YOU HAVE TO TOUCH IT GENTLY AND EVEN AT THAT THERE IS VERY LITTLE SOUND. PLUS HAVING TO CONSTANTLY PUT IT BACK TOGETHER EVERY TIME WE TOUCHED IT MADE BATH TIME LESS EXCITING.PLEASE DON'T BUY IT, EVEN AT $20 YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH AN EMPTY SHAMPOO BOTTLE TO PLAY WITH OR THE GOOD OLD RUBBER DUCKIE.MY DAUGHTER WAS 18 MTHS OLD WHEN I PURCHASED IT.GOOD LUCK"
2,"Well, it doesn't make music...","I was hoping this toy would work for both my 4 and a half and 9 month old. If you are buying this expecting it to make music, don't. The dolphins emit a sound once or twice at best. They are colorful and make for a good sorting toy. The hoops do not stay connected as shown in the picture. Again, they are good for other pretend games for my older child. The baby likes to bang the wall with rings since they are very easy to hold. I guess if you can piuck it up inexpensively it is worth it, but otherwise, don't buy it."
1,Poor toy,"Doesn't ""perform"" as stated. ""Blows"" as a toy. Takes on too much water and then fails to work. Son always asking me to fix. Now he just blows up the tail end to use as a whistle."
1,CERTAINLY NOT WORTH [the money],I was completely disappointed with this bath toy. I waited almost 1 1/2 years for this to go on sale and it finally did. I was so excited to give it to my daughter to make her bath time that much more fun. Music? What music. Plays tunes? What tunes. Lame Lame lame. Not even worth buying on sale.
4,"They're no Mozart, but. . .","my daughter got these when she was about 6 months old and honestly, they were a disaster in her baby tub - no sound, etc. Once she graduated to the big tub, they've been a big hit. I think the sound quality is linked to water depth. we have a HUGE tub so space isn't an issue and my daughter could care less if the dolphins are linked together or not. Virtually indestructible and a life saver for me now that my daughter would like to visit with me while I'm in the ""potty"" - she works tirelessly to balance the dolphins on their tails. A little pricey, but this was a gift from grandma, so I really can't complain about that."
2,whistling dolphins?,"his toy is extremely wobbly to be used in a bath, doesn't whistle half the time, doesn't hold well together, doesn't have any imaginative possibilities unless you take into consideration the out of tune notes it emits, and demands too much concentration at the end of the day."
1,Not worth the money.,"I thought this toy would be a great, reliable toy for the 20-25 dollars it sells for, but the reviews are all correct, doesn't play notes reliably, won't play them when there's water in the dolphins and they don't stay linked together. It's very frustrating for the kids :("
4,Whole family loved these,"Our kids, now 8, still like playing with this toy, which they've had for at least 5 years.I can't explain why so many people had trouble with it. We'd usually put two or three of them in the tub and the kids would whack them for the music, and use them as scoops to pour water over each other. The rings floated other dolls and toys. Many uses."
1,Save your money--buy something else.,"These are just terrible. They don't work well at all. We finally started blowing through them--clears out the water and you actually hear some sounds. I haven't tossed this yet only because it is holding up really well, but I should. They aren't fun, take up too much space, and don't work right at all. They do seem durable."
1,Very disappointed,"I was disappointed in that the various rings do not hook together well at all. Half of the dolphins do not make more than the slightest squeek. For the cost of the toy, it was a huge letdown. Don't bother with this one."
2,Not happy with this toy,"It takes up a lot of space, without being much fun.The rings break apart too easily, which frustrates the little kid. Plus, they don't whistle easily...also frustrating a little kid."
2,Disappointed!!,Sounded like a lot of fun in the toy's description. Very difficult to get the toy to make a sound and when it does not much. Don't waste your money!!
1,Not durable if I break it out of frustration....,"Biggest waste of cash. Looks like such a great toy, but I hate it. I may take someone else's review advice and teach colors with it, but it takes up way too much space. I'll hang onto it in the hopes that maybe as my 14 month old gets older, we can play nicer with it, but this is definitely not a baby toy and I'm suspecting it's a lousy toddler toy too. I am so glad my family didn't waste their money on this, it's bad enough my husband and I did! Should have read the reviews!!! We usually know better! More specifically.... The dolphins are tricky, some make sound some don't, the dolphins do not stay in the rings, the rings do not stay hooked together. My son likes to bang the rings around but could care less about the water-logged drowning dolphins."
2,Waste of money,"I bought this for my daughters (ages 18 mos & 7 mos at the time) for Christmas thinking they'd really enjoy a musical tub toy. Well, they're hardly ""musical"". If you tap on their heads, and the water has to be deep enough, they'll sort of play a note. Each fish has it's own note. They don't work at all in a bubble bath and my daughters never play with them to make music. They like filling them up with water and dumping the water out more than anything else. A couple of cups would have provided the same entertainment. I wouldn't spend the money again."
2,I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS,"I swear by the reviews on Amazon.com, but unfortunately I did not read them before purchasing. Our 4th son just turned 1, and celebrated his 2nd Christmas. I just bathed him and put the dolphins in with him....believe what you read. The rings do not stay together and the dolphins really don't sing!! If you tap the tops of the head, nothing happens; if you lift the dolphin out of the water and slightly ""smack"" the water with it, it will make a noise. Quite frankly it works better if you blow into the dolphin. The baby got a kick out of the toy for a short time. Maybe I'll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around. Also, this toy takes up lots of room!! I gave it 4 stars for durability since it does seem pretty sturdy."
2,Not a Good Toy for Little Ones - a review of the dolphins,"This toy is supposed to be for babies and toddlers and yet it doesn't have any of the features one would expect in a young child's toy.One would expect color, ease of use, softness, and purpose. The only qualification that the Water Symphony Tub matches is that the dolphins and the rings are colorful.Which brings me to the question of who on earth thought that making the rings so hard to connect was a good idea. As a mom, I usually have other chores at bath time other than ring rangler. And then there is the hardness factor. The dashboard of my car is softer. A little more built-in teething satisfaction would have been nice.Two stars. The dolphins do make noise but not often enough. They are hard enough that a baby can hurt their gums on them, or *you* or a sibling if they are thrown. One plus is that they don't seem to mildew."
1,Don't bother with this one!,"This sure was a disappointment! It looked like fun, but try as we might my kids and I could hardly get the dolphins to make any noise. We ended up throwing it out."
2,water symphony is a bore!,My 2 year old asked me to remove this lame toy from the tub after tapping the (nearly audible) tones of each dolphin's head for only a few minutes.Good luck getting the circles to link up on land -- let alone in the water! They separate and are very frustrating to set up.I was very disappointed in this toy.Mom in Ohio
2,Garbage,"This looks cute, and it is advertised in many mail order catalogues. However, the sounds don't work reliably, and it is impossible to keep the pieces together. Forget it."
1,Nearly Worthless,"It's hard to imagine how a toy like this remains on the market. I won't go into detail here because I'd just be echoing the many complaints that have already been written. I'm just stunned that such a completely dreadful, useless waste of money continues to sell."
2,at least it's colorful,"The description sounds great but the actual toy doesn't deliver. The rings don't stay together unless the water is still. When the dolphins tip over, which is nearly all the time, they fill with water and the sound mechanism becomes clogged. They have to dry out before working properly again. We still play with them all the time (children ages 1 and 3) but only because they are colorful and float-y."
3,Mediocre at best,"My kids (3.5 and 2) received this as a gift, and at first I was excited--it's cute and colorful. In theory, a great toy. However, my kids don't like it. Water gets inside the dolphins and when this happens, they won't make noises (easily remedied by shaking the water out of them, but my kids don't have the patience for this). They also get very frustrated that the rings that the dolphins sit in do NOT stay linked together. Slight movements that disturb the water will cause the chain to come apart. I'm sure that this would be a favorite bath toy with a few improvements made by the company."
1,Can't Carry A Tune,"While I wasn't expecting Mozart, Water Symphony just couldn't carry a tune in our tub. The tones were way too low --the sound of the plastic dolphins hitting against the plastic ring was most often louder than their ""singing"" And, with two kids in the tub, this toy took up TOO much room. Water Symphony had two performances before bad reviews from my kids closed it for good at our home."
2,"Cute for parents, not kids","We received this as a gift. While the concept is great, it's not a reality for our 22-month-old. His favorite part is whacking them with other toys to knock them over. Half the time the dolphins don't make the musical notes when you bop them. And the linking system (so they stay in a circle) is hard to keep together. Also, they fill with water, and our son likes to pick them up and throw them out of the tub, soaking whatever it lands on. Maybe when he's older, but I really don't recommend it."
1,"A good idea, not well put together","We expect our purchases to be worthwhile, and we expect our toys to be a good value. This one is a great idea, but it's poorly designed, and so it's not a good value at all. The rings do not stay together in the water, so the dolphins float about aimlessly in the water. Very frustrating for our little ones. They have decided they have no use for this toy. so sorry to say that this mom believes this purchase has been a waste of money."
4,My son loves these guys,"Ok, so, they don't make much music and they don't stay together. They still offer fun in the tub - my little one is learning his colors and loves to have these dolphins jump up and out of the water - yelling the color as they go flying across the tub. They don't trap mold or mildew - they've actually been quite fun for him."
1,Waste of space,"This toy takes up a ton of space and DOESN'T WORK!!! Rings DO NOT link together, they fall apart if the kids move at all which kids tend to do in tubs and they DO NOT make music. I managed to get a few of the dolphins to make tiny squeaks that you could barely hear with the kids moving around. I'm going to try and return it."
2,"Yeah, all the reviews are right","My daughter got this for her second birthday. I had been eyeing it for awhile, and was happy to receive this gift because she is very interested in music. This toy is supposed to play a musical scale, there are 8 dolphins and each one based on the color is supposed to sing one of eight notes. When we hooked the thing together, the rings completely unhooked from one another and when you tap the dolphins on the head (when they are in water) they only sing one of two tones. I envisioned playing the dolphins like they were a xylophone, maybe playing a song with them, but there is no way, there are only two notes and 4 of the dolphins play one, and 4 play the other. The way they represent themselves really is ludicrous (""Play a symphony in your bathtub."" Yeah, right!).That said, my daughter does put one or two in her bath, spills water in their bellies, flips them over and pours the water out. There is no difference between these and much cheaper bath toys."
1,Poorly made and little fun,"This toy was poorly made, didn't hold together well in the tub and it was almost impossible to may the musical notes. The seller was not very helpful about return/refund. I won't buy from Amazon ""partner"" sellers in the future - more like a flea market than a retailer."
2,a dissappointment,"didn't stay linked in a ring, difficult to keep the appropriate amt of water in them to make them whistle. We tossed them."
1,Not what I thought,"This toy plays music by forcing air through the dolphin when it is tapped. I thought this was battery opererated and that the music was going to be strong and clear, but it is not. The sound that is released, if at all, is almost inaudible. This is still a fun tub toy. My girls aged 2 and 4 years still like to match the colors and make them swim. It is not however, very musical or educational. I would have returned it if I had paid more than $11.99 for it."
1,Don't bother!,"The pieces don't stay together, the dolphins barely make any noise. My 3 year old is not at all interested in these, if anything, they just frustrate her."
1,not worth the money,"I ordered these for my 2 year old daughter thinking they would be fun during the bathtime. They are not what I expected. They work on the same principle as the musical wine glasses. They are hollow on the inside and make a sound based on how far up the water comes in the hollow inside. The idea is a good one and is nice that there are few parts and no batteries needed. However, the dolphins don't work half the time and don't work if water is in the wrong areas. They fall over easily and don't make enough noise to actually play any musical tune. My daughter has more fun putting them in the floaties and blowing out the blow holes to clear to the water to try to get them to sing. I would not have bought them if I had seen and tried them out before hand."
1,Very Disappointed!,These dolphins are a terrible bath toy for kids. You have to hit the dolphin very hard on the top of the head to get the sound to work. My children couldn't do it and the dolphins did not link together as I thought they did. I donated this toy right after purchasing it...too bad..what a waste of money.
1,NOT recommended,"I think this product misrepresents itself. The dolphins do make noise, but I would hardly call it singing. If you tap them, if you're lucky you hear a slight ""bing"", but some of them are completely silent. The rings do not stay together at all and there is no symphony going on in this tub. It's cute, but takes up room, and not with the money. A plastic duck for $.99 is as much fun."
2,disappointing,"I would definitely not call this a water symphony....they barely make a sound when you tap them in the water. They are cute, but pointless. My 1 year old son showed no interest in them."
4,I liked it,"I bought this toy before I had ever looked it up online and was extremely nervous to keep it considering the reviews, but I love it. My daughter thinks the dolphins are great and is learning her colors and playing music. I had no trouble getting the dolphins to sound, the trick is not to fully submerge them. I will admit it doesn't connect well, but all in all I love it!!"
2,Does not stay together,This toy barely makes music. It does not stay in the circle as the pieces come apart every time my kids try to play the music. They like the dolphins and do play with them but as far as actually making music the toy is terrible. It is cute but not worth the cost.
1,"Lousy music, boring toy","I really thought this was a cute idea, but as another reviewer noted, you have to hit the dolphins ""just right"" to get the tone, and even then it is not very loud. They don't stay hooked together well, they are bulky and take up lots of space. I got these when my son was 18 months old and he quickly got bored with them and has never had much interest in playing with them. I think it was a total waste of money."
1,It's not a musical toy. These are just hard dolphins.,"We found that only a child 5 or older can gently and swiftly rap on the dolphin's head to make a note. Younger children always push the dolphin down too far, too slowly to get any sound. After one dip in the water the dolphin is no longer musical, unless mom or dad shakes the water out!The connecting rings are frustrating - overall I grew tired of picking up so many pieces of a toy that was nothing more than a few shapes to play with in the water."
1,Not Worth It,"My son recieved this toy as a birthday present. Looking at the box, it seemed like a really cute toy that played music in the bathtub. However, when we tried it out, it was not what we expected. You have to push on the dolphin's body rather hard to get it to play a ""note,"" and the rings detach from each other quite easily. My son was more interested in the other toys in the tub, and basically ignored this toy all together."
1,Don't waste your money,"What a disappointment! The sound is very soft, water must be calm, and you must be gentle pushing dolphin down.Only thing we've been able to use them for is teaching our 2 year old his colors while bathing."
3,Doesn't really work as expected but it is cute and fun,"You can't really make a ring with the dolphins. And the dolphins won't whistle if there is water in them. But you if you blow the water out by blowing up through the base you can get it to whistle - which my daughter loves. If you weren't in a bath with a two year old you could probably play tunes as well but they don't really stay dry that long in practice.But they are cute, good for learning colors, nearly indestructable (which surprised me) and fun to play with!"
2,frustrating,I couldn't get it to stay together or play music.my daughter got frustrated w/ so many things in the tub.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for my little girls's first birthday. I should have read the other reviews before buying. I only paid ten dollars and thank goodness for that. Like the other reviewers have said, this product falls apart easily and it is difficult, at best, to get it to play music. Good news is i learned an important lesson....Always read reviews first."
1,water symphony,Bad toy. Rings do not stay together. Ducks are always getting water inside and will not make sounds. Don't recommend. My 3 yr. old gets very frustrated.
2,Son Loves It - Don't know why,"I bought this toy because I thought it was cute, As the other reviewers have said the dolphins & their corresponding tubes do not match, not even close. They whistle when you push them down in the water, but you have to do it quickly to even make a peep and the sound isn't even that loud. My son likes to connect the chains and put the dolphins in each tube. My son (2 years old) also likes to stack all the tubes on his arm like bracelets, it amuses him, and he doesn't necessarily care about the matching colors which is why I've given it two stars. Essentially your child will play with this toy in their own way, not necessarily as advertised or intended by the maker."
2,Throwing money down the drain,"My boys received this as a gift, and at first I thought this was great. A non-splashing, fun, colorful and interactive bath toy. But it's not what it should be. Water gets inside the dolphins and when this happens, they won't make noises. How do you keep water out of a tub toy? Even when you do get one to play a sound, you can barely hear it. And believe it or not, they include a sheet of music to let you tap to the tune of children's songs. I'd love to see that demonstrated. It's also a bad design - the rings that the dolphins sit in do NOT stay linked together. Slight movements that disturb the water will cause the chain to come apart and that makes my 3-1/2 year old upset.Another annoyance is the lack of matching colors. The dolphins and the rings are not the same color. Over all, a cute and colorful toy, but also a complete waste of money. Unless you like to see them just float around, you will be disappointed."
3,"Fun, but not for the musically inclined.","My daughter....now 12 months old likes to play with the rings, but not so much the dolphins. The dolphins will make different musical sounds, but often fill up with water and have to be emptied to make any noise. Do not buy this product if you are interested in making music. If your child just wants to play with a tub toy, it is just fine."
5,Fun & Entertaining!,"This is a very fun toy with bright colors, cute dolphins and fun whistle noises! My 16-mth old just loves to tap them on the heads so they'll ""sing."" For the people who gave it negative reviews...I don't know what they expect from a cute little $12 children's bath toy. I say its well worth it!"
1,Not too pleased with this toy,I wouldn't really recommend this toy as one of my 19 month old son's favorites. I bought this toy expecting that it would be fun. They don't even really stay linked together when I put them in the water. They come apart so easily that the majority of the time is spent continually linking them back together. Some of them make a cute squeky sound when you tap their heads but they certainly don't make 'music'. They get water stuck in them and you have to pick them up out of the tube and let the water out in order for them to make another sound when you tap the heads. I definitely don't think it was worth what I paid for it.
2,this toy is all wet,I bought this two years ago for my son's 2nd birthday. He's a real bath lover. What a disappointment! The rings don't stay locked together most of the time and once in a blue moon you will get a faint tone out of one of them when bobbed just right in the water. My kids prefer the water fingerpaints and boats to this thing. I paid for this toy at an upscale toy store back then. What a big waste.
3,"First, alter your expectations...","Like many of the others, I was expecting great things from this toy. However, it didn't meet my expectations. I thought we would have great fun making music in the tub - but the whistles are pretty pathetic. On the other hand, it is good for matching up colors and learning their names (how many 2 year olds know ""aqua"" and ""magenta""?). (Note, though, that the dolphins and rings are made of different plastics so it's not an exact match!) It wasn't a total loss, but it's not a great find either."
3,Not worth it!,"Purchased this for my son who is 2 and I find the dolphins everywhere but the bathtub. Number 1, there are just too many parts to this musical symphony. Number 2, you have to hit it such a way to make noise and sometimes, just not audible. I find it very cumbersome and hard to put away after a bath."
1,Not what I expected.,The dolphins do not really make a very good sound. When they get too wet they don't play at all. I would not recommend this toy at all. It's cheap and doesn't perform. Sorry....
2,Disappointed mom,I can't believe I didn't read reviews on this product before purchasing! My son enjoys making music on his piano and drums and I was looking forward to getting these dolphins for months. The dolphins are hard to connect together and do not stay connected. I cannot get anything but a lame chirp out of the dolphins either. They are relatively cute bath toys (the color of the flotation rings and dolphins don't match like they do in all the photos) but don't serve the purpose for which they were intended.
1,buy a rubber duckie instead,Significantly flawed design -- dolphins take on water easily &no long make the whistling sound. Save your money and just buy a standard inexpensive floating toy.
3,Less Fun Than it Looks,Received this for my 1-yr-old and he still plays with it sometimes - he is now 3. It is really hard to get it to play music how it is intended to be played with. It is also way too big - I hate drying out all of the peices all the time when my son is done with it in the bath. He likes to play with the dolphins individually and just pretends with them instead of using it as it as advertised. It has poor musical ability...Buy something more fun with your money!
2,Disappointment,"This was a gift to my 18 month old daughter from a family member. These other reviews are correct. The toy is not loud - imagine a weak squeaker. The dolphin rings don't stay connected (my 4yo was extremely frustrated), the only ""music"" they play is when one uses the back of the box to find the corresponding notes with each dolphin and play the notes one by one. My daughter likes to put the dolphin rings on her finger...that's the only thing we get from this toy."
1,not worth it,"These dolphins are fun to blow through with your mouth, but they work POORLY in the water. They work better when the water has been drained out of them before placing them in their innertubes in the water. But seeing as they are water toys, it doesn't make much sense to do! My boys were 2 and 5 when we got them as a gift. They are now 4 and 7 and still don't like them. I just gave them to Goodwill."
4,great company,"I loved the idea of the bath toy that sings. They arrived and half of them did not. wrote the company, they replaced it. Now they work much better."
4,Good toy,"My daughter is 8 and has wanted this for years. Grandma finally caved and bought it for her, even though we all knew that she is a bit old for it. My daughter still likes it as a bath toy. She agrees that the dolphins don't really make ""music"" and the rings can be difficult to put together sometimes. However, they are rainbow dolphins and anything rainbow is great with a young girl. Overall, this toy was a hit and it's a fun bath toy if you're expectations aren't too high."
1,Does not work,"The dolphins cannot make music when water gets in them, which is constantly. The rings do not stay linked together. The dolphins are cute & my 1-year-old enjoys dunking a dolphin & watching bubbles come out the top of the toy, but that's about it. Very poorly designed."
4,"Dolphins, not ducks!","This may be just me, but I hadn't looked at the description very well and these appeared to be ducks to me, not dolphins. It didn't much matter, I just was a little surprised when I opened the box! These are very vibrant, and made a perfect gift for my nephew.While I didn't get to try them out, they do appeared to be well made and up to the challenge of a 1 year old. There were no small parts evident that would preclude him from using it even though the recommended age is 18 months."
4,Seems OK,"I replace my shocks because the originals, at 113000 miles, were inadequate. These are pretty and they do the job. They weren't too expensive and fit like designed. I'm happy."
3,feel like hugh,A good game which makes fun to play. But if you like to see some more sex you're wrong with this game. For this i would prefer sites like eroticpcgames.com
4,hey Boso,I really enjoyed this! It keep me well entertained I do have a thing for clowns.There is some bad reviews on A. don't know why I sure would have a look and deceide for myself if I were you.
1,How NOT to make an idie film,"I am a huge indie horror fan and I must say that film was a sad piece of work. The script... well I'm not sure there was one. I have seen trees act better than these actors... On the cover of this the quotes say ""Freighting"" (they must be talking about the dialogue) and ""Intense"" (I couldn't wait for the film to end, so that was kinda intense).I saw a review that said Shivers the clown will be an icon such as Freddy or Jason... The only way this will happen is if Shivers dies and is reincarnated as Freddy or Jason.I gave it one star for using a mini Jib and Dolly and for at least pointing the camera in the right direction.Horrible film unless you love extremely long, slow, drug out scenes with no pay off. There was more blood shed in Fraggle Rock."
2,Fear Of Boring Clown Movies,"O.K., for an ultra-low budget film the clown makeup of the character Shivers was good and the lighting was done well but that's about it. The story was really dull and allthough you had some really promising scenes the payoff was always lackluster. The thing that really ruined this film for me was the stupidity of it. As the clown attacks his victims none of them screem and as the clown walks over to them they just stand there staring at him. There's a scene when a police officer handcuffs the wrong clown, now this all happens in broad daylight and in a residential neighborhood, Shivers comes from behind the cop with a big ax and cuts of his head(It looked really cheezy), Shivers walks away and the handcuffed clown on the ground never once screems or even tries to get up and run. I wanted to like this movie but it was just too dum, but I think with a little more practice Kevin Kangas could become a good director, just have someone help you write the next script, please."
2,This movie sucks!,I love horror movies and i am afraid of clowns so i thought this movie would be really good. so i rented it with my money and boy was i dissapointed. The acting sucked you dont see anyone being killed (well you sorta do) but dont waste your time with this unless you like to waste it!
2,"Where .. The Horror, Fear, & Good Stories Telling, Not Here","Ok .. lets say, I brought this DVD & now, I wished I didn't. It's ok , to watch & than forget & watch a real horror .. movies, about clowns ""ClownHouse"" or even the movie ""Killer Klowns From Outer Space"". Yes!..Tobe Hooper ""The Funhouse"" just to have fun .. with a good horror movie.Where my ""Dawn Of The Dead"" ...."
2,LMAO,"Order a pizza, invite your most sarcastic wise cracking friends over and laugh your arses off. This movie was very very bad: wooden acting, plot holes a mile wide and a ridiculous deranged ""monster"" who is neither scary nor believable. There's juvenile gratuitous nudity and lots of blood. Awful but still recommended for a good chuckle."
1,FATAL........FOR YOUR POCKET!!!,This was one of the worst movies I'v ever bought through amazon. Low budgeted and BOOOORING.
1,BAD MOVIE,THE GIRL IN THE MOVIE WAS CUTE.. THE ACTING SUCKED AND THE STORY LINE WAS TERRIBLE.. AND THERES A 2ND MOVIE.. I THINK I WILL SAVE MY MONEY
1,A Complete Joke,"I'm not a big fan of clown movies, but my friend rented this film for a ""scary movie night"" (lame, yes). Five minutes into the movie, my friends and I started laughing hysterically at the incredibly bad acting in this film. This is by far (and without exaggeration) the worst movie I have ever seen. I couldn't even watch the entire thing because it was incredibly stupid. Terrible, terrible acting and a horrible plot.Do not purchase this movie unless you're looking for a good laugh. Actually, just don't purchase the movie at all."
1,terrible quality,"The quality was terrible. Completely amateur directing, editing, and video. Absolutely hate this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anybody."
4,live recording album,this recording is live - in one of the pieces you can even hear people talking in the background ....my main interest in the recording was 'round midnight - a note for note transcription of which is readily available
5,Author! Screenwriter!,"As an aspiring author and screenwriter, I found this book very helpful. Besides the important basic information as to how to find an agent and submit and protect your work, Peter Miller gives examples of ten different proposal genres. I found this to be an extremely educational and insightful book."
5,An invaluable source for the serious writer,"This book is filled with Peter Miller's insider information on how to get published AND how to get your work sold in the fickle Hollywierd market. The collection of proposals at the end of the book is worth the cost alone! I have read many, many books on writing and publishing and Author! Screenwriter! is by far one of the best. Anyone who is serious about getting published NEEDS to read this book!"
3,Differentiate your books - or stop writing them,"Jack Trout is an excellent writer and has important insights about the importance of differentiation. That being said, I especially liked this book the first two times I read it when it was titled ""Positioning"" and ""The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing."" Personally I'd be a bit embarassed to use 50% of the exact same cases and examples from previous books and still charge ( ). Apparently a harvest strategy and not a good way to differentiate oneself.That being said, if you haven't read anything by Jack Trout or Al Ries then this book, or one of the aforementioned books, is essential reading for marketing and brand managers."
4,"Quick, Write Me a Book, Jack.","This book is good for any manager under 40 who has not seen all the fads last time they came around, or has not taken the trouble to read the thicker and more rigorous text books on strategy.It is thin - value chain is not in the index, and customers (satisfaction) are only listed once - how can you seek ways to improve your market position without a detailed ( = quantitative) review of where you sit in the value chain or to know exactly what the customer wants (rather than what you can tart up from the current catalogue.It's a good checklist - otherwise it would have been just two stars.Other Trout books are very good - this one appears to be harvesting the reputation rather than adding to it."
3,too obvous examples,"Even though Jack Trout has tried to illustrate his theory by many diverse examples, moslty those examples have been obvious. However, troughout the book he clearly makes a point: do things in 'unique' way, otherwise other competitors will take the market share."
5,Brilliant!,"I read this book as research for my undergraduate dissertation. It is a really good light read, easy to understand with interesting and funny examples. I particularly like the fact that it is not too academic, its more of a practical understanding of the need for differentiation and the way companies have achieved (or not) differentiation. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject area. It is a light, enjoyable read."
3,Good read - but doesn't reveal anything new,"As a 23 college grad, I was interested in learning something I didn't already new. While this book was interesting and a good read, everything it reveals is common sense. Not necessarily what most companies practice, but what they should.The best part of the book is the use of real-world examples.Great to borrow from a library, but I wouldn't necessarily go out and buy it."
1,"Go Ahead, Watch Season 4","I liked Bramwell Seasons 1-3 because I like the glimpse into history. As far as being a compelling series, well, it was right up there with Murder, She Wrote. Nice to watch, but towards the end, I wasn't exactly sitting on the edge of my seat.All the negatives you've read about Season 4 are true. Season 4 could've stood as a (bad) standalone 3-hour drama about a female doctor during the second Boer War. She's a bit like the person from the Bramwell series, but you'll find her a lot less likeable, a lot more cold, a lot more loose. There's not much in Season 4 to bridge to the first three seasons, so it's not like it'll ruin anything for you.The filming was noticeably different as was background music, which I never even noticed in Seasons 1 to 3. This is a good example of how unbelievably fractured a series can become, for no apparent reason. The difference is jolting and your memories of the series will probably never even include these last few hours' worth."
1,Season 4 is Really Terrible,"The first 3 seasons of this show are great, but Season 4 is terrible. It actually ruins the series and puts a bad taste in your mouth. They make all of the characters that you've grown to love do dark and nasty things, completely out of character with what was developed over the first 3 seasons. And they ruin the ending. I strongly suggest you don't watch this, you may very well be sorry you did. I wish I could erase it from my memory!!!! Really, it is that bad, don't watch it, even out of curiosity. Pretend it ends with Season 3."
1,Change in seasons,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this season in most ways deviated from the previous format. Everything was edgier from the characters, setting, even the music left me unsettled, like watching a sinister movie plot. Why does the writer take such a change in course, does it parallel a harsher London at the time? This style change doesn't explain the gross change in all the characters. I was hooked enough on the series to watch it. By comparison it wasn't a feel-good season if that's what you're looking for. Still glad I found how the series ended since I was captivated by her character of the times!"
1,Stop at season III,Season 1-3 were wonderful. Season 4 was the worst production quality I've ever seen. I make better home movies. Season 4 was melodramatic garbage. Blech.
1,This is not Bramwell,"The first three seasons were excellent. In Season 4, Jemma Redgrave, Kevin McMonagle and Ruth Sheen were top notch, as was the production in general. However, the storyline was dreadful. The real Bramwell ended with the last episode of Season 3. Season 4 was a waste of money and time."
2,Series 1-3 were Superb...Series 4 dreadful!,"I enjoyed Series 1-3 immensely. The stories, acting, directing, and character building was first rate. After seeing Series 4 I am scratching my head wondering what happened and why was everything so different including the opening. It was a complete let down when Eleanor all of a sudden lost interest in Joe and pursued a man she barely even knew. This was not believable to say the least especially after the two had gotten so close in Series 3. I am so disappointed I don't even feel like bothering with Disc 2. I feel like giving that different production company a piece of mind but it's so after the fact by 12 years to be exact. If they ever read this, I would say this to them, ""What were you thinking??!!"""
5,Great recharger,"This takes all kinds of batteries, from old rechargeable alkalines to NiMH to NiCD, and of all the standard sizes. It allows for trickle-charging, and shuts itself down after the battery is fully charged to prevent over-charging, so you don't damage the batteries if you forget to remove them. It really is the best charger out there, hands down.Note that I got the PS3 model. I hear that some people are getting the PS3D model. I don't know what the difference is."
5,Great Charger,"I purchased this to recharge my ""C"" and ""D"" rechargeable batteries. It works very well and does a great job. I like the fact that it has lights which go off when the batteries are charged. It is also very easy to use. I am considering purchasing another as a gift. This was purchased to recharge batteries for my flameless candles and I have not been disappointed in its ease of use of performance thus far. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a charger that will recharge all sizes of rechargeable batteries."
4,Good charger,We have used this a few times and are quite happy with it. It holds 4 D cell and seems to chargequite quickly.
5,As promised,"Works as promised, absolutley no problems. If I needed another one I would buy one just like it."
1,BOOM!,"It was about the 10th time I had used this recharger and it actually blew up on my desk! No collateral damage to report, and I'm unsure if it was the battery or the charger at fault, but I will not buy another one of these."
3,"Works well, but too big & slow","This item seems to be good after few days of use. The charging does takes long time - it took an overnight charge for 6 AA batteries.Also, the size is too big. I may look for alternatives."
2,Heavy and bulky!,"The price is low and it charges all types of batteries, but there is a catch:It is very heavy compare to other chargers and bulky. (I assume it uses the old transformer technology instead of switching technology) So not a good choice especially when traveling. And it takes up to 14 hours to charge the batteries. I also experienced the same problem with the charging light indicators described in another review.My recommendation: pay a bit more and get a light 15 min charger.However, if you are planning to keep it in one place and charge all sorts of batteries, then this is a good choice."
5,Excellent battery charger.,It has the features that count and gets the job done unless you're using this for a busienss perhaps. Great for home use. This would work well with Rayovac's new Hybrid series NiMH batteries.
1,Not Happy,"Takes longer and longer to charge batteries, and I say charge with a wink since the batteries act like a third of a normal batteries time. I bought Rayovac so it would be name brand and be ""reliable"" right? You can only charge one 9 volt at a time, is that normal? what a waste of 12 hours to charge.I will go with a different brand, Im just annoyed because I bought a bunch of the rechargable batteries to go with this one, (also name brand Rayovac) why does it take SOOOOO long to charge, and then have such a whimy weak charge? Next time I go with a different brand."
2,THIS CHARGER SUCKS!,"I've had it for over a year and have used it 3 times. There is not automatic off when the battery is charged so it ends up leaking. I can't tell when it's fully charge either. And I used Rayovac batteries and after charging and you have them for standby, the loose the charge. I don't use batteries that often but when I do, I don't want to play a guessing game."
4,Rayovac Universal Battery Charger,"At first I was thrilled with this charger. The versatility is fantastic! The fact that we can charge AA, AAA, C, D, & 9-volt batteries is so convient. You can even charge different types at the same time but not in the same slot. It charges the batteries pretty quickly & has a feature that protects them from being over charged. You can leave them in the charger for as long as you want. My current disapointment is it seems that one of the slots isn't working. I haven't even had this bugger for 6 months. It doesn't seem to work no matter the type of battey I install. It always indicates any of these batteries are charged when they are in fact DEAD. I don't get it, I'm hoping that I'm wrong about this, but it isn't looking too good. It's a great dissapointment. I console myself with the knowledge that I have many more slots available.....if they keep working."
4,Perfect if you don't need speed.,"The only fault I can find with this charger is that is not as fast as some of the others out there. But as far as I was able to find, this is the only charger that can recharge all the major types of batteries (AA, AAA, C, D, and 9V). You can even charge different size batteries at the same time, as long as they are in separate compartments. The flexibility of this charger is what makes it worthwhile.If you just keep some extra batteries on-hand, you can always have some charged and ready. Another good thing is that you can leave them in the charger without any ill effect on the batteries."
4,Nice Charge,"This is a slow computer controlled charger( compare to others).It won't overchange batteries, and slower changing is better for batteries. It can charge all type of betteriesHowever this is a fairly large charger. It is bigger thanwhat the picture appears to be."
4,Rayovac Universal Battery Charger,"Good except that it takes too long to charge, 3 to more than 12 hours."
1,The worst basketball dvd in the history of the world,"This was a lame, putrid, appauling, and horrid excuse for a DVD. It contained no NBA footage and about 3 seconds of highschool highlights. This so-called documentary of Kobe Bryant is absolutely worthless and the makers of this film should be shot and executed if not tried for fraud. I believe the makers of this DVD owe all the people who purchased it and apology as well as Kobe Bryant. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! DO NOT TAKE THIS DVD IF ITS GIVEN TO YOU! DO NOT EVEN ACCEPT THIS DVD IF SOMEONE PAYS YOU TO TAKE IT OFF THERE HANDS!!!!! Enough said."
1,No NBA highlights :(,"Very dissappointed with this DVD. All NBA related content on the DVD (except for their practice sessions) consists only of still pictures.The DVD does have highlights from his highschool years (limited). I can't really say too much... I was so dissappointed I fast forwarded through the entire DVD hoping to find at least 1 measily NBA highlight... did not find any :(DVD consists of highschool highlights, interviews with teammates, and still images of NBA related content, and a clip or two of the Lakers during a practice session.I don't recommend this DVD to anyone. Wait for an official NBA DVD on Kobe"
5,Great Biograpy,"I thought this was a great DVD. I especially liked the interviews with fellow teammates, coaches etc. I'm glad to see a DVD that isn't full of highlights, but actual people talking about this great player!"
2,low level of difficulty,"The book is classified as late intermediate and early advanced. These are, at best, early intermediate. Very simple. No challenge at all for a late intermediate player."
5,Martha Mier Jazz Rags & Blues Bk 4,Have absolute admiration for Martha Miers ability to write in ANY genre - great for entertaining and interesting students - downloaded to Kindle BUT now how do I play it - tried printing no joy - tried upping font of notes - no joy so in a way what do others do with music downloaded for a Kindle -
4,Amazing Jazz book,"This book is recommended by musical teacher. My daughter is very fond of it. The only reason I gave it as 4-star is, somehow, I got a copy without CD which I thought it should come with CD. Really don't know how it happened."
2,headset echo,I bought this item and after using it everyone i talk to complains of the echo they hear.It works wellbut the echo heard on the other end is the downside
3,Could be better...,"The sound quality is pretty good, loud and clear. I am not sure how it sounds on the other end. But, the design of the microphone is a little odd. It's located really far from your mouth, so you would have to clip the microphone piece to your shirt when you want to use it. Sometimes, I wear clothes that don't allow me to clip it very easily. It's an oversight on their part."
5,Outstanding performance,"I couldnt believe this headset is only costing 5 bucks, that's very well! I bought some other headsets for like 20 dollars but they are not as good as this one. For sure, I dont expect to compare with high quality branded headset that cost hundred dollars. This one is valuable and I dont even worry of losing it."
1,Get another headset...,"I guess you get what you pay for. This is certainly the case with this headset, which I tried using with my Palm Treo 700. I was hoping to get something that would perform better than a Bluetooth, but was quickly disappointed. This headset, even at its best, sounds like you're listening to a phone call in a hollow chamber. And my callers on the other end complained of the same sound quality. I suggest getting another brand, this one isn't worth the money."
4,Best for treo,"Owned these earbuds for more than a year an i'm very pleased.Only drawback is that they are kind of big for the ear canal.If used on a PALM OS TREO, i deeply advise you to look for a free software called ""HEADSET CONTROL"" that will allow you to skip/play/pause/etc. songs just by using the headset button."
2,You get what you pay for,"I ordered two of these because they were so cheap. Neither one worked very well. On one set, I could only get sound out of one ear bud no matter what I did. On the other set, I could get sound out of both. I only use them for listening to audio books and music on my cell phone. I'm not able to actually use them to talk on my phone. I have a Motorola 9q. I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume. I don't plan on buying these again."
2,To big to fit ear canal,"This one does not work for me, as the earpieces are too big and keep falling out. The original Palm headset works much better."
1,chaep & Inferior,This product is basically a wate of time and money. I bought this headset to serve its purpose of playing my music and it only lasted a week. I want a refund!!!
1,My phone stopped working,"The headset works OK for listening to e-books, which is what I wanted. But since the first time I plugged it to my Treo 650, all phone functions of the treo stopped working: I hear the phone ringing but cannot hear my interlocutor and he cannot hear me either. My local Palm dealer, whom I consulted afterwards, told me never to use non Plam accessories and that the same happened to him with a non Plam headset. So now I have just a very heavy and expensive MP3 player / PDA and need to purchase a new phone."
2,My senior cat can't chew these...,"I was really hoping my senior kitty would like these as much as the regular nu-cat supplements which he loves and I have given him as a 'treat', but, these are a different formula/flavor and too hard for him to chew which was very disappointing. He also doesn't seem too thrilled about the smell because they don't have the beefy-livery scent like the non-senior nu-cat supplement pills. At first, he tried a few times to chew the pills and often the pill would fall out of his mouth because he couldn't crush it in his mouth.So, I've decided to grind these pills up in my spice grinder and add 1/4 teaspoon to his wet food each day instead, but, after he's gone through this supplement I am switching him back to the regular nu-cat pills which he goes crazy for."
5,"Excellent, detailed review of two beautiful parks","Park BasiX DVDs aren't for everyone, maybe, but they are great for what they are. If you're looking for an introduction to the parks, including views of hiking trails, this is the way to go. Or if you've been to the parks and know you love them, and just want to have the opportunity to see some of your favorite sights again, this is the way to go.This is not a polished, Hollywood production DVD, but that's part of what I like about it. When I watch, I feel like I'm in the park, on the trail. And since I can't travel year-round to my favorite parks, this makes a nice substitute. I wish the good folks at Park BasiX would make one of these DVDs for every park in the system.Before our first visit, we used this DVD to help our young children pick out which trails they wanted to hike, which helped them to be excited and enthusiastic despite the high temperatures in July. Today they are national park junkies as well."
5,Not Much To Say,"I've been using 150's for many years om my Strats, Kramers and Ibanez guitars. They sound great and sound great for a long time. I'm sure personal preference has a lot to do with guitar strings, but IMO you can't go wrong with Fender strings."
1,Very misleading,"This book IS NOT ABOUT OGOPOGO, the mystery creature of Canada's Lake Okanagan. The creature does not even make an appearance in this story. It is an okay murder mystery, but based upon the way it is packaged I was sorely disappointed.Also, the author fills the second half of the book with ""facts"" about Ogopogo and the creature candidates that may actually exist within Okanagan and other lakes throughout Canada. Almost all his facts are in serious error."
2,Disappointing,"You will find that the Shadow skill movie/volume 2 still has wonderful fight scences but picks up many problems. The art in the movie is extremely low, especially compared to the OAV. The artists used extremely dark, heavy lines which looks tacky. They also made a few revisions on certain people's appearances (i.e. Scarface) the result isn't very attractive in the least bit. This movie also doesn't pick up after the OAV, it instead deals with things that occurred before the OAV which doesn't add any new value to the original story. It's frankly annoying. The voice acting isn't good in the least bit. Chances are that if you liked the first OAV like me then you'll find the movie to be extremely disappointing."
1,Worst set,"Worst set of sheets I've ever owned. Washed them, and put them on the bed directly out of the drier: The fitted sheet ripped at two different corners."
2,Starting to pill after one wash and dry,"The material was very soft and the pockets certainly big enough for my double pillow-top mattress, but after the first washing (without chlorine bleach)and machine dry, it is starting to pill already. That's disappointing. It still fits fine on the bed."
3,It's a sheet.,"It's definitely a good set of sheets. Way better than I thought they would be after reading some of the reviews here. Wasn't expecting something like silk, but it is very soft."
3,poor conversion to kindle format - 1 star for kindle format,"This review concerns the kindle version of the book, not the contents of the actual book. The book itself is a good book but has been converted very poorly into kindle format. The table of contents doesn't work and chunks of the text are missing (we also have the paperback to compare). We had to return this kindle version because it was so rife with problems.5 stars for the content, 1 star for the kindlization."
4,Pretty good deal,"This has worked for us. Pretty easy to put up. It actually is less than 10' x 10' at the top and more than that at the bottom. The first time I put it up, I left it out overnight and heavy rain and wind knocked it down and bent all 4 poles. I was bummed but actually just pounded the poles back straight and its OK now. So its a little light weight, but worth the price."
1,Wenz.. 10x10,Two of the plastic pieces that hold the poles together broke on the second day of use. I have attempted to purchase some of the new pieces but haven't gotten a response from FOGDOG. If you buy this product make sure you don't place the item in a breeze and don't expect any service from FOGDOG.
2,Mixed bag,"Frankly, I haven't been all that impressed with any of the repair manual's issued for Volvo. All third-party manuals tend to be vague and overly broad; Chilton's is particularly poorly focused, unnecessarily ambitious in model year breadth and maddening incomplete in coverage. I cannot reccomend this manual as a sole source for the enterprising shade tree mechanic. Yet, there are times when I find it as an essential compliment to the Haynes manual. Haynes is published out of England, and tends to ignore features specific to US model cars (FI troubleshooting is a weakness of the Haynes; Chilton's manual covers this area at an acceptible level."
1,Verry Poor Manual,They tried to cover too much in too little space. Very limited electrical schematics and poor descriptions. Sorry I bought it and am looking for another one.
2,There are better options,"Yes, this book does cover a models, and for that I give it two stars. However, many times I felt like I was doing something wrong. The book can too short sometimes, leaving the reader wondering what to do next.Volvo is a company that needs more car manuals. They make very good cars and it's a shame that most of the better manuals are not sold in stores.If you want to learn more about your Volvo, then get this book along with your dealer's manuals. I also highly recommend Auto Repair for Dummies by Deanna Sclar."
1,Works great when kneeling on ground,"I own a 940 and this book was my only option for purchase at the local parts shop. I bought a Chiltons book in the past for a previous car and was thinking maybe they improved the quality of information...sad to say its still horrible. One thing Chiltons got going for them is that they have great distribution, Haynes really needs to work on their distribution and get out to all the car parts stores, I always have problems finding Haynes books.Needless to say this book tries to cover a wide range of models and falls flat on its face like a mumbeling drunk. Case in point the information on how to change the external high pressure fuel pump on a 940 is worthless. Save your money, time and frustration and look online at forums for repair advice and get yourself a Haynes repair manuel.Volvo 940 Petrol Service and Repair Manual: 1990 to 1998 (Haynes Service and Repair Manuals)"
3,not very good,"the book is o.k. some items are good, some are not in detail, it is not very clear, i think this book is o.k. but not very good,"
1,Chilton's Volvo Repair 1990-98,"Next to worthless, this ""repair manual"" tried to fit too many models in one book. Very poorly done and a waste of money."
2,Ineffective compared to gel,"I had bought the P21S gel product and been very pleased with it. I bought this one, regular non-gel version, in error; it is far less effective. Wheels need a lot of brushing and are still not clean. In comparison, with the gel, I could get the wheels nearly totally clean without any brushing (just spray and hose off after a few minutes).Car is 2012 Audi A6 with 19 inch wheels."
3,Not Worth the $$$$$,"I was hoping this cleaner, touted as one of the best for removing the annoying brake dust that quickly builds up on the front wheels of my German made car, would do the job. I clean the car regularly, and have used Simple Green for years to remove brake dust, and for a multitude of other cleaning jobs. P21s was about as effective as Simple Green, but costs many times more, and is just as environmentally safe from what I can tell. I can't see spending about 10 times the money, ounce for ounce, for a cleaner that is no better than a readily available general cleaner that does the same job. P21s is very good, to be sure, but for my money, I'm sticking with Simple Green.simple green All-Purpose Industrial Cleaner/Degreaser"
5,"Fast, fun, intriguing read, with authenticity & good twists!","Congrats to 86-year old Martin Garaway for writing such a fine mystery novel, which proved to be a real page-turner for me. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next! Also, the author made wonderful use of the experiences he had while living on the Navajo reservation (the setting for his book) and in London, lending such authenticity and life to his characters, plot and sub-plots. The way in which one of the sub-plots was wrapped up was not what I expected (nor would have wanted) it to be, but nonetheless, was fairly realistic. And there was a wonderful twist at end of the book!"
4,The Professor and the Pot,"A delightful, entertaining read with some painless lessons neatly woven in. Garaway knew more than most white Americans about Native American culture, and how widespread and devastating the theft of their artifacts is. A mystery as good as any out there, with enough wit to make you smile throughout. The hero is a real person, and we laugh with him even as we are afraid for him. A most worthwhile pleasure."
4,Can Change Your Thinking,"Todd Skinner has written a book that invites you to change how you think about challenges and obstacles. Especially pertinent were his specifics such as considering ""measuring your progress from where you are to the summit"" instead of where you began. There are several ""aha"" moments to be found in Beyond the Summit that do not ask you to understand a complex model of management or leadership, that are quite profound and immediately useful. Practical and inspirational."
3,There are some good songs here,"I'd easily give this album 4 stars but the fact remains there are not enough strong tracks. Still for what its worth they deffinately have promise. The first two songs are very unique with heavy bass lines that add a eletronica/rock hybrid in an orignal way, the rest of the music here tends to be in the shadow of persay.. Lacuna Coil and on several songs Loreena Mckennit perhaps. Anyway still they do have some great ideas and I will have a wacthful eye on them."
5,Dark-wave as it best!,"This album is great,genial and formidable.It is the best dark-wave album in 2000!Please don't miss it!"
4,Rhea's goes mainstream... sort of...,"Just got my copy of Between Earth & Sky, and it is definitely the most arresting R.O. disc to date in my opinion.I believe this is the first English-speaking CD, although I don't think that's the reason it's so much more enjoyable. I think the band sounds freer, happier and bolder. The rhythm section is spot-on, and Sue Hutton's vocals have never been better.I had the pleasure of meeting the band at the two past La Femme Nikita conventions, and found them engaging, funny, and very polite... not what you'd expect from an alternative band, but there it was!I will watch their progress very carefully, and will always seek out their work.I strongly suggest you do the same.Natalie"
3,Rhea's passion,"SwitchBlade Symphony meets Siouxsie and the Banshees, just a bit more mature. Passion for the masses. ""Spiritual Fear"" a definite hit off this album. Not quite a Metropolis release, but it'll do."
2,Disapointed,"I was very disapointed. The women can't sing. They sounded very cheesy and bland. Every now and then you night hear a sound that hits the spot, but most of the time tumbs down.. They got old real quick. I don't really think I will be listening to this album much at all. Don't waste your money."
4,A great story,My kids enjoyed it. For me that's more then good enough. Today you don't have stories as good as this one. We need to get back to more like this one.
5,Classic on every level!,"I recieved this for christmas after one of the library tape copies broke when we tried to rewind it, and was so thrilled! When we saw this on dvd at target, i actaully hung around the holiday movie section just to see it anyone would consider it! this is one of my favorite christmas movies ever."
5,Finally on DVD,I have waited a very long time for this one to come out on DVD. Some are complaining that it is to short and should have been lumped with some other Rankin and Bass shows. I was just happy to finally be able to add it to my DVD collection.
2,SKIPS AND SURFACE NOISE,"THE FIRST CD BABY CAN ROCK BY COLLINS ON THIS LABEL WAS VERY GOOD. THIS CD IS NOT. VERY LITTLE WAS DONE TO REMOVE TICKS, SURFACE NOISE AND EVEN SKIPS. ALSO IT WAS RECORDED ON A HOME TYPE CD WHICH IS MORE EASLY SCRATCHED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF THE SOUND QUALITY WERE MUCH BETTER. I RETURNED THE CD AND WAS GIVEN FULL CREDIT."
5,The CD is Hot!,This CD is a blessing and inspiration. The music and lyrics are awesome! I am so glad that I purchased this CD and I recommend it to any individual that likes any type of music. There is something on this CD for everyone. My CD player is on repeat...
3,"Tasty, but not so ""Extra Hot.""","Just a forewarning for any of you looking for ""extra hot"" horseradish, this is not what you want.Don't get me wrong, it has a nice taste, but if your looking for the clear your sinuses and moisten your eyes heat that horseradish can provide, this product won't do it for you.On the flip side of the coin, if you are having guests over and you want to prepare your own cocktail sauce or other horseradish based item and you are entertaining senior citizens or small children that can't handle the heat, then this isn't a bad idea. It is slightly hot by itself, but once you mix it with anything, the heat is gone and even children shouldn't have a problem with it.Thumbs up for taste. Thumbs down for heat.Enjoy!"
5,Greatest cartoon classic,"In my opinion the Pink Panther cartoons are the best of all time.Volumes 1,2 and 3,from 1964 to 1975,are a must for anyone into ARTS(so prolific and creative in those days).If you've seen these in your childhood,like myself,hurry and buy them:i assure you'll love them the same.If you haven't,don't miss the opportunity to know the greatest cartoons ever!"
5,Very Pleased,We were very pleased with the DVD my daughter wanted for her birthday. We love these old movies and she watches them all the time.
4,Volume 3 is the subject.,"I rather enjoyed this DVD. I am a fan of Pink Panther and my kids love him too. I thought this DVD was fairly good. It wasn't as good as the first and second volumes, but I liked it a lot better than the 4th volume DVD. I recommend that you buy this DVD. It's full of laughs that are remarkable."
4,A Unique Approach to Percussion,"This book is abrilliant piece of work from Peter Magadini. Peter has considered all levels of professionals starting from the novice to the expert who can go on a roll on the drumset. A handy piece of talent is in there with enough tunes to practise making the user a familiar drummer in all the various kinds of music that he can be exposed to. With sufficient pracise to these tunes the drumset player can blend himself into various kinds of music or even practise for fusion of Indian & Western classical. In short ""A GOOD BUY WORTH EVERY CENT"""
1,Julia Roberts really IS in this movie !!,"For the longest time I swore Julia had nothing to do with this awful movie, but sure enough there she is - in bright red pants walking up a staircase in the Firehouse. She doesn't say a word, but it sure is a trip to see her."
1,LAME,This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Please don't waste your time with it. It was stupid and not the least bit funny.
4,Soothing yet varied,"This is one of my better CDs for doing reiki, along with Parijat's ""Buddha Garden"" and Kim Robertson's harp. (I am a newly attuned level 3 practitioner and trying to build up my music library.) My reiki teacher liked it enough to buy it also. It incorporates nature sounds that, as far as I can tell, are real. The slow, solemn phrasing and sweet tones induce a meditative state, yet the whole is underlain with steady drumming and punctuated by gentle ""here I am"" sequences--silvery bells, or a roll of thunder. Not a lot of airy electronics - I like to hear the wood in the guitar and the bamboo in the flute. Reiki is spacey enough as it is; it's helpful to have ""grounded"" music. The CD runs about 50 mins - good for an hour session."
3,What is this?,"I thought it exposed very little important information. I wouldn't recommend it for learning purposes. It had some fun info, through."
5,Great Anime,"We like Anime, but are very picky about what we watch. This set is awsome. A Typical story with lots of girls after 1 guy but with a twist. The hero is someone you can like(good fighter, friendly but poor) and the girls...well they are robots they are constantly learning what it's like to be alive.If you have gotten anime and are worried about the content. This one is very mild. No shown nudity. There is some mild sexual induindos, and some of the marrinots ware scanty clothing in a couple episodes. Also This is a male only planet and one of the humans is constantly being beaten up because he makes passes at the hero.Over all a great set that is a lot of fun"
3,A Guide to Prayer,"You should not beg or be satisfied with your lot in life, but demand inwardly, teaches the guru. You should increase your ""demand power"" by yoga, praying wisely, cultivating inner peace, and concentrating on your real needs. When you do it well, God ""will satisfy your every desire when you are one with Him. Your wildest dreams will come true,"" says Yogananda [p. 66].Maybe they will, maybe not. The guru orator exaggerates. But ""every little helps"". The main method he vouches for, is related to the yoga method of samyama (sanyama), mentioned by Patanjali [ch 3, v 4 ff]. During samyama one focuses in deep meditation on something in order to make it real, manifest (get) it. That is the key to the guru's method, but an idea of ""God"" is not necessary in it in the traditional yoga system - but it may help some."
4,A gift,"Yogananda's words are always a gift. As he says in this beuatiful book ""As a broken microphone cannot broadcast a message, so a restless mind cannot transmit prayers to God"". So by quietening the mind we can gain access to the sanctuary of the soul. He gives us insights on how to go about doing this and how by doing so we can change our lives.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
3,"Good function, lighting is lacking","The gages work great, and were less expensive then most others, however when they are lit there is bright light coming from around the edge of the face of the gages. It is almost as if the black face is set back too far, it lets light around it and is bright. Overall good quality otherwise."
5,WoW!,"This is quite a journey through today's electronic music scene and quite a ""trip"" it is. By the time you're done it'll leave you wanting more.Liquid Crystal Vision fuses the ancient and the future. It blends scenes of exotic places such as Angkor Wat, Goa, Laos, Japan, and others with superb graphics, sounds, performances, and channeled interviews.This film uses dancing as one of the means to initiate a far-reaching personal evolution. It contrasts control versus freedom. The impact of the mystical arts movement on planetary consciousness is highlighted during the 60 minutes play time.Overall it makes an artistic and political statement that leaves a strong imprint on the audience.If you like psy-trance you'll love this dvd.."
5,Dance music,"This is my favorite Rollins album and I have 15 of his discs-- the classics (The Bridge, Sax Collossus, etc.) Has some great dance music. The track ""Kilauea"" is the original version of his new release ""Global Warming."" I play this one constantly!"
4,Good phone with some flaws,"After using this phone for about a year, i've found the core features are all solid: sound quality, range, talk time, nice menu and ringtones, and best/cleanest looking cordless phone on the market. I would probably buy this phone again for lack of better options on the market.Flaws are:- no true mute feature, only a call hold, so not sure how this can be used for conf calls or business uses- keypad is very, very slow, there's almost a 2 second delay between pushing a botton and getting the result of that key press. this is very annoying, but also leads to double key presses, etc.- supports only one phone line, knew this before buying, but would be nice to support more lines, forward calls to second line, etc. panasonic and motorola do have features."
5,System upgrade,"This is a great upgrade from the 4215 system. Like the handset, it takes a while to learn all the functions. Toll saver function is based upon seconds (10) and not rings of the phone (4) which is new. Does not cut off messages like the old system did. Keeps track of time left. Remember to read the manual carefully for the first few weeks to understand how it works. After a few weeks, most of the functions are easy to program."
2,"Great phone, Big flaw!!!",This would be the perfect phone if you didn't have to deal with the horrible echo that can occur while talking on the handset.I can't believe Siemens would release a phone with such an obvious problem.
5,great coverage,"best phone we have had to date. we can get coverage anywhere in the house or yard.Easy to program and use also kept all info during power outage, Including time and date."
1,Don't buy this phone,"For me, this phone has been a lesson in the downside of online shopping. I bought it, plus an extra handset, because it looked good, was made by a reputable company, and got excellent customer reviews. It cost more than most other phones, but I figured, ""you get what you pay for"".Not so, in this case.It looks good in the picture, but the construction is flimsy, the ergonomics poor, the material, which looks like stainless, is actually the cheapest possible plastic. Ours already had a scratch on it when it arrived in the mail.The buttons have a mushy feel to them, and there's an unbearable echo when you speak into the handset.The operator's manual is 50 pages long.I don't know why other reviewers liked this thing. Do they work for Siemens?"
1,Caller ID doesn't work well.,"Big disappointment!! At the start of most calls, there's a weird echo that takes about 30 seconds to subside. Also, the caller id is awful!! Most times the caller id only displays ""External Call"" rather than listing a callers name and number. I've never had this problem before with other phones, and felt that if Siemens cannot even get caller id right, they have no right releasing this phone! Awful!"
5,"It is a very good telephone, I like it!","It is the best phone I ever had. Very good voice quality, a very long standby and talk time, the menue is very easy like a selphone. For me the best phone ever."
5,Perfect for a little princess,"I got this crib for my daughter because it is sturdy, elegant and very girly. It has rose wood molding which adds such beauty. I also have the dresser/changing table. I wasn't sure about it being a changing table at first but now (my daughter is 2 months) I do not know how I managed without it with my son (who is now 6). If you are looking for something elegant and sturdy and relatively easy to put together this is the one for you."
5,Gorgeous crib for great price!,"We had previously found a crib that we loved from Pottery Barn Kids, but the price tag was a little steep considering everything that we need to get for Baby Olivia. We found the Mon Cheri collection and immediately purchased the crib. Aside from how beautiful it is, it is a very sturdy crib. My bumper and mobile work great and the fact that it can grow with our daughter makes it an even better investment. We are going to buy the armoir and dresser/changing table next month to finish the collection."
5,Perfect for my Little Princess,"I bought this crib for my daughter because it is the most elegant, girly bed I have found. It is extremly sturdy. It doesn't shake at all like the cheapies do. This bed is the most gorgeous bed I have seen. (excluding $2,000+ beds) For the price this bed CAN NOT be beat, and it will last a lifetime.It was so easy to assemble. My husband did it the very night I brought it home, and didn't call for help the first time.I will be getting the matching dresser and amoire very soon."
5,What a beautiful crib!,We picked this crib up yesterday and I was so excited to put it together! The only hard part was having my husband bring it into the baby's room by himself! It went together really quickly without any problems in under 30 minutes. There isn't a single scratch on it and it's a really solid piece. I would HIGHLY recommend this crib to everyone!
2,Has anyone read this book?,"The two reviews (so far) for this book were obviously written by the interns at the publishing house or publicist's office.Tells you everything you need to know.Keep on moving, folks. Nothing to see here."
4,A Modest Improvement,"Installed in the fog lights of a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500. They are a modest improvment over the stock no-name bulbs, but nothing special. Light is a little whiter, and spread a little greater, and that is all I really wanted. The price was right, too. I would buy again, and probably will just to have a back up pair."
2,Not worh the money,These are not worth the money! These bulbs have a significantly shorter life than normal bulbs without really adding much more usable light. A much better investment are HIR bulbs which will directly replace 9006 bulbs with very little work but HUGE lighting improvements!
1,Sea Monkeys Are Over Rated,"We were very disappointed with this kit. We followed the instructions exactly. We used purified water, temp control, lighting, aerating the water, feeding etc. When the sea monkeys ""hatched"", we could barely see them. But after a few days they got bigger and we were getting excited. We had about 30 of them. Then by day seven, all but two of them died! They make these creatures out to be like little people. The fact is, they are very small, fragile and much more care taking is involved. The guarantee is also only for replacement, which requires you to send them a shipping fee! Waste of time and money in my opinion."
3,Young children would not appreciate this,"I bought this for myself, and enjoyed it. But the sea monkees were very very small and hard to see. So young children would not be able to appreciate it at all. Also, the text and material that came with it was very fanciful but not at all educational or helpful in explaining the biology of these creatures. I would prefer something more accurate and better as a teaching tool."
1,There O.K but....,Sea monkeys are O.K. But there not very interesting. But they are very low maintenence. Perfect for you moms when the kids are really wanting a pet.
2,"Tank defective, few sea monkeys hatched and all died young","I bought this for my son for Christmas and became way more interested in it than he did. I followed the directions exactly, but I only got a few to hatch and they died within a couple of days (yes, I aerated the tank and did not overfeed). My sea monkeys never got anywhere near as large as the ones in the customer images.One possible reason for this is that the light would not stay lit. Every time I put in new batteries the light would only last a couple of hours. I tried at least four sets of batteries before I gave up. I will probably try again, but I would not buy this particular tank because I believe that the light was defective. I suggest another tank, but I think every kid should have sea monkeys at least once in their lifetime."
1,Be careful,"Be careful of ""astro-turfing""... people who are paid to write rave reviews about certain products... many of the positive reviews about this product are extremely repetitive and sound like they're written by the same person... so... just beware."
2,they're brine shrimp.,"some of these reviews are amazing, seems rather professional to me in most cases.these are just brine shrimp people, feeder shrimp for most fish.you want to learn how to keep a pet buy one, you want to learn how to grow food for it to feed off of then this is the starter kit.it's not a pet it's a food."
4,Fun for Kids and Parents,"The Sea Monkey Ocean of Light is a good invest. As long as you follow the instructions, the growth process folds right before your eyes. There are 4 easy steps to getting the little monkeys on their way. You and your child can read the instructions together, and they can help agitate the water or pour food into the tank. My kid loves watching the little sea monkeys swim around, especially since they are easier to see."
4,Donkey Kong,"If you ever want to buy a sea monkey, buy this one set, it has everything that you need, at a cheap price.Another advice, never take them outside and left them at the sun......"
5,The BEST PET OUT THERE!,"Before I start, This is from a 13 year old's point or view. The whole Sea-Monkey experience for me has been AMAZING! Though it could be more durable, it doesn't mean it's not FUN! I mean I'm not saying it's NOT durable! It totally is! Anyhow...With the Ocean Of Light, you can watch you Sea-Monkeys at ANY time of day! (or night for that matter)You can order color filters that change the color of the light, and you can even perform TRICKS with your Sea-Monkeys! The best part of the whole experiecne is how EASY they are to take care of! You only feed them ONCE A WEEK! There is NO end to the fun! I have 3 tanks of Sea-Monkeys and they NEVER stop amazing me! It's a great summer activity too! While I'm out of school, I am starting my whole Sea-Monkey world over again! (Last time I kinda forgot to feed them...A LOT!) Best of luck to YOU on your educational Sea-Monkey Journeys!"
4,"Fun, fun, fun under the light of your sea monkey tank",This is fun to have. It takes a good month to start really having a blast with you seamonkeys (they need to grow)If you want to see my seamonkeys go to...the pictures are from this tank I bought off of amazon.com
5,Sea Monkeys: Perfect Pets,"I LOVE sea monkeys! I've had two tanks and once I bought them to school as class pets. They are easy to clean, feed, etc. They have tons of cool accesories that you can order from the instruction book that comes with it, including a cool neclace to put the sea monkeys in! Buy them!"
5,Always In The Top Ten,"One of the Best off Metropolis, full of emotions, chills, and just about every bodily feeling imaginable. Die Form is that good. I host a Industrial Radio show at my college station, and among Apoptygma Berzerk, and Faith & the Muse, Die Form always breaks the top ten. If you are new to Die Form, start here!!!!!"
3,"Well, I'm just not quite sure what to think",This album started out for me just perfectly. It was sad and dark and I immediately took to it and added it to my list for great melancholic music. But as the CD progressed the music just got a little too mechanical and silly for me. It conjures up images of people who have too much dark sexual obsession having bizarre rites in their upstairs attics. I guess if you're into that kind of thing then this is GREAT! But I couldn't take it seriously.
1,Very specific and not representative,The book appears to be the authors justification for spending time in this village. It's amazing he found a publisher for this.
3,Was expecting more,"The Genisys tool is very powerful and can do many of the things the buyer hopes it would. This somewhat pricey intro DVD does cover some interesting material that a user most likey would want to know about, however the price, and all of what could have been covered by a complete instrument training program, make this purchase somewhat of a disappointment. If OTC themselves could creat a DVD like this, surely the price could be 1/3 of what this is selling for. And in a perfect world, they would have a volume 2, 3, and possibly more - for around the same reduced price - to truly bring a user of their tool up to speed with it in all the areas that are NOT covered by this DVD."
3,SOOoooo . . .,-- will this movie play on unaltered N. American DVD players? Usually we are given a warning about what world region the disc is playable in. It sounds like Region 2 (not the N. American Region 1) but I can't find note of that.
2,Mediocre!,"These earbuds make me feel like I'm listening to music - underwater. This feature would be nice if my songs were meant to sound like someone's drowning me, but a large majority of them are meant to be heard above the surface. These headphones always make me believe I have a few too many ounces of earwax too, because my inner ear gets suddenly warm, and gooey.They're not that great."
4,Great performance but just above bootleg quality,"This is KISS as rarely seen or heard. A blasting quick-tempoed rock and roll band. Unfortunately both and picture are less than ideal. You can't turn it up because it's just too digitized. It'll sear your ears off - and not in a good way. It's still a great performance and reminds me why I loved KISS in the day. But if you're a KISS fan, pick this up anyway. They never played with the same ferocious elan as they did in 76. The savage beat was eventually tamed by time, Ezrin and commercialism. I give the DVD a 10 for performance and 2 for DVD quality"
5,That's really cool!,"That's really cool novel! One of the most poignant love story of our time. Paradoxal associations with ""Foam of the Daze"" - because the women he loves have died, Michel slowly vanish in Pattaya, like Boris Vian's mice persuade diffident cats to kill them..."
2,Borefest -- with travel and sex,"The story creeps between rambling (long rambling) on travel, economy, or even what someone did for the first three hours of a day (swam laps, did the stairmaster, etc.). I cannot figure out what the ""raves"" by critics are for. I think someone had a good press agent or the reviewers were viagra-needy old men. It's really like a bad Penthouse forum letter combined with really boring, who cares, downright dull predictable, un-unique philosophizing."
4,Life's a crapshoot,"Part one of this novel, ""Thai Tropic,"" seemed so much of a rewrite of Camus's L'Étranger that I almost stopped reading before part two, ""Competitive Advantage."" It was worth sticking to it, though. Yes, the sex is unrealistically great 100% of the time for Michel and everyone else, but this is a philosophical novel and it's pretty clear that Houellebecq is contrasting perfection with the concluding events. His plan works.I also can see why Muslims might not like this book--the putdown of Islam from the mouth of an Egyptian expat on 179 is devastating, and to this agnostic, hilarious.The excessively passive protagonist is hard to connect to, but this story of how love happens kept me reading."
4,houellebecq throwing haymakers,"This book suffers for its first-person perspective. Clearly we see that Houellebecq wishes to 'get into the heads' of his female foil and his supporting male, so we have some amusing scenes where our narrator expounds at length in the third person about Valerie, and then adds an ""I"" after it all to add his commentary. Aside from some strangeness like this, the book is classically Houellebecq: a big hit among the fans, and sure to be hated by the detractors. This is probably the author at his most reactionary, but then with the left in the state that it is, what other option is there?What else? The claims that this book is depressing, misogynistic, etc. are absolutely ridiculous. The one fully formed person in this book is Valerie. She is humanized; she is whole, and for that there is an incredible contrast between Valerie and her male counterparts. Houellebecq is not anti-human; he is a romantic who's disappointed with the trajectory of the world."
2,talking nonsense,"if you want to be turned on and require better reading material than playboy then i would recommend ""the platform' otherwise i defer to voltaire who said, wherever you go in france you will find that the three chief occupations are making love, backbiting and talking nonsense. to that i say, pretty much. it's hard to believe that so many people are willing to accept tired trite 'theories' on black women, latin women, yellow women, white women as high powered intellectual stuff. this is no different from 17th century french porn that obsessed about the size and specialities of black genitalia and pretended to call it science."
2,Not much here,"Not a bad book but pretty light.I guess that's what you get for 10 minutes.Not enough depth for exchange administrators, too much background for occasional admins, not enough for certification.I'm not really sure who this is intended for.The exchange 24/7 and the book by William Boswell (I forget the name) get my two votes for required exchange 2k3 reading."
1,This book was disappointing,"I purchased this book because it claimed to be for beginners; however, it assumes to much prior knowledge in its explanations, and its instructions do not coordinate with the actual function of the software."
2,just okay,this book is okay -- the projects are very ordinary and the fabric shown is not very designer like. There were some good project ideas but nothing very splashy. Much better books available.
4,A very good pump for the price.,"This pump is very handy because of its small size and light weight. It also has an air hose that rotates 360 degrees, which makes it more versatile. Mounting it to the frame was easy, and it will mount to most parts of the bike frame. So far, I've been impressed with this item."
1,Walmart had a better pump,"This was my first high end, brand name pump and I hated it. It looks good but functions poorly. The valve assembly is tough to adjust and if you are switching between presta and schrader alot this is a pain. I found a nice cheap pump at Walmart that I have loved and wish I would have gone with before buying this one."
3,Mountain Morph Pump,"Too many moving parts! The adapter for presta/shrader valve stems has a screw-on nut that has to be loosened to change over for each valve type. This nut has to be tightened once the pump is stowed to ensure that it does not vibrate off while riding so you do not lose your parts, which would render the pump useless, for which there are no replacement parts sold."
4,Works great! eventually wore out.,"This design is great, It's the best I've found. The T grip and the foot peg work great together, eventually I wore it out, and I'd love them to make a heavy duty version, I'd buy it again."
5,Good introduction to Descartes,"Descartes is rightly considered as one of the greatest philosophers of all time. While his thought is subtle and nuanced, his new approach to Philosophy brought about a massive change in the direction of the subject and helped decisively end the medieval synthesis and worldview amoung serious philosophers.This volume contains a series of essays on Descartes by leading experts on Descartes, including John Cottingham. As with the other Cambridge Volumes the bias is towards an analytical interpretation of Descartes, which mostly rejects his dualism as essentially meaningless. Nevertheless, the approach to modern philosophical issues in both the continent and the Anglo-American tradition were very much framed by the sorts of questions posed by Descartes, and his thought repays close and careful study. This volume will help students of Descartes in their quest to understand the thought of this pivotal thinker."
1,Not so great....,"Trilltown Mafia, a group discovered by Trillville leader Don P, doesn't fare well on their first full length album. For one, they follow the Crime Mob route with having females in the group but their lady isn't nearly as potent as Princess or Diamond from the Crime Mob. The other members of the group are just guys...none standing out from the other. The production is typical southern fare...it bumps in any system but the group just doesn't have any personality or any identity. They don't distinguish themselves enough from other groups like Trillville, Crime Mob etc. As a result the come off as Trillville-lite. They lack charisma to hold attention of the listener. There are a couple songs that ride especially Ridin Dirty as well as So Fly, Chit Chat, and Intoxicated. But the rest of the album is uninspired. I wouldn't recommemd this album at all. 1 star."
4,straight crunk!!,this cd will go hard in your ride. For real. Its not bad for those who like crunk music. U can pretty much play the cd all the way thru. It really goes hard for real. Believe me. IF YOU LIKE DOWN SOUTH RAP GO BUY IT!!! Cds like this is the reason people still listen to rap.
4,Very pretty and soft,"My 4 year old picked out this set yesterday. The fleece blanket is really soft and held up to its first washing. I wish the sheets were a little heavier material, but really like the fact that the top sheet is fitted at the bottom end, so it stays in place. I also got the valance and 5 piece wall hanging. The room lookes very soft and feminine now."
3,Nice,"This is a nice set specially if you are doing the transition from the Gossamer Wings Crib set as i was. I have the lamp, valance, wallpaper th whole nine yard and I was looking for something to match her toddler bed. The set has a nice embroidery but the blanket is made of fleece but not the super soft one. It works if you use it with the sheet since I think the material might be too rough on my daughter."
3,"""Miles to go before I sleep...""","Good pacing, the best acting that I have seen from Bronson. Remick provides a great sidekick. Of all the ""Manchurian Candidate"" knockoffs that I have seen this is clearly the best. Soviet madman activates russian sleeper agents to cause general mayhem and sabotage, and Bronson plays a under cover KGB agent sent to the states to put a stop to him. Recommended."
5,RELEASE IT ON DVD !!!,"If you read the reviews on this movie you will seethat since 2000,people want this movie to come outon dvd.They have put some of Bronson's worst piecesof c**p out on dvd yet this excellent movie languishesin vhs hell.I don't like Bronson generally speaking,however he did make a few good films and this one topsmy list.Read the other reviews for info.on the story line.I got tired of waiting for this to come out on dvd so Itransferred my vhs copy onto a blank dvd disc so that atleast it wouldn't deteriorate any further,but I want thereal thing.This movie really is a gem."
4,Frying Frenzy,"My kitchen gremlins somehow swallowed my old deep frying/candy thermometer which I had owned for years. You don't realize how valuable a tool is until you try to complete a task without it.If you use a Wok or pan to deep fry food a good thermometer is essential, and my old Taylor one was well worn.The new model 804 is lighter, longer and more accurate than the one I lost. It has a clear,readable numeric display on the face, and fits large woks as well as large or small pots. All you need to do is adjust the clip to the size of your pot or wok.I would not recommend using this item in smaller pots, as it sticks up too high, and you need to be very careful."
2,not too good,"I have this version and it's almost watchable. SPOILER ALERT::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::SPOILER ALERT::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Not like I'm really spoiling anything, but I thought this movie really went downhill when Sammo died, and it wasn't too good when he was in it."
2,Poor Recording,"In an era when good music is usually well recorded, it is surprising and very disappointing to listen to these recordings of Beethoven overtures. The virtues (or deficiencies) of these performances are masked behind a reedy recording quality that somehow combines too much bass with too little of everything else. While the bargain price of these discs is welcome, and the performances are are pleasing, those virtues do not compensate for sub-par recording quality. Naxos and other super bargain labels provide recording quality that is almost always good and often excellent. Pro Arte needs to do a lot better."
4,Very nice,"This album pays hommage to bluegrass, country and folk...complex melodies, great musicians....a high quality, pleasing work."
3,not enough...,This book is okay but just touches the surface. keep looking if you need more details. this is fine for new converts.
1,Average,An average read by an opinionated Aussie who doesn' know that much about Africa. The book does have some funny moments and is an easy read
2,Swahili for the broken hearted,"Having lived in Africa for almost 45 years I was rather disappointed in this book. I was looking for something more ""in depth"" and soon lost interest in the story line."
5,Mark Adams is rare and worthwhile,"have had the good fortune to hear and program Asceticism from Mark Adams here at [...]. This release exemplifies all that is good about Smooth Jazz artists. He is a keyboardist without peer, and knows how to craft a song, which is a lost art in this world of cookie-cutter smooth jazz releases. This release also offers range, another sorely lacking component in contemporary Jazz today. He can be soulful and introspective, and soulful and funky. He is a protégé of the great Roy Ayers, and appears to have studied hard. He is a throw back in terms of creativity, and yet I think this release represents the future as well, where vision, spirit and melody combine to create a record truly worth owning, and hearing often."
4,A talented new jazz player,"I think that this CD is an extremely good purchase. I have listened to it several times, and never seem to tire of it. He has a truly unique and beautiful style. I particularly love the smoky sweetness Asceticism and it is a worthy CD of your attention and will provide you hours of listening pleasure. I'm sure we'll be hearing much more from him in the years to come."
3,Pretty Good Disc,"this CD has a Nice Mellow feel.Very Laid-Back.I hear a Influence of Chic Corea,among others in His Stuff.this Album Reminds me of when George Benson was starting too turn the Corner with Balancing Pop&JAzz Albums.I Like His Playing&Fusion Vibe time will what else He has in store.keep a Ear open too His Stuff."
1,S & H Highway Robbery,"I bought a $12.99 meter, maybe the size of a tangerine and they charged me $16.99 for S&H, how to screw the public,, I will never buy from Tradevar again, I would rate them a minus.... by the way, the gauge weighs 1.0 lbs."
3,Too Fluffy,"If you're looking for a technical discussion of IBM's autonomic computing initiative, this isn't it. Rather, this volume is primarily fluffy stuff suitable for a marketing presentation to upper management.A far better source of information on autonomic computing is the IBM website. It has much broader and more detailed technical content. (For readers who actually do need fluffy marketing material on autonomic computing, the website has that, too. So, it's not clear to me what audience Murch's book is supposed to serve. Upper managers without web browsers, I suppose...)"
5,It is still a good book,I think I have just made my point that certain Amazon reviewers are more interested in minor errors than book content. My recommendation to the previous reviewer is to look for employment as a book copy editor. What a waste of time and energy. I had no idea that reviews had turned into a chat forum.I stand by my original review that this is a good book and an excellent overall assessment of autonomic computing - with or without the minor errors.
3,"Reply to: Molly S. Macqueen ""brook lynn""","""does anyone know the rap song featured during the party scene at cady's house when aaron/regina walk in?""I have not seen the film or heard the soundtrack so that's the reason why I have given it a 3 star rating (middle choice)... But I do know that the song you are after is called ""Fire"" by Joe Budden feat. Busta RhymesHope this helps!"
3,Looking for song...,"I bought this soundtrack for one song only and it wasn't even on there! Does anyone know what song is playing when Aaron and Cady dance near the end of the movie. He gives her a gift certificate, the song starts playing and she's like ""I know this song"". Thanks!"
3,buy it for BUILT THIS WAY by SAMANTHA RONSON,"BUILT THIS WAY by SAMANTHA RONSON is a captivating song, you can hear it 100 times in a row. I think is the guitar... Anyway, this is a great, great song and it seem that the only way to get it (legally) in CD is buying this soundtrack. The soundtrack is not that bad, I mean you won't get a song as good and magical like Built This Ways but it has some other interesting and lift up songs. It's a crime they didn't include Love Theme by Love Unlimited Orchestra (Barry White) that sounds the first time Cady saw the guy (I forgot his name) she fell in love with. It could have been a great opportunity to maybe gain interest in knowing more about Barry White music. Buying this soundtrack for just this song is a minor sin in comparison with buying the There's Something About Mary soundtrack just for ""Mary's Prayer"" song..."
2,Meh.,"I am thankful for one thing: Lohan didn't attempt to make any tracks for this one.If you liked the movie, you might find the soundtrack fun at first...but all in all it's pretty much a mess of songs that relate to nasty girls and stereotypical ""teen pop songs"".The songs sound better in the movie than on this CD. ""Built This Way"" is a solid, nice song...but when you mix that with X-rated rapper Peaches' ""Operate"", you end up confused.At least, I was."
3,Question??????????????????,Does anyone know what the closing song on the movie was??? You know the techno enigma type of song?????? Please respond.........
2,party song,does anyone know the rap song featured during the party scene at cady's house when aaron/regina walk in?thanks.
2,Jessica seeking song...,"The song that you're looking for IS on the soundtrack. It's Samantha Ronson's ""Built This Way."" It's played several times throughout the movie. Once when ""Cady"" is at the field (when she waves at ""Aaron""), another when Aaron sees a picture of a younger Cady on an elephant during the party she throws at her house, and again at the dance, however, the tempo of the song has been slowed down. The uptempo version, so-called, is the version that appears on the soundtrack; perhaps its change in tempo is why you don't recognize it. It's a great song, either way."
2,not the greatest album,"alright, honestly this album is a little bit too preppy for my taste. a bit too girly too. the movie was okay. but i'm trying to figure out the one song they are playing in the scene where Lindsay is having a party in her house near the end of the movie; the one song they were playing downstairs. it's some kind of hip-hop song, and honestly, that song was the ONLY reason i bought this cd, and it sux that i didnt find that song on here."
3,Halcyon,"Frankly, I'm not a big fan of the soundtrack- fit the movie- kinda trite pop...but I was surprised Orbital was at the end of the movie.I just thought it might be useful that, yes, Halcyon is on Orbital 2 by Orbital (and a live version is on disk 2 of In Sides) BUT if you like the 'Fine day...' part of the song, then you'd probably prefer the Opus 3 song which is on their album Mind Fruit- only $10 here (Kristy Hawkshaw sang it and has worked with all the 'old school' ambient trance people- like Beth Orton nowadays)... (though Guru Mother is their better album!)"
4,magnets,"My grandson loves to play with them and tell you what each machine is. he does not use the magnetic tablet, but does like to play with them on the fridge."
4,Pretty Good and Simple Quiet Toy,"I bought this when my son was 4 to be a quiet toy for church and traveling. It is okay. It is pretty simple, just a mangnetic board with some construction pieces. It keeps his interseted for a 15 minutes or so then he needs something else. It is well made and a nice addition to a quiet toy collection."
5,"Busy hands, happy hands","This playboard is a great play-value-for-money purchase. I bought this for our son when he was 18 months old, to use on a long plane journey and subsequent vacation. He loved it, and it continues to be one of his favorite playthings. It fits well on an airplane tray and comes in handy in restaurants to keep a busy little hands happily occupied. My son also uses it as a playmat and mixes his diecast vehicles in with the magnetic ones. The magnets aren't overly strong, so do be forewarned that with a young toddler, pieces occaisionally slip off the board...this is only a concern in an airplane/restaurant, where you might leave one piece behind."
2,Magnets cheaply made,"I bought this for my nephew and he was very excited to open it. I was disappointed by how cheap the magnets were. Punching them out of the sheet I had to be careful that the top layer of the magnets didn't peel off, and they don't seem very magnetic. If you don't plan on this getting carried around a lot, then it'd be ok."
2,JSteele,"I received the kit and the parts matched up perfectly, However, if you are trying to repair 901's you will only have enough to repair one. Now I have to order another kit and if they would have listed the content count on the website I would have ordered 2 in the first place."
3,The fights were so so,"Many fighters were caught at a transitional stage in this event. The new rule, which allowed the fighters to kick and knee their opponents when they are on their all fours, really played a big factor to the upsets in this event. This rule is what made Pride as close as it can be to a ""no rule"" contest. The change gave the strikers a lot of advantage over the grapplers. However, the fights were pretty dull except for the main event."
4,Completely Knock Me Out,"Over the course of the past decade, Five-Eight have reinvented themselves again and again, transcending labels of ""alternative"", ""indie"", and ""emo"" and simply focusing on writing good music. After the arena-schlock of the overblown Gasolina LP, it's a return to form with the Good Nurse, a concept album of sorts regarding illness and recovery. The Classic Mantione Lyric count is high on this one, from ""Why do we raise the dead with every argument?"" to ""You doctor's young and he's wringing from you every last breath/His oath tonight, it seems like hypocrisy"", and new drummer Mike Rizzi adds a more complex musicianship to the band's sometimes punkish sound. A great, great album from Athens' least appreciated sons."
4,Still Rockin' After All These Years!!,"Includes the songs from the EP in this song listing along with some newer material from the band. This one kind of grows on you. I was so used to the old 77's material, but after repeated listenings it has caught my ear, and I like it! Mike's songwriting is still sometimes a bit on the edge but one can see the angle he's coming from . The production quality is 5 stars but it's the lyrical content that would make me rate this 4. If your a fan of the band, by all means get this CD! If this is the first time checking out the 77's, you might want to listen to some of the older material first. The musical content is good too, about 4.5 stars and they as always, do an excellent job there too. May they have many more releases! It's still one of my favorite bands Christian or otherwise!"
4,Collaboration,"One listen makes it clear that ""A Golden Field..."" is a more collaborative effort than anything the 77s have put out in the last decade. The liner notes confirm it, with drummer Spencer or bassist Harmon credited with music, lyrics or both on every song and head man Roe contributing to a lesser extent than in the past. This collaboration brings new stylistic territory with it, nothing extreme but still noticeable. While ""A Golden Field..."" is a solid record, it seems like a transition for the band that could bear much greater fruit on future offerings."
3,LACES ARE HORRIBLE,"Just want to let people know that the laces wear out very quickly and there is NO way to replace them! I have a pair in stone/starlight. The laces match the color scheme of the boot you purchase so you're stuck having to get generic laces once your laces fray. I contacted Columbia, searched online and replacement laces are not an option. I barely used these boots and the lace plastic tips came off and the stretch in the laces was gone after that, which made it a total nuisance! You'll be tripping over long laces once they stretch making them look old quickly. They won't look as cute anymore with some other laces. Overall the boot is warm and comfy but I just thought I'd let you know to consider the appearance down the road."
3,"Mellow, mellow, mellow",This is a great CD for those late nights when you don't want to think about or do anything but lay in bed with the lights down low and be lulled into total relaxation by a very mellow jazz quintet. The breathy tenor sax and lilting underspoken piano combine to form an elixor guaranteed to put you into a really relaxed mood!
4,"Good information, but a bit hard to read.","I thought that the content of this book was great. It presented a lot of interesting info about what makes the Catholic faith different from other Christian religions. I'm far from a theologian, but I think the type of information presented seemed to be on a good level for an average person to read.My only problem with the book is that the material is very dense. I often found myself reading a paragraph or a page two or three times to really understand the full meaning of what was being said. I have a feeling though that may be typical of such an in-depth and mysterious topic as religion. In other words, this book will probably take you longer than the 224 pages would indicate.One other note: The title describes exactly what it is, a focus on the unique aspects of Catholicism. This book is NOT a comparision of various religions in general; only how they relate to Catholicism."
5,fun with music,"This is a great skeletone c.dVery hard to find.Ahh, such great memories!Get it! You'll love it!"
3,Review,"This product is okay but lacks some features. While it does retract, you have to retract both ends at the same time from the center to get both sides to retract completely. It also doesn't have a hot sync button on it. It is more convenient to have one but you can hot sync without the button."
4,Nice product,"The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy. The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TX--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX. For some reason, the cable won't let me charge using the USB wall-charger I got for my wife's iPod, but it does charge the TX off my computer's USB port (which is a Powerbook G4--notorious for being underpowered)."
4,Good Product,Th prongs are slighty bigger than the part you push it into on the phone but it works none the less. Just keep in mind that it does not come with a hotsynch button.
1,Got wrong cable!,Bought this for a Palm TX... unpackaged in a hurry for a trip and threw the cable in my bag... ONLY to find out on the trip that they sent the wrong cable. Not happy!
5,am the worlds biggest GODSMACK FAN,this dvd was good and i thought it was funny i have just about all of godsmack merchandise but i do have all albums and concerts and posters and etc. but when i saw this i knew i had to have it and am glad i got it
2,Disappointing,"The information on consulting firms just comes from the consulting firms themselves. I found the same info on the firms' Web sites. I found the VaultReports.com book on consulting firms to be much better, since it gave insider information direct from employees. There are other good books out there, too."
1,Where's the beef?,"All of the first-hand experiences which led me to purchase this book are crammed into just nineteen pages. The remainder of the book is full of very brief summaries of a zillion consultancies most of which I had never heard of. I got one page on McKinsey, 1 1/2 pages on BCG and two pages on Bain. That works out to about $3 per useful page."
2,my review,eh its ok. wasn't what i thought it would be i thought there would be more general themes thought it was a little much for early childhood
2,Meh,"If u buy it at the store, its like half this price... pieces of characters are detailed however some pieces fall easily (depends onthe character). Good for showing off"
2,Boring,This dvd was full of lay and pray tactics. Most of the matches consisted of one person laying in the guard and doing nothing. They didn't even try submissons or the typical ground and pound. Save your money.
5,Trap or Die,I mess with this man any day of the week. This man is the best out right now to me. His second album was crazy and this one is straight fire. Make sure you but it
5,"jeezy is the truth, repping atl 4 sho","now i wasn't really a jeezy fan in the past, but this made me a believer and i wanna cop the last album. but anyway, as far as lyrics, jeezy himself says he is not a rapper but a storyteller, and i love his honestly for this. the lyrics are definitely on point and the beats are hitting 2, my favs are or course ""i luv it"", ""3am"", and ""what u talking bout"". not fo the snap music fans, some real talk on this 1"
3,GREAT PRODUCTION....NO NEW CONCEPTS,"I love jeezy's swagg, delivery, & beats, but for some reason this album will become annoying after continuously listening to him rap. Maybe it's just me."
2,Jeezy is so overated,"After mixtape after mixtape, and a strong first album, i was ready to rip off the plastic and dive into some trap music. i was really saddened to hear this cd. it is really just basic, how come he puts all his effort into a mixtape instead of an offical release i guess we will never know."
2,What Happened,"Im sorry but Yung Jeezy has felling off...I dont know what happend i was sleepin Jeezy's first album once i asctually listend to it i was like this do got lyrics but not that i've herd his 2nd album (which sound almost exactly like his first) i see he has lost his lyrics its a shame he WAS a great lyricist now he sucks I dont even suggest u by this worthless album unless u like to here dudes rap about drugs and have sorry lyrics only 2 good songs on here are: J.E.E.Z.Y, and Go Getta (only bcuz R.Kelly was on it) i mean yea he spits about reel stuff but he doesnt do it well his first album was way better this one will soon be forgotten"
3,Inspiration slips...,"I had high expectations for this album after buying his first album(TM101), but the hooks and lyrics slipped tragically compared to his last album. His vocabulary is limited and he's very short minded using and reusing rhymes, his punch lines are really weak. You can tell he ran out of stuff to write about. The only thing that saves this album is the bangin beats."
5,he keeps it gangsta and you luv it,"The inspiration was definitley different from tm101but its still so good.every track has a banging beat.and its great to bump to when you're driving.he talks about everything in his life.about his mom addicted to drugs and his hustle.its just an overall great cd.the intro hypnotize has by far the best beat.and the song dreamin with keyshia cole is tight.also his track with r. kelly.j.e.e.z.y is one of my favorite tracks too.bury me a G is a straight up classic.every track has a story to tell, so you all better buy this album. one of the best of the year fo sho.and if you don't like it at first, it will definitley grow on you.the beats are dopeeeee."
3,DECENT WORK,"ITS NOT A BAD ALBUM. IT HAS VERY GOOD BEATS AND JEEZY'S FLOW IS VERY NICE. BUT HE LACKS CREATIVITY IN LYRICS. THE ONLY GOOD LYRICAL TRACK ON THE ALBUM IS ""BURY ME A G""."
4,Can't every rapper sound like Rakim,Overall I feel like Jeezy just need to expand his topics and he would have had a classic. I like the effort he put in trying to expand his topic with songs like bury me a G's. I'm going to keep it real like Nas said Hip-Hop is dead u can be as lyrical as Weezy or as real as Jeezy what it come down to this generation have really nothing to rap about. There'a no L.A. riots or in your face depression leaving rappers topic at time really thin. Are soul is dead we became what we have has hated us for years. Back to Jeezy this album is pretty solid he remind me of Master P. P wasn't the most lyrical but was one hell of a song writer just great entertainment. So homie enjoy the music stop being on this lyrical quest knod your and relax. Peace
4,I Got the Streets on Lock Atlanta on my Back,"I do it for the hood, you gotta problem with that???Hahhhahh"
2,not a good sophmore effort,There are some cuts that are pretty good but doesn't live up to my expections - i would much rather listen to Thug Motivation 101
2,Young Who?,"... What can I say? 2 stars cause he has room for improvement, as a person. He's still, um, young."
3,y'all aint realized it yet?,"different folks like different music...if u like jeezy, then this one go hard, but not as hard as Thug Motivation. if u dont like jeezy, u prolly gon hate on him like these other mufuccas. if u dont like an artist, why take time out ur busy schedule to write a bad review no one cares about???Top 3--The Inspiration (Follow Me)Still On ItHypnotize"
1,Change the J in Jeezy to 'W'...............,"Young Weezy ( W for WACK!) Dude rhyme like pre-school, a step before basic education. It has nothing to do with him being from the south for me either. Scarface,Pimp C, Outkast( back in the day) Luda, just to name some, should be outraged. Put dude in the cipher with some verbalist and they will treat this stud like a punk behind bars. But he is getting paid though. This is what the industry accepts, and he is taking advantage. I must admit"
5,4.5 from me Jeezy!,It's not better than his 1st or 3rd albums but it's still dope. If your a Jeezy fan you know what your going to get when you buy his albums. Your gonna get that raw uncut gangsta street cain selling rap. If you can't swollow that don't buy.
1,Reason Why Hip-Hop is Dying....,"Let's explore Young Jeezy and ask a few questions.Can Jeezy spit 16 bars that rhyme? NOCan Jeezy distinguish between a verse and a hook? NODoes Jeezy explore other topics other than trapping, pimping, and killing? NOHas Jeezy ever killed anybody? NODoes your little sister or brother rap better than Jeezy? YESCan Jeezy battle with Nas/Jay-Z/Eminem and win? NOCan Jeezy battle a brick an win? NODoes Jeezy provide a negative influence for kids? YESWill Jeezy ever be a legend? NO. There are far better artist in the South."
1,young Jeezy is a JOKE,"I got half way through the album and cut it off. This man cannot rap, his style would put you to sleep and his lyrics are basic like a fools brain. Dont waste your time with this garbage cd if you know what good for you cause if this guy thinks he the best thing out. HipHOP is dead cause of people like this guy."
3,Real disappointment. Book filled with black & white photos.,"Santa Fe decorating style is an inviting decor which overlaps several regions with warmth and a comfort feeling. Although this book, SANTA FE STYLE, has an inviting cover and beautiful color photographs, it is filled with black and white photos of interiors as well...too many for the cost of this book. Overall has a ""dated"" look to it, oversized fonts and poor use of white space, and photos are often lost in the center bindings...all a major distraction to this book. Consider Mexican Country Style by Witnyski & Carr."
3,Perspective ethnostylistical historical than architectural,"Expected far more architectural and design illustrations from this book. It is 70% concerned with cultural interior design, furnishings and decoration. Only a small chapter devoted to the ""Santa Fe Style home."" It is a high quality book but not at all what I was looking for."
2,"Limited in depiction of ""sniper experience""","The history of sniping provided is the usual standard stuff; like most books, this book begins its account from the American Revolution, continuing through the American Civil War and the World Wars to approximately the last decade, although ""stalk and kill - the sniper experience"" goes a long way back before that and should include the use of weapons other than firearms. In depicting post-World War 2 sniping, the author limits himself to theaters in which the British had influence (Falklands, Korea, Yemen etc) and the experiences of the British Army, various English mercenaries, and the SAS. He fails to discuss ""the sniper experience"" of Russia's wars, or the Caucasus, Africa, or the Middle East. While the book's best focus is on the First World War, it does not particularly shine even in portraying that theater. Overall a lackluster book of fairly limited scope."
4,Fascinating magical realism,"Mogador is a Latin American novel set in an imaginary city (Mogador) that belongs in North Africa - complete with an Islamic or Mozarabic culture. It is a tale of sensual self-awareness of a young woman in a cloistered environment. Sanchez's sensual awareness and the ability to convert that awareness into words is sufficient justification to read the book. As a bonus, one does become interested in the young woman (Fatima) as well."
3,I liked it,"I always enjoy stories where there is already a close friendship between the two main characters. Melanie and Caleb had been friends since childhood. Their friendship grew into a man and woman kind of love. Melanie's parents were idiots and didn't deserve so much thought during the story. Caleb was an honest caring person that didn't run around chasing other women. Melanie was a little clueless for a while about her feelings, but made it through. Good read."
1,Moving on to something worthwhile...,This was a horrible book. I had to skim it just to get through. The writing was awful. I had an inclination something was up when the letter from the editor had several typos in it!! Ugh. Caleb is a pretty good guy but Melanie was a flake! The dialogue was poor and the story took some bizarre and unbelievable turns. This was so amateurish I can't believe she has had so many books published. Save yourself the money and move on to something else worthwhile.
2,So-so,"If you are a journalist or non-fiction writer, this book is good. If you are a cretive writer of short stories, novels, etc. not so much. ALL of his examples target non-fiction."
5,The very best of Music,I bought this tape on a trip to Nepal. It simply blows ones mind listening to the soothing melodies. Winter in austria is according to me the most perfectly composed pieces in this totally absorbing album. a must for all LS fans. Nothing can beat this!!!!
5,"Always Five Stars, Always Dr L Subramaniam","It would be very hard for me to rate any album of Dr Subramaniam's, or his brother L Shankar's, less than 5 stars. This one is so varied in its elements of world music, that you get a free ride for free, around the world. Fifteen dollars is peanuts for musical ecstasy!"
4,A very good story,"I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is not a great piece of literature that will become a classic. But it is a wonderful story about someone who has triumphed and experienced the greatest tradgedies. It is written so that it feels like you are having a conversation with the author. I am also glad that the author writes how he speaks. He is showing that our generation has a little bit of style and knows how to have fun while still being responsible. For any NASCAR fan this book is wonderful. For all of those out there who aren't, get this book anyway!"
2,Overrated- Only for adult readers,"I bought this book on the previous reviews. However I was sadly disapointed. One needs to read this book with White-out in hand to cover all the profainity that is in the text. Also, As a fan of NASCAR, I do not think they are all Choir Boys, But JR. writes as much about parties and drinking as racing. Their sure is a lot more to life than Drinking, Partying and getting drunk."
5,Driver #8 is GREAT!,"Driver #8 is a well written, hard to put down book! I found it to be very entertaining and recommend it highly to all NASCAR fans!"
4,More than just a race car driver,"I became a somewhat fan of Dale Jr in his rookie season, so this book was a boon to me. I read all of Dale Jr's Nascar insights before ever knowing that he had written a book, and was impressed by his ability to convey emotions and humor in his writing. Now, this book is not about sappy emotion by any means. Dale Jr seems to write just as he seems to live. He's a young man with much potential. He loves to party, flirt, and drink with his buddies. But he seems so down-to-earth in his telling of it, that you can't help but get drawn in. He does a wonderful job in this book of revealing a little more about Dale Jr, the young man and race car driver, all the while dispelling everyone's notion that he is going to be a second Dale Earnhardt. He tells in this book that he is his own man in his own right, paying tribute to his dad for getting him there, but not taking over his personality."
5,I couldnt put this book down!,"I just got this book today & already finished because I couldnt put it down. If you are a TRUE NAscar & Dale Jr. fan , this book is a must! He brings you back to his rookie season , in the Winston cup series,in such a way that he makes you feel like your in ""good ole #8"" right along with him.He not only tells you about the race & things that went wrong with his car but also tells you how he felt personally about each race. I always thought from seeing Jr.in interviews that he seemed like a normal down to earth great guy. Now I KNOW that he is. His personality Shines brightly throughtout this book!"
5,Fun read,"This book is written in the first person, and it's sort of a diary of Dale Earnhardt Jr's 2000 Winston Cup season. It's funny, articulate, thoughtful and informative. I was really surprised at how well written it was. I know Jade Gurss helped write the book, but it really came out sounding authentic and true to how Junior presents himself. I highly recommend this for the diehard NASCAR fan as well as the novice...and watch out for motorized barstools. You'll see what I mean..."
5,A Book You Cannot Put Down!,"This book is a must if you're a NASCAR fan! Dale Jr. writes about his 2000 rookie season, his lifestyle and, of course, girls. There is parts of the book where you laugh your head off and parts where you wonder what in the world is going through his mind. He talks about his father which is very sweet. When his father tells him something or advice, you can read it going through Jr.'s ear and out the other and later he relizes he should of listen to his father. I finished this book within a week and I enjoyed it alot!"
5,Who knew he could not only drive but WRITE?!?,"Amazing. Simply the best book I've ever read. I may be bias because Junior is my favorite driver... but I think this book is fantastic. It takes you into his life- his real life. Hes not afraid to hold back, and thats what makes the book-and him- so great. One of the best parts is when in one paragraph his mouthing off to someone or swearing at something and then in the next he tells about going and buying a kitten and how he just had to have it. If you are a NASCAR fan- get it. If you are a Junior fan.... get it sooner! #8 in 2003 baby!"
4,Just a regular guy,"When I finished this book, I was left thinking...here is a regular guy - under enormous pressure - doing amazing things! This is a great read - not just for the Dale Jr. fans but for any Nascar fan! Move over #20......#8 will be THE man in 2003."
5,The Perfect Book,"As a NASCAR fan, I picked the book up because I like reading bios of my favorite athletes. But this is a story of a rookie in Winston Cup, told by Dale himself. The writing is very personal, he's not afraid to curse or say he wasn't upset when the Bud Girls ""forgot"" to wear bras to a photo shoot. It's the perfect book to read to get inside the season of one of the most popular drivers in Cup!"
5,GO JR!,"I bought this book for my husband and he just loved it. What a great story about his rookie year. It was great fun to read. Jr shows his wit, candor and honesty. He tells it like it is. It is a view behind the scenes of NASCAR. He explains what it's like to be a driver in the greatest sport and a son of a racing legend."
3,New Sermon Outlines : Romans to Revelation,This is a great resource for anyone who has a heart to teach.
3,Less than Meets the Eye,"Narcissism never had it so good. The personal pronoun is overdone even though this is an autobiography. This book lacks context in almost every instance. Years from now, many readers will remember that Mary Wells and Harding Lawrence had a grand time living on the French Riviera and the Caribbean. They won't have more than a clue how the couple worked together on Braniff (which went bankrupt), or how Mary came to claim and reclaim the Continental Airlines account (bankrupt a couple of times) or felt about a client with little chances for long-term success, American Motors (bought-out before it could go bankrupt). (See the pattern here?) The writing is sometimes a twisted jumble -- one can almost envision the author speaking into a tape recorder as she ""wrote"" this book. If you're inclined to get this volume, a used paperback will suffice."
2,Really not that great,Unless you are an advertising industry buff or somehow admire Mary Wells Lawrence this book is just average. There are a few interesting spots but for the most part she is just talking herself up.
4,For old ad guys and gals,"This is indeed a poorly written book, but it does share the insight of a great icon of the 70s and 80s ad game. For those who were/are in advertising, the perspective Lawrence gives is fun to remember when people and personalities really made a difference. An easy read, a few insights but really like reminiscing with a colleague about the ""good old days."" Lots of us would have loved to have just one of those tales to tell. The other reviews I've read on Amazon are pretty accurate. Reader beware."
1,solar rock lights,They look good in landscaping but 2 were broken when I received them but it was more expensive to mail them back then throw them away. I am using the other 2 but they are so dim that they are ineffective.
2,solar rock,The rock does not give out the light I expected. I had to place it close to what I was illuminating and it barely reflects on it.
1,Way too dim!,"I bought this light to accent a feature in my garden. The solar panel received about 6hrs per day in direct sunlight, but was just to dim for the effect that I wanted. I ended up returning it."
3,rock light,Very low light could stand to be a little brighter.But if you are not looking to light up a specific area then they work great.
1,A RIP OFF!!!,"There's nothing new in this DVD, just old recycled footage of every playmate that appears on there. Don't waste your money on this one...... I swear it ought to be against the law to rip people off by putting nothing but old footage on these so called ""new"" playboy movies."
3,"not original, but a good compilation","The DVD ""PRIME TIME PLAYMATES"" is a good choice of previous segments featuring famous playmates.Buy this DVD if you want a overview of a lot of the best playmates."
4,Random Funk/Hip-Hop mix tape,"I checked this one out after getting way into The Funky 16 Corners, which is a great mix of old-school funk tracks that most of us have never heard of.This is not the same as that, but you can easily tell that some of the same people put it together. This does have some great old-school funk tracks, but it has more eclectic hip-hop that I can't put a specific genre on. Some of it's kind of out there. Like an instrumental cover of Stevie Wonder's ""I am Singing,"" done with what sounds like a kid's keyboard. I don't love the whole thing, but there are some great tracks that you probably won't hear anywhere else, and it does make a great companion to ""16 Corners."""
2,Bad for plastic,"This is a good car wax but I made the mistake to use it on the 3M Clear Plastic bra. Even though it says it is safe for plastic, it cracked the 3M Clear Plastic bra and it looks awful. Biggest mistake ever! It looks like a cat scratched it all over the place. My beautiful car now looks ugly."
5,GIVE YOUR CAR SOME KLASSE!,"After weeks of online research, I decided to try Klasse All-in-One on my 2008 4runner. I had been using another brand of sealant since buying the vehicle three years ago. Now that the truck is ""getting older,"" I wanted to ensure the paint continues to look great.Here's my surface prep--(1) wash the vehicle well, (2) dry the vehicle using microfiber towels, (3) apply the sealant in the shade and (4) remove surface impurities with clay [I HIGHLY recommend the Pinnacle-brand clay].I applied the All-in-One by hand with a microfiber applicator. It is very easy to apply and easy to remove. I am very impressed with the All-in-One and don't think I will use anything else...I purchased a polisher and cannot wait until my pads come in to use the product for my second coat over Labor Day!The product goes a long way--I didn't use much at all. If you don't try it, you really don't know what you are missing."
5,Works on paint AND glass,"I used tis product to clean the small particles off my car's finish. The paint went from having a rough feel to feeling smooth again. I found Klasse easy to apply and easy to hand-buff off. It removed tar, bugs, and yellow residue left by tree sap. All the washing in the world wouldn't have taken that stuff off. It is non-abrasive, but works well.I also used it to clean the same residue from my sunroof and windows. It made the glass look new, and took all the particles off. I used All-in-one to prepare my car for a coat of Klasse polish, which works as a great combination, and is well-worth the money. I live in a dusty area, and I can already tell that the product's anti-static claim is working on the car's finish and windows.Klasse All-in-one could be used as a stand-alone product, because the car looked great after the application, but after using the Klasse Polish as my second coat, it looks even better."
5,"Nice, easy to apply, versatile","I agree with the other reviews, Klasse AIO seems to be a great product for this first-timer. Granted, I used this on a white pearl which is pretty foolproof, but it was easy to use. After using the AIO, I used the sealant. The sealant is trickier and the key seems to be the application. It would seem that it makes sense to mix-and-match brands/products for the best success rate. I'd buy and use Klasse AIO again. Unsure if I'd say the same about the sealant though!"
2,Palmbeach clearing out old inventory,"I received a 6 year old bottle of this ""all-in-one"" polish. They replied telling me that thier polish is good for 10 years... so to them it's all good. The polish is average... about the same as ""NuFinish"". It does absolutely nothing for oxidized paint as the spot on the roof of my car looks exactly the same as before using this product. This polish will provide about the same shine as any polish or wax that you can get in any store."
1,Way over hyped & not worth the money,"Klasse is very expensive and way way over hyped by car enthusiasts. The plus is that it goes on very easily. I live in a northern climate and use NuFinish for most of the year and bought this to clean the car's surface once a year in the spring. Its protection will last from about a week to roughly three months depending upon what contaminants get on your car in the interim. Klasse does a mediocre job of cleaning your surface, which is what I bought the product for. No wax or polish lasts as long as the manufacturers claim. I liked it in the old days when you could buy separate cleaners and waxes, but those are hard to find now a days. I'm still looking for a good cleaner. NuFinish paste is the best I found for lasting. Depending upon the winter I get 6-7 months, which is the best by far I've ever gotten out of any wax or polish."
3,hmmm,"I rented this movie having no idea what it was about, i needed to get three movies and just grabbed this one. I love foreign movies, and thought it would be interesting to see a Russian one. I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, it seemed to be good, I liked that it was in black and white. However I didn't feel there was enough plot, or that enough was being told. The ending made be rethink the whole movie, which I thought was great. It was quite interesting to see a movie so different than what's out today."
5,"""WOA! is really the only word I need. This is GREAT!"",","WOA! is the only word I need. This is GREAT! I am really amazed that this has not been published before now. It does not read like five or six Bond books, but so what if it did? Ian Fleming wrote a great story and had people turning pages. This was extremely gripping and at times I wanted to turn away, but couldn't. Great work!"
5,The BEST Maple Syrup,I love this spectacular syrup. High quality and full of flavor! Not to mention organic. I have enjoyed their products for over twenty years. Perfect on pancakes and in desserts.
5,"Great stuff, good for you and nice bottle too!","Real maple syrup!!! Fantastic, and so good for the body. Nice feature of this syrup is the dripless flip-top spout on their bottle. Would get it again."
4,Nice and sweet!,"It's maple syrup! Simple and sweet, what else do you need to know? It's a little pricey, I can get about 12 ounces more for less money at Costco. But other than that, pour it on!"
2,This novel should be subducted,"Nance's earlier books weren't bad. The aviation portion of this book seems in order. But his fanciful writing about earthquakes leaves much to be desired. He's learned the various terms from a seismologist, but the terms should be put together with some attention to reality. Earthquake prediction is not a science, as yet; but the author seems to indicate otherwise. As a techno thriller, it's better terms as fantasy.If you borrow this from your local library, but buying it at any cost is spending too much money."
1,Worst. Nance. Novel. Ever.,"Repetitive, bland dialogue and unsympathetic, inconsistent characters are the hallmark of this book. The plotline seemed kind of pointless, and, well, boring.One thing that bugged me initially - in the first 20 or so pages of the book - was that he identified a bit character as a San Francisco police ""detective,"" when in fact people so employed in the SFPD are given the title ""Inspector,"" NOT detective. Is it too much to expect a certain attention to detail and accuracy from such a well published author? If he got that detail wrong, how much of the rest of the technical details in the novel are so far off.Reading this book was a real drag; I think Mr. Nance should stick to airplane disaster novels."
2,One of the rare novels I gave up on...,"The book is 352 pages. Before I reached page 100, I gave up on this one. It seemed padded, awkward, unrealistic in dialogue and characters. I had grabbed it off the library shelf after reading a rave review in a newspaper. I should have checked Amazon first, because the negative (or at least unenthusiastic) critiques here seem to be the truth. I have not read any of the prior books by Nance, but those seemed to be liked better by the reviewers. I'm disappointed, but glad I did not buy the book. Better luck next time, Mr. Nance."
4,Entertaining,I found this novel to be entertaining. It's a nice change that John J. Nance doesn't write yet another air disaster but keeps it on the ground instead. Nance is a very skilled writer with a narrative that puts you in the middle of the story. A fast and sometimes emotional story that kept me entertained.Recommended
2,His worst Novel that I have read,"Nance is number one on my list of favorite authors but this novel is sub-par for him. First it is not an aviation thriller by any stretch, very little excitement, only one surprise, no fixed wing aircraft, and a nothing ending. I could go on and on but I think this short comment says it all!"
2,The good old days (sigh!),"There was a time when John J. Nance was THE best at writing, scary and all too possible air flight disaster thrillers.Apparently, the good old days are gone. If you are expecting this book to be about disasters in the air (in the same style as the wonderful Medusa's Child) - you will be sorely disappointed.This *thriller* is set mainly on the island of Cascadia. Think Club Med - owned by a man who will do about anything for money. Of course, things are not what they seem and all kinds of weird natural disasters are going to happen to Cascadia.Apparently airline disaster plots are no longer to be.Sounds promising? - its not.This book is long winded and none of the characters are particularly believeable. The plot is full of holes and frankly, the whole thing bored me.I wish Nance would go back to writing airline thrillers. Until then, I will no longer be a reader."
2,RICK WAKEMAN ONLY ON SOUNDTRACK...,"THOUGH I HAVEN'T WATCHED THE DVD(I ORDERED IT BY MISTAKE AND SENT IT BACK UNOPENED AFTER FINDING OUT WHAT IT WAS),READER BE FOREWARNED THIS IS A MOVIE WITH ACTORS AND SUCH AND RICK ONLY DOES A BIT OF THE SOUNDTRACK.SINCE THERE IS LITTLE ITEM DESCRIPTION ONE CAN EASILY ASSUME IT IS RICK DOING A SOLO CONCERT ALONE ON HIS PIANO.NOT SO.I HAD TO RATE IT SOME STARS BUT MY 2 STARS MEANS NOTHING.I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN IT."
2,"Hummingbird House, hard to believe","Not very well written. Love story is not believable; although the ending was, unfortunately, believable, it would have been much better without the ""years later"" epilog."
2,Depressing,"This book was not at all what I was expecting. I did not connect with the main character (or even find her to be likeable). After reading half way through the book - which was mainly a collection of depressing scenes and flashbacks with some distasteful sexual references thrown in - I gave up reading. I was hoping for an inspirational plot turn or some hope to enter into the storyline, and I got tired of waiting..."
2,"Lovely writing, but can't connect w character","Like others, I expected to love this book. The writing is gorgeous -- perhaps distractingly so -- and I read it while traveling in Guatemala. Read the first 2/3, but finally gave up on the main character, the former midwife who spends the middle of the book waiting.....not delivering babies, not doing the very things we're told she believes in, but waiting, making phone calls, moping around. That's the problem with so much literary fiction: Not enough happens, and/or the characters are exquisitely drawn with lovely language, but don't have heart. I didn't care enough about any of the characters to keep reading. But lovely prose, no doubt about that."
1,Water in battery compartment,This product was fabulous for the first 4 months. Then I got water in the battery compartment and it stopped working. I am very upset.
5,LOVE THIS THING!,"My children bought me this for my birthday last year. We love it! It is the best for mixing chocolate milk, powder or liquid, mixes up nice with no sedament on the bottom of the glass. I use it for coffee, froth up the warm milk first and add the coffee, yum! The one thing it won't mix are eggs. They are too thick. Otherwise, we use this about 5 times a week. A wonderful little gadget for the kitchen."
5,Froth your milk in seconds,"I just love this little gadget, heat up your milk and then use the whip to froth it, basically done in 10 seconds.So easy to clean and use... A must have for all you latte/capuccino lovers."
5,Great Little Tool,"Boy, I was really impressed with how fast this little thing whipps the milk, In a matter of seconds I can have the milk frothed - and that without the steam or espresso machine. Very Cool and Useful tool. I strongly recommend it - should be in every kitchen. And it's so easy to wash, just rinse in the sink for a second and it's good to go. I love it!!!"
5,MUCH MORE THAN $20 WORTH OF FUN,"I have never taken the time to actually write a review for a purchase, although I have made many very nice ones from Amazon. This little gizmo, though, takes the cake. I have had more fun whipping up delicious lattes for myself in the last three days than you can imagine. And with a good blend of coffee and good milk, they are better than any you'll buy. It is very (too ! lol) easy to use. I have a kitchen full of lots of equipment, but this is without a doubt the best $20 I have ever spent."
4,"risk everything, risk everything!","In this documentary,you learn about HIM,his way of being,of working which are so closely bound.The title says it all,Cassavettes used to risk everything on a set,to express all human feelings,from love to hate.It's always a pleasure to hear(about)him,so charismatic and moving,just as much as those testimonies by Gena,Nick and all those people we know so well.The video could be a little longuer but it's worth it! ENJOY."
1,"An amateur prank, if not a scam...","For all serious film buffs and film professionals out there-though I command the filmmaker's devotion to and reverence of John Cassavetes - whom I myself admire, respect and keep on learning from - the best that the author of ""John Cassavetes: To Risk Everything to Express it All"" could've done (to honor the memory and the cultural heritage of J. Cassavetes) is to never release this amateurish, studentish, poorly crafted, highly unoriginal video reportage. I find it disrespectful toward the memory of the great man. The self-proclaimed ""Fascinating portrait ..."" smells nothing short of shameful exploitation. It is equally sad the the ""admirer"" of J. Cassevetes happens to be completely blind as to not being able to see the degree of mediocrity of his effort. Perhaps, next time around, the author of the above work should rewatch the films of J. Cassavetes prior to releasing his ""home"" video efforts."
5,Tossers and all their music,"I went to a Tossers show last night and it kicked. The band was awesome and they stuck around and jammed with us until 3 am [eventhough the show ended at 12 and the had to drive to San Jose]. They played almost all of their tunes and Long Dim Road has some of the best. I've looked for their other albums but cant find them anywhere. But if you like a mixture of Irish folk music and punk, you will love the Tossers."
4,Great album but not typical,"For whatever reason the Tossers decided to rock out more on this album, and in a punk fashion no less. They are so good at it you would think that is what they always do, but if you listen to their other stuff they are more of an Irish hillbilly band with drums. So enjoy this album but don't expect the same from the other albums, they are much more folky. The rumor is that the singer is American and kind of puts on an Irish accent, but if you think about it a lot of British singers sound American when they sing so maybe this is the reverse effect."
5,buy it,"It is an awsome album. I never gave much thought to my Irish ancestery, but after I heard this album I started reading alot about Irish history and it has enriched my life quite a bit. I flew out and saw them play at sxsw in Austin, and I enjoyed the show quite a bit!!!(although there were only about 10 people at the bar) I'm looking forward to maybe flying out to see them play in Chicago or something. Anyway, I have first league out from land, long dim road, and communication and conviction, and they are all good and worth buying!!!!"
3,Good effort by Punk/Irish band,"The Tossers play Irish music like many of the recent ska/punk outfits play ska. That is, it's heavy on the punk while relying on the basic tennents of the traditional music. In their case ska, in this case traditional Irish music. Think of them as a much faster, less lyrically astute, more political Pogues. It's fun, and the lyrics give you something to think about, (though they rarely move beyond standard anti-cop/goverment/etc. punk sloganeering). They play traditional Irish instruments faster than anyone I've ever heard. Overall, Long Dim Raod is a fine effort with an interesting take on punk/Irish originated and popularized by the Pogues. Fans of both the Pogues/Popes and bands like Swingin' Utters/Dropkick Murphys will enjoy this release."
4,Poster is slightly diff than pictured.,"Just like the other reviewer said, this poster is not the same as the one pictured. It's only slightly different though, and I'm very happy with it! It shipped very fast and arrived in perfect condition. Poster Revolution should change the product picture to avoid any future confusion."
5,"Comprehensive, intuitive, clear and easy to follow",A very comprehensive coverage of Microeconomics with reasonable mathematical rigour.Each topic is covered in depth with proofs that are clear and easy to follow. This text is able to overcome the main limitations of the Varian book and provides a much more in depth coverage of the topics with a much better mathematical exposition.Another notable feature is the focus on intuitive reasoning which is sometimes lacking in other econ texts.Given the choice of 1 book on Micro-economics this would be it.
3,It's good for mathematically included.,"I read this book as it's one of set books for my MSc course, it tries to cover a lot information but without enough explaination. By the way, this book may satisfy those mathematically included, but those without strong mathematics background may find it's difficult to read."
3,Smaller than I imagined and a small defect,"The fountain was less impressive in person. I imagined it would be taller, and question if it's really 15"", it seems a bit less.It has been working fine except one part of the tube has come loose and it's slightly difficult to fix. Otherwise, I'd recommend if it you want a small fountain. It's very quiet, maybe TOO quiet. :)"
2,Barbie doll,What can I say. A Barbie doll is a Barbie doll. Not my fave but my grand kids love them. This doll and the packaging were in great shape and brand new. Arrived when promised.
3,Ehh.. I thought she would be better.,"Maybe I'm biased. I don't know. ... Upclose, her forehead looks too large. Really. It does. I'm an avid Barbie collector and I take time in considering my Barbie purchases, but I have to admit that this was a bad buy. I returned her right away. She's nice enough I guess, but a bit too plain. Her helmet has no designs on it. The other barbies (even the African American Barbie is nicer) have cool flame designs on their helmets. Hers is just plain black. She's a bit too plain for me, but I guess people will buy her to complete their Harley Davidson collection. ^_^;"
5,Hard to find,Giorgio V.I.P.was a hit in the 80's. They stopped making it in the early 90's. Exceptional fragrance. This foam takes very little to do the job. It smells just like the cologne and lasts a long time.
3,I must be missing something,"Kieran Egan's account of building his backyard garden unfolds in what feels like real time. There are the painstakingly detailed accounts of the crooked fence, driving to the store to buy pond liner, and moving a large rock followed by sections on ""putting in the support posts,"" and ""laying the pavers."" Building My Zen Garden is neither a how-to book nor a meditation on process. It's more like a collection of journal entries that are perhaps too long and too dry for my tastes. And while there's a part of me that is happy to see an academic take on a project with so little self-consciousness, another part of me is annoyed that Egan reduces the sophistication of Japanese aesthetics to a series of anecdotes about a backyard project."
2,Wow! $750 for 14 months. Nice.,"This laptop ran pretty well and did most of the things the average user would want it to.That is, until the DC jack on the back went bad- and I let it run too long. Just found out the motherboard is fried. Nice. Less than 2 months out of warranty. Apparently this is a common problem with Toshibas.Toshiba, if you're going to try to compete with the others, BUILD A QUALITY PRODUCT!"
1,Dead after three uses,"I bought this laptop, and the third time I used it, it died. It will no longer even charge. I brought it to the repair shop and they said that it was defective. They're sending it back to Toshiba... my next computer will be a VAIO."

5,My favorite of 2002!,"Catherine Mann's Wedding at White Sands is a wonderful read. Filled with characters that are charismatic, lovable and sexy it's no wonder that this is my favorite book of 2002.I feel very lucky to have discovered her and can't wait to read her upcoming Wingmen Warriors series.So if your are craving a very satisfying book, a book that will make you laugh, cry and sigh over an enthralling plot, sizzling sexual attraction and a hero to fall in love with then make sure to run to the stores to get your copy of the highly recommended Wedding At White Sands."
3,Watchable,"Far less excruciating than the NYC 25 best dunks one from this same series. There is some pretty cool, watchable stuff here.Unfortunately, as with the dunks video, the producers/editors are WAY too in love with the instant replay, rewind, slow motioneffects. Far too many plays aren't even shown once in regular time, but three times in slow motion. It's like they don't haveenough confidence in it being cool/exciting enough on it's own, so they have to do all this effects crap. Ruins it for me."
1,Worst Streetball DVD ever!,"I don't really need to say much because the other cat who gave 1 star said it all. I don't know who made this, but I hope they go bankrupt. This DVD was so bad I think I could sue for false advertising. And the other two reviewers that gave 5 stars, have either never watched basketball or work for the distributor. And it's so funny because they'd do slow motion replays of the most average uninteresting plays. Like of someone just passing the ball. I keep wondering if this was some kind of joke. Anyways don't waste your money, you'll find it more entertaining to go and watch players at your local court."
4,Good stuff,I am a fan of many of the Aubrey products. I have used this one and like the way it absorbs quickly into the skin. For more moisture I layer the Aubrey Rosa Mosqueta Night cream over the top and the combo is great! I have very dry skin so I need all the moisture I can get. Since switching to the Aubrey line I receive compliments on my skin and how nice it looks which tells me all I need to know. The Rose Hip Seed oil by Aubrey is also a favorite of mine. Thank you Aubrey for good quality products that are not full of chemicals!
1,"Feels good, but...","I had a bad allergic reaction to it and woke up with red, itchy bumps all over my face, neck and chest. I've never reacted to a skincare product like that before. It felt good and did feel moisturizing, so it probably would work for some people, but not for me!"
5,Best natural nightime serum,"I have been searching for moisturizers and serums for my acne prone skin for years. I have a dark complexion, and I have recently noticed hyperpigmentation trying to settle in. After reading some reviews on Aubrey Organics products, I gave the nightime serum a try. Within a few days, I noticed a significant change in my skin. With this serum, a little bit goes a long way. This serum is very lightweight and leaves your skin glowing. Along with other Aubrey Organic products, I have incorporated this as a staple product in my nightly skin care. I highly recommend purchasing this product!"
3,"Nice Idea, poorly executed","I am about half way through this book and I have to say that while it is a good idea, the book is fraught with incomplete ideas and typos that have caused me significant frustration. For example, in hour 9 there is an exercise that has you saving state using a hidden form element -- which flat out doesn't work. At first I thought it was my typo, but then I tried to run the example file from the included CD, which also didn't work. AND the sample files from the CD are different (sometimes) than in the book. I have yet to get the email function working, though I have set everything up as describedin the book. And in Hour 10 the discussion of the is_executable() function completely fails to mention that it is not supported on Win32 systems.I like the step-by-step approach, but have to say that these little oversights are incredibly frustrating."
2,An advanced book & not for beginners,"I am stuck on chapters three and four and can not continue with this book. I could not get Apache to work with PHP. In the ""Troubleshooting"" section of the book on page 58 the solution to getting Apache to work is this: To solve this problem, you need to stop the running server or change the Apache configuration to listen on a different port. Well, if you know how to do this, buy the book. If you don't, you are forever suck and can't continue with the rest of the book. I tried to change the ports and address as suggested in the book, but it didn't work. Be sure to read ""Who Should Read This Book"" in the introduction section of the book. I probably don't have the required experience to work the material in this book."
4,"Questions? Please read table of contents, or ask me!","Hi - I am the author of this book, and I want to make sure everyone understands where this book comes from. It's parts of three different books, with several new chapters. It's fairly beginner-ish in nature, but you definitely have to have a handle on how the Web works, from an administrative standpoint, to get your brain around the Apache chapters. The MySQL and PHP chapters assume less pre-existing knowledge, and are pretty fun, hands-on and oriented through working through lessons.This is not the be all and end all PHP, Apache and MySQL book -- that would take way longer than 24 hours -- nor is it meant to be. But it will teach the fundamentals of all three things, and provide you with a strong foundation for more advanced books. You can find more info like table of contents, code and errata at thickbook.com.Best, Julie."
4,Excellent for beginners,"Before purchasing this book, I tried to install Apache, MySQL and PHP on my Windows machine without any luck. I was frustrated because this is all quite effortless if you use any flavor of Linux (Red Hat 9 in my case).I purchased the Dummies book on the same subject(s) and I found it confusing, particularly getting PHP to interact with Apache. I returned the book and got this one and I was up and running with Apache, MySQL and PHP in about an hour."
2,verbose and inadequate,"This book was exasperating to use. It described easy topics at length while leaving important details murky or omitted altogether. Many commmands and structures are described out of context, leaving you with little idea of *why* a person might use a particular form. It doesn't try to put the ideas together into a unified application until the end.Much better is _PHP and MySQL Web Development_ by Welling and Thomson, which introduces concepts in the context of building an e-commerce site. Even though it is longer than the SAMS book, the writing is tighter, more concise, better organized, and generally much easier to understand."
1,Not helpful,"One of the worst ""beginner"" books I've read for computer programming. The book frequently directs the reader to external web pages for critical tasks... and I'm thinking, ""Gee. I bought the book to walk me through this"". The code is poorly explained. The examples frequently didn't work. Steps are omitted.If you want to split your time between a book and online searches for manuals... this book is for you. If you want to get your $35 worth of a book and expect to have it be enough (not the end all, be all, but enough) of a beginning... go elsewhere."
5,Amazing!,What an amazing deal! My book came to me so quickly and it was in fabulous condition! Will definitely order again!
1,What You See Isn't What You Get,"I am a Spawn collector (of certain ones only) and I bought this one at a toy store. I was hesitant to buy it because the packaged toy was not the one that was pictured! Instead of the white face mask and gun it came with a sword and demon head that was cut off. Don't get me wrong, it is a great piece of work, it just wasn't the one that I was hoping to have. I have found the one with the white face mask, but decided not to buy it. I had already bought this one and didn't feel like getting another one. Who knows, I may change my mind! This toy is great for looks, but good for nothing else."
4,Increiblemente tierno & conmovedor...,En menos de dos horas llegas a conocer intimamente al artista atravez de sus videos & commentarios acerca de su letra.

4,How Star Jones's Wedding Should Have been.,"When you sign up for a free wedding, it doesn't matter if it's what you want or not. It matters what the people who are paying for it want. Though the two characters who sign up for the free weddings are judged solely on what they wear to work by their boss, they don't like what has been picked out for them. How will one survive wearing a ""Big Bird"" dress when she much prefers Elmo and how will one wear a traditional dress when she really loves the ""Big Bird"" dress.Can these two girls really say no to a free wedding? No matter what it costs. (Even if it's their dignity?)"
3,Pretty standard stuff,"This is pretty standard chick lit stuff.Melissa Senate is an entertaining writer and therefore has written a fun book. However, weddings in chick lit are so ""done"". Still, the store was fairly entertaning and the characters were your usual mixture of nice and mean.An average entry into the Red Dress Ink series."
3,"Feathers, Leather, and the Chicken Dance?","I couldn't quite give this a higher rating because I knew the plot too early. It was very predictable, but it was enjoyable and fast paced.Eloise is a graphic designer for WOW Weddings Magazine, one day her and a co-worker were discussing their engagements, when the editor, Acid, ooops I mean Astrid over hears them and gets THE IDEA! to do a spread of a modern bride and a classic bride. Eloise is chosen as the modern bride because of her artsy background and non traditional haircut.What is she supposed to do when Astrid doesn't allow her to choose what she wants for her own wedding? Purple rubber dresses? Feathers? Leather? It's a debacle from beginning to end, will Eloise find her dream along the way?Also, Eloise goes on a journey of self discovery while looking for the father who left her and her brother when she was 5. This story has a little heart, a lot of OH MY GOD, and predictability, but also was a lot of fun to read."
5,Dilon Djindji's still got the groove,"This wonderful CD captures the rhythm and energy in Dilon Djindji's music. I was lucky enough to see him perform in Maputo, Mozamabique in September 2005 and the CD captures the effortless groove of his performance - and even though he's now 78, he sings (and dances) with the energy of a man half his age. This is a must have CD for everyone into African music."
2,Like putting a square peg in a round whole,Padding creates a large square buldge that doesn't fit on ankle. Design is squared and not rounded so the holster doesn't even wrap ankle properly.
2,Nobel Prize Winner Fails to Use Spell-Check,"shocking but true. i'm a die-hard matrix fan who has read every book written on the movies. journey did have its merit -- being the only matrix book to take on the symbolic significance of explaining why the humans can talk on cell phones, but need a hard line to exit the matrix. nevertheless, something remains missing from this book: the author's pride.dr challiyil isnt taking any profit from this book, deflecting all funds to his charitable foundation. good for him. but that is no excuse for such a piss-poor presentation as rampant misspellings, irregularities in the spacing and several contradictions of the plot.it is as if he said: i'm a nobel winner. there's a big matrix audience. if i spend all of two weeks writing a pseudo book i'll make some money for my cause and do some good. who cares if it's accurate or presentable? i'll have fun and that's that.the book reads like a long blog.welcome to the desert of the spell-check."
5,a thrilling romance,this book is a must read for anyone who likes an edge of your seat thriller! i was becoming bored with romance novels since most of them have very week story lines and rely on romantic plots to cativate their readers. this book had a real story line complete with a never seen it coming twist. cynthia cooke is a genious! you have to see for yourself.
5,Thriller that WILL make you shiver,"An intriguing, fast-paced plot keeps this story moving along at a good clip. Cynthia expertly sets up the plot twists for a completely satisfying resolution of our heroine's life-long problem. A strong cast of secondary characters helps to set the mood and the scenery. A real page-turner!"
5,Great Read!,"Cynthia Cooke has done it, again. If you want a fast-paced plot with a hero and heroine with chemistry that sizzles right off the page, you've come to the right place. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Good story-poor h,I thought the story line was really great--however the h was really lame. I would have liked to have seen more of the story line and less of the weak h and her feelings repeated over and over again.
4,Medieval Spawn III,"Well... first i have to say that this is one of the better 'classic' mc farlane toy compared to the first one. It's almost exactly like the first one, which was released somewhere bout 1994 , except that this one is much more detailed and better and it has a battle axe instead of a lightning shaped sword. But i think it's better off with a sword than an axe, cause he doesn't really look like he's a pure macho bagero who is suitable for holding an axe... so i gave the axe to Tormentor from series 14 and he looks pretty good with it. Furthermore, i have bought a golden metal sword for it ... and it fits it perfectly with that realistic 'feel'. Overall, this model is satisfactory, except for it's quality. The figure is extremely fragile and nevertheless not suitable for children below age 16 because they might break everything in em."
1,"Death Sport, Death Machines -- How about Brain Death","With this kind of movie you know three things are going to happen: (1) lots of explosions, (2) naked women, (3) none of it will make sense.As mentioned by another reviewer, most of the ""action"" is seeing a bunch of motorcycles being driven around fields, rocks, and something that appears to be borrowed from a monster truck rally.The climatic swordfight has only one good choreographed move, when Moor does a nice somersault kick--too bad Oshay forgot to react. Almost the entire sword fight is filmed really close-up so you don't see them actually hitting the swords together, just swinging elbows. Of course, since the ""crystal"" swords are clear plastic, they would have broken on the first hit.If you really want to see this movie, wait until you can rent it for free at your local video store. Should you get the VHS or DVD? With a movie as lousy as this, does it really matter?"
1,Unwatchable,"This is a terrible movie. It's supposed to be some kind of semi-sequel to Death Race 2000, but it lacks all of the satire and comedy of its predecessor. It's Boring, plain and cheap. Sure, Roger Corman, the B-movie king, was known for being cheap, but this is awful. Roger Corman was also known for seeking out new directors with talent (he gave Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Penelope Spheeris their first breaks), but Henry Suso, or whoever the director was has no talent. It's not even worth watching as an exploitation film. Death Race 2000 was awesome, but I wish ""the deathsport"" died in the ""Great Neutron Wars"". The dvd is complete crap, too. No theatrical trailer,it's in 1.33:1, no interview by leonard maltin and no subtitles. One star for the packaging."
1,IF I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS I WOULD!,WTF! WTF! WTF! WHY? WHY IN GOD'S NAME IS THAT STUPID US TITLE WARLORDS OF THE 21ST CENTURY STILL THE ONSCREEN TITLE? I HAVE NEVER HAD A FILM I HAVE WAITED IN SUCH ANTICIPATION FOR THEN BATTLETRUCK. JUST THE TITLE GAVE ME THE BIGGEST RUSH I'VE EVER FELT. NOW I CAN'T EVEN WATCH IT. BECAUSE THE BUZZ WAS DESTROYED BY THAT STPID US TITLE. WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THE TIME TO RELEASE IT IF YOUR NOT GONNA DO IT RIGHT? WHY? I HATE CRAPPY TITLE AND I HATE CRAPPY ENDINGS. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS. IT'S FALSE ADVERTISING! ILLEGAL! I SHOULD PURSUE LEGAL ACTION! AND I AM THINKING ABOUT DOING SO! SOMEBODY IS GONNA MAKE THIS RIGHT!
3,See it for Claudia,"This movie is laughably bad, but every moment that Claudia Jennings is on the screen is worth watching. She gives a restrained but earnest performance, taking the role more seriously than the movie deserves. They should have made her the central character."
3,Only purchased it for Battletruck,Battletruck brought back memories of teenage movie going in NZ. More for nostalgia than anything.Deathsport is rubbish with a weak story line and wooden acting and action.
1,very cheaply made,I received this game and found it to be chipped and cracked. I returned it. They just aren't made the way they used to.
2,Disappointing to day the least.,"I was really looking forward to playing this with my boys. They love mazes and puzzles. Unfortunately, the side knob which controls the front to back movements of the marble had a bent rod which greatly hindered our ability to control the marble. So we are returning this for a refund. I just don't trust that another one will arrive in any better condition. The construction on the whole is merely so-so. They really cut corners here. Lastly the marbles are very small, easily lost or a choking hazard for younger siblings. All things considered this was a very disappointing purchase."
2,Cheap Cheap,Not the same toy we all played with as kids. The board is so poorly constructed that the ball gets stuck. You spend half you time trying to free the ball loose instead of working it through the maze. I wish someone made a good quality version of this toy. It was a lot of fun.
1,We were misled!!!,"Well, live and learn.My husband and I deliberately spent a higher price than most of the others advertised, as we were looking for high quality. (Nothing more frustrating than a labyrinth that doesn't work properly!) However, when we received the labyrinth it was immediately clear that the construction was shoddy, and that the frustration the game would cause would make the product neither educational nor fun. In addition - the picture on the web, as well as the one on the box that it came in, showed 60 holes, whereas this one has only 36.Not a way to enhance Christmas morning."
2,very poorly made,This toy was very poorly made and they sent me two when I requested one and extra set of marbles.
1,Very cheaply made,This product is not even close to the one you'll recall as a child...When I opened it I noticed it was half the size and may have well been made from balsam wood. The walls on the face look they were made by a child for a school project and glued with elmers glue. The marbles are small and dont exit the return hole without being shaken for several moments.Very disappointed.
2,Bad Quality!,"I got this for my son as I derived so much pleasure from it as a child. I was very disappointed with it indeed. This is not the Labyrinth of old - it is too flimsy and just does not work properly for that reason. I returned this and got the BRIO Labyrinth - more expensive, but it works and is exactly like the original, made by the original manufacturer - BRIO - now more famous for the wonderful and durable wooden trains. Avoid this - get the original!"
2,Misleading picture - not the real deal,The picture online shows a replica of the classic 60 hole maze. When the box arrived I knew immediately something was wrong. The box was too small and light. On the cover of the box was the same picture as on the internet. But inside the box was a very different product: a very flimsy scaled-down version of the classic with a tiny steel ball and only a 36 hole course. The ball is too small and light weight to have the steady action of the original and the 36 hole layout is a joke. I guess you need to spend a few more dollars to get something more akin to the real thing.
3,NO LIBRETTO OR SUB-TITLES - PITY,It would have been 5 Stars if a Libretto was supplied with the DVD or if it had optional sub-titles.
3,Perhaps not,"I like Poulenc's music generally, not just his operatic material. I must say, however, that I was disappointed in the staging and performance of this work. Part of my unhappiness comes from the fact that the opera was sung in English - not French. These were no sub/supertitles. As anyone knows who has tried to understand what is being sung operatically, it's virtually impossible. It certainly was the case here. And yes, I am one of those people who believe that an opera should be sung in the language in which it was composed. It has to do with the rhythm of the language and the impossibility of transmitting that rhythm to a different language. That said, if you are one of the fans of Dame Joan's glorious voice, by all means get this production."
5,Dialogues des Carmelites,"Joan is breathtaking. This opera is a beautiful and tragic story and it is wonderful to have a resource available in English.The French CD with Duval is georgous also, if you are interested in owning a recording. :)"
3,Stick with G&S if you want to understand.,The problem with opera sung in English is how difficult it is to sing clearly. There are no subtitles offered on this DVD and I couldn't understsnd even half of the words sung. That spoiled the experience badly.
3,"Good, but still not back to his old form","This CD is a bit of a comeback after the horrible ""The Day the Laughter Died, Part II."" That album was released seven years ago. It seemed as if Dice had lost his touch. This is a good album that has funny and unfunny moments. On the whole, however, this is a quality effort. Unfortunately, most of his fans have quit on him. But the faithful are rewarded with unbelievable moments that tickle your funny bone to death with a new style, including the portions in which he discusses farmers and going to the movies. I don't like the cover, however. I think it's tacky, and it says to the audience that this artist is washed up and the only way they'll buy this is if naked girls are pictured on the cover (like a 1998 2 Live Crew album)."
1,poor,"Don't be fooled by the title. This is not what it seems. My guess, Dice uses position to form a corharent sentence or a complete thought."
1,How do you spell has been?,"D-i-c-e. His act is so similar to his early years that it is sad. It is real sad to see someone who had so much talent, and then see that same person do material that is nothing more than rehashed bits. Sorry, Dice, I was a big fan, but you simply aren't funny anymore."
1,Lame,He made his living off pushing the limits of what was allowable. This dude doesn't entertain himself. Super tired.
1,Album,"Your album reeks, plus you should thank opie & anthony for saving your career. Now i know why howard stern dumped you. You are simply not funny, give it up. Later, Dice."
1,Dice=80s has-been,"This CD is really nasty. Dice doesn't really have any talent. The only way he gets laughs is through telling disgusting jokes, is that funny?"
3,"Good, but not still not back to his old form","This CD is a bit of a comeback after the horrible ""The Day the Laughter Died, Part II."" That album was released seven years ago. It seemed as if Dice had lost his touch. This is a good album that has funny and unfunny moments. On the whole, however, this is a quality effort. Unfortunately, most of his fans have quit on him.

I don't like the cover, however. I think it's tacky, and it says to the audience that this artist is washed up and the only way they'll buy this is if naked girls are pictured on the cover (like a 1998 2 Live Crew album)."
4,More Dice...about time!,"First off, you may have noticed all the complaints about Dice doing the same old offensive material, if you liked DICE, 40 TOO LONG and DICE RULES you will like this album. Of course he's doing the same sort of stuff, he just changes the names of the people in his bits, so what! When I listen to Dice I am expecting this sledge-hammer type comedy, expecting anything else would be like wanting to hear AC/DC sing love songs?! This album is good, there is even a cool mini-poster of Dice and a couple of ""fans"" in the jacket. So there is some Rap music on this (Snoop Dogg) CD, the rest of the album is strong enough to overcome that lapse in judgment. Oriental midgets who like newer style phones may get sick of Dice's humor but I never will. The world would be a more boring place without Un-PC humor like that on this CD."
2,The plane left and he is still here. He is nuts. Lost his m,The poor guy is great but he just lost his mind! he has run out of things to say. So he is just babling and doing things with people who should not even be involved with comedy. (get it?)I like the old DICE but he is just plane old insane. Mark my words!! It wont be long when you will hear that they locked up dice in a looney ward. You'll see. Everyone thinks he says these things cause he is funny. He aint funny he is NUTS. 110% All beef nuts.
1,Horrible,Dice lost it about 10 years ago. He has not been funny since then. He needs a career change.
1,Not very funny,"Dice has not changed much in the last 10 years. His bit was funny, but, it has grown stale. Also, there is something really disturbing about Dice telling dirty jokes. It is sorta like your overweight, gray-haired, father telling dirty jokes. It is just plain disturbing."
2,Jockey underwear purchased thru Amazon,"A great brand with a wide assortment of nice products. Was incredibly surprised to find a small hole in the back of the panty after one wearing, one machine washing!! Quite disappointing!"
1,"Elegance Hipster 3 Pack, black mix, 6","I was very happy to find these hipsters in black again. I was hoping they were black when noticing that the color was stated in ""black mix""! They are indeed just black, all three in the pack.I have been wearing jockey's hipsters, 100% cotton, for years and like I mentioned before, out of nowhere they did not carry these in black any more. The white ones have changed over the years, however they are still OK. Also, the color ""nude"" has disappeared, at least I could not find them lately.To come back to my order of black Jockey hipsters, very disappointing. The sizing was not too correct and every leg-opening was different! Needless to say, I returned them. Lately there is a LOT of trouble with sizing, even within the same product in the same size! I would not recommend ordering these to anyone."
4,"Not a replacement,,,","I ordered these in hopes to replace my Lane Bryant panties that are so expensive. Didn't work though, they just do not fit me properly."
4,to the long winded 2 star review,"Its a kids movie dude. The only people buying and watching this are people like me who watched it as a kid and wants their kids to watch it. Its that simple. Its a kid friendly ghost story that sends a positive family message. That's it. It stars Berry van Dyke following the fail of Airwolf when Canada ruined it.Bottom line you knew it was a kids movie, it was on the Disney channel in the 80's so its your problem, not the movie.Writing a rant about a kids ghost story movie just goes to show how much free time one has when he still lives in his mothers basement."
2,Silly Language and Lame Jokes,"I don't know if the Roma really speak that way and maybe on stage it works well. However, in the printed version the dialect was quite silly. The Esme character who is one of the leads simply did not carry the moral authority the author wanted her to have. After ripping up her passport I had the impression that a few weeks after living like a Roma, this middle-class girl would be lining up at the Canadian embassy to go home. And what's with the joke about Stefan calling himself a ""cunning linguist"". Hello, Ms. Gibson, it's a complete ripoff from a James Bond movie."
2,Victim of the loudness war,"Great selection of Rocio's work however, audio is really bad, no dynamic range due to levels at or above distortion for a perceived loudness effect which is common in today's CDs. Totally unlistenable on headphones. I recommend an earlier version of these songs on other labels that have not been digitally remastered.(Audio mui distorcionado por medio de volumen exagerado. Es recomendado obtener su musica en otras compilaciones.)"
1,Horrible!!!,"I regret buying this wipes. They leave water spots all over my dash board especially on plastic. That's pretty much what it does, leave water spots. I could have used baby wipes and gotten the same or better results. Goshhhhh dont people test their products before they sell it?"
2,Out of date study of the President's ancestry,"The President's ancestry is rarely taken back to before 1776. Its a fluffed book, with little modern research not included."
5,great tire,"excellent tire, great price and fast service. have these on my harley and they perform very well. i would recommend these tires for any motorcycle."
3,The Other Reviews are for a Different Film,"The other reviews here are for a different film. You will note they are referencing Humphrey Bogart and the Dead End Kids - all of whom had died a long time before this film was made. This is the 2001 vehicle with David Carradine and Richard Moll. I find the fact that there are people who found those reviews useful somewhat humorous. I liked the Bogart film, too, but this isn't it."
1,crime school,"i originally thought this was the humphrey bogart movie, the only reason i kept it because it would cost more to return than to keep.i did watch the movie and it was a total disappointemt. i would never wacth it again!!!!!"
3,Teeth aren't large enough and don't easily cut all bread types.,Bought this knife to replace one I loved that was accidentally taken at a potluck supper. The teeth on this knife are too small and don't cut all bread types easily and the handle is not as comfortable as my lost knife.
4,Good bedtime book,Cute story and illustrations. It sort of remind me of Calvin and Hobbes for some reason. This is a good night time story - my 3-year-old really enjoys it!
5,LOVE,Me and my kids LOVE this book. It's so cute how the author puts the boy in the parents perspective.
4,My 2 year old loves this book,"Fun book, not at all scary like I thought it may be. A tiger in a little kid's closet! But he's a silly tiger that keeps the little boy awake at night by making all kinds of noise. Its hard to sleep when there's a talented tiger doing cartwheels in your closet. They end up working it out, well kind of.-imaginative book-great illustrations-suitable for young and older children alike (6 & 9 y\o nephews love it too)"
4,Creative and Catchy,What a creative and catchy book for children! My two year old grandson loves all things to do with lions and tigers and this is perfect. The boy is trying to sleep and the tiger is eating potato chips in the closet and the crunching keeps the boy awake. This is just the first cute episode between the boy and the tiger. The dialogue has repetition which kids love and the ending is delightful! the pictures are superb. We'll be enjoying this book for a long time.
5,My child has book MEMORIZED!,"Hands down one of the BEST bed-time stories, yet. It's part of our night-time routine...bedtime seems empty without reading this story. My child has all the lines down...can't actually read, yet, but could surely fool some one with this book! It's a definite favorite in our house!"
4,Understanding Owls - Boring? Or a hoot?,"I purchased this title after reading her second book: ""Understanding Birds of Prey""; and I found this to have been both an interesting and informative read. This book, lives up to, if not exceeds that high standard that her preceeding books have set. When I hope to purchase an owl of my own, this book will act as my bible! Her unique, if not aggressive, writing style makes other Birds of Prey authors seem almost lax in their approach to informing the reader. Well worth the money spent and allows one to make an informed decision regarding captive birds."
5,Fantastic,"This book is truely great!! It has provided me with the vital information required to keep an Owl. The chapter on training the bird was most interesting and continues to be most useful!! I recommend this book to anyone seriously considering to going into Owls, you won't regret it!!"
5,A gripping read that will keep you engrossed for hours,"This was my first taster of military material, and all the way through reading this book, I couldn't put it down....It is told in such a way that you think you are there with them.An excellent book, that has lead me to reading the other two Andy McNab Books and buying his video.I also recommend Chris Ryans' books - especially The One that Got Away, as it is the same story from Chriss' point of view, as they were both part of the same squad - although I must say Andy writes it better than Chris !!"
3,Bummer hat,"The doll is fine, it's the hat. I don't think it ever fit. We have the woody doll for my son and my daughter gets mad because Jesses hat will not stay on."
3,Big disappointment,"My daughter loves the 2 movies. She has the woody doll and it has gone everyplace with us for 2 years! We decided to get the Jessie thinking that it would be made the same as woody. Well, it wasn't at all. She doesn't have yarn hair or plastic. The hair is just like a regular Barbie doll and I'm sure you know what that means. What will happen is she'll play with this doll for about 2 days and it will look like a dirty ol' toy with a knotted head of hair. If there is a doll just like woody could someone email me about it?"
2,headless jessie,The idea of the doll is wonderful. The only problem I have is the teeny tiny skinny neck they put on her and the large oversized head with a hat that wont stay on. So my daughter tries to push down hard on the hat so that maybe it will stick on and the head comes off. We can't repair it. Whatever happened to the dolls in the 70's and 80's from mattel with the heads that you could take on an off. I think they changed them so that once they come off you have to buy a new doll because of the little plastic ball has broken off inside the head that it turns on and you have to throw it away. My daughter loved the jesse doll until it broke then she cried an I had to throw it away.
3,"So cute, but how long will it last?","I bought this Jessie doll for my 3 yr. old daughter, who loves anything Jessie. She was so upset when she tried to put the hat on Jessie's head and it wouldn't stay on. Nothing we did seemed to keep the hat on the head. The head has been pulled out twice and we were able to put it back on.It's the cutest doll, but doesn't seem real sturdy."
2,Can't win them all,I bought this toy for my daughter and I was more excited than she was. She loved the movie and she did play with Jesse but the hat didn't stay on and she was much smaller than the Woody doll I bought some where else. We still have the doll. I would say she has played with her maybe 20% of the time.
5,A great collection,"I picked up this book after a recommendation from a friend and from the first story on I was hooked. I read the whole book in one day. It is that good. Mr. McCrann's stories are suspenseful, edgy, splashed with black humor and excellent characterizations. It reminded me of some of Stephen King's earlier works. My favorites were ""The Wail of the Banshee"" in which an elderly woman puts up with an abusive husband, ""What needs doing will get done"", the points a father will take to make his young son happy, ""Close your eyes Sweet Angel"", a gripping story that really moved me, and ""The Lizard's Tale"", probably my favorite out of all for its unexpected ending. This is a must for anyone who enjoys horror and suspense. Highly recommended."
1,Crap,"When my high school teacher (at a Catholic high school) made us read this book in the early sixties, I questioned its lack of documentation and its biased perspective. My teacher questioned my patriotism. I recently re-read the book (I save and savor what I have read). The book is a piece of Cold War, paranoid, crap. I understand why some right-wing, anti-Obama reviewer may recommend it, but it's only instructive as to what was wrong in the Red-scare, racist America of the early 60s."
4,WASP more than meets the image,"WASP has cultivated an image that is not reflective of this really great rock and roll band. Somewhere along the line WASP took off and developed a small cult following using costumes and on-stage antics (throwing raw meat, explatives etc.) This has kept a much larger main-stream audience away from their music. I was recently aquainted with the WASP catalog through the XM radio station the BoneYard. This is a great rock and roll band. Forget the image and the antics and just ""Let the music do the talking"" these guys are great!!"
1,do not buy this product,"No matter where I set my temperature controls on the grill, this thermometer always reads the temp at 500 degrees or more. I placed the thermometer in our oven and set the oven for 350 degrees yet the thermometer showed the temp at 450-500. I have called Taylor's customer service on several occasions and they never bother to call back. I would never buy another Taylor product."
1,"Whoops, bad product.","Well, I LOVED the idea of this surface thermometer, and it actually worked great... the first time. After that, the surface area blacked and became unreadable. While the arrow still probably showed an accurate temperature, I couldn't tell what it was as the grid was completely blacked out. It then became very unsightly to have on the grill, and I tossed it.I've moved on to the old fashioned way of testing my grill... hand over heat, and count.Just feel bad I gave this as a gift as well... my brother got as many uses as I did."
1,Terrible!!!!,"I don't know of any band in the industrial scene who is more flip floppy than Mentalo & The Fixer. When this band makes a good album it's really good, and when they make a bad album it's really, really, bad. This album...sucks!! It really, really, really sucks. Don't bother."
4,Still Worth Buying,This is the ONLY complete recording of Ernst's Six Polyphonic Etudes and Wieniawski's Op.10 Caprices. Ricci's acrobatic technique in this recording is not at its usual brilliance. It is particularly noticeable that the Staccato Etude he recorded earlier was much better. The Sautille etude is unclean and scratchy. Yet any serious violinist should consider purchasing this CD since it displays some of the most difficult repertoire in its entirety.
2,Sloppy Playing & Sloppy Recording,"What a horrible recording! I'm dumbfounded that this actually made it out of the recording studio. Ricci's playing is sloppy and full of mistakes. The recording quality doesn't help either; I could barely hear it. Ricci must have been 200 feet away from the microphone! He should take a lesson from Isaac Stern, who practically plays on top of the microphone. I know that it's hard to find a recording of all of the Polyphonic Studies, but this one is sure to disappoint."
1,No Justice For Poor Wieniawski,This is truly painful right from the first note. Not even worthy of a promising student performer. Unfortunately Mr. Ricci is travelling only on his name for this one. Pity the unsuspecting customer who hears this. If you are new to the violin this could turn you off for good. Avoid at all costs!
2,Cons outweigh the Pros,"PROS:1. Lots of power. When you need it, it's great.2. Easy-clean beaters. (But most newer models have these.)3. Natural angle of handle makes for easier mixing, and rubber handle is easy to grip with messy fingers.4. Storage case is a nice add-on.CONS:1. Too much power. The lowest speed is too fast for some tasks.2. Useless spatula attachment. I was intrigued by this idea, and it clinched my decision to buy this model, but it fell off within the first 10 seconds of use.3. Very awkward control switch. The speed control is a switch you flip from left to right with your thumb, unlike other mixers I've used with a natural forward-backward motion. This is not just uncomfortable; it is actually difficult to stop somewhere in the middle without flipping the switch to full power and spewing batter all over the kitchen."
2,I'm glad there's two sets of attachments...,"Yes, the blender is very powerful and I have to take more ease at not letting it spit batter or filling anywhere. After a couple of uses with the ""beater"" attachments, one of the whiskers broke off!! Now I have to go through the trouble of finding a replacement arm."
5,Black and Decker Hand Mixer,"The Black and Decker hand mixer is for the money the best quality and the most powerful. It has the attachments I want and need and it will sit on the end and not tip. It is the most powerful at 230 watts, ranking with the, competition it stands out above the rest in looks and being user freindly. As with all Black and Decker equipment it will last."
3,Nice Mixer but too much Power,"This is a nice mixer, but in my opinion, it needs a slower speed. I bought this one because I thought it was nice and powerful - which it is. The problem is that it is too powerful. I wish it had a slower speed - the lowest speed it has a very fast and spits food out all over the place. (Especially powdered sugar). It is great for some things but not for others. The weight of this is nice and mine came with a nice little storage box. I haven't used the spatula attachement yet, so I can't comment on that."
1,Big Bass Zone: Catch Monster Bass,"After reading two other books on the subject (John Hope and Bill Murphy) I was really pumped to read this one. Then I got into it and found it 'vague at best'... what did I learn? Big bass can be anywhere and basically 'do what they want, when they want'. It's up to the angler to be open-minded and try to fit the approach to the situation...Again, this book was very difficult for me to read. I constantly found my self fighting off frustration as I'd re-read sections looking for 'real information'...Not to be found."
5,Truth & Beauty,"Yes, C. Dale Young has written a gorgeous first collection, but beauty--of landscape, of the love between men, of art--is never for its own sake, and never at the disservice of truth. For underneath all of the fine details are concerns of exile and empire in his Caribbean poems (one in particular, ""On Privilege,"" belongs in all of the anthologies); and the impermanence of art and love. This is a bold, polished, and often tender (see ""Broughtonia"") first book, filled with rich, complicated poems that repay rereading. Do not miss this book."
2,Less than stellar,"Some nice images here, but little else. Many of the poems in this book are sterile and dull. This is the type of poetry that convinces people that Poetry is academic and boring. Young clearly had too much fun with histories, dictionaries, and a thesaurus."
1,Disappointing,"This book is a perfect example of how some in this younger generation revere the lackluster Formalism of the 1950's. These poems are pretty things without much behind them, as if nothing but beautiful and shallow things exist in the world. If Young weren't an influential poetry editor himself, it is unlikely this book would have been published. It is no wonder his poems are compared to James Merrill's; they stink of privilege and society and the moneyed life with its foolish concerns. But that isn't real poetry, nor is it life for most of us. Insomnia has no chance with this book in hand."
5,The best car care product I ever bought,"I loved to clean and wax my car occasionally, I don't need showroom quality but I loved my car to be clean and shine, and I only have limited time to do this so I prefer a product that is easy to use and don't require extra long time to cure.This product is much better than other car care product I ever use, it does clean, wax and polish all in one step and the coating is amazingly long lasting, best of all it can apply to all surface (glass, chrome, plastic etc) that won't leave wax mark on trims, I applied it once every few months and the surface still feels smooth and water still beads.Just a reminder don't apply it on windshield otherwise will get squeeze noise when you're using your wiper."
1,Nothing can survive,"Betta require atleast one gallon to be happy and healthy. This grossly over-price piece of crap only holds a quarter of that. This means that your betta would slowly die of ammonia build up and burns. If some how the ammonia and the ills it causes didn't kill your betta it'd likely start eating itself out of boredom.Besides a betta can not even move in the thing, if you want your betta that motionless, just get a picture or statue of a betta instead."
1,Horrible thing for a betta,"This is WAY too small to house a betta. Despite common misconceptions, bettas are NOT happy confined to small amounts of water. They do not live in puddles their entire lives. They live in rice paddies which are flooded during the rainy season and slowly dry up and become shallow puddles for a while and then flood again. They have adapted to survive in shallows, but will not thrive.The tiny amount of water in this contraption will not only build up ammonia quickly, but will also fluctuate in temperature. In other words, it will KILL YOUR FISH!If you want to keep a betta, please do some research and house him properly."
1,Thumbs down. Do some research before housing your Betta.,"I'm sorry but a living, feeling creature is not a good way to ACCESSORIZE your desk. Not unless you put them in an adaquate living space and maintain good water quality and proper feeding. This tiny, tiny amount of space is not sufficient to house a betta. I should know, I am a betta owner and seeing contraptions like this make me wince imagining how many bettas have suffered being stuffed into them for their short lives(bettas do not naturally have short lives, they have been proven to live up to 10 years in a lab with good food and exercise) but they WILL have a short life if you put them in this nightmare death-trap thing."
1,Barbaric,"THIS IS WHAT THIS IS!!!This is one of the worst 'betta bowls' i have ever seen, the 5gallon bowls make me cringe this is not even one gallon!!!How this can possibly be sold is beyond me, besides the fact it is inhumane i would bet that the fish will die within a week.This should be taken off the market!"
5,Great Music from a Great Band!,"Reminds me of way back when in the 70's, in the UK, when my hair was long, my teeth were white and my friends and I would smoke cannabis at rock shows at Kilburn and not worry about the rozzers! Oi! Those were the days!"
4,The Very True Tribute...,"This is one of the best tribute to Michael Jackson I have ever heard. There are '80's hits of Michael Jackson such as Thriller and Billie Jean. These two songs represent the Michael and the '80's with there smooth, yet danceable sounds. Who can forget the catchy line from Thriller or the ultra-smooth sound of Billie Jean. Michael closed out the '80's with his hip song Bad which is not only hip but a new kick into what Michael had in store for us. This album contains older songs from the '70's such as ABC which is pure fun-lovin groove. Rock with You is a sleek shakable song with great, touchable lyrics. Don't Stop 'till you Get Enough explains its self. You cannot get enough of the beat and all you want to do is dance. This CD is excellent, although I would have loved to hear some '90's classics on it such as Remeber the Time, Dangerous, and You are Not Alone. The CD is a total time line of Michael's work and I totally recommend it to any Michael Jackson fan."
1,"Open your eyes, this book is NOT the ""unvarnished truth""","It's a shame that so many of the reviews here are by people who have confused negativity with the truth. Neely's book is not well researched, nor is it especially accurate. All of her sources were slanted against the band, and I noticed a number of factual errors in the text. Maybe someday someone will write a bio of Pearl Jam that tells the real story, but this isn't it."
2,Wanted the Pearl Jam Story: Got anti-Vedder story,"I was hoping to read a book about Pearl Jam and their music, but ended up with a slam of the lead singer. It started out good, with background of the Seattle scene, but the last half of the book seemed to be dedicated to Vedder. Unfortunately, the stories and quotes were all from people that have grudges against the singer, making the whole book slanted and prejudiced. I couldn't enjoy it after that without a grain of salt. Basing most of her information on quotes from the drummer that had been fired and blamed Vedder, and the step-father after a bitter divorce from Vedder's mother is not what I consider good journalism. Pearl Jams music, along with the other band members, or anything that has happened since Vs. was released was barely mentioned. Not a well rounded or informative read."
5,A great reference to everything you need to know about PJ.,Gives detailed account of the band member's early life. Great account of Eddie's childhood. Thorough description of the band's music and their life on the road. A must have for any true Pearl Jam fan.
4,An informative book,"Interesting reading full of facts that may enlighten you and give you better understanding to the band.The thing I didn't like about the book is that although it covered the early album and tours, explaining every song in detail, it says less and less about the other albums. It is good the book has a chapter about Eddie Vedder, but where are the chapters about the rest of the band members??. Pearl Jam is formed by 5 guys not just one!"
4,Detailed and Entertaining,"I loved this book, and would give this book 5 stars, but I reserve that rank to the great classics. FIVE AGAINST ONE isn't literary genius, but is still an excellent read. Neely is very objective in her book, seperating the myths of the Pearl Jam legend from the facts of the Pearl Jam reality. I found myself cringing from time to time, mainly because Neely doesn't pull too many punches...Eddie isn't portrayed as the nicest guy around, and I came away from the book feeling very sorry for Dave Abbruzzese, who obviously contributed quite a bit of information about his conflicts with Vedder. Since much of the book focuses on Eddie and Dave, there leaves litte room for info about Jeff, Stone, and Mike, outside of the pre-PJ chapters. Still, the book is very entertaining, revealing some neat tidbits about the band's history."
5,Great book a must read for any Pearl Jam fan,Five Against One: The Pearl Jam Story was the best book I have read in the past 5 years. From start to finish it has nothing but useful information about the worlds greatest band Pearl Jam. From the bands origins to the troublesome life of Eddie Vedder this book has it all. Everyone go out and get a copy.
1,Neely Against Vedder: The Five Against One Story,"I have a hard time understanding how someone who is ostensibly both a journalist and a Pearl Jam fan could write something like ""Five Against One"". I could detect no journalistic integrity nor any love for the band in this book. ""Five Against One"" is not about the music of Pearl Jam, nor can it honestly be called ""The Pearl Jam Story"", despite the subtitle. While this book does contain some interesting facts about the band and its members, Neely's real goal seems to be to shoot down Eddie Vedder. The majority of the book reads like a malicious tabloid kiss-and-tell confessional."
3,Eh,"This book was so-so. The biggest problem was that 90% of it was devoted to ""Ten"" and its tour. It's like ""Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten Ten. Oh yeah, they did a few more albums, too."" Any real Pearl Jam fan, such as myself, should be upset that so little time was devoted to the 4 records since then."
2,"Poorly Written, Biased Book","This book is tabloid journalism at best. It reads like the author conducted long interviews with only two sources--PJ's bitter second drummer and Eddie Vedder's estranged step-father. Both clearly had an ax to grind. The rest of the book seems like a distillation of many press clippings.What's more, I don't even enjoy Pearl Jam's music as much as I did during the early 1990s, so I'm not a overzealous fan trying to protect the band's legacy. I simply wanted to read a well-balanced, well-written account of Pearl Jam's history. Skip this book. Reading it was a waste of time."
4,interesting and full-covered biography,"this is a quite full and interestnig biography concerning the first years of the PJ history also relating to the beginning of this (and other) seattle bands, which is of particular value to grunge fans i think, because this is now part of the rock n roll history!the book gave me a human description of the band's mates and i was interested to read about the abruzzese period and the way it ended.so i think the PJ story written in this book is a good description of the direction the band took since 1996 til today. i was also interested about the vedder's personal life chapters, but eventually i am not sure whether it is a good idea revealing really personal facts, but anyway it helps understanding vedder personnality , phylosophy and music.Enjoy it, it is easy to read, and excuse my english faults."
2,Thanks for the info reviewers,"I've recently redicovered Pearl Jam, and wanted to read more about them. Although I saw in a review of antoehr PJ book to look to this one for the ""real truth"", well from the big PJ fans that the full story can't be found here either. And maybe that's good. Let the guys play music and have some privacy."
5,Loved it.,"A great book. Informative and with many ""laugh out loud"" stories about the band. I could not put it down. I have all the books about Pearl Jam, and this one is definitely the best."
3,Great book!,"This book is fantastic. It kept my attention the whole way through it, and it was fun to read. It is a must read for any Pearl Jam fan."
3,Ed Vedder biography,"The first half of this book was great. It gave a very detailed look into the Seattle music scene of the late 80's, early 90's, but most importantly how tragedy brought together the greatest rock band of our generation. Unfortunetly somewhere near the middle, this book turned into a biography on Eddie Vedder. Frankly, Eddie Vedder's childhood and early life aren't that interesting. If you're a die hard P.J. fan, buy the book, otherwise forget it."
2,Eddie Vedder Bashing Book,"Although I found the writings riveting I soon realized the author had an agenda. I kept reading expecting to find a nice story about Vedder but didnt find any. Why did Kim interview only those that had a bone to pick with Eddie? How could he be such an ### yet captivate so many? Its as if she wrote the book for Ticket Master, Dave (bitter former drummer) and his angry ""i have to take my troubles with Eddie public for my own protection"" stepfather. How can an author write about someone in such a biased way? If you want DIRT and nothing else watch Jerry Springer. The author is a BASHER and should write strickly for cheap gossip magazines."
1,A book by a jealous woman,"I think it's obvious that this whole bitter book is driven by Kim Neely's unrequited love for Eddie Vedder. Notice how she has nothing but bad things to say about his wife. Get over yourself Kim! We all love Eddie, but there's only one of him and he's taken already."
3,This Greek Goddess Should Stick With The Traditional Songs,"Well there's a little bit of everything on this 2 CD set. Dance - Techno Pop - Romantic Ballad - Contemporary and Traditional. Some of it is excellent, some not so good. Despina is incredible on the traditional and romantic material, however when she speeds up the tempo for the dance and techno tracks her voice suffers considerably.If you are going to buy just one Despina CD for your collection I'd look for a copy of her now OOP '10 Entoles.'"
3,Not A Dance Album,"So yeah, you hear ""Gia"", and ""Opa Opa"" and you're convinced this Greek vixen is the next dance diva. Or...not. A lot of her double CD sounds like traditional Greek music...no thumping dance beats, no synths...""real"" instruments, and a very typical Greek swagger. The album boasts only two english tracks...""Gia"" and ""Opa Opa"" (which later are also in Greek)Not that there's anything wrong with this. The album itself is good, but my rating is low based on dashing of expectations.If you're looking for a dance album, don't pick this up. If you're looking for a decent album that expresses the country the singer is from, perhaps think about getting Despina Vandi. It's definitely interesting."
2,They cut the part of the movie that you really wanted to see.,"I do not understand why, but for some reason, they cut the scenes with hot naked girls short for more of the story. Nobody watches soft-core for the acting or story, its for hot naked girls, which this DVD has given us less than the full amount of. I recall the scenes with Lisa Throw and Shyra Deland to be far far longer in the uncut version"
1,Not the Cable version,There just to much of the movie cut out. If you have seen this movie on cable you will be very disapointed.
3,OK workout tape,"This video is ok. It drags a bit between circuits and is not the challenge I thought it would be. If you're used to working out and doing aerobic type of exercise, it's not for you."
3,Too little Scotus; too much Cross,"I bought the book hoping that I would get a clear explanation of Scotus' views from within. Instead I found an exposition of an analytic philosophers contracted views on Scotus. To be blunt, Cross should not presume that the reader cares about his views in a work that purports to expound Scotus' views. I find this to be a common defect amongst the analytic philosophers, who seem intent upon telling us that we can make good use mediaeval philosophy, but fail to see that they themselves are peripheral to that ressourcement. I give it three stars for the sake of Duns Scotus, not for the sake of Cross. Beware also his work on the Physics of Duns Scotus, unless, that is, you are an analytic philosopher."
4,Singing Bowls 101.,"This is a good book for discovering the history of Singing Bowls, how they work and how to choose one. It also has a section on Tingshaws, Bell and Dorje. If your looking for a book on how to use them for healing then you should get the book ""Singing Bowl Exercises for Personal harmony"" by Anneke Huyser"
3,very informative handbook for beginers,The book informs people of the need in Western society to use these Bowls for Meditation & cleansing the Body & the Soul in order to release & open the door to further spiritual development. ( I Teach Meditation useing these Bowls )
3,good for beginers,"This book is good for people who doesn't know anything about singing bowls, and want to know what is it all about. However, if you are trying to get some basic skill for using singing bowls, This book provide too little infomation about this."
5,Singing Bowls,"Small book,doesn't have complete Singing Bowl info, but a good short overview of a complex topic (including tingshas, Tibetan bells).I have since ordered other books, to round out my knowledge. I found this easy to read book to be a good introduction to the topic."
2,"Exquisite, but not made of the highest quality material.","Ginkgo used to make their Varberg flatware with 18/10 stainless. I think around two years ago, due to rising prices of the 18/10 stainless, they began making their Varberg flatware using 18/0 stainless. The description for this product is out-of-date. The product currently being advertised is made of 18/0 stainless, which agrees with the product features listed.That said, the Varberg design is exquisite. However, 18/0 stainless isn't really all that great, to put it lightly."
2,Ginkgo Stainless is 18/0 NOT 18/10,"If the stainless the first reviewer has in her hand is 18/10, then Ginkgo has changed the composition of its stainless in the past three years. I, too, have a piece in my hand and it is 18/0 (purchased within the past month). Stainless steel used in flatware is a composite of different steels and varies in terms of grades for different uses. The main ingredient in flatware is chromium and nickel has been added to provide a resistance to corrosion.Therefore flatware that is 18/10 means that 18% is chromium and 10% is nickel. The higher the nickel content, the more protection the flatware has from corrosion. Prices of stainless steel flatware vary considerably depending on these specs, so don't be fooled into thinking you are buying the best quality, if the nickel content is 0%. This is unfortunate because I really like the simplicity of the Ginkgo Varberg design."
1,NOT 18/10 -- each piece marked 18/0 -- Not what you pay for,"I was all impressed when I received this flatware set, the product description states it is ""18/10"". However, after washing the set, I read the back of several pieces, all were marked ""18/0"" which, in reality, is some of the cheapest material that flatware can be made. ""18/0"" will rust easily over time. If it were truely ""18/10"" rust would not be a concern. I returned my set. For $96, I want REAL 18/10....I can buy 18/0 for half the price, since it is half the quality."
4,Recommended,"I read this book for a biology class. I found itto be very useful and informative. However, Iwouldn't recommend it for anyone who has lessthan a college level reading ability, because itis very wordy and contains a lot of technicalterms. Other than that, it is a good book, and isuseful as an introduction and overview of biology."
5,Tie down,I love my new tie down pack. It fits very well with my tie. I will reconmmend to my friends to try it.
2,Basic dog book with bloodhound info.,"I have kept dogs for many years and was looking for an in-depth bloodhound reference book. Unfortunately this is not the book.It is very basic in nature, only has a small section that is bloodhound specific and is mostly a ""how to care for any dog"" book."
2,Bloodhounds found lacking,"This is a generic dog book disguised as a bloodhound book. Out of 192 pages, only 30 pages are about the bloodhound breed. I was very disappointed."
1,Worst I've ever used.,"I didn't care for this at all. First of all, the smell is unpleasant. It doesn't linger horribly however, so I would be able to get past that if it was the only drawback. Second, it did not detangle my hair. I've got mid-back length, fine/thick hair so I need a good detangler and this did literally nothing to detangle. Third, it made my hair appear slightly greasy later on that same day. Even argan oil serum didn't do that. I know that some people love this stuff, but I would give this zero stars if I could. Yuck."
1,Find another steam cleaner.,"The brush accessory wore down quickly. Unable to find replacement parts for it. Now, I have steam coming out from the cap and it won't come out from the hose. I didn't get much use out of it. I love using a steam cleaner but will be finding a different brand, hopefully one with an on/off switch and maybe a little smaller. The steam buggy is kind of bulky for household cleaning."
2,No repair/customer service,I have a broken cap and cannot get any customer service. Tristar does not answer back. I suppose I'm stuck with a piece of garbage.
1,piece of junk,"(...)I bought the steam buggy and used it for 10minutes before I realized this is a total rip-off.The steam buggy doesn't deliver pressurized steam,and you could do just as well by holding up yoursteam iron to your countertop and then wiping the dirt.Nice idea, but unless you're willing to pay 1000 dollarsfor a professional model, stick to the chemicals... theymay be harmful to the environment, but at least they work."
1,SMALL SCRUB BRUSH,"does not lock into place on this steamer (on mine anyway) and falls off after no more than 10 seconds of cleaning. It is a terrible plastic on metal ""connection"" that simply does not work. Using it without the scrub brush does not work either, unless you want to burn your hand scrubbing. As a result, I find this machine pretty much worthless."
1,"don't bother, in most cases","I've now had this a year and have used it about 4 times. It's simply too much of a pain to use--you have to get it out, set it up, wait for it to heat up, and it's not terribly powerful anyway. if you want a real steam cleaner, I would suggest a more professional model. It is useful for nasty baked-on stuff (like in the microwave), things that are hard to scrub or have crevices (birdcages, shower door tracks) and sanitizing. i definitely wouldn't buy it again--i paid $$ and that doesn't justify the use I get out of it."
2,"Works pretty good, but the cap did break","I borrowed my mother's steam cleaner to clean my stove. I've used it once before had have seem her use it several times, but this time we had problems opening the cap to put the water in. I couldn't get it to budge. I even had my husband try, and he couldn't do it either. He finally got out a wrench, and when he finally popped it open, the cap had broken and we couldn't even use it. Basically the machine had melted the cap and it became brittle and broke. I found another website where someone else had the same problem. The problem I have now is trying to track down the manufacturer and get the cap replaced. My suggestion is to put a little bit more money into a better machine."
1,Steam Buggy,If you like to waste your money this is the product for you! This is the biggest piece... I've ever bought.I used it for 2-3 hours in my home and found it doesn't clean any better than a ordinary sponge. In fact the areas I used it on I had to go back and reclean because it simply doesn't work. I thought this would be a great thing to have with young children in the house but this only makes you work twice as hard and three times as long for minimal/no results. It did clean a little but only stuff that was light (dust) and I gave up on my oven after 15 minutes of standing there spraying the door with no results. Hold you cup of coffee near what you want to clean...will work just as good.
3,Accessories,I do like my steam buggy but found that I had to use the accessories for almost everything. I cleaned a barbeque that had never been cleaned (except the grill) for 10 years. It is stainless steel and cleaned up like a charm. Also cleaned a shower floor that was stained when we moved in and got it spotless also using the brushes. I need new brushes and cant find anything anywhere on how to get them. HELP
2,Well almost...,"The Steam Buggy will clean *some* of your messes as advertised, but not all of them. While the unit works well for recent spills, anything that is a little older will require more work than you would need to do it with a sponge and cleanser.The steam produced, while enough to break up a dried spill, or some mildew, is not nearly hot enough to sterilize. This indicates that you would need to not only steam buggy your messes, but follow up with a disinfectant... this defeats the purpose of the steam. It does work great at defrosting your freezer though!I would recommend this to someone looking for another way to supplement their current cleaning processes, but this is not a replacement for conventional methods!"
1,Broke After Minimal Use/Leaks,"I had read good things about Steam Buggy and it worked OK for the half dozen or so times I did use it. I used it to get off wallpaper but it did leak so I burned my hand with the hot water. Tightening the attachments didn't help. I also used it to steam clean my stairs and it worked fine. I didn't use it for about 4 months and when I tried to remove the cap, it was impossible to remove. I had to take it to my auto mechanic and even with his tools, he couldn't remove it without breaking it. I've noticed other reviewers talk about the cap breaking. TriStar is impossible to get in touch with. I tried calling for days to no avail. I'm tossing Steam Buggy and buying the McCulloch MC-1275 Steam Cleaner since it got good reviews on this site. If you get a Steam Buggy, remove the cap when storing it, especially if you don't use it often."
1,What a joke,"I bought this after seeing the infomercials probably 20 times.The only things it did much good cleaning was the bathroom (toilet) area and getting dust off of window blinds.It cleaned some mildew in the shower tile cracks but not all!?Useless for cleaning any scale buildup.As for the oven , it made the mess worse. The steam was splattering the greasy mess onto the nearby walls!Tried it on my motorcycle rims and it made a little progress, not much. Ended up using a scrub brush and cleaning the rims by hand.I returned mine for a refund."
1,disapointing,"Coy and derivative, with boring production and cheesy back up vocals, this recording doesn't do much to highlight Miss Porter's undeniable talent. After successful West End appearances, her entry into the pop world smacks not of individuality but of record company malaise. It's great to see an artist trying to express herself and write her own material, it's a shame they let her release these first drafts of songs, which fall well below the high standards of her ""influences"" Ricky lee jones and Carole King. etc."
4,Excellent visor for the price,"For all those dodgers fans, you can't go wrong here for the product to price comparison. While it may not be a perfect 10, it is for sure an 8, received as displayed, fits well, nice sturdy bill, would buy again."
3,Azymuth - Woodland Warrior,"Azymuth have been around since the 70s, but their music still remains fresh. Combining Brazilian jazz elements with a touch of modern electronics, Woodland Warrior is a journey right down the Amazon, replete with slap bass and crazy Hammond organ lines. Those who are looking for ""future jazz"" may be disappointed, because there's certainly more jazz than future (save the house kick drum on ""The Quest?""), but those who prefer funky jazz will find themselves in good company."
1,"Very Disappointing Lights, Lasted only 9 months","These lights are not worth the extra money! The Silverstars lasted only 6 months in my Dad's camry, and the Silverstars I installed in my Camry only lasted for 9 months. These bulbs blow out very quickly! Another major disappointment is that there isn't any improvement on the viewing distance of the lights. Visibility is the same as the standard bulbs that came with any car. The only difference is that these Silverstars are white light, instead of the yellow light from your standard bulbs.I'm not buying Sylvania Silverstars anymore."
4,Pretty good lamps,"I've been running a pair of these in one of my cars for just around three years now - they're the second best lamp bulbs I've used, the top spot goes to the SilverStar Ultras which I also have, but in a different vehicle.When I bought these the Ultras weren't available, but the only reason I wouldn't by these, is because I would be buying the Ultras, which are just a bit brighter and whiter.If you do a lot of night driving they're definitely worth looking at."
4,Brighter Whiter Light,I replaced the stock bulbs in my FJ Cruiser (which I thought were bright to begin with) using the Sylvania SilverStar 9003ST. Replacing one bulb at a time then turning the headlights on I was surprised to see how much whiter and brighter the 9003ST light was than the OEM bulb which looked yellowish. I can't testify as to how long they will last because they've only been installed for a couple of months and are also being used as daytime running lights on this vehicle which should shorten their life.
2,bright while it lasted,"the light was very bright when i installed it on my gf's car. my car has HID lights, and this buble is almost as bright as my HID. but the bulbs burned out fast, super fast to be exact. the left bulb burned out in about 8 month while the second one burned out 2 weeks later.i am quite angry at the build quality and would not recommend anyone buying these bulbs.please note that i used all pre-cautions during installation. i even wear gloves so my skin's grease would not get on the glass and cause partial over-heat. this bulb is very low quality."
1,Expect 200 hours of use from these - TERRIBLE,These lights have a TERRIBLE lifespan you can't tell from the packaging. Most OEM lights last 4-5 years or MORE and these have failed on me TWICE in less than 12 months. Warranty is ONE TIME - period. They will not replace them the second time they fail for the same person. Very poor choice for ANYONE.
1,Silverstar burnout,I have bought these bulbs for two years now and will go back to the original manufacturer's halogen lights. These do not even last 12 months. Definitely not worth going to these which give slightly more light but burn out in record time!
5,"Fast Shipment, Great Product","I received the product quickly, it was in perfect condition, they work like a champ. Now I can see better at night."
1,"Don't Walk, RUN...","DO NOT buy these bulbs!! I installed these for a while in our 2003 Honda Odyssey. I was VERY careful about not touching them, or allowing them to touch anything. The bulb housings are also free of condensation.PRO: As other reviewers have noted, they DO put out whiter light. And I did find that I had more visiblity, especially on clear nights along dark stretches of road.CON: If these bulbs last you 9 months, you're lucky. I have a full box of bulbs that only the brights will work. And even if I replaced them in pairs (I tried), I still would end up replacing one within 6 months. They are FAR to expensive to burn out this fast. While they're nice when working, they aren't worth the price difference.I too have switched to the ""Sylvania Extra Vision"" bulbs, which seem to have a little better life-span and put out whiter light than the standard bulb. But given my experience with these, I will never buy another set. I also can't see myself trying their ""Ultra"" bulbs, either."
1,Nice and bright - for 6 months,"Nice improvement in brightness over stock replacement bulbs, but they consistently do not last. I've gone through 4 bulbs -- with each lasting 6 to 9 months."
2,Nice While They Lasted,I purchased for my 2003 Tundra in March 2011 to replace the dim OEM bulbs and noticed today Dec 2012 one bulb was burned out so about an 18 month life span. Before buying I did read that the bulbs were short life and sensitive to improper handling so I was careful to not touch the glass with my fingers during installation. I have daytime running lights and think that may have accelerated the failure since the bulbs are on when the truck starts. A few other reviews make similar claims. Nice bulbs while they lasted but I think I will replace with something longer lasting.Update Feb 2013: Both bulbs are burned out now so they lasted just under two years. I switched to Philips Vision Plus to see if they will last any longer.
1,"lasted only 4 months, no real light improvement except white light","I tried couple of sets on two different cars. On both cars they lasted only 4-5 months. These bulbs give whiter light, but not more light. Infact visibility even dropped in rain and dark roadways where there are no reflective surfaces.Later I tried Sylvania Extra Vision, which are much better than Silver Stars, have been using these for more than 2 years. These give whiter light than Standard halogen and also little more light, and it cost less than half of Silver Stars(little more than standard).All in all Silver Start are useless eitherway you look at it. I would give zero stars if possible."
1,OK if you can afford to keep replacing them!,"It would be nice if they put the ""not expected to last 12 months"" label on the package! Had 2 sets on my Accord (low beams only), both lasted 9-10 months. I don't have driving lights and do minimal night driving. My factory lamps lasted 5 years, actually only one blew and I just put the other back in. Will stick with OEM."
2,"Great light, high price, short life, this bulb's not for me","Good news: Quality of light a noticeable improvement over standard halogens. Pattern of low beams, 'throw' of high beams, higher color temperature and brightness, all are good.Bad news: Purchased Sept. 2007, both low beams burnt out with one week in Jan 2008. Lifetime: ~4 months!!! Replacement lamps are NOT Silverstars.Price: $39 (pair) at Auto Zone. Standard bulbs: $18 (pair) at NAPA.Standard halogen life is probably closer to 2 years.Verdict: great light, but you'll pay a very high price to enjoy it."
2,lasted 3 months,"Both of my bulbs lasted just over 3 months. I thought there was something wrong with my car but it looks like it's just this line of bulbs. On the back of the packaging, these bulbs are rated with one ""bar"" for their longevity, and their standard 3100K bulb is rated with 4 bars.I never noticed these bulbs providing a great deal more light (though I live in an urban area so that likely affects it). I won't be buying them again."
2,"Bright light, dim future","I've been using the SilverStar lamps for several years and have experienced many failures. Typical lifetime is 4-8 months. They are great for improving visibility at night but they are very unreliable and probably not worth the cost. The high failure rate means I have to carry spares which is a little crazy at $40 per pair. Sylvania needs to improve the reliability of this prodoct. If you're looking for a bright headlight that will last for several years keep looking, these will disappoint you."
2,Expensive Way to Get Nice Light,"I made the mistake of switching over to SilverStar bulbs during the winter one year. The reason this was a mistake is that these bulbs only last about a year for me (and I foolishly have several years experience with these bulbs). As a result, when the weather gets cold and snowy, my headlights start going out. This happened to me last night which is what prompted me to review these bulbs. Obviously, replacing light bulbs is not all that fun when you don't have a heated garage.As for performance, they are nice bulbs. They do produce a nice, relatively white light as compared to other higher-end bulbs that turn your headlights blue. If Sylvania could figure-out a way to make the bulbs last longer, I'd stick with them. However, I think I'm going to start looking at other brands as I'm tired of the yearly bulb replacement."
5,She's Been There,"Basing her information on interviews with individuals throughout the Middle East, Trudy Rubin is not an armchair pundit. In addition to her most intelligent analysis, there is a sense of danger, as a reader follows her boldly foraging in Iraq. Her knowledge of the people and places in the Middle East imbue her writing with solid, factual common sense. Both candidates would do well to read through this book."
1,Trudy actually makes a living writing?,"In reading this book....it didn't take long to discover that Trudy's irrational hatred of Bush and his Administration has caused her to go ""willfully blind"" towards the facts. After seeing that she is a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer, I also checked out a few of her articles there. Conclusion: Trudy is an irredeemably liberal fruitcake, whose worldview does not put a premimium on the truth and wouldn't know what a fact was if it bit her in the behind.I would encourage everyone that has time to waste to read this book...If you can't see through this nonsense, I would seriously suggest that you seek professional help. On a positive note....the book is still selling for about $2.00 on Amazon....simpy AMAZING...since it lacks the value of a wooden nickel. I think you get the point..."
1,Typical liberal bias,"Trudy Rubin is a Philadelphia columnist and incorrigible far-leftwinger, who has railed against the Bush administration from day one with a single-mindedness amounting to monomania. Her willful hatred of Republicans, especially Bush, is made clear by her book cover, on which she defaces the president's image, symbolically decapitating him. She and other lefties are so blinded by their partisan rage that they resort to these kinds of immature temper tantrums; it's not enough to criticize Bush, let's deface his photograph! Other examples of this silliness are evident on books by Jim Hightower (Bush defaced to look like devil) and Paul Krugman (Bush defaced to look like Frankenstein's monster).This book is unserious and pure partisan junk. If you despise Bush, conservatives, and Israel, you will love Trudy Rubin and her predictably fanatical rants. Look for thoughtful analysis elsewhere."
3,"yeah, yeah,","Gino, just find a way to release the ""Twisted Heart"" sessionswith some inciteful liner notes and i'll be happy :>)"
5,Gino is incredible,I have been an admirer and a follower of Gino Vannelli's career for over 30 years. I have seen him evolve time and time again. This new CD is just another example of the endless energy and creativity. His stage presence continues to amaze me. His voice is grows stronger with each passing year. I love this CD. I recently saw him in concert and his plans are to get back into the mainstream (per his mom's strong encouragment). I also had the pleasure of being able to speak with him. For those of you who want to critize this CD or any other....let's see if you can do better.
3,"new good, and old still good","the only thing about this cd that is bad is all the songs were not new, but Im glad for the new 6 and they are really good.they are not the old sound from the 70's but they are good .he has gone a new way on some of the new songs and they are verygood with a little twist here and there with a sound he has never done before which is good seeing this is 2006, I hope tho that he goes on tour to sapport this cd cos he would sell a lot more if he did.Is this something your need to have ? Yes!"
4,Mellow fun tunes,"Finally something new from one of my favorite artists. The new stuff is quite good, kind of jazzy and fun, but still not as great as some of my earlier favorites. Generallly upbeat, great vocals. Should be liked by most Gino fans."
5,Accurate and Fast,"Correct product and shipped in good time. Happy with service. Surprised case was not plastic, but was never stated it was old school cardboard, in any case, happy with product"
5,Gen X Classic,"Pump Up the Volume is like a 'dark-side' John Hughes flick.Also it is better then Heathers because the ending monologue is much more positive.When it comes to the Gen X flicks everyone thinks of, The Breakfast Club, Singles, Reality Bites... Pump Up the Volume deserves to be in the club. Luckily PUTV is already something of a cult classic and so shall not disappear!Also This is Christian Slaters best flick. He is so cool. He always has some hot brunette love interest too. Samantha Mathis in this one. Other flicks have had Marisa Tomei and Milla Jovovich.Even the supporting cast in this flick are good. There are a whole bunch of secondary characters and spending and evening watching PUTV and seeing Mazz, Paige, and Janie is like seeing some old friends.To top everything off PUTV has a great sound-track as well!"
4,"Ah, Teenage Years","This is a snap shot of teenage life in the 90's, but the main character has a bit more talent than the rest. Good ending, not sure what happens to him, kind of like the rest of us."
2,Weak Film.,"Viewed: 6/03, 10/05Rate: 410/05: Pump Up the Volume is a film that has no meaning and tries too hard to make the message clear. It is too juvenile and superficial. There are too much close-ups on people's faces throughout the film. Thinking that when they are listening, I am being forced to follow the steps. Spoken words of Hard Harry were useless because there are clear alternatives to combat the problem. It seems like 95%-100% of the students at that high school in this movie face the same dilemma. To me, the figure is actually much lower. Allan Moyle didn't present the conflict of the story clearly until way in the end of the film. Finally when the message was showed, it left me saying, ""That's all? That's why?"". Lacking strength in the acting department for almost everybody, only Slater did a great job of carrying on. All in all, Pump Up the Volume is not as sharp as I hoped."
2,FINDING A VOICE?,"I hated this movie. People my age (when it was released) everywhere seemed to love it. Most of my friends loved Samantha Mathis's character. She was ""strange"" but strong. She tracked down this elusive underground DJ and made him hers. She just seemed pretentious and overbearing to me. I appreciate the sentiment of the film. Christian Slater is good as the underground DJ running an independent radio station, but of course, things get out of hand and his advice triggers some rather unfortunate events. The escalation of events is so unrealistic and silly, though, that I have to wonder about why this was so popular. I guess it was popular with young people because they like to feel like they have power or a voice. Or they like to be portrayed as though they do. But you never hear about anything like this-on this scale-in real life."
5,happy hary rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I first saw this movie MASTERPEICE when it first came out on video and I thought it was on a level all its one. If Icould sum it up in jus one statment Iwould say ""I KNOW YOU NOT YOUR NAME BUT YOUR GAME"" I loved it!! and I think everyone will hold a place in their mind for the ""EAT ME BEAT ME LADY"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,COOL FLICK,"This rocks!!! Well acted, Good Sound Track and the one thing I also love is it has that 80's feel even though it came out in the early 90's. My favorite thing is at the time there was nothing like it!!!"
4,This movie is great ...... TALK HARD,"This movie in my opinion is Christians best, if your looking for something different to watch try this one on for size, great cameos of now famous stars --- Seth Green , Juliet Landau and others........ TALK HARD"
4,Solid teen film,"The Bottom Line:Something of a cult classic, this film about a meek high school student who runs an illegal radio station after hours is not a great movie but it's a cut above the standard teen angst film and is a better use of your time than the more acclaimed Heathers.3/4"
5,"Great book, everyday cooking for people who love pasta","Simple, straight-forward, most recipes have few ingredients, you can cook most of them quicker than you can make one of those frozen pasta dishes in a bag. I have prepared many of them and they are really wonderful, the people you cook them for will think you spent all day cooking for them"
5,Read on a full stomach!,"Make sure you are not hungry when you peruse these recipes! They are easy to make -- and oh so good. The ingredients are readily available -- even living in a foreign country. The extra info on which sauce works best with which noodle type is a nice plus. If you love pasta, this is THE book to have on your shelf. The ideas on how to stock basic ingredients in your pantry make assembly quick and economical. With the variety of sauce recipes you can eat pasta every other night. Remember though -- don't read on an empty stomach!"
5,Great Album,"WIll Johnson is the singer/songwriter for the Denton, TX band centro-matic. This guy is a songwriting machine. I saw them open for Tripping Daisy in Little Rock in 1999 and they blew me away. They've released around 6 or 7 cd's in just 4 years! This cd is really beautiful. Also, do yourself a huge favor and buy centro-matic ""navigational"". In my opinion, it is a masterpiece."
2,feel like an old Lincoln Towncar!,"These shocks are horrible! I thought I would try these from a well known manufacturer (KYB)to replace worn out Rancho 5000's. God, what a mistake! The body roll I experienced was WORSE than the worn out Rancho's! Brake dive was the same! I was so disappointed with these shocks that I ended up taking them off and purchasing a new set of Rancho 5000's. These may ride like OEM for some vehicles, but we all know OEM is not always a good thing. If you want your vehicle to ride like an '88 Lincoln Towncar, then these are a cheap option. But if you want something with stability and a little more firmness (but not harsh) spend the little extra for the Rancho's or ProComp's. I gave these 2 stars because they were not defective, looked like a quality product, and yes are a monotube design."
5,Essays by Voinovich,"If we need any reminders why the government of the Soviet Union fell, Vladimir Voinovich is here with a mordant collection of observations about a wretched system that rubbed along for decades."
4,Encyclopedia of Batik Designs,I would like to make this book to be one of my references in computer batik design.
3,Lost in Translation,"This CD is an interesting illustration of the difficulties some music has when jumping genres. As a U2 fan with a collector's personality I am not unhappy to have this CD on my shelf but it only rarely comes down and usually only to ask someone to ""name that tune.""Some of the songs on this CD cross over relatively well (Sunday Bloody Sunday) but others are simply painful to hear (Desire) and for that reason I give this CD 2.5 stars. Technically good but artistically lacking."
1,Credit Derivatives,"This book has nothing new in spite of being released in 2003. Many key issues receive inadequate explanations, and the sections written by different authors do not merge well. If you have no experience with the market, this is not a good book to start you off. If you have experience with the market, there is no reason to buy this book."
1,BOOOORING,Mark Anson manages to write one of the most horrible books about derivatives. Mr.Anson's ideas are dated and wouldn't be much help to anyone. I feel sorry for the CalPERS fund if this is the brainpower they have running it.
3,Get A Real Review Book Instead,"This book is great for quizzing you so you know what subjects to brush up on. THe CD can also get you used to the CAT format. But having taken the NAPLEX after using this book and several others, you will never see these questions on the NAPLEX. The chances of seeing the same question is almost zilch. Its better to know your key subjects well (HTN, DM, HIV, etc) then learn facts here and there about everything. That's what this book does for you. Its a compilation of specific questions. I recommend a review book such as APHA's Comprehensive Pharmacy Review, or Kaplans Naplex review instead."
4,A great book to study for the Boards,"The questions in this book might not necessarily be the same questions on the NAPLEX, but they get your mind in exam mode. My recommendation would be to use this book+Pharmacology (by Lippencott) and study for 2 months prior to your exam. Go through this book by section, answer the questions, and review ALL the wrong and right answers (they are provided). The questions are nicely organized and the CD was extremely helpful. If I had to the the ""Boards"" again, I would use this book to study. It provides a ton of useful information and the questions are very good. I highly recommend this book."
2,"Not a word of it is true, for entertainment purposes only","The premise of this series is horrible. The authors have taken a seemingly tragic situation (a missing Alice Brown) then lure readers by telling them the first book is a word-for-word account of Tom Sinclair's diary and how Tom is pleading everyone for help (including the reader) to find Alice -his girlfriend. The authors claim they discovered his online journal while surfing the internet. There is also a website that accompanies this whole farce which includes excerpts of both Alice's and Tom's diary, an evidence file, etc.The authors should have the decency to include a disclaimer. I don't think it is ethical for authors to claim they have a real-life journal and then plea for help in finding a fictitious character."
3,Fake and misleading but entertaining,"The only way I could tell it was all a fake was by the copyright page (it's classified as ""Fiction."") OK that is smarmy enough, but even more annoying is that NOWHERE is it listed as a series, as in book one of four. I wouldn't have picked it up then, as I usually avoid series books ... and now, darn it I am hooked! I only hope it doesn't turn into some evangelical gimmick. I feel like I'm being sucked into something that's on the edge of unethical, but the writing is very good and the storyline is suspenseful."
4,"A Theologian Writes for the ""Typical"" American Christian","This is the fourth book I've read by Robert McAfee Brown. I've already ordered a fifth. Brown is a theologian who writes not for other theologians but for the interested Christian reader. His theologizing is quite practical. This book is a good example of that as he discusses what of the Christian's allegiance belongs to God and what belongs to the State. This is an issue that most American Christians seem all to willing to take a pass on. After all, if ours is a Christian nation what contradiction can there possibly be? Well, take up and read. I never had the opportunity to meet the author, who is now deceased, but I've grown to respect him even if I do not agree at all points. If it is possible for integrity to filter through ink on paper Brown's certainly does."
5,Optimism Rules!,"A very comprehensive and readable book....I think this is must read for anyone in management or a leadership role. Perkins points out the importance of optimism (and how to develop it) balanced by a good sense of reality in leadership roles and team environments.This get's my version of the ""Two Thumbs Up"": 5 Stars."
4,Insightful!,"When British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton was busy saving his crew after a shipwreck in the Antarctic in 1914, you would guess that he wasn't thinking much about teaching leadership lessons. But author Dennis N.T. Perkins uses Shackleton's expedition to show how the leadership principles the explorer exercised can be applied to your work. He even adds modern case studies as illustration. This excellent book is at its best when it describes Shackleton's courageous rescue. He led his men to safety through a frozen wilderness by focusing on the ultimate goal of survival, setting a personal example, overcoming conflict, minimizing status differences, stressing teamwork and applying other essential leadership qualities. Though the principles may sound familiar, the book provides a dramatic new view of them, and it is written in a clear, crisp style. We at getAbstract.com recommend it to all corporate explorers."
2,Did not need for GPS to input coordinates,Many GPS these days will allow you to type in GPS coordinates directly into the GPS without the need for this equipment. Product works fine however not needed for my GPS.
2,Does not work with Mac OS X,"I purchased this because other reviewers said it worked with Mac OS X by downloading the PL2303 driver. However, the cable that I received uses a newer CH341 chip, and there are no Mac OS X drivers for that chip. It works in a borrowed Windows machine."
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"I would not get this if you have Windows 7. The product line says it is supported by Windows 7, but the supplied drivers only go through XP and Vista. Doing an internet search quickly turns up other unhappy customers with this problem - there do not seem to be any drivers out there for this product with Windows 7, at least none that work for me or many others. Hope this saves others the frustration I had to put up with."
3,Does not work on 64-bit Vista,"Just a warning that while this is probably a fine product, it will not work with 64-bit OS. There are no drivers for 64-bit Vista OS for this (or any other serial to USB adapter) yet."
2,Does not work with 64-bit Windows 7,"Works fine on a different PC running XP, but isn't recognized in the 64-bit version of Windows 7 that I'm running on my Core i7 desktop machine."
1,Doesn't work,My computer running Windows 7 simply can't find the GPS trying any of several install methods.
2,USB to Serial - Garmin Compatible,"I installed the driver that came with the adaptor and plugged my Garmin in to download maps. The computer did not find the GPS. Perhaps it is the Windows 7 operating system, the drivers, but my old computer has a serial port that I can use."
1,Great - for a pre-2007 desktop Mac,"I bought this cable so I could use a Garmin GPS with my MacBook Pro. Not so much.If you have a slot-loading (as opposed to a tray that comes out) CD/DVD drive, forget about installing the drivers from the 3 inch disk that comes with this. If you manage to find the drivers online, they don't do the trick on the newer OSX.I ended hooking up the Garmin eTrex Legend GPS to the serial port of a very old PC to update the device (negating the need for this cable altogether). Hardware is usually only as good as the driver that enables it. Still running Windows XP on a PC? Works fine.Mac user (with this GPS)? Forget it."
2,An unfortunate edition,"This excellent, basic cookbook has the misfortune, in this recent edition, of being saddled with an unfortunate introduction, which detracts from the basic beauty of the original. I will stick to the earlier version."
5,"A ""must have"" DVD","This is a ""must have"" DVD for anyone who's enjoyed The Knack or wondered how they got their start and what has happened to them. It answers questions that all fans have asked."
3,Pretty darn good,"""getting the Knack"" tells you everything you need to know about those magical months when The Knack ruled the airwaves. These guys were litterally everywhere in 1978--80. And it's no wonder the band's first album is as good as power pop ever got. Feiger's head expands to gigantic proportions as the band's popularity increases. And for good reason, the first album was REALLY that good, and Feiger was, for the most part, the main reason. There's lots of nice amateaur video footage, and plenty of television footage of the band at various points during their ride. There is also plenty of first hand discussion from band members and insiders too. All in all it's much better than expected considering the band's image, today, is barely a blip on the radar."
2,Barely Commentary.,"This is far from a critical commentary on judges. It might be okay for a bible study, but I think it makes a claim to a level of scholarship that it does not live up too. Pastors beware!!! this was a waste of money."
3,Early works,"Good overview of Sacha's work but didn't contain the French version of ""I Wish You Love"" ....which I always felt was a great tune."
3,too basic,this is good book for total dummies but too basic if u know a even little bit about cars. Not enough pictures either
2,Dies...a lot,"Had this comp in house for around five years, in that span it has died 2 times. Its a common issue with this comp to have motherboard issues, and due to its unique proprietary design you cant just replace the board. I have been able to bring it back both times with different techniques such as heating the igp *intergrated graphics* Then replacing memory. This is an old system already if you happen on a good working one it is a nice system, very nice case with great room/cooling. However the board layout is bad and takes a lot of work. Good luck to anyone with one of these its on a 50/50 chance it will be bad."
2,From Back Cover,"Sheikh Haroun al Muntazir was honor-bound to recover a priceless family jewel...but what was lovely operative Mariel de Vouvray's mission? Until her motives were made plain, he had to keep her close--yet at a distance. But with one stolen kiss Haroun's resistance turned to air. Was Mariel's melting surrender a trap of ultimate danger...or a precious haven offered by his future beloved wife?2nd in the Sons of the Desert: The Sultans series"
4,4 stars because I love Ms. Sellers,"The book was not that great I found myself skimming it to the point where I skipped pages. The beginning was good when the hero and heroine meet it was exciting, but it seemed to just DDDDDDDDRRRRRRAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGG, when you hit the middle and the end was just okay we've come to the end of this book. It might have just been me, I had been waiting for the book ever since she started the series again. There was not a love scene until the end when everything about everyone was solved and I find that rather boring. Still I can't wait for the next book in the installment."
5,"Ratzo is a great book, it showed me the dangers of racing",I loved the book Ratzo because I have a greyhound and I never knew how bad racing can be. Marty Crisp really opened my eyes to the dangers of greyhound racing. I encourage you to read this book because it is exciting and teaches you a lot.
5,ABUSE AND COMPASSION,"This well-written coming-of-age story helps young people see how compassion should move toward correcting an abuse - however much pain and struggle may result for the person who is attempting to change things. Leaning on the wisdom of his grandfather and his own love for dogs, Josh courageously does what he must do and ends the story stronger and happier than he started it. This book is a great read and an ultimately life-changing one!"
1,Other books on greyhound racing,"This book only offers one very narrow view of greyhound racing. For critical balance I highly recommend the brilliant 'Man Buys Dog: a loser's guide to greyhound racing' (available from amazon.co.uk) by David Matthews. It's incredibily funny, insightful and moving, and gives a warts and all portrait of the sport. 'When West Ham Went to the Dogs' is also worth a look."
3,A littie disappointed,"Works as advertised, however, I have to manually reset with on/off switch every time I start up the unit. Also leads on supplied cable are too short to reach tv and sound system amplifier."
4,Works as advertised.,"Tvisto works exactly as advertised. The setup is straight forward - install IDE hard drive, create folders in the hard drive, then add content to each folder. I only use it to store movies. Tvisto is a great way for you to transport all your and your child's favorite movies when your travelling or just going to grandma's house."
3,OK device,"The device is OK. I have it connected through the S-video for the video portion. This device is not compatible with all digital formats. Many in the higher quality video is not supported. (Very frustrating) There are others that work will all digital video formats. I'd look into them. Maybe a couple dollars more, but not significant."
3,Does the job but flammable.,"I loved this product until it caught fire. I ordered it to keep the police off my property, and it worked - nobody was trespassing down my country road and it was great, until one day I turned around to give my baby a bath, and when I looked around again this was on fire. I had to throw it in the bathtub to put it out. Unfortunately, it smacked my baby upside the head when I threw it into the tub and I had to take it to hospital. The baby, that is."
4,Very informative,The illustrations help a lot. This book is great for club and lower college coaches who can't/ don't have a paid trainer for their program. It is very informative and will help condition to build up your program.
2,good but can be better,The idea of the book is good but the value of the book will further more increase if there were photo's and drawings illustrating how to execute the exercise. Only the explanation is not sufficient it might be difficult to understand
5,Sony and Only,"I am not a expert on Personal Computers by all means. This is just one opinion of many out there and Sony did not endorse me ( now that would be sweet ).Awesome Screen.Brightness of the screen is whoaa !!!. Good Battery. Simple and efficient keyboard .Very quick response time on most applications. Since I just got it I might have some additional inputs and thoughts in the future (but then again I do not want to bore people with my blah,blah).Price could have been better but again I compared it with some HP and Toshiba's and I went with this choice. For me Clarity of the Screen was important since i do lot of Account Presentations and Hypos for my Clients and Prospective Clients so 17"" Screen helps also when on the road.I hope it helps some folks with decision which way to go.See you."
3,Not for do-it-yourself jobs,"This is a guide to help a person to chose a contractor to redo their basement. It explains very well what causes the problems and also the possible solutions. However, they are all expensive solutions. The book seems to presuppose that you have 6000 or more $ to spend and that you have a major problem. For minor problems, it does not explain how to do things yourself (which is what I was looking for). I suppose I bought the wrong book."
5,Worth every penny!,Excellent handbook with thorough descriptions of how waterproofing should be done. This information helps tremendously for the layman homeowner who may not know if their contractor is telling them the correct remedy or just trying to sell them their particular waterproofing system. The part where you really get the value for your money is that the author provides his e-mail address in the book and very promptly answers e-mails regarding your own personal waterproofing situation. You cannot place a price tag on this type of honest unbiased advice when you are about to make an investment of thousands of dollars!
2,"Great homeowner's guide, but not for professionals","This book is sincerely written, but it is presented with the complete novice in mind. It's more like a softcover booklet, and written in an informal collaquial style.I did, however, notice there are some factual errors in text(a layer of gravel by itself is not a 'vapor barrier'), so I would suggest that anyone looking for a more serious technical manual would be better off buying a $90 construction textbook instead."
2,Presented no 'new' ideas,"As a senior homeowner/maintainer, I found the basement handbook just a compilation of ideas well known by me.Probably a good book for newcomers..."
5,Great American Made Product,"Very high quality, My GF needed for her Salon....she had bought a cheap one from a big box office supply....it was junk....so flimsy it would not have lasted a week. This lamp is very rugged....and while primary usage seems to be for machine shop....has a very sleek, modern look."
5,Snake-Arm Light,Expensive but well built lamp. I recommend ordering with the optional guard to protect the bulb. There are several styles available.
1,Didn't work,"I wrangled it out of the box, wrestled to get the plastic wrapping off, fidgeted with the enclosed wrench which was too tight of a fit, found a lightbulb, plugged it in, flipped the switch, and... nothing.I tried several lightbulbs and several different outlets. Nothing.Now have to wrangle it back in the box, wrap the box, go to the post office, pay to have it shipped back and hopefully get my money back - minus the shipping costs. Bah."
1,Does not work for me,"I bought this lamp based on the favorable reviews and have just tossed it in the trash. The neck is so stiff it takes strength and two hands to adjust it. It is not as flexible as it claims and is difficult to ""aim"" the light.The clamp base is much too narrow to support the weight of the lamp and stiff neck so that when adjusting it, the clamp slips and comes off its perch. It just fell to the floor, again!, and broke a new bulb.I'll find a cheaper lamp that is more cooperative."
2,Maze of unsorted facts,"The book is good scholarship in that it presents a myriad of facts about a myriad of organizations and movements. However, it is also extremely bad scholarship in that the author is unable to make sense of his own research. The extensive facts become a cluttered maze, a complex puzzle the author is unable to fit together. The book is a good historical reference, but otherwise an a-theoretical work that offers little insight. The author would do well to reach out and read the work of others who apply a more analytical perspective to similar material. I am not trying to be insulting, but he seems to have no comprehension of the history he reports."
3,Used for an Art Project,This project definitely requires adult supervision and attention to detail. I had some problems with the molding material - was never able to get the lumps out of it - detail of the final project was impacted by the quality of the molding material.
1,Word of caution!!,"What are you teaching your 8 year old if you buy him this?? This is a sick toy, just look at it. Sure, kids think it's great but it's your job to do what is best for them because they don't always know what is best."
4,A very practical guide for setting up shop,The book takes a novice from zero knowledge about what to buy to the professional and what the author feels he or she should have in their arsenal of tools. it does not go into how to use them nor does it spend a lot of time on projects (a few shop projects are included). But it does give the beginner or novice/hobbyist the necessary information to buy the right tool. use it as a guide and not the authoritative word. overall it was helpful but all those sears craftsman products in it makes me wonder about the author whose shop on the cover has not one sears tool in it.
4,Very Useful,"A very informative and thought provoking book. I would highly recommend it to anyone contemplating construction of a ""new"" workshop of almost any type. I would recommend including it in the reference section of any woodworkers library."
5,The Best Road Book Since Euricledes' Appian Way,"Steve Rushin writes in a fever, like a sports-mad monologist trying to get in the last word with himself. His style has the heat and bite of great gossip, and his thinking makes it literature. Rushin's prose has a breezy, confidential rhythm that pulls us right into his head. A scary thought, that, but a richly rewarding one."
3,Good for the trivia sports fan,It was an easy read but probably limited to people who are very familiar with sports trivia. It would not be very entertaining for the non sporting crowd. I found it to be a book of which one can read a few essays then put it down for a while before picking it up again...not exactly a page-turner. I am a sports fan and could relate personally to many of the essays and therefore enjoyed it.
4,candle crations ...,"candle creations is a fun, safe way to make candles, it is made of tiny wax balls that melt when you light the candle. it is very safe, no melting required it is a gift for anyone, any occasion"
2,Not exactly what I expected,"My daughter received this as a gift and was really excited to try it. The product is made with little wax balls that stick to everything. It was difficult to get them into the little votives without spilling and they're hard to clean up. If you get this, make sure your table is well covered with newspaper. I was also disappointed because you have to keep the little votive in a container of water whenever you light it because it gets too hot. It could just be used as a decoration and not a candle, but you'd want to put it somewhere where it won't get knocked over because the wax would be a big mess."
5,Excellent,This toy toy was very fun. I had a great time making the candles and they burned well too.
2,Nothing special,"I'd hoped for more from this book, but sadly I've read a few titles that were so similar. Nothing new here. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't new."
2,very disappointing,"I am quite curious about Rai and have seen Cheb Khaled live so there's that. This CD though did not blow me away. It all seemed to much the same. I'd sooner listen to bellydance music to be honest.The Rough Guide packaging, as usual, is first rate."
2,Basic Info that Can be Found on the Net,"Much of this book is page filler, it advocates Glucosomine and Chondrodin Sulphate as its main ""cure"" and then talks about eating foods high in antioxidants (which is really old basic info that we can find in plenty of books and websites). It is also very repetative, I remember reading the same subject three times near the beginning (page filler.)Although the book is helpful, especially for really ignorant newbies who hate the internet, it needs to be thinned out and the common knowledge parts taken out."
1,Title is misleading...,"As someone with severe osteoarthritis (and a fused foot at 18), I find this book very annoying not because glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate were and are not an option for me, but simply because it is basically junk food for the masses. I have friends who have had success with glucosamine and chondroitin, and others who have not. I hate to say it, but most people with arthritis (and especially osteoarthritis) are not willing to do what it takes to manage the disease--using common sense (which does not seem to be so common)by eating a healthy diet, losing excess weight, and exercise. Be open and honest with your doctor and family about your disease! If something isn't working, make it known! Most importantly, good self-esteem, perseverance, and a desire to succeed will do more for most people than any supplement, NSAID, hyaluronic acid injection, etc. Overall, I think one will accomplish more by using common sense and communication than reading this book."
2,The Arthritis 'Cure' -- Hype With Little / No Substance,"The Arthritis 'Cure' -- LOTS of Hype With Little / No Substance (Presented)This book has a (gross) overabundance of (unsubstantiated) hype & little / no substance. It is a true 'Reader's Digest' / National Enquirer special with the shallowest possible pretext at documentation. Whether or not there is (some) substance to the use of glucosamine sulfate or chondroitin sulfate, one will get little more than lot of handwaiving & gospelizing from this 'work'. Other reviews posted re this book detailed other shortcomings / aspects well enough that they need not be repeated here..."
5,The Arthritis Cure : The Medical Miracle,"I injured my knee around Labor Day and four months later I had minimal results with physical therapy and NSAIDs. My once active life had stopped, every activity I tried, even walking, aggravated my knee. I started on the Glucosomine and Chondrodin Sulphate program along with the vitamin supplements outlined in the book and had great results. After just a few weeks, I am able to hike and workout again. I feel better than I have in months! I know several friends on Glucosomine, but I felt better with the book outlining the dosage and other vitamins to compliment. I have not needed any NSAIDs since I started this therapy. I like that this program has almost no side effects and can help my injury without surgery. Try it for yourself, what do you have to lose but the pain?"
5,I tried it and it worked!,"I was stunned to find that it actually helped me. I have suffered from knee pain since I was in my teens. Mostly the result of running and playing basketball which wore down the cartilage. Long walks, flights and even going to watch a film were painful events until I read this book and tried it."
4,A long winded explanation of mathematical tricks.,Interesting material and well writen. People with strong mathematic skills will speed through this book.
1,The Book of Darkness,"My classmates and I are being subjected to this book this semester. We refer to it as ""The Book of Darkness"" for two reasons: 1) it's intensely painful to read, 2) even after you've invested the time to try to read it, you are just as much in the dark as you were before. It's up there with one of the worst text books I've ever had to spend money on."
3,Self Help guide for IBS,"Another self-help guide for IBS, colitis, and other digestive problems. This book, written by an M.D. that suffers from colitis, describes dietary approaches based on his personal experiences. His thesis is based on the inability of some people's digestive systems to properly digest fructose, found in many foods and drinks"
5,cynical sing-a-long fun for all,"""im just a humble corporate slave drivin myself into a corporate grave"""
3,A fun way to learn.,"I got this for my 3 year old. I think he's just a little bit young for this one. He ejoys messing with it, but it is not his favorite. Most of it is too hard. The 'Let's Write!' section is great, you get to either trace or freehand the letters in upper or lower case and it says their names. I think he will get a lot of use out of this when he gets a little older."
5,Did you remember to calibrate it??,"If it is not responding to your writting on it, check the instructions, you must calibrate the Pixter before you can start using it. Warning: Never get your Pixter screen the slightest bit wet, the screen will no longer work properly."
4,My 4 year old loves it!,"I have an older son who is 8 and his little brother always wants to play with his GBA. He's a little young for it and so in came Pixter! Boy, does he love it. I only wish I would have bought the one with the light. It wasn't around when I bought his but he does enjoy it very much. Even I do."
2,Do Not Buy This Book,"Unless you have more money than you know what to do with or you must have every book on Eakins do not waste you time on this book. It is supposed to be a survey of Eakins drawing, painting and photography of the male nude. There are three so called drawings, two white forms that are supposed to be knees, a scribbled thumbnail sketch for a painting that is not reproduced and one small drawing of a figure. There are only a few paintings, most of which we have seen reproduced better elsewhere. Most of the blurry photographs are not even identifies as by Eakins; in fact some include him in them so could not have been taken by him (although they may have been set up by him?).What a wasted opportunity to do a comprehensive survey of a great artist's work; an opportunity to compare the three media and how he used the photos and drawings to develop the major works. Even a good survey of the drawings and paintings would have been more interesting and useful."
3,Hummer Stuff,I needed something to protect the carpet in the back of my Hummer and ordered this item. It is just what I needed but the liner is not exactly what I expected. I thought it would have been a little thicker around the edges but it is a thinner material than what I wanted. It will work for what I need.
4,"Good goggles, but lasting effect on the face...","These goggles are as good as the Vanquisher, and the seal is maybe a little better and more comfortable. However, and this may just be my own experience, the neoprene gaskets leave little indented rings around my eyes which stay there a bit longer than do the standard rubber-seal goggles. Personally, when I buy new ones, I will go back to the Vanquisher. But I can't imagine switching brands - the Speedo goggles are great, comfortable, and seal well, and most of all they are very clear... for a while, at least. I am not sure how to keep them clear/fogless more than about 3-4 months, and whenever I get a new pair, it's like the underside of the pool has been cleaned!"
4,Good fit for petite face,"This goggle works well for a petite female face. I don't know that these would work for someone who is larger in size. The foam makes for a comfortable fit but be warned-- you will still get ""racoon"" eyes if you swim more than 20 minutes. However, the lines seem to fade fairly quickly. As for the seal, it's decent but if you intend to dive into the pool with these on, I would not recommend them. Overall, a great buy given the price."
1,Fog thicker than pea soup,"Out of the box, and on to my head with great care not to touch the lenses. I rinsed off before swimming. After I entered the water I pulled them down they were already fogged up. By the time I got to the end of the 25 meter pool I could barely see where I was going. At the end of every lap I have to take them off, rinse them, and then put them back on. Yet, they fog up every time. I have to repeat after every lap."
1,Incomprehensible Gibberish,"This book was written by a statistician for other statisicians only. The conclusions reached by the author are better known by any informed baseball fan. His unique calculations show (to him) that Fred McGriff is a better hitter than Al Kaline, Harry Stovey better than Tony Gwynn and Joe Jackson, and Dolph Camilli better than Roberto Clemente. This book is a classic illustration of Mark Twain's saying:""There are 3 types of lies: lies, D___ Lies, and statistics."""
5,AMAZING,"This concert is INCREDIBLE, and the footage is superb. The quality is amazing, and I love the behind the scenes bits. The mix of other great artists with Celine Dion is just perfect. One of her best concert DVDs ever released."
3,Nothing special,The map is just not detailed enough. But do give you a reasonably idea of the biggest roads in Central America. And there is no distance calculator between major city's.
5,History isn't that boring,"I think this is a really good book because mostly when you look at history it's boring and you don't want to know about it. I gave five stars handds down. The reason is because it shows that we shouldn't take freedom for granted. In this book a young boy named Creighton is a little piece of crap that nobody would want for a son. That's why his mom sent him to be with his uncle in the American colonies. creighton's uncle sends him to spy on Benjamin Franklin, the legendary printer, to learn about the rebels. I thought this book was put together well and I enjoyed it. An element that is represented most in this story is suspense. I kept thinking is Creighton going to get caught? I would recommend this book to people who always think What if?"
2,Don't read it,The Year of the Hangman is a story about what would have happened had Great Britain won the American Revolution. It is based in the year 1777 and is about a 15 year old English boy named Creighton.I was overall not satisfied. The story did not pick up until half way through the novel. It got very confusing and jumbled at parts. It did not spend enough time describing a good mental image of the characters. The ending was not in any way satisfying. It seems like Mr. Blackwood decided to just put down his pen and send the book to the publishers. I would not suggest this book for anyone.
3,an ok book,When the boy gets kidnapped the story picks up. The British would not have won the war. I rate this book 3 stars.the boy gets kiddnaped by american soldgers he is taken to New Orlans. His uncle that was with him was a cournal in the britain army. I recomend this book to people who like realistic fiction.
3,A good book but boring at times.,"This book is about a young boy who lives in England with his mother. His mother has him basically kidnapped to go to America and live with his mother. He doesn't like America at all and goes through plenty of hardships. He has to get through a lot of promblems and do things he never thought he would do.He has to break his uncle and friend out of jail and even act as a spy for them.So basically it is what life in America would be like if the French would of won the war instead of the Americans. So if you like history, action, and adventure this is the book for you."
2,The Year of the Hangman,"I am a middle school librarian who enjoys reading historical fiction. While this novel was well written (and the book jacket did state it was a alternative history of our revolution) I found it very confusing. I'm concerned some students may believe this book is, like other historical novels they've read, based upon fact,when it is not. This could lead those not familiar with our past to believe erroneous facts about American history (i.e. Jefferson lost his family to drowning; Franklin died in New Orleans; Benedict Arnold was not a traitor)."
2,Year of the Hangman Review,"The Year of the Hangman by Gary Blackwood is about a boy who was kidnapped from England and brought to the colonies. He had no respect for the Americans because he viewed hem as traitors, but even Creighton begins to become a traitor. He spies on Benjamin Franklin and gives the British information but he is left behind. He Begins to side with the American colonists and begins to help them.This book is slow at parts but interesting to see the Revoulutionary War the other way around. It had good action and suspense which at parts that left me wondering. It really got me to think about how different things would be if the colonists lost.I recommend this book to people who enjoy learning about American history."
2,Boring Read,"The Year of the Hangman by Gary Blackwood is a book that is set in an alternate historical fiction genre. The story is about a fifteen year-old boy named Creighton who is sent to America to become ""reformed"". Through this experience, he moves down to Florida and eventually to New Orleans where he meets up with Ben Franklin, who publishes two newspapers. Creighton is lured into working for Franklin (publishing the newspapers) through a loss of a card game. Throughout the story, he becomes unsure of where his loyalties lie; with his uncle and the British, or with the Americans and Franklin.Overall the plot is easy to follow, but it can be slow at times, and very boring.I would not recommend The Year of the Hangman by Gary Blackwood."
4,The year of the hangman,"The main Character in the story The Year of the hangman is Creighton Brown and he does the right thing after he gets kidnapped and taken aboard the British ships. Because he does not get himself killed like the captain George Washington of the American army gets hung by the end of a giblet. Also in the story the power full British Red coats soundly defeated the American army. (But really the Americans defeated the British red coats.)During the war Creighton was on the boat with the British. Creighton is a young man, he still goes to school, and Creighton is a playmaker for the school and director for the plays. Creighton Brown finally got to see his parents on the boat after he talked to the captain and he told Mr.Brown that Creighton was aboard the ship."
2,The only History Book that put me to Sleep,"I give this book two stars because i love reading history books, but the print is tiny and it put me to sleep. I tried reading it and had to finish it for school, but it was more boring than my text book. It starts off pretty boring, and starts to get better, but then it's over. I wouldn't suggest it."
3,Year of Great Plots,"The Year of the Hangman had a great plot. It was a really interesting idea to reverse the outcome of the Revolutionary War. But at some parts it was hard to follow. He used big words and you really couldn't follow what was happening sometimes. It was cool how he put it in a different perspective from England in the Revolutionary War. It does feel like you're in that time period.The characters weren't described well. For the main character, all he really said about him was that he was 15. I never got to feel like I knew him. There were other characters like Ben Franklin and Franklin's adopted child, Sophie, that hardly got explained at all.The main themes were of loyalty and friendship. This is a great ""what if"" adventure - Creighton has to find who he is loyal to - the British or Americans. But the ending was a bit fast.All in all, this book is good with a few flaws. I would recommend it to people who like history."
2,Hard to buy storyline...,"This was my first reading of a ""alternative history"" book. Maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it all that much. The year is 1777, and Creighton Brown is a English lad who often drives his mother crazy with his antics. Eventually, he ends up in America, which is still ruled by England, since the colonists lost the war. He is to live with his horrible uncle, but many twists and turns lead him to meet historical figures and find out where his loyalties lie. I wish the author had included a little more about the characters, and Creighton had spent more time in England."
3,Student,"I read this book for a revolutionary novel project, and over all, it is very fascinating, if you don't already know, this book is about a boy who gets kidnapped and taken to America, and he stays at benjamin franklin's home. The book takes place in 1777 after the revolutionary war, and it is what would happen if the Americans lost. This is an okay book, although, it seemed the most interesting out of the ones the teacher offered. It is a good book to read IF YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. This is not real history. There are a lot of true parts (the auther explains in the back of the book) but the mass majority if completely fake. You go half way through the book before the story get going. Over all, if you want an OKAY book of what could have happened, this would be the book for you."
5,Excellent,"I watched the DVD and then ordered a copy for my dad and another hunter that has success with calling. This video teaches how, when, and how loud to use snort, grunt, blat, and bleat calls. He gives 3-4 variations of each type of call. There are some good hunts on the DVD and Peter also uses rattling on one of the hunts. Great DVD. He teaches how to make some of the calls with just your mouth instead of a call. I got the tip to look for Peter Fiduccia's information inside Hal Blood's ""Hunting Big Woods Bucks"" two books."
5,An exciting book presented modestly by the man who lived every minute of it by the man who lived it,"Gen. Howard was an amazing yet modest man, a man who quietly, modestly, and politely routinely did great things. Knowing him personally as a young employee in his new company in the early 1960's is something I look back on as a great experience of my early adulthood. Observing him in his calm, confident, and courteous demeanor was in itself, a privilege. All of this ""matter of fact"" approach to life is obvious on every page."
5,Save a bundle,"Pay attention to what you are buying. A friend with a pellet stove was gripping about paying the dealer $326 + tax for a new blower and how he had to wait till payday. I googled the motor, and some research and found it to be a cheap noisy knock off of this motor. I bought it for him and (of course he paid me cash) after he installed it, all he could talk about (ad nauseum) was how quiet it is, and how Amazon saved him hundreds of $$. Also, it has oiler ports for lubrication, and this sent him to heaven. Guess it was a good buy."
2,bloopers?,"I always thought the definition of bloopers was something that went ""wrong"" while filming. On this DVD there is very little of that. What we get most are collections of rare clips that most have already been shown through other Real World You Never Saw DVDs. Nothing really that new here. Puck seems very tame here as the host as he talks with some random people about what their favorite things that the Real Worlders have done (most of the bonus ""bloopers"" are of Puck while they were taping him for this DVD/Video). Even though the other ""You Never Saw"" DVDs were lacking, I still found them enjoyable. This DVD, however, is the weakest of the bunch, and offered very little new entertainment."
2,"I would have to agree with everyone, very little to watch!","yep, this dvd is all about puck being himself. I was tired of watching that years ago. anyhow, this dvd just shows stuff that everyone else saw a million times already. If you have bought any of the other behind the scenes videos you already have most of this material. its like they didn;t even include whole seasons on this dvd. Where are the bloopers. whatever. skip it."
2,The Real World You've Already Seen,"For all the real Real World Fans...you have already seen this DVD... This video is a collaboration of The Real World You Never Saw Hawaii, New Orleans, Chicago, and Back to New York. There are a few clips from other specials, but for the most part, there is nothing new here. There are a few bloopers (not the tripping and tongue twisters you expected) most of them of Puck. Puck doesn't really host the show, but asks people on the street what their favorite body function is or what their favorite real world moment was. Puck isn't the obnoxious, unpredictable person he used to be, and has grown up quite a bit."
3,how hot is it?,"Red (in color)hot, but a bit hard to understand as the small buttons all multi-task, and small they are, with smaller still labels.Once figured out though, it does it's job well."
1,Cheap (made anyway),"I just purchased one of these, placed brand new batteries into it (yes they were inserted correctly) and started my smoker up. I went back to look a few minutes later and the unit was no longer on. I press the taste button and it turns back on.. but for only like 5 minutes then it tuns itself off again. The instruction manual (the part in English anyway) does not mention an auto off feature or a way to keep the unit from turning itself off. This makes the unit worthless if you want it to alarm at a given temp like it is supposed to do. Defiantly skip this product and spend the extra $10.00 for something that works."
1,Inaccurate,"I have two of these, and one reads ten degrees lower than the other in the same roast all the time. Ten degrees is a pretty big difference when you're trying to achieve a particular level of doneness, so these thermometers are pretty much useless."
2,Unreliable,"I used this item for the first time on a 5 pound pork roast. I put it in the oven at 325 degrees and within 45 mins it was telling me that it was at 160 degrees ""target temperature""..............no way, no how. I checked it with a meat therometer and of course it was only 120 degrees, I hope I can return this unreliable piece of crap."
1,Probe Failure,"The probe lasted a few months before it started giving erroneous ratings. And then the probe failed. Now I'm stuck with a digital display that has no probe to measure temperatures. I have to decide if I want to buy a different brand or buy another pack of probes to replace the defective part. =( Considering all the places this gets used, it's not worth the high price if you have to replace it every 6 months."
2,"Great potential, poor product","The Taylor thermometer has some nice features, once you figure out how to use certain features, like the custom temperature alarm. However, the temperature probe is very poor quality. I'm on my second Taylor 808 - the first one was replaced by the manufacturer due to a temperature probe that stopped working. The display would read ""LLL"" all the time. The manufacturer shipped me a whole new unit as a replacement for my original purchase when the original unit's temperature probe failed in less than 6 months. I have now had the second unit for about 6 months and the temperature probe has also failed. The probe is EXTREMELY susceptible to water intrusion. If any water gets inside the metal probe, which is almost impossible to avoid, the probe will fail within weeks. The probe is a poor design, a design fault in my opinion, which was easily mitigated. I will not buy another Taylor thermometer."
1,Probe went bad,Have had the unit for about a year and the probe will suddenly read LLL (even when I hold the probe in my hand). Replaced the batteries and still cannot get the temperature to read consistently. Based on the other reviews I'm guessing the probe has gone bad. Don't buy this product. Spend a couple extra bucks on something higher quality. A Taylor device will not be my next purchase...
2,"Unrealistic, Do Not Waste Your Time And Money","Very fictional, hard to situate, jumps from one event to the next without much context. Not worth the buy."
4,Fair Flower of FolkRock,"Valerie Rose has shown that the powerful melodies in folk music of the British Isles can be mixed delightfully with rock and roll. She ain't the first, and she definitely borrows from June Tabor, Maddy Prior and company on Petals of Stone. But she is original and referential in her similarities, not an imitator. The album has 6 tunes. My wife and I, both consumers of Isles trad. arr. music of many kinds for many years, liked five of the six songs a lot. The production of the CD is good, allowing Ms. Rose' truly fine vocals to shine through. Her side-folks include the under-famous Preston Carter on bass, and solid guitar work by Phil Campbell (also the producer). One track even has Kris Yenney, one of the best cellists anywhere, particularly working outside the classical box. This brief CD has held it's spot on my turntable for a while against a lot of competition. Buy it."
5,child health journal,i work in a pediatric office. when a mother gave me this book to note the baby's height and weight i fell in love with it. i knew i had to buy one for my son and my daughter in law for their baby. one of the reasons i liked it was because mom can always carry it in her diaper bag and have all the medical information at her finger tips.
4,"A Better Intro To ""Tsotsi""-style Kwaito","For those people who've seen the movie ""Tsotsi"" and are looking for more Kwaito music, this collection is much more representative of the Kwaito sound that Zola delivers in the movie than Amazon's other Kwaito collection, ""Kwaito - South African Hip Hop"". The latter collection showcases an earlier brand of Kwaito from the mid-90s that still retained the 80's shebeen-pop sensiblities that, along with Mbaqanga, House, Rap and mulitiple township sub-genres, informed Kwaito's origins.The ""Kwaito: SA Urban Beats"" collection charts the territory that Zola currently inhabits: the Kwaito of the late 90's and early-mid naughties, with its rougher edges, more sophisticated instrumentation and greater lyrical savvy."
2,"Great work, poor edition","I highly recommend The German Ideology, but wish to warn buyers of this edition (Prometheus). The quality of the print in this edition is very low, the font is difficult to read, and the spacing is very tight. Perhaps most frustrating, however, is that the text is marked with numbers for footnotes that have no actual corresponding footnotes. I have written to the publisher three times about this issue and have received no response or explanation. The name of the translator is also suspiciously absent, and there is no introduction to the work--something that in this case would be very helpful. On the positive side, I think this edition provides the complete German Ideology, but Book One is really all that is necessary or ever referenced, and this can be found in other editions."
4,"A vital early work, but not a complete picture of Marx.","First of all, the correct title would refer to the THESES on Feuerbach, of which there are eleven. These are terse exhortations, which Marx apparently wrote out for himself as a reminder of principles, not intended for publication. They remain brilliant and challenging to readers. The rest of the volume is taken up by *excerpts* from the vast manuscript on the German Ideology, which is an uneven early work of Marx and Engels. There are brilliant passages, crucial to Marxist thought, but there's also a lot of directionless vitriol directed at now relatively unimportant thinkers.I disagree with the previous reviewer -- this is not an ideal intro to Marxism. Read the Communist Manifesto, then move on to the Eighteenth Brumaire, or this, or Capital, or the early works.And by the way, get the International Publishers edition if you can find it."
2,missing pages,"The book arrived a day early, which was great. However, 29 pages of the first chapter were ripped out by a previous owner. These 29 pages are integral to the book and I feel somewhat cheated."
3,"Good cartridge, not so educational...but fun.",I have almost all the pixter cartridges and this one though it is a good one does not get used as much as the others. It has various activities such as habitat stampers. A set of animal habitat scenes with stampers that make animal noises. Then there are different animal art games that involve drawing and completing animals. The main thing I would point out would be to watch out with this one with younger children. One of the games is a set of slider puzzles that are fairly hard to work with. Little ones would probably get frustrated without mom or dad's help. It is a good cartridge but not one of the best. But if you got an animal lovin' little one this would be great for them.
5,My kids like them. They watch often. It's a very educatinoal DVD set.,"Books on TV ~ Kids sure like that. I got the other 100 storybook set, too. I appreciate Scholastic for making these videos for children."
3,What can I say? It works.,"Its a bland little storage device. I'm not sure it has solid state memory, because whenever I access it it makes this high-pitched clicking sound. Loses a star for that, and loses another one for being so wide it would block off your other usb ports (if it weren't for the included extension cable).It works, and its probably worth the $26 bucks or so."
4,this is a MEN'S WATCH,"i ordered this thinking it was a women's watch, turned out to be men's =(that aside, the watch itself is very nice for the price. face is about 1.75 in diameter, band is .75 in wide, band is quite large though, but can be fixed by self-adjusting links, overall nice quality looking sport/dress watch, great for everyday wear, will probably use it for a gift."
3,Not bad,"In case it isn't crystal clear, yes this cap does have an adjustable Velcro strap in the back. It is lightweight and the inner lining is very comfortable.I have a big head and this fits me very well so if you have a small head it might actually be too big for you.I took away a star because the lining under the brim is not stitched in place and it looks to me like it may begin to sag with time. I took away another star because the stitching in general isn't great."
3,Well it aint that bad,"Despite the comments about ""Split Personality"" the lead off track I liked it still I thought it was good.! Then ""Hell wit ya"" couldn't get into it ""Most girls"" is a VERY *GOOD* song I could really relate with this song and that's why I like it so much.! ""There you go"" is another *GOOD* many people can relate to as well.! ""You make me sick"" the new single I like it alot to it seems though the only songs I really like though are the singles.! ""Love is such a Crazy thing"" is a good song too I liked.! But after that the album dragged on till the last two tracks ""Hiccup"" and ""Is this Love?"" Its not a bad album and Pink isn't just a fad she is very talented and I think she'll stick around for quite a while so get along for the ride now while you still can.!Cause its a bumpy road and that's the way it should be.!"
4,I wish I could give it 5 stars,"I bought it under $100 and for that price you can't complain about this product too much.The Altimeter, compass, and barometer works great. If you know how to use them. As many have said these watches will not tell you accurate data but they do help in estimating your readings. But talking about altimeter it was pretty close approximate elevation.The thermometer will not give you exact temperature if you are wearing this watch on your hand, it most probably will give you your body temperature instead of atmospheric temperature. Works well if away from body.The reason I didn't gave it the last star is its black display. Yes your concerns are true you will have tough time reading the display, especially in day. I think may be thats why they sold the black/reverse display watches under $100"
5,What else needs to be said about P21S wheel cleaner?,"It is the best there is for the job. Proper PH, won't harm the wheels, cleans thoroughly even when loaded with baked on brake dust, recommended by BMW. Outstanding product and I've been using it for about 20 years now."
2,Works but not worth the $$,"I purchased P21S for my BMW's alloy wheels after reading a positive review on the BMW forums. BMW's are known for generating huge amounts of black brake dust & grime which are difficult to remove. P21S did work, but no better than far less expensive wheel cleaners widely available at any discount store. I got basically the same results from using Simple Green, which you can buy in a gallon jug at the warehouse clubs for about $8."
3,Another Good Bible...,"Im not much of a christian, and I do not really study the bible. This version is particularly usefull if you really do want to know the history and culture behind the writings. In the beginning of the book is a readers guide that is referenced from within the text of the bible itself. Anytime there is something that may be elaborated, weather it be a piece of culture, or an explanation of the passage, it is referenced to the readers guide. Not bad for around 25 dollars."
4,Just Fine,"I was looking for a modern text with good explanations for a beginning Bible study class. This one is just fine, easy to read, with just enough commentary for beginner-to-middle experience in Bible reading. One negative is that the pages are on thin paper, but I'm doing all right with it overall."
4,The recommended Catholic Bible,"Most church authorities in America recommend the New American for those wishing to study. As with most Catholic bibles it is translated from the Greek rather than the Hebrew, even in the Old Testament. It also contains five apocryphal books that were removed by Martin Luther when he instituted Protestant reform of the Catholic Church. For a practicing Catholic, or someone who is interested in the bible in general it is a good edition, and comes in different sizes and formats. However, it does not match the poetry of the King James Version, or the Jerusalem Bible. (The Jerusalem Bible is the Catholic poetic Bible from Vatican II.) This Bible is an excellent example of scholarship."
2,Nice sweater- RUNS Small!,I like the sweater- but I am not impressed. I have a 39pd female boxer (puppy) and this just about fits her. I knew she would out grow it but I didn't expect it to be too small (now) plus she has only worn it once and the sweater all ready has a pull in it. I also purchased a fleece jacket elsewhere & that was a better buy- it fits big as it should for this size and NO pulls plus its water proof. As I said the sweater is nice but not really for doggy daily use. go with a water proof fleece jacket I don't think this was worth my money
4,Cute red sweater,I ordered this red sweater for my overweight Boston terrier for Christmas. I was surprised how nice it fit her. I ordered a size X Large it fits well in all areas it's just a little long in the back. It's perfect for the snow and when going out in low temperature weather. Also it's just so cute on her!
3,Thin material,fits fine. My dog has only worn it for 5 days and there is a hole and the strap just fell off. He hasn't been tugging or biting it either..mostly wears it supervised and not a very active dog.
3,Sizing is wrong,"The sweater is very nice. The only problem - it is not the size I expected it to be. I have a German Shep female(a pure bread which means she's rather smaller than average German Sheps), and according to the chart XXL is the size for my dog, so that was what I ordered.Well, it should have been two times as large as it is to fit my dog.I would estimate the real size of this XXL just L, no larger than that.I would recommend this sweater - just remember, you have to get two sizes larger than it shows in the chart for your dog."
2,VERY tight,I have an English Setter and he is very slender and sleek. Purchased an XL based on size chart and couldn't get it to stretch across his chest far enough to get both front legs into the openings. The sizing is very strange. This has to be returned.
2,Sizing is all wrong,"The product itself it great, but the sizing charts are VERY off. Our 40 pound dog needed an extra large, as the large was much too tight. If you want a cute sweater for your dog, this is a good one, but beware of sizing."
5,Very useful,"Let's face it. Spelling, while a necessary skill, is often a boring activity to practice. How many students do you know that enjoy writing down the same old words 10 times in a row? This book is a little dated, but the great part about it is that it has activities that fit within any spelling unit. The activities require very little prep work, but they are also engaging and enjoyable for students. Activities include students creating and sharing their own word search puzzles, creating spelling word ""sailboats"" and ""smiley faces,"" cutting out old magazine and newspaper letters to spell words, and more. Each activity can be used with your own spelling lists. I used this book regularly when I was student teaching in a first grade class, and I'm sure I'll be using it a lot more in the future!"
5,good resource,I am a collector of ideas for spelling activities. This book is a wonderful resource with a large variety of ways to help the children interact with their spelling words. The activiities vary from week to week so they don't get stale. I like that the ideas can be used with any spelling list.
3,Fat Clown,"Hey! This guy looks exactly like the clown... he's by far the most accurate looking clown for any spawn comics. Another one, the movie clown, is also quite good because it looks exactly like the movie spawn clown. He's fat , ugly and funny,,, he's not very articulated, but it's ok because he don't seem to be flexible anyway after high calories consumption of pizza and cola. This fellar is quite thick skin... he's quite durable because i remember placing him on the highest section of my rack and it fell all the way down and made an incredible sound but it's still in one piece,,, just make sure u don't lose the small cigar and rat that is quite small indeed!"
1,A toy enthusiast,"This toy is HORRIBLE! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! IT IS BORING, STUPID, AND BARELY STAYS TOGETHER! COLLECTORS GET TRASH, AND PEOPLE WHO PLAY WITH THEIR TOYS WONT BE ABLE TO KEEP THIS THING TOGETHER! HORRID! [bad deal]!"
5,Poet/Classicist,"A charming selection of warm, evocative portrayals in verse that evokes and honors its two good friends and fellow saints. With only a few slightly prosaic exceptions, this generous little anthology will repay the reader on many a visit. Its physical production does a particularly good job of delivering a durable, pocketable companion for an all but negligible outlay. I'm pleased to recommend this delightful compendium with enthusiasm. Its subjects live on its pages to embrace the reader."
4,Classical Music Nursery Rhymes,"I bought this CD for my 5th child, who has special needs when he was 5yrs old. I had struggled with 5yrs of disturbed nights; frequently up for 2hr stretches. I would play it in the sitting room whilst cuddling/rocking my son. I would concentrate my mind on the music, rocking patting, walking in time with the beat, until he slept. Because my son frequently needs attention during the night he sleeps in our room, and for the last year or so whenever he wakes at night I play this music softly, it does not disturb my husband and it gives me a focus on which to concentrate instead of mulling over the day ahead or worrying about matters. It has been our nightly friend and companion. Please send us your comments about Majors for Minors."
4,A Much-Needed Return to Form.,"Following the disappointing volumes 2 and 3, Ultra Records gets its groove back on ""Ultra Trance 4,"" a surprisingly consistent collection of 2 discs featuring the latest trance anthems. The more mainstream first disc has readily familiar names and titles, ranging from Paul Van Dyk's ""Connected,"" Jordan James souped up cover of the Bon Jovi hit ""Livin' on a Prayer,"" Plumment's cover of the Sade tune ""Cherish the Day,"" and 4 Strings' explosive ""Turn it Around."" The mood gets a bit darker on the second disc, where we get more instrumental tracks and fewer vocals. Key selections are the bouncy ""White Room,"" Jas Van Houten's energetic ""Loco Love,"" and ""Age of Love."" Just when I thought it was safe to write off this series, Ultra Records comes back strong with two winning CDs on ""Ultra Trance 4"" that should find a welcome home in most dance collections. It's a safe bet that they'll be getting some rotation in my stereo for a while."
2,the onion,"Second issue had only two new articles, all others repeats. Is this the norm for this publication? Will try one more day and cancel if nothing new."
1,Not useable.,"This title is not available for customers from: Germany.Sorry Amazon, but this is awful. So many titles are not available due to stupid copyright restrictions. This makes no sense at all, since I can browse the site via internet.A disappointed Kindle user."
1,Disgusting,Disgusting. Irreverence is tolerable but when it borders on slander it is abominable. Attempts to cloak anti-Catholicism with a parody on global change is religious baiting at its worst. The onion is infectedx with salmonella
3,Formatted poorly,"I gave this a shot for a few days, but it's just not formatted well. For some reason, their HTML->Kindle conversion leaves out spaces between words on a regular basis. You can kind of get used to it, but it's jarring enough to block the humor.It's a cancel for me, I'm afraid, and I love the Onion."
2,Love the Onion but Kindle edition is intolerably flawed,"Despite what you may feel about The Onion (I love it), there's no question in my mind that the Kindle edition of The Onion is terrible. Poor navigation, horrible formatting, not really readable."
2,Not worth it . . .,"I tried the 2-week trial, and canceled my subscription before that was even over! I love the Onion, but this is terrible. It downloaded a bunch of archived articles the day I first subscribed. The next day, it downloaded a handful of new articles. That was over a week ago. There's been nothing since! Why would I pay $1.99 for something that will get me a few articles a week? I'll stick with the online version - since it's FREE!"
3,great but one big problem,love the onion but it wont let me access archived material. so i can only read todays stuff? i try to save them but i dont always get to it every day. i wish it automatically saved them like readers digest does.
5,love the scent,"have had alot of trouble finding this perfume in our local stores..amazon did great here with price and size..not to sweet, not to bold..just the right amount of fragrance..would recommend for teen thru elderly..i love this.."
2,very overpowering,"it doesn't smell bad, per se... but it is SO overwhelming i can't breathe... and you can't get it off unless you take a shower!my bf said i smelled like a school teacher, lol.. which i don't take as a diss but it's an older style smell and it was just too much.. spray SPARINGLY!!!!"
1,Not for my Advents.,I guess I am not sure what these are for because they did not look anything like the surrounds on my advents?
1,Badness,"Look through the pictures in this book : Life in Ancient Egypt"" by Adolf Erman, He has a picture of Scribes recording thepresence of "" NEGRO"" slaves in the book. This was a copy from one of the temple walls and clearly shows that Egyptians depicted Negroes and their features accurately !. I guess this upsets the Apple cart, but so what ? Negroes at that time were no different than they are now ; same hair, lips,etc...This means that the hieroglyphs would have depicted the priests, scribes and pharos with Nappy hair and other negro features, which they do not.Guess they will have to look for another Group to cook up an identity.Even if you told the negro that he invented everything , it still would not change their own perceptions of themselves because deep down, they know it is just a lie. Why cant the Negro just be who they are ? There is no shame in that is there ?"
3,not original thinking,"a book that is telling something new to the aryan races but not to the african, arab, asian civilisations.bernal's idea is not original at all. people should read the quran and see the references to black / white when prophet moses (peace be upon him) challenged pharaoh ~ 1500 BC.also, heavy duty history books in non-english languages such as urdu detail how the egyptian priesthood from africa ORGANISED and created the ancient persian, greek and roman empires.perhaps it is time for africans (afro-americans) to tie up with arab, asian historians because the latter's (non-european) heavy duty literature / history books CONFIRM what george james and martin bernal have been saying.only third rate scholars / academic / mythorians would like to deny the truth and promote the aryan model. the aryans were organised by more intelligent people such as the egyptian priesthood from africa."
1,It's just plain wrong,It's absolute rubbish. This book claims that Aristotle stole a bunch of books from the library at Alexandria and then retuned to Greece and put his name on them. The library wasn't built until at least 297 BCE. Aristotle died in 323 BCE. He couldn't have done it because the library didn't even exist when he was alive.
1,Typical.,"Mr. Bernal's hefty pseudo-historical tome directs most of its efforts at slandering European civilization than anything else. If there is anything one could take away from this book, it would be: Just because it's written doesn't mean it's true. Or, better yet: If it has to be written, it may very well not be true."
3,Where is the Black Athena?,"As much as I enjoyed learning how the history of Greece has been created as a response to the need of a unified and precise European past, I am at a bit of a loss as to the title. Specifically, the book puts forward a convincing case for Semitic Greek roots, especially in the case of Phoenicia. And it does spend some time dealing with the possibility of Egyptian influence. However, Bernal never establishes any sort Greek racial characteristics; indeed, he is cautious at best in identifying an Egyptian race. I understand that he feels an identification with the fringe Black scholars with whom he identifies at the conclusion, but they appear as an afterthought, and their theories are treated with a pat on the head, at best. So I am forced to ask, having just completed the book, where is this Black Athena?"
1,Lack of real facts is what makes this book dangerous,"It is totally unreasonable to believe the entire legacy of Greek civilization did not contain anything that the Greeks themselves contributed. It is also inaccurate to assume that Egyptians were all black. It is plausible that the Greeks learned from the Egyptians just as it is equally plausible that the Egyptians learned from the Greeks. A good book to read is ""Not Out of Africa: How Afrocentrism Became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History"" by Mary Lefkowitz. Lefkowitz shows that the foundations of Bernal's claims are shaky at best. Lefkowitz says that Bernal's claims need to be put under the same academic scrutiny that other claims would go through. Unfortunately, racism is used as an argument instead of a true debate of the facts"
2,Entertaining,"It is obvious that the thesis in this book is more an attempt to prove a hypothesis rather than to arrive at a conclussion through scientific research.I was particularly disappointed to see that Mr Bental seems to have neglected to take into account facts that contradict his hypothesis while at the same time relying on some inaccurate research to prove it.(e.g. Aristotle died 25 years before the library of Alexandria, from which Mr Bental claims Aristotle borrowed some of his ideas, was put together)The book is unfortunately riddled with historical inaccuracies and although it makes an entertaining read fails to convenience the informed reader.It is sad to see a bright academic deviating from scientific principles in support of cultural and ideological beliefs."
1,I like the militants,"There are those militants who continue to give this ""book"" five stars-Deelen,Hezell- and try to push their propoganda. Why?You see, blacks in this country have a self esteem problem. They need a pick-me-up. What better way than to usurp a trully great civilization's history? Greece is the only country to have a true Golden age. Even if they were influenced in the beginning by surrounding cultures their eventual greatness was of their own making. The same was true of Rome. They copied EVERYTHING from the Greeks. Are the modern Greeks claiming Ancient Rome was in reality Greek? No. They don't need to.End of Story."
4,Spurious first review needs rebuttal,"Black Athena was and is one of the most important challenges to mainstream academia. It is by far the most fascinating ""counter history,"" the best informed ""against-the-grain"" reading of Western History written in this era. The absurd cant that passed the Lefkowitz crowd about how Bernal violated academic norms and so forth should be taken for what it is: a rearguard attempt by establishment types to undermine his credentials. The truth of the matter is probably unattainable by human beings, but the truth of this book is equal to and perhaps more germaine than the ""classical Greece"" myth still taught in high schools all over the world. Germaine especially today, I would say.A Professor of History somewhere. Dig my public name, a Dadaist selection."
1,An accurate review:,"The New York Review of Books{The book} is a whirling confusion of half-digested reading, bold linguistic supposition, and preconceived dogma. . . . Bernal has expended enormous energy on Black Athena, but he is absolutely wrong to say in conclusion, as he does, that he has rewritten the history of the eastern Mediterranean. His blurring of true distinctions, his claims to superior interpretation, his painfully jumbled exposition of ideas, his naive belief that every person inside a defined space belonged to a single race or ethnic group, his endearingly childlike faith in the absolute historical value of Greek myths . . . come as a disappointment from such a quick-minded scholar whose 'evidence' was so eagerly awaited."
1,Shameful,"There is a strange phenomenon in our society to not believe the obvious and to belief the absurd - i.e. we can't explain how Stonhenge was built so therefore it must be built by aliens. Bernal's shoddily researched and poorly reasoned book is just that. There should be a special section created in bookstores for books of this nature, it belongs with ""Rosewell The Day After"", and the host of other pseudo science & history books all too common these days."
1,Utter garbage,"Have we all finally let of this myth? After Bernal and his supporters have been embarassed in multiple arenas, his agenda at promoting himself has fallen by the wayside. Now we all know what the original purpose of this book was. Hmmmm.."
2,Entertaining,"It is obvious that the thesis in this book is more an attempt to prove a hypothesis rather than to arrive at a conclussion through scientific research.I was particularly disappointed to see that Mr Bernal seems to have neglected to take into account facts that contradict his hypothesis while at the same time relying on some inaccurate research to prove it.(e.g. Aristotle died 25 years before the library of Alexandria, from which Mr Bernal claims Aristotle borrowed some of his ideas, was put together)The book is unfortunately riddled with historical inaccuracies and although it makes an entertaining read fails to convenience the informed reader.It is sad to see a bright academic deviating from scientific principles in support of cultural and ideological beliefs."
3,Will Bernal Respond to his Critics?,"Black Athena belongs on the bookshelf of every student interested in the history of racism in European thought. The usefullness and importance of this book, however, is diminished by its misleading title and poor organization.I've recently attempted to re-read, after many years, vol I of Black Athena and have come to the startling conclusion that Bernal's most prominent critics, i.e., Lefkowitz, MacLean-Rogers, Berlinerblau, Snowden, have actually done him an enormous favor by rendering his often incomprehensible prose into something far more accessible. (No doubt many of Bernal's readers have come to Black Athena vols I & II by way of the recent scholarly and popular rebutals to his work.)I look forward to a book-length treatment by Bernal of the important issues raised by his critics. The Black Athena debate is far from over and deserves our (and his) careful consideration."
1,What a farce,"What struck me most about Black Athena is the lack of archaeological evidence. Almost all of the evidence Mr Bernal adduces in support of his thesis is linguistic. He cites very little physical (archaeological) evidence, and attempts to deny the need for such evidence by referring dismissively to ""the argument from silence""---what we can find no trace of today cannot have existed in significant quantities then. The title also seems to be a misnomer, since the ancient Egyptians were not black, and his argument is the influence of Egypt, not the influence of sub-saharan Africa. Note: even the name of the continent--Africa--has a non-black etymology: the Roman Scipio Africanus!"
1,Bogus scholarship,"Even afrocentrists are back-pedalling on this atrocity of fake scholarship-see Eerl Hezell. While laughable, it represents how people can use false info to promote their agenda-see Adolf Hitler!!"
1,A Fabrication of Bernal,"His ""theories"" ripped to shreds in academe, Bernal's laughable and embarrassing premise of the roots of Hellenic Culture has already been dumped on the slagheap of malignant, misguided history. Those who are confused enough to adhere to this nonsense are the same unlearned individuals who never possessed the capacity to understand the fountainhead of Western Civilization. You could lead them by the nose to any other fanciful and ridiculous origin of Hellenism and they would just as greedily lap it up in their erroneous scramble to rewrite and ""correct"" history. It is important to remember that for over 2,500 years Hellenism has remained incredibly resilient and has weathered much more severe events than Bernal. It will continue to do so because it is the natural conduit for humans who wish to live their lives in freedom & dignity. By the way, I would have given this book a negative star rating, but Amazon doesn't go that low. Avoid this book and theory like the plague."
2,An intellectual history of modern historical abberation,"This book and the major part of the reactions to it are an insightful source into the regrettable current going on in modern U.S. history-writing to bend all historical discussions to fit modern political debate. However, they offer little more than that; on the contrary, Bernal as well as Lefkowitz et al. seem blind to facts or trains of thought that are contrary to their own preferred insights. This is a *very* dubious way of conducing historical research and the whole debate is eventually thoroughly meaningless. One for the scrapheap of history."
2,Archaeology? What archaeology?,"What struck me most about Black Athena is the lack of archaeological evidence. Almost all of the evidence Mr Bernal adduces in support of his thesis is linguistic. He cites very little physical (archaeological) evidence, and attempts to deny the need for such evidence by referring dismissively to ""the argument from silence""---what we can find no trace of today cannot have existed in significant quantities then. The title also seems to be a misnomer, since the ancient Egyptians were not black, and his argument is the influence of Egypt, not the influence of sub-saharan Africa. Note: even the name of the continent--Africa--has a non-black etymology: the Roman Scipio Africanus!"
1,Strategies of Appropriation or the Culprits Change Face,"The subject of this book is not the discussion of the Greek civilization but the appropriation of Greek culture for the ideologically motivated construction of African (see African American) culture. Bernal replaces the 19th c. Aryan racist appropriation of the Greek phenomenon, with an African American appropriation of the 20th c. for the sake of political correctness (Bernal is not black, and this is not to be missed, dear African American friends). Greek culture and language still exist -- and have survived for more than three millenia despite historiographical fraud -- and for those who have not noticed are neither Aryan nor African. Check out idiois omasi, that is if you are not blinded by your short-lived political and ideological agendas."
5,missing rob from holly faith....old school friend,"well, i got this album in it's 6-song ep form originally released in ATL., i used to go to rob's shows as a slightly younger fan.....hahahaha...it has truely weathered my stint away from atlanta....thanx guys... really appreciate your contribution, and rob, you still owe me a drink at the highlander.....lol"
2,Disappointed - not as pictured,"The bench is not as pictured. First, the color is not the oak-teak tone as pictured - much darker rust/brown in color. This we can live with. However,the problem is that the wooden slats are much narrower than pictured. We have an old one that looks exactly like the picture, and were hoping to get exact replacements... not what we received. The result is this bench is far less cmfortable because we can feel the gaps between the wooden slats when seated (the slats are just slightly wider than the gaps). Thus far we have not been able to find any cushions that would fit this bench."
2,Cheaply made,"I purchased 3 fire pit/garden benches. When they arrived they were not as expected. They were made of an inexpensive Chinese fir and seemed like they would not last in my outdoor, uncovered area. The color of the wood was darker than the picture.CobraCo WBN500 Fire Pit or Garden BenchI was disappointed and sent them back after opening only one of them."
3,IKEA quality,"The item has the quality of IKEA products, but just twice as expensive. Overall it's okay. After we placed our order, we were being told it's on back order and we should place a new order later. When we did that, the price was already higher by $20.-! Not justified in my opinion."
5,Mother of prevention #4,This book was different than any of hers that I have read cried thru the whole first chapter the book was greatlike all of Lori Copland books are. have read many of them.ThanksDAC
4,Secret to getting your boys to read,"This book is so great. I have issues having my boys read, but with this book it made them want to read,"
3,Peter's Adventure,"This book is about an orphan named Peter. Peter loves motos, (dirt bikes). Along the way Peter meets a rich boy named Giff. Giff helps Peter in races and lets Peter stay at his house for a week. Peter fixes Giff's motobike and Peter races it at one of the races. This book would be good if you liked dirt bikes and racing."
2,The Dirtbike Reveiw,This book is about a boy named Peter who gets into a fight with a kid named Dexter Pasini for thinking Peter was trying to steal his dirtbike.Later on he forgives him for what he has done and lets him borrow a spare bike to race.After the race Dex asked Peter to help him steal some bike parts and sell them.He doesn't agree with him so Dex beat him up and rode away.A kid named Griff Macenzi [from the race]helped him up and Peter told him he was homeless.So Griff offerd him a home. This book is not recomended because it was boring

1,Do not waste your money,I would have to say this has been a disappointment. Not only did we have to wait from December until April for these to be available again Fisher Price has eliminated the mazes which is what my 6 year old loves to do. Bottom line: Product is not worth the wait or the money.
5,the book that highlight what physical findings can provide,"this book is combination of ancient artistic physical signs with recently popular scientific evidence based medicine , great work that writer provide detail and clear evidence , all physicians must review their bed side skills with the evidnce ,their trend should be taught in every medical school .5 stars ."
4,Stories of playing experiences and court battles,"Ken Uston once again demonstrates why he was the world's foremost authority on the game of blackjack. His playing experiences were both varied and extreme. In this book, he tells stories (some told before) of his playing experiences, and details his ultimately fruitless attempts to get the Nevada Gaming Commission to stop the casino practice of barring card counters. Of note: in this book he disavows his previously touted Uston APC count, stating that it's just too difficult to use effectively, and that simpler systems are probably more effective in the long run. That piece of information alone makes the book worth having, and in this book he suggests which other systems should be used instead."
5,An extraordinary book,"And it is quite simpy that: extraordinary. A rare combination of a TRUE spiritual search for truth and the tenacious will to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles by rigorous self analysis and by learning to perceive how reality REALLY functions. In doing so Mrs. Knight-Jadczyk provides us with real wisdom and insight as to how to to cope with the realities of modern life and the major issues of our time.At times, painful and harrowing but also humourous and inspiring. Perhaps most importantly, if we search within ourselves we will find that this book opens new doorways to the human condition like no other. I urge all those those who are searching for sound reasoning, objectivity and a truly balanced approach to some of the fundamental questions of our time to purchase this book. There are REAL answers to be found here. A wonderful literary companion to have for those on a genuine, no-nonsense quest for truth.Expect the real McCoy."
4,Unusual Story,"Don't buy this book if you are not interested in questioning the beliefs you hold dear. I found the story of Laura's life to be one ordeal after another, and yet she somehow survived it all. She held the standard beliefs that we are all taught, but through a series of events and revelations, she came to see the foundation of sand that they were built on.This book takes you on a journey that will make you question your own beliefs. Not something for the faint of heart. It will challenge everything you think you know. If you are able to see past human frailties and if you have an open mind, it will make you think in a new way. If you can't, it will probably come across as trailer park mysticism. If that's your mindset, then it's not worth the read."
2,Hopefully a bad translation,"Well, I had high hopes for this. The summary on the back sounded very interesting, but it ended up being rather boring. It seemed like the author was trying to write poetry in prose form. The idea was kind of cool, but it really lacked something. Parts of the different descriptions were intriguing, but in the end it left you wondering exactly what happened. I know it was about ""True"" life in Guatemala, but that's it. Some ideas were worth pondering and I recommend this for a suicidal college poet, but not anyone else."
5,Inspired,"This book is so full of ideas and suggestions, and it's fun to read. I feel I can adapt some of the gift jar ideas for other holiday giving as well. It's a great book."
1,Poor quality recording,"This music was recommended in the book, ""Born To Run."" So I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the recording quality of this CD is poor. It is painful to listen to the music. Avoid it."
5,Great learning tool!,I have tried different books on Egyptian colloquial Arabic and found this one the most useful. I went through the entire book before taking an Egyptian colloquial language class in Cairo and it helped me a lot. It uses basic and everyday words and phrases found in the Egyptian colloquial language. It is a great learning tool for beginners and I hope they make a more advanced book. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the basics of Egyptian colloquial language.
4,One of the best choices,"Learning Arabic is difficult in Europe when you are not having it as a subject in College. Being a self-learning student makes it very difficult. There is not one book available in Czech so I had to go for some in English. I needed something with grammar, colloquial, with audio and the ability to let me learn at least basics of such complex and difficult language. I was not absolutely satisfied with the book - some things were explained poorly and sometimes I needed help of my Egyptian friend to understand the basic grammar but overall it's a good book if you want to get to know the language a bit and when you don't need the official Arabic but the colloquial that allows you to communicate in Egypt."
5,Excellent view of a Socialism as seen thorough human eye,I couldn;t stop reading it until I was finished. Excellent. The author describes Cuba as he sees it and as he sees it through the eyes of a Cuban. This book basically shows a day to day reality of a socialistic and centrist government and what it has done to its people. I only wish other centrist leaders take notice of it.
5,a great relalxing mystery,"If you are looking for a low=keyed, yet entertaining mystery, this is it! The characters are great, just enough interesting ones to keep your interest. The mysteries are light, yet complex enough to hold the viewer's interest.Because of the time era, the introduction of famous people as they are briefly part of the story line, adds a dimension that other settings couldn't incorporate. I love it!this has become one of my favorites!"
2,Worst of the best,I have thoroughly enjoyed the Murdoch Mysteries but was disappointed in the Third season. The stories were much more forced and seemed to have an adjenda. Doctor Ogden is an amazing character but I was glad to see her go. The mysteries and the science was lost and not much was given to replace it. I currently have the first two seasons and will get the Fourth season which is back up to par. Hopefully Third season is just an aberration.
5,See this as soon as you can!,"I'd recommend this to anyone! Fascinating and very well produced, directed and acted. The multiple plot threads are easy to follow, are some flashes of humor, and the resolutions are always satisfactory. Great!!!!!"
4,The general idea.,"Gives you a general idea of whats envolved in repairs, specifications, technical info, definetly beats the bmw's owners manual, etc."
2,Not sturdy at all,"After using it on the train every day to and from work, for a couple of weeks, it is suddenly very delicate. Just brushing with my hand makes it stop playing music. And sometimes when it stops, the buttons don't work, and I have to remove and replace the batteries. And sometimes when it stops, it says that there are 0 MP3's on it; the only resolution I've found to this is to leave the batteries out of it overnight.I initially loved the device, but now I am greatly disappointed.PS - The software is not very well-designed either. It is teeny tiny on my 1600x1200 display, and I can barely see the names of my MP3's with the software."
3,Not quite ready yet,"Two problems: First of all, there is no driver available for Windows 2000, and I sent their tech support e-mail to find out if one would be available soon and never got an answer back, nor does their Web site contain that information.Second, I sometimes can't fill the last 10 MB of the 64 MB. The PC loses connection with the Yepp player and I have to disconnect and reconnect it several times to get the connection running again and even then, it usually continues to fail when I try to add the last couple of songs.Other than that, this is my first MP3 player and I'm not too disappointed with it. It's really light, it's easy to use, the software is easy to use, it's attractive, and you can lock it so the buttons don't get pressed accidentally. The headphones aren't great, but are fine for an hour of exercise.I recommend looking around more before picking this MP3 player."
1,IMUS IN THE MORNING SEZ:,"""This is the most very best piece a music EVER recorded anywhere,anytime in history."" How about that,ey?Terry is SOOOOO FRIED!!! We all know he's been diddling Jillien'Whatta rack' Barberie but most don't realize Terry also goes over to Uncle Don's house and they both play in ballet tights,cup buldges and all.Imus wears the wig and lipstick!!Aw geeezze-is all hell gonna break loose when the other shoe drops on this dudes face!OH MY...when the whip comes down! Merry Christmas Terry....you throw a f-ball pretty good for an old fart! Sonny Jergenson has bigger hands and can still throw a 50 yard spiral from BEHIND his back!"
2,"ok, but not long lasting and doesn't have the shine of fleetwax",this is to review it for gelcoat on a newer boat. I tried it and I've given it to several very picky friends. Our verdict? Not anyware the shine of fleetwax and certainly not the longevity.
4,Great for relaxation,"This CD is excellent for relaxation. I use it with patients when performing craniosacral therapy. There are 12 songs, 11 which are excellent. My only complaint is that song 2 is a little odd, but it's easy to skip and otherwise this CD is a great buy."
1,song 2 ruined my massage!,"What a bummer. i brought this CD to my massage last week. Demanded it be played after hearing so much about the tranquility CD by Real Music. Song 1 starts....i shut my eyes...fall into deep relaxation...then song 2...mmm, so relax-ERRRR-STOP-BANG-BONG. The tempo picks up and it gets extremely loud, out of sync with the other tracks. By the time track 4 hit, Even the therapist was distracted and asked me if I wanted to keep listening to it. I willingly asked her to go ahead and switch. She threw on an album by a group called 2002 (no not the year) called Deep Still Blue. Fabulous!....my dreams came back to the light.I would avoid the Infinity CD for spa treatments...doesnt really work right."
2,It broke quite soon,"I'm still using it as a car charger, but the AC plug broke. The body is made of some buttery plastic.The first time you encounter an AC outlet that demands a little pressure to insert a plug, be prepared to see the metal prongs retract and disappear inside the plastic body.It's cheap though, so I'm not too disappointed."
1,bad writing,"The synopsis looked great, but I couldn't make it through Chapter 2 because the writing is just so amazingly bad! Who edited this book?"
5,These books are gorgeous and sweet,"I love these books. I bought the whole series to give away to all the kiddies in my life. The illustrations are beautiful and the stories are timeless, sweet, thoughtful and cleverly humorous. Wish I could write/illustrate books as beautiful as these."
1,Don't buy this!!!!,"When I first got myself a PS2 about 2 years ago I made the mistake of not getting a memory card. So I ran back into the store and grabbed the first one I saw. Unfortunately it was this piece of junk. By the time I realized I had to load the software every time I played a game it was too late to take it back to the store. So I just dealt with it until just recently when I bought myself a real PS2 memory card. I also have a pretty good idea that this card and the software caused Jak II to have some glitches including a lockup and a cutscene not playing. So whatever you do don't buy this, just spend the couple extra bucks and buy a regular memory card."
1,Not what the pic shows!,"This is not at all what is in the picture. I first tried buying the 16 meg set advertised without the picture but there is no action replay. So I tried again with this set and again, No action replay. All it is, Is an 8 meg card. So unless all you want is a plain mem card, STEER CLEAR."
3,Caution,The picture and header are not correct. The part number is actually a heavy duty iron rod with an eye in the metal and is threaded on the ends.
2,In the words of The Ramones: It don't come close,"I have to disagree with the reviewer from Houston. V2 isn't a patch on Pure Mania. ""Nazi Baby"", ""Destroy"", etc - it was fun on the first album but it comes off as ""trying to hard to shock"" on the second. There's a reason it was never released in the US in 1978 and is still an import on CD. You're better off with a best of that includes non-LP singles and better songs from V2 (and of course, Pure Mania)."
4,Very Validating,The book thus far has been very validating. As I read each chapter I find myself thinking yeah my son says that or does that. It really helps put things in perspective. The tips to improve the relationships between parent and child are very logical and easy to apply.
4,Advice that made you feel that you are not alone,"While reading this book, I felt that the real stories the author shared helped me in realizing I'm not alone and that so many other parents were dealing with the same thing. This book helped me in approaching problems with my daughter in a different way."
3,satisfied,"I am satisfied with the seller, the book came in reasonable condition and time; however, the book isn't quite what I expected. It is very general and alot of common sense."
1,New Publisher,This book received a new cover and has been re-published. New ISBN 0-9788465-0-8.Christina BottoAuthor
4,Great Deal,"The drive is a great deal for the price. It works fast,the security features are great,so like me personal files go in the vault and my everyday files be it music or pictures or something go on the unprotected part of the drive and it looks really nice,love the black.Works for me !!!"
1,A Ripoff,"There is nothing private about the drive. There is software loaded on the drive but unless you pay even more money you can not use the ""vault""."
4,Beloved,"This book made me feel like the ""Beloved"", the ""Prodigal Son"". I have never read a book that made me feel so close to the author. This book made me closer to my God."
5,This is a super fun and inexpensive game!,I bought this for my boys for Christmas (ages 11 and 7) and we have played it several times now! It is a really fun and fast-paced game! It is helping my youngest with his math skills!
4,"Fun for Families, or just Adults","I bought this game for an adult Greek-themed party. We had a blast chasing down Zeus! And we also found out how mathematically challenged we are, LOL! The best games are easy to learn, have some simple strategy (or just bluffing) and are lots of fun. This game passes the test! It doesn't have the repeated playability of group games like Guesstures or Catch Phrase, so it gets only 4 stars."
3,Zeus is okay,"We have several Gamewright card games and just adore some of them. But Zeus on the Loose just hasn't been that fun for our family (girls 9 and 6). The balance of luck vs. skill vs. all-out-wanting-to-win just doesn't make it. My daughter is a big Percy Jackson fan, so the Greek Myth angle was huge for her, but not enough for her to choose to play this over other favorites, like Sleeping Queens."
2,Not as much fun as other Gamewright games.,"My kids and I got bored with this game quickly. Yes, it has playing cards with Greek gods like Apollo and Aphrodite and Poseidon on them, and cool illustrations, so you'll hear those sounds coming out of their mouths and they'll learn to pronounce it af-fro-ditey... But that's about it. There are descriptions of who they are and what they do... in the instruction sheet, which will likely be quickly lost or destroyed. And kids don't like to read the instructions, in my experience. It's the only Gamewright game we don't like."
5,Romantic Obsession,"I've read a good deal of Woolrich over the years, especially many of his short stories. Waltz into Darkness is quintessential Woolrich. Woolrich's stories have been a staple for so many film noirs and this novel typifies one of the most familiar noir motifs - how a basically decent man can be destroyed because of his obsession for an amoral woman. Woolrich's personal life sorely lacked any romantic connection and this yearning for that physical and emotional connection is embodied in the character of Louis Durand. Nowhere is all of Woolrich's literature is the romance of loneliness, despair, and fatalism so richly explored than here."
3,disappointed,"While I felt this book was overwritten, I realize this is a generational thing. The writing style is very old-fashioned. It seemed written in the style of Theodore Dreiser, who was about forty years before Woolrich. But for all that, it is an accomplished story. HOWEVER, the ending was just ridiculous. Overly romantic, and entirely unrealistic. Sociopaths don't suddenly grow hearts. Still, fair dues to Woolrich for a compelling read. Maybe his editor made him tag on the absurd ending."
3,WALTZED INTO DARKNESS,"LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AFTER READ THIS BOOK,THE PRINTS ARE RATHER SMALL AND THE BOOK IS HEAVY."
2,Disappointing!,"Potential buyers should be aware that the `Jungle Book' is not a novel but a collection of short stories.These are not in chronological order nor indeed necessarily connected to one another. Some are not even set in the jungle but rather in Alaska or on Baffin Island!The resulting hodgepodge is plainly not very interesting, certainly much less than the many children's books that have been derived from it or than the famous Disney animated movie!"
3,"Good fundamentals, but getting dated.","While well-written for the day, the content is becoming dated. This is most evident with the statistical evidence and case studies provided. The other criticism would be the lack of any substantive information on the violence assessment process itself.Still, a very good introduction into issues surrounding workplace violence. Breverman has much to offer and his pithy and no-nonsense approach does make me want to check out some of his more recently written books."
5,Get beat-down Iowa-style.,"I have to admit, I'm biased. I've known all the guys in the band for over 5 years- so I've always been appreciative of what they've done. Having said that, ITR really captured their sound. If you get a chance, check them out live. These fellas are the real deal."
1,Don't read the reviews...,"I got this book based on its excellent reviews in preparation for a semester in Italy. Usually I choose Lonely Planet or the Rough Guides for travelling, and now I wish I had stuck to those. The book is difficult to read and its attitude makes me angry every time I open it. I feel like it doesn't have very much history or background, and putting prices for every attraction in parenthesis in the text is distracting. Not only that, it doesn't really say anything new -- you are left with information about the boring central tourist attractions, and no way to escape the herds."
2,Can't handle video capture,This card is not suitable if you are looking for a video capture card. When capturing analogue video many frames are dropped and the final result is very low quality and hardly usable. Give this card a miss if you are after a video capture card.
3,Cougar Video Edition - Mission Impossible 3,"Lets make this simple. If your looking fo value for money this is a pretty hot card. Beware though that this is a cut down TNT2 M64 card. Higher res. are a no go area for high spec games. Saying that Quake 3 is a breeze to play and Sega rally 2 works superbly albeit 800X800 mode. Video editing is limited but for simple things like creating decent video emails or for hooking up a camcorder for video conferencing via NETMeeting etc, then this card does more than the job in hand. Buy this card only if you are on a really tight budget. Otherwise there are plenty of cards out there that fair better in all departments. Leave video editing to proper dedicated cards, this one is ok for starters (and thats being nice)."
4,Sylvia Kristel DVD,Not the best of the DVD by Sylvia Kristel but she is still beautiful and have added it to my collections--best DVD where she plays Emanuella
1,OLD FILM LONG BEFORE SYLVIA SHOWED THE WORLD HER FEMININE TALENTS,THIS MOVIE TRADED ON SYLVIA'S LATER SUCESS. THIS IS A GRADE C MOVIE.keep your money and spend it more wisely than I ..
2,Living La Vida Juila,Lots Of Funny Scenes Including a Death scene. But Food Don't Mix With Sex Scenes Unless Your Into That Fetish. Good Quality. Great Sound. Fair Acting. All And All Fair Sleazy Of A Flick.
3,"Ok, but not great","I know others had problems with rust spots - I haven't had ANY issues like that. I think if you hand wash after use you will be fine. They definitely aren't for the dishwasher.My only complaint is that they arrived dull. Yes, there is a sharpener, I received two in fact, but still, having to sharpen all the knives (not the steak ones obviously) took a bit of the newness out of the situation, and made it work.Otherwise, they are great, and after a lot of time spent for the initial sharpen I haven't had a problem. They are nicely balanced, and look very nice on my countertop."
1,Rusting!,"I bought this set from Bed Bath and Beyond. We used several knives, hand washed them and let them dry overnight on a rack in the sink. One knife had a large rusty stain on it in the next morning! My wife and I could not believe it. It would not happen even to one of our dollar store knives! So much for the steel made in China! We were able to return the set and bought Henckels from Amazon and have been satisfied with them. I made sure, the set is made of German steel in Germany."
1,Rusting !,"This was my first set of ""nice"" knives. I am SO disappointed ! Right away they began to rust and are continuing to do so, more and more. Even my cheap knives from Target don't rust. The positive comment I have about them is their sharpness is awesome. I wish I had investigated the quality before I bought these. I just assumed any Chicago Cutlery product would be great since the name is supposed to mean quality. Wish I had saved for something of better quality ...."
2,Think over carefully if you want to wait a long time to get a flawed product,"I ordered this a LONG time ago! Finally, it arrived and I was not pleased to find that this made-in-china piece had two large gaps, on opposing sides of the central tile. The wood surrounding two sides of the tile was crudely cut and unstained.This is the only piece of the Royal Albert Old Country Roses that I am collecting of which I am displeased. I'm not going to go to the trouble of returning it, although it was overpriced, but I may reduce my purchases of the Old Country Roses ceramics.You need to read carefully on these pieces what others have found about the individual quality of the pieces. They vary. Be careful."
2,Old School Juvenille Metal,"This band was popular in the upstate New York area in the 80's. They were great to watch live, but this cd has lousy production which doesn't represent how good these guys were live. Also, this music hasn't withstood the test of time. Listening to this 20 years later, it sounds dated and corny, like a group of 13 year olds would write. Very basic riffs and lyrics."
3,content okay but very very very tiny print,I guess the content of this book will add to my study I'm doing of the 12 apostles but the print is ridiculously small! There's this huge book (8-1/2 x 11) in size and it just has a bunch of photocopied pages inside that are about 1/9 size of the full sheet. Why not enlarge the print?
5,Highly recommended,"As a linguist I would recommend this book to anybody who is seriously interested in studying Egyptian Arabic. The book has an excellent structure to make it as easy as possible to understand and learn Arabic. It is a perfect introduction to the language and culture, enabling the student to actually communicate and write in the language.Agueda Morsy"
5,its gonna be a fine night tonight *singing*,ohhh this is such a good song... i wish i had known that you could get it at Amazon though b/c one of my friends just ordered it for his girlfriend and had to import it from DENMARK! anywayz.. this is one of the prettiest songs *its one of my favorites :)) * and its definitely worth the money... i promise.. youll never ever ever get sick of it.. its just one of those songs that gives you a feeling that only certain songs can provide...... buy it!
5,The end-all program for laptop DJs,"What could be easier? If you want to make beat-driven music, Acid is the only way to go. Just click and drag. Simplest interface ever, as long as you have loops ready. Sure, you could use all of the royalty free samples they give you, but if you want something really original, you can get a sound recorder, sample MP3 songs on your computer, make those into loops, and viola! Instant muzak! Ever wish you had the talent to be like the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, or any other nameless electronica acts? Well, it turns out, you don't have to know anything at all! Acid allows for endless experimentation. Mix different sounds together, you eventually come up with something good."
5,The Greatest,ACID PRO 3.0 Is the best money can buy. I would recommend anyone going into music to give it a try. I'm sure it will blow you away.
4,great software..,great program..easy to use and with some really good quality samples..i recommend it ^_^
4,Last volume...,"Buy the first, before any comment about how it ends your little bit of curiosity gets squashed."
4,A Sad Yet Inspiring Story,"This is actually a biography of Takashi Nagai, a Christian who worked early in the field of radiology and ironically died of radiation poisoning from the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki. It's worthwhile tracking down not only for its heartbreaking account of the destruction of that city and its citizens, but also for its portrayal of Nagai's intelligent struggle through a number of worldviews before becoming a follower of Christ. Along the way you'll learn about the history of Christianity in Japan. You won't soon forget some of the images in this book."
5,The sound of the recorder is brilliant,I have never heard such a pleasant sound of a recorder; the violin is a typical italian performer. Try it !
4,well-written summary of the struggles of LD,"This is a well-written first person account of the LD experience. The author illustrates for the reader not only the academic difficulties experienced by the individual with LD, but also the effects of learning differently upon self-esteem, familial relationships and social relationships (often the pieces forgotten by us, the professionals). I feel that this book can be valuable for practicioners, parents and individuals with learning disabilities (particularly as they move throughout their lifespans and continuoulsy greet challenges unique to those with LD). Overall, this piece is well-written, difficult to put down and offers valuable insights that can benefit those who are LD and/or work with individuals with LD."
3,A good book for traverlers,"There are some significant factual errors in this book (e.g., Westmoreland was never chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; South Vietnam collapsed because it was attacked by 19 North Vietnamese division equivalents, not because of internal collapse)but it describes in interesting detail what tourists might expect if they follow the author's route."
3,Too many apologies,"Of course, atrocities were committed during the Vietnam War. By both sides. Heinemann tends to forget this fact and ignore the number of US soldiers left with only their heads hanging in a tree. While the Vietnamese didn't threaten our shores, we were the ones who invaded under the misguided policies of a military-industrial complex hungry for a war. Heinemann's trip back ""home"" is more of a travel epic than a memoir of the battles. He does capture the incredible forgiveness of a people who only remember the US incursion as the ""American War,"" since there were a number of wars that followed. While there is much of interest here in terms of the new Vietnam, it is not of the caliber of works by O'Brien and even others by Heinemann himself.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
5,He was a soldier once and young,"This is a wonderful combination of achingly-real men-at-war memoir and modern-day Vietnam travelogue -- written with unforgettable raw intensity. The author was one of three brothers to be drafted into the Vietnam War and is the only survivor, one having committed suicide after his return to the US and the other disappeared and presumed dead. Despite the tragedy of family losses, Heinemann writes clearheadedly about his youthful experience in the steaming jungle and then about his warm meetings with his former enemies while touring the country on multiple trips in more recent times. His distinctive voice made such an impact on me that immediately upon finishing the book, I ordered the audio version and am enjoying reliving the experience of Heineman telling his bittersweet stories. Highly recommended in both book and audio format."
1,I was disappointed.,"Having serve in the same area of 'Nam as the author, I was excited to order the book and read it. It really disappointed me -- I am not a ""gung-ho'"" war vet but I was truly offended by the author's stance of things. I respect his position as a vet but I don't agree. As hard as I tried to finish this book, I wasn't able to. The negative take, the foul-language was too much."
1,Defective manufacturing,"I was unable to view this film because the DVD, once it had run through the previews of coming attractions, would hang when the play option was chosen from the main menu. Thinking I may simply have had a defective disk, I requested a replacement and the same problem presented itself with the replacement disk. I ordered Ang Lee's Lust/Caution at the same time and had no problem viewing that disk. I must surmise that the whole production run of this disk is defective."
3,"""What We Were Meant To Do We Have Done""","The '07 romance `Silk' is one of the most visually stunning films in recent memory which in and of itself is enough reason for one to give this movie a viewing. Unfortunately once you move beyond the lush, sumptuous landscape and the hopelessly romantic soundtrack you come face to face with a slow, plodding storyline that even the most lovelorn amongst us would have trouble staying with.Keira Knightley is the vision of loveliness her audience has come to expect but love interest Michael Pitt is way over his head, failing to display the emotional depth and angst required for this role. With a more established, polished actor in this role who knows, maybe this could've been a love story for the ages?"
5,One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen.,"Silk has been filmed with great care to scenic cinematography and is actually also a very interesting story about the early silk trade and how difficult it was to secure. The actors, the performances, all excellent. If you enjoy beauty in film, see ""Silk"""
1,A truly wretched film,"It is hard to believe a film that employs the acknowledged talents and charms of Ms. Knightly could manage to be as dull, trite and devoid of impetus as this disaster. The plot wanders aimlessly back and forth across the wastes of Siberia, and from one improbable assumption to another...for instance, given France's far flung Empire at the time, with secure maritime routes across the Indian Ocean and Asia right up to Japan's doorstep,why on earth is our hero trudging through Siberian icescapes to get there? I mean, on the way back you could assume I suppose the eggs needed refrigeration, but other than that it's just plain silly.In most cases of pretentious B-movie drivel, the presence of a lovely and talented actress such as Keira Knightly acts as a sort of consolation prize. No such luck: she somnambulates through this train wreck as though she herself finds it hard to accept that she is really a part of the fiasco.I can empathize. I can't believe I bought this DVD!"
1,What's with the accents?,"This movie was just plain awful. I ended up feeling depressed and confused. Depressed because I had just wasted my time watching it, and confused because I had no idea how important plot points happened (eg. Keira Knightley writing the letter - there is no clue that she knows he has been cheating on her).Anyway, something else that got my goat was: WHY ARE THEY SPEAKING WITH US ACCENTS? I didn't understand which country they were supposed to be in!! I honestly thought they were in the USA until he started mumbling about France! Then I though, wtf? They could've at least spoken in English accents if they didn't want to use French ones! OMG this movie was horrible! And the lead characters lips were so revolting to look at. He looks like he's had too much collagen and not enough sleep.UGH, don't even bother!"
1,Horrible movie. Do not watch it.,"I'm not going to go into any details, but I will say that I wish Amazon could refund the time I spent watching this movie. It looked like it would have promise but in the end it was a big dud. Watch it at your own risk!"
2,Visually Magnificent...but Dull Script Detracts From That,"Well, I just finished watching Silk, and all I can think about is the hour and a half of my life I'll never get back...The scenery in this movie is a feast for the eyes, and the only pro as the dull and lifeless script made me fast-forward through most of the movie. I found the characters to be very underdeveloped, as well as the plot; specifically I had issue when Michael Pitt's character Herve develops an fixation with a Japanese concubine, which is a major reason why he makes repeated trips back to Japan (the backbone of the movie), seems very unfounded; the two have very little screen time and no dialogue, yet an ""obsession"" blooms. If you love historical fiction as I do, I recommend something more satisfying... like the English Patient, Zelery, Pride & Prejudice"
3,It's ok,That's about all I can say for it. Nothing to write home about. I love Kiera Knightley! That's why I watched it.
2,Too slow moving to watch for me,"It was beautiful at times, and then it slowed down to a craw. Too, too, slow moving.Beautiful and at times interesting"
2,Boring,"I like the actors in other movies. I believe this movie is one of the most boring I have seen in quite awhile. It took me four days to watch. It just drug on forever. The only reason I kept watching was I hope it would get better, it never did."
2,Not So Good,"BEWARE: SMALL, POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW!i don't know about the book, but the obviously intended drama doesn't materialize in this film. there's so much in a good novel that doesn't translate to the screen. i think maybe the film was miscast. i picture Colin Farrell in the lead role. as it is, Keira should have given this one a pass, but it must have seemed to have potential on paper.it occurs to me that nothing ever happens between the two potential lovers. so the story is reduced to a couple of hours of longing and remembered longing.great cinematography, though i don't think all of it was real. good music, too.re another review: what does it mean to say a film is a ""tone poem""? it's not enough for a film to create a mood with images and music."
1,lifeless,"First, I have to say how wonderful the book is. As with most cinematographic adaptations, this one fails to bring the story to life on screen.The actor's performance, and by that I mean Pitt's, is terrible. When you read the book, he certainly does not come to mind. His voice is not appropriate, nor is his age, for the role presented in the book.That said, I realize that not everyone envisions books the same way, and that is a good thing (most of the time). However, in my eyes, the movie does not do justice to the writing style of Alessandro Baricco, author of the book ""Silk"".The cinematography of the movie is beautiful, although at times one has to wonder why there is so much light in the Japanese houses. That seems overdone.I found the movie much too slow, pointless and ... lifeless.I had much higher expectations for it.A disappointment."
5,"Right Item, Right Price",The exact connector to power my Garmin GPS 12 using vehicle 12 Volt supply. Just plug into an Aux supply receptacle or cigarette lighter receptacle.
2,design was good,I was happy with the design but both seat covers ripped after a very short time. A waste of money
5,Best Work Yet!! A True Star,"This CD is unquestionably Ty's best work yet.Someday Soon, and Right About Now are amazing."
5,Right About Now is Right On,Ty Herndon is one of country music's most talented artists and that talent is evident on Right About Now. This eagerly anticipated album will not disappoint fans who have become accustomed to Ty's remarkable vocal abilities and songs sung from the heart. Right About Now is right on!
1,Out of date - wait for the next edition coming soon,"I'm a french native, and I have been living in Brazil for more than 2 years. With an extensive travel experience, I turned to the Lonely Planet guide to discover the country. But Brazil is huge and evolving at a quick pace. That makes the guide outdated. Moreover as it is the first edition, the guide missed a lot of wonderful places and still lacks basic information. You should be aware that Brazil is a difficult country to travel if you don't speak portuguese."
2,Disappointed,"Cheap fabric, snags on everything and rips like dry rot. Picture is nice but don't judge by that. No way to justify the price."
5,Best MP3 Player for your Money!,"Overall, this player packs more punch than all the others. No other player can compete in storage capacity (you can buy additional storage to the 32MB included here), and the eGo has more innovative features, such as MP3Mail and Interactivity. Using the i2Go website, you can customize your own news, sports, and weather content for downloading to your eGo. The eGo can also load an IBM microdrive for a whopping 340mb of storage space, or 680mb if you buy two microdrives and the optional Compact Flash Expansion Slot! Also, it's not locked into a certain amount of memory, you can add more as the flash card technology improves. It's also slick-looking and perfect for the car. The eGo is a great product and well worth the money."
4,Very useful for cleaning you your writing.,This is a useful book because it covers many types of writing problems. I have read it cover-to-cover and I use it myself. I have found it helpful to people where English is their second language.
2,Has Not Worked,"Had such hope and waited so long for it to arrive, but have had no relief of my symptoms. Very Disappointed."
1,Of strictly historical interest,"This book is useful for those studying the history of child psychology and autism, since Bettelheim's theory that parents caused autism was so influential for so long, but anyone reading the book should be aware that his theory has been discredited. Books like I Want To Hear Your Voice, by Catherine Maurice, and The Siege, by Clara Claiborne Park, are far more likely to be useful for those who have an autistic family member (both books are by mothers of autistic children)."
1,Disgraceful Parent Bashing,This is shocking example of pseudo-science and blaming parents for everything. The man was a charlatan!
5,Lesson on hard work,"I purchased the book for my two daughters who play soccer. I was very pleased that the book discussed many aspects of life, not just issues on the soccer field (just like the book cover promised). It was especially interesting to see Mia Hamm's handwritten practice notes - it demonstrated that Mia's success didn't come with talent only, but with much discipline and hard work. I would recommend this book to anyone with teen daughters, whether they play soccer or not."
5,Mia Hamm,This was a very good book on the life of Mia Hamm and the bsics of soccer. I would recommend this book to anyone just because it was written by one of the stars. It was an awesome book.
3,The title is misleading - not as good as I had expected,"As a soccer coach of girls/young women, and a State referee I was disappointed in this book. I have followed women's soccer for some time now, and it goes without question that Mia Hamm is one of the worlds top players. However, if you are looking for an autobiography of Mia, this is not the book. Further, the techniques mentioned are good, but most of them are for beginning players. I, personally, did not find this book to be "" a champion's guide to winning in soccer and life."" I enjoyed the book, but I guess that I was expecting more, or something different. The book has more "" ups "" than "" downs "" but overall I was disappointed. Mia tends to be a private person, which is understandable. I'd like her to write a more personal autobiography someday because I believe that she has a story to tell, which would be more engaging than this book."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I was a little disappointed to learn, after starting the book, that it is really geared for kids/teens. (It makes reference to ""your parents"" letting you watch soccer on TV.) I would have liked to know that before I bought it. Also, she really seems to stress the importance of mastering specific skills and doing repetitious drills at a very young age. As the coach of a 9-year-old girls team, I really believe that stressing drills, albeit to develop important skills, at this point in their development would bore them and potentially drive their interests elsewhere. For nine year olds, the most important thing is to keep it fun, so they keep coming back. After reading all the other glowing reviews, I guess I expected a little more."
5,I am buying this book for my entire U-12 girls soccer team.!,"Girls don't have the role-models that boys do. As a U-11 girls coach I asked the girls to tell me about their sports heros (soccer or otherwise). Most had none. Pose the same question to eleven-year-old boys, and hear a VERY different answer. This fall we are using it as our team bible. This kind of reading could motivate a young girl for life. It teaches to strive for greatness in all that you do, and all in the conext of a young girl who grows to be a fierce competitor and wonderful person."
3,good kid book,Written for a young audience I'd say. Good but very simple. My 12 year old is reading it but she lost interest half-way through.
2,Not that good,"Personally, I found this really boring. I'm not really sure what I just read. I was kind of hoping that there'd be some personal insight because Mia Hamm is a facsinating person. When I finished I really wasn't inspired, or informed, or anything. I was just bored. There are better books out there, this one isn't really worth your time."
2,Go For the Gloat,"This book was very disappointing. It is defintely not any type of guide for winning in soccer or life. I really felt this was really more about Mia gloating about how good she is rather than how she got there or sharing any insight into what it takes to win. It is not hard to win in soccer if you are surrounded by all those good players and she didnt really share any personal insight other than she was a military brat.I cant say I would be inspired by this book either... this is not an autobiography, its not a guide to how to play good soccer, its more about how many times she can take credit for a goal or assist...."
4,"VERY inspirational, Mia Hamm is an awesome role model.","This book was VERY inspirational and teaches you everything you need to know about soccer. Mia Hamm is my role model and I look up to her. She wrote a very good book, and I think every soccer player should read it."
5,Wax is for the Flintstones,"Ever since I could drive I have been religious about maintaining the appearance of my cars, washing and waxing constantly (because wax only last about 6 weeks). Last year the thought came into my mind that there had to be something better than wax for protecting my car, something that would require the same or less work, would last much longer and wouldn't cost much more. I mean, come on, its 2009! Well, I was right, I found Klasse, their Sealant and the All-in-one are the future. I've had it on my cars for one year now, and it is true, it last way, way longer than traditional wax based products. Its the Jetsons verse the Flintstones and no one in their right mind would disagree once they give it a try."
