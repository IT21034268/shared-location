1,Watch out,"So I ordered this DVD specifically for one of the movies in the description, and it turns out the movie is not even on the set!"
3,Time lines seem a little off from other Wesley books.,"Intresting and to the point. Some of the dates do not conincide with other historical accounts of Wesley that I have read, but all in all a good basic reading on Wesley."
4,"Acoustic versions - kind of a period piece now, innit?","I like this album, but then again, I like this sort of thing. The top keeper on this disc is the Black Crowes' track... the dominant acoustic accompaniment is a PIANO, not an acoustic guitar (though the guitar is in there). Nice to hear it this way, and I love the studio version.Queen's tune is also good, as is Greg Lake's and Eddie Money's."
4,huge help,"I thought this book was really great, easy to follow and I loved that in different sections they would actually outline treatments recommended by various hair specialists around the country. The only drawback is that the book is now 6 years old and should probably be updated. We're ready for a second edition!"
3,beginners only!!,"This book is strictly for the beginner domestic investigator. If you have a collection of these books, or if you are an investigator and just looking for fresh ideas then this one is really not worth it."
3,Deceivingly oversized,"From the picture it looked great! Small and simple. However, it is deceiving because the wrist band is almost double the width of a standard resin watch band... then the size of the watch becomes much bigger!! and also it is much thicker than what you would guess. I got it and tried it on my wrist... it looked huge! Though the design is nice, and the balckout option appealing, I returned it... also because this particular unit had some strange stains inside the glass, like if it had condensation that later dried up."
5,dwaves dvd,great dvd for people who like good punk music and not the corporate crap that becomes popular. Will watch over and over
4,Great Tool,This is a great blueprint. I would recommend it to anyone needing to assess their current Help Desk structure.
2,Disappointed Thompson Fan,"I absolutely love Carlene Thompson's books, but I just could not get into this one. I read to page 100 and just couldn't read anymore. I am usually enthralled by her books, but his one did not have me wanting more."
2,Ok~ Not one of the best I have read,"I am a true fan of psycholgical suspense and horror books, this one was just ok.... There wasn't anything in particular that made it just ok~ I don't know It didn't grab me like other novels have.. my 2 cents"
5,KEEPS YOU GUESSING UNTIL THE END,Carlene has done it again-- stumped the reader right up to the end! I suspected at least half a dozen characters of murder before the real murderer was revealed. Anxiously awaiting her next book. Keep up the good work Carlene! Your dad would be so proud!
4,Not my favorite but still a great story,Charlene Thompson is such an amazing author. Typically I can't put her books down. This one took me a little longer to get through. The last half of the book is where it picks up. Not my favorite but still a great story that gave me goosebumps. And the ending genuinely surprised me the last ten chapters had me suspicious of so many characters and I didn't suspect the real killer for a moment.
2,there has got to be more on the market,"This thing is pretty good,although the wooden 'feet' on it are chewed pretty fast. (the shipping from my seller was outrageous. it came bent since it was stuffed in an envelope and subjected to the post office.)The hamsters would climb on it sometimes, but it is only about 3-4 inches tall so I guess it wasn't as fun? I think it would be better for small robo/chinese/dwarf hamsters since it is so small. I wish there was more available for climbing on the market, this is all I could find and I could take it or leave it."
4,Ishavasya Upanishad - Osho's discourse on inner liberation,"Osho, the controversial guru of the 80ies, provides an insightful and practical perspective on the liberation of the mind by using this ancient Hindu Upanishad. Along with his ""Tantra, the Supreme Understanding"" this work is a valuable introduction into eastern thinking without getting hung up on technical history or religious details. Above all, the book is practical and devotional in nature. Recommended to all who are tired of and burned out with traditional western religious systems. Osho is like a breath of fresh air."
5,B.A.,"This was a very fun model kit to build. Nice and simple, didn't take a lot of thought to put it together. Easy enough to paint, only thing was I didn't know what colour of paint to use because the instructions are in japanese. I don't know how durable this model is, I assume its good, but it just kinda sits on display in my room. I really like Trowa from Gundam Wing, so I started collecting mobile suits he piloted."
5,"Wonderful, Wise and very helpful","""Wonderful, wise words. It provides insight into the human side of serious illness and offers patients and families the hope and strength they need."" Jimmie Holland, chairman Psychiatry, Memroial SLoan Kettering""Filled with practical information for freinds and family, it should prove to be a great comfort..."" Andrew von Eschenbach, director, the FDA""...Provides hope and teaches us how to show compassion when it means the most."" Steven Rosen, MD, director of the Lurie Cancer Center"
3,Not for my situation,"This book had lots of advice on how to support ""loved ones"" with cancer. While I'm sure lots of this advice will help others, it had little which applied to my family's situation. Most of the advice was geared towards either 1) the spouse of the cancer patient, or 2) a friend of the cancer patient. If you are in one of these 2 categories this book will be helpful. However, as an adult whose widowed, cancer-diagnosed mother lives in another state, I found exactly one sentence in the book which addressed my situation. After reading it I am still lost and unsure of what to say and do for my mother."
5,mickey car mat,"very nice product good quality, a must have for any disney fan!!!!!!!made out of quality material should last a very long time!!!!!!!!!"
2,thump thump thump thump,"all of the songs sound the same, and this sound isn't even pleasant, innovative, or original.thump thump thump thump ""driving song!"" thump thump thump thump ""driving song!"".that about sums up the whole album. even after seeing them live, i'm not impressed."
5,A treasure,"In American Nightingale, Bob Welch demonstrates a capacity rare inwriters: a perceptive talent who respects history as he chronicles thequietly profound legacy of one heroic individual who made a difference -Frances Slanger, Army nurse. The book is a treasure because of the writer'spersistent research, his weaving of Slanger's words with his own to tell hercompelling story, and the ultimate truth that he confirms for all of us -that war cannot and will not ever crush the unconquerable human spirit.For me, this is one of those ""Couldn't Put It Down"" reads!"
4,Extensive Research,"I enjoy the author's columns in our local newspaper and so read this book when it came out. I was impressed by all the information he included, making the book a great historic documentary of the times. Personal interviews with still living participants are especially relevant. Frances' personal story flowed through the center, driving the story. It's a compelling narrative of the suffering and sacrifices of soldiers in war time. It also adds to our knowledge of women in WWII."
5,A Genuine Heroine,"Writing by the light of a flashlight one night in a darkened Forty-fifth Field Hospital tent, Frances Slanger, an army nurse during World War II, wrote a letter to ""Stars and Stripes"" about the wounded soldiers she treated, noting that ""the courage and fortitude they have is sometimes awesome to behold."" Although she was not destined to see her letter in print, it was read by thousands of American servicemen, doubtless clipped and saved by many. Now, sixty years later, with the publication of ""American Nightingale"" author Bob Welch has written with warmth and honesty about this remarkable young immigrant woman who surmounted many obstacles to serve her country with wholehearted devotion."
4,Hometown hero,"She has been a hero since I was a child. The book is excellent, American Nightingale should be a must read for all nurses,especially those of us from Boston."
5,Great book!!,Another amazing book about the Nurses in WW2. Very easy reading and I never wanted to put it down. These women were true Angels of Mercy.
1,don't bother,"This was melodramatic, trite, and completely lacked any sort of understanding of real life. As a military nurse and veteran of the current Iraq war, I was apalled by the way the author milked this story for all the melodrama it was worth.That said, Frances Slanger's life and death should be recognized. If you want to read about her, look her up online, or contact the Stars n' Stripes newspaper itself to view the original letter she wrote along with the responses she never got to read."
4,Review of Chesapeake,"very good story, read it 20 years ago and wanted to read it again. anyone interested in early settlement of America and espically the eastern shore of Maryland will like it."
4,A nice read.,The book flows. Is a nice read at bedtime. This is my first Michener novel and won't be the last.
5,This book is excellent! You must read it!,"When I was first given Chesapeake, I thought that it would be boring. Who could cover 400 years of history and not be boring? I was so wrong! I love this book and can not wait to read it again. I became so involved with all of the families, that when someone grew old and died, I mourned their death! This author's insight into people and animals is amazing! I loved the chapter on the geese and how they were outsmarting the Turlocks! My appreciation for history has increased, as well as my vocabulary. Michener describes the scenes in the book so vividly that you feel like you are there. Do not be intimiated by the size of the book, I wish that it was longer. I is wonderful! You will not be disappointed!"
3,"Good, but...","I'd previously read Alaska by Michener and enjoyed in immensely. As a local resident of the Chesapeake Bay, I really enjoyed Michener's unparalleled chronicle of it's history told through such compelling characters. At the risk of sounding offensive to some however, I was surprised at the proportion of the book focused on slavery and Quakerism. Michener does a great job capturing the wrong of slavery, and likewise on aspects of Quakerism, but fully 75 percent or so of the book seems primarily focused on these two subjects. I would have enjoyed a more balanced view of the many other subjects that suffered such as Native American history, two wars with the British, economic development, etc."
4,A Good Michener But Not Great,"Michener is wondrous with adjectives, using them to enhance the image that he describes for us. I enjoyed this book but it was not flawless. Still, it's worth the read."
4,Almost finished the book.,"It's is very lengthy but good. Having traveled to that area several times, I was interested in its history. The complex question of slavery was well documented. I recommend it."
3,"Good story, but long-winded at times","I really enjoyed hearing about all of the history of the Chesapeake and enjoyed many of the storylines from over the centuries. However, the book really drags on in my opinion. The sections from the perspective of the geese seem forced and superfluous. It makes any already slow reading book even longer. Also, by the last few chapters I was done. Just too much about the same families with similar story patterns repeating themselves. Especially the very end of the book with Watergate chapters. It was painful to read."
5,It is good,"I am reading this book for an AP US/VA History class over the summer. I like very much the first 100 pages, it was a page turner. Now that I am near page 300, I am getting kind of bored with the plot. When the new characters who are not as interesting as teh first ones are introduced, things get a little boring. I do think it it a great book, and all interested in history should read it."
5,Chesapeake,"From Pentaquods trek down the river to the funeral of Pusey Paxmore, Chesapeake is a brilliant novel of the chesapeake bay and the families of people who fought to make it great."
4,Another Wonderful Michener Work,"The second novel I have read by Michener, ""Chesapeake"" is wonderfully written, and takes the reader on a journey through time in the Tidewater region of Virginia and Maryland. I found this novel informative and entertaining."
3,Chesapeake is not intended for the average male reader,"Chesapeake, although fairly well structured, is a somewhat monotonous book in that it does not follow a plot line, but rather the events taking place in a location (The Chesapeake Bay area). I chose this book for a book report in a college course I am taking this year, and found it to be consistent with our material, which is a positive thing, however, it is consistent to the point where it is nearly synonamous with reading directly from a history book, with things filled in here and there for coherence. Overall, it was a good book, but not for those who intend to actually want to have a desire to read their book before turning in for the night."
2,Lousy book,This was a lousy book. I didn't like it because it was to realistic and had to many details. I also thought it had to much strife and death of people. I liked the descriptions of the surroundings but not the people because it seemed as if most of them were selfish and mean.All in all I didn't like it and I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Two stars solely for the subject matter.,"I'll start by admiting that I typically do not read ""historical fiction,"" but read this out of an interest in the Chesapeake Bay. Michener seems to have begun this book with a list of (worthy) Chesapeake-related things to highlight, such as crab cakes, skipjacks, Labrador Retrievers, and the natural beauty of estuarine wetlands, and created generations of one-dimensional characters (e.g., inbred swamp-dwelling white trash and pure-hearted Quakers) and an overbearingly moralistic plot to tell how they came to be. Also, the editing of this book is pathetic -- poor grammar and misuse of ""big"" words are rampant. I much prefer the historical writing of Madison Smartt Bell (All Soul's Rising) and T.C. Boyle (World's End - only semi-historical). If this book had been about something I wasn't interested in, like... New Jersey, I never could have finished it."
4,"Classic Michener, but","Classic Michener: rich, vivid stories woven together, carrying the reader through the passage of time, but the writing fades and loses its edge about three quarters of the way through the book. Four instead of five stars."
5,Recommended,I enjoyed this book. Mr. Michener is a good writer who developers characters well. His descriptions are right on. He paints a great picture of the locations and the period he writes about.
5,Improper use?,"So one day I was at work and my glasses had some smudge on them that were making it a pain to do my work. I asked my boss for some lens cleaner and he goes and gets me these. Let me say this, my glasses have never been cleaner. To be honest I was amazed. It was like they were brand new after using this."
5,Brilliant and sensitive,Brilliant and sensitive. I feel transported to the time and place of thesewonderful poets. I highly recommend this and his series of 100 poems booksfrom Japan and China.
2,Flaking After a Year,"This looks great. For a few months. The finish, which seems to be painted onto the metal shape, started flaking off in large chunks in less than a year. It didn't even make it through the summer. We don't have rain during San Francisco summers AND it was in an enclosed garden."
3,Beautiful Sunflower Spinner,Pros:1. Beautiful design.2. Good size.3. Quality built.Cons:1. Only two year limited warranty against rust.2. Expensive item.3. Expensive shipping.4. No S hook; only a ring hook.
4,really pretty bling!,"Got these earrings for my girlfriend, she loved them.They look awesome! Only problem so far is the backs are so small that one pulled through. Maybe need to buy a bigger backs."
5,Plenty of ideas.,"From yogurt bread to yogurt cheese, chock full of recipes.I tried a desert which required making yogurt cheese which takes 2 days of draining a quart of yogurt in the fridge.Then you use non-flavored gelatin. The end result goes into glasses in the fridge. It was quite a project but fun to do. Highly recomend book to yogurt lovers and makers. The name of the recipe is Coffee Mousse."
2,Disappointing cookbook,"After reading other reviews, I expected a lot more from this cookbook. Rather than a book of unique recipes using yogurt as a key ingredient, too many of them offer a recipe plus a basic sauce using yogurt to augment the dish. Not sure what prompted so many positive reviews..."
2,The Book of Yogurt,"Probably my fault for not looking at text more, but I was dissappointed by this book. I had hoped to find something more about the making of different sytles of yogurt - this is NOT that book. There may be about two pages on making yogurt, the remainder of the book is an eclectic set of yogurt recipes. I have attempted two different cake recipes in the bbok - one came out great, the other was a nearly inedible flop."
4,More than I thought it would be....,"Bought this for my daughter to accompany a yogurt maker. I thought the purchase was for recipies for ""making"" different yogurt products. It is but, also a cookbook of recipies from around the world ""using"" yogurt. Easy to read and follow format. Those I have personally tried are very good!"
2,No pictures!!,"I do not like cooking books that do not have pictures. Plus I was looking for a book to describe how to make yogurts, not how to cook with yogurt!. I had to return it..."
3,THE BOOK OF YOGURT,"I was hoping for some photos and more basic ideas...this is really a recipe book, which is OK, but not what I'm after as a new yogurt maker. This book was recommended to go with my new Yogurt Maker, but I'm looking for something more informative and possibly more ""fun."""
2,not so good,its not what i wanted. it did not have recipes on how to make yogurt. only how to use it .
4,I'd recommend this,"I have always despised anthropologists. They think they know more about Indians than real Indians do, and, as the recent Kennewick man case proves, anthropologists oftentimes end up having to retract previous statements due to frauds. Even today, many academics assume that Chatters' retraction doesn't prove there WEREN'T Caucasians here before Indians. Quite absurd, since Kennewick man was the only evidence favoring such a claim.Today, anthropologists will refer to the Bering Strait theory, as if it were already proven. But the fact is, if you use one theory to support another theory, you must prove both theories, something they aren't prepared to do."
4,Amazing!,"This book is great! It makes so much sense about many things I used to question in our mostly boring science class. Once we were giants, CO2 has a bearing on growth, mammoths were alive in modern history, comets dumped snow, etc., and best of all: The Bering bridge is lie and so is the La Brea tar pits, and evolution is not tied up in a tidy package. I love it! I've read some of Vine's other books and I think he's hit the nail on the head here. Kids, take this book to school and watch your science teacher come all unglued!"
1,Red earth----red lies,"Vine delora show his dishonesty and ignorance of science. Using arguements that christian creationists' like duane gish and henry morris have resorted to for years. He doesn't understand that these arguements don't look any better or more honest coming from the left than they did coming from the right. He talks about ""western"" science as though he thinks that term has any meaning. Wouldn't somethings that's true in the west, be true all over the world? Is that bouncing up and down the transendental meditation people do ""Vedic aviation""? It's sad to see what postmodern subjectism is doing to the College campus and education of american youth today. The left can do better than this!"
1,Incredible postmodern nonsense,"I can't believe that anybody could take this book seriously. How could anybody in thier right mind think that all speculation should be given equal wieght? IF all ideas have equal wieght then no idea's have any wieght at all. Science isn't about pretending that all idea's are just as valid as all other ideas, but about finding out what is likly to be true based on evidence. This book is nothing more than Mr.deloria's retreat into his own private idaho. His idea's don't even make sense. Grow up!"
4,Confabulatory Realism,"Something told me I should read this book. What had initially caught my attention were the news stories about Jones and her husband. But the descriptions I was reading of The Healing also made me curious, and when I read the first page of the book, I immediately found better reasons for wanting to read it. I enjoyed the time I spent privileged to overhear the constant chatter passing through main character Harlan Jane Eagleton's head, repetitions and all. I laughed at the long, omnivorous reading lists put together by her client Joan. (I recognized some of my friends and myself in that.) This is a very funny book, a mythic--a confabulatory--tale written with a great deal of literary sophistication. And if you like this one, make sure you read Mosquito too."
5,"Remember, the FBI is watching.","I have not read this book, not under this name. But, if you plan to read it, I recommend you buy it at a bookstore where you don't have to give your name. Remember, the FBI is watching."
4,digital photo of your face in driver licence computer !!!!!!,great for its day but now ya face is on file in the dvlc computer and you know how small a jpg is so use a disguse when ya go its gona give fbi a hardtime :)
3,"Thin, a bit out-dated, but all the necessary facts are there","The stories are almost as thin as the book, but most of the necessary facts are there, and they still work. If you're a Paper Trip fan, save yourself a few bucks by getting this one instead. Same info but with less BS and padding, and at least 10 years more recent. (Still 12 years old, though.)"
3,a public service,This is an excellent reference book for those contemplating a disappearance or as a gift for deserving individuals. I just sent a copy to Justin Bieber.
4,"watch your back, you never know who's there",I found this book pretty inspiring and I could personally relate to some of the content which has happened to me within the past year or so.
5,Excellent condition great easy seller A+++,"great service, quick shipping item was in excellent condition description was exact i would recommend to anyone"
2,Teaches you how to run the setup wizard,Since the wizard is pretty straight forward the book wasn't much use. I would have liked more discussion of when to use the default and when to customize.The book advises a minimum 8 gb system drive. Even with Exchange et al on another partition the updates eat up most of the 8 gb quickly causing performance problems. I suggest 14-16 gb wth hard drives so cheap and the time wasted if you have to repartition.Another place the book recommends the hard drive be at least 2 gb. That may be the minimum per MS but the author should provide realistic minimums.
5,Superbly organized and presented instructional guide,"Susan Snedaker's superbly organized and presented instructional guide, How To Cheat At Managing Windows Small Business Server 2003, is a recommended pick for any Microsoft system engineer managing a Windows Server 2003 environment: it tells how to overcome common problems and time drains that Exchange Server creates, such as handling user permissions and security settings, and it also covers group policy, installing printers, managing client computers, and more. The disaster planning portion is particularly well detailed."
4,"Clever, skillful, and entertaining","John Morressy's Kedrigern books have long been a hard-to-find favorite of mine, and I'm thrilled to see them republished in this form. Morressy is a very skilled writer, and he deserves to have a wider audience. Even for those who are not fans of ""fantasy,"" Morressy's clever, multilayered humor, entertaining plots, and fantastical, yet familiar and believable characters transcend that genre. Kedrigern is a real gem of a creation.(I can't say I cared for the cover art, though.)"
3,Didn't care for the book,I found the book boring and somewhat predictable. I wouldn't recommend it for adults but perhaps it would make a good childrens book.
5,Tell Me What to Eat If I Have Acid Reflux,"This book is very good; it has handy hints like, chewing gum after eating for 1 hour can assist in reducing the time that stomach acid is in contact with the oesophagus. The book is about suggesting what could work for you; at the same time telling you that it is really all trial and error.Having had oesophageal cancer and the operation but still having the reflux problem this is one book that I would recommend for all like me to read."
3,Misleading Title,"I found the title very misleading. I had hoped to find the book filled with explanations on what types of foods are best for acid reflux and what types of foods you can substitute when recipes call for acid triggers, but that wasn't what this book was about. While it is a good book, filled with logical information, it's not what the title suggests. That said, it goes into what acid reflux is, why exercise and proper nutrition are so important for acid reflux sufferes, how to eat at restaurants, and it gives several recipes."
2,Ho Hum,I am having a swell time trying to deal with my reflux and relieve so that I don't have to get more tests and who knows what done. This book was just the same old thing for me. It really didn't tell me anything I didn't already read on the internet or whatnot. If you are clueless about the problem then this may help you but it was very repitious and ended bad. There were some recipes in it... like usual most sounded grosse. Mostly the book didn't tell you anything you don't already know and didn't help with the eating thing either! So I am still looking.
4,great start,"I really like this book. It is stacked with vital information about how to take care of your stomach so your acid reflux does not turn difficult or dangerous. It tells you MUCH MORE any doctor will and the recipes I tried are pretty good, which is a added plus!"
1,Useless,"There are few purchases I regret as swiftly and completely as this book. This book is perfect for the person who has acid reflux and is not really interested in changing their diet or lifestyle to improve their health. The recommendations in this book can easily be found using basic search techniques (for free). The recipes are awful: ""Mock KFC Coleslaw"" Really?? The author whines about being a ""Diet-Pepsi a day"" person, and frequently laments the lack of peppermint and chocolate. Get over it! If you are a person who is truly interested in healing yourself, skip this book. I orderedNatural Alternatives to Nexium, Maalox, Tagamet, Prilosec & Other Acid Blockers: What to Use to Relieve Acid Reflux, Heartburn, and Gastric Ailmentsat the same time. I do recommend that book. It thoroughly describes the many factors that contribute to the cause and the resolution of acid reflux."
3,Tell Me What to Do if I have Acid Reflux,Little disappointed in the book. They need to list more things individually that you should/or should not eat with Acid Reflux instead of so many recipes. I did get a few ideas but thought there would be more individua foods.
4,Tell Me What to Eat if I have Acid Reflux,"I think this is a very comprehensive report on reflux problems. I have a sonwith Barrett's Esophagus and he seems to ignore the importance of diet. He eatsfast food often and does not pretend to be on a diet. I bought this as a gift for him and think it will help him immensely.It goes all the way, explaining the different drugs and their benefits. The menusare a big help for those who want to prepare meals at home.It is well worth the price, in my opinion."
1,Waste of money,"If there was a zero star I would have given that rating to this book. I'm sure there is a flyer at the doctors office with just as much information as this book has in it. It defines GERD and then tells you to eat small meals, not eat before bed, not drink coffee and that's about it. The rest is recipes."
3,paper back book,for being a paper back book it was in fair conition and im satisfied since the book was not brand new and the price was great!
4,For People Who are Beyond Histograms and F Stop,Freeman is renowned for his ability to convey photographic knowledge. The complaints from the other commenters show that they're not familiar with his books. They should look into his other writings for more basic knowledge and take from this book what it is...information for people who aren't looking for basics but beyond basics.
1,designed backwards,"Don't trust the picture. When worn properly, this holster puts the handle of the gun toward your back, so that it can't be drawn from the holster without doing some strange contortions. It should have the grip facing foward, along your left side, to be drawn easily with the right hand, but they designed mine so that the grip protrudes behind you where you can't reach it with either hand. It doesn't work for costume purposes. The only way to get the gun to face the right way is to wear it on the right side (putting the straps across your chest instead of your back, obviously wrong and stupid-looking) or wear it inside-out with the the fake leather on the inside, which looks even worse."
2,not right color,"this guitar was not metallic pink, it is an orange/red metallic guitar. very upset cause i could get a red guitar anywhere, i wanted pink REAL PINK!"
3,it's better as a coster,"working on something similar, i found this book very helpful; for what not to do. yes the quotes are funny, but they're set in these color boxes with wacky colored text, like a failed color study. true, Judith Henry wants to keep the book interesting, and for that all she needs are good pictures. Judith Henry, should read ""Inside the White Cube"" again to remind her of the class strugle that ""high art"" perpetuates. sorry. la lucha continua"
3,Spoiler alert = This movie is not good !,"This movie is not good.But the script is so bad it is funny.This is a B Movie.These are some Mega Piranha that are so tough that even Nuclear weapons cant kill them. Given that fact...the lead character says he needs 5 minutes with them to finish them off personally It's insanely stupid , but funny as hell.If you watch the movie the director got excited with the lead character and kept showing him shift what appeared to be an automatic transmission ...lol I found the scene so silly it was funny.Enjoy this bad movie as it does have some pretty funny unintended moments."
5,One of the Greatest SyFy Movies EVER!,"Definitely buy this movie, it is great when you have a bunch of random people over and don't know what to watch. The acting is horrible and the plot is just as bad...but bad in the SyFy world equals AWESOME!Even better a 80's child star is in it! Tiffany!"
4,Best Comedy of the Year,"In all seriousness, I highly suggest purchasing this movie, especially considering the price. This movie takes ""It's so bad it's good"" to a whole new level. I was laughing with very little downtime for nearly the entire duration of the movie. Make sure not to watch this movie while eating, as most of it will be choked on or laughed up.The acting is a glimmering example of awfulness almost globally throughout the film. My favorites are the female submarine mate, who is so attractive it almost makes you forget what you're watching, and the captain of the Navy vessel, whose stone cold demeanor is entrancing to say the least.Watch with friends who also possess a healthy sense of humor, and this will be a wonderful experience you won't soon forget."
2,""" A GREAT MOVIE ""","THIS IS SUCH A GREAT MOVIE THAT I SAY IT SHOULD BE NOMINATED FOR SOME KIND OF ADWARD, OR SOMETHING.PLEASE EXCUSE ME, I NEED TO TAKE MY MEDS NOW."
3,Just look at the cover...,"I saw it, i laughed, and i wondered why Tiffany hadn't tried dieting before filming started. This is meant to be ridiculous fun and it works on that level."
2,Mega disappointment.,I bought this movie because I'm a fan of the singer Tiffany. Unless your a die hard Tiffany fan I recommend that you stay away from this dvd. The special effects are lame and the acting is subpar at best.
1,Komplete Break,"The tracks in this collection are nothing at all like the lively, fun, Kraftwerk-esque creations found on the ""Komputer"" CD, which I would give 5 stars. I only listened to it once (tried to listen to it twice) and was sorely disappointed. These dark experiments with noise and audio processing effects might have an audience, somewhere. When an artist or group makes such a profound change in their sound from one release to another it should be proclaimed prominently and sample tracks of the new efforts should be available so that fans don't waste their money."
5,From a Whitman Alum!,"This book made me homesick for Walla Walla! I could picture myself walking down Main Street with Sam and having a cup of coffee at Merchants. After trying to pick a favorite part, I realized that there are too many! A comment on the single Walla: My friends and I refer to it as Wa2 (Wa3 for Walla Walla, Washington) which is significantly faster than typing Walla Walla in emails.Can't wait to read Bottled Walla!"
3,Damm Good Fights,"everything was really good, myself and my home boys are still talking about the fights, man those guys are like machines"
4,UFC ULTIMATE KNOCKOUTS,"The fights are awesome in BluRay and I like skipping through all the hoopala soem time and just watching some of these professional fighters do what they do best.I quit watching boxing many years ago due to all the corruption involved. UFC fighting is real and WAY better than the usual ""boxing"" where the promoters and people behind the scenes control who wins. Thanks, Jim McDaniel"
2,not worth the money,The paints included do not wash out of fabrics and leave permanent stains. Plus they are watery. The brushes work just ok. The shaped sponges don't work at all. I am very disappointed in this item.
1,"No budget waste of film, way beyond BAD","This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I am a little embarrassed to admitI rented this no budget piece of dreck. I was hopeful of seeing some quality skin fromsome biker chicks. This film has no plot, the acting is awful, the music is bad and thebabes just are not very hot. I'm not sure how much money (if any) was spent making thisfilm but I know I sure would like the $2.99 I spent on the VOD rental back."
2,Three Days of Rain Makes a Dreary Read,"I bought Three Days of Rain after having seen a professional staging of the play in which I left unsatisfied, partly because, while it was brilliantly acted, I couldn't catch all the dialogue and blamed myself for not being impressed by the play. But after reading it, missing much of the dialogue seems like a benefit.Joseph P. Ritz, author of ""I Never Looked for My Mother and Other Regrets of a Journalist."""
3,Three Days of Rain,A very well written play - interesting to look at the present and past and how it affects who we are. I can't wait to see how this translate to the Broadway stage. How Julia Roberts plays her part.
2,Rich kids have Angst too,"This is a very well written play. The problems were not dramatic enough though. I mean, breaking up a famous Father's estate, finding out Mr. Soap Star/family friend slept with your sister, having to choose between two talented architects, are not big problems that a drama like this demands.Yet the family history is mesmerizing."
2,Clip broke off-- twice,"Beautiful looking pen, good writing utensil. Unfortunately the clip fatigues easily. I had one pen for two weeks before the clip broke off. The second pen-- a month."
5,Great pen!,"Great pen. I own many cross pens, but hadn't purchased an Apogee yet. I looked at the frosty steel and titan red, but decided on the frosty steel. So far, it's great. The weight is really good and the overall look is excellent."
5,Very Satisfied,"The Roller is beautiful. Very well finished, correct weight, good balance and feel very fine.Wonderful item for the price. Would buy it again!"
5,One of the Best Aviation Books Around,"The perfect compliment to ""The Right Stuff"", it is a realistic look at what it takes to be a test pilot. Bridgeman doesn't discuss the hero pilot angle, but does talk about the hard work, the struggle to understand and apply new engineering concepts, and the fear and tension that goes along with a test program. Very educational for any aviator or history buff.Bil Bridgeman died in the late 60's flying a Gruman flying boat."
5,My favourite beading book,"I have a lot of beading books and this is my favorite. I love the author's style and have found so much inspiration in this book. There's also good, detailed information for beginners."
5,LOVE my Uggs- Rainier fits just right!,"I was a little worried when a previous reviewer posted that these were super tight (especially boasting a size 10 foot), but I went ahead and picked up a pair anyway. My foot slid right in without a problem and there is plenty of room to wiggle my toes and enjoy the plushness of the Ugg sheapskin ""sock."" The ankle/calf is plenty roomy to tuck in your pants and show off all that awesome shearling fur! If ever there were a downside to this particular boot, it would be that the insole is not removable like the classic Uggs (hence the reference to the ""sock""). So, once you've worn them and loved them, you'll have a worn down insole that you can't just swap out for a brand new one. But, it's an excuse to buy new boots in a year or two...like you need an excuse!"
5,LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!!,"My mom bought these boots for me last winter at the end of the season and I couldn't wait to wear them this winter!! I get constant compliments on them and I ordered a 10 based on a previous reviewer's suggestion. They are roomy, super-comfortable and so warm!! They will literally send warmth to your entire body. Love them!!Ugg WOMENS RAINIER"
1,TOO TIGHT,"I have to return this boot, way too tight to get on my foot. Even got someone younger and thinner than me and she had a hard time getting this boot on her foot. And a little too furry, don't like the look of all the fur."
5,S.Nagpal : An amazing piece of fictional work!!,"Harper Lee both amazes and enthralls with this work of fiction, that offers a fresh new perspective to the world of story telling. This book is unique in the way it seeks to offer an unbiased, innocent & yet - thought provoking view of the social world. With amazing grace, the author highlights the subtle as well as the explicit racial divides that manifest themselves in daily life. What makes the book particularly delightful is the fact that the author relates incidents as seen by the eyes of a young girl - whose thoughts are yet original & as yet untarnished by the divides of the adult world around her. The reader cannot help but be moved by this piece of work. A must read!"
5,This book grabbed me and pulled me into it's exciting pages.,"To Kill A Mocking Bird was by far the best book I read this year. Harper Lee has extrordinary talent that could be identified as soon as you've even finished the first page. The small southern town where the story took place was the home of bigotry and all forms of racism. The two children in the story, Jem and Scout lived so innocently. After I finished the book I finall realized that Tom Robinson symbolixed the Mockingbird who harms knowone and therefore should mot be killed."
4,"Sad, funny, and Sad","Scout's father, Atticus, does all he can to try to prove the african american not guilty, but it doesn't turn out to be the best happy ending."
5,REad it it is great,this book is great! it tells us that even after slavery ended blacks are stil treated unfairly. If you think it is Going to be hard to read don't worry about it. i am only in the 7 grade and i totally understood .
2,Not all that great.,"I don't see what people really like in this book. I see the importance of talking about prejuduce in this book, which I think was well written about, but the rest didn't make for a very good book. I really didn't get into the book, which is very unusuall for me. I think though it is a good idea for people to read but I would never read this book agian."
4,What I Think,"When i first read To Kill a Mocking Bird I was in 8th grade. The book was very interesting and even though it took place in the early years it still was a great book. After reading the book we broke off in groups and we had to do skits from the book so that made the book even more interesting. The book also edcuated you because it taught you how people in those days lives and acted, that was a good experience."
3,To kill A Mocking Bird,The Radley Family next door is the most suspicious house is the town. Not a single African American will pass by the house. It's thought to be the source of all the crimes but what really goes on there? Scout begins telling you about his brothers accident and about how it all started the summer Dill came. THis book is for middle school and up. The genre is sort of a mystery and is a reality book. Enjoy it if you like fast paced action.
3,"Not Bad, Not Good","Actually I had to read it for school and it is a complicated book, difficult to understand. But well is a good book but a little large and boring."
1,Hated It!,This was the worst book ever I. I only read it because I was fourced to in highschool. Anyone who likes this doesnt know anything about American literature!
5,One of the most poignant story of our time,"A beautiful story as seen through the eyes of an innocentchild who cannot fathom the unrealities that supposedly moremature and wiser people create around themselves. Racialdiscrimination and prejudice just doesn't make sense to thislitle child, for to her everyone is but human."
5,racism does hurt others beside the one it is appointed to,This book is a great one. the life of scout is awsome.This kid and jem and dill were cool too.I really like how boo saves the day
4,A nice CD of traditional flamenco,"This CD offers a nice cross section of flamenco singing, guitar playing and dancing by some of the art's greatest performers. Ramon Montoya, Nino Ricardo, Paco Aguilera, Melchor de Marchena and Luis Maravilla are present here and their playing shows why they're among the elite interpreters of flamenco's storied past. Manuel Vallejo and Pepe Pinto sing with great passion and duende and their accompanists on the guitar display the skill and collaboration that make accompanying the cante a forgotten and underappreciated art form. Montoya's genius is displayed here, with his lyrical and beautiful variations while Ricardo's rougher but earthy attack was a style that was copied by many guitar accompanists of the late 1940s and early 1950s. The sound quality throughout is okay, considering the passage of time when these tracks were recorded."
5,The Godfather of Rhetoric,"Bruffee began to be studied in the early 80s and his work holds up to the needs of students today. If you want essential development of argument and persuasion, this is the book for you. I used it as a model for a college writing compentency preparatory program and the model is still being used today with great results. The model was also adapted by many educators at many levels with success. It introduced critical thinking and helped students quickly organize their thinking for a variety of writing tasks. There's also a great section on why b.s. gets good grades sometimes. I love it and haven't found anything more concise and practical for helping students write essays."
5,Cordless Phone Batteries,"The batteries were fresh and powered the phones before they were even charged. In my experience, that is unusual for online battery orders."
4,ManGirdle,"Purchased this for a gift. The receiver did like the gift, but said it could have been a size larger. It also rubs a little between the legs. Overall, I think he was satisfied with it."
5,Beautiful China pattern!,This China is some of the most beautiful I have ever seen! The price is very reasonable as well and it was shipped excellently and quickly.
4,I really enjoyed these peanuts,Oh My.....!!!I love these Virginia Diner brand peanuts...and heres the first ones that I have tried that are Butter toasted.....deliciously Butter Toasted in a sweet ( but no too sweet !!) buttery coating.Virginia Diner nuts are my favorite..they feature a very large peanut...that is always nice and crunchy..the way that I feel a fesh peanut should taste...not the greasy soft peanut that you get from other brands.Anyway--here the toppings are just perfect...and I could roll them around on my tongue for quite a while before they'd begin to melt.I love em...and I hope that you will too !!
2,Butter Toasted?,They were tasty but either old or stale as they were all stuck together. Wasn't exactly what we expected as they were called butter toasted and were more like toffee coated. The can was also hard to open.
5,Great Order,Came in just as it was described. Book was in great condition and I am very happy with this purchase
3,Poor image quality,"The content is riveting because of its historical importance, but the image quality of this dvd is pretty bad. Don't know whether the problem is with the original or in the transfer to dvd. You may want to wait for the dvd release of Sandra Schulberg's reconstructed film ""Nuremberg,"" which was released as a film in 2010 and is to be made into a dvd. It is supposed to have superior image quality, having been made from a previously missing German print."
5,Excellent!,"This reference is exactly what I have been looking for. I am studying Parasitology, Genetics, Anatomy, Physiology and other subjects related to medicine. I have searched high and low for a good reference fro both Greek and Latin roots. This book has almost everything I have looked up. I highly recommend this to anyone else who is curious about etymology. Also, It works great for me (and probably other students) because I have an easier time remembering scientific words when I can translate the roots, prefixes, and suffixes."
5,Childhood favorite,"This is one of the books I first read when I was a child. On each page the reader is rooting for poor Henry as the page ends ""no prize for Henry"", but alas! He finally wins in the end! Yaah, as my 2 year old would say."
5,Awesome condition,"For starters this movie was in really great condition! I don't know why initially I thought this was a book. However, when I received it I got a movie! Really glad I got it. This movie is so underrated, and I'm really glad I got a chance to see this movie! Also, for it to be as cheap as it was it was in really good condition! Glad I could add this movie to my collection ;)"
2,it was recorded in 1995!!!,"Never buy an income tax study guid that old, esp for $45+. The lecture itself is reasonably thorough and author's voice was acceptable, but half the information was outrageously out of date. Having said that, I used it to catch up on income tax stuff in preparation for a corporate tax class, and that worked out okay."
2,Not that hot.,This is a bulky battery with a short halfe-life. In my experience the original Canon batteries fared better in the long run.
5,Around the Corner (The Ginn Basic Readers),"Wonderful non politically correct reading book. Quite refreshing actually, and great for home school. Nice to see this on Amazon! Dates back to the days we were taught mostly how to think and not what to think!"
2,Fairly poor fantasy,"I wasn't a huge fan of Aurian, but wanted to see where the series ended up. Unfortunately, this book suffers from the same problems as the first. Anyone who has ever had to write an essay/story has been told ""show, don't tell"". Unfortunately Furey never figures this out. We are told characters are mad/evil/in love without ever seeing why. Additionally, I was annoyed that the title was Harp of Winds, when the Harp doesn't show up until the last 30 pages."
3,Plot heavy,Too many plots and sub plots in this second of the series. Getting hard to keep everything and everyone straight. Would have been better keeping all the subplots in a separate book and just getting on with it. It's too much like reading more than one book at the same time.
1,Average fantasy,"I found this book nice enough, but certainly not above average. It follows the usual fantasy clichees and the writer makes a decent job of it, with good and colorful descriptions. However, the people in the novel are less than convincing - especially in the really emotional scenes. The supporting cast are much more believable than for instance Aurian, the heroine. This is the main flaw of this novel and also the reason why I won't read any sequels to this book."
5,Once You Start You Can't Stop Reading!,"I Never read the first book but got the second one as a present from my mom for christmas. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. The Story pulls you in. The power lies in the fact it spins so many character and character lines together in a beautiful webbed story.Main characters are Aurian and her friend Anvar who struggle against the evil sorcerer Miathan and a terrible winter that was created by him to gain power over their entire world. Things look bad, because Aurian lost her magic, because she's pregnant from her old lover, but everything comes to an end in a Beautiful climax, which makes ur eyes glued to the last pages of the book, and make u feel sorry u finished the book.I can't wait to go to the store for the other parts of this cronicle..."
4,Skarlet's opinion,I thought it was great by it-self. It shows how the characters feel and how they think. Although it was only part of a really big picture. I reccomend this series only if you can handle long stories and can peice together the plot.
4,Truly a good book,"Although this is not AS good as the first book Aurian, it is still a very captivating and a must read! I love how Maggie Furey illustrates the books with words, especially the part where Anvar hears the harps and when it builds a star road for him! Absolutely wonderful!"
1,The worst money spent,Very grainy and dark because it was burned from the original VHS of years ago. You regret the first minute of viewership.Worst of all is Amazon requires me to give it a star to publish this review-DON'T BUY IT!
3,"A review of the ""Calico Cat Looks at Colors""","The Calico Cat books apparently fall into two groups. Those that are beginning readers, and those that are targeted to babies and toddlers. This book falls into the latter category.As a book about colors, it falls into a crowded arena. Everyone from Barney, Richard Scarry, and the Boohbahs have a finger in this pie.My advice: If your baby likes the Calico Cat series, you might take a look at this book. The drawings are large and bright and pleasant. Other than that this book isn't particularly better than the rest. In fact, it doesn't really cover many colors.Colors discussed are: purple, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. Ends with a color wheel and a rainbow.Three Stars. [C-]. We would not pay a bundle for this book."
1,one of the items received broken.,"One of the boxes was recieved broken. Also, containers don't seem very sturdy. I'm concerned as to how well they will hold up."
4,"Great tube picture, dated design but good quality","I bought mine in 2001, and have been generally happy with it. It's old, ancient in HD television terms, but has really held up great.Pros:- clear picture, even for standard def signals- good physical quality- good sound- well designed remoteCons:- Heavy, almost 200 lbs.- limited HD connections (one 1080i input)"
4,Very Good CD,"Boy...........do I miss this group. This was the last cd with the original three memebers. Though I feel Zagora is their best cd, this is a very close second. Almost every song is a smash and the ones that aren't, in the least are good. It's rare to find a group that conveys timeless music as LE's sound never sounds dated or faddish. I listent to this recording several times a week as it is programmed in my computer at work. It still stands the test of time."
5,Their funkiest album!!!!,"I thought that Loose Ends really topped themselves with this album! Their funkiest one to date, as Watching You just kicks the album off with a bang with its heavy beats! There's No Gratitude continues the funk vibe, before the three song The Real Chuckeeboo suite that includes the funky Mr. Bachelor in the middle! One other song I like is Life, which has such a driving groove within it. This was the last album with the original lineup, but they definitely showed their best on this album and kicked up the funk a notch! Carl McIntosh just had the funk in him on this album, before continuing with other members on the next album in '90. This album was just as funky as Bobby Brown's album in the same year of 1988! Musical, melodic, beat heavy and funky at the same time too!"
3,To complete the loose ends collection,"If you have the first two cds, get this cd. This the last one with singer and June Eugene and the other male singer. It has the long version of Mr. Bachelor."
5,Great Battery,I purchased this battery about a year ago for my Sony cordless phone. It has worked flawlessly.
5,Perfect. And I am picky about this sort of thing.,"I was a little skeptical, but other reviewers are right. These are just as great at chairs from Restoration Hardware and at a fantastic price. Love them. However, if you really want to lounge, I recommend buying an ottoman or small table to put your feet up on. That would make the whole thing perfection. Good job, Amazon.(Update, I just got the ottoman. Normally I don't like matchy-matchy sets, but it's perfect, the right height, etc. Seriously, get the ottoman. So nice and relaxing to put your feet up on. I also got the two-seater sofa. Really, really happy with the whole set.)Oh, and a word about the cushions. They do get smudge-y if, say, my dog jumps up with dusty paws, but wind, morning dew, rain... they all seem to wash the dust and dirt away pretty well. I find the cushions to be really low maintenance.)"
5,Love this line!,I bought 4 of the deep seat arm chairs for around our firepit and they look awesome! I also ordered a side table and the 3 cushion sofa. They are all great quality and look much more expensive then they are. I like the fact that they are off white because then they won't fade as much in the sun. I highly recommend this product line.
4,Defective finish on Strathwood Falkner lounge chairs,"A couple of years ago, I bought two of the lounge chairs with cushions and a table from Amazon. The chairs are comfortable. I keep the cushions inside so they have not deteriorated. But the finish on the arms of the chairs which I kept outside has peeled. The chairs still work, but I suspect that my arms would be scratched, if I rested them on the peeled surfaces. I would not recommend buying these chairs."
3,Good buy,"The design and price were excellent. My criticism is the color of the cushions. They're an attractive cream/pale yellow. But that's not what I need/want. So I will have to recover the cushions in a color that coordinates with my design scheme. As other reviewers have noted, the light color is difficult to keep clean. The other problem is that the seats are VERY deep. The chairs need an additional back cushion for guests shorter than 6-foot-10 (or so). Still, a good deal."
1,Flimsy product,"I bought the chairs and within weeks one of the legs had broken clean off, revealing how thin the aluminum used to make this line is. And how do you return one chair when the box is already gone without spending more than you paid for the chair? Total bummer. Don't buy this product"
5,Go ahead and click BUY!,"I am so thrilled with this product line that I just had to leave a positive review (somthing I've never felt stongly about before this). After spending hours/days/weeks online looking for a quality set I could afford, I finally found Strathwood's Falkner Collection. Each piece is welded throughout, no rivets or screws, and no assembly. The design is equally comparable to Frongate, Pottery Barn, and Ballard Designs. The cusions are well made, as long as you've resigned yourself to white and it's up-keep. I've purchased 9 pieces and couldn't be happier. In addition, I received the set within 5 days...an additional plus."
2,Strathwood lounges,"These chairs and two-seaters look nice, but the fabric is not waterproof and gets dirty very easily. As outdoor chairs/seaters, they do not work well. After two days outside, they were dirty and now all cushions will have to be replaced."
1,"Looks good, sits good, but weak construction, returned item","Initially very happy with our purchase. Chairs looked good and were very comfortable. However.... after a few weeks both chairs developed cracks in the frame (joints), one of which quickly developed causing one of the legs become unstable and ready to break off. Fortunately this fell within the first 30 days and Amazon arranged for a return. When trying to move chairs down from the roofdeck black liquid seeped out of the cracks of the chair causing significant stains on the carpet only adding to the frustration and disappointment.In short, my advice: don't buy this product, it's construction is inferior. And if you already own it, look carefully for cracks within the first few weeks."
4,Sitting pretty,"Very happy with our new chairs. They came quickly, well packed, in perfect condition and are great chairs at a very reasonable price. They are heavy enough not to blow away, but not too heavy to be difficult to move around. My one complaint comes from a review that i read about cleaning the cushion covers. When a bird decided to leave his mark on my brand new chair, I remembered reading that someone said they were easy to zip off and wash. Well...mine are tufted with a button, which made it impossible to zip off without ripping off the button. Bad design in my opinion. Either way, I'm loving sitting around the firepit on my new chairs!"
1,chairs never came,I ordered these chairs and the matching 3 seater sofa. The sofa arrived damaged. I informed the company of the defective item. I was instructed to wait for the trucking company to come get it.The chairs I never received and called amazon about the unreceived shipment. they were supposedly not shipped due to they were boken during shipment.I am waiting for my full refund. Amazon is charging me a fee for cancelling my order. They will not respond to my email inquirey.My sofa is still waiting for pick up. I have been charged on my charge account. I won't order anything from amazon if they do not respond to my request.1.damaged sofa to be picked up and credited.2.the shipping cancellation fee deducted from the full amount of the 2 chairs- I didn't receive.
3,"Elegant, inventive stories","Avrich is one of the few story scribes out there who's doing anything interesting with language. Standouts include ""Miss Carmichael's Funeral"" and ""Lady Macbeth, Prickly Pear Queen."" The fable-like voice allows her to take the reader to places as varied as Paris and Zanzibar."
1,An absolute bore.,"The stories are very boring with weak plots, no action, and no climax. The characters are shallow and without personality. The book is over 200 pages, but you'll probably be done with it after reading a couple dozen, ever-painful pages.I think I accidentally ordered this, because I can't see why I would ever buy it on purpose."
2,Excelsior!,"Since the book was written by Theodore Sturgeon, more or less, it's tempting to rate it as ""90% crap,"" but that's much too flip and not entirely fair either. As a comedy of lusty, brawling, rascally social climbing written in mid-20th century and set in the 18th, it's...undistinguished. As a *pastiche* of a comedy of lusty, brawling, rascally etc...well, its pastichity is really the only thing that distinguishes it. As Jean Shepherd's infamous ""Manifesto of the Night People,"" it frankly disappoints.I read this while convalescing from surgery. It is good enough for that, and it is possible that it reads better when consumed in robust good health."
5,An important read for parents as well as kids,"The Magic of Max not only tells a story of a lifestyle change but also gives insight on why Tommy Rome ended up overweight and why Max Logan is healthy. This is an uplifting story about how to embrace change and that there are role models all around us, even right next door. This books is gentle and positive. It never blames or shames and thus is a good read no matter how down you feel."
1,Beware!,These cd-r's are not worth a damn! I would have given them a zero but it was not on the scale. Only about half of the 50 were useable. The other 25 simply could not be recorded on. I have a brand new professional HHBCDR-830 so i knew it was not the recorder. I bought a 50 pack of HHB cd-r's and have not had one bad one in the lot. Do not buy these discs for they are junk!
1,Does not Work Well,"If you are planning on using this program to copy your new DVD's that you just bought at the store to your ipod's or psp's you might want to consider a different program. This program, although it says it will, it most definitely will not transfer your Hollywood DVD's to your ipod or psp. It will not decode the DVD's in order to transfer them to your ipod or psp. If it is a Hollywood DVD, which most of my DVD's are, then it most likely will not even let you try to transfer the DVD because of the fact that the DVD is encoded. I highly recommend not buying this program."
2,Only 100 Colleges? Barely Scratches the Surface.,"After reading this book I'm not sure why it's listed as a college guide. It only lists 100 colleges and I had never heard of most of them. Best Distance Learning Graduate Schools lists 195, and that's just graduate schools. Peterson's includes satellite and cable and lists many more accredited undergraduate colleges than this guide. I got the feeling that Bear just lists schools that he personally likes or that he maybe forgot to update the book in the last 5 years or so."
5,.......,"This cd is without a doubt the best cd I have ever owned. Every track is awesome, and the album in its entirity is perfect. The best tracks are probably Mouthful, Good People Check, and Hat In The Wind."
5,I depend on this knife,"This is an incredible knife. I had the first one over 20 years before I lost it. I immediately ordered the same one again. The knife is rugged, takes abuse and very handy. I find it to be the right size and tool mix for almost any situation. I would give 6 stars if I could."
5,Grandson gift,"The budding Boy Scout grandson really liked this gift. Wish it came with a scabbard or holster, though. Great knife."
4,"good math, but no simulations","The mathematical core of the book is impressively well-established, though hard to be fully understood. One who wants to get a good mathematical basis on the subject of spectral estimation should have this book. The main disadvantage is the lack of simulation results comparing methods or showing their pros/cons."
1,Not Good,"I usually do not take time to write a review. However, if you are considering using this book to teach a sensors course, do not! THere are multiple mistakes within the text, including grammatical errors and incorrect equations. The questions at the end of the chapter are good, however the answers in the back of the book are incorrect at least 25% of the time. The organiztion of the book is good for me, but until the errors are corrected, do not use this edition."
3,Hope you like VB,"I was very disappointed by this book. The information about each of the mail protocols was very light, and the books seemed to be mostly sample code listings. If you are totally unfamiliar with any of the protocols it may be useful, but if you are looking to do any real programming the book doesn't cover enough information to let you do proper design."
3,My 9 month old daughter isn't interested.,"I thought 9 month old daughter would love this shape sorter--since she loved Lamaze's Soft Clutch Cube. I think this toy is well designed and I love the colors and different sounds used for each shape. However, my daughter isn't interested. I think that I should have introduced this toy to her at the 3-6 mos. stage because she's really no longer interested in ""soft"" toys that don't make much noise. She prefers to bang and throw things, empty out my handbag or watch her Baby Einstein DVD series or Elmo. I think a better shapr sorter at this stage would be a traditional one that is not soft."
3,Fun to look at but that's about it,"Since it is so soft you can basically force any of the shapes through any of the holes. So, don't expect much educational value from this toy.My daughter did love chewing on the different shapes and that was fine by me. I'd rather have her chewing on cloth than plastic. Also, each shape makes a different sound and there is some texture to them. One has a bell inside, one crinkles like plastic, etc.It's a cute toy and my daughter played with it often but not for it's intended purpose. My guess is the things mentioned above in combination with the vibrant colors (which are great!) appealed to her more than anything else."
2,not a favorite toy,"We received this toy for Christmas last year when our daughter was three months old. I've offered the sorter to her several times in the past year but she has never really took an interest in this toy. She briefly enoyed playing with the shapes, but never found the sorter cube very entertaining. It's a cute toy, but I think the design is more of an attraction to parents than to children."
2,anything but a shape sorter,"The shapes do not easily fit through the holes of the sorter. My son played with the shapes themselves a little since each made noise; but other toys do that too. Also, although the patterns are pretty for adults, they are not consistent around the shape and just cause confusion for the older baby who is actually trying to match the shape. Overall, this is an overpriced but nice to look at toy whose goals (shape sorting) are better met by the harder plastic (and much cheaper) sorters. For tactile sensory goals it is as good as anything else you would buy (or make)."
2,It's ok,"My 8 month old isn't too into this toy. He likes the crinkly door that you can open to get the shapes out, but that's about it. Maybe when he's a little older."
2,Too soft...,"My daughter received this as a gift, and as an infant, she played with the shapes and box independently of one another. Now as a toddler, she ""sorts"" the shapes, but because the box is soft, she can force the square through the triangle, the triangle through the oval, etc., etc. She's not learning the shapes with this at all. I bought a wood ""puzzle"" sorter instead, and we've been much more successful with that."
2,Not that great,"The real problem? It's soft and any of the shapes can be put through any of the holes. Not teaching a whole lot when that happens. I think I'll go by the old inexpensive, hard plastic version instead."
2,Too big for little hands,"I bought this toy for my then six-month old daughter. It is very cute and she likes the colors and textures, but the shapes were too big for her to hold or manipulate. She became very frustrated with it. Now that she is fifteen months old, her hands are big enough and she has enough dexterity to handle the shapes, but she is no longer interested in it. She occasionally shakes the shapes that make noise, but that's really the only time she plays with it at all. I was disappointed in this toy, and I think it would have been much better if the shapes had been smaller. I also think it would be better if all the shapes fit inside all the holes more easily. When infants are the appropriate age to need a soft type of toy like this, they are not developed enough to truly understand the concept of ""sorting""."
1,Dust collector,This toy just sat on our shelf. My boy (now 2.5) received it as a gift when he was ~9 months. He has never been very interested in it. At best he opened the box's door and put the pieces in. The pieces themselves are too large to comfortably fit into an infant's hand. The pieces also do not fit into the appropriate openings easily enough for a young child to use the toy as a shape sorter. Often one piece will fit in numerous holes.
4,The soft sorter has great parent baby interaction potential!,My son and I play with this toy together. He loves the door with the velcro...and will put a shape in the box and then we both look in the side windows opposite eachother to see if the shape is actually in there....and we smile and laugh at each other with our face pressed up to the box. I can also put my hand in one of the holes and when he opens the velcro door...the hand pops out and tickles his tummy...and he laughs...and the hand pops back in and he closes the door...and then opens it again. Sometimes the hand will pull a shape in with it and my son will open the door looking for the shape. This is also a great toy for the car seat...since it is soft and would be safe in an accident.
3,fun shapes but does not work as a sorter,"The blocks with their bright patterns and different sounds are wonderful on their own, but because they are soft, they can easily fit into ANY of the openings (not just the appropriately shaped one), so this toy actually fails as a sorter. In this case, the original wooden (or plastic) version of this toy is necessary. Also, it took all of 30 seconds for our son to discover the easy top-flap access on this cube, thereby circumventing the entire 'sorting' process."
2,not a favorite toy,"We received this toy for Christmas last year when our daughter was three months old. She never really took an interest in this toy. She briefly enoyed playing with the shapes, but never found the sorter very entertaining. It's a cute toy, but I think the design was more of an attraction to parents than to a child."
1,as much about blck slavery as white slavery,"one thing is clear about this auther. he is an outright bigot. the constant comparison between the treatment of white slaves and black slaves is tired and redundant and totaly false. mr. hoffman should study black slavery. he seems ignorant of the starvation, beatings, working in freezing weather without proper clothing, beatings for learning to read or write, rape, given american names. and forced to become christians. (i could go on.) and then there is this never ending flap about chrispus attucks being indian or black. mr hoffman chose indian, i say look at his portait. i know that white slavery existed. the bible speaks of slavery, actualy seems to appove slavery. this is not the book for a serious studyof slavery white or black. mr hoffman want to make the case that black slaves were treated better than white slaves in america period."
3,Is this the book or did I get the author's notes by mistake?,"Very slim book for the price. Writing style is equally sparse. Lots of facts and quotes from historical sources, almost no context tying them together. Almost like geting a book on dinosaurs, and finding it consist only of an assemble-it-yourself Tyranosaurus skeleton, with no instructions. This reads like the author's research notes, waiting to be fleshed out. Facinating subject, excelient research, poor execution."
2,A diservice to an important subject,This guy is clearly a bigot. does really thinks slavery was about race. the constant comparisons between black and white. The guy did a diservice to this most important subject. I want my money back
1,Poorly researched,"This account of the so-called ""Barbary captives"" calls attention to a forgotten area of U.S. history, but the book is not well researched or well written. For a better analysis of Barbary captives' narratives (as well as several narratives) see Paul Baepler's anthology, White Slaves, African Masters. Robert Allison's The Crescent Obscured also has an informative chapter on Barbary captivity."
2,Received a wrong engine,"I received a wrong train, different from pictured. Other than that, it's a good value (for a DVD and an engine.)"
1,Disappointing!,"I ordered this for my 2 year old daughter who is obsessed with Thomas and music. The movie is not CGI and the songs are very slow. She didn't make it more than a few minutes in and she was bored and wanted to watch her other Thomas movies. From the what I saw/hear, there wasn't even the theme song."
4,Nice little DVD,"My two year old son LOVES all things Thomas, especially songs on DVD. This DVD is fairly short, only 30 minutes of songs. The songs are not any I recognize from many other Thomas videos. Despite that, my son is enraptured by this video. In general, I wouldn't buy this video if you're looking for good songs. I AM glad to own it for my son, though. He's very happy with it."
4,A Charming Book,"I will never look at a mailbox the same way again! Rachel Epstein has captured true American individuality and spirit through her camera lens. This book is a visual celebration of the wit, whimsy, and creativity of the American people. The only flaw with this book is that some of the mailbox origin stories pale in comparison to the lovely photographs. Still, it is a fun book that reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously."
3,Saga's Second,"A solid second effort from one of the most underrated progressive rock bands of the late 70s and early 80s. Still, it doesn't achieve the accessability of the later work. Strickly for hardcore Saga fans. The more casual fan should check out ""World's Apart"" or ""Heads or Tales""."
2,Only two good tracks.,"The rest is well below average. Good sound, great studio job, excellent mixing, but showing few or null music creativity.A pop-techno compilation from we can only mention track 6: Images (Chapter One) and track 8: Mouse In A MazeFortunately better works came from this band after this one.Ah... one more thing: 4 or 5 stars to the mixing engineer."
5,simply awsome and few like them,"Incredible epic-styled melodies, hard to believe their melodies are not more well known indeed, particularly the media, sports channels, etc. As one commenter said, they should have been a lot more popular. I prefer the early years myself, but I have to admitt I have not listened the newest stuff.Of the almost near or over a thousand of CD's from the 80's and 90's and beyond that I have, this group is one of the few groups I listen to all the time, and I know many rock bands !!! Your stereo eqipmente will sound incredible ! Trust me ! This band is amazing."
3,Are They Selling Their Soul?,"I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this is a good album, but not BR-549 at their best. The effects of the Dixie Chick's producer is evident in how ""flat"" the album sounds, but I have to admit this is the way all of their studio albums sound to me. To hear BR-549 at their best, get ""Live at Roberts"" or better yet go to one of their concerts. They kick A** live!!"
3,"Solid rockabilly, but nothing special.","When you hear the first cut, you have high hopes. ""Too Lazy to Work, Too Nervous to steal,"" is exactly what you're looking for: catchy tune, clever lyrics with a good sense of humor and solid playing. But they really only reach this height a few times; ""Psychic Lady"" works well and the Nick Lowe cover, ""Play That Fast Thing"" seems right up there alley; the rest of the CD is solid rockabilly but seems a bit staid and safe. This band always had a rep for playing it fast and loose and this really isn't reflective of that status."
4,An excellent tongue-in-cheek spin on Evil Incarnate,"Put together to look like a cute little coffee house quote book, complete with upsidedown and diagonal text, colors, jokes and cartoons, it's refreshing sometimes to step out of our seriousness and laugh at men like Saddam. He probably is the most dangerous man in the world, but when we can look at his ""wisdom"" we get to see a bit of his madness while we snicker at his would-be profundity. Also in this series are Khaddafy, Castro and Bin Laden. Collect them all."
2,Unhappy,"The batteries that came with my GE phone lasted for several years. So, with that expectation, I bought two of these as replacements. Unfortunately, after 13 months of working fine, one now refuses to hold a charge and I'm forced to discard it and find another. For the price, these batteries should last longer. I expected the Energizer brand to be better than that."
5,"Very satisfied so far about this battery fits my Motorola cordless phone, works as advertized","Battery lasts more than a week without charging. Talking for 45 minutes, only 1 bar down shown at the cordless phone. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a replacement battery. Good alternative than buying a new phone."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this Energizer battery about 3 months ago for my Motorola Ma361. I though that being a Ni-MHD battery it would last longer than the Ni-Cad it had before but I was wrong. My phone already signals a low battery & I haven't had it longer than 6 months. I even switched it to my other phone which uses the same cell battery & got the same results. I could probably send it back as a faulty battery but it doesn't seem worth the hassle. For better quality, stick to a higher end cordless battery."
4,The Energizer Bunny,"The energizer bunny has nothing on this battery pack. Where the retail shops couldn't help, this purchase solved my problem. It simply works. Enough said?"
3,"Size of battery in picture can be misleading, do not trust what it says it can fit as that is not always truthful.","For those that are unsure if this battery will fit your phone, here's a simple way to find out. If your current battery looks like 3 AAA batteries wrapped in plastic, do NOT order this battery. If yours looks like 3 AA batteries in wrapped in plastic, this battery will work with yours. The only exception to this is if your battery compartment has a lot of extra space to hold 3 AA batteries, so if you are unsure take 3 AA batteries and see if they will fit side by side in the compartment. If they can fit you can order this battery as a replacement if a normal replacement is not available. The connecter appears to be universal, so no issues there."
2,1 issue for the price of two!,"Although expensive, I decided to invest in this Australian subscription because I am a children's clothing designer. After 9 months went by without receiving my 1st issue, I called Amazon who called the distributor. They quickly sent me an issue. Three weeks later another issue arrived- a duplicate of the one I already had gotten. I'm just too busy to deal with this sort of thing, so I simply resolved never to order a foreign subscription again. The magazine was OK, but not worth $56.20 for one issue!"
4,It weighs how much!?,"I'm not sure what scale was used to measure this product, but the actual measurements are: 1 5/8"" x 1 1/8"" x 1/4""; wt: 1oz! The connection does fit my GE model 25951 phone, but it rattles around in it. I have to admit that I didn't pay close attention to the size/wt when I bought it. I assumed (oops)that if it said fit my phone, it actually fit my phone. However, it's a bit distracting when you hear the battery sliding around in the phone."
4,You get what you pay for,"I got this after buying the cheap batteries that didn't last a year. This battery pack is good so far. As the saying goes, sometimes you get what you pay for. Be leary of cheap batteries. I'd buy these again."
1,Sent Wrong Item,The picture on Amazon shows a black Energizer battery. Mine came as Lime Green just like the cheap penny batteries that I bought elsewhere that dont hold a charge. It is still in the package. Contacted company with no reply for an exchange for the correct battery.
4,Replacement for AT&T E597-1 Phone,This is the correct replacement for the AT&T E597-1 phone. Works fine so far.
5,Works very well,"I bought three packa of them to replace my Vtech phones after a long vacation without leaving three out of four on base. They worked better than the ones came with the phone. I like energizer's replacement battery. They normally beat the original. I own some for Sony camcorder and other devices too. One more point, it doesn't died completely after it drained. It recovered after my 18 month old left one of them under bed for don't know how long."
1,they sent the wrong watch,Looking at my email I thought something was wrong. You Guys sent me the wrong watch. You sent me the 607 not the 40400. I HAVE BEEN TO BUSY TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION!
3,for kids,"This is clearly a book for young adults or older kids. As such I find it brilliant in introducing criminal profiling.It never gets in to deep, and the reason for the three star rating is that it doesnt get beyond informing the reader.The book lacks questions for the reader to reflect upon, and though the subject is exciting, it doesnt inspire or challenge the reader."
2,Not what I thought...,"Very short and more for middle-school aged kids. Not worth the money, and I got it used."
1,Not really for adults,"This book is more for jr high kids. For them I suppose it would get a higher star rating. But for me, very dissapointed."
2,"Only worth the pictures, not the content","The pictures were beautiful, but I was looking for a book with more information on the history of the breed. The book read more like a childrens book, very little text and a lot of pictures. I was very dissapointed and returned it as a result."
3,"Just pictures, no relevant text","This is just a picture book... I bought it, looked at the pictures, and resold it on ebay since I have a pasture full of the same pictures. The pictures are nice, if that is all you are looking for, but there aren't all that many of them. This is more of a children's book."
2,Arrived scratched.,This is the type of thing that makes sense to buy locally. The box it's shipped in is not made for single piece shipping. These normally get shipped 10-12 on a skid to a store. They are packed for that purpose. The box arrived with 2 corners ripped and large parts of the board scratched. Amazon for their part gave a quick refund and covered return shipping. Good customer service. I ended up buying the backboard at a local retailer for 10.00 more than amazon. Good quality backboard. Just buy it locally.
4,Good replacement,"After the original board started cracking and eventual felt apart. I got this replacement. So far everything is good, not much complaint."
2,"Poor quality - First one arrives broken, second one falls apart","The first one of these I received was broken - the clear acrylic backboard sheet (like plexiglass) was broken in one corner, and was scratched in several other places.Amazon sent a replacement, which was in better shape.On both of them, the actual backboard material is much thinner than I expected - it looks like 1/4 inch clear plexiglass type material. I was expecting something much thicker and more robust. overall fit and finish was poor on both the original unit they sent as well as the replacement - the paint on the backboard itself and on the frame were both poorly applied.The rim seems to be much better quality than the backboard and frame.To add insult to injury, after being up for about four months, (in our relatively mild California climate) the backboard Plexiglass came unglued from the frame. Fixable, but a big pain.Net is poor quality, twice over..."
4,"Great looking, great price.","I bought this backboard to replace a broken portable unit I was given. It fit great. The backboard is very nice looking, and gives a decent amount of bounce to the ball.(Not glass, but for $199.00 very good.) The item arrived very quickly.(I chose free shipping from Amazon.) There was a missing backboard pad. I called Spalding and they got the part out right away. I would purchase from Spalding again."
4,Really good but not perfect,"I only gave it four stars for one reason. It is hard to find a good mounting bracket for it. I purchased a huffy bracket and it took some washers and a hacksaw to make it fit. (different review all together). As for the backboard and rim it is a really good out door unit for the price. It is lively but not super rigid, I haven't dunked on it yet (and probably never will, after all I'm 35 and white ((sometimes its true we really can't jump, sometimes!!)). All joking aside it feels strong but its not nearly as heavy duty as an official hoop. I would buy it again. I really bought it for my wife for her birthday and she loves it, thinks it looks great and ""official"""
1,Broke in 20 minutes,Cracked within 20 minutes of instulation with kids just playing normal BB. Replacement on order hope it last longer. Anyone else have such issues?
1,garbage,"This product was absoluite garbage. The first one showed up with a large scrtach across the backboard. We then sent it back, and made the mistake of not opening the new one until the weather got better. The second one had a basketball sized hole through the backboard. Now we have to send it back at our expense and only for partial credit. It will be easier to throw it in the garbage where it belongs. Incidentally, this was my first and will be my last Amazon experience. Note, I would have given this zero stars, but Amazon's system requires at least one star for the review to even post."
3,Great pictures; questionable research,"There is one really good reason to get this book: the pictures. Almost 50% of the pages have coloar photographs of primarily Eastern art. However, pictures aside, Camphausen states his goals early in the book then does not see them through as well as he could. While there are many rare facts covered there are also very commonly known terms, deities, and objects included. Most terms do not have references so we can't tell where the information was found. The bibliography is done well but without references how can one truly do extra research? The index is completely worthless because it just lists things under general categories but not the pages they appear on; yes, the terms are alphabetically done but really, is putting a page number too much to ask? So if you want some great pictures, this is a good way to get them. Luckily the price is good just for the pictures themselves."
1,Terrible...save your money,Don't bother with this waste of time and paper. Most of it seems to be made up crap. Any research into these items brings up pretty much nothing to do with sexuality. I think the author is one of those people that probably thinks tantra is about sex/sexuality when it has NOTHING to do with that.Many things I researched further came up with nothing or the slightest possible mention of anything that could be perceived as being sexual was added to this book. It could have been a 2 page handout.If there are 500 items in here...seriously...maybe 10 have some substance. The rest is made up crap.My copy is going to get donated to the bargain bin!
3,"interesting book, but.....","Although this is an interesting book, it contains only heterosexual entries and articles. Therefore, I think it is better that the title of the book should be changed into ""The Encyclopedia of Sacred Heterosexuality""."
4,Excellent pocket reference,"When traveling and studying abroad I had two dictionaries: a larger, more comprehensive one and this mini dictionary. I must say that this dictionary packs quite a punch given its small size. There were only a few times I can remember needing to look up a word in my larger dictionary because the word was not in this one. It makes an excellent travel companion striking the perfect balance between physical size and coverage of Portuguese vocabulary. I highly recommend this mini dictionary for anyone studying Portuguese and/or traveling to Portuguese-speaking countries.I feel that this dictionary would be a five-star product if the words were a separate color from their meanings to make them stand out just a little more and make locating them on the smaller pages that much quicker. Nevertheless you can't go wrong with this mini dictionary."
2,5 not 50,"There are some useful examples in this book, however there are certainly not 50! Many of the lighting setups shown are so similar it's hard to see any difference from one to the next. Most of the older b & w examples seem dangerously overexposed, again making each 'technique' undistinguishable. Some of the newer colour examples are quite out-of-focus which really doesn't help matters. I see this book more of a 'what not to do' guide. He manages to make one of the models look great in one shot, but gross in the next, and so forth. There are definately more useful, more up-to-date books that give better examples than this title."
4,Lights camera...,"This is a great book, not only does it show you how to set up your lights it gives you explanation to it to help you figure out lighting set ups on your own. A must have for anyone trying to set up a studio."
1,I found a book dedcated to hotlight photography to be dated!,"I found the book to be very disapointing because of the use of hotlights instead of flash. There also was no mention of settings, I think these days very few photographers rely on hotlights. The book was not relavant to todays portrait styles, I would have given this book a high rating if it would have been published 25 years ago, but today I would give it only a single star, I also was surprised at the authors lack of skill in the 3 or 4 photos that he tried to unsuccessfuly use flash, the photographs were overexposed, also there were shadows directly behind the subjects heads that no customer of mine would except. nor would I even show my customers such photos. shame on you John Hart!"
3,Basic Techniques for bland and sterile portraits,"Okay, this guy makes his living, according to the book, from doing head shots and studio portraits for actors and models who need samples for their portfolios.I won't say there's nothing to be learned from this book, as he does show, and carefully explain the techniques he is using, and shows examples of the pictures he wouldn't use and explains why, as well as the ones he would.However, the portraits are, for the most part, brightly lit, flat, hard edged and soulless. They look to me exactly like the kind of pictures I **don't** want to take of people in front of my camera. Sort of a primer for the Sears Studio Photography technique of portraiture. Yuck."
3,"CLAUDE BERRI, OPUS 8","**1/2 1977. Written and directed by Claude Berri. Two friends, Pierre and Jacques, drive to the Cte d'Azur with their teen daughters for vacation. One night, Pierre sleeps with his friend's daughter. Will he dare to speak the truth to Jacques ? Rather light comedy about summer love affairs in the pre-aids France. AfterLe Sex Shopand THE FIRST TIME, Claude Berri gets on with his study of French morals in the seventies. Average."
1,Did not work on me,"I love zoya, and the colors are amazing, however this base coat its horrible, it start to peel next day!!! I applied to very thin layers of polish, over this base coat and next day my nails peel like crazy. I also clean and was my hands before and apply alcohol to make sure they are clean and not oily.Very sad I got this product, I cannot recommend it"
4,"Great nail polish, a little pricey","This is great stuff. Since their market is in the alternative/nasty-chemical-free space it's hard to see a difference between this and other products, but I do know that in terms of lasting power it keeps up with pretty much any other brand. However, I have only used these products together (Anchor, color, and Armor) so I don't know how they would perform separately. Also I like that they are easy to clean (again, using Remove).It's pricey but I do my nails so infrequently that this bottle will easily last me two years, so I don't mind paying the premium."
1,Damaged my nails with long-term use,"This base coat stuck to my nails like glue and helped my Zoya polish stay on for about 5 days - but after a few months of using this as my only base coat, it started taking tiny chunks of my nail with it when I removed it! Yikes! I ended up switching to Chanel base coat and I'm really happy with it."
5,"A book with impactful, practical applications","As a professional that has been part of the sales process from a direct sales, sales management, and marketing role I found this book to be very impactful. It offers insightful and pragmatic processes and skills that can be applied by anyone associated with the sales process. Whether you are a sales manager, a technical support professional, a product manager, or the line salesperson I think that you will find some valuable information.I thought the processes regarding the successful facilitation of a ""team"" sales call to be especially interesting."
1,Obvious Information at a high price,"This book is a waste of money. All it says is what everyone already knows, one of those ""How to be a Millionaire"" books. In hundreds of pages it states research what you want to sell, go to buyer, get needs, sell solution, make money. Basic stuff, not for professionals."
4,Model Builder,"This is an old kit, dating 30+ years old. There are some fit problems and gaps when joining the fuslage to the wings. Compared to the modern manufacturers versions of the P-40, this kit still stands the test of time and can hold its own, especially for the price. You get decals for the U.S. AAF, RAF, and the Flying Tigers. I did the Flying Tigers scheme and painted the kit RAF colours, because that was where they were supposed to go before being diverted to China and the AVG. Historically, the AVG just left the aircraft in their RAF colours and applied Chinese markings. I'm sure that the aftermarket afficiandos can make this a better kit, but it a good kit out of the box and a good kit to start younger people with just entering the modeling hobby."
4,Great kit that got me back into the hobby after 25 years,"This classic kit was originally released by Monogram in the early 1960s! I'm sure after all these years that the parts have more flash and do not fit quite as well as the earlier release I built in the early 90s. But aside from a problem with where the wing meets the fuselage, and painting the canopy frames, I don't think you will have much trouble building this kit, even if it is your first build.Remarkably, even though the mold is nearly 50 years old, this is STILL the most accurate 48th scale P-40B kit on the market. If you have any questions about building this kit, my favorite forum for the hobby if building plastic airplane models is hyperscale."
5,Happy with this!,This concealer is really nice and you dont have to use a lot of it. It last all day!! Covers my dark marks easily.
1,Delayed product causes unresolved feedback to seller,"The Larenim Voodew Under Eye Concealer ordered was supposed to be 2 grams. I was patient in waiting for the order as I received emails twice requesting whether or not to maintain the order. Once received, it was only 1 gram. However, I paid and ordered a 2 gram product!"
3,Tire Cover,"Tire covere was recieved quickly, however it was hard to strech over the tire and while on vacation last week it started to come off multilpe times."
5,My three month old's favorite toy,"Although my three month old hasn't yet figured out how to make the head of this toy squeek, she has figured out that she can kick it or move it with her hands without it falling over. When we play together, I can squeek its head for her, or give it a little push to make it dance. This is the toy that we brought to the photographer's with us to make her smile."
2,Not a good value,"I am very glad a neighbor gave us this toy, as it is not the best choice for the money. Its chimes do not work easily enough for the movemnt a young child will give it, and the squeaker never gets used unless I do it. The beads are small and too low to keep any kind of attention. It is cute, but not an attention grabber for the child. Look elsewhere for the money."
3,"CUTE, BUT UNINTERESTING","I BOUGHT THIS TOY FOR MY 6 MONTH OLD BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO CUTE FOR ME TO RESIST! BUT UNFORTUNATELY, MY DAUGHTER TOOK ALMOST NO INTEREST IN IT AND NOW AT 9 MONTHS OLD ONLY OCCASIONALLY PLAYS WITH IT. SHE USUALLY JUST GIVES IT AN UNENTHUSIASTIC SWAT IN THE HEAD. ONE CHANGE THAT THEY HAVE MADE TO THIS TOY WAS TO MOVE THE SQUEAKER FROM THE HEAD TO THE TWO HOOVES. IT IS PROBABLY EASIER FOR SMALL HANDS TO SQEEZE THERE, THOUGH MY CHILD HAS NEVER TRIED IT."
5,Must have for marketers,"I was introduced to this book in a marketing class and really enjoyed it. Working in the business world, it's amazing how many people have lost track of the biggest driver of sales - the customer! This book is a great way of refocusing your mindset on your biggest assets."
2,This book is too simple and easy!,"I do not mean to use Raya Dunayevskaya as a straw-man, so to speak, but this book simply does not hit the mark. In it, the author asserts that Rosa Luxemburg was a blatant feminist. This, as anyone who has studied Luxemburg's life would know, is an absolute overstatement. It is clear that this claim was only made for the author's own end. Rosa Luxemburg cannot simply be called a feminist: She actually rejected the women's movement! Luxemburg indeed holds a place in the larger scope of feminist history, but Dunayevskaya's work is over-simplified and should not ever be used as a reputable piece of history as regards that admirable socialist leader."
5,The only source,"This is the only published source of climbing Idaho's mountains, alpine climbs, and rock climbs on peaks. This is a much revised and improved version over the first. While the book doesn't contain climbing topos or get into extreme route detail, it gives enough to get you interested, inspired, and up most peaks. My only critique would be on the Approach section- which can be a bit cumbersome to reference and the fact that it covers the whole state and can seem ""thin"" on info at times- Idaho is a huge state with so many mountains. The photographs and sketches are excellent and so is the brief history. Many mountains have more than 1 route described and the Sawtooth section is so much better than last edition. Great job and I can't wait for the next version."
2,"Climbers: Use Summitpost or call SMG or the Elephant's perch instead, don't waste your money","Tom Lopez can be commended for attempting to fit a whole state worth of mountains into one book. However, as one would expect with such bredth, it suffers greatly in depth. In many cases routes are mentioned but not described, multiple descriptions are incorrect or contain factual innacuracies rendering the description potentially dangerous (for example The Book on Finger of Fate -- no mention is made of the several 5.8 pitches that form the body of the climb in the dihedral, the only reference to 5.8 refers to the summit block, and the majority of the climb is described as a scramble!). It appears as though the author may not have climbed many of the routes described. Save your money unless you want an inventory of the names of peaks in Idaho and various thin and potentially misleading descriptions of locations and routes."
2,Disapointing !,"This book promised a lot but did not deliver.The story is complicated, the motivation of the characters is unclear. The erotic parts aren't any better.The punishment scenes are short and badly depicted. It's over before you know it and not because is was a light punishment but because the author forgot to describe it.Disapointing."
3,If you like ....,"The book delves into the life of Ellen May Roberts and for themost part her experience with her first real love Roderick. Needless to say he spanked Ellen like a child to 'improve the circulation'.. then after doing what comes nturally to normal people he of course, spanks her again ....If your into it you'll love it ... but .. Iwas hoping for at least ONE erotic scene in the 198 pages that din't require a spanking before and after ...."
5,breakfast at Milliways,"I would suggest that anyone attempting a number of impossible things early in the morning(6x7), completes the exercise with a few chapters of ""The Hitchhikers's Guide...."" before breaking bread at ""the Restaurant at the End of the Universe"""
3,Wish it fit,"This looks like such a cute toy, but unfortunately it was too big to fit around the front bar of my stroller. I think you would have to have a stroller with a very large (thick) front bar for it to work."
2,Ho Hum Hippo,"I bought this hippo hoping to distract my son (10 months) during trips to the grocery store. Silly me. He looks at it for about 15 seconds before going back to grumping about being bored. He seems slightly interested in it when riding in the car, but he usually only notices it when he can no longer reach his other toys."
3,Not too pad,"It was not too hard to put together but feels a little cheap and flimsy. Overall, I think it's not too bad for a decent looking toy chest."
4,Very pleased,"We ordered this for our sons toys and absolutely love it! We really like the color and it was easy to assemble. The hinge is set up so it won't slam shut on little fingers, it's great!"
4,Great toy box.,We bought this toy box when my daughter was first born and now at 4 it's still in great shape! It's made of quality wood and has fit into any decor we've had in her room. The only thing I would add is a locking device to keep the top up when kids are getting toys! Right now they have to hold it up themselves which can be difficult for little ones.
4,awesome,this item is very classic and classy. Very clean and crisp yet practical. An awesome addition to any room!
3,BEWARE,"I liked the design and wood color of the toy box, however it arrived with SEVERAL CHIPS AND DISCOLORATION IN IT. I like the feature so the little fingers don't slam in it but it is basically very soft plywood."
4,4 stars,"I purchased this after going over the reviews for each toy box I was interested in. The design and depth of the box are wonderful. It is not the most sturdy piece of furniture but for 100.00 bucks I did not expect a whole lot. It dents easlier I guess the wood is soft, but it holds a lot of toys!"
1,Piece of Junk!,"Do not buy this item as it is a total piece of JUNK! The build quality, materials and hardware are cheap, cheap cheap! This toy box should be priced no more than $20 at best. Run away as fast as you can..."
3,Not What I expected,I was very disappointed in this chest. I have looked everywhere for an attractive chest for my sons room & this is the only one I have seen that I like the looks of & has the latch that keeps it from smashing babies fingers. However when I received it it was busted in a couple different places & there was a place on one of the slats where it was obvious it had split in two & they had just glued it back together & shallacked over it. I feel that this chest was made with seriously poor workmanship & would not hold up well over the years. I do think the style of it is nice & would blend in well with most decors & the price was decent. For me however the bad quality outweighs all of that. I returned it with no problems & got a fast refund through amazon & guess I will continue the great toy chest search of 2010 into 2011!!:)
1,Christmas Eve nightmare,"The toy box will be beautiful, if we ever get it put together. I love that it is made in the USA, and that the wood is of good quality. Putting it together was an absolute nightmare. Two adults spent well over an hour and a half on Christmas Eve trying mightily to put it together, and we failed. So much for my daughter getting an Olivia-styled ""steamer trunk"" from Santa Claus. I changed tags on a gift I'd bought for her and made it from Santa instead. I so wanted to love this. I so do not."
3,Toy box,"This toy box is very cheaply constructed. The latch for the top is placed in a way that children will easily break off the lid. I purchased and assembled three different toy boxes with my purchase and this one was the highest price, the most difficult to assemble, and of the poorest quality. If you are purchasing for active boys I would not suggest this product."
1,Boo!,The toy box was damaged and cheap looking. It had lots of scratches on it and a few dents. We sent it back.
1,Made Cheap,"I purchased this as a toy box for my daughter. I wanted something that had some depth because she has so much stuff.For the price that I paid, this box is NOT good. It is very cheaply made. The screws stripped when trying to put it together. The wood is very soft and will dent and scratch easily but that is the least of the problems.My husband ended up having to replace the screws with some that he already had and it still didn't work.I do like the look and the depth but that's about it. For the price I would definitely recommend purchasing something better quality.We are sending it back."
2,"Cheap, dangerous","It looks nice at first and comes down slowly after assembly as it should, but the holes are not lined up properly for the safety hinge making it faulty to begin with, andafter a few uses the hinge just ripped off altogether and ruined the wood around it. Now it occasionally falls on my son and for a baby that could be very dangerous. Overall, we will need to buy a new one so it's probably cheaper to buy a quality box to begin with."
2,cute but cheap,"I generally write pretty enthusiastic reviews of things I buy on amazon but not here. The toy box is adorable, I'll grant you that. It holds a lot which is also nice. However, it is unbelievably cheaply made. The pre-drilled holes don't even remotely line up so I had to break out the drill and fix it myself. The wood is cheap and soft, scratches easily, and is poorly stained. It would be an acceptable product if it cost half the price they are selling it for but it's a rip off at the listed price."
3,"Good box, poor assembly.","The toy box itself looks nice and seems like it will be functional for its purpose. However, the actual assembly of the box very difficult. This was because the manufacturer forgot to drill the holes on the front side of the box for the crossbars. I had to go purchase drill bits and drill the holes myself. This turned what should have been a quick put-together into a huge project. Otherwise, it was mostly fine. The board in the bottom doesn't slide in or stay in easily during assembly but I don't know if that is because of an issue with the product beyond this or just from the holes I had to drill myself."
1,broken top - two times,purchased toy box for grand daughter's birthday - tried to put together today - one slat on the top has two stripped screws - means top does not cover box properly - would have it returned the except I didn't see to problem until box was put together - top is last piece attached and I ripped the box when i opened it. Can i get new top sent out ?new product sent - packaging was much better - but product top was also damaged - split slattired of putting together broken product - I want my $$ refunded and i don't want to have to pay to return damaged productdon't want any more damaged products !!have pictures I'd like to submit - not sure how to do
1,Very cheap and light weight.,Product looks amazing in pictures but when it arrived we noticed immediately how cheap and flimsy it was. In a couple months it will break where the hinges are because the screws are so small and no wood to screw into for a tight secure fit. We kept it because we did not want to bother trying to return it. The outer screws that are visible are brass(gold) and the hinges are silver and the hinge that secures it from going all the way back is some kind of antique brass which itself will break in a month or two. Don't buy.
3,Hoyle Cards 2007 Fun but buggy,"The Hoyle Card Games 2007 is a fun way to play cards. The characters that play cards with you are fun, annoying, and even fun to beat.The facemaker package, which comes with the game is supposed to allow you to design your own character but it doesn't work at all. So you are basically stuck with one character for everyone that might want to play. We even ran a repair operation on the game and it still does not work properly. I would advise you to purchase the 2008 version or contact Hoyle Games and inquire about this glitch before making a purchase. The glitch does not seem to exist in the Hoyle Casino 2007."
1,Holye Card Games,"I was very displeased with this product. When installed I was prompted to insert ""Product Key #"" which was not supplied with the CD. I contacted the distributor and was referred to someone else who in turn referred me back to the distributor. When contacting Amazon they promptly instructed me to return the product for a replacement. This I did and when the replacement arrived I had the same problem. Again I contacted to the distributor and was informed I would have an answer within 24 hours. After 3 days, with no response from the distributor, I contacted Amazon requesting authorization for return which I did. 7 Days later I received a response from the distributor stating I should unstall trial program and reinstall and not have to have a product key #. Since the CD had already be returned I could not try this."
4,This is a good way to learn a card game,"This is a good way to learn a card game. Pinochle, the various forms of poker . . . they are well explained and illustrated, in a concise and understandable manner."
3,Question?,Does this newer version include Spite & Malice and Rummy 500? I lost my 2005 disc and now have a new computer. Hoyle card games have been my favorite for years. Since I need to buy it again I'd like to know if i should get the 2007 or try to find the 2005 version. Could someone who is leaving a review for 2007 please let me know if these two games are included? Much Thanks!
2,"No bells and whistles, just plain cards","This is a great software for quickly learning games that you're not familiar with. It does NOT, however, meet the visual and audio standards of any PC game in the last 10 years at least. It has a nice feature to earn 'Hoyle Bucks' to spend on different graphics, sounds and opponents. This system does not always work, unfortunately, making the games less fun and interesting."
5,It was great.,"It arrived on time. The movie has been watched by several of us, at different times, without any glitches. No problems at all."
1,BOOTLEG!!!,If you're thinking of buying this DVD think again and save your money. It's an obvious bootleg copy of the film. The picture is so grainy you could never believe this is a Brand New DVD.
1,Paradox supreme! Guilty blame the innocent ...,"Paradox supreme indeed - Slovenes and Croats, most of whom always hated the very idea of Yugoslavia, blame the Serbs, who created the YU-state twice (in 1914-1918 and 1941-1945) and wanted to keep it together in the wars of 1990-1995, for breaking Yugoslavia up! Without similar rubbish claims and attitudes this could have been a mediocre book. This way, leave this nonsense on the shelves."
1,Should be rated with no stars,"Ah how biased is this book! I wonder how somebody can right this and claim it to be true.....Croatia was arming for war much before Milosevic came to power.Tudjman was a real war monger and a real Radical nationalist. He aimed to clean Croatia of Serbs (like Pavelic started in W.W.II)and he managed to do it in 1995, with Clinton's help.Blaiming Serbs for war is a popular sport in Croatian Nazi emigration, who escaped the justice after W.W.II....And this book is probably one of their favourites....If you want to know what happened in Yugoslavia, you should read FOOL'S CRUSADE by Diana Johnston or TO KILL A NATION by Michael Parenti. They are very objective, and they are not either Serbs or either Croats/nationalistic Slovenians (unlike the author of this sad example of a book)"
1,This didn't work for me at all,"I have never been able to breathe much at all through my nose due to congenital obstruction, so I decided to try this to help my sleep apnea and snoring. It was very uncomfortable and I never did get used to it. Moreover, it didn't work for me after weeks of trying. It's possible that because my problem wasn't simply stuffiness but the way my sinuses are shaped that the product failed to work. For others, this may not be a problem.I would, however, highly recommend the nozovent product over this one. It actually holds open the nostrils from the inside manually widening the passages and allowing more air to come in. That absolutely worked for me and is a much less expensive option as well."
5,Wonderful product!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was sceptical when I first purchased Breathe EZ, but felt it was at least worth a try. I had tried everything imaginable to help reduce my nasal congestion at nights without using decongestant tablets, which kept me awake. I tried wedge pillows, hoping to elevate my head to relieve the congestion. Nothing worked so I decided to try Breathe EZ as a last resort. I was amazed at the results! It takes a little bit of time to learn the best place to position it so that it works the best, but then it eliminates the congestion and so also helps to reduce snoring.I lost mine and am now going to purchase another one. I highly reccomend it."
5,Works for me!!,"I have used this product for a couple of years (I buy a new one periodically) and I have been very pleased with the results. I am a woman, I have never ""sawed logs"" but I did snore, and sometimes wake up from an apnea episode. As long as I am using this product, I do not have a problem breathing, and according to those who sleep within hearing distance, I do not snore either. Might not be for everyone, but I love it and do not go to sleep without it!!"
2,Good idea,"I really had high hopes for this product. I had a hard time having it even stay on mynnose & once it did, nothing happened for me."
5,Woven,"I have studied homeopathy and dreams for many years. I have read, studied, and admired Carl Jung for as long. Ms. Cicchetti weaves these 'topics' together seamlessly, providing succinct and easy to grasp commonalities and relationships. I liked this book and will read it again. I recommend it to anyone interested in any and/or all interests in the title."
2,"not ""people friendly""","This is a good idea, but difficult to use. There are plastic package openers that are more ""people friendly""."
2,poorly made,"The package opener is a bit tuff to use, and is not made very well. I was a bit disappointed. Marty"
3,Does the job - some of the time,"I saw one of these in a mall store and figured for ten bucks, it was worth a try.It works much of the time.The design is intended to protect the user from cutting their fingers on a very sharp rotary cutter. You have to open a lock to get the top and bottom halves apart. The lock is very poorly designed and is tough to open. This failing alone, frankly, is enough to justify looking for an alternative.The Pyranna will not fit over every plastic package design. And in many cases, you can only cut out a section of the plastic, not cut it entirely away, so you still have to wrestle with the packaging. The device will, however, cut the heaviest plastic I've encountered. But oddball package designs defeat it.Is it worth ten bucks? Yeah, but you might want to look at other such devices first.Jerry"
2,Sort-of works,"Those plastic packages are such a pain to open! When I saw the Pyranna I thought it was a great idea! The price is reasonable and it is well made. I bought two and gave one to my Mom. After using it for a while I have found that if the package is flat, with little to no raised lip areas, the Pyranna works like a champ. However, most of the plastic packaging has lips, raised areas and ridges which are nearly impossible to open with the Pyranna unless you apply a lot of force. I recently tried a Zibra at a friend's house and am really impressed with the way it tackled packaging without all the effort the Pyranna needed.My Mom could not operate the Pyranna because of the Arthritis in her hands. I would not recommend this product for anyone with injured or weakened hands."
2,Outdated,"I should have thought of this at the time, but I bought this book on the recommendation of a teacher who had it as a child and wanted the ""vintage"" feel of it. I intended it for my 6-year old, but as I started looking through it I realized that the answers to the questions were outdated and in a lot of respects, incorrect based on what we now know. There is a new version of this book out now (I believe by different authors)...go with that one. It won't look like it's been passed down, but at least it will have scientifically current/correct answers."
3,Ending Sucked,"This book is not recommended in my opinion. This book was a good book in the beginning to middle part but when i got to the end, the ending sucked. Usually, when a book is really good, and then the ending sucks it ruins the whole book. While i was in the middle of reading i was eager to read more and more, when i got to the last chapter i was real jumpy and could not wait for the ending to be revealed, but then the ending was not what i expected, nor would it be anyone else's."
4,Hannah in Between,I liked the book Hannah in Between. The book was very real to me . I think the book can teach other kids a lesson on what to do if a friend is doing drugs. I realy enjoyed this book!
3,Stephanies review,"I like this book because people have a lot of trouble if someone in their family has a drinking problem.It will help you figure out what you need to do,and how and where you can get help."
3,Not as good as I hoped.,"I had heard that Canadian rockers Saga were right in the league with Rush. But judging from this cd they don't even come close. I do remember the song ""on the loose"" being popular on pop radio. It is progressive rock, but very retro 1980's. More like Asia, Loverboy and Journey than Yes or Rush.Actually from listening to tracks like ""amnesia"" they sort of sound like Devo. I enjoyed the sixth track ""interview""."
4,Not what you might think '80's music sounded like!,"'80's music, which I hate, generally sounds weird and very dated, and is somewhat a genre unto itself. This one's different - genre-defying, mainstream as hell, and if you didn't know what it was, very hard to date. Somewhere between Rock and Top 40, its closest cousin is INXS.If you've heard ""On the Loose"" on the radio and liked it, this album doesn't disappoint. In fact, there are better tracks, and only a couple tolerable lemons. Extremely competent in every regard, one of the few original albums remaining in my collection."
5,classical 80's-futuristic music,"May I speak not only as a musician but as an audiophile. SAGA is one of the finest Canadian music exports besides Rush,Red Rider,Rick Derringer(aka Mahogany Rush),etc. Everything in this CD fits perfectly; strins,keyboards and percussion. You can even listen to the ligths! The chords are immaculate,even the ghost notes. You must definetely listen to this on a lazy Sunday afternoon... either crank it up or play it really low."
4,Great band...,"I must confess I've never heard SAGA before. I purchased this CD soon after buying Detours -Live- . They sounded great on stage, so I decided to try them at the studio. Guided by another Amazon reviews, I chose Worlds Apart. Great sound, great band. Nice musical arrangements, beautiful guitar riffs -at times resembling Marillion's Steve Rothery- and well balanced vocals.Summing up, I can say this is an album to consider from a band to pay good attention to."
3,One of 1982's most memorable tracks,"One of my favorite songs from 1982 is Saga's ""On the Loose."" More than liking the song itself, I like the feeling in rekindles from that period of time. The song was everywhere in `82; you rarely hear it now, though. I don't remember a video for ""On the Loose,"" but the song, for some reason, always makes me think of early MTV, which in turn brings to mind Taxxi's ""Cocktail Queen (Don't She Love to Rock `n Roll)"" and Toronto's ""Your Daddy Don't Know,"" two songs (and videos) also worth checking out!"
4,Thier best selling cd ever,This was Saga's big splash. Here it is remastered. It has the two songs played most on the USA radio on it On the Loose and Wind Him Up. The track order is slightly different from the other version I have of it. Time's Up is in the second slot insteade of Wind Him Up. The remastering allows it to be cranked a little louder than previous versions. The weakest song on it is Amensia but it still is a pretty good song. All in an excellent effort. The video for Wind Him Up was shot live in Montreal in 1984. I still think Silent Knight is their best cd.
3,Nature of the Beast,"A made for t.v. comedy, I missed this when it first came out. Anyways that, if you watched the show Ugly Betty, you'll recognize the villian as having played a part in it.As a romance-comedy where the guy is seeking to lift his curse of werewolfism and his bride-to-be is helping him lift it. It wasn't bad. Many of the actors did very well, there's only one, the guy who played the news report that was just bad acting all around and terrible, over the top and trying to outdo the stars and proper co-star.Overall the movie has me wanting to compare it with Teenwolf, also done as a comedy, somewhate and for quality.Also being something of an amatuer werewolf expert, I surprised with how much they drew from an almost obsure source with their werewolf lore for the movie."
1,"For God's Sake, Don't Buy This Cookbook!","When I first thumbed through this cookbook, my immediate thought was that some dreadful mistake had been made, and that I'd been sent the wrong cookbook. After all, the recipes (largely unfamiliar to Hungarians, but that's another story) were generally followed by only one paragraph of text. In fact, what I've written up to this point was about all the information the author provided the reader in making each dish.Well... ghastly, awful, a joke... all three of these terms would fairly and accurately descibe this so-called cookbook. But then it dawned on me, surely this is one of those vanity press jobs. And taken in that light, I think Amazon really ought to point out that fact to would-be buyers ahead of time. So please don't get fooled like I was. Repacking it and returning it to Amazon was certainly no pleasure."
1,from a Hungarian mom,"First of all, Hungarian food and kosher just won't match!!! What a joke! Then, I have no idea where these recipes came from... not from a Hungarian's kitchen, for sure.Instead of this, I'd recommend ""Magdi's Quick and Easy Hungarian and Gourmet Recipes"" for great tasting real Hungarian food, with detailed step-by-step pictures and explanations."
4,comfortable,"I like this shoe because of its comfort. It looks a little school matronish though. Since I work in one, I guess it will pass. The heel is great and a good shoe for slacks on those not so dressy days where you want to show up looking neat."
3,Ok but not great.,"I ordered this unit so I could hook up my DVD to the TV without having to change the input signal each time. There seems to be a little static on the lines, not quite as clear a picture as I would like, but does do the job."
4,converter,Works great especially for the price I paid for it.I just wished that I didn't need a converter just to watch movies.
4,converter,Have an older tv and wanted to hook up a dvd player to it. Purchased this converter so I can watch movies on my tv. Works well and was easy to hook up.
1,Very poor customer care,The 3 packs of cocoa I had ordered were packed so sloppy that one of the cocoa packs broke during transit. Needless to say the mess it created in my kitchen when I opened the box. I sent American Spice 2 emails and complained about the broken package. Obviously American Spice does not have time for their customers; they never bothered to acknowledge receipt of my emails. This was my first and my last time doing business with American Spice.
1,Why can you not tell us what is in the box?,"Is this like a ""grab bag"" of WWII footage, or are you afraid to tell us what is inside the box? I'm guessing that it's a one-star deal!"
1,HATED IT,"I would give it a big fat ZERO but they won't let you go that low. I pumped for almost an hour and got less than a ounce of milk. I have the Medela Harmony, which uses a vacuum type motion to express milk (I am usually done pumping in 15 minutes and get 5 ounces) and thought the massaging would work better and this looked very comfortable. I was wrong. I called the 1800 number and they gave me all these things to do to see if it would work better, it didn't. I called back two days later and I am getting a refund. As a mom of a seven month if I had hours of free time I wouldn't spend it pumping milk. PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!"
1,Poor quality,Why do stores continue to sell such terrible pumps such as this and Evenflo? Anyone who does any research knows pumps such as these have numerous complaints logged- even with the FDA because they cause nipple damage and can interfere with a mom making enough milk for her baby. &amp;#60;br /&amp;#62;<br />At least Target also sells a couple of good manual pumps such as the Medela Harmony and the Avent Isis but I wish stores would pay attention to the FDA complaints and not just look at the Nelson marking index when they make their decisions.
2,requires time and patience,"I bought this pump after a part on my electric pump needed to be replaced. I actually enjoyed a cord and noise free pumping experience, but this pump was simply not effective in my opinion. This pump would be great for a mom relaxing at home, who has plenty of time and only occasionally needs to express milk. I am a working mom, and feel that this certainly could not be depended upon as an effective way to express enough milk for a baby. An hour pumping for 3 oz of milk per breast, I simply do not have that kind of time, comfort or not! I was very disappointed especially since it is quite pricey for a hand held pump! I'd love to see a more comfortable product but it must also be effective!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!,"I tried to use this breast pump multiple times with my first child and had no success. I pumped for almost an hour the first time and was only able to get a few drops out. The pump doesn't have the proper suction it needs, and I think it is definitely a problem if you are a little bigger up top. Needless to say this went in the trash and I would never recommend it to anyone! What a huge disappointment from Gerber!"
1,tricky,"This was so tricky to use. Sometimes I could get it to work and sometimes I'd have to fiddle with it for ten minutes. Even when it worked, it wasn't nearly as effective as other manual pumps I've tried. It was fairly comfortable, though, I'll give it that."
3,Works Well but Store Inside to Improve Durability,The net was set up outside and not brought indoors when not in use. It performed very well when new but after the 1st year some parts of the net tore. After a second year of use it is due for replacement.
3,"Does what it's supposed to do, but there is a better option","There really isn't too much to say about the cradle. Drop in the Palm, hit the button and it syncs. However, save yourself a few dollars and buy the serial cable instead. It is cheaper, more portable, and most importantly for me, easier to plug into my Palm because I keep it secured in a carrying case."
1,Haven't rec'd the product,I still have not rec'd the cradle I ordered and paid for. Can you help? I would rate it no stars but itwouldn't allow me to do it.Linda Baker
4,Good product but obsolete,"I have a couple of these. It makes it easy to sync between multiple computers.Unfortunately, I now need to upgrade my conduit software to get it to work with MS Office 2003. The cost of the software is more than I paid for my last PALM III. I'm not one to pay for something twice, so I'll be tossing this PDA out or giving it away.If you are thinking about getting one of these, my advice is don't unless you are running legacy software and plan not to upgrade."
2,Wasn't exactly what I ordered,Ordered a Palm III & VII HotSync Cradle but I got in the mail a Palm m100 HotSync Cradle instead. Wasn't what I expected.
4,Love this one :),"This book is a bit longer than many picture books, and the illustrations aren't as colorful as in more modern books, so some smaller children may have trouble sitting through it. However, with the right age range, this book is wonderful.A little boy is just randomly invited to the palace for the tea (every day in a week, in fact). So each time he brings a guest, another animal, until Saturday when he turns the tables and they all go to the zoo to eat their tea instead.It's sweet, it's simple, it has a gentle rhyme, my nieces love it - I love it! You definitely want to check this one out."
1,May I Bring a Friend?,"May I Bring a Friend? is another fun sequential story for children to enjoy. This one is all about any child's favorite thing--animals! It combines aspects of a fairytale fantasy world with a regular child's world, sure to delight young children Kids will definitely relate to the young child and his menagerie of friends. They'll find it funny and learn their days of the week at the same time. I'm not really a fan of the illustrations at all. I know the book won a Caldecott, but the images are extremely dull and blurred, hard to make out what is even being depicted. Not all that great."
2,A sweet novel but is a bit repetitive,"This book is wonderful for small children who are just learning to read. Probably considered a ""bedtime book"""
5,We love these books,"After finding Three Stories You Can Read to Your Cat at our local library and realizing that it was going to be hard to remove it from the house to return it, I went out and found all 4 books (3 Stories You Can Read to Your Cat, 3 More Stories You can Read to Your Cat, 3 Stories You Can Read to Your Dog, and 3 More Stories You Can Read to Your Dog.)My kids are 3.5 and love these stories.. They very quickly memorized their favorites and apply the situations in the stories to our cats and dogs freely ( I think Auggie wants to be a Wild Dog today!). Written in a great voice that grabs your kid's attention and which is easily understood to be speaking not to them but to your cat or dog. The kids love the idea. The stories are genuinely funny."
4,Pretty awesome book,I got this book for my girlfriend to read to our cat.I've ended up reading it to her in bed while the cat did his own thing.I just wish the book was longer.
4,Granddaughter loved it.,Gave this as a Christmas present to my 7 year old granddaughter and she loved it. Although at last contact she had yet to share with her cat. Guess she wanted to get the stories straight before sharing!
5,"Fun, cute, and true","My 5 year old daughter loves for us to read this book to her, over and over again. I like it too, the storyline and the artwork. The pictures of the cat eating the bug make us both laugh our buns off every time. I'm buying a few more to give as gifts to friends."
4,Three stories to horrify you.,"John Carpenter (the master ofHalloween[1978]) who plays a coroner tells you a new story. A woman starts her first night as a gas station cashier. She is all alone. One customer she meets is David Naughton (American Werewolf in London Special Edition) whose character was born in Haddonfield (Yes, the one in HALLOWEEN) where this story is set. Later a homeless man asks for the key to the bathroom. But the woman mistakenly forgot the key inside her booth. More suspense. Later she finds the homeless man murdered. More suspense. There is a killer at the gas station. She thought she was alone. But that's not all. John Carpenter will have two more stories to show you. The second story stars Stacy keach and Sheena Easton. Keach is a middle-aged man who is upset that he is going bald, just has thin hair. He tries everything with no success. Then he goes to a professional hair company. The third story stars Mark Hamill and Twiggy."
4,A triple fear factor,"This was, in my opinion, a scary movie. I saw it once on Halloween, and even though it could have been better, I liked it. I guess partly because Mark Hamill is in it and he did a good job. A must for all John Carpentar fans."
2,A Gorier Version of Tales from the Crypt,John Carpenter teems with Tobe Hooper to deliver their version of Tales from the Crypt. This film consist of three short episode which are silly and anything but scary. Only positive side is a half decent and amusing performance from John Carpenter as a deceased coroner.
3,A stupid horror movie,"This movie is not a horror, it's a part comedy and the story is so low that you sit and laugh rather than be scared. The actors are great, but it's one of the worst movies Carpenter has ever made."
1,Don't waste your time with the DVD version,Some scenes have been cut. The Laserdisc version is better.
3,"Not so good, not so bad....","This work makes me disappointed contrary to my expectation. I like John Carpenter's movies, which are horror style, such as ""the fog"", ""village of the damned"" and ""prince of darkness"". I expected the movie that will be interesting, but it was nothing like a general horror movie. To tell the truth, this film is ill matched to John Carpenter. However, one thing makes me interesting. I saw many famous horror directors in this film, such as ""Sam Raimi"", ""Wes Craven"", ""Tobe Hooper"", ""Roger Corman"" and ""John Carpenter"". This film is divided into 3 parts. John made two parts and Tobe made the other one. In my opinion, the third one that Tobe made, it was better than others were. Anyway, John makes me always exciting when I watch his films."
2,Laughibly Terrible,"This movie makes perfect sense to me now.....It should be titled ""Director runs out of original ideas and writes a few stories that could have turned into full length movies if he had been able to carry the plot further, but ultimately fumbled and then gave all 3 short stories stupid, pointless endings, so he could still put them on a video and make a few bucks off of his work."""
5,Well Worth Reading,"I found the novel HEROES OR SOMETHING highly readable and consistently entertaining. It gives a first-hand sense of what life and death must have been like for American soldiers in Vietnam. It also supplies a gritty view of life for at least some Vietnamese peasants during the war. Its fictional story-line involves situations that illustrate some of the pitfalls of American strategic policy at that time. At the same time, it clearly pays tribute to the sacrifices of the American soldiers there and the goals they championed. Perhaps there can be no higher praise for a book of this sort."
2,Disappointed,"I was not impressed with the quality of this toy. The cars and the cab of the tractor trailer have lasted just fine, but after only a few weeks the doors of the trailer would no longer stay latched. We ended up throwing away the trailer and my son just plays with the cab of the truck. So we still have cars spread all over his room."
2,Waste Of Money!!,"I consider myself to be somewhat educated in ways of auto repair, and i gotta say this manual is way to generalized for nearly anyone to get unique information from it. Half the time you need to flip from one chapter to the next to get the full message on how to actually get the job done. The engine section seems to be well detailed in comparison to the rest of the book, but i have never needed to use that section."
1,A BAD BOOK,"Not recommendable, 90% feedback goes for all cars, not half as good as the Mazda MX-5 Miata 1.6: Enthusiast Workshop Manual, which I purchased together with this one.This one has a wiring plan though, which I find lacking in the Mazda MX-5 Miata 1.6: Enthusiast Workshop Manual."
5,Got it... newer than expected!,"The ad said the book was used. Came new in the plastic, but looked like New old stock. Great guide, a must have for any car you own."
1,Waste of paper and ink,"When information is needed in the more technical areas,this manual says to take the car in to a professional for the repair. Now why would a person need a repair manual put together by someone that feels the person reading it isn't able to preform the task at hand?I surely do not need a manual to tell me I need to ""take"" my car to a professional for repairs.If I wanted to pay someone to repair my car I sure as heck wouldn't buy a how to repair manual that states it covers all areas of repair.This manual leaves a lot of questions unanswered in the repair of the Miata. Over all IMO... it is a very poor manual that gives the feeling the writers really didn't have much experience in repairs of this model vehicle."
5,Comfortable leather watchband.,"This leather watchband is of first grade leather, with fine stitching, and shapes itself after your wrist fast, for a comfortable fit, very nice quality and finish, and will upgrade your watch, and give it a classsy elegant look too, much recommended.Milano Watchbands enclose springpins with the watchband."
2,Book for SAP Version 4.0; needs updating,"Bought the book in March 2002 and much to my surprise, this book deals with R/3 Version 4.0. Given the CATT tool and workbench went through a major overhaul in versions 4.5 and 4.6 (including the addition of a new, simplified transaction), this should be recognized. If your buying this for the tool, be aware."
3,Showing its age,This was probably a great book back in 2000 when it was published but it is showing its age. SAP has moved on and this book would be good if it did too.
4,Buy it Now!,"This audio tape gets done in one short cassette what you've been trying to do all your life. The format is a bit hoaky, but fun and easy to listen to. Bliss offers real-life ideas and examples that anyone can use. Even if you've read all the self-help books or if you're a non-believer, this tape will motivate you to get things done. Give it a listen."
1,First Audio Book I ever returned of 100s,"I collect audio books, esp non-fiction, self-improvement, sales, history, etc. This book was so bad, I could not even keep it for trading. I would not want anyone to own a copy. It sounds like simple nagging. Get Brian Tracy or any of a dozen other books. Please do not spend a dime on this one. I currently own about 200 audio books, and this is the first I ever tood back to the store."
2,Old hot sauce,"This sauce seemed to be very old a dried out on top. Has a hot habanero taste. Not my favorite, but that is just my taste."
2,Not worth buying free,"There seems to be problems with transcribing some parts of books such as this. Throughout, the major turning points of the stories, which are quotes from either letters or newspaper articles, are completely missing. I am guessing that the missing sections appear in italics or some variant form.This not the only book in which I have seen this -- makes the entire thing useless. The whole development of the story involves newspaper ads -- all of which are missing."
3,Twain got me,"I have to admit, this story really captivated my attention. There was a lot of chaos and ""secrecy"" going on but in the end, he got me."
2,Energizer ER-P730 Nickel-Metal Hydride Cordless Phone Battery,"as advertised. fit perfectly , works great"
1,EXPIRED IN 2007?,"The reviews for this product on other sites are quite good...I must say I cancelled my order here when I read the product description and saw that the expiry date was 2007..holy smokers, it's July 2010!"
3,"Comfy shoe, but a little big. It'll pull your socks down","This is my first pair of ECCO golf shoes. They're a bit large, but very comfortable. Unfortunately, the inside heel is lined with some type of suede-like material that grabs at the back heel of my sock. The more I walk (especially uphill) the more my socks get pulled down off my heel. Very frustrating to have to pull up my ankle socks at every hole!Pretty disappointed. They're great if you're not walking in them... like at the range."
5,Best Cd iv listened to in a long time,"finaly i can get a cd that i can listen the whole way through and not skip songs, i love every song on this cd. I would recommend you buying it, i listen to this cd probly everyday. The kid things for 13 year-olds but im 15. and i dont have an account here."
2,"A ""change"" of pace? Hardly","ACOP's second full length offering ""prepare the masses"" is anything but a ""change"" from the corporate faux post-hardcore trash we're subjected to on a daily basis by taking back sunday and so they say. If you're expecting something catchy, you'll be letdown. If you're expecting something heavy, you'll be letdown. If you're expecting something original...forget about it!Aside from a small handful of radio singles, there is almost nothing memorable about ""prepare the masses"". It is what it is; generic post-hardcore. If you're a diehard fan of 'so they say' or 'taking back sunday' (post-tell all your friends), you may want to give this a shot. Anyone else, stay away!"
5,"Brilliant, provocative examination of our judicial system.",Absolutely stunning film which stayed with me for weeks. Every five minutes I found myself convinced alternately of the guilt and innocence of the accused. The filmmakers definitely have their beliefs but don't shove them down the viewer's throat. The consequent developments in the story are even more fascinating -- check out their web site AFTER you watch the film. END
5,Thought-provoking,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Eventhough it's a documentary, you relate to the people involved and see how American justice spins it's wheels. All I can say is WOW! END"
4,Get it for the Human Club Mix!,"I've had the U.S. maxi cd of Human Nature for about 4 years now, but I just received this U.K. version in the mail today (which I got from the Amazon marketplace) and I have to say that the Human Club mix on this cd (which is NOT on the U.S. single) is the BEST remix of Human Nature I ever heard! It's actually the full lenght version of the so-called ""radio edit"" which IS on the U.S. version, but here you get the full 9 minutes of it. I previously didn't really like the radio edit, but now after hearing the full lenght version, i LOVE this mix! Get it!"
2,The US maxi has lot more to offer...,"Don't be fooled : the ""Chorus Door Slam with Nine Sample"" is actually the ""Howie Tee Remix"" found on the US Maxi.Buy this pretty expensive import only if you're dying to have the full-lenght version of the ""radio edit"" (human club mix) in your collection, but you'll get much more mixes on the US maxi (9 tracks)."
3,The DT Club Mix is the best.,"This release has the full Club Mix by Danny Tenaglia which is not on the US. While there is a DT short version and a different DT mix on the USA release, the short version is... well... short. WTF do you put a short version on a Maxi? At least put the long version as well! The other DT remix on the USA is missing the bassline.The other versions are fine, fusing a bit of hip-hop into the foray."
3,"Good, but watch out!","This book is nearly identical, text-wise, to ""The Essential Pug"". These are both good, but about half of the info is generic for any breed. I'd recommend ""The Essential Pug"" (which, interestingly enough, has no author listed). It's several dollars cheaper and the pictures are much better."
4,Good - but not great.,"This is a good book about pugs but here is the breakdown of the book. It has 158 pages total, 93 pages apply to pugs but the rest are generic for any dog. The book covers ancestry of the pug, behavior, where to get a pug, dealing with a new pug puppy/adult, feeding, grooming (coat, nose, ears, eyes and mouth) nails, general disease prevention, safety and exercise. The best part of the book is the grooming section though I would have to say that most of the other sections cover pugs rather marginally. I have found much more detailed information on web sites. I would say it is a great book for someone who is considering a pug as a pet and wants to know their history and general information, but for a new owner, I'd choose a more detailed guide to care for your pug."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book has many topics, but barely touches on each one, only giving you a few lines for each topic. Definately not enough to get any kind of useful information from.Extremely disappointed with this book."
5,This book has practical advise to offer a new pug owner.,This is a wonderful book that is full of useful information for new pug owners. It gives specific advise on preparing for your new puppy. It covers everything from supplies you will need to grooming tips. It even includes a section on basic training.
4,great game,"I bought this game for my 3rd grader because I wanted her to have extra practice with her school work. This is just that, a game. Spectrum, Scholastic and Spectrum have some great work books if your looking for real practice. I also recommend the Take It To Your Seat centers."
3,Just OK,I must say this product is OK. There is way too much story line that you must hear over and over. I just wish they would get to the educational games already. While there is so much story line there are very few instructions and some of the games are very hard to understand. So just an OK rating from me.
1,Can't play- freezes computer,"We ordered both 4-6th grade Jumpstart and this Jumpstart Advanced 3rd grade. The 4-6th grade works great, but this one (3rd grade advanced) freezes up two computers used for games. Both have Windows versions listed as compatible. Sending back."
5,Fun and Educational,My kids love the games and don't even realize they are learning/ reviewing the fundamentals. I highly recommend it.
4,Excellent,"This is a great buy for my second grader daughter. She is enjoying every bit of it. She is learning good through this one. It teaches speed, skills and ability to complete."
2,Internship Assesement,"This book appears as if it would be particularly applicable for addressing the crucial personal issues, attitude, and resolve that are often neglected in the formula of considering how to maximize professional gains/personal satisfaction in an internship. The main issue that limits the book's scope and relevance is that it was written specifically for people in the social work field, limiting the usefulness of the author's message. With that said, the book is cheap and can be skimmed in about an hour, offering 20 pages of solid advice."
5,B Mans BBQ Sauce,"The best sauce ever! We discovered it on a closeout sale. Hard to find. All natural ingredients, no cane, fructose or corn syrup. It is our favorite BBQ sauce ever! On everything. All meats, we especially love it on chicken thighs, on the grill. Veggies and home-fries. And meatballs, yum! Please carry it on Amazon!"
5,Finally a great sauce!,"Wow! Being from Texas I have longed for a wonderful tasting BBQ sauce. If you are looking for flavor with a smooth and spicy kick, you picked the right sauce.Great job B-man!"
4,"S.C. Hughes, Camden, NJ","First Male Born is a compelling depiction of an Italian family making its mark in America. The characters and their struggles are real, not romanticized or glamorized as is often found in books of this kind. Mr. Vincenzo is also a good storyteller. A good read."
3,I ordered the wrong part. Correct part not available.,I ordered the wrong AC adapter. The AC adapter for my flash unit is no longer available. The unit has been returned.
2,Way too big,"I ordered a medium because I had planned to use this tank during workouts and wanted a bit of room. Unfortunately the medium is more like an XL and because it's so big it gives off a ""boxy"" look. I am a bit disappointed."
4,'Heavyweight'? Hmmm?...,"These are nice little tank tops overall, though a 'large' in this style of Anvil tank tops runs MUCH larger than a large in their Anvil Ladies 2x1 Rib Tank w/Constrast Stitch. I was going to return these for a medium since it appears as if a medium would fit me nicely and the cut is cool and flattering, but decided to keep the large ones I purchased and just use them as sleep shirts - it's too much of a hassle to return them, and shipping and return shipping costs would not be refunded anyway.I'm a little disappointed in the thickness of the fabric of this 'heavyweight' though - not very thick at all, and a bra would likely be a necessity with some of the lighter colors. I'm not a bra person and have no intention of becoming one anytime soon, nor will wearing a tank top I adore ever convert me, so...? I like the length of these tank tops though, hip-length, nice selection of colors too, so I guess these are pretty nice overall."
3,"Fit's ok, not heavyweight.","I'm picky when it comes to tanks. Fit is priority and this fits well. Not too tight and the armholes are sufficient without forcing a wardrobe malfunction. That's the good.It's a bit odd that they call it ""heavyweight"". If this is heavyweight, the lightweight tank must be saran wrap because this is the thinnest shirt I own, including a 15 year old tee that I wear all the time. This tank is a bit revealing but that just may be the color I bought (yellow). Overall, it's ok though. I'd buy another in a darker color, mainly because of the fit. I do wish it were a little thicker material, not just for coverage but because I'd like it to last longer."
2,Too technical for me,Obvioously I am not ready for this level of workings in my life. Guess for someone who is it will be okay
3,reflections,"I adore the voice of Mr. Phipps but this dvd lacked the ""presence"" of the depth of slave songs. It seemed like the Shirley Temple version of slavery - light hearted,void of the heart-wrenching pain which is poured out in slave songs. The cruelty, the selling of parents away from their children, the mutilations, the lynchings.This needed the genius of maestro Allen Foster & Frank B. Mitchell of the Philadelphia Opera Co. to recreate the spirit of the slave who have a more creative license than Mr. Phipps does with the Grahams."
3,a throw-away read for me,"Not that throw-aways reads have no value! Sometimes we all need mindless fun. It's just I don't think this tome will give me much use as a reference work. It's a one-time skim-thru for me, and will find it's way to book fair sales drum sooner than most. It's just the nature of the beast."
4,Girls will like this too!,I suppose men will think this book is just for them. But it will also appeal to those of us who like wearing stockings and lingerie. It will give us some ideas of how to do it!
3,Dry,"This is a review of the free Kindle edition. To get it out of the way, this is NOT about Jutland. This is Jellicoe's writing about the submarine problem in 1917 and 1918. It's interesting how he didn't buy into the convoy system, as he was more worried about mines. Remarkable to me.The writing style is very dry, as you might expect. The highlight is the stories of the decoy ships. Amazing acts of bravery by the crews.Also interesting is how little Jellicoe thought of the German sub crews. He states that England would have been taken down in a month or two if they had been facing English sailors in the subs.3,707 locations."
2,"Great book, poor movie.","Great novel by Ed McBain, poorly made into a movie.But a nice collector's item.Should have subtitles.'Schlang' is hard to understand if only spoken....James Franciscus is to cute to be......Spoiler!!!!!"
1,Quickly Outdated,"I was hoping that there would be some long-lasting information in this book that might have applicability to today's software development environments. Alas, even though the copyright is 1995, most of the references to the literature (journal articles and other books) are hardly later than 1986. This means that the book uses information that's almost 20 years old (and in many cases older than that).I was hoping for a Peopleware-like book for software engineering departments, but I will have to keep looking."
1,Caution - not compatible with RC 930 wireless modem system,I wanted to add an additional extension to my RC 930 wireless modem. This was the only RCA extension unit that I could find so I ordered it. I now know that the RCA wireless phone and modem systems are not compatible. RCA confirmed this over the phone and also said that the modem extensions are not sold separately.
3,Works great but...,this little gizmo works fine for most phones but it DOES NOT work with phones with caller ID. Keep that in mind when you're considering a purchase. Works great with the others. Overall a nifty little device.
2,Don't be misled.,"It was only when I purchased and received this unit that I understood how it worked and that ""phone jack extension"" meant it was a receiving unit dependent on a transmitting unit which plugs into an existing phone jack. I was naive in thinking it could be a standalone marvel of advanced circuitry and technology. Shoulda' read the fine print but I don't believe it's explained in the promotional copy that it's part of a two-box ""system.""Buyer beware. But I must add that my trust in shopping at Amazon was increased by the no-questions-asked return policy which was so efficiently and swiftly applied. No deceptions there!"
4,telephone jack,when i bought this i guess i didn't read everything i needed another so i had to buy the grounder i guess. but they work great. for a phone i needed on my porch. i didn't want another line put in my house.
2,Customer service,"I thought I ordered both receiver and transmitter, had to re-order by phone. They told me they would send me a R.A. by email and I never got it now I'm stuck with two orders."
1,RC920 Wireless phone jack system.,"This system did not work for me. When I answer the phone it works for about a minute and then shuts off. The indicator lights on the base and extension are still on steady indicating the system is still on but no sound comes through. With the line still open, momentarily hanging up and picking up again restores operation but then it shuts down again in about ten seconds. I called their help hotline and after performing all their automated corrections with no results I got a live person. He didn't seem to know anything other than to send it to their repair station. But when two brand new units fail in exactly the same manner, it isn't a matter of repair."
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT,"I bought this product to connect my Directv line. There is 25ft. between sender and receiver. All I get on my phone is static. I have tried SEVERAL locations in the room. I have tried to contact RCA (Thomson Inc.)all you get is a recording, you can't get a live person. You can't even talk to a technical support.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!"
5,Very good introduction to different schools of thoughts,"I am an MA in applied linguistics student at University of Massachusetts, Boston. I have to read H. Douglas Brown's Principles of Language Learning and Teaching. I have never taken courses in introduction to psychology and educational psychology, and I don't understand the different schools of thoughts just by reading H. Douglas Brown's book. After reading this book Psychology for Language Teachers, I fully understand their differences. Thank you Marion Williams and Robert Burden for writing this book."
5,Easy to read,This is an easy book to read. You can jump from chapter to chapter like reading individual stories. Find points of interest without having to read chapters in order. Good book.
5,Canon PowerShot SD900 Titanium 10MP Digital Elph Camera review,"Very enhanced features. Good use of high-tech. Enabled rotation for video images. Sharp images. Excellent camera, very recommended."
4,Something to remember,"Really good video with all the important interviews and races. I was expecting to see something new, never seen before, but there is really nothing exclusive. Anyway, it is good to have for something that is so worthy to remember."
3,"The ""Inside Story"" of Michael Phelps at 2008 Olympics","Great to be able to watch all of the amazing final races on one disc. But the DVD was VERY incomplete in that it could and SHOULD have been much, much more as the ""Inside Story of the Beijing Games."" None of the qualifying races were shown and there were no expected extras like the interplay between Michael and Coach Bowman and Michael and the other swimmers, footage from Michael at the Olympic village and from around Beijing, footage of Michael's warm-ups for the races and getting massages between races etc."
3,Poor picture quality,"It's great to have all of the races on one DVD, but the picture quality is that of a VHS (remember those?)."
1,bad replacement,I bouht this battery and used it for 2 months and it doesn't work any more. It lasted a very short time!!!
2,Short Life Span,"I purchased 2 of these for my V-Tech cordless phones. One stopped holding a charge after 3 months and the other after 5 months. I decided that this must be a sign to replace my cordless phone system. So I purchased the Panasonic KX-TG6513B DECT 6.0 PLUS Expandable Cordless Phone System, Black, 3 Handsets. And by the way, these phones use standard NiMH AAA rechargeable batteries."
4,little early to review,"so far so good , the batteries came quickly, they work well I can not comment on longevity yet as its only been a month or so"
1,Short Life,After 6 months these would not hold a charge for a day. After 18 months they are dead coming off the charger.
1,Wouldn't hold a charge/Doesn't fit,"I bought this battery based on the well known brand it was, but was surprised that it would not charge. This battery is supposed to be an exact replacement for my VTECH the cordless phone battery 80-5017-00-00 but it did not ""snap"" into the battery compartment like the original did, it was loose. I returned it for a refund."
1,Poor replacement,I thought an Energizer would be a good replacement for my cordless phone. Unfortunately (for me) this battery loses its charge after just a few calls off of its base station. I've only had this battery for a month. The original battery lasted for many years. Bummer.
1,BAD BATTERY,"After one year of service (lightly used phone) this battery will not take a charge. I have insured the contacts are clean and the charger is functionly properly.I have found a Sanyo on Ebay which is much better and less expensive.I would not waste your time or money on this ""Energizer"""
1,Worked until after the 90 warranty was up,This fax machine was a dream compared to our ten-year old machine we had been using in my office. That is until it just stopped working and we sent it to a Sharp Service center for repair. I was told that the cluth on the paper feed was broken(through no fault of our own)and that the repairs would cost 130.00. Fifty dollars more than we paid for it. We had this for 8 months and the warranty runs out after 90 days. How convenient.
1,This is a piece of junk,The automatic feed stops working after about 3 months. How do you feel about re-dialing for each page you send?
1,Get a fax modem instead,"Generally, this fax machine is poor. Also, it is an ""ink hog"". I've finally decided to stop using this machine, as it is always out of ink. I get lots of junk faxes, which deplete ink for no reason. Carts can be refilled, but quality is poor. For the price of the machine, you can get a USRobotics USB fax modem, The software with this package (BVR) works great. You can preview your faxes, and decide not to print. Thats what I'm using now!"
2,unhappy,"Did not work out of box, help line could not get it to work. Had to drive almost an hour to get it serviced and lucky enough to have the teck work on it right then. Half an hour later it was working [a gear was out of place and paper would not feed]."
1,I paid for 2 but only got 1,"The product description was misleading, it indicated a set of tail lights when in fact it only contained 1 side!"
3,Iffy....,"This book came up as an price cut when I was buying another book. I read the reviews and it sounded great, I've always had a problem deciding what punctuation marks go where and when, etc. But honestly, I haven't been able to get past the first section of the first chapter - commas. I tried going a little further in the chapter beyond commas, and still no interest. IDK, maybe I'll use it more in the future, and for the price, it's a good tool to have on hand if you need it. But at the same time, I probably could look it up on bing. The description of it made it sound like it had to just deal with ""legal writing"" but so far I've just seen ""plain english""."
2,slippery in the hand,"The finish is slippery in the hand, and the clip broke off in short order. I am happier with a $10 Parker pen from Staples."
3,What's wrong here?,I will not dispute that the author is talented at writing. But the reader should be aware that Sam Teague is a notorious serial child molester serving his second sentence in a Louisiana prison for said offenses. There is something wrong with a sexual predator who targets children writing and selling books also targeted at the same juvenile audience.
2,"Great name, however Chinese product.",I ordered a set of eye bolts to use as harness anchors on my metal house roof. This eyebolt has the name (Koch)with a 2200 pound safety rating on the tag attached to the bolt. This product is ROUGH! The bolt is VERY rough and the threads do not inspire confidence at all. These bolt items should be portrayed as an imported product in the description. The bolt tag also states that human weight should not be supported by this bolt....with a 2200 pound safety rating? Is this lawyerspeak or a real reference to the item quality? I am really disapointed.
1,Book without CD,I got this book for the reason that it has the software accompanying it that I can use to understand things better. But when the book arrived it came without the CD. Hence no use for me.
4,Survival of the Fittest!,"The Aliens Predator Card Game is one of the best CCG's out. Now they have an expansion set inspired by the movie Aliens: Resurrection. Produced by HarperCollins, this game pits three deadly species against each other: Humans (Marines), Predators, and Aliens in an all out battle for dominance. This set is completely compatible with the first series. If you're an avid fan of the ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" movies, this set is for you! The only drawback is finding other players to go against. I recommend checking your nearest comic book store to see if they hold any CCG games in their store. The price of the set is worth it, because you get all the cards in the set. Trying to find these cards in individual booster packs will only cost more in the end. You will not be sorry about this buy!"
4,Better for newbies than the old-timers,"The Vampire RPG is relaunched in this book. Someone who has been playing Vampire for a long time would probably enjoy this book, but will lose a lot of what they alredy have invested in the system, as there are only 5 clans and 2 are new. One, the Daeva, a vampire who specializes in passion and sexiness, has already making a name for itself at its GEN CON release.If you have never been particular fond of Vampire before, this will be the book to draw you in, if ever. This is a more focused Vampire game and many of the things non-Vampire players disliked about the game are gone, such as too many clans and how elders can just boss people around. Vampire is now worth a second-look."
5,The BEST roleplaying game Ive played,"Im new to this game and I think this game is the best one out there. Unlike Dungeons and Dragons this game offers more potential for roleplaying and is more mature in nature. You do need to buy the World of Darkness along with this book in order to play, but that is still cheaper than buying a Players Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide and Monster Manual in order to play D&D.;Plus this game allows alot more flexibility if you want to play with Werewolves, Mages and other supernatural creatures. It gives you the freedom to create almost any character concept from lord of the night to shapeshifting vampires.This game is absolutely amazing and I plan on buying the other supplements for it."
2,"Good idea, bad execution.","I'v been playing Vampire and other RPGs on and off for 20 years.Like so many other RPGs, Requiem(v3) is a major step backwards from Masqarade(v4)Dumb it down to the point where you have an RPG that has about as much thought behind it as the ""plot"" line form Grand Theft Auto 3.On the good side, they did lessen the Jyhad but kept the awful ""Traditions of Caine"" (yes, we removed them)And it STILL has the genenerally awful cyberpunk/goth feel, which has always been a major peeve."
1,Its compleate rubbish,"When White Wolf ended the World of Darkness and quickly replaced it with new games, I thought it might be interesting. What they did instead was do a horrible job of writing, along with taking bits of the old games and just obscured them. People seem to love it since they do spice it up with pictures and such just to make people think its better than it really is. The only good quality of any nWoD book is the dice system. Vampire: The Requiem is one of the worst Roleplaying games, followed up by Werewolf: The Forsaken. Do yourselves a favor by saving your time and money and just stay away from these games."
4,a better game,"I was pleased with Requiem. It made more sense than the old Masquerade and its myriad clans etc. The same problem is lurking in the background with this version with the potential of a zillion bloodlines to start up but in this game the Storyteller has much more control over what they want to include. I don't see that it would be too hard to convert an existing Masquerade game to this system, since no one's sure what the orgin of vampires is. Of course, you'd have to ignore the ""end of the world"" part;)"
3,Vampire NWOD,"When I purchased this role play book I was expecting it to be better than the old world of darkness. It isn't. I do realize that one has to go forward in games. It is an experiance I know too well. But for as long as White Wolf has been doing the Vampire series. Well, the new vampire system sucks. It is to the point that I don't even want to play the immortal clans any longer. The stories are interesting and all but that is all they are, intresting and nothing else."
2,perpetuates (racial) stereotypes,"Some reasons why I dislike this move and think it typical of white-American film:1. The white man was a perfect father and husband2. ONLY reason a white mother could ever be single is because her husband died.3. White mom is a good mother b/c she runs herself ragged trying to please her spoiled teenager4. Black couple is divorced (at least they were married in this one)5. Black female is angry/bitter at her ex-man6. Black man is a jerk and poor excuse for a father.7. There were more gay male hairdressers than female hairdressers working in that salon.How many of these movies are out there? Let's start with Imitation of Life and count forward...Gave it 2 stars only b/c the girls were athletic, the team was pretty diverse, and the original soccer coach was funny. One he left the scene it was downhill from there. Did not finish watching."
2,Could have been good,"If you don't mind multiple unnecessary sexual innuendos, then by all means plop your kids in front of this one. I'm not sure who this movie was supposed to be geared for, but I had to fast forward through a bunch for my 11 & 12 year old girls. I guess I'm a little old fashioned, but I have to say I'm getting tired of even PG movies being filled with it. Examples? Homosexual hairstylists going on and on about how badly they want this male coach. A divorcee going on and on about who her husband is dating and rubbing all over the woman dressed as a coach. Then the big kiss between these two women. Anyhoo, if that doesn't bother you, then, it's a kinda cute movie."
1,Too many sexual references,"I'm not sure why this movie was rated so highly from the others. It had way too many sexual references to be even shown to teenagers. It's as though it's so common and acceptable that when two men or two women or two of anyone kiss and grope, we just laugh. Why do most films these days have to have a gay theme, also? The language was also shotty. It would have been a great movie with a great theme of the mother wanting to see her daughter happy. That's about all I saw good about it. Don't buy or rent it. There are other movies worth your time. Your kids may thank you for your values when they get older."
5,Great Movie for families and teenagers- everyone can enjoy,I have kids ranging from 6 years to 15 years old (boys and girls)- everyone loved this movie. My teenage daughter is inviting her girlfriends over this weekend to watch it. It is a fun movie with a great nice message. This is a keeper!
3,Good kid movie,"Predictable, low production values, acting is pretty good. A great movie for my soccer loving 11 year old girl.Annoying sequences of soccer games: the ball changes instaneously as does the weather and the editing is VERY choppy. A lot of close in shots of girls' cleats running around."
2,For U10s,"Bought this DVD for my 12 yr old soccer-playing daughter. She made fun of the crappy pitches, not that she plays on perfect grass herself. The production value just wasn't there, and the movie was too silly for her; might be suitable for little kids."
1,Not a good battery for the money,"I bought this battery for my canon s40. It lasted about ten recharging cycles, about two months. Then it can not be fully charged anymore. Every time I put it into charger, the light on the charger blinks between red and green after a few minute. This battery is supposedly warranted for three years. But when I called Energizer for help, they told me to send the battery and $5.45 shipping fee for them to send me another one. I don't think I should risk more money and time with these guys again."
2,Leaks!!!!,Lid will leak when tipped unless you really tighten it down. My wife and kids can't apply the amount of torque necessary to make it work. I would avoid this until they re-design.
2,Love it But!!!,"I bought one for myself and my husband. I love them. I can put one tray of ice and fill it with tea. It will last me all day at work. Please understand that I use this ""every"" day, seven days a week. Unfortunately, I noticed while cleaning them that a black residue will build up under and around the seal in the lid. Being very careful not to tear it, I remove it to clean the seal and under it. Well after doing this for a year the seal finally broke.The but in my title is because you cannot buy new seals or lids. You would have to buy a new keg and I won't do that. Without the seal the keg is useless. I am very much into recycling and keeping as much out of the landfill as possible. The keg is like new and I can't see throwing them away after using it for a year. Not sure what they are made of (besides plastic and steel band) or if they can be recycled. (There is no recycle logo on the bottom)For me I will not buy anymore unless they start selling replacement seals"
1,Very low quality chocolate,"What a waste of money!!!!!! Based on other customer's review I gave it a try. I bought 6 packs right away, White Chocolate, Milk Chocolate and Dark Chocolate (2 packs each)The only good thing about this chocolate is that it melts easily but it taste horrible. Super sweet and very cheap quality. I'm throwing out the rest of the package."
5,Great Early Bonnie,"This compilation includes five of the ten songs from her original It's A Heartache album plus a lot of added great stuff! No Jim Steinman here but he wasn't needed, her voice steals the show! I love most of her later recordings too but there's just something young and fresh about these songs that makes them stand out...if you like her voice you will love this album!"
5,"Gaia, Earth Goddess",I've loved this music for years. Just wanted a spare copy. The music is inspirational while doing creative projects. It was always playing while I wrote a book.
4,Creativity is thr reason,"to buy this product. I described it to my granddaughter and she got excited at just the idea of it. If you are buying it from an AMAZON reseller, though, please beware. 3 of the four sellers I tried sent me the book without the word tiles, even though their description did not delete the word tiles or specifically note that they were not included. Without the word tiles, any other parts they sell are not usable. It might be my fault for trying to get a good deal except that I only bought from sellers who had ""like new"" quality on their descriptions of the product. BUy carefully and your child will enjoy this product."
5,great book - learn and have fun at the same time while expressing yourself,"awesome book, I bought several as presents and everyone loved them, great for kids 9 -16 years old."
3,Useful but not Profound,"Contains much useful data at a beginner's level for all three faiths: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim, but does not discuss ostacles to mutual respect and cooperation, such as how each faith criticizes the other two.Good to provoke thought and/or as a basis for group discussion about htow the US can productively and responsibly adapt to being the more pluralistic society we are inevitably becoming."
2,"Three Faiths, One God",I received the item and it appeared to be in excellent condition but I bypassed the free delivery and paid so that it would arrive on time for a friend to take before leaving the country. It arrived 2 days later than it should have which cost me the postage of mailing it overseas. I was not happy about that at all. Next time I will just use your free shipping option when I qualify.
2,NOT the same God,"This film makes a fatal assumption: that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (worshiped by Jews and Christians) is the same as Allah. In fact, they are two separate entities. What a pity this film doesn't make that point."
4,A mistaken reviewer...,"I'll admit that perhaps the discussion of the three faiths is a bit oversimplified. Nevertheless it is just ignorant to boast that the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jesus, and Moses is not the God of the Muslims. In fact, the term Judeo-Christian is recently being reassessed as inapplicable and Judea-Christian-Islamic used in its stead. This is similar to the academic movement to use terms such as Before the Common Era (BCE) and Common Era (CE) as opposed to the overtly Christian CE/AD in terms of historical dates.Our society needs to aknowledge that these forms of religious discrimination are closed-minded and historically innacurate. Adam, Noah, and Jesus and Mary are all figures within the Islamic historical tradition and this documentary illuminates such instances of likeness between the three faiths. That does not make it a weak film. It only directs us to reasses our weak intellects."
1,Dont bother,Dissapointing cheap electronic organthe only good Real organ and chimes is John Gart ''Silent Night'which is unavailable here
1,that was an expensive box of trash bags,"I have ordered this product two times now and both times my order was as follows...four boxes of 50 count per box. At a cost of 32.00 (approximately). I paid the total at the time of order and both times I only received 1 box !!! Each time I have had to call and request a refund. I'm not upset at the cost, I don't understand how this can have happened two times. I love this product but 32.00 for 1 box of 50 bags is a bit much. I hope this problem gets fixed soon, as I will need trash bags soon."
4,Love these bags,"Can't always find these Glad Handle Tie Tall Kitchen Bags in my stores. So instead of spinning my wheels looking for them, Amazon makes it easy for me to order periodically. When I first started using them years ago, the bags were a little stronger. Wish they were now, but I would still buy them as they are today. Easy to tie and remove from can."
5,Perfect for me!,A couple of years ago I bought a trash can for these trash bags. I am disabled so these are easier than other bags but stores stopped holding them. I love being able to get them through amazon.
5,"I'm very glad, :O)",These are absoluetly wonderful. I really don't care for the draw string kind. And with the shaped handles there is no more guessing which end is the open one. They are nice and strong. I love them!
5,BUY THIS DVD< YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!,"This film really it home for me. It reminded me so much of MY OWN prom experience. I laughed in so many scenes, but it was refreshing to see a movie that was able to depict so many universal themes of adolescence and teen angst without having to revert to cheesiness or overdone raunchiness to get the laughs. The star of the movie, Danny, is a guy that so many can identify with and relate to. My favorite character was Camille, who was refreshing and delightful. She seemed so real, I felt as though I already knew her.Gather a group of high school friends together, or watch it with your own teens. You will truly enjoy this DVD."
5,Underrated intelligent comedy!,"This totally threw me for a surprise. The marketing made it seem like it was going to be another American Pie movie. I was wrong. This is a well-paced, smart comedy that stars William H. Macy as a HILARIOUS down-on-his luck dad. I don't know why I didn't hear about this movie before and just came upon it when I was looking up Macy's recent credits. I thought this was a fresh approach to the teen comedy genre. If Woody Allen did a teen comedy, I can see this being his approach. Really enjoyed it."
2,Ehh,"Typical teen story of boy trying to find a date for the prom, but holding out for the ""perfect"" date until the ""girl next door"" who WANTS him to ask her finally accepts another offer. Boy is refused by Dream Date and so is left with nobody to take. ""Bart got a room"" is sort of the running theme, meaning that anybody who is anybody (even Bart) is going. William Macy is mildly amusing as the divorced father trying to make sense of his newly single life. Not a bad movie, but not a great one either."
2,Another comedy with no actual comedy,"Never laughed once here, not even close. William Macy kind of steals the show as the dad obsessed with finding a girlfriend online. The rest are forgettable. The story line concerns a kid's indecision about which girl to ask to the prom until he runs out of time. Naturally, there's a happy ending. Just wasn't funny, but not a real stinker."
3,funny but not poignant,"I originally saw that this movie was available for Amazon Vine but I didn't get have a chance to request it. I then had to watch it to see if it was any good, to sort of see if I missed out on anything by not requesting it. Bart Got a Room is a feel-good comedy about the trial and tribulations that one boy must face to secure a date for the prom. It touches on the insecurities and mostly sends a positive message about family and growing up. William H. Macy is delightful to watch as the dad of the main character."
2,"Seeing it once is enough, give it a rent","Video with grain and drab color. 1970's look.The storyline is one that has been seen before. A male high school senior who isn't in the popular clique is trying to find a girl to take to the prom. He wants to take girls that aren't interested in him. The one girl that wants to go with him, he isn't interested in except for friendship. When he finally realizes she really is the girl for him to take, she is going with someone else. He does end up at the prom. I won't spoil the ending for you but we've seen it before.The acting is fair. I didn't find any part of the movie funny. It was mildly entertaining."
2,Angst Galore,"This film was riddled with the usual teen angst surrounding prom date, prom night, sex, peer pressure. For main character Danny Stein, played by Steven J. Kaplan, the challenge is to actually find a prom date. There are a few moments of humor but for the most part it was painful and entirely relatable. The cast was great, though Macy was particularly cringeworthy as the embarrassing single father. Alia Shawkat's role stood out as Camille, the dutiful but smitten best friend. While this film isn't going to be the one that represents a generation, it's fun and captures the ease of south Florida culture very well."
3,Decent Movie,"Bart got a Room is a decent movie. You have seen this type of movie before though...prom date, prom night, and the stress and peer pressure that goes along with the prom. This movie has its funny moments so it is definetely worth renting but I'm not sure about buying it. This is NOT a movie for little kids so please keep this in mind. The sad thing is most of us can relate to this movie in one way or the other."
3,Fun Teen Angst/Prom/Date coming of age flick,You have seen it all before one way or another. Sometimes better; often worse. This is a good humorous look at that awfully charged teen period. Macy is one of my favorites and was my primary draw here. He did not disappoint. An enjoyable and entertaining entry in that genre.
3,Not as Fun as a Bar Mitzvah,"It's not a bad movie, good actors (I watched it because of William Macy playing the worthless but loving, in all the worst ways, Dad), but it's just a tired story: coming of age, the hero wants to ask out a beautiful, blond(ho-hum) to the prom so he can feel important and at least measure up to Bart the nerd who has a room for the night.In the process he blows off his longtime girl friend and confidant and takes lots of lame advice from his divorced parents and so-called friends. He races around the whole, short movie trying to make this his biggest, best night of his life. Will he discover what's really important and stop being a putz?There are bright spots: Macy figuring he's hit the jackpot with provocative date prospectus Jennifer Tilly, and Macy performing straight man for a camera smoozing, scene stealing infant in a hoody- I didn't hear a word Macy said. The movie's so-so, but that baby deserves a Best Supporting Oscar."
3,Been There...Done That...and Been There Again,Seen it all before. But we'll see it all again and this one has a certain quirkiness that endears it to you as it moves along. The cast is good. The story is prom night. The humor is charming rather than nyuk nyuk. All in all not a bad effort and certainly worth an evening. Macy has an unerring eye for just the right role and he reigns in his considerable talent and doesn't overpower his castmates. For an independent effort it is above average and below great. I give it a seven. It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.
4,Amusing Teen Tale,"Featuring a wonderful cast of familiar faces,William H.Macy,Cheryl Hines and the cute freckled girl from Arrested Development Alia Shawkat,this heartfelt tale about the torture in life regarding the Prom was fun to watch.There's a pop-up production notebook as an added feature that tells all about the movie and the actors in it & lists the amazing amount of family and friends that the director/writer Brian Hecker managed to fill his screen for free.Besides the mentioned family and friends,there are many familiar faces mixed in including Jennifer Tilly and Jon Polito (from several Coen Bros Films)and several others of note.The movie zips along pretty quickly and it's only 79 minutes long but fun.The film won 'Best of Fest' awards at several film Festivals around the country"
1,Bart was Boring,"Bart Got a Room was billed as ""gut bustingly funny"" by a ""professional"" reviewer. I must have missed something while watching this film. I did not find any gut busting moments of humor. In fact, this movie had a forced feel that it was trying to hard to be special, and it just did not reach that level. William H. Macy is one of the few bright spots in this otherwise forgettable film. One star. zzzzzzz"
2,Tries to be a lot more than it is,"I would say the movie was somewhere between ""OK"" and ""not all that great."" I watched it with a few friends and we all pretty much had the same impression. None of us felt it was really worth buying and certainly not worth again.You basically have your typical Prom/Date movie on a low budget. The general acting wasn't too bad, but there just wasn't much going on during the movie. We found it had just enough going on to keep you watching through the end, but that's about it. It had it's funny moments, but what teen/date movie doesn't?If you wanted to find something to add to a Netflix queue and ran out of movies to watch, I'd say go for it. Otherwise, there are far more entertaining and interesting movies like this out there."
3,Not Much New,"Same old teen issues of high school friends dreaming of romance but keeping each other on the back burner. I have no doubt much of this was informed by personal experience, it's just not that interesting. The supporting cast does what they can but aren't quite colorful enough to hold our interest either."
2,it's ok...,The best of this video are the 1st 2 solo pieces by jack wilkins.The rest of it is pretty dry and not very swinging...
3,Niki is a bit....boring.,"The first 40% of the book were interesting. High pace from laudas youth and family troubles to his first foray into racing and the Ferrari years. Then, somehow, after nurnburg crash it lost pace and direction."
3,Unique and fairly good produce,"This pacifier is a good idea and works well. As described, it does close when dropped, keeping it clean. The plastic outside of the device is bulky and seemingly uncomfortable for my baby, however. There is little air movement between the pacifier and the skin, like other pacifiers, due to how this pacifier must be designed to close when dropped. Overall a good product."
3,"Great concept, but made me nervous","Purchased this to try, since I thought it was an interesting concept, but found that it made me nervous, because it would pinch shut while on my son's mouth. In addition, it also left an indentation around his lips because of the tension. Overall it's a great idea, but it didn't do well for me."
2,"nice concept, but not ideal for baby","The concept is nice, but as other reviewers pointed out, it closes AS it hits something, not before. My bigger problem with it is that it's hard, and not soft like most other pacifiers, so his face can get red while sucking on this. If he were to hit something with it in his mouth, he could probably get really hurt, so we just don't use this because of that."
2,Great idea . . .,"The idea is great, but it just doesn't work. The sides that snap closed to keep the pacifier clean dig into my baby's cheeks. It doesn't always close before it hits the floor, either. It was disappointing."
2,Great concept but poor design.,"The part that closes is bulky and due to that, my son barely gets half the binky in his mouth. He has to suck really hard to keep it in, which not only leaves a red mark around his mouth but an indent! The concept is great, I just wish it was better designed. We're just going to stick to regular binkies from now on."
1,Don't wast your money!,Did not like this item at all. The wings on the pacifer would not stay open so that the baby could use it. This item went in the trash!
2,sanitizing,"I never even got to try this product out. I sanitized it, as the packaging said I could. Prior to sanitizing it, it closed with a snap. Afterwards it slowly closed, but never completely. Even after pressing the sides together, it would not stay closed around the nipple.If you get this product, do not boil or steam it. Just wash it in hot water with a mild soap."
3,"Great idea, needs some work","My 8 week old son actually really liked this paci, but it leaves little red crescent indents on each cheek. It works well & closes like its supposed to, but the red marks it leaves are a little concerning."
2,isbutterflys,mydoesnt like it because it keeps closing on him when he has it in his mouth my grandson get very upset and cries.
5,"Perfect Little ""Plug""",I was absolutely delighted when I received the RazBaby Purple Dots pacifier. Looking forward to seeing how it works when the baby comes.
4,The Magus,Originally released by Vampire Records in 1989 but later re-released by Osmose. The band are a bit twisted but that makes it even more to learn about them but the best album released was THE MAGUS. 1000 copies of the original vinyl was released and pressed in Sydney. 24 Green Marble vinyl was also pressed when vinyl was left from another pressing. 1000 The Magus CDs where released in 94 and are still available from Vampire Records. Agonising the Dead still gives me shivers and the horrors
5,Wow my lip's burn and head sweats,"Besids wings and boneless wings,I found my self using this on hamburgs,hot dogs,scrambled eggs,etc. I would recomend this hot wing sauce to anyone.A lot of flavor and a real nice kick ass heat."
2,auto body repairing and refinishing,"This book is very basic, written in textbook form. There are even tests at the end of each chapter. This book is written for high school students, and doesn't have alot of technical info"
4,My things,"I couldn't wait to get this book, cause I was behind in class n I couldn't get it in Barbados n now I have it I up to time."
4,A good reference in auto bodies,This book contains many description of auto bodies repairing...easy to understand in general...
1,DISAPPOINTING RUN TIME,I only got about 2 hours of run time per charge out of this battery so I returned it for my money back and picked up a batterygeek universal dvd battery which is now giving me 7+ hours of run time per charge.
4,Not so bad!,"When I saw the other rviews I just had to say something. We've had a pair of these for several years and we love them. They do not like having mobile phones around but otherwise they are great. I don't know about speakers quitting working, etc., but I wonder if those folks' batteries went dead. We did have to replace a battery once."
2,cannot recommed,I own these speakers and have been quite disappointed. In my view the quality of operation is very poor. My suggestion is to avoid them.
4,Revealing look at women's strength and power,"Eavesdrop on any group of women lunching at the next table and you are likely to witness laughter, tears, support, commiseration and collaboration in action. Entrepreneur Vickie Milazzo identifies how women can best utilize these natural feminine capabilities to achieve life and career success and fulfillment. Milazzo dedicates an insightful, thorough chapter to each of the ""10 Feminine Forces"" she has identified. She uses personal stories and the experiences of successful women to coach you to new, unexplored heights. Sometimes her attempt to motivate through her personal saga crosses the line from inspiring to self-congratulatory. Yet, if you set aside this editorial flaw, you have a well-scripted formula for success. We recommend this book to all women who share a spark, a dream and the desire for a richer, fuller life."
5,A Woman's Best Friend,As a strong believer in the professional and entrepreneurial potential of women I am glad to see this book. The author presents many fine plans of action to help women propel through their careers and reach their goals. I only hope that the author releases a book for us men.
4,Versatile product,"The Brenthaven Crossover is a nice well made and designed product.It fits my travel needs well, tripling as a backpack, at saddle bag, briefcase.The pockets are well thought out, zippers seem sturdily constructed. Handles are well placed and the briefcase handles can be hidden. Great price since model is discontinued... <$70Bought it for my MacBook Pro 15.4"". Not as snug as I would like I can include a laptop sleeve.I figured this will better fit my future MacBook Pro 15 unibody, which is longer/wider.Minuses for me: color- would want darker, business-like black. Tighter fitting laptop compartment or an adjustable velcro strap would more securely protect laptop. A better quality or better padded shoulder strap.You may want to check it out in person, with your laptop, before buying."
4,will purchase again,I noticed a slight difference in the tone of my skin in 4 weeks I've used it.It has even help my skin keep clear of my adult onset acne.Its gentle but feels clean when I'm done. I love the scent & all you need is one pump of it & the bottle last a long time.
3,Not as Bad.,"Sellout album? I think not. I think This cd is closer to The Old Vandals Than ""Look What I Almost Stepped in"" Some of these songs return to the Classic Vandal Style, Like ""LIttle Wierdo"" and The other songs are good Too. Though this cd is not the best, not even close, it is still good. And It is not at all A Sell out Album."
2,Dissapointing,"I really like the Vandals' older music, even Look What I Almost Stepped In, but this cd was horrible. Basically, if you like the Vandals, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. It is a complete sellout album. The songs are all Blink-182 clones. I hate to see such a great group go the way of all that Blinkin Park hype. Peace Through Vandalism is much better. Don't waste your money."
3,great expectations,"After the first listening it just didn't do it for me. After the second and the third and the fourth my opinion didn't change very much. Why? The music is still great but the songs seem kinda uninspired. After the brilliant ""Look what I almost stepped in..."" I expected a worthy follow-up but the new songs just seem like leftovers from that album. Hats off to songs like ""Appreciate my honesty"", ""Little weirdo"" and the hilarious ""The unseen tears of the albacore"" but the rest is stretched a little too thin. ""Disproportioned head"" is not all that funny and the ""My brain tells my body"" and ""My brother is gay"" are simply redundant.Don't get me wrong, this is not a BAD album at all, but compared to their previous..."
3,"Great album, disappointing CD","I love this album, and have had an LP of it for years. But I was disappointed in the CD. It sounds as if the mixing of the various instruments was changed, and the recordings are not as enjoyable as they are on the LP."
5,Romantic weekend music - especially on rainy weekends,"One of the most soothing, relaxing CDs I have heard and own...complete with background distant thunder, train whistles, and sounds of rain. May be a little melancholy but I have loved this beautiful orchestra instrumental since college on the LP version and was truly thrilled to have found it back in the 90's in CD format.Too bad it has gotten to see so expensive. A re-release for this Stormy Weekend CD would definitely be something to look forward to finding.Great listening for lovers, dinners for two or just quiet listening while reading a book. A must have if you can find it!"
3,A great start on a healthy path,If you're looking for a place to begin your quest for health this book and metabolic typing is definately a place to start. This book contains very good information and is written in common terms anyone can understand.
1,This book was a waste of my time.,"Don't bother to buy the book. I am going to summarize it for you. ""Some people increase blood pH from Type 1 foods and decrease blood pH from Type 2 foods, while others decrease blood pH from type 1 foods and increase the blood pH from Type 2 foods."" I literally could not finish the first two chapters of the book in either of two attempts because of the massive repetitiveness and dryness. For example, the statement in quotes above must have been repeated 10 times in the first two chapters in almost identical wording each time. In addition, the case studies provided are not convincing. For example, on page 23 there is a case study of an individual who was 100 lbs overweight. After following the authors protocol, the individual was able to lose 7 lbs in twenty days. That is not so impressive."
2,Nutrition solution,"This book is an average read, it is merely a reworking of gerorge watson's classic, nutrition and your mind. It would be interesting to someone new to metabolic typing but is a pale comparison to the metabolic typing diet by william Wollcott. This is the ultimate book on nutrition and covers the oxidation system as found in this book. Howvever, it presents the bigger picture and shows where the importance lies of this one system (Dr Kristal's book) amongst the other 8 sytems within the body."
5,great!,The Coralife works just great as it says no complaints here it was a easy install.just snap and turn on
2,I cannot believe everyone loved this book,"I am a big fan of Ms.Robards books but I really did not care for this one. The heroine wanted to be respected by the hero,but she continually threw herself on him when she hardly knew him. Come on! And as for him,when,after they declared their true feelings for each other,he ranted at her and called her a ""bit.."",well,I gave up."
1,""" This is NO Love Story!""","1 star is TOO Much for this Nightmare of a ""romance"". It deserved a 0! I am a fan of Karen Robards, some of her books are favourites of mine,great reads, with real and heartfelt stories. However, this book is terrible, the so called ""hero"", is not only cruel- ""He's a RAPIST, there is nothing else to call what he did! Even after he so called ""discovers"" his feelings there is never any sort of apology for his Dispicable treatment of her. The ""heroine"" has no dignity or sense of self preservation. There is NO romance in this book. I enjoy a Wide variety of books, but I could find Nothing to recommend this book. I can not understand any of the Positive reviews. Unless, you enjoy reading about physical and emotional abuse do not waste your time or money! If you want to read something good by Karen Robards try ""Morning Song"""
5,Excellent and sizzling book,I loved this book! I read it twice. Once when it was published and about a week ago. It takes you away from reality and you get involved with the characters. I loved both characters. I will reread it again in the near future.
3,O.K. the hero is a jerk!!,But I guess i love jerks. Any way I could suspend disbelief for a few hours and enjoy this book. It is not PC but so what. It was a fun read for me. I really liked the whole african experience but the american part didn't live up to snuff. I hated the rushed end but still it was o.k. Nothing great but good for an escape from the norm.
1,boring,"boring, boring, boring, and I did not like sam at all or Lisa, for that matter, because she put up with sams chauvanistic attitude, especially concerning her money! He is probably one of the worst and unlikable heroes I have ever read."
3,Cheesy but that's what you would expect,"The movies are expectedly hokey but hilarious. I love ridiculous horror movies, so this was the ideal collection. Not going to win any Oscars but worth a good laugh."
3,"Good movie watching for the price, nothing spectacular","Well I bought this 4 Pack because of the reviews about the movie Curtain and the price. After viewing the poor quality DVDs, I can't say that I am overly disappointed or thrilled. Curtains could have been WAY better but not a bad flick. The 80's horror feel is definitely there, but for having 6 woman in a horror flick with no T&A; was the biggest disappointment. Room 33 was entertaining and perhaps my favorite of the 4 movies. (Again tho... roller derby woman and no T&A;?) My biggest problem with it would be no gruesome death scenes and the lack of a finished story. It kept me watching and had great potential. For the price, you cant go wrong. Just don't expect stellar quality or great acting, ...watch them because you like B horror movies! Like meWorth the money"
5,This GRAMMA loves loud music...,I have purchased 3 GRAMMAs from Amazon for home use...All 3 are identical in quality...I have one under my subwoofer (Infinity PS212)and one each under my 2 huge tower speakers (Infinity SM-155s)...The GRAMMAs do the job they were made for... de-coupling the speakers from the floor and tightening up bass...Very happy with my purchase...
3,Gramma,I have gotten no acoustic improvement out of my sub with this and didn't expect any. If you are buying this thinking it will make your sub sound better you are mistaken.If you are buying it to help keep some of the things in your room from rattling it may be helpful but so is a bathroom rug or a piece of carpet. I basically got it because the bathroom rug I was using looked tacky and I didn't have the time to make something like this myself and save some money. I did staple a piece of black felt to the top of it though so that it doesn't look so cheap.I have a Klipsch RW12-d that weighs about 50 lbs and it has no problem holding the weight.
5,"Built tough, great fit for my subwoofer.","I bought this to put my Paradigm DSP-3200 subwoofer on, to stop it from vibrating my floor. It worked like a charm. I can't say that it really tightened the bass or anything like that, but it did help with vibration and getting the sub off the floor."
1,Weak metal,"Admitadely I torque on things quite a bit, as I have to absolutely eliminate leaks in my RV water source (otherwise the leaks get expensive!). But it really shouldn't break before I even turn the water on. The metal just snapped when I twisted it onto the faucet... Not worth the hassle of returning it, but I guess it's back to the old brass Y-valve for me."
5,very informative,I really liked this book. I am happy to add it to my library of embroidery books. Well worth it.
4,Last great album of the old Ramones,"Following the artistic and commercial failure of the Phil Spector experiment ('End of the Century') the Ramones came roaring back with this very strong album reminiscent of their more pop-sounding later 70s work. 'We Want The Airwaves' and 'KKK Took My Baby Away' are 'Ramones hits', but the record is loaded with good tracks -- 'All's Quiet On The Eastern Front', 'It's Not My Place (In The 9 To 5 World)' and especially 'She's A Sensation'. The Ramones had a lot of good songs still left in them, but in many ways this was their last great album. Well worth owning."
5,Pleasant Songs,"I admit to being a fan of the Ramones. They are one of the most underrated and complex bands ever. They have a ton of 3 minute songs, featuring a handful of chords and fast-paced guitar work. Yet, their music is so much more and that is very evident on this album.A few of these songs are silly in concept (The KKK Took My Baby Away), but the music and delivery is fantastic. A few of these songs are almost like bubblegum pop (It's Not My Place...), but again, they are delivered so tightly and energetically, that they succeed.In some ways, this is not the traditional product by the Ramones. Yet, it is typical Ramones in that it is what they want. There is some growth in maturity and there is some silly fun. Best of all, it all works.This is one CD that should not be overanalyzed. It should just be enjoyed and savored.--Johngy Ramone"
4,Bubblegum Punk at its best!,"This is the Ramones at there most bubblegum music phase. My faves include ""Don't Go"",""She's a Sensation"",and ""7-11"". If all the songs were like these on this release it would of been a 5 star. Only some tunes lack excitement. Still a good release from The greatest punk band ever!"
5,Very Pleasent Indeed!,"This is easily one my favorite Ramones' albums and I have them all. What is so special about it, are the many quiet masterpieces on it that have somehow got lost in the shufle over the years. I am talking about songs like ""Sitting In My Room"" and ""This Business is Killing Me."" Moreover, the pleasing Beach Boy-like melodies really make this a pleasent listening experiment. Great stuff from America's greatest rock band."
1,Solid Gold Ramones,"A chance to revisit the early years of the Ramones,after faltering Pleasant Dreams put the band back on track. A must for every dedicated fan"
4,"Old, but still good","""Monday..."" is part of a series of books about the Rabbi,which I have'nt read yet. I found this one in a used book store, and bought it mostly for the provcative religion-related title. It turned up to be a thrilling mystery. It was written in the mid-70s, and this is shown in the plot (Arab terrorists in Jerusalem, etc.), but that only means that you learn a bit about the way Israel was (at least, in American eyes) in the mid-70s, and about sections in the Jewish community in America at that time. On the other hand, I guess that you must have basical knowledge and interest in the Jewish Community/Judaism/Israel in order to enjoy this book."
1,"Content is poor, however price was right","As an accomplished web developer, I can personally attest to this book's complete disregard for coding standards, security, and overall being of any value to anybody since the early 2000's.I paid $0.45 for it, since I needed it for a course, and I was appalled at the content...""Server side validation isn't necessary as long as you have good client side security""WAIT, WHAT?Please PLEASE do not buy this book, and make a website. As somebody who does this for a living, it is painful having to fix sites that people wrote with no experience.Look up any of the PHP and MySQL books by O'Reliey...They're boring, but at least they teach effectively."
1,YOU DO NOT GET WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE!,Only bought this item becuase the picture shows a pump action bottle. Paid double for this product that what they sell for at Walmart becuase I needed a pump action bottle.Was so upset when I opened the box.Really want to return but am not willing to pay another $5 for shipping and I am on bed rest!!!
3,Nice but outdated,"Nice book , well writed, but it does not cover the latest technologies (Flex, Re-flex, In-Flexion)"
2,Not good for oily skin.,"I like Stila products and I was excited to try the illuminating tinted moisturizer. I liked that it had a Spf 15 and that it would provide minimal coverage. Although I loved the way my skin felt when I wore it, it made my skin look very greasy. It only got worse as the day went on, even after I applied powder on top in hopes of toning it down. I'm glad that I was able to find out that it wasn't for me by using a deluxe sample than by buying a whole tube. Maybe people with dry skin have better results."
5,Adds a nice glow,"This is great stuff. Similar products include MAC's pearl color base. Another similar product is L'Oreal's Glam Tint in Aura. The discontinued Revlon Skinlights costs around 1/2 as much. Lorac also has one, in a combo concealor which is good for travel. The Skinlights line has been discontinued, which is a shame. Perhaps if we write to Revlon, they will bring it back."
2,not for me,not sheer enoughits more like makeup will have to go to a store where different products can be tested personally
3,stila,"This tinted moisturizer has a sticky feel and an ugly color. I guess for the price it was a good deal, but I would not buy it again."
3,Okay,"I used many brands before for makeup especially foundation, bb cream, and others. Seeing how this is a tinted moisturizer it doesn't cover as much a foundation. It has some shimmer to it which makes sense since it is an illuminating moisturizer. However the only thing I don't like about it is that it gives a slight yellow cast and you have to shake it up really well to get the oil and the product to mix in properly. The design of the bottle is okay. However, for the price, amount of product, and the quality it may not be as work it. I'm not sure if I would recommend this but it is an okay product if you need light coverage and have nice looking skin."
4,"Don't Get Mad, Get Even","For Whitney Houston, the past few years remained as difficult and as unbelieveable as you could expect from her. Still, she has ways of still showing her voice, and what she has to say about doubters. That really goes the same with Whatchulookinat, the first song released from Whitney Houston's 2002 record, Just Whitney. The song is a letter the tabloids for stalking and assault from the victim's point of view, Whitney. The song is a lot tougher than any of Whitney's other songs. Still, she also expanded a bit more within her family on this song, with thanks from her husband, Bobby Brown. I think it is a good quality song, and just listening to two sides of the story, not one. I still think that a lot of fans abandoned her because of the National Examiner, but her voice is still as exciting as it was years ago. Still, if you haven't heard the song, get Just Whitney."
1,Puhleeze!!,"I have no idea what Houston was thinking when she decided to release this junk as a single. Just the song title alone is enough to make my stomach going in a 180 spin. The beats are generic, predictable, and lifeless and the song overall is just a miserable failure at trying to aim at the TRL audience and it isn't helping Houston's floundering career especially with all the bad press surrounding her career. The song aims at trying to lash out at the media but the lyrics though, are simply immature and amateurish for someone who's had a career spanning over 15 years and it's saddening to see Whitney fall this low. I could think up of better lyrics from scratch in three hours. This single is just a pitiful waste of a comeback opportunity. >:-("
1,Whitney Goes Bust.,"What are WE looking at? The better question to ask is, ""what are we listening to?"" Whitney's kickoff single from her first album in four years finds our heroine biting back at reporters who hound the troubled diva. The single, co-produced by Bobby Brown, is so joyless and lyrically defensive, it makes Michael Jackson look emotionally secure. The last thing Houston needs to do is to portray herself as a victim. This single would stand a chance of redeeming itself if it were actually danceable, but even the groove in ""Whatchulookinat"" is bland and uninspired. If she continues releasing duds like this, her fans won't be ""lookin'"" or even listening to her anymore."
4,It's Time To Strike Back,"The single for WHATCHULOOKINAT is a must for avid Whitney fans. The song was leaked on the internet in late summer 2002, and it was basically Whitney striking back against the media, for twisting lies and being all up in her business. The song is catchy and infectuous, but it failed to capture the hearts of radio or listeners. The song itself is quite nice but I have to say the main reason to own this single is for the Thunderpuss Remix, it is excellent and perfect for club play (they play it all the time here at some of the clubs here...). The other remixes are nice, except I didn't care for the P Diddy remix, but overall if you are a fan of Whitney or Thunderpuss remixes, this is a must own single."
2,poor,"I don't think Whitney should've released this song.It's not exactly a terrible song.Actually its quite alright.But it ain't alright for someone like Whitney.The beats are generic,and the melody could easily have been something we heard before.Even though I am not fond of this single, I still have every intention of buying her upcoming cd.I just hope that this single is not a preview of the direction of the album."
4,"Whatchalistening to? You, Whitney.","""Whatchalookinat"", is the first single from Whitney Houston's latest release and her first studio album in 4 years, Just Whitney.The song is another attempt by Whitney to bash her critics (for a better song see ""In My Business"" from 1998's My Love Is Your Love). She is in good voice, but the song has very boring lyrics. That is the main reason I am giving it four stars.The P. Diddy mix is interesting. He complements Whitney nicely.The dance mixes by Thunderpuss and Full Intension are probably the worst ones done for a Whitney song in years, however, they have toped the Billboard Dance charts after just a few weeks in release, so maybe I am too critical.This is a nice addition to anyone's Whitney collection, but it did disappoint me somewhat."
2,Not as good as it could of been,"Whitney's always been good at making r and b ballads and dance tracks but this has got to be one of her poorest efforts to date. ""Whatcha lookinat"" is nothing more than a predictable, middle of the range track which sounds very similar to most of Destiny's Child's work on ""The Writing's On The Wall"".Sadly, Whitney also sounds a bit weary and she definitely looks worn down but she is almost 40 (or is she 40?).There's not much more I can say about this song because it's so average and I'm ashamed to say it's nothing more than a bland, tiresome beat. Whitney- you know you can do better!"
3,Sorry,I love Whitney Houston but this single was a mistake. Her voice has changed. Whether you believe this change is due to age or health problems or something else doesn't matter. There is a differnce. Her high notes just don't reach operatic heights like they used to. As much as I love Whitney I didn't like this song. Whatchulookinat is nowhere near her former pristine standards. I'll buy the album when it comes out but this single worries me.
2,"I Love You Dearly Whitney, But I Am REAL Mad At This Song!","Whitney is a consumate artist, and alas I'm afraid, more concerned with making her husband feel useful by allowing him to produce such a piece of trash as this. Even at it's worse, Whitney can still sing and I have every intention of buying the album when it comes out, but we all know Whitney can do better than this. I certainly hope this is no indication of the direction of the entire album!!!!!!!!"
5,"GREAT buy, Great Bargain!","This is a great gift set! It makes the items inside a great bargain too, since you'd spend more on each item by itself. A must have!"
2,just fantasy??,"this book looks atractive by its simplicity.first negative point: no index [which would have been a very small effort]have not seen anything ""working"" until now, as claimed by the writer.would be beautiful if all that is claimed [ or even a small part]would be usefull.i doubt it, but i will try the suggestions again and again, even with all the negative experience until now [anyhow it can't harm]"
4,Principles for Life and Leadership,"An excellant read, I still have an original autographed copy in hardback.Words to live by!Read it, learn it, live it."
5,Required Reading!,"The American Business community would do well to stop looking at college education as a qualification for leadership, and simply quiz applicants by the contents of this book!"
2,Ok,"I recently received my book in the mail. The weirdest thing, when I was deciding on which thai yoga book to buy, I read various reviews on various books. Since returning to the site, I don't see a single review on this book?? Maybe it's listed twice? Either way, I think the book is fairly good. If your more of a ""visual"" person much like myself I would recommend buying something different. Immediately, I was disappointed by the illustration (photos) in this book !!! They pretty much appear as if someone xeroxed them to the point much of the photo quality has been lost. Also, their in black and white. I would recommend this book to someone, as an additional reference to other books, dvd's, and resources on thai yoga."
1,Died also,"This product is junk. My batteries did fit and it did charge them..ONCE..I did not leave it plugged in or damage it. After the first charging I unplugged it, put it back in its box and put it on a shelf. The next time I needed to charge the batteries I took it off the shelf, took it out of the box, inserted the battery, plugged it in and NOTHING. I tried several outlets and still nothing. I left the battery in and left it plugged in thinking maybe just the indicator light had failed..still nothing..the battery is still good, it is the charger that failed after only one use. I have not had a lot of luck with the Skil line of battery powered hand tools. I am thinking of just spending some extra money and upgrading to something like DeWalt. My brother has had a set for years with no problems. I have gone through way too many Skil products."
1,Battery Charger Doesn't Last,"Ordered one charger, received it, plugged it in and it lasted about 5 minutes. Returned it and received a replacement. It lasted about 20 minutes before quitting. Was told by an employee of Lowe's that they have had to order several chargers for one customer (they don't sell this particular model) because they fail after a short time. Perhaps there needs to be better quality control because these chargers are not lasting."
2,First item sent was defective!,"The first charger came in just a couple of days. However, it was defective and did not put out any voltage at all. Before I attached it to my battery I ran a measurement test to protect my battery. During this measurement I discovered that the charger was defective. I did notify [...] and their customer service sent a replacement right away and I had it in a couple of days. The second item did indeed work and all is well."
2,Struggles to find...,"More info needs to be promulgated about items for sale... and/or better photos, so that proper decisions can be made on application of the item... Rec'd item and it was not correct for my application, but at $14 was not worth returning, to much hassle... An accurate picture of the item showing what batteries it actually would accomodate would have prevented a mistake..."
2,Book poorly written 3rd edition,"Many of the example problems take short cuts while trying to explain the material through practical problems. When reading the book one is forced to constantly, turn the pages backward for previous references in order to understand the short cuts. The book is in need of some serious editing. Nevertheless, not all engineering books get better with editing. Spotts, machine design, for example in the 6th edition is a Great Book! In the 8th edition, it is useless. This book has the potential to be a good textbook. However, in this form it is just about 3 pounds of paper and cardboard with a fancy cover. Not the worst textbook ever, but it made the list."
3,"Good for understanding theory, but contains typos and binding is poor quality","The explanation of basic robotics theory is good. Without question robotics is not a topic that should be approached casually. As an ME student or EE student even an introductory robotics course will require knowledge you gained all throughout your freshman and sophomore classes as well as your junior and senior level classes. The biggest drawback of this book that I found was the quality of the binding. A couple of weeks into the semester the pages started to come out in groups of 10 to 20 at a time. It seems the publisher used a very poor quality glue in making the text. When I took the class everyone else in the class had the same problem. For the sake of everyone else that might be using this book for a class I can only hope we got a bad batch, because the content in the book is quite good."
2,5' ficus tree,"This item was less than spectacular, i bought it for christmas presents and i was not happy with the quality. very sub-par."
2,MEH,"Better initial bight than oem but, they still fade at around the same speeds. And the initial dust is WAY too much, I have white wheels so it was even more noticeable. They have been on there for about a month and they seemed to have stopped ""dusting"" as much. I will never buy them again. Car is a 94 del sol si"
4,Good Chick Lit Book,"I read Smothering, another book by this author and found it enjoyable so I bought this book.While this book isn't the best chick lit book I have ever read it is an easy and fun read.The main character has to make decisions regarding family, friendship, career and love and altogether doesn't do a bad job. It is slightly boring in parts but all together I would recommend it."
3,Lost me about page 120,"While I enjoyed the characters and setting, I found myself pained by the implausible and contrived series of misfortunes in the first half of the book. Fans of the book of Job, or Candide, might be more willing to push through to the conclusion, where perhaps our heroine stands up for herself without tripping. It is perhaps a tribute to the realistically rendered characters that I found it too painful to witness more of the bad-luck coincidences that make up the plot."
4,Daring Darin,"In a time of Fabian and Avalon, Bobby Vee and Tommy Sands, Bobby Darin exploded through that bubble-gum morass with the style of Sinatra, the showmanship of Sammy Davis Jr., the impishness of Dean Martin and the social instincts of the activist sixties. He was showbiz, to be sure, but he was also artist. Listen to his reading of ""I Have Dreamed"" and try not to get annoyed at the woman laughing and the man talking in the background. (One didn't go to the Copa for artistry, I guess). Early on in the set, he segues into his mega-hit, ""Mack the Knife"", with a great tease line that is almost lost in the rattling laughter of Joe. E. Ross (""Car 54 . . . ""). But Darin nimbly recovers the moment with a smart nod to his colleague. He was style, he was class, he was artist - and you get a full measure of that as you listen to him at the Copa."
3,"good, not great","I bought this CD because I read a quote from Brian Setzer that said it ""swings like nobody's business."" I was jazzed to find a CD like that. This is not it. This album is good, but Darin does a few too many medleys, has little heat, and phrases like a bad Sinatra imposter; however, you could do worse."
5,Great Artist-Bad Quality,"5 stars for Bobby...1 star for audio quality. And, I dont mean because it's live you lose some of the sound...this is a case of the album being transferred at the wrong speed(too slow). This is one of the greatest live performances of Bobby Darin, however the downloads sound like they are morphed or are being played at the wrong speed. If you can find the previously released cd version of this album it is 50 thousand times better. Amazon please fix this, if this was your doing or get a better downloadable version up."
3,LIve at the Desert Inn is better,"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Bobby Darin fan. However, I was disappointed in this CD. Bobby is great as usual but this live performance did not translate as well to a CD as others I have heard. I could tell that everyone in the audience was having a great time, but on this particular CD, only being able to listen to the audio version of his performance took away from my enjoyment of the songs. All along I kept thinking that this was one performance where you just had to be there. I realize that this is a common problem in live albums, but I have other live albums and I've never felt this way before. In any event, if you are just beginning to buy Darin CD's and want a live performance, try his Live at the Desert Inn. Even though it was made in 1971 right before he went into the hospital and he was't feeling too great, I think the CD is much better this Copa one he made in about 1960."
3,Whether you like this book will depend on your photography style,"If you lean more towards wedding photojournalism, you'll find this book annoying. The author takes stab after stab at the photojournalistic style and concentrates on listing which images you can sell after the wedding.I found the photography examples rather cheesy and old. The ""Posing"" chapter starts with a full page image of a bride and groom (almost smack in the middle of the photograph) and the groom's arms hanging down to his sides. I'm new to wedding photography, but even I know that's poor posing! It has some good points, but I wasn't too impressed.If you're into Traditional style of photography, this is a very good book for you to read. The author breaks the wedding down to almost every kind of picture you should create and how to make it sell at the end. It will be useful to you.So far, after having read 4 separate books on wedding photography this is my least favorite."
1,Outdated!,"I was disappointed with this book. There were some good ideas such as formal posing, but otherwise, outdated. A better wedding photography book by far is ""Digital Wedding Photography"" by Glen Johnson."
2,Not good enough,This book lacks depth. It's OK if you're just starting but far too basic for anyone serious about wedding photography.
2,"Slick, but...","Israel's CD shops boast more local content than countries several times its size, and the music is often beautiful and exciting, combining western and eastern influences with serious poetry about life in the line of fire. Only the Hebrew language prevents Israeli artists from finding wider success, and these talented lads from a village outside Jerusalem have decided to embrace both English and straight American rock. The result is a slickly professional, easily accessible CD of completely undistinguished rock wallpaper whose best track is a pale version of a Tom Waits song. Pick any Waits CDs at random: it will be more fun."
4,FINE GUIDE TO WRITING,"This is ""A Guide to Writing with Readings,"" and does a good job in preparing a student for college writing (EN 101). It is written in a easy method of understanding, and moves the student right along at a reasonable pace.The text gives a step-by-step of writing a sentence, a paragraph and finally an essay. The lessons are interesting and the readings right on target. The index and table of contents are excellent and makes it easy for the student to find what he/she needs. I teach English at our lcoal community college and have found the text effective - the students seem to appreciate the flow of lessons. Good job!"
1,when is it going to get to here?,"My husband and I started school 5 weeks ago (we are in our 6th week) the book i ordered him was to arrive by november sixth (AT THE LATEST!)it's now the 10th, and we're still w/o the book, i spent over a hundred dollars on. i will never order from amazon.com again"
1,Buyers beware,"Seller claims items where shipped placed order on Feb. 8, 2010 and still have'nt received the book yet and today is March 4, 2010."
1,Mail Mishap,Seller emailed to relay that the post office contacted her as to the contexts of the package as it was torn open and context missing which I never received.
2,The never ending story,"I started reading Maggie Furey's book with ""Aurian"", never knowing that I would finish 3 books later and still be left hanging for a conclusion.I am disappointed that Ms. Furey creates a wonderful story, but always leaves the reader with ""To be continued....."""
4,"A ""flaming"" story!","Sword of Flame is a very exciting book!! But i thought that the final battle was overwith to fast!!The whole serie about Aurian is very good, and I hope that someone will make a film out of the books soon!!"
3,A neverending story,"Although the book is nice, it is a pity that the story has an open ending. All the books from this serie is one big story. You must read all the books before you know how it ends. I was not satisfied after each book, sure it is a good marketing strategy for the writer. You must buy every book but it is not nice for the reader! The story however is a real Furey one, nice..."
4,Not that bad,"This book continues the story begun in Aurian, and is quite an engrossing read. While the story on occasion is a little confusing, the basic plot elements mesh well with each other. Aurian and Anvar's relationship is becoming more interesting, and the betrayals and unfinished subplots makes a person want to scream. I simply cannot wait for the final book in this series"
4,Best of the sequels so far,"I really enjoyed this one. I thought the sub-plots and action was so much better than the second novel, and the author's exploration of many of what were minor characters until now was a great read. I've gone through this series non-stop, which is unusual for me, and I'm glad I bought the final book in the series with this one!"
1,supply your own ending,"First I read Aurian... and it was pretty good. Then I read the second installment and I thought, well, one more and it'll be over. The third, Sword of Flame, seemed headed for a neat ending, but alas, in the last few pages Furey manages to turn us around for a fourth volume. I was so frustrated that I sat down at the computer and wrote my own ending. You may want to do so too; or you could stop after reading ""Aurian"" and move on to some more productive activity, such as rereading Tolkien. Furey's problems as a writer have been accurately described by other reviewers of this book: for one thing, she needs to reduce her vast number of adjectives, and she'd be wise to stop telling us what the bad guys are thinking. And then there are the cliches. And people's inexplicable motivations and compulsions (Aurian's mother is a whole catalog of these). And... oh well."
4,Not As Bad As All That,"While hardly a masterpiece, this book is much better than the other reviewers here would have it - anybody who quotes Stephen King against this sort of book is applying the wrong kind of standards. Oblique, fractured: yes, but many of the stories find their own clipped rhythm, throwing out memorable sentence shards and effective little groups of images. But it's not for people who seek out vaguely pretentious 'literature' in order to ridicule it (don't they have better things to do? - you know, if you don't like a book, you don't have to keep reading, just drop it and go on to something else). I read it by the Lake in Central Park; maybe my image of the book is made rosier by the wonderful blue day we were having, but maybe not. Good. Three and a half points (rounded up to four to raise the average)."
3,Warning - Shipper sending wrong model,"I received a different model from Amazon. The one I have is missing the shape sorter and has less mobility. I contacted Amazon that I had received something different from what was advertised and they tried replacing with the correct one but just sent the same model I had received before. I gave up and kept the one I got and returned the other replacement since Amazon does not ship more than one replacement per their policy to avoid additioinal headaches. I like this toy, my son 12 months old enjoys it and I can see him playing with it more appropriately in the future. He currently bangs the cars and twirls the other characters around. However, i feel jipped for the money I paid and was trapped into keeping a toy I would rather not trouble with shipping back."
3,Not What I expected and I'm dissappointed,"I couldn't wait to wear this costume today for our company's Halloween party. A word to the wise . . . try it on! I ordered the correct size based on the company's sizing chart, but it didn't fit me at all (too small). I was actually hoping it wasn't going to be too big because I ordered a size bigger than I normally would have.This is a really cool costume, but to say that it is sized too small is an understatement. I was really disappointed when I had to go to the party with no costume. :-(Now, for Halloween, I have to go through the trouble of sending this back and finding a last minute Halloween costume for Saturday (today is Thursday). I am not a happy camper."
2,Missed sized so upset!,"An adult XL should equal a Ladies 18, and this was more like a Juniors XL so I could not wear it. I ended up having to put something together at the last minute. Couldn't return as it was Halloween so I am stuck with a costume that doesn't fit. Ellen"
5,Wickedly Wonderful,"What a Wonderful Costume! My daughter wore this in her high school production of the Wizard of Oz. It is authentic, comfortable and fit well. The costume comes in it's own garment bag which is really handy. There is no cape, however. Purchase with confidence."
5,Review of A Journey,Book was received promptly and in excellent shape. The book itself is outstanding. Colored pictures and text makes it well with the money
1,This has nothing to do with Wicca,"I don't understand how Wicca can even be in the title, this CD has nothing to do with Wicca."
1,Misleading Title vs. Content,This collection is completely mistitled for its content. Don't buy if you are looking for something Wiccan for your collection.
1,Wicca ???,"Maybe ""Frantic Goth"" or ""Wannabe Satanists"" would be a better name. I agree with the other reviewer -- this album has pretty much nothing to do with Wicca. Could be the band just doesn't understand Wicca, and glommed onto it, mistakenly thinking it had something to do with evil or ""Satan""? The band just needs a dictionary and a new name."
5,Blue Grass forever!!!,"I've used this scent since 1965, the year I emigrated to this country and have never found anything that worked as well for me! When first sprayed it is quite powerful, but then becomes a lingering frangrance and even if you don't notice it yourself, other people always comment how pleasant it is. Which is really what you want from a scent, like the taste of a good wine!!!!P. S. I've used it for so long, my daughter calls it ""Mommy Smell"" - I really like that!!!!!"
4,Not the original scent,"While this is a nice scent, it is not the original scent. I recently purchased the Blue Grass deodorant which was the original scent so thought I'd try this as well. I am disappointed."
4,Wonderful smell,its getting weak but its the one my Mother has always used she is 90 will be 91 in April i will get it for her as long as she is still around IF I CAN =) thanks
1,Old parfume,This was old. It had a terrible odor and was not wearable. I was very disappointed. Don't buy this product.
5,Mother-in-law's favorite powder,This is a regular purchase for my mother-in-law. She prefers this power over all others. So what else can I say!
1,huge disappointment,"I loved Blue Grass as a young woman and was happy to see it available through Amazon.My order arrived today and I am hugely disappointed in the product. I was quick to apply the fragrance and quickly disgusted by the odor it had. Nothing like the fragrance I remembered. Nothing I would ever elect to wear....ever. In addition, I now realize I cannot return this bottle of offensive odor for a refund. My bad. I did not read the ""not returnable, not refundable"" warning when I ordered. So, I now will be tossing $16.34 into the trash. A lesson for me to pay closer attention in hte future."
1,SMELLS LIKE A RUBBER TIRE TO ME!,I WAS NOT REAL HAPPY ABOUT THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF! EKKKKK SMELLS JUST LIKE A RUBBER TIRE. IM SURE SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT BUT NOT ME!!!!
1,Misleading cover/title,This was not at all what I was expecting. The girl isn't even the main character; nobody cares about the dad. RIPOFF.
1,"Woah, Cover Fail!",I know it's an older title... but I think maybe a cover re-do is in order. I bet it sells books though.
5,even better than Roger Ebert,"I too find it deplorable that this is out of print. Besides many well-chosen words (who besides Perelman and the late Robertson Davies uses ""tohubohu,"" a word from the Hebrew Bible that sounds exactly like what it means?), this book has several movie reviews that made me amoeboid with laughter. ""The Wickedest Woman in Larchmont""--a review of the movied that gave the world the phrase ""Kiss me, my fool""--is itself worth the price of the entire volume (to use a cliche, which Perelman would never do except to make it hilarious).(""Tohubohu,"" by the way, is a ruckus; it's in Genesis, where the newly created earth is described as formless and void.)"
4,Step Work Out,"I like the tape because I'm a beginner of the step, and happy that Dennis is showing the correct way to step up and down, etc. Here's to a good workout on the step!"
2,Run over by a reindeer,"And lo, within the bluegrass music, thou shalt not play unto thee of any tom-tom, or snare drum, or bass drum, or cymbal, or yea, even hi-hat, which is an abomination unto the bluegrass, thus saith the Spirit of Monroe, for in the day that thou playest it, thou shalt surely die; instead shalt thou take upon thee the mantle of rhythm studies, and thou shalt learn thee how to make rhythm upon thy bass, and thy banjo, and thy guitar, and thy dobro, and thy mandolin, and yea, even thy fiddle; thus shalt thou render superfluous all use of heathen percussion instruments, and things that go bump in the night, saith the Spirit; then shall thy bluegrass be acceptable in mine ears."
5,Extremely Hard to Find!,"An exact reprint of the same manual used by the Drug Enforcement Administration to train its narcotics investigators. This extremely hard to find volume details every possible angle involved with drug law enforcement. Learn all about interviews and interrogations, case preparation, testifying in court, informants, surveillance operations, undercover operations, raids, clandestine laboratories, raid and surveillance equipment and much more. The sections on use of informants and preparation for court testimony are especially enlightening."
5,It's okay.,"Industrial's growing kind of stale these days. :w: is simply churning out a new album once a year like clockwork, the club kids seem down with this Combichrist crap that's just four repeated measures for 6 minutes with a few cuss words tossed in, and good God it's all so tedious.That's what made this such a great find. Sure, it's EBM, and sure, you've got all of the WWII-era samples you'd expect since '95, and sure, it sounds a lot like other beats you've heard before, but the despair sets it apart. I never realized the firebombing of Dresden would make for such a great track. Driving and suited for long, flat stretches of highway, the album just keeps grinding down with the loss and defeat faced by all in war. I love it. Absolutely adore it. One of my favorite albums of the past few years.For fans of: Funker Vogt, later Evil's Toy, tanks."
5,Read this and protect yourself. Common sense isn't enough.,"This book is so scary it should be in the horror section. I never considered the possibility of being falsely accused of abusing a child, but these brief case histories clearly show it happens all too often. The 13 incidents are well written and the point comes across very well. . . there needs to be some major reforms in our justice system to protect teachers (and coaches and child care workers) from having their lives ruined by blatently false accusations of abuse from angry or vindictive students, parents or co-workers.Although the authors offer some good suggestions on what you can do to protect yourself, I wanted more. But I guess that is the point of the book, something more needs to be done to protect the innocent when they are falsely accused. Read this book and pass it on."
5,Very important book,"My husband is currently serving six years in prison because of false accusations. He was an amazing teacher and it is sad that because we could not afford proper representation our children are now growing up without their daddy...and yet another caring, dedicated teacher is gone from the classroom."
5,"Teachers, Read this!",If you are a teacher then you should read this book. Many of us are naive and think nothing bad will ever happen to us. This book is easy to read and tells the stories of teachers who thought the same way but ended up in legal trouble. This book will help educate teachers on how they may protect themselves against false accusations. A must read for teachers.
5,Simply Amazing!,"I heard a track from this album on Pandora and was taken away by it. I immediately looked up the album, previewed the songs and purchased the CD. I must say that this CD is by far, one of the most beautiful collections of songs that I have ever heard on one CD. Thank you Brian for a wonderful, inspirational, peaceful listening experience."
2,Muzak to snore at,"I heard this on Pandora and made the mistake of ordering it on Amazon. This CD is a total snooze fest. New Age pablum of the worst kind...Save your money, or buy my copy used!"
1,new age mental mush,"WARNING for those who think this has something to do with the symphony or with music, it is just static new age mental mush. There is an apparent attempt to associate the works with the classical symphony, but they are totally lacking in the elements of contrast and complexity. The symphony entails much more than nice melodic themes that are played repetitively without melodic development, lacking much harmonic development, relatively little dynamic changes, and almost no color alterations. Those who like Yanni can enjoy the work; those who want something with substance should avoid."
2,under armour soccer socks,"I bought this product for son the first time he put them on the ripped. He was so disappointed , because he was very excited about them ."
2,For completists only,"Contains two songs that are classic Ramones ('Mama's Boy' and 'Too Tough To Die'). The rest is either overproduced misfires ('Chasing The Night') or attempts at pop commercialism ('Howling at the Moon', 'Daytime Dilemma'). You may wish to annoy your uptight friends by playing Dee-Dee's 'Wart Hog' at maximum volume."
3,decent,"I basically got this because of DeeDee doing vocals on some songs... those songs are great, and i like thats theres some solos in some of the songs. but a lot of the songs sound like filler to me. Danger Zone is amazing and so is Wart Hog. and if youre looking for a book about the ramones i highly recomend reading Labotomy: Surviving the Ramones written by DeeDee, its a pretty good read."
1,punk by numbers,"i love the ramones, but this lacks everything that made their first three albums so amazing. the humours gone and it sounds like a band playing by numbers, there is no flash of inspiration here. ive read that johnny saw being in the band as ""a job"" and this comes across on the album. no wonder dee dee couldnt wait to leave. this album lacks all the joy of their early work. the style is that of an unimaginative metal band made up of sessions musicians simply churning out another album for the sake of it. if you love rocket to russia, ramones and leave home, this album will bitterly dissapoint you."
1,not one of their best!,even if youre a fan this album is a bit of a let down. its miles away rocket to russia which is fantastic. very poor.
1,dissapointing,"great cover, but unfortunately thats the only good thing i can say about it. a great band but by this stage well past their sell by date."
5,Best 80's Ramones,"Ramones were always my favorite punk band growing up. The first 3 are classic albums from ICONS ...songs are fast, ugly and timeless.. still stand up. They had a few soft albums in the 80's , but ""TOO TOUGH TO DIE"" is old school. Main attraction in a freak side show!! Joey Ramone shouts out loud and still angry. Guitar riffs and prodctuion are great and DEE DEE sings some serious Punk Rock anthems. Had this one vinyl and love he reissue w/ killer BONUS tracks to enjoy."
5,My favorite Ramones album,"When I was a Freshman in high school and you happened to buy my history book used, you would have had all of the lyrics to all of the songs off of ""Too Tough To Die"" as I wrote them all over that book. An awesome Ramones album!!!"
4,a good one alright,"this is another one of my favorite ramones albums...it's also their most aggressive by a long shot. it's got a neo-hardcore feel, although the songs aren't nearly fast enough. dee dee gives us two of his best songs here with 'wart hog' and 'endless vacation.' both are two of my favorite ramones songs as well. 'chasing the night' and 'howling at the moon' have a new wave feel (maybe it's the keyboards) but are great nonetheless. the only songs i don't like on here are 'no go' and 'planet earth 1988.' 'i'm not afraid of life' is fairly mediocre too. recommended nonetheless."
3,Wrong book shipped under this ISBN number,"0028283163 - I ordered the Glencoe Science: Intor to Life, Earth, and physical Science 1999 and received another book:Glencoe Life Science a totally different book that was listed under the used and new section for this book. Please review carefully what is being ordered. The seller was very accomodating though and I appreciate all her help. I beleive AMazon listed it wrong."
5,Eccentric and brilliant,"The Eels bizarre and indescribable sound is definitely an acquired taste, but ""Daisies of the Galaxy"" is proof that it's a taste worth acquiring. Even if you've heard the samples and hate them, I'd still recommend buying this album. I can't explain why, exactly, but after a few listens I guarantee you'll believe you got your money's worth."
4,A Daisy through Concrete,"On their 3rd album the Eels (pretty much a solo project for you know who), walk a fine balance between pop song perfection and sonic psunspots (that's an obscure reference to an album by another great rock band that makes very similiar music). The sharp songwriting on the title track and Grace Kelly Blues alternate with the loopy sounds from tunes like Flyswatter.A terrific album well worth owning and for anyone who gives a damn about great songwriting."
5,Freakishly Beautiful Pop.,"i love E, and everything he's ever done. This album is much more upbeat than the previous, and for good reason. But all of them are good. This is the one i listen to most. Take my word for it: this is the best mellow-pseudo-indie-art-pop album in the world."
3,Is it kitsch? Is it easy listening?,"Is it kitsch? I read this review in a news magazine. Is it easy listening? but i like it! maybe i am a too old. I don't know if there is a market for this cd... Maybe this cd is a lot of trash, but it is easy. It was better electro-shock blues."
2,acoustic cheese,"I hate to stand out as a sore thumb, but this album sounds more like E's solo albums than the first 2 Eels albums. This album cannot compare musically, lyrically, or emotionally to those first two Eels albums. the music is sparse, mostly using acoustic guitars, and the lyrics are pretty straightforward and bad. Souljacker (the new album) is a huge return to form though -check it out."
1,Its not right,I have heard the eels music before and it is amazing and I dont think that anyone should change it just because some people dont like curse words.
5,Music that means something...,"While The Eels may not be everyone's cup of tea, I am very happy that E keeps plugging away and producing such fine music.I have been a fan of E's work since his two solo albums, and I think each Eels album is better than the last one. Yes, Electro-shock Blues was downright depressing (with a ray of hope at the end), but this music touches you with it's personal tone and it's quirky arrangements.What amazes me about these songs is how they sound so deceptively simple the first time you listen to them, but each new listen reveals more details of production that show what a true craftsman E is. Like his earlier work, the songs contain looped chorus vocals, toy instruments and background noises... and it's just as intriguing as ever.Do I recommend this CD? Hell, yes. The Eels are a ray of light in this day of predictable commercialism."
5,BEAUTIFUL!,"The picture does not even do it justice. I installed mine today and it looks great, what a great buy! Easy to install, only hard part was getting my old yucky one out."
2,disappointment with the product description,"I am merely writing an expression of disappointment because I was interested in this CD based on the title of it. However, none of the other songs are listed.I am trying to purchase music and a radio for a pastor in Africa who has had a stroke and cannot speak. He's stuck all day in a dark room, in bed, and I am trying to select old songs that I'm sure a man from my era out there would know.It's more enjoyable to sing along in your mind to songs you already know, and I know he would know Onward Christian Soldiers, but have no idea what else would be on this CD.That's my humble complaint and disappointment."
4,This Chabrier fellow was good!,"Would definitely buy again. A really nice performance of some excellent pieces. I knew Espana was great but was surprised that I preferred the opera pieces. Docked one star because the slower pieces like the Lamentoso drag on too long, and the liner notes are not very informative. But for the low price, it is definitely worth it to have this CD of some excellent red-blooded Romantic Era classics. Chabrier strikes me as kind of a Theodore Roosevelt macho type. The sound quality is excellent with a big, rich full sound."
1,Stud Earrings,I'm not too happy with these earrings. I wore them for about half a day and one of the stones fell out. So I would say the aren't made well.
5,Earrings,"I bought these earrings for my cartilage piercings, and I love them! They're small, but noticeable and match anything. Very happy with this purchase!"
3,Earrings,"These earrings are really cute, but I thought that they'd be bigger in size.. When I got them, I was really disappointed. They are really small.. :/ But they're still cute.. Not much of an attention grabber."
2,Buy strobes instead,"These lights produce nice daylight balanced light. However, they are VERY dim even with all five bulbs on. This means that even with an ISO of 400, F4.0 and 1/30, you will still get somewhat underexposed, blurry images if you are photographing people. Additionally, the stem for the stand is not balanced on the head. This means that they are very unwieldy and hard to tip up and down. You can get strobes for much less money and they will give you much more versatility. I really wanted to like these lights and am very disappointed in their performance. I really don't understand why they are more expensive than strobes. One would think that the lack of mechanics needed for such a light would keep the cost down."
1,Love VNV But Hate This DVD.,"I practically like every track they have ever recorded. They are a great electronic act but plain and simple concert DVDs rarely work. I was hopeing Pastperfect would be a collection of the super cool video montages they used during their recent tours. I distinctly recall the one produced for the song ""Carbon"" which powerfully demonstrated the effects of green houses gases on the planet and the destruction of the rain forest.I would rather see visual art than a bunch of screaming idiots and strobe lights."
4,almost but not quite.,"This DVD includes several songs filmed at three locations. If you've already seen VNV in concert then this dvd will do little more than refresh your memory. If however you've never seen them in concert it will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect. Overall If you already have live mp3's of vnv, or you've been to a concert you've probably already heard these versions so it won't be anything new. I own quite a few concert DVD's from various bands from Tori Amos to Rammstein and this is far from the best one I own.The sound quality of this DVD is excellent, the editing is average and cuts seem to be frequent and pointless. The dvd fails to capture the full energy you'd actually feel at a live concert, and only partially captures the performance of the band.If you're a fan of VNV then this is probably worth the investment, unless they happen to be coming to your area in concert."
5,Simply the best EBM/Industrial/Electro DVD to date,"Finally, after being delayed many many times it has finally arrived and I am pleased to say the wait has been worth it.VNV nations first DVD is awesome and a must have for any fan of ebm, synth, electro, industrial type music.The picture quality on the concert footage disc (DVD 1) is superb and the audio quality is excellent. DVD 2 is packed with interviews and footage from various stops on the futureperfect tour and is both entertaining and amusing.If you have never seen VNV Nation perform live and want to see what it's all about, get this DVD and enjoy.This review is of the special edition which features 2 DVD disks and a CD Rom containing videos, poster and sticker. A very nice package which is worth the price."
4,Quick sale,"Book arrived promptly in time for me to start my class. Quick, easy, sale! Would buy again."
5,Earth and Ashes was heavenly,The book was beautifully covered and in perfect condition.The story was mystical and unlike anything else I have read about Afghanistan.
2,Don't Bother,"This short book was boring, plain and simple. I finished reading this book because I thought it had to get better, it didn't."
5,Earth and Ashes,Have not had a chance to read the book yet..but it arrived in great condition and early!
1,unbelievable,"This book is mildly interesting as fiction but bears little or no resemblance to fact. One question: Why does someone who makes a living as a writer have to use a ghost writer for his ""autobiography?"" Don't waste your money on this."
4,Expanding Descent,"Well this is the first expansion for Descent, and let me say that it adds value to the original.There are new heroes, new abilities, and overall just increases the difficulty of the game.If you are wanting to look for expansions, I believe this is the best one to START at, as it adds in a little bit to get use to, then pick up Road To Legend, if you can find it, that one increases the gameplay immensely!The quality is great of course, The only problem I have with any of the descents, is there is NEVER enough room to put everything. I have had to purchase bags to combine them all, which now all sit in the base game, and the pieces are in there as well, this box is left only for the monsters, which isn't a big deal, I just wish they thought that all through before they did all this.... minor thing."
5,Truly Sublime!!!,"Aeoliah is a truly gifted and insightful musician as well as a very talented artist. His art graces the cover of this CD which is very fitting for the truly inspiring music inside. The music just takes you away and transforms the space that you are in into something other worldly. This music is great for relaxation, meditation, yoga, and Reiki. I play it in my house and the music brings a sense of peace, joy, tranquility and presence into the environment. This is one of my favorite CD's. Truly music of the angels. If you love new age music and especially instrumental, I highly recommend this CD."
5,Great for Massage,I am a massage therapist and I love this CD. One client commented about how much they like this cd
2,Not worth it.,"8 dollars for 96 pages and three short stories? C'mon, guys! ...and only one of the three stories was at all satisfying. The first (Skeeve) story didn't need Skeeve to be there. The last (Aazh) Story didn't have a satisfactory ending - it was almost like the first chapter in a much longer story, rather than being complete. Only the one in the middle (Chumly, Tananda, and Guido) had not only a good plot, but tied the ends up. If I wasn't a completist, this would have been a waste of money, and as it was it was about 5 dollars more than it's worth."
3,Still not as good as the rest of the series,"As a collection of short stories goes, this one is more true to the characters Aspirin has created over the years, but it still lacks the charm of the original books. I can't put my finger on why. As I stated in my last review, however, in Class Dis-Mythed the authors finally start to get back in the zone, so definitly give that one a try."
5,M.Y.T.H.,How can you go wrong reading these tales. I started reading them years ago and the bookstore I got them from closed and I never got to read all of them. So glad I found them here. Will have to get all of the ones I have missed reading.
1,Terrible - I'm Done,This series used to be lots of fun. But the last few books have been TERRIBLE. I'm done.
4,Closer to the Originals,"They're still not quite as good as the earlier ""Myth"" books. There was an undercurrent of satire that they haven't gotten back yet. The stories are still entertaining and original."
5,The Villa,"The villa was a very nice love story that had alot of family in it and took place in the USA and in Italy. It had good and bad family. Romance, that was well done. ( As usual for Nora Roberts) I recomend this book for folks that like excitement and suspence. The business part is interesting as well."
5,Wonderful Vistas,"Great pictures. Although the author wrote it to help others get great pictures, I will never get back to Yosemite and these picture are wonderful for my memories."
2,only good for mediocre snapshots,"I agree with other reviewers, that this book is good only for getting ""snapshots"", not really good photographs. If you want stunning photos, even from a compact camera or superzoom, check out Frye's book on the same topic."
5,PhotoSecrets Yosemite Review,Nice book. Very informative with very detailed instructions of where and how to take some awesome photos.
1,Not worth it,"I think this book is just not worth being a ""photo book"". Firstof all, the pictures in the book are not at all impressive. Theprint paper quality is quite sub-standard. I didnt expecta book from a ""photo publishing house"" to be of such a lowquality. I will not buy another photosecrets book everagain. I am going to try out Michael Frye's book instead.someone wants to buy this one from me :)"
1,Not for Serious Photographers!,"I was greatly disappointed by the book and immediately returned it. This book contains ONLY so-called ""drive-by shootings"" - it's obvious this author made little efforts to capture the best lights or composition. These ""snapshots"" were mostly taken in the mid-day sun, when almost all advanced photographers avoid taking pictures. This book is probably intended for tourists on a bus-tour, but not for serious photographers.If you have money to waste on this book, buy two copies of ""The Photographer's Guide to Yosemite"" by Michael Frye. The latter book is truly a work of art and I was deeply inspired by every image in it. It's hard to believe these two books - on the other extremes - are priced about the same."
4,USS Lionfish model,"This model kit was fun and fairly easy to build... a little lite on detail, but if you really wanted to spiff it up, you can get some aftermarket detail kits!Everything fit together well with the one exception I had noted others having... the front dive plains are a bit of a tight fit... solved this by cutting a piece of the parts tree down as a spacer, and glued it in place inside to narrow the mounting point just a little! was an easy fix... just made the cross-beam slightly smaller, then glue'd it to one side just behind where dive plain peg fits... waited 24hrs, glued other side of peg in place, rapped some tape around that point on the hull to hold it narrowed and after dried... All fits well!!!Over all, a fun, nice looking model! with nice molded details, simple to build for any modeler with even moderate experience!"
4,Great starter sub model.,"This is a basic plastic model, with 40 pieces of 30 distinct types. Assembly is straightforward. 1:180 scale is fairly large, so even inexperienced model builders can still easily handle all the pieces. Fit and finish is not the best but still acceptable at this price. My seven-year-old and I had an enjoyable afternoon working on it together.USS Lionfish is now a museum ship in Massachusetts. We plan to visit it someday.The biggest downside is its fragility. Young boys may treat it like just another toy and subject it to too great a force. Most broken pieces can be put back with crazy-glue, but the movable parts present real challenges. I had the hardest time with the dive-plane, which came with a shaft that was 1mm too short to begin with. The dive-plane rubs against the hull, making it both easy to break and hard to fix."
1,Made by cheap plastic,I bought this toy for a Christmas gift. When I opened the box and then I realized the toy is made by very cheap plastic. It doesn't look fun at all when you build a toy ship like that. Don't understand why other reviewers give 5 stars.
4,Helpful,"Troubleshooting and servicing heat pumps was very helpful, in that it was not written in techincal lingo, that a student or beginner would be come overwhelmed by and give up. It does explain the many different aspects of heatpumps and deals with different variations and operations. There are many good diagrams to show how items work. The thing I found lacking was step by step troubleshooting diagrams."
3,Its okay,This book does a good job of talking about some of the basic aspects of heat pumps and there operations. Some of the illustrations are done very well to give you the insides of a basic reversing valve. However some of the information on there was old and being in new installation this didn't help me much but if I were doing retrofits on old systems it may be of more use. Overall a decent book.
4,I liked it,"This movie got a lot of bad reviews, but I liked it just to watch Jeremy Renner when he was so young. Great love scene was a plus!!"
4,fun sword,"I bought this sword because it reminded me of my childhood and I wanted to pass that along to my brother's kids. Yes, I'm the uncle that buy's toy weapons for himself to play with while horsing around with the nieces; but at least I play nice."
5,Winter Was Never This Hot,"Johnny Winter deserves his place in the pantheon occupied by Hendrix, Clapton, McLaughlin, Reinhardt and now I'm running out. This is Texas electric blues at its best.The original LP was an instant classic, and this compilation actually improves on it with studio cuts and live tracks. Studio: Early In The Morning and Tell The Truth, both outstanding. Live cuts: 1-6 are all excellent, especially Mean Town Blues which is nothing short of dazzling.After that, tragedy strikes as brother Edgar steps forward to sour the milk. His singing resembles nothing more closely than a horrifying Ella Fitzgerald impression. However, by then it is too late for these missteps to spoil what is definitely a house-burning, rip-it-up rock/blues masterpiece. Check out Memory Pain."
5,This is a great old album of Jonny Winters.,"For thoes who like Kenny Wayne Shepared,you have to love this. I am not to sure but this album has to be 20-25 years old. This guy came way before SRV and one of the best in Texas. Listen to this and figure out for yourself who took the licks from whom."
3,HOLD ON A SECOND...,"Second Winter is an excellent studio disc, and if I were just reviewing that, I'd give it five stars. The Albert Hall concert has its moments, but to compare it to the Allman Bros. ""Live at the Fillmore"" as a previous reviewer did is blasphemous. Johnny's guitar playing and singing are first rate as always, and Tommy Shannon was a rock solid bass player, but I'm subtracting two full stars for the presence of Brother Edgar on this record. If I never hear him sing ""Tobacco Road"" again, it will be too soon, let me tell you."
4,Vintage Winter,"I enjoyed listening to the album since I lost the original years ago due to high water in the home. Nostalgic I guess one could say. Definately some of the tracks were just ""filler"" but there are some really good licks on this recording."
4,Johnny at his best,"Had this in the original vinyl and it was a double album with only three sides of music, that's right, one side just smooth, no music. If your thinking of getting this, one of Johnny's best, get the deluxe edition with the second CD of live music from a performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1970. Not much more $, and a killer live show."
3,"Great guitar, but ...","I really dig Johnny's guitar playing. There is no doubt he is a Great. However, I find this release a little lacking in the song department. Most of these tunes are pretty weak, and I don't think too much of the production quality, either. But this is a hard-rocking album, and Winter does play some blistering guitar throughout. I think if you look at this as a ""record"" of Johnny's style and are the type who can enjoy focusing on a guitar player and his passions, then this might be an cd you want to pick up. I will recommend Johnny's ""Still Alive & Well"" over this release. I have to mention that when I dramatically thinned out my cd collection years ago, ""Second Winter"" was a disk I held onto, and I guess that speaks something for it."
4,"A ""Blues"" Novel, A Stunning Debut","I read the book after I'd already gone through The Healing and it made me understand why her debut astonished the literary community. She created a deep bluesy world in which to explore themes of love, geneology, black matriarchy, memory, forgiveness, loyalty...One wishes she could have told more stories, had a career trajectory like Morrison's but her personal life did not accomodate her gift. Ursa Corregidora is a beautiful blues singer in 1930's middle America. A tragic accident (or is it?) leaves her unable to bear children and tormented by the twisted lineage of a line of women that will end with her. I would recommend the book for anyone interested in women's fiction, black historical fiction, American fiction. Similar theme to Beloved but much more spare prose style, much is left for the reader to infer, improvise. A slim, powerful book."
4,Worked for Me,"Corregidora is a wild ride into the sordid clash of race, identity, bi-raciality, multi-culturalism and self acceptance. I read it when I was very young and its effect still resonates. Gayl Jones is a master of the surreal and Corregidora as well as Eva's Man are must read classics. Her style reminds me of Djuna Barnes, and like Barnes, it is not an easy read, but a worthy one."
5,lowepro gloves,I really think most photograpers should have this product in thier bag. Not only for those cold morning but when you have to carry a cold tripod around all day.yes you can operate your camera with these on.
5,Banging CD,"I sat one day at work listening to a station where you can input your favorite artist and the station will play that artist as well as other artists who have a similar style of music you select. I input Musiq Soul Child because he too is one of my favorite artist...However, throughout the course of the day I heard this song about two or three times...Tell Me Why...Dave Hollister...First, the arrangements were awesome and the vocals blew me away...Dave you have a fan forever. I have even gone back to review other CD's that he has out. Thus far, no disappointed with any of his music...Blow them away DAVE!"
3,"Dave has a great voice, but bad material","I love Dave Hollister's voice, but this CD is full of wrong songs, that not even Dave's great voice can pull off. I'm still rooting for Dave and his camp to get the right fit. Good Luck!"
5,Dave Hollister still has it....,"After buying Chicago 85: The Movie.. i didn't Dave could comeback with a stronger CD.. but i ended up listening and buying ""Things In The Game Done Changed""... i was wrong.. With the lead single ""Baby Do Those Things"" Dave will give the critics something to think about when it comes to Dave Hollister.. My current favorite is the song ""It's Okay"".. that song has a nice beat and I think it should be the next single.. Still to this day Dave Hollister has to be the most UNDER-RATED artist ever... he is very talented and he really doesn't get any credit for it.. If this album doesn't go Platinum I will be upset.. Dave Hollister thank you for making another Classic album..Notable Tracks:It's Okay (My Favorite)Baby Do Those ThingsLove Hate RelationshipFor YouI'm WrongKeep Lovin' You (Remix)What's A Man To DoBad Tracks:NONE"
3,Average,"Theres nothing great about this album, nor is there anything too bad about it. This is the only REAL Nirvana album that gets below four stars (NIRVANA and WISHKAH are NOT REAL Nirvana albums). I do like this and yes, I am a die-hard. I dont love this even though I will listen to this once in a while. Its just okay, songs like 'Aneurysm' and 'D-7' are great, but songs like 'Molly's Lips' and 'Turnaround' are not. People, this is just okay."
2,Not Worth It,"i think i dissed amazon.com in my last review , maybe they'llpost this one. The songs are: 1. Aneyerism (From Incesticide)2. Turnaround (From Incesticide) 3. D7 (One of the best Nirvana songs, but not worth almost forty dollars with S+H) 4. Molly's Lips (From Incesticide) 5. Son of a Gun (From Incesticide) 6. Even in His Youth (You can get it on the teen spirit single)The Nirvana box set (not singles collection) will probably be out in 3 or 4 months, and will probably include all these songs. Wait for that. If you don't own Incesticide yet, buy that. It's a way better b-sides collection. It's less than half the price of this and there are 15 songs instead of 6.And why am I the only one who puts my name in my reviews?"
2,Obsolete...,"Initially I thought the appeal of this EP lay solely with D-7, the remaining tracks being collected on the readily available Incesticide album or the Teen Spirit CD single. Yet from reading some earlier reviews i'm now aware that D-7 also officially appears elsewhere, further diminishing this EP's ranking as a 'necessary purchase'. Therefore, this EP is really only for the Nirvana completest. Yet the tracks are nonetheless solid. The Peel tracks (1,3,4) aren't original Cobain songs but nevertheless are upbeat and great fun. The Aneurysm included here is different to the version included on Incesticide (and arguably better). An Australian version was also released to coincided with Nirvana's one and only tour of Australia. Although featuring exactly the same track-listing, the OZ release has a much prettier picture of the band on the cover.2 stars, because of the complete overlap with other official Nirvana releases."
5,Strike a Pose!,"Dr.Romanov's book is based on injury-free running.The Pose Method will take running into the 21st century.This is the first book ever to teach running as a skill. The book is easy to read, with lots of illustrations. Any athlete from recreational to elite,marathoner to triathlete,will want to read it.Also,any parent who has a child involved in a running sport,like soccer or basketball will be at a distinct advantage with the information found only in this book.This book is destined to become the definitive book on running.Thanks! Dr.Romanov"
5,The TRUE way for running...!!!!,"I heard about Dr. Romanov's Pose Method a pair of years ago, and I met him last year in CAN, at a Coches Seminar. These was an inflexion point in my Coach life, when I ""discovered"" the true way to run, the only way to learn to run as a skill, not a ""magic"" thing.I have 10 years Coacheing atheltes, and nobody never teached me with this science quality.Dr. Romanov is a great scientist who dedicated a great part of his life to research about running.I forgot ""no pain no gain"" of myself and my athletes life.Running must be a pleasure, a relax moment and a way to be happy doing it.I recommend Pose Method of Running to learn running as a skill.Everybody can do it!!!!!!!Thank you Dr. Romanov to improve running world...!!!Prof. Enrique BollanaBuenos AiresARGENTINA"
2,"Pose Tech works, the book could be much shorter and better","I am a 36 years old recreational runner/marathoner. I found out about Pose method by accident browsing the net some time ago. I stumbled upon Mr. Romanov's website, and was quite impressed by the promise of injury free running.After buying/reading the book I have to say, that it is poorly written, full of typos, and the first 100 pages or so are there only to sell the Pose method, which is beyond the point really, as I already bought an expensive paperback. I guess it could be condensed into 20 pages max.Having said that, the book made me think, and the method works. Yes, there is a real increase in speed and cadence without much perceived effort, however there must be strength training and stretching that goes with it should I want to switch 100% to pose method.To sum it up - it should be a very expensive brochure rather than a book full of filler material. Thats a letdown. BUT IT WORKS. I would recommend this book to a friend.Frank, Latvia"
3,useful,an interesting book with just few key concepts of proper running and it works!..the rest of the book are redundancy..
5,WONDERFUL AND WELL-WRITTEN,"This is a wonderful and well-written book on herbal magic, folklore, and natural healing with herbs. It makes an excellent companion to the author's other herbal, ""The Wicca Garden."" If you are into magical herbalism (and what self-respecting Witch isn't?) you will certainly find a ton of valuable and useful occult information in both of these Dunwich books."
1,Cunningham + Folklore = Not Great.,"This book cited Scott Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Herbs entirely too much. Dunwich also got several facts wrong, such as saying that Foxglove is the same thing as Nightshade. MOST of the herbal formulas in this book are of the ""put it under your pillow and dream of your true love"" variety. I cannot recommend it to anyone."
4,Interesting,An interesting book that gives a vivid picture of women's conditions in the 50es. Perhaps on the verge of soap but still exiting and page turning - I read it in three days. Therefore I recommend it to anyone who wants a really goodand enjoyable reading experience.
5,Can't believe it was written in the 50s!,"This was definitely a page turner! I constantly had to remind myself that this was actually WRITTEN in the 1950's. Ive always had a stereotype of the women at that time as being prudish. But this book proved that theory as totally wrong. I was fascinated by each girl's story and cheered for them (and wanted to punch just about every man that interacted with them). The ending was NOT what i expected, but its nice to not be able to predict every book you read. A great summer read!"
3,ok but boring at times,"This book was somewhat like Sex in the City, which I dont watch. A few parts were interesting but seemed to drag on too long."
1,Jaffe's worst novel,"Sometimes first novels are mediocre which for me is the case with ""The Best of Everything"". I tried to read it 3 times over the past 30+ years, but only finished reading it the first time. My favorite Jaffe novels are ""Class Reunion"", ""After the Reunion"" and ""The Last Chance"" all of which are compelling from the first to the last page (and what great movie plots would they have made!).However I was always wondering how a boring book like ""The Best of Everything"" could become such a good movie.I'm amazed that this book got an average of 4 stars on amazon.com and I wonder if I really read the same book?If you want to read a compelling novel about the fities, try ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"" by Sloan Wilson which is often mentioned in reviews of the TV series ""Mad Men"".My favorite Wilson novel is ""A Summer Place"" (both Sloan Wilson novels have been filmed, have beautiful movie locations, great soundtracks and are wonderful to watch!)."
1,over charging!,"I am so excited to read this on my kindle, but will not purchase it so long as the kindle edition is more expensive than the paperback edition. This book is over 50 years old; there is absolutely no reason to be charging $12 a copy. Will be happy to update my review once the price drops and I've read it."
1,disappointed,this product is getting returned right now due to a defect. amazon did nothing for me with regards to my problem and toshiba took weeks to get things straight. now they are coming to pick up my tv because i was given the ultimadum of a refurb or a refund. i chose the refund. tomorrow is the 19th of september and i purchase the tv on the 19th of august. i never got to watch a program on my tv and i will be glad to be done with the whole situation.
5,good quality/great price,a very nice quality leather case for an excellent price ! my kodack easy share v1003 fits in it perfectly.
4,NAVY FROM HELL,"THIS IS AGAIN A PRETTY DECENT BOOK FROM THE DEATHLANDS SERIES.AS A FAN I ALWAYS ENJOY WHEN THE GROUP RETURNS TO A REDOUBT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TO BEFORE,IN THIS CASE THE ONE IN FLORIDA FROM ""DARK CARNIVAL"".FROM THERE THEY ARE ON FOOT AND THEN ON THE SEA TO TRY TO FIND ANOTHER MAT TRANS UNIT IN BETTER CONDITION.ALONG THE WAY THERE IS A GREAT ENCOUNTER IN A RESTAURANT WHERE AXLER SHOWS YOU HE CAN MAKE YOUR MOUH WATER OR YOUR STOMACH CHURN IN DESCRIBING DEATHLAND MEALS,IN THIS CASE THE LATTER.MILDRED WARNING DOC ABOUT THE PECAN LOG IS GREAT.ANOTHER PART OF THE STORY I ENJOY IS ONE OF THE FEW TIMES THEY ENCOUNTER A MUTANT BREED THAT IS ACTUALLY FREINDLY AND HELPFUL.INTHIS CASE THE DWELLERS.IT WAS A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM STICKIES AND SUCH.THEIR ADVERSARY ADMIRAL POSEIDON ,A MAD CAPT. NEMO TYPE DOES A GOOD JOB AND FORCES KRYSTY WROTH TO BRING ON HER EARTH MOTHER POWERS WHICH IS ALWAYS AN EVENT.ALL IN ALL, NOT A BAD CHAPTER IN THEIR SAGA."
4,Straightforward,These combined CO/smoke detectors install and set up very easily. Let's hope there will never be an opportunity to comment on their function.My only complaint is the blister pack was harder to open than most.
1,"Absolute crap, false alarms","Bought these because i have a 4 story house and wanted the feature of the alarms being linked. Like the other reviews said, they are prone to false alarms. I would stay this all worked well for a year or two. But ever since then these things go off all the time. I have replaced so many batteries I cannot even count. DO NOT BUY this system"
2,$60 Product is Worthless After Only 5 Years,"Bought 7 of these for my household....quite an investment in technology. When I recieve them, I notice on the packaging that there is an end of life cycle alarm that sounds after 5 years due to code rules on the CO alarm portion.I'm not spending that kind of money on a system that is worthless in 5 years. I asked the techs if you could just replace the out-of-life CO sensor and they said no. What a waste of a perfectly good product to have to throw it out. Returning all 7 of mine. Looks like the technology isn't quite there yet."
4,setup is quick,"Bought 3 units,1 each floor. They are REALLY loud and sound off in sequence. You only have 2 minutes to setup secondary units so you need to do it before you install it.My only real complaint is that they don't have a location that refers to which floor its on (basement being the exception). EX: The apartment upstairs is set to ""hallway"" instead of saying ""second floor"""
5,Excellent product and easy to use. Only one caution is to make sure you order the correct part,Excellent product but I made a mistake and ordered the smoke detector that is not programmed. I like getting the fire location with the smoke detector. Very cheap to operate using 2 AA bateries.
1,waste of time and money,"I installed two of these. In less than a year, both had failed. Amazon replaced the first one and it continues to function for now. The second failed too late to be returned. Failure mode: The CO alarm reports high ppm when there is none."
1,Junk,"Eats batteries for breakfast, false alarms more frequently as they age. Reports smoke when there is none. Good reviews are not worth trusting. Don't buy!"
1,They don't communicate between floors!,"These alerts were placed on the three floors of my home. They would not communicate with each other unless they were in line of sight- not much help if you want them on separate floors. Calling the ""help"" line got you on hold, listening to the same inane message every 12 seconds. The tech support person said if they worked in the same room, the problem was interference in the house! Interference apparently means the floor between the devices, since they were practically on top of one another.I did get them to work by putting all three next to the staircase in my home. By then I had already drilled into the drywall to attach them.If you need communication between floors, keep looking. These don't work.Don't expect any help from their tech support either."
4,First Alert Wireless - pretty good,I purchased three of these units to replace older units which were not interconnected. I unpacked all units and sat them on the desk to program. The setup was straight forward except for the part where you select the location. The test button and the location selection button are the same button and I found very diffcult to get to the location selection and ended up testing the unit(s). I would then have to remove the batteries and start the process again. I would say that it took me 4-6 tries on each unit to get the location set to the correct value. I have tested once installed and they all sound and announce correctly so I'm hopeful that they will be a good product for a while to come
3,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the range of the one-link communication. Ten to fifteen feet seems to be the limited range.
5,Wow,"These are possibly the loudest smoke detectors in the entire world. All joking aside, I would recommend using ear plugs when you initially set them up, because they will hurt your ears and possibly make you cry a little bit or a lot. Three of these going off in your home at the same time is pretty unbearable, which is kind of what I look for in a device that tells me to get out of the house.The whole linking together thing is also some amazing ""space age"" technology. So when a CO leak starts in your basement, the detector in your bedroom will also go off any it will even go so far as to tell you the problem is in the basement. At this point you can climb out a window and hope with all your might that the rest of your family gets out safely as well."
1,Units communicate poorly with each other,"After some difficulty in programming three of these they worked properly placed several feet from each other. However, they failed to talk to one another even in direct line of sight when they were more than 30' apart. And so they were useless when one unit was put in the basement and the other two located in upstairs second floor bedrooms. So a cautionary note to the buyer; try them out at once and be prepared to return them promptly if they don't communicate properly in your installation. I waited nearly three months to install them and now I may not be able to return them."
1,NO!!! This thing is waking me up at every 6 weeks for batteries!!,I brought this and now regret it. This thing waking me up in the middle of the night every 6 weeks for batteries!!!
4,Great to connect all detectors together,"In a large house, the First Alert ONELINK feature is very helpful, since, if set up properly, one alarm will being set off will make all detectors ring. It makes a huge noise, and in a three story house (plus a basement for 4 stories to protect in all) it would be very hard to sleep through or ignore a CO or fire alarm.Set up a bit tricky. Make sure you test after setup (and listen to each unit) to make sure they are all connected. The instructions could be a bit better so there is a risk that they are not really connected.Wish they had a duel smoke and fire detector (ionization sensor plus a particulate censor) combined with CO and using the ONELINK feature.Have no experience with actual alarm sounding, and no false alarms, so I only can rate as installed and tested using the test button.I will buy some more units to insure full coverage of the house."
1,Bought 4 - 2 bad - no customer service available,Wanted the features and was willing to pay the price. Bought 4 - they programmed and installed easily. Went to test and 2 activated all 4 and 2 only activated themselves. Reprogrammed with same results.Went to the website - no customer service number. FAQ instructions were not complete (printed instructions were 95% government and lawyer inspired and 5 % useful but that is OK it was easy to install and configure. No customer service number! How can that be?Since these are critical the immediate faults DO NOT inspire confidence I packed them all up and sent them back.THANKS SO MUCH AMAZON for the easy return policy. Hope you bill your costs back to First Alert.Will try the Kidde but bummed they don't have a combo w/CO detection and wireless.
1,Constant false alarms,"I bought six of these and installed them throughout the entire house.These things go off spontaneously, usually at around 5am. Maybe it has to do with dropping temperature or something, as it is pretty consistent that they go off just before dawn.The worst part about this is that now the household just finds the alarm annoying, and nobody gets out of bed. The alarms that cried wolf.I'm going to replace them all"
2,Love the concept - but poor quality and poor wireless performance,"I purchased 4 of these about 6 months ago. Since then 2 have failed and required warranty replacement. Thankfully, First Alert's replacement service was fair and fast. My other complaint is that the wireless performance of these units is poor in my house. Two of the units are separated by about 25 feet, and they constantly have problems ""talking"" to each other. First Alert's recommendation is to buy another and place it in between these two. Yeah right, I'm gonna buy another failure prone device that isn't cheap..."
4,What the?!,"I purchased two of these. Before I purchased, I read reviews and the ones that spooked me out were the claims that these eat batteries. Well, I installed them, (one upstairs and one downstairs), they communicated with no problems, they were easy enough to program, BUT less than one week later the alarms sound... they never said which alarm was triggered... so on closer inspection the upstairs one has a red light indicating ""power"". I'm assuming this simply means that the batteries are nearly dead...SEVERAL WEEKS LATER: The alarms have given me no more problems (and I never had to change any batteries). The alarm sounding for an unknown reason has never happened again, so I'm hoping that the alarms are both operating normally. The test works normally. I'm changing my initial review from 2 stars up to 4 now. It would have been 5 stars, but the odd alarm with no explaination has taken some of my peace-of-mind."
4,"easy install, interconnects but untested",installation was easy. the test feature proves that the interconnected components work together . luckly I have not had a fire or carbon monoxide incident so I can't say for sure that it works .I am hoping to keep it that way
3,Editorial Comments from the Publisher,"Cast: 5M, 9F. Set: Single interior set. Time: About 1 hour. STORY: ""That nasty rogue, Snicklefritz Grubb, is passing himself off as a ""bachelor photographer"" in Central City, Colorado. Grubb hopes to ensnare a rich widow or young heiress. He rents space in the Herb Pharmacy of Miz Cindy, who is known as the ""Angel of the Mining Camps"" because of her nursing skills. Cindy's in love with Darius D. Dogood, the newspaper editor. One day an old miner gives Cindy a huge gold nugget, and Snicklefritz decides he must have it--especially since the gun-totin' Mrs. Clutchpurse is demanding that he pay back money he's borrowed--or else! Snicklefritz decides to force our heroine to be his bride in order to get the nugget. Watching the dirty work is a howl. The complications are non-stop. Wait until you see the wedding scene! Good small roles that require only a few rehearsals. The set is no problem. Your cast and audience will have a great time!"""
5,Love it,All the songs are awesome and a good collection of their best songs! I truly recommend this one! Great buy
3,Excellent but too subtle a difference from regular reissue,"My only gripe is that the quality on this ""remastered"" version sounds almost identical to the original compilation I bought a few years ago on Rhino. If you're buying for the music, it's a great starter set...the remastering, however, is insignificant on this release."
5,Actually this is the Philly Sound!,"Some reviewers refer to this as Motown music when in fact the music on this cd was recorded during the later part of their career when they were based in Philly. The Spinners only had one big hit when they were the Motown Spinners. The move to Philly saw them team up with great song writers in Philly to really create some classic soul music! I'm talking about Tom Bell and Linda Creed. The Philly Sound actually followed Motown and was a 70s thing. It used more sophisticated arrangements and some groups even had the backing of the Phila Orchestra moonlighting musicians! Smooth would be the best way to describe this sound. The Delphonics, Ojays, Blue Magic, Harold Melvin, Teddy and yes the Spinners are all big names from the Philly Sound era! (Only one of the Spinners was actually from Philly. Not sure about the rest.) ... (FYI.. the three big soul cities are Motown (Detroit), Stax (Memphis) and Philadelphia!)"
5,another Gem!!!,I'm a big fan of lone wolf and cub and i already have DVD box set of this. but the blu ray price shows up as $17?!?. Man...i gotta get it!! good shipping time and no problem with it!!
4,lone wolf and cub box set,"enjoy the set agree with a negative review about the transfer to dvd not giving full picture. the choice is no copy or what i have , i will keep the box set unless a restored version comes out at a reasonable price"
5,Hours of entertainment,"If you like samurai flicks with a dark, comedic twist then these are for you. Action, violence, and sweetness all rolled into one."
3,Bait for the hook,"That Blackie Lawless is a tortured soul indeed. This album more or less continues the Crimson Idol theme. Blackie is good at acoustics though, as shown on I Can't and Keep Holding On. Not too many thundering rockers though, the closest being a remake of Queen's Tie Your Mother Down. 3 stars just 'cause it's Blackie."
3,3.5 stars,This album has some songs that i like and some songs that are just ok. Its classic Wasp heavy metal style. If you are new to Wasp check Wasp and Inside the electric circus. But ok i dont know who might not like this album . Its a nice one .
2,"Not awful, but my least favorite from WASP","This is one of the only WASP albums that I don't really like. The bonus tracks are pretty cool--it's nice to hear WASP do a little something different. Then again, how many bands have already covered ""Whole Lotta Rosie""??? They couldn't come up with anything more original?This album was the follow-up to Crimson Idol and reportedly contains a lot of leftover material from those sessions. Take one listen to the first track on Still Not Black Enough and you'll see this is true. It has the SAME drum pattern that is on practically EVERY song on Crimson Idol.The problem with this record is that it has no real spark. It sounds like Blackie just threw together a handful of songs that don't really go together and made an album out of it. I'm sure there are some who dig it, but not me."
4,Can't figure this one out!,"I bought this so called new edition back in 1996,I live in Ireland and that's the version that we got.All of the track listings are the same too...strange.They'll probably remarket the old US version over here and say that it's new !"
5,Great for finding old ethnic recipes,"This is a great cookbook if you like a little history with your recipes. Mainly I am writing this to let people know that Akadine Press went out of business in May, 2006 so if you want a copy and I recommend it, you'll have to go the used book route."
5,A Must-Read for All Parents!,"The best parenting book I've ever read. Filled with detailed examples of how real family members talk and act with one another, and how the particular words we use either improve or sabotage our efforts to discipline. Unlike other books which generalize about child development/behavior, this one suggests specific words and actions to use in a variety of situations. The result is to minimize our children's negative responses, and encourage them to exercise good judgement and take responsibility for their actions. Parents, teachers and caregivers will be filled with a renewed sense of purpose and enthusiasm after reading this book. Buy a copy for yourself and give it as a gift to others -- especially new or expectant parents. You can't get started on the road to happy parenting and family life too early!"
2,A very passive approach...,"I was looking for a book about discipline that helps increase self-confidence rather than undermine it. I picked up this book, which turned out to be not at all practical for parenting my high-spirited and generally well-behaved daughter. The suggested responses to situations are very passive and assume the child gives up very easily. Samalin suggests replacing obviously abusive language (""Pick up that coat this minute! Why are you so sloppy? Didn't you ever hear of a coat hanger?"") with oddly passive-aggressive language (""Coats belong in the closet, not on the floor."") (p. 16). Other conversatons in the book presume that as soon as a child's feelings are acknowledged, all battles will be over. But in my experience, pretending behavior problems don't exist doesn't make them go away, so I found this book to be impractical. If you want to take a direct rather than passive approach to parenting your kids, this is not the book for you."
4,Humbling.,"This makes book makes you stop and think about life and how to live it. You can sit back like most of us do and just exist or you can push to the limits like Roskelley and enjoy some of the greatest personal achievements possible. But this comes at a cost, he's lost friends and climbing partners and I'm sure it's been very difficult on his family relationships. From the sounds of things though, I don't think he would change how his life has turned out. If your thinking about hooking yourself to a rock anytime soon, read this just to make sure you know what your getting into."
5,Cat loves it,"I tried Temptations and my cat was very ""meh"" with those treats. Decided to try this out, and the cat loves them. Will buy again"
2,Should have been far better,"I thoroughly agree with the last reviewer Mr Reed. Hiney's biography contains a significant number of very basic errors in describing the plots of Raymond Chandler's novels and short stories. These are elementary details, and a serious biographer has no excuse for making obvious factual mistakes.I don't think this is a bad book either, but I do question conclusions of anyone who cannot check source material thoroughly.Frank MacShane wrote a biography of Raymond Chandler which I believe is far better than Mr Hiney's work."
3,One can't help but wonder,"Hiney's biography, while illuminating in a number of ways, has one severe problem that undercuts its quality. He makes mistakes, obvious factual ones. When recounting the plot to ""Farewell, My Lovely,"" he is wrong. Other synopses of stories and novels are not quite right, as though he read them in a hurry or not at all.This doesn't mean that Hiney wrote a bad book, but I can't help but wonder. When such easily verifiable facts are incorrect, what can one make of his conclusions based off of other, now suspect, facts?This is a good book and a useful window into Chandler's life, but when the most elemental literary analysis of the man's work is off, and badly, one can't hold it in too high esteem.One can only hope that a better biography of Chandler comes along."
2,Printing Errors,I purchased one copy of this book and it had printing errors on multiple pages. (the page was not centered so it cut off the top of the page and the right hand side) Even the replacement copy for the first one had the same errors. Be careful!
5,Pinkwater - maybe the most fun author of all time,"The imagination of Daniel Pinkwater is fantastic fun. These may be for children, but as an over 50 person, I find them wildly entertaining. I found Pinkwater when my children were growing up with the Toothnasher Super Flash and was entirely hooked.if you find the implausable plausable and the ordinary mundane, I think you will love these books."
1,Worst book Award,Worst book I have ever received. It seems that the author is engaged in selling pre-paid legal services and about 40 pages in this book which I have paid good money for is advertising. Total disappointment.
1,"Disorder in the court,, funny, frivolous,& outrageous lawsut","This is without a doubt the worst book I've ever read. I am sending it back ASAP. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"
1,not happy at all,"I thought i ordered the mini spider ball not the big ones. when it was delivered I was disapinted that they were so big. they are not easy to play with and can not be picked up, to heavy. tried to find the smaller size and no one has them."
3,Satisfying and energetic.,"The Ultimate Sin is a good album from Ozzy Osbourne. It does sound a bit different from the previous albums. This disc has more of a commercial flavor. It's still a good hard rock album. The nine tracks are tight and cohesive. The album's sound is even better on this re-mastered version. Jake E. Lee does well with the guitar work. I dig the guitar riff to ""Lightning Strikes."" Ozzy never disappoints when it comes to his vocals. He's got his own unique voice. His singing is cool on ""Killer of Giants."" My favorite songs are ""Shot in the Dark,"" ""Killer of Giants,"" and ""Lightning Strikes."" Worth a listen."
3,"Decent Ozzy Album, but deserves respect","I found this new at sam goody a couple weeks ago, and knew it was one of the hardest ozzy albums to find. I had to pay $20 for it though.Anyway, it is decent.a lot of the songs sound alike .The best songs on here are The Ultimate Sin, Secret Loser,Lightning Strikes, and Shot in the Dark.Dazzling guitar playing by Jake E Lee, which is the best part of this album. WHY DOES OZZY HATE THIS SO MUCH !!!!!!"
5,technically the best written guitar work ever!!!!,"Jake E. Lee has to be one of the top guitarists in the world. The way this album was written for guitar is just undescribable. Any pro musician would know, pulling off Jake E. Lee live is a feat in itself, no false chords or BS. I am talking true reproduction, note for note. Jake's riffs can be a challenge from hell!...Jake is a monster! The one song that really stands out technically is Never. From the opening staggering broken time riff to the monster solo. and that's just one of the songs!! This album will always get 5 stars..."
4,good,"This a good album for anybody who likes anything to do with Ozzy. I like Ultimate Sin and Lightning Strikes, however I would like to get one thing straight, Jake is a great guitar player, but Randy Rhoades could play circles around him and Zakk can imitate Jake so well it isn't even funny. I'm not saying that this album is bad, so go out and get it!! Note: get Tribute and Live and Loud first though - you won't be disappointed!!"
3,"Well produced, but ...","THere's not one inch of virtuosity in this CD. Tha band plays conventional rock, but that with Ozzy is always garantee of good songs. The disc is what you would call ""average"". The greatess sin in this remastered versions is the front cover of the CD. CD's has already a small space, and they reduced it even more, showing no respect for Boris Vallejo's phenomenal original cover art for this albun."
3,Alot of songs sound the same but it is still ozzy,"Don't get this as your first Ozzy album, I did because it had the best cover art and it threw my intrest of ozzy off for a few months. The songs begin to sound very repitous and looses its feel. The lyrics on this album however are very strong. Espcially in ""secret loser"" or ""ultimate sin."" The best songs are the first two and the last ""shot in the dark"" Still there is nto much in this album unless a diehard fan. Skip this and get Blizzard of Ozz or No More Tears."
2,BY FAR THE WORST ONE FROM OZZY...,"OZZY solo career is great...but in my opinion, this one ULTIMATE SIN, is by far the worst album from OZZY...besides the good title track, i really think the songs ARE TOTALLY UNINSPIRED...."
2,"2,5 stars",This is (according to my opinion of course) the worst album of Ozzy. Besides Shot in The Dark (which is a really good track) and Killer Of Giants the rest songs are really boring and there are no catchy melodies so you can enjoy singing.I can say that the rest songs are just fillers to this unfortunately bad Album. If you have his best of cd which includes Shot In The Dark there is no point in buying this album. The sound and production of this album is like Bark At the Moon production. Its a little bit old but it sounds good. Personally i like the sound of 80s. The problem is in the compositions. Trust me you probably would not like this album. Only for collectors of Ozzy Osbourne's music.
3,Pop goes Ozzy.,"Its catchy, it pop, ITS NOT OZZY that we know and love.If you want catchy hair band metal, then get it it. otherwise, save your money, and buy ANY ozzy-era sabbath album"
4,the ultimate sin,"this cd is underrated and overrated, especially with it going out of print and not being reissued. so, it was great to get this cd. its no blizzard of ozz or diary of a madman, because randy rhoads can never be replaced or topped, as far as ozzy's solo band guitar players go. but it's a good cd, with a very good guitar player. the best songs are 'shot in the dark' and 'the ultimate sin' ... and 'lightning strikes' isnt a ripoff of crazy train, it just sounds similar in a small few spots, at least to some of the other reviewers. this album is worth buying, especially because it will be extremely hard to find in a few years. ozzy is always good; this is no exception."
3,Ozzy's creative low?,"Despite some great singing and masterful guitar work, this album is no doubt Ozzy's lamest studio album in his 40 year career. For Ozzy, the songs are just way below the standard he set for himself on his previous and following releases. Possibly due to the reported friction between Ozzy and Jake E. Lee going on at the time. This CD is really just for Ozzy die-hards only."
2,"Oh, man...","I must state that this is the worst Ozzy Osbourne album, and I've got them all in my CD collection. But, even the ""worst from Ozzy"" is better than the ""best from the majority of bands!"". Ozzy is a genius!! But, unfortunately, neither producer Ron Nevison nor drummer Randy Castillo are... They are, basically, the ones to blame for the lame sound and atmosphere on this record, who had enormous potential, since the songs are basically all very good. This was also Jake E. Lee farewell."
2,"Cool songs, but bad recording","There are some cool kick a** solos in this album, but the thing is, you just can't feel them, you know what I mean? its all muffled...also, listen to the drums, especially the toms, throughout the album..it sounds like somebody just pounding on a table. This album really would have been awsome if they would have spent more time on the sound. if your new to Ozzy I suggest Diary of a madman or Blizzard of Ozz those are my favorites"
3,"Good,","When you really break this cd down, it looks like a poor cd. Because the only standout track is Shot in the dark, it makes the other songs seem meaningless. the rest of the album keeps intrest, and it ends with one of ozzy's best. Also the last album with one of the best guitarists i've heard and seen (on video) Jake E Lee."
3,80s metal...,"I had to write this review to disagree with many of the previous reviews. I for one do not really enjoy this album very much, basically because it has the typical 80s metal sound to it, which I do not like. There are much stronger Ozzy albums, especially Blizzard and Diary, both with Randy Rhoads. While there are some good tracks (especially the title track which is great), overall I don't give this album many listens. If you like the 80s sound you will likely enjoy this album and you can ignore this review, but otherwise I would not recommend it."
2,Acoording to Ozzy himself...,"This, according to Ozzy himself, is his worst album. He used to call it ""THE ULTIMATE DIN...""And I'd like to make a correction to the reviewer MILERGY72 (in the ""Spotlight review""). He says that these are some of the most profound Ozzy lyrics, but that the songs simply did not help. I agree about the songs (that's why I rate this album 2 stars only), but I must warn him that Ozzy simply did not write the lyrics for this album (nor for BLIZZARD, DIARY and BARK AT THE MOON). Bob Daisley did it, as he did for the aforementioned albums. For ULTIMATE SIN, Daisley and Jake Lee were completing the songs sctructures, when Ozzy had a fall-out with Daisley and he left the band. Shortly after, Ozzy sended him the tapes and asked him to write the lyrics. Daisley did it."
4,why does ozzy hate it?,"this is a great album by ozzy. I don't know why he would hate it so much, every song is great. Although the songs are great ozzy's vocals aren't. He sounds like he does today when he talks(maybe he is trying to hard to sing). Still the album is great i would give it a 4 1/2 out of 5 if i could."
1,Not Repairable,"Don't know of what material this inner tube is made from but it will not hold a tire patch, not even a hot patch!"
2,Format is too small,"I bought this atlas at Costco and ended up returning it. Since the page size is only 8 1/2 by 11, it is next to impossible to see enough detail to be useful. You would be better collecting a half dozen fold-out regional California maps. The city maps are somewhat better, but still small."
2,"great book for children, poor quality from Amazon","Although the story is adorable, I was very disappointed with the quality of this so called ""NEW"" book from Amazon. It looked like a copy! The colors were faded, the quality of paper was poor and the credit page was missing. I will think twice about ordering from Amazon again! Bottom line: get the book but go somewhere else to get it."
5,Another gem that Kate Farrell culled from the treasures of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and her knowledge of world poetry.,A magnificent volume that delights every day! I read it every day along with my other volumes with their wonderful illustrations for the poetry
2,covers up stickers,"I'm not sure if this goes for all states, but the license plate frame covers up the sticker in the lower right-hand corner. I know that you MUST have that tag on your license plate in Colorado. The sticker says the last two digits of the year you're supposed to renew your license plate tags. Hopefully, you can't get a ticket for that! I only used the frame on the front license plate."
4,"Excellent performances, but I can't watch it again!","Make no mistake about it -- Dead Before Dawn is a really good film. I always enjoy a good Lifetime movie about a woman who triumphs in the end, despite the most horiffic circumstances. And, although this film is based on a true story, like many other Lifetime movies that I adore, I do not believe that I will ever watch Dead Before Dawn again. The scenes of physical and psychological abuse are so extreme, so well-acted and intense, that I found myself getting physically sick at times -- and this is from a woman who loves horror movies!However, this is a nicely paced drama that fans of crime stories will love."
3,Better Than Expected,"Nice little made-for-TV (Lifetime) thriller with minimum ""oh I can't believe he/she did that"" moments. Ladd plays a battered wife who finally sues for divorce; her husband decides killing her would be much tidier than a court proceeding. Quite well directed for a TV movie - director Charles Correll nicely maintains tension throughout, even though there should be no question in anyone's mind how this is going to turn out. Nicely avoids some of the familiar damsel-in-distress pitfalls. Worth a look."
1,Of limited value,"I found this book to be of limited value. At best it only gives the reader a very basic and overly simplified explanation in some of the general aspects necessary in recognizing and managing potentially hostile situations. In other areas this book is grossly inadequate, in that it fails to even mention some basic guidelines that can be applied in the decision making process when attempting to resolve a hostile situation. I would only use this book as a basic introduction to the subject matter and not as an authoritative text. Of greatest concern, is that a novice will read this book and then become unnecessarily injured because of the minimal and/or outdated information it provides."
4,The software isn't missing- it can be downloaded via the publishers site.,"[...]I too was a bit huffy when the software that was described as being the most awesomely awesome equation solver ever made ever was mentioned right in the introduction. Then a thought occurred- in this day of post-AOL coasters, software is... well, soft. And downloadable. So there you go engineering fellows and fellettes. Equate with abandon..."
2,Missing Software,"Great book, but the description is a lie. The book does not come with any software."
4,I Love It!,"Its easy and inexpensive; takes maybe 10-15 minuets to install; You just insert the software and follow the instructions; and at the right time you plug it into your USB (the software tells you when) and then you go trough a set up process, to adjust the camera and mic. It works perfectly well with Yahoo Chat."
3,"If it worked, it would be great....","I thought that the camera (while working) is really good. I was very impressed with the images and the way that it sat nicely on the top of my laptop. There's no need for a headset when talking to friends and family, as you can play their voice over the computer speakers and the built in microphone picks up your own voice effortlessly.However, it would not let me shut down my system without a blue screen of death, and would not start up again without unplugging the camera. I contacted Logitech and this is a known problem with no current solution. So, this camera may or may not work properly with your computer. You pays yer money, and yer takes yer chances.... If it does work, I can recommend it, but I am taking mine back to the shop."
2,Insultingly inferior software.,"I bought Logitech QuickCam Messenger. The software was Image Studio 7.3.0. (platform: Win XP Pro, P4 2,4MHz). Maybe it is a good camera, but have not seen good perfomance yet. The weakest point is software, it is disaster to use, very rigid, designed for a 10 year old a bit debilitated child, has silly user interface.It lacks specific support for QuickCam Messenger. Although software help explains how to use Motion Detection, there is no such tab.Last but not least. It is not possible to contact Logitech by e-mail."
2,not worth the money,"Every time I tried to move the camera,it would freeze up and I'd end up having to reboot.Click on the top to take a picture and if it touched it on the mic,it would freeze up.No help on that subject either. Very poor picture if you're on yahoo chat.That is all I have right now.I asked around,unfortunately after I spent the money on it and found out that it freezes a lot and you end up having to reboot your pc.Too much trouble for such a little thing.Don't buy this camera."
1,"Hello, it's 1999, we want our crappy webcam back","I have never written a review of a product on Amazon. My wife's parents purchased this webcam (year 2007) so they could Skype with us. Those poor people were sold garbage by someone trying to get rid of old, useless junk by selling it to people that don't know any better. Thanks Logitech for selling crappy products in 2003 and thanks sellers for letting people buy crappy products 5 years after they are obsolete.Video: Grainy, always green."
3,"one more time, my 3rd logitech webcam","I got my 3rd logitech yesterday, now I have 2 messenger and 1 4000 pro, add to my previous review (basically stated this is a ok product and CMOS is not as good as CCD sensor in webcam), once more thing today:Not each quick cam messenger are being created equal, the one I just got (included in Logitech Trio package) has a much more sensitive microphone than the one I purchased seperately before. Now I understand why some people are complaining the quickcam messenger's integrated mic is useless. This new quickcam messenger I got has a constant booming sound unless the room is super quite. But I can do little things for the noisy desktop computer and that noise alone make the integrated microphone useless. If I use it with my notebook, it seems work fine (much less booming noise).My other quickcam messenger's integrated mic seems much toralent to the noise and works fine in either condition. So, should I say: GOOD LUCK!! :)"
4,A good webcam,"a good webcam for only 30$ after rebate, but when I install it in my desktop, it crashed for unkonwn reasons, the weird thing was it automatically rebooted my pc without any pop-window and made my usb keyboard, cd-rom didnot work any more, but I managed to fix the problem. It works well in my laptop. Although I got a lot of trouble with it, I still recommend you to try it, it is a really wonderful webcam!"
1,Piece of JUNK,The picture quality is soo bad! it's not clear at all. I can't see a thing. Bad quality for not a so good price. wouldn't recommend it.
1,Not A Pretty Picture,"I had purchase this product because of the history of logitech and how it's always been successful, but this one isn't worth it. The picture is very grainy and the sound just isn't there. I have tried trouble shooting and nothing has helped. I'm returning this webcam and try to find something else."
2,Not happy with this,"I agree with whoever said too much software installed. I prefer plug and play, no hassle. I also think the image is awful and I have a pretty good computer system. It had static on image and just did not look clear at all. My 8 year old quickcam had a nice picture so I expected this to be nice also.....no luck!Also, the box says Mac compatible, which I thought was cool since I have 2 systems (WinXP/Mac) and then I get home, go to support website & see it's not for Mac. Huh???In any case, this was returned and I'm getting something different."
4,nice cam! color management needs polish though.,"I like this webcam! The image is charper than most of my friends'. You won't see a grainy pic if you adjust the light rihgt. Normally I will get a decent image at night when I turn on both my floor lamp and desk lamp. But don't expect the color to be perfect. I think they used special lighting to make the demo pic in the image libray look vivid. What I got looks kind of pale. Even you adjust the saturation level, it will only add more red to the image. In fact, some of my friends' webcams do a better job in color management. All in all, this is a good cam for the price. It meets my need for a decent image."
3,JUST WONDERING ?,"How is it that reviews done back in November still head the top of the list, and more recent reviews are further back..could it be because of such the favorable rating(5 stars)...I think the average consumer can figure out what is going on here..obvouisly both reviews were written by the same person or ""company""...lets just be fair here and post them as they come...anyone reading those reviews should discard them..they seem a little deceitful to me...but that is just my opinion."
2,Not comfortable with it,"I have been used this product before, the quality is okay, not very impressive though.Now i am using other cameras like IP Camera. I am lucy to find out that some of the IP Camera like IP Camera 8000 can act as webcam, and can be placed anywhere in my house and be viewed anywhere in the world. That's too convenience for me because i did not have to hook camera to my computer anymore.Also imagine you can view how are your babies doing in their bedroom or in the dinning room from outside like your office. And the price of IP Camera is under $100. Just forget webcam, ..."
2,Could not get camera to work,"I ordered this camera for my girlfriend. It installed easy enough but we could never get it to work with iChat, which was the messenger that I was using.It was not as simple as install and use."
1,OK IM camera - Not so good for anything else,"Your satisfaction with this repackaged QuickCam Express (now with microphone!) will depend completely on what you want to do with it. If you are looking for a webcam to use with an IM client it should be fine - the image isn't great, but the compression used on video IM is aggressive enough you'll never notice the difference.If, on the other hand, you want to use it as a web cam, keep looking. The image quality is terrible - beyond terrible - with tons of jpeg artifacts and poor color balance. It's also not clear to me that the marketing guy who wrote 640x480 resolution on the box ever spoke to the person in engineering who actually built a camera capable of only 352x288 images. That disconnect is indicative of the overall attention to detail on this webcam - good enough for IM, but absolutely nothing else."
2,I expected better from logitech,"Not what I was expecting at all. The Picture is noisy no matter what you do. The microphone is next to useless. Cannot set gain and exposure to automatic independant of each other, which might help with the noise. The drivers are a heafty download of 38 MB WITHOUT software and take up 100 MB on your Hard Drive. There is no way to use this cam on linux eitehr since it doesn't use regular logitech drivers. Overall a bad webcam unless all you want is a webcam for the kids to talk to grandma on, then it's an ok deal if you happen to find it on sale. However, most generic brands are cheaper and work better than this."
5,Great webcam,"Good price point. Very pleased with the quality (especially comparing it to three other webcams I've used or set up for family). The face tracking feature is pretty strong and doesn't freak out too ofter (meaning zoom way in on my face). I tend to move around in my chair when I talk, so it works well for my family. The zoom is pretty good and resolution didn't seem to suffer too much when zoomed."
2,"decent video and software, audio sucks","I bought this camera 2 weeks ago. Unlike many other posters here, I had little trouble with the software. I had it installed in 10 minutes. The video is good. Picture gets grainier under artificial light or low lit conditions, but it it is still decent. The one BIG drawback I found with this webcam is how sensitive the microphone is. When talking to someone over AOL IM, we both have to wear headphones. This gets rid of the feedback which creates a horrible background noise. Another solution I have tried is to put a piece of scotch tape over the mike! This eliminates the background noise, at the expense of somewhat dampening the overall audio. Anyway, I would give this camera 4 stars if it weren't for the awful microphone/audio."
1,nice look to it,"liked the look of it but it would not work on my computer, said camera failed, but i would have to pay to ship it back just to get another sent to me and it was more hassle than it was worth"
4,Great Product but useless software,Simply plug and play on XP. But do NOT install drivers from enclosed CD. Had to uninstall drivers ( from CD ) to make the Webcam work in Yahoo Messenger !! Have not check this product with AOL &/or MSN.
3,Too much software required for use,"Great camera, but it installs entirely too much software before you can use it. Most of my other PC cameras just plug-and-play, but this thing requires so many extra software packages and wants to install so much more that it can end up over-writing your existing instant messengers and other products.I though the whole point of USB was for plug-and-play. All this device really consists of is a camera with a built-in microphone. Logitech needs to borrow a page from the generic makers of the Twinklecam and basically don't try to write their own software.Today you can get these in a two-pack for less than sixty dollars. That's highly recommended, but investigate other cameras that have built-in microphones like the Twinklecam (made by a few Taiwanese makers and sold under many different brands)."
2,Not for vista,"I got it to work on XP, but never in VISTA. It always tells me that I need a new driver despite just loading it. It seems like it doesn't see it. So, the bottom line is drivers can not be loaded.Cold Eyes"
1,Poor software,"Don't waste your time with the camera. Everytime I did an install, Windows XP would start to slow down. Did several system restores and re-installs with no luck. If you visit the Logitech support site, you'll see numerous threads with similar driver and .dll problems - with no solutions.Try another brand."
1,Not Worth It!,"I bought this camera today and by looking at the box, it looked like the picture quality was excellent, but when I got it home and then started to use it, well that's a whole different story. The picture is really bad, and my old cam's picture is 1000 times better then this one (Ezonics EZ Cam III). I'm going to return this one tomorrow and go back to Radio Shack and get another Ezonics camera. I lost the bottom part to my first camera and figured this would be a good replacement. The instalation might be quick, easy and cost efficent, but the the camera isn't worth the $30 I paid for it. I wouldn't even recomend this to someone I hate. I couldn't fix the picture however hard I tried and whatever I did, everything was always grainy...never again."
4,Great Value for your money,"If you need a wide range of double pointed needles for an affordable price, this is the set for you. I haven't had any issues with smoothness, cracks, splinters or that they are sized differently from typical needle gauge.The larger sizes are great and sturdy, though the smaller ones get a bit puny. Although I haven't tried the smallest needles yet, I can only assume doing so is going to teach me how to be more delicate with my yarn and work in order to keep them in one piece."
4,Good value for stocking up,"I received these as a gift and I'm very happy with them! It's hard to find 5 piece sets here, and I prefer that to the 4 piece sets. I am a beginner/intermediate knitter and I want to try new projects, so getting such a large assortment of needles at such a low price (less than a dollar a needle) is great! They shipped quickly and are just as described.I will probably give them a sanding before use to minimize any catching, as they are unfinished. Each individual needle has the US size and mm measurement stamped on, which is great for sorting your stash.Very nice value for the price!"
5,Great,I love love these items!! They arrived in great shape and I love having all the sizes to use!! They arrived in good time as well....
4,Good beginner set.,"I got this as a means of getting a wide range of sizes cheaply. It does just that. The bamboo is strong and I have not broken any after 3 years. The ends do show some slight denting from the tips rubbing together, but they don't snag yarn or cause any harm. They are very lightweight also, which is nice as the needles don't fall from the work when you are using others."
4,Great buy for the money,"I purchased these needles in 3 lengths and was delighted. They are well made and feel good in my hands. There is some resistance in the wood, so they are great for making socks and hats where stitches slipping off the needle are a problem. The tips are well formed, but could stand to be a little more pointed. For the cost they are an excellent buy."
4,Totally worth it!,"I was a little skeptical when I ordered these, but I thought, ""Meh, if they suck, they were cheap and they're a good back up for lost needles."" I was very pleasantly surprised! Yes, they are not Clover brand. They are also not $13 a set. I have been using these for about a year, and I find them to be just fine. And for the price, they are better than just fine."
4,Great product for the price,Lots of needles. They are not as smooth as the more expensive ones but they work. Save me time going to stores every time I need new needle size.
4,DOUBLE POINTED KNITTING NEEDLES,COMPLETES MY COLLECTION NO NEED TO STOP A PROJECT IN THE MIDDLE TO GO BUY NEEDLES. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I KNIT ALL NIGHT AND NO CRAFT SHOPS ARE OPEN AT THAT TIME.
5,got 'em all!,"very well made, almost all the sizes you will ever need. I have been using them consistantly and they are smooth and easy to work with. Especially like the longer length."
5,bamboo knitting needles,They are great for the price. I haven't had a problem with any of them so far and have had them for months.
4,almost perfect,They would have been perfect if the smaller ones were stronger. They warp easily making them very difficult to use. I don't use the smaller sizes frequently butI could see this being a real problem for others.
2,Bamboo DPNs,"I am very unhappy with the needles I received. They are in no way ""smooth."" Granted I have only used the size 1 and 2 so far for socks. However, I am having to knit so loosely to be able to slid the yarn across the needles that I fear my socks are going to be too big. Also one of the needle points appears to have a split in it because it keeps getting caught on the yarn. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I do have to agree that they are good for the price. But it is also true that you get what you pay for."
3,No substitute for Takumi,"I needed a lot of DPNs and couldn't afford to top off my small Takumi collection. I was surprised at how many sizes of DPNs were included - I now nearly have a complete set! But they are no substitute for Takumis. The ends are very sharp, so these needles would not be suitable for children. The needles are not *that* smooth, but if you are used to using DPNs, the needles should be fairly easy to adjust to.All in all, the value is great for the number of sets you get. The quality is so-so but not terrible."
5,Great Value and Quality,As a long time knitter I must say that these needles are great. The quality is good and they knit smoothly.
4,Nice Introductory Set,"I received these as a gift at just the right time as I've been learning how to knit socks.While these aren't particularly smooth on the tips (one of my number 4 needles was particularly scritchy), I simply sand them down as needed with an emery board and they're good to go.For the price, this is a great way to get a large array of dpns. The fact that they're in sets of 5 is even better as you can either use all 5 for a project, or use 4 and keep the final one in reserve.A nice feature is that the size of each needle is etched into each needle. I took a pen and wrote the size at the top of each bag, too, so that when I rummage in my needle case I can come up with the correct size more easily.It's a good bargain."
4,Great Bargain,"I just hate having to buy needles every time I start a project so on a frustrated whim purchased this set. I have been very pleased. I have the needle size I need always at hand. I do not find the quality significantly inferior to higher priced needles, although I am mostly using these needles briefly at the end of a project when it comes off the circular needle."
1,Terrible Buy!,"Let me start by saying that knitting can be an expensive craft and I purchased these needles in a variety pack even though I knew they may not be top quality. However, I was not prepared for the horrible quality of these needles. First, I found them to be extremely flimsy. I have eaten with disposable chop sticks from chinese take out that were more sturdy. Secondly, the manufacturer did not bother to taper the points so forget about sliding them through delicate stitches. The effort it takes to use these needles made me want to give up. Lastly and most importantly this product is DANGEROUS! There was no sanding done at the points and I actually got cut two times from the wooden shards sticking out that you cannot see at first. The needles ripped my yarn apart and left me with bleeding fingers. Save yourself the same mistake and do not buy this! Spend a few more bucks and avoid this company and their terribly made products!"
2,battery blues,"I'm glad this tool comes with two XR batteries. I get to use the recip saw for a full 6 minutes when i use both batteries.I can drill 20 1/4"" holes in wood before a battery change.Go to Milwalkee if you want a tool with decent batteries."
5,Synopsis,"(From the cover)Shark Hunt - Part dolphin, part guardian angel, Flipper clamly watches over the usually peaceful waters of Coral Key Park. But when a swarm of sharks go on the attack, Flipper alerts the Ricks family - becoming one lone diver's only hope for help.Agent Bud - It's our friend Flipper to the rescue! A plane carrying two men crashes into the water, trapping them on the ocean floor. As the survivors rapidly run out of air, Flipper and friends Porter Ricks, Sandy and Bud stage a brave rescue mission.52 minutes, in color."
2,Low quality tea leaves,"I had previously purchased a different Taylors product and was very pleased with the quality of the leaves. However, the Moroccan Mint was a disappointment. The tea leaves are broken into very tiny shards, similar to the quality you get when you buy bagged tea. You should look elsewhere if you want higher-quality, loose leaf tea."
1,LARGE knife,"I purchased this knife to replace the one I had to throw away when entering a sporting event. When I opened the box, I was surprised to see a knife that is WAY too big to fit in your pocket. The seller should have posted some sort of dimensions.I'm sure it's a good knife, but not practical for me. Guess it's going to live in my tackle box :("
5,perfect,Exactly what i was looking for. Great knife for everyday carry and also very useful. Victorinox is the best brand for swiss army knifes because they are the original maker
5,EDC,"this is my every day carry, along with my victorinox classic on my key ring. I use the tinker more than any other knife I own. if you have one look closely when opening out the philips screwdriver. where the screw driver hinges you may see a tiny hole on the plastic side cover, just inside. a staight pin fits nicely in the hole. I became aware from a youtube video, its a great discovery. also spare parts are available online, I recently got extra springs for my classics, and an extra tooth pick for my tinker. i had the tinker for about five years now, the sides showing nicks and scratches from so much use, all the functions still work like new. a tiny drop of light oil at pivoting points keeps everything easy to open"
5,"No matter how you slice it, great knife!","It is great not to have to search for tools: the phillips, the straight edge, the can opener,... oh and the knives are all right there in my pocket. I use this knife more often that I expected and I am very pleased to have made this purchase."
5,Still my favorite.,"After carrying this model for over 20 years -- and trying a bunch of others -- this is still my favorite. Has all of the tools I really need and not much else. If I had on wish it would be that the main blade would lock. The new ""parachutist"" models do this but in a much bigger knife."
5,A fine EDC knife,"It's a great size for EDC. It has a Phillips head which I need more often than not. This model does not have the traditional scissors, which is fine with me."
2,Good material but it seemed like they were sleepwalking,"Though this subject matter is life changing I felt that it was presented in a 'business as usual' manner. One particular chapter, the author quoted and quoted and QUOTED from sources that agreed with him...Most of these same sources had their own chapters in this book. All he offered was an editing service and nothing else (i.e., Biblical interpretation or differing viewpoints). ""Hey Guys! This is life changing stuff...stop putting me to sleep!"""
5,"Great for the price, better if you're handy...","(. . .).There a couple of quirks with the player as shipped. Specifically, the subtitles default to ""on"" every time you start a movie, so you have to turn them off with the remote. Also as another reviewer mentioned, the ability to play MP3 files is very picky about the MP3 format. Luckily this player has upgradeable firmware, so with a little research on the internet you can find an improved version of the firmware (NOT supported or acknowleged by the manufacturer) that fixes these problems.This player doesn't have the latest bells & whistles like progrssive scan or multiple disk capacity, but for a low price you can get a very capable player."
5,Simply amazing...,"So when looking for a DVD player do you want a big name brand that you can trust or do you want a little guy who might go out of business in a year. In this case, you want the little guy. This is the most amazing DVD / SVCD / VCD / MP3 / CD player out there. First off, it plays DVDs which is why your interested in it. Then it plays VCDs, what are those? Videos put onto CD-ROMs that you yourself can make with a home computer. Third it plays discs with MP3s on it! ...It comes with the neccessary things needed to hook it to your television and it comes with a simple easy to use remote (with batteries). This thing is perfect, five built in display options, shuffle feature, programable tracks for your CDs and MP3s. A must have! A warning to people with Super Video TVs, there is no sort of link up available for Super Video."
1,A piece of Junk!,"I own one of these. It stopped working on the 94th day I bought it. Customer support is practically non-existent. The only ""human"" I could talk to was the receptionist (extremely rude!!!) at the corporate office who told me everyone was ""busy"" and that she could only take my name and number. After many long distance calls, calls to their toll-fee number (which is always busy), letters, and emails (all which have gone unanswered), I'm stuck with a defective DVD player. I even posted my complaint on their website (which promised an answer within 24 hours). That was over a month ago, and still nothing. After doing some research on the net, it seems this is a defective machine. I will never, ever buy anything with the name ""APEX"" affixed to it!"
1,She is right on,"I agree with Juanita, it is a piece of junk. Mine stop working 64 days after purchase. Now I found out that it is discontinued and there is no replacement for it. A totally waste of money."
5,Further information,"It is not clear from the promotional material, but this appears to be a reprint (or new edition, perhaps) of the 2002 title published by Siddhi Publications (also still in print)."
1,Please Note Well,"As the seller informs us, when we click on each of the three items,each of his three offerings represents 1/5 or less of the set (or some such division) and not the set, as one would believe.Since the whole set has just been re-released in a single box and is available cheaply, esp. from sellers, the potential buyer should consider carefully why he would want to pay more for the combined partials than for the entire set.Once so informed up front, any buyer may do as he wishes. However this information should be stated on the offering as represented and not merely after clicks.The set is highly recommended for those with interest in older, ""historical"" recordings.C.1/2 of the cantatas have either a boy soprano or boy alto soloist (or both) while the remaining half have adult females."
1,Color Thrive for blond hair,I think the ingredients have changed since the new style bottle came into use.I have been sadly disappointed by this shampoo which used to be my favourite.It no longer gives my hair the body and gloss that the old one did.Why was it altered?very disappointed
1,Poor quality - quickly die out on you,"I looked forward to getting Energizer-branded batteries for my Nikon camera, so I bought three of these batteries. But, they aren't Energizer. They're made by a company called Technuity and are licensed under the Energizer brand.After a few uses, they quickly died out either refusing to take a charge, or taking a charge but running dead within minutes of starting to use them. If you want a quality battery, find one made by Nikon."
4,Spare Tire Cover,"With all the different sized tire covers out there, this one was the one I choice because it was basic and durable and does exactly what it should which is cover the tire and prevent dust and damage to it."
2,"Search for ""Black yoga blocks"" and save money","I've owned a pair of these before and they serve their purpose, but everybody knows these things are over priced for a couple pieces of foam. Try A/Bing them with a pair of black yoga blocks also available on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Milliard-Block-Beveled-Edges-Black/dp/B00994II5C/ They will do the same exact thing, and look just as good if not better for a lot less, and no one will know that you are using yoga blocks. They are made from very similar material. Don't say I never did you a favor. A pair of yoga blocks will also give you three different height options. They also come in cork for a few dollars more, which is kind of a cool look for your studio.Hugger Mugger Cork Yoga Block"
3,Not really what I needed,"I originally got the pads to change the angle of my monitors and point them more towards my ears. For this purpose they are kind of ugly and I eventually found some very small speakers stands that just raise the speakers up 4-5"". With my setup, I could not hear any benefit when using the pads vs not using them. I was using with a pair of 8"" m-audio 8X8a speakers that were just sitting on a wooden desktop. The speakers come with a very small isolation pad."
4,i can feel the difference,I purchased these mopads for my hs50ms after reviewing and researching the worth of these. I have to say I'm impressed. They do the job my lows and mids are picked up by the ear much more now that I have these mounted. 4 stars for the fact I can still feel a little bass through my desk.
2,no big different,"after i read all the positive reviews here, i ordered it from here Amaon. i'm so looking forward to this, coz the neibor downstairs once came up and complained about the bass noise from home theater. i placed the subwoofer on a mental open shelf, and the shelf is on apartment carpet. the subwoofer is compact size, so one or two pieces of that foam are enough. after using them, you can hardly notice the difference about the the vibration. overall, you dont need spending so much on this everywhere-can-find foam."
4,One pair but with 8 pieces,"I hesitated purchasing these since the product picture shows just two feet and description says ""1 pair"". However, there are 4 feet and 4 foam angle inserts for a total of 8 pieces. Buy at $24 but not at $44 when not on sale. Now I'm able to adjust the angle to perfectly aim the monitors at my ears not at my chest. I have my speakers on stands on either sides of my computer desk. Now they're aimed just right and sound is better detailed, as it should be."
4,Works as described,"This simply works. A little pricey for some special-cut pieces of foam, even if the foam is high quality and precision-cut."
4,Does the job,"These foam pads do exactly as they are intended. They dampen the noise from the speakers to my desk to lessen vibration. Since buying these, don't think I've had a bit of a problem with vibration. Little high in price, but you get what you pay for. And they are stylish as well."
3,"I think Auralex products are way, way, way over-priced.","Foam by any other name is still foam.....$40 for a few pieces of foam is ridiculous. Yeah I bought 'em so I guess the jokes on me. They seem to work fine, so I've no issue with functionality....although how well they work is a purely subjective thing. But c'mon Auralex (and all you other sound suppression/isolation brands, PrimeAcoustic, Clearsonic)...your pricing is just ridiculous to the point of being insulting to your customers...this is why I gave the 3 star rating."
5,actually make`s the dieference,"actually make`s the dieference i recommend all the auralex products you can make the diference in your references ,.. it is a little expensive but worth the price"
5,Thick sturdy pads for resting center channel speaker on,"I bought a couple pair of these to rest my center channel speaker on. My entertainment center has glass shelves, and these helped greatly in getting rid of vibrations. I like how they are sloped and how you can aim your center channel up or down, for better sound."
1,Buy Some Foam,"Bought these for an entertainment center woofer being that I have wood floors. All they are is high density foam, certainly not $25 worth of foam. Opened the box, closed, the box, and sent them Back."
3,Helpful product,I bought these to both insulate and angle a set of M-Audio AV40s I use on a computer. It's a quality product but it doesn't work flawlessly on the hollow top desk I have my computer on (I see this and similar desks everywhere so this could be an issue.)
2,Pricing is WAY out of line,"As has been mentioned by other reviewers, this product consists entirely of strips of foam rubber. Auralex is too greedy here. I sent mine back."
4,MoPad'$,"These work well, but are overpriced. Every home, project, or pro studio can benefit from using these, & more probably would if they we're priced right. Lucky for me, I bought these on a black Friday ""Flash Sale"" that made it easier for me to take the leap. These really do isolate your monitors & make them sound more ""together"". If your not crazy about your monitors, try these, the problem might not be your speakers. If you do like your monitors, try these & you'll probably love them! I would give these 5 stars if they were priced right!"
1,my fault,We don't use this item b/c it's too small!!! We didn't pay attention to the dimensions and it's too expensive to return or exchange. blah!
2,A Bit Disappointed,I've had this product for almost a year now--roughly 11 months since I first bought it. The side seam has begun to rip and the hole there is getting larger and larger by the day. The material used to make the sackpack is good and you'd think that it would last much longer than 11 months but mine has begun to rip. I am a bit disappointed considering that it's an Adidas sackpack.And it wasn't like I put this bag to anything hardcore either. It was used mainly as a bag to carry my work clothes to and from work. I've never filled the bag to the point it couldn't fit anymore in the 11 months I've used this bag.I don't recommend buying this bag unless you don't mind it lasting only a year at most.
5,Does the job,"I can't fault a sackpack for holding things and being a sack. It is pretty cheaply made, but is also relatively cheap. The small pocket on the flap is invaluable and makes this item much better than many others."
3,Ok product,I mostly used this to grind coffee. It did work well for that purpose. I really didn't use it for much else.
3,"Not their greatest, but not bad either 3.5 stars","Lots of negative reviews here. I found Heretic to be a step up from Gateways to Annihilation, which I found to be quite boring and somewhat overproduced. Heretic reminds me of a mix of Formulas Fatal To The Flesh and their old sound, say from Domination (another overproduced album). Lots of people have complained about the production of the album, but I find it to be just fine.There are some pretty good songs on this album: Enshrined by Grace is an immediate standout, Praise the Strength, Curse The Flesh, & Striken Arise (thats not Steve Tucker singing is it ?). Unfortunately, there is a whole bunch of filler that takes away from the overall feel of the album. There really are only 8 songs, but the CD has 14 tracks, plus meaningless bonus tracks. The only bonus tracks that are interesting are the Drum Check, and Abyssous."
2,ahh...,"i'll be honest with you , i love metal, and you can say i love death metal..but this cd, is boring. whats the deal with the constant speed bursts, and all this fast buisness? you cant even comprehend the music. its ridiculous, and boring, and repetative, and has no direction. the drummer sucks in my opinion, and couldnt be worse. oh, wow, 100mph, yeah....and....so....what...who cares? it sounds so fake, and played out. hopefully, when i recieve their first album, ALTARS OF MADDNESS, i will actually see some direction in it, and some meaning, other than speed, and idiocy. i am only basing this review on this album alone, now, i will try to see the light in it, and maybe it will grow on me. but as of now, this is boring."
2,Their worst album,"Unfortunately, Morbid Angel made a mediocre album with Heretic. Their previous one also wasn't particularly amazing. This is by far Morbid Angel's worst album. I definitely don't recommend this for anyone, except perhaps rabid Morbid Angel fans. I gave it two stars because a few bits here and there are good."
2,Worth the $.92 I paid for it.,"I got this off the bargain shelf at a local used book store just to try it out. I have to say that, not being a big death metal fan, it is better than I expected. Based on the reviews I have read I am looking forward to checking out some of MA's older stuff. To be more specific, the drumming on this CD is retardedly boring. Only a few times throughout the entire CD do you ever hear anything other than machine gun thirty second notes on the kick. Secondly, the guitar solos sound really out of place in the mix. And finally, the bonus CD is just a waste of disc space. I have never heard of a band releasing a track of just a guitar solo from another song. They are technically sound solos, but pointlessly out of place without the rest of the music. Are they trying to release some kind of study material for aspiring death metal guitarists or just being pretentious? Either way, it sucks. But, overall, it was worth a buck and the time it took to leave this review."
4,Some of the best songs with Steve...,"Tucker are found on this album...but, overall Heretic as a whole album is not their finest moment. It almost seems like they tried to make another formulas fatal to the flesh with all the instrumentals, you know? The instrumentals on here though don't come anywhere close to the ones of formulas though. I think that took away a lot from this cd. But the actual full-length songs on here are some of the best with steve tucker in my opinion. At first i didn't like this cd, i bought it when it came out along with six feet under's bringer of blood, thank god i quit listening to six feet under...anyways i sold it back but then i started getting songs stuck in my head so later on i went back and re-bought it. Now i listen to it quite a bit actually. Good songs but overall not their finest moment!"
3,What happened to these guys? Remix this mess.,"I used to love Morbid Angel, these guys were the godfathers of extreme/death metal in America. What the f*** happened? The sound of this album is not unlike a transitor radio cranked up to 11 (where's the bass dammit?) and because of the sound the compositions just don't seem to have the fire that Morbid Angel used to provide. Too bad 'cause some of this stuff is great and could have been amazingly brutal had the songs been mixed properly. I'm afraid that since Dave Vincents departure Trey and Pete have been foundering or maybe floundering, ie flopping like a one sided fish on dry land."
2,WTF ARE YOU DOING GUYS?!?!?,"contrary to the previous reviews, the consistency is SH*T! this album is an exact immitation/reproduction or close to it, damnation and gateways... new or old fan don't waste your money. love morbid angel as i do i have to criticize them on this one I WANT NEW STUFF DAMMIT!"
3,good but nowhere near their best,i don't personally think it sounds like morbid angelit sounds like some death metal band but i still like iteven though this album isn't half as good as dominationi don't think they have made a cd that good since then
1,Death Metal Gods flop big time with this loser!,"I've given this MA disc several good listenings to and it just plain sucks. I really hate to say this too. As a guitar player myself, I have nothing but respect for Trey and Pete. THey are truly gifted musicians. However, this album is just plain boring. There are NO catchy or interesting riffs, the production quality sucks and the vocals are NOT up to the standards of Dave Vincent. Unless you're a die hard MA that will listen to anything thay put out, no matter how crappy it is, then save your money. The latest Cannibal Corpse album Kill is a WAY better album and represents where Death Metal is TODAY in terms of catchy, brutal riffs and blistering leads. Pat's guitar work in the new Canniabal, and The Wretched Spawn, blows this away on every front."
1,Many Steps Backwards......,"I think this album is a HUGE STEP BACKWARDS considering that the album before this ('Gateways to Annihilation') is Morbid Angel's most crushing release whether you like it or not! (In fact, of the 3 albums made w/ Tucker, 'Gateways' is really the ONLY ONE worth the money!) Even Tucker eluded in an interview that this album wasn't very good. If Vincent comes back permanently, I hope Trey steps up to the plate & writes some killer material again because Morbid desperatly need it!"
1,Altars of NoTalentWhatsoever,"Wow, what an amazingly crappy piece of music publishing. There really is nothing more sad, pathetic and just plain nerdy than a gang of men gathered together into a little studio, squealing, croaking, crying and squawking like cattle with a bad dose of scour, all dressed the same, prancing around in tight leather pants singing 'oh, satan, we love you, we love you, we really do'. What a pathetic bunch of sad, sad, sad little boys. Bet you they have pictures of Britney on their walls, but they've drawn spandex and horns on her. Fallen angels? Fallen fairies more like.Now, go find an album by Pestilence, Atheist, Cathedral or Obituary - now THAT's music."
3,Good...but below Morbid's Standards,"It's competent, but sort of pedestrian in approach. Gone are those quirky solos and squeals that seemed to come out of nowhere from previous releases. There doesn't seem to be as much variety within the sounds of the riffs throughout the album. Most lack contrast. The vocals are kind of interesting at times, changing to a high pitch on some songs.Where previous albums had a clear concept, this album seems like it was bunched together without any kind of goal in mind, and as a result, does not flow well.These guys are still top-notch musicians, but they need to start writing with the focus and power they once wielded."
2,Not what I was expecting !!,"I must say that I'm a big Morbid Angel fan. I really like just about all their albums including Gateways. They always put out a strong release, except for the Domination album. I'm not really getting into this one. A couple tracks are very strong and others are just plain boring. The production sounds hollow and everytime I get into a track, It's followed by a weak track. There's no flow to this album. Morbid could do so much better and be way more brutal. I wish they would pick up the pace and go back to being more of a speed Death Metal act. When I saw them on stage in May 2004, the tracks off this album were played at a faster pace and sounded much better than the studio recordings. Regardless, they are the kings of Death Metal and when they took the stage they blew every other band away."
2,THEY NEED DAVID VINCENT BACK!!!,"This Can't Keep Going On. This New Singer ""STEVE"" Just Sucks. AFTER DOMINATION THIS BAND REALLY WENT TO THE DOGS. THEY LET GO OF DAVID VINCENT AND THAT WAS THAT. I Cannot Recommend This To Anyone. I like them dont get me wrong, but I miss Dave."
1,Morbid Crap!,"Morbid Angel just plain suck. Okay the evil guitarist AzaGOTH or something like that can play decently, this however doesn't save the band from being lame. The singer cannot growl at all, he sounds like he choking. The riffs are slow and repetative and sound very similar to each other. The drumming is somewhat speedy but drowned out behind the slow evilness of the whole album. They chant satanic (give me a break) words again and again. This made me laugh and squirm at the same time. If you want heavy skull crushing metal don't but this. Listen to...Beheaded, Dying Fetus, Lamb of God, Internal Bleeding, Dillinger Escape Plan, Iced Earth, Hatebreed, Beyond the Flesh, Deicide, WasteformSave your money this is a joke."
1,Death Metal sucks,"The singer is incomprehensible, the backing music sound identical in every ""Song"", as does the ""singing"". And Morbid Angel sound identical to every other Death Metal band on the market.At least Nu-Metal is more varied!"
1,Too many syntax errors,"I bought this to learn CGI scripting and was very frustrated by the numerous syntax errors or even omissions from the code.The CD had very little on it, it would have been better to knock $10 off the price and forget the CD. If the sample programs were on the CD, he might have bothered to actually try them. Instead it seems he wrote them off the top of his head and never bothered to test them.I suppose the techinical editor is partially to blame for letting these by. If you a beginner, skip this book, it'll only frustrate you."
1,"Not up to ""For Dummies"" standards","I often pick up books from this series when I am interested in something I haven't studied before. Usually I come away with a good basic understanding of the subject matter but in this case, I found myself irritated by the author's patronizing and supercilious style -- Perhaps he really did think that only dummies would read this book?Perl is an elegant and beautiful programming language and is suported by a friendly and open community that works with Macs, Win32, and Unix. If this book is your only contact with Perl, you'll come away thinking, with the author, that many of its users are ""Unix geeks.""Select a different book for your first introduction."
4,Best Book For PERL Beginners!,"This is the best beginner book on PERL. It doesn't assume your running UNIX and that your not a C programmer. I'd recommend this book to anyone that wants a beginners view of PERL. And unless your already a C programmer, I'd really recommend this book before any of the O'Reilly books (It doesn't take away all the pain and confusion but it does help). I now own three books on PERL and this is by far my favorite!"
5,Very useful book,"This is probably one of the best of the Dummies books. I found it very useful when I first started learning Perl, and I still refer to it eight months later. It's also one of the best Perl books overall; I have 7 of them (I have a very liberal expense account), but I use Perl for Dummies more than any of them."
4,"Good book, but no review questions.","Perl 5 for Dummies is a great book. It contains a treasure trove of information. It will get you up and running Perl fast. A few problems gives this book 4 stars: CD is out of date(Perl is free tho, so...) and no review questions. Often times I had to read the chapters 2 or 3 times for all of the information in the book to sink in. Otherwise, its great, and I loved the cartoons."
1,"Really useless, don't waste your money.","There is nothing to study about japanese comics. It doesn't matter whether Havard professor studied comics or any fifteen years old boy studied comics. You don't need to know everything about Japanese history, in order to understand comics. it's part of the pop culture. This book tries to over-analyze everything. Don't waste your time. Don't wast your money."
4,My Favorite Universe,"Being a few decades out of college physics, this book offers some amazing new information, in a pleasing well written format. Though these cosmic ideas are hard to describe, the authors try to connect to our experience, for example when discussing the density of a neutron star ""That's life stuffing a heard of 50 million elephants into a thimble"". The book is divided into three aspects of natures: motion, matter, and energy. The final chapter deals with frontiers, such as the search for life and Drake equation, and how the big bang brought forth the universe (though it seems incomprehensible that all space and matter initially ""could have passed through the eye of a needle""). The book is well illustrated with both drawings, and photographs such as deep space shots from the Hubble Space Telescope. I used this as a good accompaniment of the Teaching Company's class ""My Favorite Universe""."
2,Power Antenna Worse than rabbit ears,Installed the antenna on a Panasonic TV. Most channels worked better (except for Channel 2) for about 1 day however none of then could be adjusted as per the manual - I was happy then all channels got worse and worse and the machine is back in the box and rabbit ears back on top.Maybe the signal strength in my area is too high?? but I tried all options of high/low ears and physical orientations.Don't know if it is a defect in this particular one or just a big waste of time altogether.
2,No better than my $5 radio shack antenna,"I have an old Radio Shack antenna and thought I would get better results with the [price]RCA. It does amplify the signal, but the antenna part without amplification gets such bad reception, that after the signal was amplified it only reached clarity levels of my original antenna. This works OK, but you can get similar results for a fraction of the price."
2,Comparable to a non-amplified ... antenna,"Got this RCA ANT200 from a local BestBuy .... It works slightly WORSE than my non-amplified Recoton 350 antenna (old one, ...OK). In fact the Recoton gets better reception on two channels (11 and 13) than the RCA. The amplifier in the ANT200 introduces sligh amount of noise, which makes the picture a bit brighter, but not better or clearer. The ghosts do not diminish either. The snow is about the same. I'm returning it... It has an A/B switch whith lets me compare the two antennae immediately without switching the cables, so the differences (or the lack there of for the most part) b/w the two were obvious. Not worth it in my opinion compared to a cheaper non-amplified antenna for the reception I get. Perhaps for weaker signals in remote areas it might be better, but in the urban area where I live it does not improve anything beyond the non-amp antenna I got."
2,"Good UHF, Bad VHF","All the UHF stations come in clear as a bell, but the VHF reception is quite lousy. No matter where I place the unit (even placed it on my patio to test) I can't get a good picture at all on any VHF station, and the NBC channel hardly comes in at all, despite living less than 15 miles from the station. An ok antenna, but not worth the price tag. I'll probably end up returning it and buying a different brand. I still wont subscribe to cable though!"
4,Read this!,"Please be aware that this antenna does not work within houses that have stucco walls! My house has stucco walls, therefore I had to return it. I also tried it on a tv in another house w/out stucco walls & it worked quite well."
1,"no luck, dosen't work!","Bought this antenna from a local best buy hoping to avoid cable. I have Recton rabit ears already, but was hoping for better reception with the amplified antennas. My reception got slightly worse. No matter what position the I put it in I could't get the static to clear up. It never got better than my cheap rabbit ears. I took it back and tried an even more expensive one, Jensen tv930, it also dosn't work. Since some people seeem to like these amplified antennas, just buy it from a retailer with a good return policy."
2,Know your area before buying,"I thought I would get more channels than my old rabbit ears with this RCA power antenna, but it isn't true. I live in a valley, and I only get two more channels than I did previously (and the reception is only average).My advice is to buy from a local retailer like Radio Shack. That way you can easily return the antenna if you don't get good results.I'm going to try a rooftop antenna now."
5,Great book,"I'm actually not a trader but I like good novels and this was one of the best of the year. It's not only an expose of the Wall Street world---these people who like you to think they're busy running the world yet can barely run a normal life. Lasser has written a great morality tale for the end of the last century and the begining of this new one. Smart, funny and dead on, it makes it hard to wait for the next book of this rising star."
4,Good description of what really goes on..,"The cast of characters seem so real and plot so plausible, I loved the book. I work in that industry, and there are all the characters there. It is a well descriptive book that I would reccomend for anyone."
5,All I Could Want,"I read Battle Creek and I think Scott Lasser's second novel shows that he is a rising star among new authors. Lasser has identified what is, for many of us, the central conflict in our life: namely, the balance between providing for our family and seeking an enjoyable and meaningful career. Although it is an issue which receives considerable press these days, Lasser's characters offer a refreshing and lively new vehicle to present this conflict. Lasser's main man, Barry Schwartz, contemplates the question what are we willing to do--what are we willing to risk, to go beyond paying the bills to lift our families up into that top 1% of society that no longer has any concern about money? Although Barry stumbles to a conclusion, after putting the book down I was unsure of what the proper balance should be. That's what I liked the best. It was an enjoyable read and it left me feeling a bit uneasy. I look forward to Lasser's next work!"
2,Why should we care?,"Scott Lasser wants us to care about him and his selfish co-workers, but he never goes beyond making them one-dimensional characters. The people he introduces were so stereotypical, I wondered if it was just bad fiction."
2,Not all I wanted,This book shows the Wall Street world with some interesting detail but overall I found it unsurprising.
3,Where's the heart (and the editor)?,"This book was a decent light read. I have a thing for books that show a world or industry I know little about. This book accomplishes it for the world of bond traders. However, the book lacks a sense of realism. The protagonist seems to see the trap of greed in front of him, but continues anyway.My biggest qualm with the book is the use of the word Infinity instead of Infiniti when discussing the japanese automaker. Although I usually can live with spelling mistakes in books, this small detail destroyed the sense of authenticity that the book was striving for. My advice is get an editor and don't rely on spellcheck."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I enjoy cheezy 1 star movies. What I do not enjoy is a shoddy quality that looked to be pirated in some back alley in China. The truth is that the back alley in China would have done a better job than what I had put in my DVD player. I also echo the other 1 star reviews here as far as the quality of the disc themselves. You are better off finding an old VHS tape and a player that still works.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND NEVER BUY ANYTHING BY THE COMPANY THAT PRODUCED THIS SHODDY POOR EXCUSE FOR A DVD.
2,I really wanted to like this.,"The peppermint aroma was refreshing. Unfortunately, after using the soap, I developed a horrible itchy rash that lasted a few days. I think I would've liked it much better if my skin weren't so sensitive."
5,Smells great,"First of all I was totally impressed to received the item so quickly!! I ordered it on Friday (12/14) and it arrived on Monday (12/17) so kuddos on that!! Everything is so natural, no perfumes or dyes that makes my skin dry. This so is so gentle on my skin.This product is worth ordering!!!!! Enjoy the different scents."
1,Misleading title,This is a religious sect book not about Pitcairn.People will feel cheated when they past page 20.Why not say its a book for religious extremist.
4,Bien,El accordeon esta chingona oy es mi segundo dia tocandola y no puedo parar de tocarla! The accordion is badazz!!todaynis my second day playing it and i cant stop playing it!!
5,Love it.,"I purchased this one 'cause it brings back so many pleasant memories. It is a rather strong scent, and it might considered ""dated"" by some, but it is a really good sweet, classy and elegant perfume, great for special nights out. My only complain would be that I ordered a full retail bottle, and I got one branded ""TESTER NOT FOR SALE""."
1,never received refund,I returned the item within a week of purchasing as it wasn't what I'd expected. It's been more than a month. I have yet to receive a refund. I'm never buying from these guys again.
5,We love you Michael!,This album had touched my heart and soul like nothing else ever has. You can almost feel the emotion in his expressive voice. Every time I listen to this album it is all too easy to imagine that Michael is right there singing to me. This is a must have for any music fan.
1,MIKE--SCREAM YOUR LUNGS OUT....YOURE FINISHED !,"Wonder how some artists end up in bargains bins at your local music store ? Relive the precious BOLTON moments and you'll soon understand how a balding artist once CHARTED and is now lucky to open for a SESAME STREET PARADE at a local WAL-MART. His catalogue of songs are not the problem, as a writer BOLTON can compose a decent pop song, however as an artist he is FINGERNAILS ON A CHALK BOARD. Totally IRRITATING ! He best get use to being referred to as a ""HAS BEEN of THE 90S"" ! This CD is the perfect example of HORRID OVERDONE POP VOCALS from THE 1990s ! Stay away from this stinker !"
3,Good Price,"The molds used to make the parts for this plane are very old. Some of the parts do not fit well. The landing gear is very weak. See photo I added with the support legs I added to hold the plane up. The kit has a very good price, so it's a good starting point for beginners."
1,Pieces did not fit well,"I was excited to receive this kit. I began building it and painting some of the finer parts. When I attempted to assemble the fuselage to the wings the problems started. The fuselage seemed twisted, it would not fit straight onto the wings. I tried sanding certain pieces, but nothing worked. I had to discard this product, as it was impossible to straighten the fuselage enough for it to fit onto the wings. I assume there was a flaw with my kit, and that others have worked well."
1,horrible,you have to paint it and everything i just want a model plane. u know some people arn't so skilled at painting.
1,3 Years is a deal!,"I WISH my monitor lasted three years!!! I am obviously a glutton for punishment, but I've purchased TWO of these monitors. Neither lasted more than a year before doing dim and dark. No matter how many times I hit the + sign to increase the brightness (out of desperation and dispair), the monitors each slowly got darker and darker until they quietly passed away. I agree 100%. View Sonic, at least this particular model, is [substandard]."
1,The book needs a chapter on ethics,"I was going to give this book to my cousin who will be entering Brandeis University in the fall as a business major. However, after reading the book and doing more research on the author, I learned that he is the inventor of Prepex, which is a device invented to circumcise males in Africa.There are many harmful side effects with the device, such as post-surgery de-gloving of the remaining penile skin.And, the harmful effects are nowhere to be found online, while the device is advertised by his wife as though it is a godsend!!Shame on this man !! No major medical organization recommends routine circumcision and here he is capitalizing on questionable studies.One only needs to do a video search for ""Dr. Dean Edell Circumcision Fallacy "" to see that Dr. Oren Fuerst knows nothing about ethics.Don't buy this book unless, of course you want to invent and sell faulty medical products to people in impoverished countries."
2,"Too Superficial and ""Pop Psychology""","The book comes across as more of a game than anything truly useful. Finding out your ""type"" is fun, but beyond that the book provides little benefit in the way of sorting out career options. Using this book to determine your type assumes that you come from a near perfect family environment that allowed you to be the person you naturally wanted to be all your life. How many of us didn't have parents who pushed us to one degree or another to be something we are not? Even when we grow older and process through this reality, the effects linger. This book devotes less than a page to acknowledging this reality and doesn't have any advice or guidance on how the ""are"" in ""doing what you are"" is likely a complex process for most people and requires more than a cookie-cutter approach. Save your money and buy a good biography or work of fiction instead."
1,AI and VR? Are we talking about the same book?,"The AI techniques presented were overly simplistic, and the examples were somewhere near useless(especially when they were supposed to be geared towards agent intelligence). The VR section seemed to be missing. There was a simplistic 3D app in OpenGL, but no discussion on agents using upper(or lower for that matter) level AI to interact in a VR environ. Save your money."
1,Not worth the money.,"This book takes about 2 hours to breeze through. The author spends about as much time on how to write OOP code as he does the AI concepts. If I wanted lessons in OOP, I'd buy a book about OOP. This book was supposed to be about AI! Also, he spends very little time explaining the theory of ai. Statements like ""It does not make sense to use crossover operations to evolve the population for recurrent neural networks"" are never qualified with an explanation. The reader never gets a sense of why he should be doing what the author describes. Rather than explain anything, the author just sites his other publications. Very poor. This is the real kicker: practically half of the book is dedicated to code dumps or space wasting Booch diagrams. The code dumps aren't even accompanied by anything meaningful, just things like, the constructor initializes the data. If I wanted to see the code in print, I'll use my own printer, thank you."
5,"little know WW ll story about the ""exodus""","an incredible story about a very brave young woman who is one of the many ""footnotes"" in history whose story has come to light. I had the delightful experience of meeting the real ""star"" at the young age of 90 plus. Talk about spunky. Harry Truman had to love this lady. A movie worth watching- make sure you order the correct ""Haven""- now I have two. Definitely a ""must see""---------"
1,Not worth it!,The movie is not historically accurate and feels like some kind of one-sided propaganda.It seems like the story is really told from a Jewish perspective.The story of the people is sad but the theme is the same and the plot of the story is actually a bit tedious to handle for too long.
5,brilliant,"This collection showcases the drumming par excellence of Count Ossie, one of the pioneers and cultural icons of Jamaican music,, in a very relaxed settling.With guests like Horace Andy, Freddie McGregor, the Heptones, Israel Vibrations, and produced by Bunny Lee, the group takes off on standards like ""Jah Rastafari,"" ""It Ain't Easy,"" ""Ethiopian Romance,"" ""I Don't Like It,"" and ""Jah Jah the Conquerer.""A wonderful session focusing on the late Count Ossie- well worth picking up to hear the legendary master at work."
3,Quite Good,"I think that this DVD player just plays as good as you paid. Don't expect to be an excellent equipement, but it won't let you down."
3,Guessing game,"My youngster loved her fist book like this -- Soft Shape Take Along: MY PURSE, because it included fun things you'd find in a real pocketbook. This one is cute but it has silly wording on each page to make a guessing game out of each page (""Who got 2 treats? Who got 3?"" ""Who got 4 treats? Who got 5"") I think if the book had to include words at all it would have been better to make more sense and not be so repetitive. The Halloween shapes are adorable, cats, ghosts and a pair of friendly bats. Lift them off the page to reveal the number of candy corns hiding underneath...2,3,4 or 5. It's a guessing game book, cute but not worth the high pricetag."
5,One of my favorites!,I have given this book out to so many people and not just to kids! The verse is beautiful and the illustrations are amazing. I always recommend it and everyone has loved it. Definitely a classic and a treasure.
3,Classic but hard to see the checkers,"Liked the storage idea- got it for a child learning to play checkers. VERY difficult to distinguish between the red and black checkers, believe it or not!! The red is a VERY dark red- Good for a decorative wall hanging, not so great for playing with."
5,An Heirloom quality Checker board.,"This is an excellent quality checker board. I do have to agree with other customers, however. The red checkers are much too dark. I took very-fine sanding pager and sanded just enough black off of them to make them look very red, up with an antiqued, worn look.It was a gift for my husband and he was so pleased!"
5,I love this board game,This checker board is well made and looks great. I like the size of the board and the feel of the checkers.
5,Best checkers board!,"This is the best board I have found. Durable, solid, beautiful! But, as stated by another reviewer, the red chips are way too dark. But we just used some sandpaper to sand each one and they turned from a dark red to a medium red."
1,POOR ADVERTISING!,"I was VERY disapointed to see that this book was so religious. EVERY page related to some sort of religious conversation. While I am Christian, I did not buy this book looking to tell my child about my prayer or beliefs. It is very misleading and now I have to pay the return shipping costs for this, which I am not happy about. I also purchased the Father's Memories book by the same author and was also VERY, VERY disapointed. DO NOT buy unless you are looking for a book to discuss your CHRISTIAN beliefs... if that IS what you are looking for, then this would be a good book."
3,"product as expected, condition disappointing","The product arrived as described. We already had one for a Father Legacy so we new what to expect. The condition was very disappointing though. The book appeared as though it had sat on a shelf for years. There were dust stains on the cover that would not come off and there was no time to order another one before Christmas. I was embarrassed to give it. I was suprised that it was even shipped since it came from Amazon themselves, not a third party seller. I give it a 3 for the condition."
5,Mother's Memories to Her Child,This is the perfect gift to give my children. I am also going to purchase one for my parents so I will have something I can remember them by.
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY,"This toothpaste made my gums swell, bleed and become extremely sensitive and sore, to the point that brushing became very painful. You may wonder why someone would continue to use toothpaste after that, but in my defense I am switching from Tom's toothpaste (all natural) so I just assumed all toothpaste had a medicine smell and I just couldn't imagine that toothpaste could do that to you. This toothpaste smells like formaldehyde to the point that I brought it up to work and had people smell it. They all said it smelled like poison.IF YOU OWN THIS THROW IT AWAY. IF YOU'VE GIVEN IT TO YOUR CHILDREN TAKE IT AWAY AND TAKE THEM TO THE DOCTOR. THIS IS POISON."
1,Worthless,"For the most part, this book contains quotes from Khadafy's three-volume Green Book, an unintelligible collection of his thoughts (if they can be termed that) on history, politics, economics and life in general. Not only are they not particularly entertaining, but the graphics employed by the authors make them difficult to read.The only entertaining thing in the book is Moammer's rather extravagant claim that, among other aspects of Arab culture that the West has stolen are the works of William Shakespeare -- his real name, it seems, was Sheik Speare. The authors suggest that Moammer said this jokingly, but I have heard from a reliable source that he was dead serious. The man does not joke."
3,For beginners without rentals only!,"Rating for beginners: 4Rating for others: 3This author goes through the motions on what you can expect from running a rental property. As the title indicates, his focus is on maximizing profits. Of course, the tradeoff is greater time outlay on the landlord's part.If you're just starting to consider landlording and don't own any properties, this book isn't a bad starting point but much of it is common sense.A better addition to your library would be ""Property Management for Dummies"". It is more complete and a great source for all levels of landlords (newbies on up). The Dummies' author, Robert S. Griswold, covers all the subject matter in Perry's book plus insurance, evictions, and other lawsuits in greater detail with more graphs and charts to illustrate the author's points."
3,Luke Warm Romance,I have enjoyed Brown's books in the past and while I didn't dislike this book the romance between the two main characters was luke warm. The idea for the story was great. It's about two people who inherit a house on the condition that they both live there and write a book each within 6 months then throw in a couple of ghost's (a regular feature of many of Brown's stories) and lot's of relatives. All this makes for a great read but this book just lacked the humour of her previous stories. If you have enjoyed her work previously still read this book but don't buy it new.
3,upper part too narrow,"Not very satisfied with it. Because the upper part is too narrow. I changed to a bigger size, but it didn't work better.It may fit other people."
3,less boot...same price.,i bought this same boot for work last year and the damm boot this year...exact same boot ...is now shorter! not as high up the leg...but still vharging the same price.! so long sorel.
2,Nice Looking but....,"The boot would not stay zipped and after two hours of snow tubing, I struggled to keep the boot on."
2,Disappointed with Amazon!,"EDIT (read my initial review below): I ordered one size up and got shockingly worn in, poor quality shoes. The suede on top is tattered and creased. There are blotchy spots on it as well. I'm terribly disappointed with Amazon. Returning these as well. I think I'll go to a real shoe store now.On the whole very good deal for the price: very comfortable, good sole and nice furry lining BUT runs terribly small. I'm returning mine. Order a full size larger to wear with thin socks or 1.5 larger for thicker socks. Shaft is very narrow, works for me, but may not for people with fuller calves."
5,His best work yet,This album has to be the best work I have heard from Brian harvey.So anyone out there who likes R'n'B buy this album I'm sure you will be plesantly surprised.if you don't it get you will be the one who loses out. It is fanastic.
4,Nothing to warn you that you can kill your tree!,"I agree with other reviews that there is a lot more to the setup than instructions provide. One very important detail is that if you wrap something tight and abrasive around a tree limb it will eventually cut through the bark and destroy the outer most ring. If this happens the limb will die. Instead, use a steel bracket with 2, 1/2"" holes, pre-drill with a 7/16"" blade bit, and secure with 1/2"" x 6"" lag bolts. This setup can hold 1000 lbs+ and is the method I used to build my tree house"
4,Pricey Fun,"We bought this for our 8 year old daughter this Christmas. She is having a great time with it, as are the neighbors' kids. I gave it only four stars due to the price. We still can't understand why a plastic handle grip and a length of wire costs $100. Plus, my husband spent an additional $50 on lumber to build the kids a sturdy platform to take off from. But, we spent it and we are enjoying it. We do not have it extended the full 70 feet, but the kids are getting a great ride at 40 feet anyway. Recommended if you want to spend the money."
5,LOVE IT!,we gave this to our children last year for christmas. they absolutely love it! even the adults :) its safe and easy! we have it going from one big tree to another! my husband built a wooden platform to climb up to it!
1,Bad quality,"This product broke after only two weeks of use. The bearings are completely worn out even though we followed all instructions and my children, 9 and 6 years old are far below the recommended weight limit. I would not recommend this product at all."
2,"For 80 sum bucks, not too much bang for your buck!!",The zipline is ok. Hard to get the cable exactly where it needs to be in order to slide. Directions are not easy. My son spend his birthday money on this item. I know he's disappointed in it. He was so excited to get it up and running.
4,not bad for the money,"I set up this product between 2 trees in my heavily wooded backyard with the 70 foot cable. It has held up pretty good now for over a year with lots of kids on it. I think the limit says 225 lbs but I wouldn't have more than about a 100 lb kid on it just to be safe. A 225 lb kid would break the line or drag it down to the ground first LOL....The rollers and plastic of the grab handle are holding up good so I feel I got my money's worth. It took me only a couple of hours to set up and I advise to put the cable as high as is safe for kids to climb up a tree and get to it, 12-15 ft or so. Heavier kids will have their feet dragging the ground if you don't do this and that's not much fun. When it hits the stop at the end some younger kids can lose grip and fall at that point so have an adult or older kid be ready to catch them at the end. Keeps the kids occupied"
4,Grand Fun,"I bought this for my mother's backyard for my niece (6). She desperately wanted one. The upshot is, EVERYONE loved it. Now everyone from my two-year-old daughter to six-grade tutoring students wait in line to take their turns at the zip line. I don't know how easy it is to install as my husband did it but it took only a few hours. As a matter of fact, we loved it so much that we installed one in our back yard for my daughter. And yes, my husband (who is not light) rides on it too."
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,"I think this product needs a LOT of hands-on supervision. My son slipped off and knocked the wind out himself TWICE on the 2nd day of trying this. After a couple of weeks, he finally regained his confidence to try it when a friend was over -- and his 6 y.o. friend slipped and knocked the wind out of herself (almost had to call the paramedics). Knowing what I know now... I would NOT buy this product for kids under 8 (follow the age recommendations!!!!!). I would like to take a pair of wire cutters and cut it down...."
3,Kids love it!,Overall I'm satisfied with the product and the kids love it!Reason for the low rating is you're getting about $25 worth of parts for a hundred bucks!
3,Does the job,"This product is good quality and not difficult to install. You have to be careful about the size of the tree used on both ends. If the diameter is too large, you will need another part ordered separately."
4,Spring Swings Deluxe,"This is a fun product. The handles are not comfortable. You really need to watch the kids on it. If you don't have the perfect set up, two strong trees in a cleared area, then you need to build a support for one or both sides."
3,"As advertisted, and pretty darn dangerous","There's not much to say:1) It's cheaply made, but for all that it's a sturdy product for the usage.2) The kids love it! It's great fun!3) My boy broke his arm, and now the whole kit is in a box stored in a box for the next 5 years."
2,Trolley broke after 1 week,"Initially this kit appeared to have all that we need. Right off the bat the cable sling that comes with the kit was not large enough for a medium-sized tree. I had to purchase more cable to make a loop. Next, the turnbuckle configuration does not make it nearly tight enough. You need to borrow (or purchase) a come-a-long AND a wire grip to pull it taut.After these extras were were zipping away. We added a seat jut by tying a disc swing onto the trolley. A bungee brake also made it a lot more safe and fun. We had lots of fun for a week...Then the sad news. With not even daily use the plastic trolley broke. The wheels are made of plastic as well. I now have to purchase a new trolley with steel wheels and bearings and I feel like a sucker. Save yourself some trouble and get a better kit from a website that specializes in zip lines or research better than I did and get the parts on Amazon separately."
4,Interesting and readable,"Surprisingly compelling account of the failure of the US military to prepare for future conflicts. I say ""surprising"" because the book contains little in the way of exciting futuristic technology, but lots of descriptions of bureaucratic resistance. Particularly interesting are the inside descriptions of absurd interservice rivalry."
4,Great for the price but a bit small,"I've had this for about a year now. I can't figure out how to temper chocolate to save my life so I just melt my chocolate in this little contraption and it works well for all my needs. It melts quickly. It cleans up nicely. But when I'm dipping a couple dozen shortbread cookies or some cakeballs, I have to continually put more chocolate in but like I said, it melts quickly so it's not too bad. It would make a great gift. I've melted milk, dark & white chocolate in this as well as Wilton Candy Melts. The nicest thing about this is that the chocolate stays melted & warm as you work. I used to melt my chocolate in a Pyrex bowl in the microwave but it would not stay melted as I worked and I had to continually remelt it. This is definitely worth the price."
5,Great Idea!,"I gave this as a gift and they loved it. They use it all the time, making candy and fondue is a fave!! This was a very good buy!!"
4,not appropriate for Australian consumers,You can not use this product in Australia as we have the wrong voltage and you would have to purchase a converter which would cost more than the product.A dud for us.
4,works great!,I use this to dip cake pops and it works just perfect!! My only complaint is that the handle bends easily while im hand washing it but its simple to bend back into place. Ive been using for a few months now very often!! At least once a week :) i love it!
2,cheap products,"aluminum is not the best utensil, so dont waste you money in thisalthough it does melt the chocolate you might as well do it on a double boiler on the stove"
3,Poor Packaging,"The product itself seems okay. Its a Christmas gift so it hasn't been used yet, however it arrived in a box that had clearly been opened before. It was likely crushed under other products. The box was torn and caving in on almost all sides. Not too impressed. Luckily, the box isn't the product so we'll see how that turns out. Just isn't great when giving something like this as a gift."
4,Practical and Doable Advice,"To get into the spirit of things, Dr. Goodman starts with a discussion of the lifestyle and credentials of consultants. The energetic and informative way he talks about it is contageous. He does not ignore the downside (every worthwhile venture has one) but he is enthusiastic in talking about all the advantages associated with the work.From this initial foundation he goes on to talk about marketing one's skills is which perhaps the major challenge faced by consultants new to the enterprise. He offers a number of options on getting one's name known.This is a book for serious, hands-on people who want to enter the field. For veterans it is a useful reference book. I recommend it highly."
2,So-so,There are better quit smoking references out there. I don't think the author should have started out with how hard it is to quit smoking. I had more cravings while reading those chapters than during my first week quit.I give 2 stars only because it is accurate in the fact of the body fat/carb chemistry changing.
4,Very Good for the Price,"I have used Adobe video programs for years, e.g. Premiere and After Effects, and found them pretty bullet-proof, albeit expensive. I have used this product for a couple of months (to avoid Adobe's frequent and expensive upgrades), creating a few short animations. So far a few glitches (and workarounds), but pretty good, especially for the price. I have spent almost all my time in the editing tab, especially the timeline view (the most detailed), and found everythng I expected - 16 tracks that can handle video and/or audio clips (multiples of each on any track), effects, titles, transitions, nice audio location (sync), etc. So I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a bargain video editing application. Be sure to download the latest patch, and check out the user forum at the Magix website for more feedback. And BTW, reportedly V.10 had/has problems, so get this V.11."
1,No customer support,I would NOT buy this product at all. They have no product support that will efficiently help you. I have left 6 messages over the last week to 3 different locations and have not gotten a return phone call. I have written 3 emails to seperate people and have not gotten a return email. If you will require product support this is not the product to buy.
1,Crash and Burn!,"If you like cheap movie editing software that crashes and burns, this product is for you! Unfortunately I bought this product at Best Buy since it was on sale for $20 without seeing any reviews first. Big Mistake! It crashed on install. It crashes when selecting various options. The customer support is TERRIBLE. Their Website is terrible! I have a pretty high tech machine so I know it is not my computer. I've got all the latest drivers and downloaded their useless patch. I think I will move up to Sony's Vegas Movie Studio. I have seen a lot of good reviews on that product! For now it might be back to Windows Movie Maker. To bad you can not return opened software. DO NOT BUY THIS!! You'll be sorry."
1,Frustrating and Useless,"Bought this product based on my total disgust with two other programs which I felt didn't give me enough power in editing. As it turns out, despite the number of tools available with this product, it is incredibly frustrating and non-intuitive. The manual is useless and the help files equally as unhelpful. The program is highly crash prone and the quality of the finished product is shoddy. Buyer beware!"
1,Misleading packaging,"I do not recommend purchasing Magix products.I bought this software because my video camera records in Dolby 5.1 surround and the Magix packaging claimed it supported surround sound. After unsuccessfully burning DVD's with surround sound (in fact there was NO digital audio), I contacted customer support who told me the surround sound supported is not the Dolby standard and is only supported by a few DVD brands. When I attempted to get a refund due to inadequate packaging, they preferred to argue with me rather than support me.Fortunately, the retailer agreed with me and provided the refund (thanks Amazon!!!) I am now using Sony Vegas Platinum 7 and it does everything I need."
3,Not what I expected,"I own many books on color and this one is honestly not one of my favorites. It's not that there's anything that I disliked in particular, but there are other books out there that do a much better job addressing this topic."
1,Look elsewhere,"This is not a practical holster: it is difficult to put the phone in and out, it doesn't change the mode so your phone is still active in the holster. It is not very sturdy plastic, and the piece that holds the phone on top seems like it will break any time. I wont return it only because shipping would cost more than this holster, but I found the ""NEW OEM Holster Swivel BlackBerry 8700g 8700c 8703e"" better, even if it still is a bit tricky getting the phone out of it."
1,Total piece of JUNK! 1 Star is too high a rating!,"Whoever designed this thing obviously does not have children. I would give it 0 stars if that were an option. The frame on the bed rail has exposed hard plastic pieces. Additionally, the steel tube/rails are covered only with a thin piece of nylon. Does anyone at Safety 1st realize that kids roll around while sleeping?!?!? This means that they will inevitably hit the bed rails, often with their heads. Without any soft padding, that means they will 1) wake themselves up, and/or 2) hurt themselves. Also, the rail is at least 6 inches too short and 3 inches too low to be of real value. Safety 1st really needs to fire the moron who designed this useless thing."
3,I used this with a toddler bed anyway....,"This is the only rail that is short enough to use with a toddler bed and still leave a small opening for my daughter to climb out on her own. It was against the directions, but I felt it to be safe, and never had any saftey problems AT ALL. Although the rail DOES make the bed narrower, it is certainly tall enough to prevent my daughter from falling out of the bed. I don't even see the purpose to have one any taller....may as well use a crib if you want this rail to prevent your child from climbing out. It is very secure and very safe. I don't know what the other people were talking about when they said that it ""unlocked"" This has never happened to me and I had it9 months. My daughter is now in a twin size bed and I'm still using this rail since it is small and white, not blue and ugly like the other ones on the market. My main complaint is that it does not fold down, so you have to remove it to make the bed."
1,Junk,"I just bought this today and it is going right back to the store. I cannot get it to lock in the ""lock"" position and each time I press on the top it slides down. Not too safe if it is my child leaning on it. Also it says not to use on a toddler bed, which is exactly what I bought it for, because HELLO!!! the picture shows it being used with a toddler bed. It wasn't until I put it all together and saw the warning that I realized I should not be using it on a toddler bed. So back to the store it goes!!!"
1,terrible design,"This is the worst bed rail. The design of having it sit on top of the mattress cuts into the sleeping area of the child hence allowing the child to hit his/her head on the (huge) plastic end. It is very hard to get into the ""lock"" position and sticks way out when folded down.Not worth the $30 charge - I returned it the day after I bought it"
5,"My Grace , Music from her heart.","This CD is great, with urban beats to it. A woman with such a beautiful voice.I usally don't listen to Gospel Music, but to hear Sharon's CD I recommend that everyone get it. Sharon Good Luck on your new success."
2,Meh,"I liked the idea, but it wasn't pulled off well. The ring is cool looking, and the thought when ordering it was that I'd place it on between two silver swirl bands I already have. But the ring is bulky. And it's not stretch at all and I have BIG hands. Matter of fact, it's too big and doesn't fit tight to my finger at all, so I'd need my swirl band to keep it on my finger anyway. But I do love the stones in it, and for what I paid for it, I'm not upset. It is what it is."
5,Great book!,This book gives a fairly good insight for expanding the concept of UML designs and notations for more practical framework approaches.
2,Not very inspiring,A tough book to get through. Not incredibly inspiring. Only some useful information couched by a hundred pages of denominational-slanted work in CE.
4,Strong Theological Foundation for Lutheran Education,"Prepared by the Christian Education professors of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, this volume provides a solid, approachable theological foundation for christian education. This book is not so much a pragmatic ""how to"" manual. This book also does not outline a program or model for implementing programs of children's christian education in a parish. What this book DOES is provide theological, theoretical explanations of principles that under-gird ministry of education. It is a real gift to provide short essay-length theological considerations for CE. For pastors, seminarians, Directors of Christian Education, Sunday School workers, and people involved in education, at least in Lutheran congregations, should read this book."
4,Good work on the Poe-Hart Gang,"This is a small book, which concentrates on a little known gang of bandits that terrorized Oklahoma. It is the first major study on this subject matter that I am aware of and is well-researched and written. There are several documents and photo's in the book, which are being presented for the first time. If you like reading about desperate men, then ""Desperadoes: The Rise and Fall of the Poe-Hart Gang"" will fill this void.Mike Koch, author of ""The Kimes Gang."""
4,wesico slayers,the book is fun to play if u can get the right group togetherit has a few typeos in it but its ok 4 the most part
2,Without Research,"Okay, it's an interesting game source, but honestly, I could have written the thing better myself. My major concern is that there's absolutely no research in the book beyond just watching the damned show: apparently they missed the movie, because they think elves aren't a character race. And dwarves obviously exist, despite that they don't allow THOSE as a character race either.It's nice to have stats for all the Slayers characters, but these stats are BS. Look: The Slayers characters are epic. Instead of trying to restructure the system so Amelia's 17th level and Lina's only 19th, they should have just worked with the epic system."
5,Great Shot!,"Wow! This slingshot is great! It takes a little time to get used to aiming, but other than that it's great! We already nailed 5 cans and shattered 2 glass bottles. I also like how it comes with free ammunition. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes exciting high quality slingshots! (This was written by an 11-year-old boy)"
3,Not bad...,"The slingshot works alright. I've realized that home made slingshots can be customized more to your liking. The bands I feel are too short and stiff without much give allowing for a smoother follow through after a shot. Overall, it's excellent for pure fun! Be safe!"
4,Very good,This has been a very well made slingshot so far. My son has used it several times and it is still holding up well. I didn't think slingshots held together anymore so I was very Leary about buying one. Glad I took a chance with this one.
5,Bullzeye,"""You'll shoot your eye out kid"". That's how good this thing is. Just be careful you don't pinch your hand where the wrist guard comes in contact with the handle. it will hurt."
5,Great Toy,"Slingshots have come a long way since I was a kid,and this one makes plinking around fun,and it helps pass the time,great price too."
2,BAD FROM THE FACTORY,"The BlackWidow sling shot looked find when it came, but within a few days one side of the ""rubber"" was considerably longer than the other. Within a week it broke on the lengthened side. This sort or stuff happens so I prepared to send it back by reading the return rules from Datavision Computer Video (yes, I thought it was a strange item for a computer/video company to handle when I bought it, but they had good reviews). Datavision's return policy is geared toward high dollar items and is absurd for low cost items (all items are returned at the buyer's expense and must be insured). This would cost more than the item. I did reorder the sling shot from another company with a no cost return policy, and it seems to be fine. Read the fine print on the return policy - particularly on low cost items - regardless of the company rating."
2,Leather easily breaks,"We bought 12 of these slingshots to play paintball with for a party. By the end of the day, every slingshot had at least some duct tape around the leather strap that holds the ammunition. The leather is very weak and broke after a seemingly insignificant number of shots, and if it didn't break at the connection to the rubber, then it tore in half. Would not recommend."
5,Good for beginner.,"I am a beginner at slingshot and this is my first. I find it very easy to pull back and I got the hang of it within minutes. It seems to be pretty powerful, however I cannot compare it to anything. The metal round that go with this work great. I haven't had a problem with the pocket breaking after over 100 shots. It is very small, which I love since I have a small hand. The wrist brace is small to get your hand through, so those of you with a big hand may have trouble. The wrist brace works great and gives me a lot of support. I like how it folds. This is a easy slingshot to learn on in my opinion and I love it."
2,Mediocre at best,The plastic handle opens at the seam when flexed (as in when pulling back the sling) and tends to pinch the hand. And the pocket is not well formed and does not capture the ammo well.
3,It came... but 2 days later it broke,I like the slingshot but it broke after 3 days!!!! i ordered a new elastic and it came... but i am mad that i spent 10-15 dollars on a thing that broke after a couple days!! The elastic didnt break but the leather did
5,The Patchwork Pocket Palette,Great little book at a very reasonable price. Photos very helpful in seeking out different colour perspectives....not only useful in my quilting but my photographer husband also took a glance at it.
2,little boring,"While this is supposed to be one of the great expressionism films of the early 20th century, I found this one somewhat dull and the premise out dated. The movie takes advantage of the early interest in psychoanalysis and is based on the premise that if the one repressed ""feeling"" is revealed in your tormented life you will live happily ever after (Even Hitchcock had trouble with this in ""Spellbound"").I bought this film as part of Kino's boxed set ""German Expressionism Collection,"" and its definitely the weakest of the four in the set. This film has very little entertainment value. Watch it as an example of expressionism films, but not if you are overly tired. And don't pay full price."
4,Pretty good,"These speakers are very nice, especially the subwoofer. The problem is that the satelites are too quiet and at medium volume, you can hear a very annoying static noise. Not very good for watching movies, but they are nice if you keep them quiet and crank up the subwoofer =)"
2,too much clutter,"These speakers are OK - the sound is fine. The annoying thing about them is that the volume control is a separate piece of equipment, like a small computer mouse that hooks into the subwoofer. It is very lightweight and flimsy, so every time you need to adjust the volume, it takes two hands - one to hold the thing down and the other to turn the nob. Really bad design. It also creates extra clutter on my desk with no added advantage."
2,Do Not Stand the Test of Time,"When I first purchased these at J&R, they seemed the best ""bang for the buck."" Crisp highs sold me despite the somewhat overpowering sub. Over time, I have gone from enjoying these speakers to not understanding why I ever purchased them. I'm not an audiophile, but even on my computer I'd like to hear what the musicians played. How nice to hear an ocassional midrange and a subwoofer that isn't just built for solid booms . Digital music is compressed enough; subpar speakers only make it worse. Is it possible they have decayed? I seem to recall hearing something better that day at J&R -- and later at home. Perhaps I was hearing a better set of speakers. I cannot wait to replace these."
1,"Good for the first time, and then . . .","I've had these for some time now. Initially, they were good, but then after awhile, I noticed that I've only been hearing sound coming from just one of the speakers. I thought it was one of the speakers, but I switched their connection on the subwoofer. It turns out it's the subwoofer. There is something wrong with the port for the left speaker since nothing comes out. I even used my sister's speaker and plugged it in this port, and still nothing comes out."
5,its a top people,"Lets face it if you reached the reviews that means you liked the style of the top, the only thing that should stop you from buying this item is if it falls apart on you which it does not. bought it for the wife and she loved it."
4,Fine book and sale,"Just what is being reviewed? The book arrived as advertised, my kid loved the book. Read it through start to finish."
4,"Excellent, Easily Installed Connectors",These connectors are easy to install on a range of cable gauges from lamp cord (if you must use it) up to hefty speaker cables. They are excellent for installations like home theater or two channel. They fit a range of amplifier ouputs and speaker inputs.Be sure to trim the ends of the cable before you install the plug.
4,Use with ProGold and silicon sealer,"The ""banana"" ends are very strong in that they expand and hold very well. As far as the oxidation argument is concerned, I just dapped on some ProGold and then shot some silicone sealer inside the ferrule around the wire."
5,QuickLock is a dream come true,I use these all the time because I use Monster Cable (the kind that is suppose to run through your walls) to get the most out of my Cerwin Vega speakers. The QuickLock is a dream come true and Monster always does a good job.
5,convenice at its best,"this is very convenient indeed. However, Im not entirely convinced over the price of this item, I think its bit over priced. If you are not gonna be disconnecting your system often, you could opt for the regular banana plugs and save some money which you would invest in cables."
1,monster is a advertising firm period,"Monster states that you need gold connectors cause copper corrodes, this is true. But they don't tell you that the same contact that was made between your speaker cable and speaker binding post is now taking place inside your new plug. Has monster some how defeated science and found a way to create an oxygen free environment inside their products that prevents corrosion and thereby signal loss. NO the only thing they have defeated is common sense. Put your cable in a good spade lug and drip some solder in the tip. Cheaper and scientifically better."
3,Overpriced,"I had these connectors in the past, just bought a new recevier and needed some new ones i went ahead and started searching for good banana plugs, i found cheaper ones that sound just as good as these ones.Overall the monsters ones are easy to install and are good quality but you can find cheaper ones of the same qualityGLS Audio Black Chrome Series ""Generation 4"" Gold Connector Banana Plugs Banana Clips - 20 Pack (10 Reds & 10 Blacks)."
5,"As always, perfect product",I have never been disappointed with Monster Cable brand electronics. Now if they could only lower those high prices.
5,Very good.,Very good plugs easy too use and they are monster as always a little expensive but worth the extra $.
5,Awesome Connectors!,"You get what you pay for..and these connectors prove it once again. I'm one who will pay a few extra bucks for something that is higher quality and heavy duty. These things are 100% in my books wouldn't change a thing. Picked up 2 sets of them for my 2.1 computer speaker set up. Buy a set, take a minute to connect them to your wires. Take 2 seconds to plug them in and you'll see how nice these are! Highly recommend these!"
3,Overpriced but convenient,"Very easy to use but overpriced, however there is not much else out there with similar design. Radio Shack carries similar banana plugs, but they cost only a couple of dollars less.Obviously, sound quality wise these are not any better than $1 banana plugs where you have to tighten the screws, the question to ask is whether the convenience is worth $$ to you.Three stars only because they are overpriced, if they were $10, I would have given them 5 stars."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I wish I would have known that this Boppy doesn't have a removable slipcover before I registered for it and received it as a gift. It is washable, but it would be much nicer to be able to just zip the cover off and toss it in the wash instead of washing the whole pillow. The fabric is cute and gender neutral, but it's not super soft. I will probably end up getting a Bare Naked Boppy and a few luxe slipcovers and just use this one on occasion."
4,I only have one complaint.,"I bought this for my nook first edition when I was tired of keeping it in a weird foam pouch I found online a million years ago.I really liked the look of having a ""leather""ish case. I have only one complaint, and that is the latch that closes it, is on the back and it still (5 months later) tricks me and I open it backwards."
4,Get one.,"I don't believe this is real leather but it's close enough for me. The case is attractive, functional in that it protects and stores the nook very nicely and, further, it fits like a glove. I'm happy I bought it."
3,ok for the money,This looks good from a far but cheap and plastic close up. The middle binding will start to crack if you bend it over itself while reading. It also took about 2 weeks to arrive... I wasn't thrilled about that. It will serve the purpose of keeping the nook from taking abuse but I'm unsure how long it will last.
4,High Quality,Been using this case for over 6th months now and it still looks great. However I did notice my nook has been stained by the back of the case (small marks on white backing of the nook). Not a big deal but it seems like they could have chosen a better material to prevent that from happening. Overall it is high quality product and hold the nook perfectly.
2,Will NOT fit Nookcolor!,"Sadly, did not read specifics before buying. Found that it is NOT real leather and will not fit the new Nookcolor. For a regular Nook synthetic cover I suppose it's ok."
3,Case does not fit the Nook Color as advertised,The case does not fit the nook color and I contacted the company to exchange it with no results so far.
3,A (mostly) great cover for my Nook,"This cover works great for my Nook. I didn't like any of the covers at Barnes & Noble (and they were all much more expensive), so I decided to try a third-party cover. I like this one because it feels great in the hand and holds the Nook securely while still giving access to the touchscreen and ports. I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this cover.**EDIT** After having the cover for a month or so, I've noticed that the back of my Nook looks dirty. The color from the suede backing of the cover has left marks on the Nook's back. (I have the white-backed Nook Wi-Fi, so it's probably more noticeable on mine than on the Nook 3G.) It's not a huge deal since the marks are on the back of the device, but this is presumably the hidden cost of a cheaper cover."
1,Should have listeded to reviews!,"NOT real leather and this thing stinks like you would not believe. I have washed it with soap and water, cleaners and sprayed cologne on this and the foul stentch keeps coming back. Discolored the back of my brand NEW white NOOK. Complete was of money."
4,Nice and simple-looking Nook case!,"After researching through many Nook cases, I came across these and they are perfect! I was looking for something simple and cheaper than B&N;'s covers, and these fit the bill! Nice leather case, good fit, lightweight, magnetic clasp on the backcover, soft interior, good value and nice look for the Nook! Excellent buy and good service from BoxWave!EDIT: As other reviewers have mentioned, after a few months of use, their are black marks left on the back of the Nook from the case. Not a big deal to me, but it would be if you ever wanted to sell the Nook! Also, the outside cover is prone to scratches easily and it does show with the sienna brown leather, but I actually think it gives it character like a worn leather book so I don't really mind. Other than that, the case is still lasting in good condition!"
1,do research first,"while case is advertised as to be for nookcolor DOES NOT FIT NOOK COLOR. TOO SHORT.about a 16th of an inch too short, nookcolor too big won't fit in holder properlydont buy"
2,Not so great :(,I loved the idea about the wand sticking to the lid....yep it does not stay on at all. Plus the bubble solution gets everywhere. Very disappointed with this purchase.
2,I'll leave it!,"Nice and thick,makes for good bubbles. I purchased with Gazillion Bubble Machin,was very dissapointed with machine so I sold this off with machine shortly thereafter."
2,Pretty weak,"Someone was having a good time fiddling with the special effects, making this appear to be 50s sock hop meets 60s psychedelia. That and some of the laughable outfits (why must overweight women wear tight clothing?) make it pretty weak. Occasionally when the editor gets tired of fiddling, there is some good highlighting of standard box steps. So I wouldn't buy this tape. However... I did like the Webb's 3-video instructional swing tapes. They really teach and do so at a good pace (while the amateurishness of the production provides some good laughs). The only thing to be careful of in their instructional videos is that the ""jitterbug"" is some sort of two-step. However, we've found that we can ""translate"" two-step to one-step. We like the Webb's tapes better than Teresa Mason. They aren't as fluid as her and her partner, but they do a significantly better job of teaching."
2,"Not an instruction tape, but a display of various techniques","For the price of $4.99, not too bad. First part is slow, with too much special effects, but it picks up pretty well. about 30 minutes. Music is OK, and dancers make no attempt to be instructors. Good quality video, and interesting to watch for style."
4,For fun viewing,"For a delivered cost of $8 or $9, this is a worthwhile purchase if you enjoy watching excellent dancers perform. Both my ladyfriend and I, who are just learning swing (beginners), will enjoy watching this tape again and again, and I am sure we will be able to improvise some moves based on the quick glimpses of advanced moves the dancers demonstrated. This is not, however, a 'how to' tape."
3,Average Effort,"This is a light coffee table book that provides a kind of greatest hits list of the collection. A collection that is so big no one single book would really do it justice. Overall I think this book does a fine job at its purpose, which is to provide you a little history and meaning on some selected works. This book is almost akin to a travel memento picture book. The book for me reminds me to always stop by the Museum when I am in Paris"
5,Easy setup,"We used this for a camping trip. The ease in which is sets up is amazing. No bugs got through. The rainfly was not needed but is easy to put on. The bar down teh middle is a distraction, but not a ""show stopper"". It's lightweight design means that it would be a good idea to secure it during high winds. I tied it to the bumper of my truck."
3,better than a tent,"This is a great product. It sets up faster than a tent and it is comfy to sleep in. but they could have done a better job with ventilation. There should be some open vent area with some netting on the top kind of like a regular tent but there is none. This makes the inside build up humidity and especially in a cold day you will have a lot of condensation on the walls. In fact, it will get really wet. Other than that the double is very heavy and bulky to carry in the car."
3,Kamp-Rite Double Tent Cot,"If you purchase this product and plan to use it in cold or rainy weather where the rainfly is required, be aware that there is absolutely no ventilation with both the tent and rainfly closed. We camped in below freezing weather with the tent and rainfly all closed and woke gasping for air and feeling as if we were being asphixiated. We had to leave the rain fly off, both side door vents open and side vents partly unzipped to avoid this and to avoid extreme condensation leaving the tent dripping with moisture from our breathing. It was a frightening experience and we have tent camped for many years and never had this happen with another tent. We like the tent and the comfort of sleeping, as long as you use a firm pad to keep the sleeping surface relatively firm. We will continue to use the tent and will make modifications in venting to prevent the serious, frightening problems we had the first night we used it."
5,The most definitive Pooh audio books ever!,"This is THE audio book collection to have to fully appreciate the English A.A. Milne stories in all its gentle ironies, witty humour, characterisations etc. There is so much wealth in the original stories and the performance by the excellent well-directed cast truly brings the stories to life and does the stories justice. The most important thing is: they are so entertaining that parents will never tire of listening to the stories while the kids are totally absorbed and tickled. The CDs are full of songs with clever tunes that are often sung by the kids (and parents) with great enjoyment. This is most suitable for you especially if the limited Disney portrayal leaves you cold."
4,Summer of fun,"I always read the bad reviews before I buy a novel now. They really tell you what there is to like and not like about a story from a different point of view. So I have to say that I somewhat agree with be bad reviews of this book. The ending was not what I expected. That part of the plot she could have left out. Also there were a few words in the novel that just felt out of place, but since Karen Robards is a historical writer as well, I will give her a pass. I really loved this book however. It was great. The few criticisms I have don't take away from this great story one bit. It was romantic and suspenseful and fun. Sure Johnny was a stereotype right out of Dirty Dancing or Grease, but if you like those stories then you&#65533;ll love this one too. The Four stars is only because of the ending where I detect a bit of author meddling. I won't give it away except to say that it was very convenient. Otherwise the book was just plain fun and I was sad when it was over."
5,Great story!,"Johnny Harris is considered ""trash"" by the people of town. When he is convicted of murder, on very little evidence, most people see it as no more than could be expected out of ""his kind"". But Rachel Grant, who always does the proper thing, never believed in his guilt. As his ex-teacher she saw a side of Johnny that others never did.When Johnny comes home he's belligerent and angry. He's also as hooked on Rachel as he has been for half of his life but feels she could never be happy with a guy like him. It's both heartbreaking and heartwarming to watch these two try to overcome the differences in their personalities and life styles to be together.Granted there wasn't much murder mystery involved but it wasn't needed with the rest of this encouraging love story."
2,Unrealistic.......,"This novel was about a teacher (Rachel Grant) who believed her bad-boy student (Johnny Harris) was wrongly convicted of raping and murdering his girlfriend. After serving 10 years in prison, Rachel is Johnny's only ally. The story revolves around the relationship between these two characters and the mystery surrounding Johnny Harris's innocence. I felt both the romance & suspense aspects of this story were far-fetched.I enjoy Robard's historical books much more than her contemporaries. With that being said, this novel held my interest, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is looking for a knockout."
3,One Summer,It was interesting and keep my interest and had a surprise ending one I didnt figure out. It is an older book by the author and I know some of it seems dated and if she wrote it today it would have a little different contents.
5,Breathtaking Romance!,"Granted, as far as the mystery goes, there isn't much appeal in this book. I would suggest people read this book for the romance, adventure, writing and the protagonists.Even when the villian is revealed and the mystery seems implausible, the writing is so tight, that it will keep you on the edge.And the romance...so very, very endearing, with a ""to die for"" hero.The subtle paranormal aspects were quite intriguing.Five stars!"
4,WOW!,"I enjoyed this book VERY MUCH! It had a lot of hot scenes along with a plot, climax, and it was an all around thriller! It had enough of everything to keep me intrigued! A true page-turner!!!"
5,I love this book so much I bought it twice.,I got this book from the library when it first came out and loved it so much I bought it. I lent it out and never got it back. So now 8 years later it's still popping into my head and had to buy it again. Johnny Harris and Rachel Grant touched my heart and they haven't let go. Don't listen to the people who say that the book is a little implausible. It's fiction for God's sake and it's the authors right to twist the plausible for the sake of the story and the story rocks.
2,Dull Mission for the Killmaster,"Carter is in the Mideast trying to find out who is mobilizing Muslims against the West. Unfortunately,action is set aside so Carter can trade quips and bed down a KGB spy he's on friendly terms with. Yawn!"
2,"Better than average, but that's all","I tried this shampoo because my hair was dry and damaged after straightening. It was better than a regular, everyday shampoo, but not as good as the Garnier Fructis line, which costs much less.The problem with all so-called ""conditioning"" shampoos (and almost all shampoos, period) is that they contain sulfates. Sulfates strip your hair, to some degree or another. Even most of the shampoos out now claiming to be ""sulfate-free"" will in fact have a sulfate ingredient when you read the label.By far the best product I've found to clean hair without stripping is called Shea Moisture. They have 3 types of shampoo & conditioner, and a few other products. I believe they are currently only available at select Targets. Maybe that will change. But at $10 a bottle, it is the best investment you'll make for damaged hair."
2,"No, This One`s For The Collector-Fans Only!","I am a huge Sex Pistols fan, myself, and I am sad to say that this is one of the worst complications I`ve ever heard with them , except for the awful Live-Albums... The sound-quality is so poor, that I don`t know how you can ever mix this sound into a Long-Play-CD... For new listeners; Keep away from this... And the ""Karaoke-Track"" is not an original thing: They have just cut off Johnny Rotten`s voice! This is Swindle For All The Money!!! (And from what Bootleg is the Sweden-Tour taken from???)"
2,Ephemera for serious Sex Pistols fanatics only.,"The 22 tracks (45+ minutes) are a very uneven assortment of outtakes, interviews, some live material, etc. The Australian TV advertisement and some of the interviews can best be classified as throwaways. Most of the tracks are familiar with only one or two obscure tracks: Schools are Prisons; Watcha Gonna Do About It. For you karaoke fans, track eight is the backing track (no vocals) for Pretty Vacant. The packaging is low budget as well, with scant liner notes. To sum it up, the warning on the back says it all: Caveat Emptor - Let the Buyer Beware! Recording quality is suspect.Castle Communications could have done a much better job with this one. With a little more effort they could have ensured that whoever bought this CD doesn't immediately feel as if they have been fleeced. The Swindle continues."
2,NB: There's still a good reason to buy this...,"And that is the song ""Schools Are Prisons,"" which disproves once and for all one of rock's biggest myths: That the Sex Pistols couldn't play their instruments (In truth, they just didn't try to). There's something (very) vaguely Stooges about this song, and you can clearly see Public Image Ltd. in it as well. The rest is pretty horrible. If you REALLY want demos, live performnaces, etc. wait for the Boxset to come out in... uh... June, is it? Too bad it doesn't have ""Schools..."""
3,"Pirates of Destiny - demos, outakes and speeches!","The album is strictly for sex pistols fans. It contains an advertisement from the australian t.v., several words from lyndon and mclaren , which are very bad quality. It has a speech give by the GLC British Couselor on punk rock and the sex pistols ( as seen in the film "" the great rock and roll swindle""), ""No feelings"" and ""Problems"" comes from the spunk sessions, and arent EXCELLENT quality, but rather good. The outstanding track is ""Schools are Prisions"", which is only found in this record. ""Woodstock Baby"" is actually an intro for an early version of ""Anarchy in the U.K."". The tracks "" I wanna be me"" and ""Lazy Sod"" are live in sweden, July 28, 1977. ""Through my Eyes"" is an old demo, a cover from the Small Faces. The last track is ""Lazy Sod"" live in the secret tour around England, late 1977. Just for real fans."
4,Common Mistake,"I'm not going to do an actual review of the album, however I am going to make something quite clear. The reason why you can only find 'schools are prisons' on this album is becuase 'schools are prisons' is NOT a sex pistols song. In fact, half of the album is NOT sex pistols. (...)The track was recorded during the recording session for the Sexless Pistols - Deny LPThe band comprized of people like Matlock, Goodman and McIntosh..However do note that most of the songs on the ablum are the sex pistols. It's just that that song and perhaps one or two others are not.Just wanted to make that clear."
3,Long gone are the uplifting lyrics of 3.V,"What the hell has happened to one of my favorite bands?One thing I really liked about Zebra was their uplifting lyrics, the bright, polished sound of 3.V is long gone. This album's morbid sense of pessimism is illogically placed.Don't get me wrong, this is a good album in a lot of aspects, but the preachy ""anti religion"" themes of many of these songs weigh this album down.Bright spots:""Arabian Nights"" - a MASTERPIECE!""K.K. is Hiding"" - A kick ... song with a cutesy theme.""Free"" - an older tune that has FINALLY found its way into the studio.""My Life Has Changed"" - Another GREAT tune that should have replaced some of the fluff on older albums.""So I Dance"" - A tongue in cheek, Beatlesque tune. Will prolly get old soon, but makes a good listen for now.Just a note to bands in general - keep the religion and politics out of the music. ENTERTAIN us, don't tell us what we should or shouldn't believe."
4,Missing the point......,"People reviewing this album on its musical merits alone are missing the point. Back in the mid 80's when so called 'hair bands' ruled radio these guys got very little air or MTV play, nor were they a 'hair band'. They always came on stage in t-shirts, jeans and sneakers like their fans. That notwithstanding these guys could have taken Atlantic's $$$, churned out some records, did the tour thing, and been on ""Where Are They Now"" or ""I Love the 80's"". Instead, they opted to remain true to what they wanted to do, play music.I've seen them live and they are real people with a real passion to play for real people! If you like the other Zebra cd's you will like this one, as well. Not only are these guys great musicians, they are great people! I hope they rock until their in their 90's! See them live if you can. You won't be disappointed."
1,Way out of date,"I'm sure that this book was helpful 10 years ago when people were trying to figure out if the web was going to be a viable sales venue but not so much anymore. This isn't to say anything about the writing or information quality, just the timeliness of it."
2,"Great concept, poor results",I great idea if it stayed sharp! The insul-knife isn't sharp to begin with & dulls even more soon after. It cuts the first couple of batts with ease then is useless. You have to sharpen it constantly which is to much of a hassle. If the blade was sharp & hardened It would be a great tool to have!
1,USELESS TOOL-Save Your Money!!!,"If you are considering this tool for use on Ultra Touch insulation dont bother. The tool is absolutely useless for that application, maybe it works well on other ""conventional"" isulations but it does not work at all on the ultra touch material, you are better off using the standard utility knife (carefully) and straight edge. If you are using Ultra Touch insulaion the best way to cut it is with a small Band Saw (maybe even an electric carving knife), anything else is just a compromise. I write this as I am finishing the insulation on a 20'x20' room, BTW the Ultra touch insulation is Excellent, very happy with it."
2,Excellent after a little tweaking,"As the knife comes from the factory it is extremely difficult to use. It is not sharp enough to cut foam thicker than 1"", and it is extremely hard to push the blade through thicker foam without crushing, rather than cutting the foam. I purchased a good ceramic rod knife sharpener and sharpened the blade. This was much better but it was still very difficult to cut thick foam because of the friction of the huge blade sliding against the foam being cut. I sprayed the entire surface of the blade with silicone lubricant and this made an almost magical difference. It was trivial to make very smooth cuts in foam 3"" to 4"" thick.For some reason the Amazon web page is not letting me set my star rating but I would give it a 5 (if Amazon would let me)."
4,descent product,Purchased these for my daughter's Dell laptops. Worked out real well and put a couple years more of service for these laptops.
3,Be careful about compatibility!,"I did not heed the warnings, and although this product functions, it doesn't work in a pair at full capacity. Seller was honest and the price was fair. I just gambled and came up short."
4,"Excellent book, a bit disappointed with the ending.","I was so excited to read this book that I spent an entire Sunday doing so. I did my exercises, rechecked my type, and definitely found a match. My only problem was that there wasn't a place to go from here. Ok, they list possible job types, but I need a way of getting even more specific. The job types listed ran a generally wide gammut. I was left feeling like, SO WHAT'S NEXT??"
2,"Good Personality Testing, but what's next?","The personality testing in this book is very interesting, but a single personality test does not necessarily reveal what a person's career should be. It only represents a slice of what a person really is. I found this book somewhat frustrating because after reading it, the reader has no idea where to go next."
3,Good as a starting point!,"Do What You Are is a good book to read at the beginning of your career search because it provides an idea of the types of jobs that you might be suited to. However, the lists of jobs that are assigned to the different personality types are good guides, but we have to be careful to not narrow down our choices to only those listed in the book. I feel that figuring out your career through personality testing in this way, may be a slightly simplified process, since not all individuals of a certain personality type may want to be say dentists or doctors etc (i.e. whatever is listed in the book).Nonetheless, I think this is a good starting point for someone who is not sure about what kinds of jobs they should look at. And I think the book is great for finding out more about yourself and the things you like and don't like."
5,None,"This is a great book that really gets you understanding your natural attitudes and tendencies and aptitude to succeed in certain environments. Be warned that it massively focuses on MyersBrigg personality codes, however it presents them better than you usually read elsewhere. Good for picking a college major or assessing career choices."
5,Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting an introduction to the MTBI. I hadnt read anything on the topic before, and it was a great way to start out. The subject and descriptions are very clear and straight to the point. Great book for some ""self realization/self analysis.""As a recent college graduate, I definitely plan on using this information in my job search. It confirmed to me that the field I am going for is the appropriate one, now it's time to get to work."
2,If You Know Yourself Well - Don't Get This Book,"I suppose if you have NO idea what your personality is, then this is a good book to get - out of the library! It's NOT the content or the way it was written (all that was fine). I just think buying this book was a waste of money (for me, at least) because #1) I already knew I wanted to something in a creative field - I didn't need the book to let me in on that pearl of wisdom and #2) once you know your personality type and read the list of careers you might fit into, you probably won't need to refer back to this book for anything. Also, I had the feeling the people they ""interviewed"" at the end were fictional - or at least that part was poorly written..."
