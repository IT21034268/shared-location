3,"Library, yes. Bookstore, no","If your child has the time, and they enjoyed the movie, then check the book out from the library; however, this is not a book they'll want to read over and over again. The book does not flow well, or make much sense if you have NOT seen the movie. The characters are neither developed nor believable; and there is absolutely no depth to the plot. If you have a horse lover, who may not be the best reader, I would recommend the Black Stallion series, the Sandy Lane Stable series, or the Thoroughbred series. These books may be a little more of a challenge for the casual reader, but your child will be more likely to pick up another book when they are done reading one of these."
2,Good for a diary; bad for a book,"The heart of the story is good -- it gives a touching glimpse into the life of someone living with cerebral palsy, and reading it certainly raised my awareness of not judging someone's mental capabilities by their physical limitations. Christy Brown was indeed an inspirational person who overcame a lot. However, Brown's writing style is simple and on the surface, lacking real depth and detail. He tries to be deep and intellectual at times, but it just comes off as overly dramatic and cheesy. It felt like I was reading a 13 year-old's diary...interesting enough stories within it, but not well-written at all. The only redeeming factor is that the book is short and a quick read. However, I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,"Good, but could have been so much more...","The clips were good, but too short. It didn't ""fill my appetite"" in seeing the retro clips.I did enjoy the ""easter egg"" of the gimmicks photo gallery, seeing all of the wrestlers from the ""federation"" era that didn't quite make it.Biggest thing that I noticed was that whenever the ""scratch"" WWF logo was shown, it was blurred out, but the older ""block"" WWF logo was left alone - that didn't make sense.I agree with others that it should have been a 2-disc set, basically to show the history of the nominees/matches/etc., rather than just the small clips that were shown. Hopefully they'll have more for a SD 10th Anniv. or RAW 20th. (if it happens...)"
3,a good proctuct for the history,"i would like to say tha this dvd is a must for every fan of the wwe , a 3 hours dvd with several extras and bonus , ijust got this one 2 days ago and it was very entertaining , but dont expect any surprise from this one because all good fan saw every and each one fo raw best moments :stone cold and his truck or dx and the rock but this dvd contains all the stuffs inside ,so just get it,3 hours man !!!!"
2,"Yeah, well, whatever","Ok, yeah I didn't buy the DVD. The show was okay though. It obviously didn't live up to the hype, as many of us were expecting surprise appearances from the likes of Hogan, Austin, Mick Foley, or Bret Hart. As far as the extras go? I was hoping for better. Doesn't seem worth it. I would have wanted the 5 nominees for match of the decade to be featured instead of just the winner (TLC 4), which I rank 4th among the TLC matches there have been. As far as the extra RAW moments go, I've got most of them on the Best of RAW DVD's. Now there's what you guys should buy. Don't bother with this. Get the Best of RAW Vols. 1,2, and 3. They've got better extra features, and they highlight the really great years of RAW that mattered (late '97- late 2000)."
1,Garbage!,"The Raw X show was a complete let down and nothing special. The show was supposed to be a celebration of the first 10 years from raw, however, the first 6 years are mostly ignored! Only the more recent Raw moments are featured. A complete waste of a show and further proof that the wwe ship is sinking."
1,Horrible Way To Celebrate 10 Years Of Entertainment,"Title says it all. I mean there were no surprise comebacks. The one thing people wanted to see. On the ticket it said it would feature over 50 people present AND past. No one. Not Bret Hart, not Mick Foley, almost half the nominees didn't show, and they didn't have people who did have signed contracts there like Kevin Nash, Steve Austin, and even The Rock (you can't count a pre-taped segment that they showed on the tron there). The only thing that was worth watching was the tributes to deceased legends and clips from old school WWF (I, for one, refuse to call it 'WWE'). My heart was beating right before the show, expecting old school wrestlers to show up, after the show I my heart was plain and simple dead with dissappointment. So if you want to catch a few glimpses of old school wrestling, then purchase it."
2,WWE raw 10th aniversary,"this was the worst dvd i ever bought, it is just a show that was on tv in 2003, the extras suck, and they skip alot of the early days of raw, if you just have the urge to get it then do it but i do not reccomend this!!!"
2,Disk Doesn't Work,"I've wanted this movie for a while, so I finally ordered it. The price was great considering it's old and that I really wanted it. But the disc skipped in several spots, and I can't get it to play correctly on any player that I own."
4,EXCELLENT ASIAN CRIME DVD,A TOP COP RETURNS HOME FROM TRAINING IN THE USA AND SETS HIS SIGHTS ON A LEGENDARY TRIAD LEADER NEWLY RELEASED FROM PRISON. SUPER ACTION/DRAMA
2,This book is not up to the standards of LP,"The figures and schedules are way outdated. The maps are fairly accurate. It does have some good suggestions on ""Places to Eat"", but not really on ""Places to Stay"". I've used several LP guides for many different places in the World, and this book is definitely way below the rest. Still, it offers some help for the firts time travelers."
2,Shallow,"I have liked all the Janette Oke books I have read except for this one. It was shallow and disappointing. For one thing, I thought it was unrealistic that a woman would have a freight run in the ""olden days"". Also, the ending wasn't complete enough, like the other reviewers said. It also seemed inconsistant that a supposedly Godly man like Seth would fall for a snobby city-slicker like Rebecca (before she had her change of heart). And was Sarah ever going to marry Boyde? I thought that this book was uncharacteristically shallow and had a lack of spiritual depth unlike Janette Oke's other books. I really enjoyed her Seasons of the Heart series and A Bride for Donnigan."
3,What about Sarah?,"This was I good book. However,like the other reviewer, I felt it was incomplete. The whole story revolves around the main character, Sarah.Then at the end of the book the focus changes to Sarah's daughter Rebecca.When the story is over you are left wondering ""What about Sarah?"" Is there a sequel out there that I'm not aware of? If so I would sure like to read it."
3,"ok, but I have one pet peeve","It was a good book, I thought, but I had a hard time getting past the constant stuttering in the dialogue. EG: ""I--I--wish""; or ""but it--it--may be"" and so on. It became too choppy for me and I began to subconciously focus on that in the dialogue instead of what the characters were saying."
4,Well done and dark.,"Devil May Cry level 2 is creepier and darker than the previous level. With episodes filled with swearing, blood gushing demons,and Dante near to denying his own past. I laughed,got creeped out,and loved every minute of it. My only disappointment is that the art box that came with the dvd was just a pretty box with no inserts or anything else."
2,"Just a brief review of Blinkx, with no testing","From the title, this sounds like more of a review than it really is. It's basically just a description of the Blinkx desktop search engine, with some information about its features that you could find on the Blinkx site for free. The review does put Blinkx in some context, but there's no comparison with other desktop search engines. Though the writer throws in a few statistics on search, they're long outdated. Better reviews are out there, free; don't waste your money."
5,Big Joe Turner is the MAN,"If you are a fan of true rock and roll rythym and blues then you have to get this collection by Joe Turner.The only reason he wasn't bigger than Elvis or Jerry Lee was his color at the time.Jerry Lee did recognize his songs were good and brought them over to the other side, the side the mommas and daddies listened to behind their kids backs only to learn that the kids were one step ahead.Rock Roll Rythym and Blues was the first great divide that was crossed in this country in the 20th centry that brought us together.Just remember that Big Joe had a big hand in it."
5,Joe Turner Rocks,Arrived one day early. Well packaged. Excellent condition. Songs sound crisp andclear. Big Joe's voice is easily heard and the band rocks out. Well mixed and no static. Keep your foot off the gas pedal as these songs make one want to rev up the engine as the volume knob increases.
3,two bands in one box,"This is a combination of Chicago the rock band and Chicago the pop singles band. What can ""25 or 6 to 4"" have in common with ""Another Rainy Day in NYC""? I suggest you buy this for the pop singles and also buy Chicago Transit Authority (Chicago I) for the rock."
1,Fails to perform its only function,"This product is defective. The door does not drop when triggered but simply hangs up, at an angle, in the slots. No damage was evident so it must be a design defect. Worthless! I returned it."
2,2 Stars for 2 Critters,"Chip monks & squirrels were eating my potted cherry tomato vine. I thought a $20 investment is worth the joy of your own fresh juicy tasty tomatoes. I got one guy but next a squirrel got in. This guy couldn't get out but fought the cage out of shape. By the time I dropped him off 5 miles away, the cage was no longer usable. The door didn't slide smoothly any more. They kept coming into the trap, eating my cut fruits and thanking me. I attracted more critters than before! Need sturdier stuff. Meanwhile I already paid too much for my tomatoes!"
2,havahart for chipmunks,"Havahart, like most other companies, in order to continue to be profitable, have made their traps with less metal than before. The trap is lighter, and the door, since it's no longer as heavy as it was, sometimes does not slam down quick enough to catch the prey. It works as well as it can given the quality of the materials now in the trap."
4,"Works Fine, But for Chippies Get the 1025","I have an epidemic of chipmunks in my yard, causing no end of problems. I had a ""Havahart 1025 Two-Door Cage Trap"" which works great, but wanted a couple more traps to cut down the population. I've used the two side-by-side, and can tell you, that chipmunks prefer the 1025 by at least 5-1. They like the 1025 so much, I've left it out overnight without bait, and found a chippie inside in the morning.The 0745 is nice, but if you're trapping chippies, get the 1025 instead."
2,Awkward to use,"I think the trigger mechanism could be more secure, with perhaps a small notch in the metal rod to help hold the other metal rod positioned againt it in place. I also think placing bait in it is awkward to do- i.e. you can't do it easily if the trap is on the ground as your hand/arm can't bend that way into the trap so I had to hold it up which often resulted in bait falling out as the bottom is not a solid sheet of aluminum. Returnd the trap and purchased 1 from Safeguard."
5,Works as Advertised,"After reading some of the other reviews I was a little hesitant about this product. After 2 weeks and 10 catches later I have no concerns at all. Not one false catch...This trap is simple and effective. Choose and place your bait, set the arm and add some weight (a brick) so the chipmunk does not flip the device over. Check the trap every few hours and you are good to go."
2,I DONT SUGGEST IT,THE DOOR THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DROP DOWN WHEN THE RODENT IS INSIDE DOESNT GO DOWN FAST ENOUGH AND THE RODENT GETS OUT BEFORE THE DOOR CLOSES.
2,Did not work on a small rat!!!,"After four attempts to trap a small rat failed I ordered ""Snap-E Mouse Trap by Kness"" a $2.56 trap that worked on the first attempt."
1,Waste of Money!!!,Save your money. This trap will not work. The mechanisum that sets the trap is eaisly defeated by the animals you are trying to trap. The result is that the trap is constantly sprung with no animal inside.
1,cage arrived bent,The trap does not work because the cage door arrived bent. Thus the door does not slide shut.
3,Not a bad trap but could be built a little stronger.,One trapped squirrel pushed the top up and almost got free. He was only in the trap for 15 minutes. I did a little reinforcing and now is fine.
5,caught all my attic critters in one week,"worked as I hoped, will not catch mice, as they can crawl through the cracks. Small rats might also get away, but anything larger than a small rat gets caught"
5,Works Like a Champ!,"I have trapped 37 chipmunks over the last 5 years using this trap. #1, it works! I use sunflower seeds suitable for a bird feeder. Not the kind of sunflower seeds you buy at a ballgame. #2, it lasts! It is a little beat up. Some of the bigger chippys are pssd off when they get caught and really rattle the cage, so to speak. But the trap is still working. Just caught another one today. What you do with the little buggers once they're in there is your business. I know some who then tie a rope around the trap and throw it in a lake for 5 minutes. Personally, I just take them with me when I am running an errand or taking a kid to soccer practice and release them. Whatever works for you.If you have Chipmunks in your yard you need a plan to regulate their population or they'll get out of hand and ruin your plantings, tunnel under your sidewalks and driveways, eat your air conditioning wiring, etc."
2,"Squirrels, one (Won), Homeowner, zilch","Squirrels are very clever. When the 'see' a wire mesh cage they do not go in. The cage that has two trap doors so the squirrels can see clear to the other side whould have been able to trap better than the one-door model. The squirrels around my yard constantly bumped my trap and knocked the seeds (sunflower) out of the pan and out of the trap. They had a wonderful breakfast at my expense, the little buggars!"
2,Trip-2-easy-trap,The trap trigger catch is poorly designed and manufactured. Any animal can easily trip the trap without even trying to.
2,doors too light,"Too many times the bait was missing with the door opened or closed. Trip plate not sensitive enough for chipmunks. Tried to put rocks on plate, still no luck. Even tried to put magnets on the door for extra weight still trap was empty with bait gone and the door open.Amazon was great they took back the traps for a full refund, there return policy is the best. I am going to purchase havahart 1025 and see if the do the trick."
2,Bogus Havahart Trap,"This Havahart trap is junk...supposed to be for chipmunks, but the way it's set allows them to get the bait without setting off the trap. This has happened quite a few times. I'd try another brand,"
1,Terrible design,"This thing was never designed to work in any practical manner. The trigger mechanism was almost impossible to set, and work. Better off with one of the swing down doors as my large Havaheart has. avoid the frustration."
1,Chipmunks 's trap does not work,"Chipmunks don't eat the baits (peanut butter, peanut, raisin...).Squirrels were trapped and destroyed the case plastic door holder.Save your money, try others. If you must have a life trap, try some that don't have plastic parts."
3,MADE IN CHINA and it shows,"My neighbor and I joined forces in the great ""Chipmunk Relocation Program"" of 2012. He had an old Havahart that had been with him for over 20 years and I bought mine from amazon last week. Let me tell you, they don't even look remotely the same. Mine is super cheap and flimsy. I can't imagine why, but so far he's caught 2 chipmunks in his; I've caught none. Maybe it's because his is the double-door model and the chipmunks can't see the caging at the end?Anyway, it's been a bust so far. I wish that Americans valued American manufacturing a little bit more...Why does Amazon's description still say Made in USA? Seems like an invalid statement. You know, this trap is just ok. But what are the alternatives? I think I'd check Craigslist or yard sales for the old school Havahart before buying a new, cheapy Chinese one."
3,The rat outsmarted this Havahart,"We wanted to catch a rat that had been living in our backyard for some time before he expanded his family. He figured out how to lift the door and he escaped twice. He's still on the loose. Meanwhile, we caught two skunks and a squirrel."
4,Delivered today & caught two!,This item was delivered around noon today and I've already caught two critters!!No false triggers and trap is simple to bait and set. I smeared peanut butter on the trigger and placed the trap in known travel zones. Release is also easy and fingers are safe during the process.
1,he escaped,It was dark but I thought I saw him in there after we heard the trap door shut got gloves and he was gone but door was closed and bread had been moved
5,Great Live Trap,"This is the second of these we own to trap and relocate pack rats who do untold damage to gardens, vehicle wiring and cactus deposits in the horse hay. We are near a park, so we can take them to visit the park where they will not do so much harm. Other more delightful critters have found their way into the traps, but because it is a live trap, we are easily able to release them without injury."
1,Havahart 0745 Doesn't work,"Purchased 2 of these traps. Upon receipt, I tried them out. The doors would not fully shut (hung up on the way down). I would not recommend these traps because they do not work. Have used the Havahart 2 door traps in the past and would recommend those."
5,It works,"Purchased this havahart trap weeks ago. It is very affective for catching chipmunks. Although I wasn't trying to catch squirrels, I caught a few of them as well. Within the 1st 6 hours of putting this trap out, I caught 3 chipmunks. I drove nearly 5 miles to drop chipmunks off at forest preserve. Thats the only issue, driving these animals far away. The only setback with the trap, is that if you leave out where it can get wet, it will start to rust. I placed peanut butter inside trap, however I believe the chipmunks have found a way to get peanut butter without triggering trap. The past 2 days I placed peanut butter inside trap, and when I go to check trap, peanut butter is gone. I guess after seeing how their friends were trapped, they found how to cheat cage. Good product, I would highly recommend !"
2,Think twice before you buy,"I gave this animal trap 2 stars because I caught a squirrel and expect more to be trapped. I withheld 2 stars because the door latch was broken within an half hour of the squirrel trying to escape and 1 star was withheld because of the mess that was made by the squirrel getting cut on the sharp edges.The door is easy to open and close. Well it was easier, but one of the side door supports bent. The old one I had was a lot better with the exception of ease of opening the door. I'll use this trap until my patience wears thin cleaning up each time and then look for something better."
3,It needs to be painted!,"While the 0745 trap is well-built, the manufacturer needs to look at it through a squirrel's eyes. This shiny silver trap chased my pests back up their tree.I have since spray-painted it satin green and will try it again.I note that other Havahart traps are green. We use a larger (green) Havahart trap for raccoons, and it is very successful."
2,"Havaahart 0745 16"" x 6"" x 6-3/8""","As always from Amazon the order came on time, the live trap is perfect size for small rabbits & chipmunks but the Qualityis not to Par, the whole cage is out of square & the door did not close properly I had to tape weight to the door tomake it latch properly.but after the repairs I have caught Rodents with this trap."
3,it works but . . .,"The trap worked to trap a roof rat for me but there is no easy way to empty the trap of a live animal. The release to open the trap's door is poorly placed so that the trapped animal can easily bite or claw your fingers. This is not ""the better rat trap"" design. Havahart has another design that puts your hands out of harm's way."
5,Great trap!,"Takes about 60 seconds to figure out how to set it up ... simple. Caught 3 chipmunks in the house ... a surprise!If nothing happens right away, wait a day or so. They can't resist the seed or the peanut butter."
2,Mediocre Trap,"I got this to Trap Squirrels as I have too many around, that were getting into my bird feeders. It did a mediocre job of trapping the animals. It did work in that I got rid of the ones getting into my bird feeders and the squirrels left eat the seeds off the ground and do not bother the feeders."
3,The trap will probably work if you don't mind fine tuning it,"I get frustrated when I receive a product that requires I must fix something out of the box. In this case there were 2 somethings, a ring that holds the trip mechanism had fallen off and the spring that locks the door down wasn't working properly. Neither were difficult fixes but I wouldn't suggest you buy this unless you enjoy fixing things. Another example of better living through outsourcing to China! Now that it looks like it's functioning properly, we'll see if it catches any chipmonks"
5,Awesome!!,Bought this to trap ground squirrels which were messing up my yard.. very easy to setup.. placed some sunflower seeds inside and around the trap and within two days i had caught 4 little buggers!!! released them in a park far far away..
4,A day off from the pesky critters,"The order for the chipmubk trap was placed on a Monday morning. The next day, the mailman left at my door a strange long shape box. I was not expecting anything so soon, so I wondered what could be in it. I briskly opened it to see the trap had arrived; I could not believe such a prompt delivery. Immediately I set the trap, and placed it somewhere in the yard infested with chipmunks, expecting that I would soon get rid of them even one by one, for good. As I kept waiting for the first animal to be caught, it was then that I realized they were suddenly deserting the yard. I could not understand what happened to them. Finally one came around, and got himself to become my first catch. The trap is still set and ready, but the chipmunks probably know something about trapping, so they stay away. Whether I caught them all or they no longer come in the yard, the trap has accomplished its duty."
5,Music to Get You Dancing,"I'm a big fan of merengue music, but I think that all of Oro Solido's albums are the best. This album is no exception, it also fits into one of Oro Solido's Best Catergory."
4,Excellent look at Grant and Lee,"Rhea delivers again with a taut, well-written appraisal of Grant and Lee grappling in Virginia. I found this more enjoyable than his earlier two works on the Wilderness and Spotsylvania. His examination of the resources alloted to Grant and Lee and the decisions each made made was insighful.Though Rhea sometimes appears to tilt his hat in favor of Robert E. Lee, the bias is minimal at best and never detracts from the flow of the narrative. For anyone interested in the Virginia campaign of '64, this is a must read."
1,Spoiler Alert!,"Despite the claim of 49 tracks on theis disc, there are in fact only four tracks and, though two are excellent, I would have felt better knowing that was what I was getting. If you think the listed samples are worth the asking price, power to you. Be aware, that's all you're getting for you money. Pretty much a single. Buyer beware!"
2,Not practical at all,"Every time i see a ""practical"" book that contains a dozen pages about equivalence classes I want to scream. This book is no different. Don't know what black box testing is? Well, here you find it.The authors explain how to report defects in Excel (is anybody out there still doing that?)! Nowadays one would certainly use Bugzilla, Jira or the like.Test automation is always about tools (even if it is a self created framework) but this book is general.Test scripts should follow standard programming practice (which is even explained!). Well, it is code, so that is no great surprise.The one practical thing is the statement about where to start automation: ""where it feels right"". Yeah, thanks for that tipp.Conclusion: Don't waste your time. You will probably be better of if you grab a book about JUnit testing, Fitnesse or the like."
2,a bit cheap,"got this as a replacement for a cracked tank lid. It is plastic and it's a bit bigger than a regular sized toilet, it did not fit well but I had to keep it because it was the only replacement I could find."
3,Replacement Universal Toilet Tank Cover,"As a rental property owner, I find this product to be a life saver. I must be unusual in that I have never broken the tank cover on a toilet in 50 years of home ownership. OK, that's not part of the review.Finding a tank cover to fit toilets manufactured earlier than 10 years before the date they are broken is a serious problem and costly when you find one. I find this inexpensive unit works well and provides a flat surface useful for toiletry item storage. Spacers and screws provided with the unit will permit you to adjust the unit so it fits fairly snugly on the tank.While not as attractive as a porcelain, the price is reasonable and it serves its purpose well."
2,Cheap and Ugly,This is only for those that are desparate. It is ugly. You literally could just put a plastic bag over the tank and it would look nicer.
2,Liquid didn't ship well,"Be careful buying this through the mail, it does not seem to ship as well as other items Amazon sells (solids). The top cracked on one jug I ordered and I received a *highly perfumed* cardboard box with goop inside. Perhaps they will come up with other packaging for the product, or an alternative method for packing liquids in boxes."
5,Convenient delivery,"Received this in perfect condition, packed VERY well, double boxed, sealed in plastic, surrounded by bubble wrap, and reinforced with air packages. Could not have been packed and shipped any better."
3,Interesting but not essential,"This EP is mainly worth picking up for the Stones cover. If you're new to BoS, I recommend starting with Love Agenda or the Peel Sessions."
4,"Practical, enjoyable introduction to Latin rhythms","Tons of more advanced chord voicings there so you might want to be playing the guitar for a while. No need of virtuosistic skills, though. It is about internalizing the rhythms and becoming familiar with the typical chords of latin music. After mastering this book, you will be ready to read a bossa nova song-book and play the tunes with decent strumming patterns. It might help your cha-cha jams, too. The Cd really helps, too.I am glad I purchased this book and I recommend it."
5,Easy to follow,"This study guide is easy to follow and gives you plenty of practice. All-in-all, I think it is a very good tool and would recommend it along with the ""A Basic Course in Amercan Sign Language"" book."
4,ASL text,"This was purchased as a text for an ASL class (actually 2). It was essential for preparing for class and reviewing progress. A person could use this to learn outside the formal classroom, along with online dictionaries that demonstrate the signs. Some signs are difficult to express in a simple picture or photo."
3,Study Only,"This book was not what I had in mind. I had believed that this included vocabulary. However, it is only a study book, no vocabulary at all. It will come in handy when instructing, but wasn't what I thought it was at first."
4,student study guide to a basic course in asl,I received the book in a timely manner and was quite pleased of it's condition because it is an older publication. Thank you!
4,A Great Tool,"This study guide is a great tool to use with A Basic Course in American Sign Language. It reinforces each lesson, reviews and incorporates previous lessons. I took an ASL course using these two books and have gone back to the study guide many times to review lessons."
2,Customer Service Issue,"I was having difficulties with the sizing for this shoe, so I called Amazon.com customer service. The lady was very polite, but could not locate the item. After giving her assistance, she was able to locate the shoe and told me that they were sold out and it could not be ordered.I had the item in my cart so I just clicked to buy it anyway. Either I got it or I didn't. No harm done.It was shipped that day. I will receive it in the mail today.The product itself is great. I have a pair of brown ones...had them for years and still going strong. And I am not a Dr. Marten's fan at all.But I don't think customer service means the customer provides the service to the company...and I was given incorrect information regarding these shoes being in stock."
1,uncomfortable,"this shoes are as rock, very very hard, uncomfortable.if you want rocks in yours shoes, this shoes can bring.my feet were in pain after wearing them for one day"
1,"defective shoes, have to pay the shipping to return it","The left shoe was fine. But, the right one's insole was not flat that I have to return it.The seller made me to pay $7 to sipping them back.I would say I like the shoes but the product they are selling may have a high defective percentage."
2,Not really worth the cheap price,"The buds don't fit well in my ear and the bud pads slip off easily. Sound thin and tinny. The buds are ""tall"" and stick out of my ear canal and fall out if I even move my head. My expectations weren't super high based on the price, but even those expectations weren't met."
1,Give me a break from rip off Spring Break videos,Absolutely abysmal! Has none of the finesse or production values of Girls Gone Wild nor none of the rawness of Girls Going Crazy. Even worse it has none or very little (I'm not sure as I fast forward the entire tape)girl coverage. It seems all he did was spend the entire shoot in one spot of the beach and all you have is really a lot of guys drunk. Very very little of good quality bikini girls and no nudity unless I missed a few seconds worth during fast forward. Yet another DVD where I am fortunate that the case isn't broken so I can use it to replace a broken case! Shuck this sucks! His other film Spring Break the Movie does feature some fairly decent nudity but from memory the film quality was poor. I suggest that you try that one but not this one and only if it is available for well under $10.
4,Best comp I've heard in a few months,"Being an aficanado of bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquillity, I purchased this CD on a whim. At first, I thought of this compilation as a spectrum of musical genius. At one end, I was enchanted with the beautiful ballad ""Walking in the Air."" On the other end, you have the songs ""Therein"" and ""Only for the Weak,"" which throw me into a state of euphoria. But the rest of the album had me sitting there twiddling my thumbs wandering I was to do.Well, I gave the album a few more turns in the CD player and to my surprise, I was hooked. The best songs on the album would have to be ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" ""Only for the Weak,"" Enter Vril Ye,"" ""Therein,"" ""Aoede"" and ""Walking in the Air."" All the rest of the songs are alright. The only blemish would be ""New World Order,"" which would be a killer song if it wasn't warped and left alone.So there you have it, not an instant classic, but a decent compilation that will either keep your head banging or your mind wondering."
4,POETRY IN MOTION...THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROPE,"Lyrically written, the author, Gaston Rebuffat, one of the world's climbing greats, expresses such joy for mountaineering that it is infectious. No climbing enthusiast's library should be without this book. The photograph of Rebuffat which graces the cover of this book is alone worth the price of the book.Rebuffat is positively poetic in his description of various climbs. The reader almost feels as if one were as one with the mountain. A purist, the author climbed not for the glory of it, but for the sheer joy of the brotherhood of the rope. In these days, where climbing is often just a reason for a media event, the author's approach is refreshing, indeed."
5,Outstanding Book from Outstanding Climber!,"""Starlight and Storm"" is one of these rare examples of an outstanding climber who can also write engagingly and with poetic verve!Rebuffat is unquestionably one of the outstanding climbers of the early post WW II mountaineering in Europe and perhaps the most outstanding French climber of the period. His achievements (first French climb of the Walker Spur of the Grand Jorasses; first French Climb of the north face of Eiger, member of the Anapurna expedition) speak for themselves.What also sets apart Rebuffat from many others (many climbers write books to underwrite financially their future expeditions or to underscore their achievements) is his joyful, honest and inspired writing. Rebuffat has a real talent to convey beautifully his emotions and leads us masterfully along his fascinating climbs.This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in mountaineering, and I commend John Krakauer for including it in the new ""Exploration"" series!"
3,For Alps and Mountaineering Lovers,"I really liked this book, but I believe one has to be enraptured of the Alps, or the history of mountain climbing, to share my enthusiasm for it. After living in Europe, and continuing to travel there frequently, I find that I am fascinated by the Alps and their history. This book is a pleasant excursion into the Alps for those interested in mountain climbing, but not a travel book, or even much of a story book, although the story is interesting. I find myself comparing old maps to new ones, and relating them to the places I have been. A bit more of a research project than light reading. This book is like watching a documentary, one that airs on public TV for specific audiences, not one on the networks for general consumption. If you are interested in the Alps, or personal stories of mountain climbing you will enjoy this book."
5,Why are there only 3 Borrible books?,"These three books are fantastic, why can't there be more of them? Where is the author? What other books has author written? I want the Borrible story to continue!"
2,Boring... just kids jumping around,"Too much talking in between the music sections. Not enough muppet action. Too much footage of kids jumping around (""dancing"").This could have been so much better if they had simply pieced together upbeat musical muppet segments from everyday episodes. We are much more entertained by the wit and energy of the daily musical segments on any given Sesame Street episode. We want to see singing pigs, dancing monsters, horn-playing muppets, guest singers... you know what I mean if you watch the show.Skip this video. It's lame."
1,boring; too little action and interaction; no age likes it,"We usually love Sesame Street and the title and description of this video made it impossible to pass up. We do not own or watch many videos, but this looked so good! It was such a disappointment. Our toddler daughter lost interest immediately. The only song that was fun (and now the only one we play) is the ""Birthday"" one; the animal noises in this one are fun for a younger toddler age group. The video is condusive to nearly NO interaction with the live audience (the dances and songs are boring), and it is too chatty (and the conversation is boring). Sad. It had such potential!"
1,Irritating,"There are so many things that I do not like about this video, BUT, I have a child with Autism and this helped her put multiple steps together and increased her vocabulary.I put it in and go to the other room."
3,Disappointing,"This was tape most disappointing. It's defintely not what I was looking for. As one previous viewer stated, the beginning of the tape is long winded and the dance instructor is much too aware of the camera instead of acting natural. However as you got more in the middle it became a little more bearable.The quality of this tape cannot be compared to other Sesame Street productions."
2,very out of date,"Quite disappointed in how old this video is. The songs, style and everything are nothing that grabs the attention of my child."
4,This DVD made my son forget about Baby Einstein,"My 22 month old son LOVES this DVD, which is a blessing & a curse. He wants it on all the time and will not watch any other video. He used to love Baby Einstein videos but not anymore. He likes to watch the other kids dance and he dances with them. I think it's really helped him to watch, listen & follow instructions. It is so cute when he does the Grouch dance. At first I was uncomfortable with the Grouch dance b/c it seemed too negative but then I realized that it's good & important for kids to be able to express all kinds of emotions, good & bad."
2,Cute but not worth the money,My 19 month old son loves Barney and sits through full hours of Barney. I don't think I got more than 5 minutes from this tape. I wasn't even entertained. I lost interest myself and I'm an adult. It was cute and had it's moments but I wouldn't say it was worth the full price.
1,Mostly dull and annoying,"My son owns quite a few Sesame St DVDs but this is by far the worst one. The dance teacher is dreadful - she has a terrible singing voice, and her speaking voice is pretty annoying too. The plot is very dull and most of the action takes place in a dance studio/classroom. Mostly it shows children, not much of the muppets. The dances themselves don't have interesting moves, and the songs are not at all memorable for their tune or their words."
5,not impressed,"My daughter doesn't really enjoy these much, while other videos capture and keep her attention, this sesame street video does not. It seems super dated and low quality. would not recommend."
4,grandson loves this video,"My grandson is 19 monthes and just loves this video. Especially likes the airplane portion - walks around singing ""now now now"". He also enjoys the song where you pretend you are a dog. Also seems fascinated by the new way to walk portion. He still can't do all the moves but still loves doing what he can. A good purchase!"
5,Daughter's Favorite Video,"My 18 month old daughter is obsessed with this movie. It is great because it holds her attention the entire time. She loves watching the other kids dance and dances right along with them. As soon as she gets up in the morning she starts saying ""sess"", its the first thing she thinks about doing every day! I highly recommend this video!"
5,AN ENERGY RELEASER!,"This video is great- my 3 yr old wanted to watch it and dance with it over and over again! It is not the best video for right before bed time, but great when your child has a lot of energy (which seems to be always!) and it is very cute and entertaining for parents too. My son watches this video more than the others we have at home!"
2,Not as good as other sesame street videos,"The fun of watching Sesame Street videos is that they are often as entertaining for the adults as for the children. This video got old on the first viewing. The reason? Celina. She was chewing the scenery and her loud screechy voice and off key signing made me run for the remote. Unlike other Sesame Street live actors who let the muppets do their thing, Celina seems intent on taking center stage and manages to overwhelm both the muppets and the room full of kids. My mom, who was in the other room, remarked ""her voice gets on my nerves"". My son wanted to me to stop the video and put in another Sesame Street video. Gladly. The good things? There were a few muppet songs that appear on other tapes and Sesame street always has a multicultural cast. Parents, you don't want to watch this one over and over."
5,quite perfect!,The book arrived before the term (I live in Italy) and the service was amazing! Just pay attention on the delivery charges because they are quite expensive!! :)
2,Watching the English,Very long-winded. Written by a scientist who won't let go of certain words. Could have been a much more enjoyable read if it were half the size. But still -- the information which was tucked into it was helpful.
2,Amazon Verified Purchase,"Watching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behaviour""Sorry,"" but I found the book somewhat redundant. Perhaps hiring a good editor would help to reduce the book to half the size. A good editor may also catch the grammatical errors of which I found four (fewer/lesser; lay/lie, etc.)."
2,Bed-time reading?,"Not exactly a rivetting read, this is a rather repetitive of account of one social anthropologist's attempt to characterize the quirks of the 'English' character. While claimig to cover all bases, the emphasis is on 'suburbia' and, despite a struggle to avoid this, the tone is irredeemably middle-class.The popularity of this book is difficult to understand, but this reviewer suspects that the appeal derives from a readership that is itself both anglophile and 'middle-class' in outlook. The expression 'ango-saxon attitudes' springs to mind!"
2,Silly and stupid,"Both my wife and I are into gaming, but not this type of dress-up/act out gaming.Unlike some other reviewers here, I didn't think the ""players"" gave it their all. They were ignoring ""game decorum"" every 10 seconds or so, so it really made everyone look half-hearted and silly. There were a few comedic moments here and there which were ok, but the drama was totally uninteresting. Maybe there is a good story here somewhere, but neither my wife nor I could get into this film.A big thumbs down for us!"
5,Great Item,"This roll up Tonneau is great. It fits my toyota pick up perfectly. The installation was so easy once you got started. The price was so reasonable. The local truck accessory shops wanted almost three times the cost I paid to Amazon. My friend has the exact same bed cover, but what he paid for his is insane...."
3,Basic,It's a good book in the most basic sense. I personally feel it lacks information. The list of canary clubs in the book is also very outdated with web links that are no longer in service. Check out Barrons Canary Handbook for a better intro to canaries. It's more comprehensive than this book.
1,low quality,"The content and format of this Bible is wonderful. I bought this particular style because I liked the two toned design. As it turns out, the brown dye has bled into the green and looks terrible. It has never gotten wet...just bled on its own."
2,Faulty formatter board,"After two years, my 2015d stopped printing. The paper jam light stayed on. There was no paper jam. HP was not helpful. I was ready to buy a new printer, because repair cost more, when I discovered via online forums other customers with the same printer had experienced the same problem.The solution is to remove the formatter board, bake it at 350, propped up on a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil; then cool for 30 minutes before reinstalling. When I first saw this solution, I was doubtful. But it works!According to the forum contributors, HP tried a new cold solder method on the formatter board that doesn't hold. All it needs is heating up. HP should let customers know about this. It would save landfills from 1000s of perfectly repairable printers! Shame on you HP, for not letting your customers know. Otherwise, it's a good printer. They just need to tell their customers how to keep it working."
1,Formatter board yet no recall?,"Same problem as has been reported here by others. Worked perfectly for about a year and then the indicator lights started to report 'toner low' 'paper jam' although these were not in fact accurate indications. The printer began only printing one job and then had to be 'reset' to print ONE more job and now it doesn't print anything. This has been diagnosed as a 'formatter board' problem and is very costly to repair. Again, warranty no longer in place. Having spent $500.00 for the printer and relying on HP's positive reputation I'm surprised and disappointed that there has not been a 'recall' for this equipment?!"
5,Awesome Printer,This is one of the best laser printers HP has made in a long time.Very fast.Duplex is awesome.One printer is attached to an Airport Extreme. Computers are running Mac OS X 10.5.The other 2015 (without a duplexer) is running attached to a PC running XP Pro.Excellent printers.
2,caution,"For a printer of this cost, one expects it would not be so difficult. Basically, this printer works only when it wants to. It does not matter if it is networked or using USB-the consistency is poor. The ""printer offline"" message comes up more often than not, even when everything is fine! According to various help sites I have looked at, this is a common problem with the 2015 models. I beg you to use caution in considering this printer!"
2,worked well...for 18 months,"This printer has only served to convince me that HP products have really been going downhill. Six months out of warranty & it is non-functional, requiring $100+ of repairs."
1,2nd failure,"I bought this printer in September 2009 and was initially very happy with it. The quality wasn't as nice as some laser printers, but it was fast and a great bargain. After a year of use, however, it just stopped working. I spent time with the service center and was eventually told that it had a bad formatter board and I could replace it for $100. Since that was cheaper than buying a new one, I decided to give it one more shot. It's been 4 months and it just went out on me again (one month past the warranty). I was printing for my class tomorrow and it just stopped. Now I'm getting the amber light error message that it's out of paper and ink, neither of which is true. I'm totally soured on HP."
1,only had this printer for less than 8 months,"After 8 months, the printer failed. So far, this apparently happens to most people, and some people have found success with getting a new DIMM with new firmware. To me, this is absolutely ridiculous. For how much I paid for this thing, it shouldn't just stop printing. There is a problem with the power save where you have to manually power cycle the printer to get it to print. And sometimes that doesn't even work. Very frustrating. I am going to have to buy a new printer now. What a waste of money."
2,Printer Not Vista Compatible,"The printer works great with my computer running XP SP1, but is not compatable with a newer computer running XP or any of my laptops that are running Vista. The fact that this printer is NOT Vista compatible should be highlighted."
1,Incompatible with Vista,"Just purchased this printer based on good reviews. Needed a solid, duplex capable printer, nothing fancy, for medium volume printing. The CD immediately indicated that i was lacking a dll file. I am running Vista 64 bit currently. Tried windows update and the HP website with no success, as their 'updates' either don't run on my machine or keep referring me to the other (windows and HP) in a circular fashion. Have run into a few other reviewers (including one on this website i wish i'd read before buying) indicating that it's a Vista incompatibility problem. Further research shows that very few printers are Vista compatible, much less one that duplexes. Very painful experience, going to return printer tomorrow as don't feel like dealing with 4 hours of third-world 'support'."
2,Works good when it's working.,"I bought 3 of these for my office. One stopped working within a month and had to be returned. All of them have run into situations where they have stopped printing and required powering them and off and on. We have no other printer that have ever had such problems, in recent memory. We have them on the internet, so that may the cause of these problems, but am not sure. These new printers obviously have not been fully debugged."
2,Automatic duplex function won't work with Vista OS,"I purchased the 2015d directly from HP. The automatic (vs. manual) duplex function was my main purchase criteria, thus the choice of the 2015d rather than the 2015. Specs at the HP site stated that the 2015d is ""certified for Windows Vista"" and is ""Windows Vista ready"". These statements are misleading: Vista does not support the automatic duplex function of this printer. After many hours of effort, I called HP tech support and they confirmed/shared this info post-purchase."
4,Vista Compatible,"I could not resist the price of the 2015d despite the negative reviews considering the Vista compatibility. I received the printer from Amazon yesterday and 30 minutes after calling HP support, it was working great. The CD does not work on Vista, so if you have that don't even try to use it. Two drivers have to be downloaded from the HP site. The HP tech was very easy to understand and very helpful. In order to use the duplex feature, 2 sided printing must be set in printer preferences. It would be nice if that were automatic but for a final cost of $198, I can live with that. The manual also needs to be downloaded from the HP site. I replaced my HP 1200 with the printer and appreciate the added features. I would highly recommend ordering the additional paper tray as the one that comes with the computer only holds 50 sheets."
1,terribly unreliable with formatter issue - replacement unit also broke down,"I have exactly the same problem after use of less than 3 months. HP sent me a replacement unit which also broke down after a month. It was same formatter issue both times. I'm terribly disappointed with this product. Not something that I expect with HP's reputation. It was a charm while it worked but terribly unreliable. Phone support while helpful was a nightmare to navigate through. I had to repeat my problems to 4 different people and stay on the line for over an hour. I'm demanding a refund.After checking the online forums, this formatter problem seem to be very common among the P2015. HP shouldn't have sold the printers knowing that.I would have put zero star if I could."
1,Do not buy this printer,"I bought this printer for work in November 2007. In about December 2008, it stopped printing. I found out later that this is a known issue. The printer goes to sleep in power save mode, and doesn't ""wake up."" You have to turn the printer off and then back on to get it to print. This gets quite annoying when you have to do this 20+ times a day.Of course, the printer is out of warranty. HP sent me a new part, which didn't fix the problem. I can now either spend $250 to have the printer repaired or buy a new printer."
4,"useful, a bit 'light' on the content","Data Strategy doesn't really deliver what it promises. The book starts out hopeful, but then you keep wondering when the 'data-strategy part' is going to materialze. It doesn't.What DOES the book offer? In various disciplines surrounding database management, data warehousing, data quality, etc. the authors have loads of experience and truly valuable advice. The book comes packed with all sorts of checklists which some may find useful (I didn't care for them so much). These people have clearly been around, and share quite some of their experience with the reader."
1,An introductory book only,"If you are data management professional, you will find that this book is only surface deep. For example, there is a chapter on Data Quality. If you want to learn more about data quality, you should read Larry English's book Improving Data Warehouse and Business Information Quality. There is a chapter on metadata. Again, if you want to know more about metadata, get a book or a few books on metadata. Use the reference after each chapter to find out the books on the chapter topic.If you find this book helpful, this indicates you are new to data management.A good introductory data management book."
3,"A disappointment, but still an authority","My mother has a copy of the original edition, so I grew up treating Vanderbilt's work as a constant reference for social graces. Naturally, I was overjoyed to learn that a new edition had made an appearance. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.With no disrespect intended to Tuckerman et al for their fine work, this once-great guide is a shadow of its former self. It is no less accurate than it once was, but is unfortunately much more base. Do people really need to be told not to leave dirty dishes lying about, for example?As a guide to minimal civilized behaviour--how not to behave like a spoiled child--it carries the tradition of excellence. However, for the finer points of etiquette, I strongly recommend tracking down a copy of the 1978 (Baldrige ed.) edition of this great reference."
3,Going down compared to first two,"Truly I wish I could like this series more than I do. ""Kristin Lavransdatter"" is one of my all time favorite books and like I said in my previous two reviews of this saga, it just is not up to par of Undset's previous work. As I said, my expectations were too high going into the Master of Hestviken. And with book three, Undset's plot was just not going anywhere. There really was nothing going on until the end of it, when the battle scene ensued, it was just Olav constantly bickering with his son. Still don't feel anything for the characters witherI've gotten this far, might as well finish the last book, however, it will be like a child swallowing some bad cough medicine. If there is anything hidden up Undset's sleeve to finish this series, I just pray it is good and I may be able to change my mind and recommend this to friends and family."
3,"Nice Harry Potter set, NOT a Lewis Isle reproduction","This is a nice novelty chess set. It came carefully packed in foam that isolated each piece.That said, I suggest you spend some time with one of the recent museum books that show what the real Lewis Isle chess men look like.This set has none of the individual charm or detail that makes the real thing such a marvel. If I may use an automotive comparison, this set issort of like a Ford Mustang compared to a Porsche. It may be good, but not in the same class."
4,A Lifetime Ode To Mother Love And Sacrifice: No Daughter Left Behind,"From 2006, ""Augusta, Gone"" has an edginess in style that you might not be used to from other endeavors on the Lifetime network. Capturing the wildness of the feature film ""Thirteen"" (among dozens of others), the story is about a young girl who is descending into a life of drugs and debauchery. Mika Boorem does a good job channeling the severe angst in Augusta as she perpetually seems determined to derail her life. But the movie, as you might expect from Lifetime, is about unconditional love and redemption as well. A terrific Sharon Lawrence plays a mother who will do anything to bring her daughter to safety. ""Augusta, Gone"" may be intended as a fact based cautionary tale but I'll remember it for the distinctive lead performances. Strong and emotional stuff. KGHarris, 7/12."
2,Not Reliable,"I bought this model right after it was available in Dec last year. Initially it worded great. But after only two months, all the audio inputs do not work. I have to pay for the shipping for the exchange under the warranty. One more thing I like to point out. AM/FM radio receiption wasn't that great -- due to the relative low sensitivity. Wouldn't recommand it."
1,"Unreliable, Quit After 2 Months","I like the receiver but it died after only two months. It randomly shuts down. The kicker is there aren't any service centers in the San Francisco Bay Area (2nd or 3rd largest metropolitan area in the country) and I have to ship this heavy paperweight on my own dime. Also, Harman Kardon has some of the rudest service center/tech support reps I've spoken with. Thought I was buying the best..."
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY THIS ONE !",ALL SONGS TAKEN FROM PAST YEARS TELEVISION SERIES. SOUNDS LIKE A ONE PIECE BAND. SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE THE TOM JONES I SAW IN LAS VEGAS.
4,Good for tinned foie gras.,"This is a great quick foie gras if you can't source your own goose liver and need a long-storing quick pate. The funny thing is, I can find this locally for three times the price, so this is a bargain. Highly recommended."
1,Nonexistent plot,"Clan Novel: Tremere had no plot; it was simply a collection of scenes from previous stories as observed from the Tremere perspective, with several vignettes of Tremere chantry life added for flavor. At the end, the author contrives to explain the murky plot in a dialogue between the main characters, but the proffered explanation is weak.After losing interest in the book, I only continued to see if any new elements would be added to the story, having read the previous 11 novels. I finished the book with the feeling that my time had been completely wasted."
1,The worst book I've ever read!,"I wish you could enter 0 stars! This book was terrible! It has nothing to do with vampires, blood drinking, intrigue...! The best chapter in the book you already got to read in a previous book. The vampires in this book acted nothing like vampires (they cried like babies because they hated all the deceit surrounding them?). If it were not for the cover I would't even believe it was the same series. I spent my time reading the ten previous books and am terribly disappointed. ""Malkavian"" was bad, but compared to this book it should be an american classic! I have not yet read the last book, I hope Fleming doesn't let me down. I hope this helps someone. Don't even read this one, you don't have to."
3,Not as impressive.,"Honestly, I would equivilance this book to the Clan Novel Toreodor. The bad side of it includes that the story is too vague to be truly enjoyed. Everything is in a dream state description. And most of all, I did not find any section of it pulling me to read it like some of the other Clan Novels. An example I would give is the beginning of it where Sturbridge is involved in a big ritual. How she got up there, the powers she used, the little component details were all lacking. The whole thing had little background and a lot of dream description. On the good side of the story, it did explain the Giovanni death. The author was really good about showing damn disciplined is the Tremere clan.Not the best of the clan novels, that's for sure."
5,Every Shiatsu Practitioner should have one,"Everyone who studied Namikoshi Shiatsu must have this book. Namikoshi Shiatsu is based on Western Anatomy and Physiology, and is not based on TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) as Zen Shiatsu or Masunaga Shiatsu. This book clearly outlines a full body treatment (reclined and seated) with clear photos and graphics. There is also a chapter for Do-in (self administered treatment).I suggest that you only buy the book if you have been trained as a Shiatsu practitioner or if you have received training in other similar modalities, such as Thai Massage. It is important to have that hands on experience, because the book will not teach you how to feel."
5,get this 1,"this is real shiatsu as known in japan.most books are zen shiatsu which has a different set of points.the points in this book are very powerfull. i only wish they were covered in more detail on how to find all the points. i recieved shiatsu at a place with japanese peoplo from japan then bought this book.. so i learned from the book and my shiatsu sessions... i dont think i would understand the way i do without the shiatsu sessions. but many points listed on the chart i have found nowhere else so far. this book is extremely practical and i am still learning from it. so far this book and trigger points have been my most powerfull tools for pressure point thrapy so far. my method of pressing the points my differ from those shown in the book, but the points covered make this book an invaluable resource.as my education continues i will be able to get more and more out of this book."
2,Different picture from actual product,"When this book arrived, I almost thought it was not a book I ordered! The one I got is a very old copy, printed in 1984... I would have bought a new copy if I had known. It would have been a small price difference. Better go to a bookseller to see the actual book before buying it."
5,My 8th graders Loved This!!!,"Right now, we are studying the Revolution in my eighth grade Humanities class and I decided to have the class play this as a group, and they LOVED IT!!!! I had actually checked it out from the library, but now I'm planning on buying it because I plan on using it again and again in the future!!!"
5,Edu-tainment at it's best,"This is a great program that challenges kids on a number of levels, in a genuinely entertaining way. I love that they are encouraged to get both sides of the story, and to interview both leaders and ordinary people. Choosing the quotes to use is great for sparking conversation- whose point of view to use, which details are the most interesting / relevant. Being asked to go get things for different characters in order to get them to talk is an amusing sidelight, but the laying out of the paper- and seeing how many papers they have sold really gets them excited. And they even pick up some history from it! ;-) My 9 year old tore through it, and is now helping her 7 year old sister through it, both of them enjoying it hugely. Time for the Oregon Trail after this..."
4,Good Educational Software!!,"This is fun. It's great educational software. The only problem is that once you've played everything about 4 times, it gets boring."
5,"Great Program, Fun way to learn early American history","My kids love this game. It's like a cross between Carmen Sandiego and Freddi Fish. You ask the characters questions for information, but you have to search for objects to give the them before they'll give you the answers. What a great way to learn about early American history."
2,Tedious,"I found this book a great disappointment. The previous book by the same author was good, but this one is best described as a book you can't wait to put down. If it were not about the Puzo characters, this book would never have been be published. Save your time and money. Forget about it! The only thing you'll get out of this is that Tom Hagen was killed by Nick Geraci by way of drowning in a car. That's it. I read reviews just like this one, but am a great Godfather fan, so went ahead and bought it. Big mistake."
3,you can get too much of a good thing,Little in the way of major insights into character motivations or plot development is provided in story. The planning of a twisting approach provided by the final actions are too transparent to hold the reader's interest.
4,A Stand-Alone Classic,"Don't let the cheesy title throw you, this is a powerful book, one that stands on its own merits in the Corleone Family saga. Author Mark Weingardner does a great job putting his personal stamp on the story while staying true to Mario Puzo's basic framework. Significantly better than Weingardner's first go around with the Corleone clan in The Godfather Returns, which, while entertaining, lacked the true punch-in-the-face that this one delivers. This one will stay with you for awhile."
1,"Please ,no more.","Please, Mark Winegardner stop trying to write Puzo. You don't have the knack. Go back to writing Winegardner material. Crooked River Burning was a good book. I can't say that for these two ""Godfather"" attempts."
3,Slightly Disappointing,THE GODFATHER'S REVENGE is Winegardner's second sequel to Mario Puzo's GODFATHER. Most of the original Corleone characters are present in this book but relatively little emphasis is placed on Michael Corleone. The plot seems tired and the author's insistence on using famous events from the past seems too contrived. It's hard to get excited about this particular effort by Winegardner. His previous entry in the series was more entertaining.
2,"Seinfeld Meets the Godfather, without the humor.","I enjoyed Mr. Winegardner's first sequal very much. Enough to look forward to this installment with anticipation. I am nearly 400 pages in this nearly 500 page tome...and I still have only a vague idea why it was written.The title of this review reflects my opinion that, like the Seinfeld show, this is a ""book about nothing"". It is not funny, it is not suspenseful, it is not gory or violent, it is not interesting. Yet I will finish it, just to say I did."
2,Read this review before you try the book,There are too many books to read to make this one of them. I stuck it out through the entire tape as I was walking while reading. I now wonder why. A very disappointing attempt. Move on up the food chain of books.
4,Good for local area,This antenna seems well constructed and easy to assemble. It's very compact and will easily fit in an attic and works well this way if the stations are in the same direction and not too distant. I'm having no problem receiving my local stations which are about 12 miles away.
2,"You get what you pay for, but not this time","This antenna is a low quality item made in China. The material is super flimsy, disposable metal. It requires to be assembled with 2 bolts through 4 holes...sounds easy enough, except for the fact the holes don't line up correctly. When I finally got the bolts in after 30 minutes of swearing and finagling, one bolt was not perpendicular to the piece. It comes with an extremely poor photo copy of the assembly instructions. The quality is so poor, it is illegible.This is a cheap antenna at $24, but it is still priced too high for what it really is."
5,"great seller, great product","Love this antenna, just like a lot of the reviews say it picks up a lot of channels. It help the vhf as well as the uhf. I spent my money well.My husband bolted on top of the house and hooked it up to the cables from our satalite we used to have. So all we had to do was hook up the cables to our tv and here came the channels nice and clear. BYE, BYE static."
5,good buy,Great item for the price. I also bought the db4 as the 4 of these tied together I thought would get far better reception.One of these is great but probably not quite as good as the db4 on picking up some of the lower 2- 11 channel frequencies. Two are probably better than the db4 if you add a circular metal piece if you need lower channel numbers.
2,worse than $10 basic antenna,"I'm from Orange county, California. I bought 2 of these based on excllent reviews, one antenna for used in Irvine, one for used in Garden Grove area. I used them indoor. They performed worse than the basis RCA antenna (the one you can get at Walmart for $10). I tried quite a few kind with modern designer shapes offered by all manufacturers costing up to $100 but in my experience the basis 2 rabid ear and a metal loop work the best indoor."
4,Eagle Aspen,"I started out with an antenna made by GE bought from one of the big box home improvement stores. It was double the price and the reception was fair at best. I purchased the Eagle Aspen a fewdays ago. Out of the box, I was concerned by the flimsy construction and worried that I would bend it while putting it together.Despite that, this thing works great. I'm able to pick up 40+ stations all in HD. Installation was easy and took less than fifteen minutes. All in all it's well worth the price, just wish it was made of heavier gauge metal."
5,The Best,"This is the best outdoor antenna I have ever had! It picks up a total of 30 stations, which is 14 more than the last antenna. You have to get the angle of the antenna just right for more stations. We originally had it facing North East and got 18 channels with some of them weak. When we adjusted it to South East, the strength was excellent, and we picked up a total of 30 channels including 7 from Detroit Michigan, and I'm all the way in Cleveland Ohio."
2,If only...,"If only the holes on the two pieces that need to be assembled aligned properly, I'd have been quite happy. Unfortunately the spacing on one piece was roughly 3/4"" off from the spacing on the other piece. A couple of clamps, an electric drill and a 1/4"" bit made it all work out for less aggro than returning the thing. But didn't leave me particularly well inclined toward this particular antenna.The antenna also has an all-weather rubber cover to protect the coax connection to the balun. Ours isn't installed outdoors, but if it had been I would have complained that the cover doesn't appear flexible enough to slip over the coax connector. So you would need to slip the cover over an unterminated coax cable and then install the coax connector before connecting the coax to the balun.Other than that, the antenna seems to be quite sturdy and works well enough."
2,disappointed,"I bought this to replace my old outdoor beam antenna. First I tried this new antenna. The signal strenght was half what it used to be with 4 fewer channels, even after rotation it 360 degrees. This is definitely NOT omnidirectional. Second, I tried both antennas together. It was slightly better, but signal strength was still lower than usual. Finally I connected my old antenna back again and got 4 more channels back again with the most signal strength and best reception. I'm going to try this antenna inside on my TV in the guest bedroom. Surely it will be better than 'rabbit ears' and hopefully I didn't waste my money. If you have alot of trouble getting reception, get the old style beam antenna. You won't do any better."
5,Does What It Is Supposed To,"PROS: Assembled the product in under 10 minutes. The antenna allows me to receive many more DTV channels than expected. For the price, a great value. I tested it from inside my home and it worked great. Can't wait to see its performance outside and mounted at the roof line!CONS: There is a minor design flaw in the device; the bolt that attaches to X array to the screen is blocked by the coaxial connector. This is not hard to fix, but it is a design flaw that should have been easily corrected in the prototype stage of development."
2,Not noticably better then rabbit ears indoors,"Bought as an experiment, to see if any improvement in DTV reception indoors in multi-unit building, compared to $10 ""rabbit ears""; urban area, TV towers about 10-15 mi. away.Result: no noticable improvement over rabbit ears. Can comfirm reception is directional - will NOT receive more distant, off-center stations that rabbit ears CAN receive (on good days).My experience: worth trying out, not expensive, easy to assemble; but, for indoor urban <15mi. DTV reception, don't expect much improvement over plain ""rabbit ears""."
1,Poor quality,There were missing pieces and the reception was very poor. rabbit ears ended up having a much better reception than this antenna.
5,Does what it says,"Ended up putting it indoors... because I'm lazy, and I still get all the over the air channels I need. Reasonably priced and gives me infinitely better reception."
3,Didn't get the advertised range,"Since I have the antenna mounted in the attic, it's possible you could get the range as advertised if you mounted it on a pole outside."
5,Great antenna.,"I was not expecting much as I have tried 3 other antennas on my kitchen tv to get local channels 45 miles away. Well, this thing pulls them in and there were 2 channels I could never get that it pulls in too. Another amazing thing, my other antennas were rabbit ears and one was a flat type. They all had to have to ears moved to get various channels and this one is placed on the wall of my pantry and it gets all 12 channels without any adjustments or moving etc. I am very happy with this."
1,crap,"So, I got mine and assembled it, tried it indoors and it was pretty much the same as when I was using some rabbit ears.The coax plug in part isn't very accessible. I moved to using it outside on my roof and one of the wires broke.After reconnecting and trying again, reception was okay but not that great.I ended up buying a powered indoor/outdoor from Phillips and now I get even more channels.I get to watch Alghizeera(sp) news on KBCT now. Totally diffferent from local and other cable news."
1,Just replaced after 3 years with a flat one,UPDATE: I replaced this one after 3 years of use with a multi-directional digital flat antenna from RCA. I was skeptical of the flat one but for $12 (refurbished) it was worth the risk. I replaced the Eagle Aspen because it was big and clumsy and one of the connections came loose requiring me to reconnect by crimping it back on. I had the Eagle Aspen hanging on the wall above the tv. It was ugly and scratched up the paint over time.
1,Review,"I am confuse i bought this stuff to catch channel but it didn't work. Are you supose to use it with hdtv television. Does it work after the switch to digital singal. I need to know because there alot off good review i was wondering if they made it before the switch to the digital singal, Also are you supose to use it with converter box. Over all it didn't work i only go one channel in a bad condition and it doesn't come with the cable to pluck in the tv you have to buy it seprate. 1 out of 5"
4,Works fine but missing one screw.,"Like most other reviewers said, this antenna works better than I expected. I can pick up one VHF channel (4/6 bars) and all local UHF channels (6/6 bars for most channels). My house is about 20 miles from the main TV tower farm in central Iowa and there is another house totally blocking my direct line of sight to these towers, but this antenna works like there is nothing in-between my house and the towers. I even picked up a remote station in a different direction about 35 miles away from my house. Over in all, this thing should have received five stars from me if not that it came missing one screw for mast installation! I ended up just removing the whole back rack and screwing this antenna directly onto my outdoor sidings using two wood screws. Make sure you find your studs with a stud sensor before you screw them in. I found this installation more stable and less noticeable than putting a mast on my roof."
5,Excellent Antenna,"I purchased this antenna to replace my Tivax DT-01 antenna. I was getting about 8 stations with the Tivax antenna and as soon as I hooked up the Eagle Aspen antenna, I was getting 15 stations. The new antenna is mounted indoors in the middle of my apartment and the reception is excellent. It is ugly, I can't deny that, but based solely on the performance, I highly recommend this antenna over the traditional loop and rabbit ears type."
5,Great buy on a UHF antenna,"For under $15, you just can't beat this antenna. I bought it as a backup since I didn't have much room to mount it. I decided to install it as the main hadn't arrived yet. Didn't expect much but, was I surprised! This antenna is pulling in a low power TV station over 60 miles away with no problem. The antenna is mounted on a mast just 11 feet above ground!BUY ONE!!!"
2,2-bay Uhf Antenna,"I purchased this antenna after reading numerous reviews comparing it's capabilities with other HD/digital type antennas that are available. I was planning on using it for my multimedia PC to watch and record network TV. I built a stand from PVC so I could mount it high in the house and on the attic floor if necessary. I set the antenna up [...] and proceeded to program received channels. Once I was finished, I ended up with 2 less channels than I got with my $10 RCA rabbit ears! I tried it again after moving the antenna to different positions. The picture wasn't any better. I live in a metro area with most stations within 30-40 miles. I felt it should have gotten better reception than the rabbit ears! For the money, I'd say stick with the RCA rabbit ears."
4,Good Product,I was going to make a home make antenna but for the price and better looking than what I would have made.Customer service was great. Items came with missing hardware and I had no issue when I called to get the hardware replaced.
4,Much better HDTV picture,I had an old vhf antenna and my HDTV signal was weak .Only showed 68 on meter.Now meter reads 92 andI have no fad outs.
3,Decent product for the price,"I don't use cable TV. I use rooftop antennas to get my OTA TV signals which I think is a better uncompressed HD source than the regular cable TV...besides, it is free!I already have antennas that I can get very good VHF HD signals, but my UHF HD signals are still weak during bad weather conditions. So, I bought this antenna hoping to improve my UHF TV signals in addition to my existing antennas. It turns out about the same....not much significent improvements on my UHF signals that I can tell.Actually, this antenna does about the same just by itself (without my other existing ones)...it will pick up all the channels in my areas (by itself) just about the same (both UHF & VHF) as my other antennas do.***Conclusion: It is a decent antenna by itself for the price, but it does not improve my UHF as I was hoping for."
5,Fantastic!,"This is a great antenna. I went from 8 channels using amplified rabbit ears to 20 channels with this antenna. It's small enough to put inside or out. I mounted mine on a 6 foot pole and put it on my second floor porch. Now I have great UHF/VHF reception! I'm not sure why it's sold as just a Uhf antenna because I get Vhf as well...2, 4, 5, 7, 7-1, 10, 10-1, 12, 27, 28, 36-1, 36-2, 38, 44-1, 44-2, 44-3, 44-4, 49, 56 and 64. This includes eight different PBS channels! I am very happy with this antenna."
4,Good Antenna for good price,"First, the shipping was very fast. The product itself does not look all that beautiful but small enough to be in the room. It really picks up a lot of channels even though I do not have direct view of the signal. I live in an apartment not facing the signal. I do have to turn the antenna around to get most of the channels. I use for only HDTV signals. Analog signals do not get picked up all that well at all. I live about 8 to 15 miles from the source. The only real problem was that this plastic thing that holds the coaxial cable broke right away. No big deal, but still I don't like things breaking the moment I get the product. Not returning it because it does not interfere with the function of the product. Overall, I'm satisfied."
4,4 to 13,"had only 4 channels. CBS - 1&2 and NBC - 1&2. put the antenna up and got ABC (19.1, 19.2, 19.3) and PBS (31.1, 31.2, 31.3). If i go a little higher i can get a few more channels. Deffinately worth the money."
5,Works great,This antenna works great. I live in Los Angeles and I have this just sitting in my living room. I get more channels than with my previous antenna that was powered. I am going to mount this on the roof of my building to see if I get better reception but so far it is working great.
3,decent antenna,it doesn't pull in as many channels as I would like but it does get some channels my other antennas didn't-I'm using it for a 2nd antenna for our TV in back. where we live our rooftop antennas pick up about 100 channels-this one about 35 on a clear day
5,A great antenna at a affordable price,This antenna is a great antenna for a small price. It receives many more stations than my old home made 4 bay coat hanger antenna. Picks up stations 45 miles away. This antenna also holds up well in a outdoor environment. I would recommend this antenna to anyone.
5,Comment on TV reception,"Just a quick word on reception. This antenna is design to maximize UHF reception, channels 14-69. VHF is channels 2-13 and rabbit ears will actually do a better job of picking these up. Look up HDTVprimer web site and the will recommend:""Probably the best a renter can do is get a Channel Master 7777 amplifier, connect a DB-2 to its UHF input, and connect rabbit ears to its VHF input. If you are desperate to get a difficult VHF channel, get a 5-element single channel Yagi and suspend it a few inches below the room ceiling.""The DTV2BUHF is a clone of the Antennas Direct DB2 and should have great results, but I've yet to find a detailed review of this model."
2,a challenge for the birds,"This sock is like another one I bought previously, in that it is of a very tough material that makes it difficult for the birds to extract the seeds. I have a companion sock that the finches prefer, and they usually leave this one alone. This is a heavy duty sock that makes the finches work for the seeds."
2,Birds don't like it,"The finches just don't seem to like this sock. Myguess is that the netting is stronger than the othersocks that I have. They fight for position on theother socks and don't go to this one at all (ok,occasionally I will see a bird light on it,but it'srare). I'm not going to fill the other socks andsee if they'll use this one then. I'll update tolet you know what happens."
5,Great Film,This DVD is a short history of modern Israel and Jerusalem and a prophetic history. It is peppered with scripture to show which prophecies have been fulfilled and which are still waiting to be fulfilled. Really an excellent and Biblical treatment of the subject. The filming is interesting with many historic clips of Jewish and other world leaders. Demonstrates the veracity of the Bible.
2,buy something else,"There are plenty of choices, if you're in the market for iPod speakers, and I don't recommend this one. The big problem is the volume control. Polk decided to utilize (+)/(-) buttons for this feature, rather than a continuous control. The effect is that low-level listening (I bought this for my office) is almost impossible. The speakers are either too loud or too quiet. The control itself seems pretty flimsy, since the first unit I received was defective and had to be returned. Polk seems sort of confused about the issue, too. The one-page user manual that accompanies the unit states that the user may have to adjust the iPod volume, along with the miDock volume, to attain a satisfactory volume. The various iPods I've tried on the unit have no effect on the volume (regardless of the iPod volume)."
3,Good overview,"Good over view of Jerusalem time line. Not a lot of in depth detail of events ,but hard to do in one book. Only criticism is to much mention of Saddam and Osama . I always like more maps!"
1,They sent me the wrong book.,"They sent me the wrong book. It wasn't even by LeFanu. I undesrtand $2.40 you get what you pay for, but they sent me a completely different book."
1,Humm...,It doesn't work...really not much more I can say. I am in the process of returning it back to the company...
4,Worked well the first time I tried it!,"I opened this beer line cleaning kit and found the instructions to be accurate & helpful - you basically take off the unit that connects to the keg, along with the spout and soak them in the cleaner solution...the pump works easy, mess-free (as long as your fittings are tight!) & everything seems to be running smooth since I swapped in a new keg!*WARNING - do not stick the pipe cleaner too far into the unit that connects the lines to the keg...there is a little white ball along with a spring at the very top, and if you push the pipe cleaner in too far, you could damage the spring! I was worried I had damaged this when I cleaned mine but the spring clicked back into place after I pushed it up too high!"
4,Works great,"It works as advertised. There's nothing fancy here. I thought it was a little pricey given what it is, but as usual Amazon has a good price compared to a lot of places. Recommended."
5,Fictional Account of a True Heroine,"This is an interesting fictional account of Mother Henriette Delille's life. William Kelley, who also co-wrote the Academy Award winning screenplay for ""Witness"", brings to light the trials of Henriette's desire to break free from her mother's plan of placage, becoming the co-foundress of the first African-American religious order. At first, I was so put off by the sexual violence, that I put the book away for three years. I am so glad I picked it back up!"
4,A Lifetime Labor of Love,"Evidently, Gordon Shriver has been a big fan of one of the greatest actors (not to mention human beings, as we discover) of the 20th Century. Apart from a few too many typos and other printer's errors, this book is an easy to read and thoroughly indexed work for your movie masters' shelves. I was alternately thrilled and awed by the sheer number of people Karloff touched - professionally and personally. Gordon Shriver managed to meet or otherwise correspond with literally dozens of them; their kind and candid obseervations and charming anecdotes bring a fresh perspective to a movie star much maligned. In light of the most recent retrospective of Boris' work, shown at the Film Forum, NYC, this loving tribute will be most welcomed by karloff fans old and new everywhere."
5,Karloff Biography,"A beautifully written biography, the author explores with much affection the actor whose personal life was juxtaposed to ""the monster"" he is best known for portraying. A must-read for horror/terror fans as well as theatre/movie buffs."
5,One of the best commentaries on James!,Douglas Moo is a highly respected commentator with arguably one of the best commentaries out there on the Letter to the Romans. I have also really enjoyed the Pillar New Testament Commentary Series having used their Ephesians and John commentaries as well. I would highly recommend this as a helpful commentary on the letter of James. It contains a lot of information while not being overly technical. It is well presented and easily accessible for all types of people. Obviously you will not agree with every single thing he writes as will be the case with every commentator because none are perfect. The purpose of commentaries is to provide you with someone else's exegesis and research to help you more thoroughly wrestle with what the text of the Bible is saying. I think you will find Moo to be someone who is trying to faithfully exegete and comment on the book of James. Enjoy!
4,my review,"I thought I was purchasing a new keyboard, but it had a refurbished sticker on it. It's working flawlessly. Does'nt seem to have as much spring on keys as the old HP. But the price was quite reasonable. I suppose I could have picked something up from a second hand store, but I believe I made the right choice, being that it's like brand new, and not full of kooties under and around the keys and elsewhere...."
4,Good for the price,"Pretty simple keyboard. Compact and the keys actually make you push, making typing errors less frequent. For the price, doesn't get much better."
3,"Didn't strain my brain, but didn't light my fire","I was looking for a light read when I picked this book up, and as such, it was not terrible. It was not very good, either.The Ex-Files centers on Faye Parker, a model about to be married to her too-good-to-be-true chef fiance. As their wedding approaches, much mayhem is caused by ex-lovers and family and hi-jinx ensue.The writing is passable -- funny, but never laugh-out-loud -- and the characters are never really developed. But my biggest problem with this book is that the NONE of the other characters truly like Faye and several are trying to stop the wedding!Faye is described as difficult, selfish, demanding and a wicked witch...by her own friends and family...but we never really see examples of this. We're just supposed to take this author's word for it.I would still lend this book to a friend looking for an easy beach read, but rather than asking that it be returned to me, I'd happily tell her to keep it."
2,eh,"Girly book,fake drama. I read it 3 weeks ago and i can hardly remember it already. If you have nothing else to read go for it."
2,Jumps Around Too Much,"In my opinion this book jumps around way too much and is a little confusing. It has dialogue for a couple of people, then another couple of people, and then another. I suggest you take notes to keep up with who everyone is and what is going on."
3,NOT GREAT...I don't use this anymore for rice,I bought this because I loved some of my other Pampered Chef items...although they ARE on the expensive side.This is not a great rice cooker. the lid does not make a good seal to lock in the steam to shorten the cooking time. This rice cooker takes as long to cook rice as it does on the stovetop. Other microwave rice cooker I have cooks the rice in half the time.Would NOT recommend as a rice cooker.
1,m vail,"This product is not worth 1.00. I have purchased this item from a Pampered Chef show (came with warrenty) after the first use the top of the rice cooker became deformed. (this is designed to be used in the microwave) It then would not fit properly. Sent it back to Pampered Chef for a repalcement (which they did) the same thing happened again. Sent it back for a refund. Purchased a rice cooker at Walgreens for 9.99 never had a problem. Had it know for over 2 years, and I use it fequently. Not a good product do not buy."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"Please don't make the same mistake I did. Camera died after 1 month of use. Before it died, the pics were of poor quality. Lots of ""white"" flash in every photo, regardless of the lighting adjustments. After the camera died, I contacted Digital Blue. They won't stand behind these over priced poorly made cameras. They wouldn't even entertain the idea that it was a defective product. Disney really needs to end their relationship with Digital Blue."
1,Mala,"Mala no, malisima. Camara muy pobre que lo que hace es hacerte perder tu dinero y frustrar a tu hijo al no lograr sacar una buena foto"
2,not what i wanted,Sorry not what i thought it was size wise too small for my kids. Trying to send back but not getting help in doing that.
3,My 5 year old doesn't know better,"This is a cool camera for kids. The screen is small and hard to see what it is you are shooting, but my 5 year old just points and clicks anyways so it's not that big of a draw back. The pics come out crisp on the computer and the software is easy to navigate. I give it 3 stars based on my standards, but my 5 year old loves it just because it's his first real camera and it's fun to watch him experiment with taking different kinds of pictures. Money well spent indeed."
4,POC-Disney Pix Max,"I found this camera on clearance for $[...]. I bought it for my 8 year old son. We've been playing with it pretty much non-stop. It's a great camera for kids. I don't know what it is the other reviewers have bought, but this camera works fine. My 4 year old is even able to take decent photos with it. We love the view screen! The Disney frames are a lot of fun and easily turned on and off. If I could find a second one for the same price, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. I don't like the idea of paying more than $[...] for a child's camera. It is painful when an $[...] camera gets a bath. But, after having found this camera...it would be painful to spend $[...] for a camera that is not of equal quality."
1,NOT A GOOD BUY!,Okay so these were like a really big deal during Christmas and i still have yet to figure out why. We keep up with all of the new electronics and this is probobly the worst buy weve made. The flash goes off when it feels like it and the button to take the pictue RARELY ever works! Its really that bad.
1,TERRIBLE Camera,"This camera is awful. My father got this camera for my daughter for Christmas on my reccomendation. I read the bad reviews and thought that it couldn't be that bad.....well, it is. The view finder is so dark (even after trying all 3 adjustments) that you can't even make out what you're looking at. That is what kids really want: to see what they are taking a picture of. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! I just returned mine and bought the vtech pink camera (just found pink for the first time at toys-r-us for the first time, thought it was only orange). My nephew has the orange vtech and you can see through the viewer and it is expandable, can take video, play games, and won't break if dropped. Go get the Vtech instead!"
1,Less than one star,"Unfortunately, I didn't do my homework on this one and got burned. This camera is a complete waste, I agree with the other poor reviews."
1,BEWARE- Horrible product plus keylogger spyware,"I would have to agree with the terrible reviews already posted here for this product. In addition, I was unable to use the software to download pictures because I did not allow it to install a nasty keylogger spyware program. DO NOT buy this product, and if you have, fire up some good anti-spyware software, and get your money back. I wish I could give negative stars for this potentially damaging product."
1,Kids Disney Digital Camera,"I bought this camera for my little girl for Christmas, and it is a waste of money. It takes terrible pictures. The photo editing software is decent, but the photos aren't worth bothering to edit. Do not waste money on this camera!"
1,not so good,"I bought this camera and a disney princess one for my daughters. The camera's pictures always turn out blurry and it also has the habit of taking multiple pictures. Since there is no LCD screen you cant see what has been taken or if one was even taken, I ended up with about 10 pictures of my daughters legs."
1,Horrible waste of money,"My son received this as a present for Christmas, and I can't imagine anyone buying this after seeing the already written reviews. DO NOT waste your money. We have not had 1 picture we could use or even see out of this thing. For the money, I don't expect much, but I would have thought we could at least see the images in the photo...but nope!Don't waste your money."
1,I would not have bought this product,"This camara is very small. Easy to loose, and hard to see the picture. I wish I knoew this before I bought it."
1,More Chinese junk flooding the American market.,"We bought two of these cameras for the grandkids, age 5 and 7. Sad to say, neither one of them got any pictures. One camera won't even turn on, the other one downloads pictures via their software and then erases them, everywhere! The pictures disappear. I can't say how the picture quality is because neither camera has produced any."
1,"Another piece of Disney ""Cars"" garbage","My mom got this for my 5 year-old for his birthday. The main interest was that it is a camera, and of course it was a nice bonus that it had the ""Cars"" theme. It is absolute junk. We're currently looking to see if there are any other kid-friendly cameras that will take a half-way decent picture in a similar price-range. You'd be better off just bying a toy camera, at least there is no expectation that you'd get a picture you could make out. If you'd like to get your child another ""Cars"" toy, just get him/her a toy car. So far, I'd say those are the only ""Cars"" toys we have that are well made (assuming of course they don't have lead paint)."
1,never got what i wanted,i wanted the purple camera that said forever a princess o it and they sent me a pink thing with a yellow flower on it. i sent it back and so far they have not credited my account back nor sent me the one i wanted
1,trash,After spending the money with hopes of getting a really small camera that worked good i was very dissapointed. When i delete the pics i have taken the camera sticks on 00. Then it want let me take another pic untill i change the battery. I would really like to know why i have to keep changing the battery to get it to work. I feel like there should be a recall on these cameras. These things cost too much for them not to be backed up with a warenty or a recall. I would never refer this camera to a person to buy. If there is anybody wanting the digital blue 602 disney pix micro cars digital camera i strongly suggest you keep your money in your pocket. These cameras are just trash. I had to give it one star to create this review but if i could i would give it a minus 5 star.
1,"To small , not what I was expecting , very disappointed ...","Too little, I was expecting at least a medium size camera. Is too small that you can close your hand and it disappear. Wast of money. 4 tumbs down"
1,Don't waste your money.,I didn't realize how many bad reviews were on this camera. I had seen some great reviews on it and bought it for my son for Christmas. The program won't even download onto our computer even though we have all that it needs to do so. It doesn't have a screen so that he can see what shots he got. It is a simple waste of money. I am not pleased at all. I am now going to have to go and get him another one and just toss this one.
1,Digital Blue 741 Disney Pix Click Pirates III Digital Camera,Don't even waste your time with this.Picture quality is a P.O.S.There are better products in the market for ab out the same price.
1,Disappointed,I would NOT recommend this camera. The screen to view the pictures is extremely small. The few pictures we took were not clear on the viewer and its very cheaply made. It is not worth the money.
1,Returned quickly,"Really a piece of junk. The software it comes with is fairly good but not worth it. No flash, the viewfinder was way off so in the event you did get a good picture the person's head was cut off. You really can't take a picture with these and expect it to turn out. My girls liked them, they looked cool but an absolute piece of junk. You had to have a very steady hand to get a picture that wasn't blurred. My girls didn't have that steady hand. Thankfully the store took them back with no questions. Save yourself a hassel and just don't buy them."
3,Ok... not the best.,"Ok, this camera is not the best camera you will ever buy. My kids are 8 and 5, and I do not think they are really concerned about number of pixels and grainy images; they just have fun taking pictures of anything and then using the software to download and decorate their funny faces. If you are looking for a good quality camera, shop for something else; but if you want an inexpensive camera with pre-teen and child appeal you've just found it. The computer software is included!! Great looking, and FUN!"
1,Poor. Very disappointing.,"My kids are always stealing my expensive Canon digital camera, so I bought 2 of these Disney cameras for them. They like to photograph silly things like their feet, their toys, and their lunch. This Disney camera is not even applicable to such silly-fun photography. I was fair warned that the pictures would be grainy when downloaded (only 1 megapixel), but I hoped that the act of photographing stuff would be a fun activity for the kids. No so. The LCD screen on the back of the camera is completely useless, as you can barely even make out objects within 1-2 feet away. When preparing to take a picture, you must hold the camera very still and about 12 inches from the subject. When using such a technique, you will be able to make out the outline of the object, at best. After the kids gave the cameras a try and discovered that the LCD images were impossible to decipher, the cameras were left in the bottom of the toy box. Do not waste money on this camera."
2,Not worth it,"Picture quality is horrible and that's with decent light. Forget anything darker than a very bright room.The overlay thing can be kind of fun for the kids but the almost indistinguishable photo part will keep it from lasting.It's fairly sturdy, more than a standard camera anyway.You're better off getting a used 1 or 2 megapixel camera at the same price.For some reason I can't give this thing less than 2 stars. It really only gets a 1 from me."
1,Piece of junk,"This camera may be good for kids, but they can take better quality pictures on a cell phone. The viewing screen is terrible. The flash isn't very good either. You need to take the pictures in a room with tons of light or outside in the bright sun. I was very disappointed, and I doubt this camera will ever be used."
1,Terrible product,The pictures are horrible. It is not worth the money. You can not even make out what you are taking a picture of on the display. Don't waste your money.
3,Smaller than i expected,I bought this camera despite the bad reviews cause let's face it for as little as $10 your not going to get much for you money. But my 5 yrs daughter wants a camera and I thought this would be a great starter one. It arrived in the condition that was expected (new) but i was shocked to see how small it actually is. If it wasn't for the wrist strap i doubt my daughter would be able to find this camera when she puts it down. Let's hope that the picture will turn out ok. But then again its a cheap camera can't expect it to work like my Kodak.
1,Do not Buy if you are a MAC Owner,This will not work with a MAC computer. I called the customer care people and they basically told me to buy a PC! Yea like I am going to go buy a PC for this crappy little camera!
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The picture quality stinks. WHen downloaded, they are all black!!!! Even when taken in extreme bright light.!!!!!! I will never buy another disney product. What a rip-off. A sheer disgrace."
4,Great!,Got this as a first camera and he loves it! He took over 200 pictures on Christmas! Easy to use and operate.
1,not worth the money,"I bought this camera for my 6 year old. I tried to get a cute camera that still fuctioned as well as a ""real"" digital camera. The LCD screen is what you use for the viewfinder, which would be fine if it ever focused. Basically, the LCD screen is horrible. I have not loaded the pictures on my laptop yet, so I don't know if it actually takes good pictures or not, but as of right now, I am really unhappy with this camera. I wish that I would have skipped the cute pink color and just went for function. My daughter is disappointed in the camera as well. She prefers to use my old digital camera (8 years old and still works better than this one)."
1,Not the best camera.,"This camera was purchased for Christmas for our daughter. My daughter does not even use this camera after she has wanted a camera for so long.The screen is very small and the pictures are not clear at all. This camera in not worth the price it is retailed for. I would not recommend this camera. I am very disappointed with this product. It would be better to purchase a regular digital camera for your money's worth. You are paying for the Disney name, not the quality of the camera."
1,THIS CAMERA STINKS!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS JUNKY CAMERA. I got this camera as a Christmas gift so I did not see the reviews until I visited this website. What a waste of $50! The pictures are grainy and washed out. The LCD is so small, and dark that you cannot even see the subject of the picture. The SW did not work. We returned the camera immediately and got our money back."
2,Not so good for younger children,The camera is nice but tiny & it doesn't have a viewer (little kids like to see the pictures even when they are blurry or if they took a photo of the dog's tail)That's why I don't recommend it for younger children.
1,Huge disappointment,"As if you need yet another poor review to tell you to save your money and NOT buy this camera. I found myself wishing I could give this camera 0 stars! The image quality on the LCD is so poor - you cannot even tell what the photo was supposed to be of! Once downloaded, the pictures are grainy - as expected due to the low resolution. If you do not hold the camera perfectly still, the image is blurred beyond recognition. And let's face it - what 6 (or 7 or 8 or . . . ) can hold perfectly still for any amount of time? Do not buy this camera. It will frustrated you as well as your young, budding photographer!"
1,piece of junk,"My 10 year old son got this camera for his b-day. He took tons of pictures while out of town, and once home we tried to load them on my computer. The software would not recognize that the camera was plugged in and after searching the internet I finally had to uninstall and download from the digital blue website. Once we saw the pictures we were so disapointed, all of the outdoor photos (about 90% of the pictures) had an overhelming purple hue to them. The indoor pictures were ok, as long as the camera was not too close to the subject (because the flash would white out the subject). Save your money, do not buy this camera."
1,Absolute garbage,"I bought this camera last year for my then six year old son. The camera has no flash and can basically only be used outdoors. Even then, the shots are extremely blurry. I'd be embarrassed to give this thing away. Pay a few extra bucks and get a camera that works."
2,Poor quality photos,I'm surprised that they couldn't get better quality photos in a $50 camera. The quality looked like my RAZR phone years ago. The flash made the photos way too bright and actually worked better without. My 8yr old loves taking pictures but it would be so much better if it took good pictures.
3,Lovely camera for kids,"this is lively camera for kids , but the screen is too small , and the resolution of the screen is really bad , but my daughter love it .."
2,Good for a really young child,"For those who said this camera does not have a flash - they are wrong. It has a flash. Someone also said it only holds 35 pictures. Wrong again. We had 145 pictures on his camera before I moved them over to the computer and it was not out of space. I recommend only getting this for a small child. It does have a display to see the picture, but it is very small."
1,Horrible camera,"We ordered this camera for our nephew and the princess version for our daughter. When they arrived, we were totally surprised by their size, they are so small they fit in the palm of your hand. It is more like a toy than a camera. The next surprise was that they don't work with our computer's operating system, so we needed to return it, our nephew did have a windows based pc, but based on the quality of the camera we returned both of them for a full refund. It is just not worth the money, even though it is inexpensive to begin with."
1,Awful,"We bought this for our son, a fan of Cars and also a kid who always wants to use the digital camera and wants to see the picture after it is taken. We had wanted the Fisher-Price camera that was sold out everywhere. The LCD display is awful, cannot make out the subject when you are taking a picture nor when reviewing. The pictures are all terrible - put them on the computer today - both those taken by our child and those taken by the parents. He can easily take a decent photo with my old Canon S 110 and with my cell phone.So, let's hope that Best Buy will take this back!"
1,waste of money,"I purchased this for my son, after buying one on constructive playthings for xmas that turned out to be junk. The first cars camera didnt even work so I took it back and exchanged for another... it wasnt even compatable with my Vista computer so I couldnt even download the software, you couldnt even tell when you were taking pictures, total waste and now I find myself looking for another one . . . ugh"
4,.....Speedy Thrash Metal.....,"An LA band that sounds like Suicidal Tendencies.They play straight-forward 80's speed/thrash type metal. Amery Smith who beat the drums on this album also drummed for Suicidal Tendencies.I have always enjoyed this album although I bought it years after it came out.The album is just a fun listen {funny cover too I, Love this cover art.}, not one thing is original here except the cover art but a thrash metal fan should enjoy.I still love to put this cd in and play it.They do a cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Dazed and Confused"" here as well.Can't beat the price here, so give it a Try."
1,Error codes after 1 year and warranty expires.,"The formatter boards are known to go out in these printers (model P3005n). Our company has replaced 2 out of approx. 8 printers and now our 3rd is failing. Error code 49.4C2D and 49.4C.02 = not fun. I'm still getting quotes, but the board itself runs about $300.00 from what I'm hearing, not including labor/installation.I'm afraid the on/off switch is going to break for how many times I've had to restart the printer to get it to ""ready"" status. Sometimes it gets stuck ""Initializing..."", sometimes it's stuck with ""Hp"" on the screen. Sometimes the error codes. This has been occurring all week, (today is 5/7/09) and our warranty expired 4/27/09. Prior to the last month though this printer has performed well. In other words, it's good for about a year.We do minimal printing here, just payroll checks once a week and an occasional single print here and there, so I would not recommend this printer."
1,junk,"I agree with K. Roche - it's good for about a year. Well less actually, our first was replaced under warranty after about a month, now its replacement, 3 months out of warranty, has gone down with the same errors mentioned by K. Roche. Too expensive in parts and time to fix, I'm looking for a replacement. It won't be a HP!"
5,Good printer,Our company has bought three of these printers within the last year and none have failed yet like the other reviews. One of the printers is in our payroll department where we print 300 payroll checks each week off it. So far we haven't had any jammed paper on it.We run our printers on Vista Business 64bit and Windows Server 2003 environments.I would recommend this product.
5,"Good, stable, simple work horse.","We bought 1 long time ago and it had been proven to be very reliable so when other printers retired we bought 3 more even though HP had discontinued the model. Then we bought this one, came from Japan, I think this might still not being discontinued in other markets..."
1,13 Months = Dead,It's frustrating to see all these reviews. Our experience with the printer was perfectly satisfactory until the rollers started making a nasty crunching noise a month ago. I just checked the purchase date on Amazon and it was October 08. Terrible.
2,Died within 6 months,"We bought 2 of these and they were great until they started having issues with our server. Then one of them completely quite working, our tech said it is not worth fixing."
2,From Julia Childs Kitchen,"Was not really very user friendly. Very difficult to follow, unrealistic for the every day woman & fixing family meals."
4,Cooking Text Book,"Informal American cook book for the regular woman to learn indepth knowledge and variations of popular foods. Julia has tested each recipe multiple times and recreated on her television series. The Masterings books on French cooking were ground breaking for Americans; however, this book is unusal because the recipes can be trusted to be successful and less complicated in preparation of meals. The text is informative and delightfully entertaining -- her personality comes through on the pages."
5,The cookbook once you've finished Mastering...,This is my favorite Julia Child cookbook. To me it is a bit more personal than 'Mastering'. It seems like the recipes are there to enjoy not impress. These are the recipes that Julia made for Paul on nights when there was nothing special going on. Following the recipes in this book feels more like you've gone to Aunt Julia's house to spend the weekend rather than taking a cooking course from Mrs. Child. The recipe for 'Sauteed Chicken Breasts with Tomatoes and Tarragon' is my go-to recipe. It is delicious and never fails to impress. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do.
5,Getting good at it,"This is Julia's first not-totally-French cookbook. The very first recipe, Potage Bonne Femme, is a leek and potato soup that I know is a show stopper. (I know because I have ""stopped the show"" at my house and my office with its aroma several times!) Her instructions are detailed for the novice cook, but paragraphed in such a way that the practiced chef can jump through ordinary techniques to get to the crux of the recipe. This is the book that started my wife and I on our culinary adventures. Here is a guidebook for the reader to ""cut a new swath"" through the kitchen."
5,Julia Child,I'v always wanted a Julia Child cookbook. This is not only educational but entertaining as well. It's a fun book to read and learn from.
1,Wrong item but no info in the description.,"This is a good item, just too bad they did NOT give the proper years for the product in the description. It said for Dodge Ram 2500/3500 and that is exactly what I needed. Got the order in and opened the box.... doesn't fit. On the box it says 03 - 12 but we have a 2000 model Dodge. NOT COOL people. I checked to see if it fit with Amazon's ""does this fit your vehicle"" drop downs and it said it did!So, be careful when ordering if they don't give a year model.I could only give the seller a 1 star for NOT giving proper information on year coverage."
3,the ultimate British koi,"for 25.oo i was disappointed in the book.. the sections of filtering were not up to date.. not much on additives..seems to be an opinionated upper crust British who sees things his way..he doesnt understand why every one can't afford a 5000 gallon concrete pond.and multiple filters. i guess what i wanted was THE AFFORDABLE KOI BOOK with pictures on how to buy better koi , ie why some are better than others.. how to keep the green in your wallet and out of the pond.....wasn't this book...."
2,Very Outdated,This book is very outdated. It does have maps but they are not detailed. The directions to sites are humorous to say the least. A good example is on page 30 the directions say take route 60 west 4 miles on your right you will see a tree turn on the second dirt road. One can only guess how many trees have grown since the publishing of this book. There are only 3 color pages in this book to identify what you are looking for.
1,Boring and dull.,I found this book to be disappointing. I did not see it as a motivator at all. If you have the will-power to quit smoking than you can manage to stay thin without this book.
4,Ultimately it takes salespeople to drive business,"Thomas Siebel has a great vision for what many corporate bureaucracies cloud over with endless data analysis...it takes real salespeople, on the street, selling the business to succeed. IT systems are meant to help in a number of different ways but ultimately they must exist to move sales forward and not drag them down. Siebel explains how companies can benefit from the data collection and analysis while empowering the salesforce to sell."
2,Reasonable introduction to Sales IT issues,Readable book suitable for those interested in introduction to high level sales concepts and a 1995 view of anticipated impact of technology on selling.
1,Really weird,This was not very helpful. Stick with regular yoga! Looks like a homemade video and not very professional. One of my clients suggested trying to get a refund.
2,Ordered DVD recieved book instead,Not a happy camper to recieve book instead of dvd.Don't have time to return things or even read books.Maybe I will try to reorder. Lots of pictures of exercisesin book. Probably good for a bad back. I felt beat.
3,not the most updated,"Probably not the most updated dvd to be released and this would've been good to know. Although the exercises are virtually the same, there have been adjustments and eliminations since this dvd was published. The exercises on the more recent dvd have been streamlined and are more accessible to all physical levels."
3,Didn't work for me.,I tried out these exercises and I couldn't seem to induce the tremors at all. I ended up giving my video to a friend. Bummer.
4,Herb Mill Review,The mill is well made and nicely finished. It has a lever to lock the top in place while you crank. I was slighhtly disappointed that it had plastic cutters. It would be an improvemtn to have metal or ceramic but alos probably increase the cost.
2,Herb Grinding Mill,"I was disappointed with this product as it crushed the fresh herbs more than chopped them! Not for smaller quantities such as a ""Pinch"". When the hopper is very full, the results are better."
1,review of herb mill,I was disappointed in the herb mill. The herbs stuck in the plastic blades and the locking clip broke the first time I used it. I found that I wasted more herbs than if I chopped them with a knife. Clean up of the mill was easy however.
4,Quite Full of Twists,This movie was very good. The plot is excellent with a twists here and there that keep you glued. Christine Lahti is excellent in the role of the wife.
1,Disappointed...,"I really like all the cast members in this film. However, I cannot believe I put myself through this movie! I wasn't ironing, but I did finally pick up my laptop and do a search for a better movie. This movie just had too many loose ends."
5,yum!!!,"I love the Slim Jim Beef Jerky, so this is an easy review to write. After months of watching store after store stop carrying this product, I was getting concerned if I could find it anywhere, locally, to satisfy my craving. I was happy to find a supplier on Amazon. The price was great and I got it quickly. I will be ordering regularly from you guys...Thanks,Dan"
1,Not very good,"Doesn't taste much like teriyaki. Hard as a rock and loaded with salt. Maybe I just got 12 bad pouches, but I will be looking elsewhere for jerky in the future."
4,Bears Of the Wild!!!!,"This book is touching. The animal is abused but then is loved by Mark. Once he goes out he gets happy. They are afraid he'll turn wild again, but he stayss tame. It was sad when they let him go, but i am happy that he iss not endangered anymore and can eat his fill... This was a great book(RECOMENDED)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Gentle Ben,"I think ""Gentle Ben"" is an amazing book. It is a story of animal survival and the relationship between a boy and a bear.""Gentle Ben"" is a serious book but some parts are hilarious.My favorite part is when Karl Anderson's ship Far North,was sinking. It was intense. I didn't know if the father would survive.I would recommend this book to 4th thru 8th grade because the language is difficult to read."
5,A beautifully written work!,"This is one book I've had for many years, but it wore out, so I got a new copy, because I enjoy the story so much. It is a well written story about a seemingly unlikely and impossible relationship between a boy and a bear, and what's great is that the author doesn't ""Disney-ize"" the story, for there is also tragedy as well as the lighter moments. I especially enjoyed the way the author made his characters so convining and real, from the despicable and loathsome Fog Benson to the affectionate yet firm Mike Kelly. It is also a refreshing story in that Mark, the boy, also learns what it means to have a great responsibilty in having a bear. The author does a great job in portraying right as right, and wrong as wrong, yet isn't ""preachy"" about it. It's a book you can't put down the first time you read it. It is one of my favorite works of fiction, and though I am now an adult, I still enjoy reading this book. It's one I highly recommend for all to read."
2,"Good history, little else","Dan was my first serious teacher 18 years ago. I have moved on from him to better masters, but I appreciate what he did for me, and I respect his intent, but this book fails as so many tai chi books does, because it's a series of useless photos. How do you get from one posture to the next? The essence of taoism is change, and these postures are static. Even if it was a video, it's pointless. You need a teacher to hit you! He should have written a book just on the history, because that is the strongest part of the book."
2,"Only good for simple word doc, not for any pics","WEll, it is okay but Bad if you use it with some photos, I called HP ask why it stuck on a error light, it won't print a photo that I have that was pretty small in size. They told me this printer is mostly for simple documents only not for anything has photo in it. I can't remember what the maximum size of the document. You would also have problem printing from internet if it is larger files. Hard to figure the many error lights on the printers as well if you don't have the manual handy."
1,"very weird cut, cheap; hat to return it","the cut of this coat was weird, even though it was my size, the shoulders were ultra wide. The coat felt cheap, you get what you pay for.Amazon lured me in with an e-mail advertising a large discount.4 weeks later they discounted the price another 30% (probably because they couldn't get rid of it).Probably won't buy clothes from Amazon again."
1,Odd fit,This coat fit very strangely. The shoulders were too broad and I found that I could not lift my arms up without the entire jacket shifting upwards. It almost felt as if they expected my shoulders to be about four inches lower than they are. I returned this thing almost immediately.
1,Runs Big,"This coat definitely runs big, and has strange cut. When you wear it, it feels like you can't lift your arms to 90 degree angle. You get what you pay for (70% discount probably the reason for it). I am returning it!"
3,Okay for the price,"This is one low end coat. It certainly does not look like a $500 cost (not even $200). But for the price of $50, it is okay."
2,Nice coat but wierd sizing,"I really wanted this coat to fit. It was nice material and weight and the stitching was good. I'm 6'-4 and wear a 43 long with a 37 inch sleeve. The sleeves on the Large size were almost right, just a little short. But the chest size was huge, fit more for Arnold Schwarzenegger, not a normal person.Sadly, I returned it. If you're a wrestler, boxer or weightlifter, this coat might work for you."
2,nice material/lining/price...horrible fit,"the sleeves are way too short and its way too big in the body, terrible cut."
5,Spot on,"This is a clear and easy to read text for protein purification and would readily recommend it is as an introductory guide to this area. Also to the experienced researcher there are many hints and tips, which were extremely helpful to me."
1,waste of money,"This video was horrible. The pictures on the front cover are misleading, none of the shots on a beautiful hilltop or even outside, it takes place in a large public convention room with crazy busy casino looking carpet, the two instructors read from notes the whole time and were unrehearsed and unorganized. They continually referenced the viewer to look at outlines, figures in the hand outs and reading material that aren't available to anyone purchasing the video. The sound quality was poor and continued to go lounder, then softer during the entire video and included static and muffled voices from the instructors microphones. I assumed that for the price of the video, the TRIADBALL was included but it wasn't, even if you have a fitness ball, the exercises in this video are just demonstrational, you don't actually get a work out. There is a reason you can't find a review of this video anywhere! I have no idea why it is so expensive."
3,nice,"This ring was very well made. I bought it for my daughter, but the flower was to big and gawdy for her."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I was so looking forward to this CD,it is very scratchy,singer does not sound like Sunny Ozunavery disappointed in qualitySonny,i remember the dances in Chicago,this does not sound like you"
3,variable,"Entertaining as always: a mixed season, with some hits and some misfires.First, forgo new agers for a while. They are absurd to the point of being impaired. Season six seems fatigued: sensitivity, dolphins and the like echo earlier episodes. Balance becomes an issue for this season, with acrimony working into some material--the Being Green episode was off kilter and strident.It would be good to see more shows about things we accept as mainstream but do in fact have faulty joints. Stranger Danger made a bold point that child protection has become Manichean. The series really hits target with episodes like these.The writers might consider lightening up on ideology and focusing on deconstructing things commonly accepted, such as the prison system, litigation culture (the root of political correctness), dumbed down reality TV and the like.Certainly there are enough contradictions out there to re-energize the series."
5,Excellent.,"If you like Penn & Teller, and have any familiarity with this show, you'll definitely want to own this modern classic."
3,"Very classy, but not up to par","First of all, this is a beautiful watch. I owned one for a total of one month and got lots of compliments.I wished it had a second hand and a date feature, because I find those very useful, but it was a very nice watch, so it wasn't a huge sacrifice. The main problem I had though, was the paint started coming off in patches on the mesh band. I don't want to say this is true of all their colored watches, but I returned mine to the store after only having it for one month.I just bought a titanium band one that looks the same, but I don't expect the coloring to come off this one. I really like this brand, but a few problems exist from my experience."
1,low quality parts,"I purchased this watch 6 months ago. All of a sudden, one day I noticed a crack right in the middle of the crystal! I have never dropped it or hit it anywhere nor was there ever an aggressive wear/tear situation. I have an office job and at home I have never banged it anywhere! Now that crack has spread and formed new cracks long its track too. It is no longer under warrently and when I contacted Skagen, they say I have to mail it via insured mail, pay $8 for a technician to look at it and if problem with crystal, pay another $30 to replace it! What junky quality is that! And the watch itself was no cheap either! I got better mileage with my previous $20 Timex watch!!"
4,Informative,This book saved my life! It had the most information on Laws pertaining specifically to business.
1,It's Books Like This That Give Romance Books A Bad Rep!,"I usually really enjoy reading these types of romance books that have short stories by different writers so when I saw this book in a store I picked it up and purchased it and I hated it! This book just wasn't for me because I thought it was horrible and a big waste of money but I respect that other reviewers have actually enjoyed reading this book as after all everyone is entitled to their own opinions. BTW: I have read better stories by Dunne, Hocker and Landsdowne in other romance books. It's books like this that give the romance genre a bad name!"
5,The covedr says it all.,"What can you say about a book that has you hanging on every word and getting through it in less than a day? You say it's great! It's more than that! If you haven't discovered this writer, you're missing out. What a ride this story takes you on!"
5,Sleep with the lights on.,"If you don't want to be scared out of your mind, don't read this, but if you enjoy a fast read, a great story with a fantastic twist--all with religious overtones--then get this book. Dynamite! I read everything this author writes. She's damn good."
5,So You're Looking for a New Preacher,"The book is outstanding! Writing in a clear and pointed style, the author distills the wisdom she has gained in thirty years of experience as a preacher and a teacher of preaching.At last, a practical, readable guide and help for congregations seeking a new Pastor. The wisdom in this book could save a church or a ministry. Any pulpit or pastor search committee will be grateful to have a guide such as this.Also, I would like to express my appreciation to Amazon.com for making this book available. I served on a pulpit committee 7 years ago and this book was invaluable. I gave my book to a friend. Now that I am in need of a new one, I thought it would be difficult to locate. Thanks Amazon!Many churches, pulpit committees and ministries will be greatly helped by this book."
1,Pero...,"La película no está mal, pero la porquería que hizo Venevisión con los subtítulos NO TIENE NOMBRE! Los subtítulos en inglés están ""montados"" sobre el video y no hay forma de quitarlos como en cualquier otro DVD decente. Absolutamente inaceptable. Nunca más pienso volver a comprar películas de Venevisión, dan pena."
4,Fun and Funny,"I've been reading Taibbi for a few years now, going back to his first book ""The eXile: Sex, Drugs and Libel in the New Russia,"" which he co-wrote with his former partner at their Moscow newspaper. ""Spanking The Donkey"" is a fun and funny book, easily the best account of last year's sham presidential campaign, told in the gonzo style of a Hunter Thompson. Whereas in his previous book Taibbi played the straight man role to co-author Ames' druggie-wildman, this time around he's changed his tune and seems to be playing the role of angry drug-fueled gonzoid, so ""Spanking"" is a departure for those of you who expect Taibbi to play the same role this time as in his first book. For me personally I enjoyed Taibbi's new incarnation most of the time, though admittedly I found myself wondering if he was just acting or if for his next book he'll be adopting some other persona. One thing is for sure: whether or not Taibbi is an imitator, he is about the best there is today."
2,Not as expected,"I picked up this book after seeing Matt interviewed on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The interview was very entertaining and Matt seemed an interesting guy. I bought the book, thinking it would give me a different perspective and be an easy read, but it was not as expected. The book does have some interesting thoughts, but is so clouded by a drug haze it's difficult to get the message Matt is trying to convey."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"I ordered this book because I thought Matt Taibbi would be as informative and accurate as his father. It was a complete mess, instead of a factual report on the 2004 election it was comprised of drug scenarios and vile language! I am wondering after the many books on the 2000 election, ( I bought many of them) why isn't there more about election 2004? Could it be that the Bush Haters still can't accept the fact that he won?"
1,The company is a sham,"I ordered this book about 2 years ago, received many emails about the book still arriving, and it never came. The email nor the phone number works. Do not waste your time or money. I am sure the book would have been great if the company followed through with their promise, but I don't even think there is a real company. I have contacted the Better Business Bureau with no further information."
4,A great collection of photos,This is a smart idea and a fun layout. It really does make you chuckle!
2,Disappointed!,"I recently bought this product because of all the extra benefits it said it had. If you buy a leap link to go with it you can customize it to meet your childs needs. You can also keep track of how well your child is doing. You can download new games and activites. Well guess what, NONE of these capablities are ready yet. I e-mailed their technical support and they said their web site won't be ready to do all of this until maybe mid-november. So basically they are selling a product that is not ready yet. Isn't that called false advertising? If you are thinking about buying this product WAIT! It does have great potential. I just think they should of waited to put it on the market until their product was ready to do ALL it said it could do!!"
5,great learning toy,"I bought a turbo twist math for my 7 year old daughter last christmas and i am thrilled with the results. The progress reports and the up grades that you can get off the web site are fantastic and a great way to keep it interesting for her and to inform me of how well she is doing. My hat goes off to the creators of this wonderful learning ""toy"". I will be purchasing the spelling version of the ""game"" soon. Thank you everyone at leap frog."
1,TURBO (NOT) TWIST MATH,"I bought this for my child to help her with her math facts better. I am pretty disappointed (I should have listened to my husband!) Flash cards would be just as effective and a lot less expensive. It is cumbersome to use and is not fast, even I can only answer 11 facts in 90 seconds (and it is not because I don't know them). I thought it would have be fast and have a snappy beat (along the lines of the Bop It Game. I was wrong on both accounts. It lost its appeal after about 1 hour."
1,NOT A GOOD TOY!,"I would definitely not recomend this toy to ALL. It's not worth its cost. My daughter bought a Turbo Twist Maths. She plays with it then after a few minutes puts it down and says that she's bored. She has played with this toy various times and has finished all of the questions so that everything is repeating over and over again. All Leapfrog toys are like this, NEVER EVER BUY THEM."
4,A great way to learn math,"My mom got this toy for me for Christams. It helped me alot in math. It has addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimals, percentages, fractions and word problems. It will help your kids alot."
1,Discouraging Math Toy,I am very disappointed in the Turbo Twist Math product. The skill level can only be adjusted for the Learn It mode. This mode only displays questions and answers without any interaction from the child. The questions asked in other quiz modes range from 2+3 to 81 + 256. My child was very frustrated. Even a child that could answer 81 + 256 in their head would not want to work through the 2+3 questions. Not being able to adjust the skill level on all modes is a huge design fault. This toy was a waste of money!
5,An Exceptional Educational Toy - Math Turbo twist,"My son is seven years old and he could count to 100 when he was in kindergarten,as his 27 year old brother could also. Both children were and are very quiet about what they are capable of doing, but school was very boring to both. My oldest would come to me for the level he was on to continue, as his teachers did not ""see"" what I told them until half of the school year was over. The Turbo Twist Math would have been a wonderful toy for him to own. My seven year old has the advantage of owning it. It gives positive reinforcement, challenges whatever level the child is at, works with addition, subtraction,multiplication, word problems and division. It is personalized as it enters the child's name and the child coordinates reading of the screen, following directions and using fine motor skills to operate the toy.There are cartridges for the toy to grow with the child's stage of development. Mrs. Symmington"
3,Not worth the investment,"Overall, this toy is kind of cool. I read a review that said that it is ""not any better than flash cards"" prior to purchase, and I stubbornly ignored that advice, thinking that my technology loving kid would be fooled into thinking he is playing a game. But it really isn't any better than flash cards, or any of the $5 and under math apps for an ipad. We fortunately bought this used, so it was comparatively cheap, and I can't imagine why this toy is ever worth $100."
4,Very good strategies,"For beginning traders there's a lot of information out there. There are dozens of patterns, oscillators, and indicators; at first each one seems like it's going to be great, but after a few losing trades, a person gets confused about how to proceed and just what indicators to use.The great thing about this book is the emphasis on STRATEGIES -- this approach places indicators and oscillators in their proper role as tools that are subservient to strategy. As a beginning technical trader faced with a bewildering minefield of tools, it wasn't until I started using these strategies that I started making some money in the uncertain market we are currently in.The book does seem somewhat thin -- the text and figures are LARGE, as if trying to take up more space. There could have been a bit more background and info provided, I suppose. I also don't understand why the man won't use candlesticks, which I find much more intuitive than bars. But in the main I've found it very helpful."
1,Terrible Waste of Money!,"I bought this book because of the rave reviews it received here, so I am writing this to let others know they should not be deceived as I was. If this book cost $10 I MIGHT say it was worth the money, but essentially it was 170 pages of large print and screen shots, all illustrating examples of one strategy (not 10), which can be boiled down to:1) Trade with the trend.2) Enter following a pullback after resumption of the trend."
4,inspiring narrative,"For the historically inclined, Smith manages to wonderfully recreate a San Francisco that he and we have never experienced. But through extensive research and adroit storytelling, he makes San Francisco of 1906 come alive. You can feel the chaos and terror induced by the earthquake and subsequent fires.But the sheer vitality of the city's inhabitants shines through. Something to well remember when [not if] there is the next quake."
3,Needs. Maps,The various positive reviews of this book do a good job but I had a hard time following the story because there are no maps. The personalities involved were described well but for someone unfamiliar with San Francisco maps would have made this book much more engaging. I was glad to finish and move on.
3,Where are the fire fighters,"This book read too much like a soap opera. For a book that was supposed to be a new take on the disaster, it offered nothing new; too much time spent on the rampant political corruption and the power struggle between upper-class San Franciscans. While it started out strong, it's cliff hanger chapter enders and its switch to the story of Abe Ruef and the rampant corruption of San Francisco left me feeling like I just wasted my time. If I were teaching a course on California History I would definitely NOT use this book. This is lazy history. This book should serve as a launch pad for actual historians to write a complete history of the 1906 disaster from the fire fighters stand point. If you want a fascinating disaster book you should read Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919 by Stephen Pulo. This was a truly fascinating and well-researched book. San Francisco is Burning is fine as throwaway history but it needed more."
5,A great product...,"I purchased the Sony STR-DE898 FM Stereo/FM-AM Receiver after my older Sony finally kicked the can. In addition, I ramped up my speaker system to 7.1 surround in the process. I now have Dolby Digital surround sound on my DirecTV DVR and my Sony DVD player. The receiver is relatively easy to use and has a plethera of input and output connections. I am very happy I purchased this receiver and Amazon.com had it for a very reasonable price. I would highly recommend this receiver for the cost-concious buyer looking to find good quality and features without breaking the bank."
3,Sony just lives off its name...,"...about the only things it still does really well is TV and video cameras; its computers, home and car audio are mediocre at best.The main selling point of its audio is convenience and ease of use, but sound quality and long term reliability are poor. Its top of the line ES series is much better but hideously overpriced compared to what else is available in the same price bracket.I have heard all of these low-level STR receivers and you can do much better with Pioneer, Yamaha or even Onkyo for the same price range. Along with those 3 other brands, Sony is notorious for ludicrously inflating its watts per channel numbers, which unfortunately is the main thing that newbies to audio look at.For 250 bucks the all-digital Panasonics sa-xr55 easily crushes all of these (Sony, Pioneer, Yamaha and Onkyo) with one hand tied behind its back though...that's what I'd try first. Well I can say one thing for these Sonys, at least they are not as bad as Bose."
2,"worked great for a while, then the problems started","I've had this unit for about three years now. It sounded great, and worked just fine for a while, but then one day, the TV monitor output just stopped working..And now the left front speaker connection has become intermittent. I believe there's a cold solder joint at the speaker output jack. I'm not looking forward to disconnecting the whole thing, tearing it apart, and resoldering that connection.The remote is pretty lacking, too. Some of the functions of the unit, like A/B speaker selection are not available from the remote, and the layout of the remote is busy and confusing."
3,Not too bad,I've had this receiver for 5 years and it's still going strong! Great sound. The remote and instructions are unnecessarily difficult but it's worth learning to operate the features. I use it for my stereo system so I can't comment on the DVD capabilities. Lots and lots of hookup capabilities in back.
5,Great sound for the price,"I bought this receiver when it was on sale for $280. I also bought the Sony SA-VE367T 7.1-Channel Surround Speaker System to go along with it. Let me tell you, for the price this sounds great. I know there are systems that sound better, but you're going to have to pay a whole lot more than this. Definately recommended!"
5,If your looking for 100% propagation in a inexpesive Hot House this is worth every penny,"I bought this setup for it's simplicity and dome height, heat mat, and cubes. I have found in the past a cheap trick for 100% propagation with this system. Weather you purchase here on Amazon or at Home Depot/Lowe's. Buy the cheapest maybe even cracked two 12"" x 12"" floor tiles and place the heat mat on top of them, then the dome tray on top of heat mat. What this does for the cuttings is allow the roots to cool slowly and still grow with the free warmth of the tiles. It works every time for my cuttings or seedlings. Try it it works! Best of luck!I have no moisture dripping outside of the tray everything stays inside as it should."
2,Go to Lowes instead,I got this from Amazon because they were hard to find locally. Dont you know it Lowes and Home Depot have started carrying them now for the same price. This does not have the grow media with it so I had to go to Lowes to get some starter soil for it where I saw Lowes had started carrying them and they had the media included.Yeah I was pissed. This one has a taller dome which was a major attraction for me but the moisture condenses on the dome runs down the sides and pours out of the planter as the dome lip sits on the outside of the tray. So if you have this in the house its gonna make a mess unless you put the tray in a bigger tray to catch the water. So buy it locally that way if you dont like it its easy to return.
4,Simple and effective device.,"This Hydrofarm hothouse with heat mat is a simple and effective way to start your plants from seed. The heat mat in particular will last you years and years most likely. The hothouse itself is of questionable manufacture, being a flimsy plastic, but it does what it is supposed to perfectly. There is a vent on top and one to either side of it as well to help control the temp and humidity if you dont use a guage. The 72 seed cells are likewise nothing special, but are again, quite effective. I have placed a variety of seeds in this, from tomatoes, to peppers to quinoa to tobacco, and everything tends to spout within 4 to 7 days. Anyways, even though of flimsy manufacture, the price is right and the goods are effective, so i give this 4 stars accordingly. Just be gentle with it, and if necessary, save the mat in the event that you damage the hothouse.Enjoy!"
4,Hydrofarm with heat mat,This works. Just wish the price would come down some. Love the heated mat. Shipping was fast. Would like to have a second matt.
3,Ups and downs,"I have had no problems with the heat mat. I followed the instructions and set it on an insulated surface to increase temp them move it to linoleum floor to lower temp. The dome is really thin plastic. I bought a better dome at my local hydroponics store for 6$. It does not come with any growing medium, only a clonex sample."
3,Good package,"Received in a timely manner from seller, good deal. My only complaint is that the plastic is really thin, like the clam-shell containers restaurants use for salads and the instructions are one sheet of paper, very vague, not helpful at all. Cheap."
2,dissappointment,"i have used it for a week and had go buy a new heating mat, had needed it. and the dome side vent missing had to tape one side of it, sad."
3,72-cell seedling inserts?,"Nice high dome and heating mat, my only concern with this product is the description part of it says ""72-cell seedling inserts"" not ""insert"" to me this sounds like the soil medium like peat pots are included?? I guess I was just expecting more because of the one little ""s"" but that s is misleading."
3,hot house with heat mat,I purchased this product to grow ghost peppers but nothing grew. The product seems to be all that was advertised. Maybe something will grow.
2,poor packaging or what ever,One out of the two hydro-farms i received was missing one of the side vents...i believe this was done during packaging....
5,Great Hot House,"This is my first attempt at growing herbs, flowers and plants from seeds. This product was easy to set up and after only three days I had plants starting to grow. The heat mat in combination with the hot house works great together. The only issue I had was not a lot of written instructions."
5,I would buy this again,"I was very pleased with the quality of this product. With the larger dome I can leave it in place longer so the plants get a better start than with the smaller one I used in the past. The dome, tray, and heat mat are all of good quality. The insert for the individual plants is a bit thin. I plant in peat pots or jiffy sevens so the insert is not something I will use anyway."
3,The coco plugs are a mystery?,"I have outgrown the coco plugs, but they seem to crumble when I try to transplant and I have no real idea how to keep the right moisture in them. It was suggested to touch the surface of the coco, and if there was no coco stuck to my finger, it meant the medium was either too wet or too dry. However, I always seem to get some coco stuck to my finger regardeless of how I water, or don't water. The dome is so thin it tears. The concept is excellent and the mat works great. But, I just can't get comfortable with the coco plugs. I'll definitely switch next time."
2,Product wasn't right,"Product said it includes 72 seed starting Coco Plugs. When I got the product, no plugs. Called Amazon and they said the plugs do come with it, so a replacement was sent, but was the same as the first. Called Amazon again and they said the dealer could no longer offer this product, so i found another dealer and got CK64061 that came with the plugs.The product itself works great and really helps increase germination rates, product just could use a more detailed instructions(which has no growing tips)."
1,Terrible Chemical Smell - killed seeds,I bought this hoping to speed up a late start on a few veggies. I planted a dozen different seeds using potting soil in the cell tray. After 24hrs I took off the dome and was just about over whelmed by a strong chemical smell. I left the cover off for a couple of hours and the smell lessened somewhat. I put the dome back on and left it over night. The next day the strong smell was back. So I left the dome off and covered the tray with plastic wrap. Again next day same smell just as strong. I determine that the smell was from the bottom tray. I move the cell tray to an old garden tray and rigged the dome on to it. Two weeks later nothing has germinated and the soil still smells faintly of the chemical. Whatever the chemical vapor was it killed my seeds.
2,Poor Quality,I returned this to Amazon for the poor quality. The plastic vents were warped - they did not seal right and kept popping off. The plastic is just too thin to really be of any quality.
4,Quick starts for seeds,"Worked very well to start a variety of vegetables and flowers. The top is pretty flimsy plastic and while it hasn't broken, I don't feel too confident about longevity."
2,Seed Cooker,I cooked my seeds with this contraption. The heating pad would be infinitely better if it had temperature control. Though all in all I like that all the components were included.
3,It's OK nothing special,"I read the reviews other people wrote and thought well some like it and the complainers don't. Well, I'm not a compainer, but the lid does leak. And, the vents on the end are flimsy and don't fit well. I went on vacation for a week. While I was gone, all the water leaked out and the seedlings all died. I had to replant everything when I returned."
4,Great to start seeds / starters,Works great to get seeds started and roots going; especially along with using the Hydrofarm JSV2 2-Foot Jump Start T5 Grow Light System
3,It would be GREAT if it didn't soak everything,"I've raised two batches of seedlings in this hothouse over the last two weeks. It works as advertised (though I didn't receive the packet of Clonex in mine), but the lid is poorly designed. It will drench your surface if you bump the hot house walking by or when checking on your plants. It's not a tight fit so it doesn't always keep the plants as warm as it should. If you're using loose peat to raise your seedlings it may get down into the reservoir tray and turn funky; just take it outside and wash it down to prevent something gross from growing. The heating mat works great! I've had it plugged in for two weeks straight and it still works even with all the water coming off the hothouse lid. If you want to avoid getting water everywhere, just try and find another lid or use plastic wrap instead. In the end this product's not bad, not good, but considering the price of heating mats and domed hothouses on Prime it's an okay deal."
5,So glad I got this taller one,"My plants grew so, so fast in this container that I am so glad I got this taller one. I had very tall plants in just two weeks. My first experience at starting my own seeds and I am hooked. It was so much fun watching these little babies come out of the dirt and knowing I made them beautiful. I loved the first one so much, I ordered another one. Love them. I purchased this through Amazon, of course. I LOVE to buy from Amazon. Have never, ever been disappointed, and I order a lot of stuff. hahahaha"
3,Heat mat & dome review,"The heat mat works great for seedlings and clones. The roots along with all the soil are kept quite warm as long as you have it plugged in. The clear dome is heavy duty plastic and will work for years to come. The one problem with the clear dome though, is the fact that the vent covers arent connected at all on the sides. They continuously fall off and I end up looking around for a tiny little cover. The top vent is fine, the side vents were cheaply made to just slip inside a little hole without any sort of anchor. Sloppy engineering.(cheaper to make, more profit, i get it) Overall - decent, not the best though"
5,Works well,"I bought this after failing to make a make-shift green house grow anything. I planted a few seeds and just a few days, they started to sprout. I did buy the hydro farm themomitor cause it seems the heat pad heats too much. But after buying that, it seems to work great."
3,Good Documentary,This Documentary was good because they focus on his career more than his trouble life. That being said I would rate this Documentary of a grade C+ because I believe they should focus equally on his life and career to give the audience who watches this documentary a whole understanding of how his life was affected by losing his mother and a father who was distant from him.
5,A Must Read,A thorough and to the point examination of the issue of life after death in relation to Hell and why a Just and loving God would not only create such a place but why there must be a Hell. This book also answers from scripture those who would deny Hell and its reality. It left me more greatful of God's grace as found in Jesus Christ alone and a greater burden for the Lost.
5,ROLA SWING AWAY CARGO CARRIER,"Item received without delay or problems. No damage on any part of any product. Assembled by my self and was able to install all wiring without any problems. Installed a Lic. Plate bracket with a light using an after market product, but using the system offered by company would have made life a little easier (all though mine works great the way I installed). No water got inside of carrier while traveling over 3000 miles-went through many rains while sitting and traveling. Many other travelers were very impressed with this unit and how we were able to raise our 4 Runner's tailgate. 100% recommend. I almost bought a different product-very glad I didn't.Rola 59109 Adventure System with Swing Away"
3,Looks good on my Sprinter van,"Came with wrong fasteners; locking nuts did not fit bolts, not the same thread. I had to go to hardware store to get matching locking nuts after struggle to install first one. Top doesn't fit we'll on one side. Flimsy locking mechanism,doesen't look real secure.Location for license plate too low on base tray , gets bent up when laying unit flat.Big Roland sticker in middle of box very hard to remove. Completely messed up area when removing glue remnants and had to paint that area. Looks O.K. Now."
4,Wellements Protien,"Good product, but the service was even better. I highly recomend this seller and the product also. The protien powder really doesn't have a lot of taste though. Good quality though"
4,Good stuff,"I've used this product prior to purchasing from Amazon. Blends well in the shaker bottle. I've had gastric bypass surgery and this is an excellent product for me to supplement my daily protein requirement. I use the vanilla because I can use it with juice, usually orange juice. If I want chocolate or strawberry flavor, I add sugar free chocolate syrup or strawberry flavored syrup to the product and milk."
3,Doesn't always dissolve well,"I am not going to lie, I'm really picky about my fitness foods. Probably because most of them taste really gross. I was looking for a long time for a protein powder that was not too sweet, and not too chalky. All the chocolate flavored ones are just too sugary in my opinion, so I was happy to find a 'mocha' flavor. This stuff is great. I'm not a big fan of this in just water, I prefer it blended in with greek yogurt & ice. If you mix it into your milk, you have to mix it REALLY good, maybe even in the blender. Both times I've tried to make mine creamier with milk ended up with nasty chunky bits."
3,AA Battery Charger,"I use this charger to recharge AA batteries in my car for hand held GPS units. It works well for charging either 2 or 4 batteries at a time. The batteries supplied with the unit lack any information on their mAh capacity but appear to be something less than 2000 mAh and discharge in use in a handheld GPS after a few hours. I typically use 2300 mAh batteries with this charger to get a longer period of use. So: good charger, so-so batteries."
4,Excellent Receiver for this price,"I got this thing last week, and at one eighty-four shipped; that is tough to beat. It was two forty nine retail in store or higher (plus tax). Not too keen on the remote .... kind of weak and not intuitive (lots of buttons, not too much funtionality ..... took me a while to figure out how to go to a station directly without using presets or seek). Also, just one other question that still puzzles me. How is this rated 7.1 if it is 6 X 90W???? Not too sure about that, but it is still a very good receiver at a great price. I had no problems setting up (probably because I didn't use the manual). More connections than I could ever possibly use ..... how much equipment do you people have and then why are you bottom dwellers not getting high-end HK and Onkyo components?? :) Pretty happy with the purchase overall."
1,Warning for average buyers,"The setup unstructions for this amplifier are so unclear they are indecipherable. I am not an audiophile, but over many years I have hooked together preamps, turntables. tape decks, DVDs, TVS, with an amplifier, speakers and subwoofers. I have managed fine getting my computers up and running. But this bear of an amplifier has me frustrated and angry. The manual is absolutely the worst set of instructions I have ever read for anything. It is obvious Sony never pretested their manual setup directions on average buyers. I read one warning about this, but was confident I would do ok. Now I regret buying this amp wasting hours getting it right."
4,Sony STR-DE698,"Receiver works well. Manual was difficult to understand and poor instructions(non-existent) for programing the unit for other remote controls. A little underpowered, but seems like a good quality unit for the money."
4,Drum References,"This was a good book for a basic understanding of drums, and it could be used for beginners to the experienced drummer. This book is worth considering for most drummers."
3,Older movie than I expected,It is good for someone new to the consciousness movement but no new information. It is a good movie though.
3,Halo 2 Action figure series 7 heretic Elite,"The figurine is pretty cool looking but not very sturdy. The first day one of the back wings broke after 1 hour of play. From then on, it's been super glue city to keep them on. All have broken and been re-glued. It is definitely not a play toy."
1,Free????????????????????????????,"It's not a movie, just creepy commentary. Well I thought it was a full movie for prime members. Do not bother to order. SKIP IT!"
2,It's just a preview and not the movie.,"I thought it was the full movie, but instead just a long preview. Really didn't get what the movie was about except for it's about army guys. Don't think I'll rush to rent this movie. Looks boring to me."
2,Did not finish,I stared watching this and realized it was a documentary. I did not like. I would not recommend this to anyone.
5,Its A Great Movie,The Movie was great....everything about it the acting the photography and especially the directing ..... its just a great movie
3,IT WAS ONLY A TRAILER,IT WAS ONLY A TRAILER - I DO NOT REMEMBER IS I PAID FOR IT OUR IS WAS A FREE SAMPLE. TOO BAD
2,didnt like,I did not know it was just a clip from the producers. I thought it was actually the movie so I did not care for it.
1,this is not the full movie its a preview,This is not the full movie. thought I would be able to download it to the kindle fire and watch it on the plane and no such luck. its a preview.
1,What a horrible movie.,"This movie was horrible. awful scripts, bad acting, bad story. I hate this movie with a passion. Don't go see it."
5,Love it!,This was so nice and the price was so great I ended up getting two more! I would highly recommend these if anyone asked me.
5,Crazy Low Price | Great Product,"I love this case. It was crazy cheep, I received the production on time, it's protecting my guitar from all that dust that I usually have to clean off after a week, and I love the pockets in the front that I use to carry my cleaner, extra strings, picks, etc. Thanks!"
2,Just like buying a product in a supermarket,Recipes are just like following instructions from any product you buy in a supermarket. You can't find any innovating stuff.
5,Extremadamente interesante,El libro contiene una información increible sobre el facinante mundo de la interpretación de los caracoles. Es muy complejo para un principiante; pero para el que desea realmente información como practicante de La Religión este libro es invaluable.
1,HARD TO UNDERSTAND,"WILLIAM BASCOM BOOKS IFA DIVINATION & THIS BOOK IS SO HARD TO UNDERSTANDI LIKE OBI DIVINATION & SIMPLE HOW-TOS BOOKS FOR BEGINNERS.THIS BOOK IS FOR YORUBA PREIST WITH MANY YEARS EXPERIENCE KNOWING HOW TO READ VERSES & KNOWLEDGE OF ALL IFA PATHS, VERSES, COMPLICATED YORUBA WORDSA NEW ORISHA/SANTERA LIKE ME COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIS BOOKS"
1,Burning Geoffrey Wolff's Bridges,"This Wolff, unlike his brother, Tobias, is afflicted with the demons of his father. Updike in his review said it all.Geoffrey Wolff knows how to write a good biography, i.e. the one about Harry Crosby, so that he should have kept himself out of this one and have done more research."
2,The Art of Making an Interesting Man Dull,"I haven't read any O'Hara, although I know the name and the names of some of his books ring a bell. I bought this bio on remainder, thinking that if he was as interesting as the flyleaf claims, it should be an interesting read.Not so. Wolff succeeds thoroughly in recounting ""wild"" adventures as if he is presenting evidence in court. I wasn't looking for lurid hyperbole, but couldn't Wolff have made the object of his bio a little interesting? Now I know why it was remaindered at $2.I don't know what the title means, and I don't intend to read the second half to find out. Dull, duller, dullest."
2,ART OF SELF-PROMOTION,"WELL I GIVE THE GUY CREDIT EVEN THOUGH I AGREE WITH THE DISAPPOINTED REVIEWERS AND O'HARA FANS THAT WOLFF CLEARLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HIS SUBJECT NOR BOTHERS TO RESEARCH IT BUT HEY - HE MANAGED TO GET A BOOK PUBLISHED AS BIOGRAPHY BY KNOPF WHICH IS UNEDITED, MISPELLED, SLOPPY AND NOT EVEN SCHOLARLY! GIVE THE GUY CREDIT FOR A GOOD SWINDLE. AS FOR THE PETTY NARRATOR'S OBSESSIONS AND PEDANTIC ASIDES FROM AHIGH ABOUT THE AGONIES OF GREAT AUTHORSHIP (GEOFFREY WOLFF IS A CREATIVE WRITING TEACHER BY TRADE) THEY GET OLD: WHY SHOULD THIS MAN PRESUME TO KNOW AND LECTURE ABOUT WHAT O'HARA FELT? ITS LIKE A STRUGGLING HILTON LOBBY PIANIST LECTURING ON HOW PAINFUL MUSIC WAS FOR SINATRA AND GERSHWIN (AND OH, HIM TOO)... JUST BECUASE IT IS TOUGH FOR WOLFF, WAS WRITING TOUGH FOR O'HARA? HARD TO SAY. APPARENTLY WOLFF'S BOOK TOOK HIM A DECADE TO GET OUT BUT FOR THE PROLIFIC AND BLOCKBUSTING TALENT OF O'HARA WAS IT THAT BAD? ONE DOUBTS IT OR ELSE HE WOULD HAVE DONE LESS OF IT."
5,"A real, gritty and poignant panorama of life in Paris","Miller, in his masterful way, gives us an account of Paris like it was...and is. Far from our clichés of a saccharine city as portrayed in fairy tales like ""Amelie"", ""Quiet Days at Clichy"" mingles the picturesque with the down-and-out for a portrait that would have pleased Emile Zola. Whores and cafes, venereal disease and breakfasts of Roquefort and white wine, poetry and squalid prose, Miller dissects Paris in the brilliant way Roman Payne writes about Paris in the novel Crepuscule, the way Zola writes in Therese Raquin... presenting a city that is a filthy beast deserving not less than all our love and praise."
1,Beware-Not formatted properly for kindle iPhone,"I purchased this book for the new Kindle for iPhone app and the book is not formatted properly. There are an endless amount of pages that only have one sentence, sometimes only one word! To read this book you have to flip through a huge amount of pages. Great book, and yes, it was only .80 cents but still... pretty much useless."
4,Fun Read,"I thought this was a fun book to read. As Dorfman goes back and forth between doctors and charlatans looking for a cure to his unknown ailment, he enlightens us about his past and his childhood, which of course, involves his somewhat strange parents. John Blumenthal has written a hilarious novel with a refreshing originality. I pictured the protaganist as a Martin Short type character that he had played in the movie 'Inner Space'.One complaint I have is the quality of the publishers binding. The book was starting to fall apart when I started reading it and I had to treat it with great care to finish it. Not to worry. With the quality of writing that John Blumenthal is coming out with, I see a bigger and better publisher waiting in the wings.Highly recommended for fun and laughs. You might just see a bit of your own self."
4,Hilarious and Entertaining!,"""What's Wrong with Dorfman?"" explores the issues full-time screenwriter and hypochondriac Martin Dorfman faces as he encounters his past and his neurosis. Will Dorfman's script ever make it through the Hollywood runaround and onto the big screen? Perhaps, that is, IF he can put his imaginary illnesses aside for five minutes. While, at times, Blumenthal's characters give you a neurosis of your very own from their constant worry, ""What's Wrong with Dorfman?"" is a hilarious and entertaining read. Blumenthal's writing is witty and fresh and his characters are enthralling. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
3,Dorfman is a decent enough chap...,"This is an appealing lite novel. Dorfman is a sad sack of a guy at times, but you never want him to be unhappy. It is interesting look at how our parents influence us, how society pressures us, etc. The end is a little pat and the characters a little thin. It is funny and a bit sweet. Not a great book, but certainly fun to read."
1,AWFUL !!,"Single camcorder recording; one angle, unintelligible air mic sound all along the dvd. These fellas are HUGE but this is one DVD to keep away from. So typical Cherry Red. I rest my case."
5,Excellent educational resource!,"If you are having trouble getting your child interested in history, this is a video for you! With an upbeat host, fun sketches and exciting visual aids, this DVD can really help excite a young mind. It makes history so fun, kids won't even realize that they're learning. I can see this being useful for both individual parents as well as teachers."
3,Slim pickins,Bought this for some extra student support in our 4th grade California Missions unit. Very expensive. I showed it to the class; I did not find it very engaging or informative. I shared it with colleagues who showed it to their classes; they felt it was not an effective use of instructional time. IMAGINE my surprise when the student asked to re-watch it during a rainy-day lunch period!! Apparently the filmmakers seem to know their audience. I've increased my stars from 2 to 3.
4,Definitely some good tools,"While I became a little frustrated with the large, first section of the book describing the neaderthal brain and how it compares to a toddler's development, it laid the groundwork for what was to come in Part II. Yes, initially I felt very silly using his Toddlerese (basically you talk like a caveman, using short, repetitive words and phrases), but it actually has worked in most instances. I also really like his thoughtful suggestions for discipline, such as ignoring them briefly when they are acting up (BEST PUNISHMENT EVER - my daughter hates this).All in all, I feel better equipped to raise my toddler as she heads into the Terrible 2s. I'm glad I read it."
5,Help! I've Got Twins & I Can't Get Up,"As a mother of four, including twins, I've read all the parenting books. This is one of the most practical, organized, well-written, up to date and pro-active. Much of the time we're REACTING to our kids, instead of acting, and that's what makes this book work. Also, it gives them credit for how smart they are. My favorite recent parenting book is ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,"" by Bruce Stockler, a hilarious, brutally honest, rip-roaring ride into parenthood (and marriage!), told from the besieged Dad's point of view. Unforgettable, wise and heart-warming."
3,Limited value,"The principles behind communicating with your toddler, such as communicating in a way that your toddler understands and showing empathy and acknowledging his feelings are valid. I, however am uncomfortable with the idea of emulating the toddler's undesirable behavior in any way and believe that parents should always strive to model the desirable behavior for the child."
2,Not terribly impressed,"I loved Dr. Karp's ""Happiest Baby on the Block"", so I borrowed ""Happiest Toddler"" from the library. Thankfully I didn't purchase it; I was not very pleased with his methods. Obviously they work for some people judging by other reviews, but my children do not respond to this type of tactic. I prefer to display the kind of behavior I expect from them, and they learn to emulate me. I don't want to throw myself on the floor in a pseudo-tantrum and give them the impression that that sort of behavior is acceptable. I did glean a few good tips from this book, but all in all I was glad to see it go back to the library."
1,Preposterous,"I tried reading this book and using the Fast Food Technique repeatedly with my high energy, very active 2 year old. In addition to making no impact whatsoever on his behavior, I felt like a complete fool speaking to him as a ""little caveman."" In short, this book is asinine and will make you look stupid.Also, the first half is extremely repetitive as other reviewers have mentioned. I don't think it even deserves the 1 star I've given it."
1,Book does not get to the point,Book does not get to the point. Book goes on and on about useless stuff.
4,Pretty Good,I have not read this whole book but what I have read is pretty good. My problem is I am not much of a book reader.
3,Condition of the book,"Although stated in ""very good"" condition, the state of the book, when received, was in a very tatty condition - corners of the pages folded; corners of the book cover started to fray and the covers of the book look very worn."
2,Silly Concept,"Kind of silly concept, we like the playful parenting style better than the ""neanderthal"" method."
2,Disappointed,"Having really enjoyed Happiest Baby on the Block, I thought this book would be helpful too. I was so turned off by it, I couldn't even finish reading. Dr. Karp is pushing evolution in explaining why toddlers behave the way the do. I just couldn't take it anymore."
2,I recycled my copy,"I bought this book thinking that I had heard good things about it, but I must have been mistaken.I found ""Happiest Toddler"" to be badly written, and that's just the beginning. The only reference made to other parenting literature or research was to his own previous book. That's sketchy.My problems with the material presented range from mild irritation with the idea that kids should have their tantrums mirrored back at them to full on nausea at the suggestion that if a toddler has a tantrum in a store it's a good idea to lock them in the car until they calm down.A few helpfull ideas, like using ""magic"" to help young kids with their fears, do not a usefull parenting book make. I was disheartend to learn that this book is a national best seller."
3,"Interesting ideas, but not a manual on discipline","My wife and I bought this book hoping to learn some disciplinary techniques that we could use with our 20 month old son. Although it was interesting to read about the similarities between evolutionary man and toddlers, this book only contains one strategy for dealing with temper tantrums. (Basically, you mirror the child's emotional state and verbalize what you think he is feeling in simple one-to-two word sentences.) It does not contain any useful advice for dealing with provacative behavior that is meant to test limits. It only addresses how you can handle your child when he melts down because he's not getting his way. So, if you are looking for a book that will help your child learn to regulate his own behavior, this is not the one."
1,Crazy,"I am going to be very opinionated here, but just to make the point to you of what it is like. I could not stand this book. I thought the ideas were LOONEY! They recomend that when you child has a tantrum, you join them to help them understand that you understand, even in front of others. Ha! No thanks. I do love my kids, but I also would like them to learn what is correct behavior in front of others. They do have to grow up eventually!"
5,no regrets,"I bought this book because the first book, ""The happiest baby on the block"" was a lifesaver for me when my youngest was a baby 3 years ago. He is now 3 and while I bought the book a little late so all of the information does not apply to me, there is some very helpful things in the book, and suggestions that you can start using right away."
5,Happiest Parents on the Block,"Dr Karp's book guides the reader through general to specific routines and activities for a toddler ages one to four. He is so clear with directions and examples that it is easy to apply to personal situations.I believe this book has been an important foundation for our parenting techniques within our own home. Our toddler is developing into a happy, confident, and affectionate child who seems secure with her changing place in the world. Thank-you Dr Karp for sharing your expertise!!"
1,Terrible book,"Here is the book, in summary:Your child acts like a caveman and pretty much is a cave man in every way. You act like a cave man too so that he understands you and he is happy.Read the above paragraph 500 times. The end."
3,so-so,"It wasn't the wonderful, magical cure that I had heard about. My toddler was no happier with me acting like a ""cave man"" than she was with me acting like myself. It is informative and give you some good info on reflecting feelings back to children, but overall, there isn't much there that most of us do not already know."
2,Didn't have success with this technique,"Although there are some good common sense recommendations on how to connect with your toddler in this book, I found ""Toddlerese"" to be ineffective. In fact, after several attempts I found it agitated my 19 month old (who is generally a pretty ""easy"" kid) even more when she was upset. I think the Baby Whisperer for Toddlers presents more effective methods built on respect for your child and your role as parent. At the end of the day I still find that making eye contact with my daughter and calmly acknowledging her needs is the most successful way to communicate and calm a tantrum. We've also had a lot of success with simple sign language, which allows my daughter to tell us what she wants - she has a strong vocabulary - but we continue to use sign language successfully. My recommendation is to skip this book and stick with the Baby Whisperer."
1,Christians beware...,If this book has helpful parenting advice I was unable to get to it. I couldn't get past the first chapter which gives a very detailed 'historic' account of the evolution of man from fish with gills through thought processing human and compares the gestational period from conception through age 4 as a mirror image of mans million year evolutionary process. As a creation beliving Christian I cannot stomach such 'factual' writing where evolution is concerned and had to put the book down. I was very disappointed because it seemed that it might have made some good points otherwise.
4,great book,So far im lovig this book! I'm not over reading it but definetely helps you to understand your child....great buy!
1,The talk infuriated my toddler,"This book simply didn't work for us. Many times my 2 year old son would throw a tantrum because he didn't know what he wanted. Example: ""I want juice Mama"" I give him the juice. He falls out on the floor crying. ""I don't want juice anymore."" I take juice and put it on the table. ""I want juice Mama."" AAAAHHHH! I couldn't ""caveman talk"" because neither my child nor myself knew what he wanted. The other parts of the book were to shallow. I really liked John Rosemond's making the terrible twos terrific."
2,Kinda So-So,"I agree with those who said that Happiest Baby on the Block was so extremely helpful, and this one only mediocre at best. For us, anyway. After stopping a few pages into this book, I have tried to read more of it on several occasions but haven't managed to stick with it for very long. I guess we were already doing ""toddler-speak"" on our own, so it doesn't seem like a revelation to us. With Happiest Baby I thought it was all the precise details of his explanations that were so helpful. For what I've read of his Toddler book, it didn't really expand on the basic idea already presented in a basic synopsis or even many reviews of this book. If you get the idea from the description of this book, you may already be done with it."
1,"Sorry, I'm not a cave dweller!","This book was REALLY not for me. The whole premise is that toddlers are like little Neanderthals, and you have to speak/relate to them accordingly (e.g. barking, ""ANGRY...you want OUTSIDE...OUTSIDE...OUTSIDE, NOW!!"" at your tantruming toddler who wants to go out to play). As if that isn't strange enough, the author takes things even farther, suggesting that parents actually furrow their eyebrows, bare their teeth and GROWL at children when they misbehave. The whole thing was just way too far-fetched for me. I honestly started to question the author's grasp on sanity. Apparently these methods work for some families, but if you're like me and the idea of barking and growling at your baby turns you off, you might want to look elsewhere for a parenting guide."
5,Absolutely Great!,"I belong to a book exchange and exchanged this book for ""The Child Whisperer"" which I personally feel is one of the best and simplest parenting books around. Like ""The Child Whisperer"", ""The Happiest Child on the Block"" skips the high brow theory and gets right into practical application of sound and proven techniques. If you are looking for a no-nonsense approach to improving your relationship with your toddler, buy this book. Oh, buy ""The Child Whisperer"" too and you will have two great books for your resource shelf or to exchange with others."
1,Toddlers as Cavemen?,"This books represents a disappointing trend in parenting. Comparing Toddlers to ""Cavemen with undeveloped brains"" is disrespectful and unneccesary. I disagree with his basic tenant of talking down to Toddlers, or using his 'toddlerese' to talk with children. Parents need to continue to model socially appropriate behavior, not imitate their children's tantrums. Check out anything by Magda Gerber, or ""1,2,3, The Toddler Years"", by Irene Van der Zande, for a respectful and effective method of helping children with their big feelings."
2,not the baby book...,I loved Karp's baby book! Could not have made it through the first few months w/out it. Do NOT like this one though. I recommend 123 Magic 2-12yr old.
1,Very disappointing.,"I was so excited about the title of this book but I was terribly disappointed once I began reading. I really could not get past the repeated references to monkey-cave-whatever children. I know I am raising a human being! My child is not ""evolving."" She is growing and learning. I took this right back to the store.Better books to read: ""Positive Discipline in the First Years"", ""The First Three Years of Life"", and ""Raising a Happy, Unspoiled Child."""
1,Pop ethnopediatrics are useless,"This book was a silly mess. Karp's pop ethnopediatric approach, which likens toddler development to the evolutionary development of humans, was silly at best and scientifically shoddy at worst. In addition to the problems with his guiding analogy, his notion of ""speaking toddlerese"" and thus supposedly showing our young children that we understand their feelings is ridiculous. Maybe it's just my kid, but I don't think many young children are that in touch with the feelings which we are supposed to mirror back to them. In addition, my child doesn't care if I understand her or not if (as another reviewer remarked) the answer is still no. I think understanding child development is very important in helping parents to contextualize and deal with various behaviors, but this book is a failure in both of these respects."
2,Not what I expected,"Although there were some good ideas in this book, I found comparing a child to a 'neanderthal'and all the prehistoric parenting talk (as if we are training chimps) a bit disconcerting. I also didn't care for suggestions to use 'magic words, magic or invisible protective suits, magic water, secret super spray, talismans, etc""., as a means of calming bedtime fears. The author tells us to 'growl' at our prehistoric toddlers to show them we mean business. He even suggests learning to growl convincingly by practicing in the mirror. Neither we or our children are animals. We are people, made in the image of God. We don't need pagan rituals (offering cookies to the smoke detector alluded to in the book), magic of any type, or animal training techniques to raise our children. I find much of this book ludicrous to say the least."
2,Fishy,"Although I loved ""Happiest Baby On The Block"" I've yet to have similar success with this book and maybe I've just realized why; the central thesis of this book is that ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"" - that, like a growing organism, your baby passes through various stages matching the evolution of our biological ancestors.Here's the thing. I just found out that ""recapitulation theory"" has been discredited (check Wikipedia, for example) - organisms do not in fact pass through various stages matching the evolution of their biological ancestors. Therefore the whole foundation of this book is a flawed metaphor. And although it seems to work for some parents it's possible that's just some kind of placebo effect or self-fulfilling prophecy."
2,Don't waste your money,"I thought raising your toddler meant modeling desired adult behavior. This book teaches you to model toddler behavior by whining back with your child. I wonder at what point you are supposed to stop whining with your toddler when he or she does? 1st grade, 2nd or maybe highschool? Get real.."
1,overboard on the caveman theory,"Im sorry but if i had known that this entire book focused NOT on developmental aspects of a child, but rather how my child is like a monkey or cave person then i would have not gotten it. The entire book practically focuses on that point. Not sure if the author is just trying to be funny; which he wasnt, but it takes away from the whole point of the book. If you are looking for a book that helps you to identify your HUMAN child's personality traits, developmental milestones and how to understand/nurture them, then this is not the book for you. If I wanted a book that just displayed the author's opinions on human development then that is what I would have looked for."
3,Great concept but could have been reduced to a booklet,"Let me first say that I'm a big fan of Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block book. He had a theory (recreating the womb) and explained several ways to carry it out.In this book, he has a theory that your child needs to feel understood and you should let them know you understand them by repeating back to them what they just told you, then empathizing. In their words, at their level. (""The Fast Food Rule"") That's ALL. The book is full of examples and uses a caveman analogy to get its point across, but basically the message reiterated is the same or a variation on the Fast Food Rule. The video that accompanies this book is only 37 minutes long!The ""Happiest Baby, INC."" trademark on the back says it all, I suppose. The main goal here seems to have been to turn out a sequel and fluff it up as much as possible to generate maximum profit."
5,Very useful,"I can't think of much more to add to what other positive reviewers have said. The ""fast food rule"" is working out nicely on my 15 month-old. I loved Happiest Baby on the Block also and have recommended it to all of my friends. Dr. Karp definitely has a good understanding of child psychology."
1,Pointless,I found this book to be useless for us. Complete waste of money. Not at all what I expected. If your toddler has daily all out 20 minute kicking and screaming tantrums this method could be helpful. If not don't waste your money. Also it is very drawn out...the whole method could be explained in less than 10 pages.
3,"Good Insight, book was longer than it needed to be","The actual substance of the book was useful, though Harvey Karp's writting style is quite redundant."
1,Wacko.,"The concepts presented in this book are wacko. Recapitulation theory is bunk (just do a google search for ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,"" the book's main tenent, and you will see), and the book is completely based on this baseless theory.Speaking to your toddler in short phrases that s/he can understand? That should be a no brainer. Why this is a revelation to people I cannot understand. Speaking to your toddler as if you are a caveman? That is crazy. I refuse to act like a primitive version of a human in the grocery store instead of modeling appropriate behavior for my child.Any book will have nuggets of wisdom. This one has very few, and ferreting them out is not worth your time, money, or attention."
2,Stick to the Plot,"I thought that the core story was good. However, for my taste, there was too much descriptive. I didn't feel I needed to know where he ate, what he ate, what street he turned down or how the town or city was years before. I think descriptive is fine but it doesn't have to go on for pages. I found myself reading this book more slowly than normal, since I wasn't too thrilled with the particular descriptive part of the story. I did enjoy the story line, however, just too much narrative."
5,Great Read!,"Fast paced, good mystery/suspense thread, plus just the right amount of romance makes this book one I would recommend to anyone who loves a good whodunit."
4,Arid Read Whets your appetite for more...,"David Mapstone is a history professor, acting as a deputy sheriff. Or is he a Deputy sheriff acting as a history professor? His old college sweetheart asks him to find her sister. He is working for the Sheriff's department to find the solution to a 40 year old crime. In the dark heat of the night, the two searches merge into a search for David's self. How is personal history measured?This mystery novel is about questions... unasked, unanswerable and unwritten.Or it could be just a good story with a great character and good sense of place. Keep writing, John!!"
4,Entertaining,"Entertaining characters, twists & turns and adventures. I saw much sooner then he did what was actually happening--he was being really dumb about the people and what they were doing."
1,...........,"Lame, anyone who buys this is clearly an idiot. Nigg* over and over and over to annoying craptastic beats.....rap sucks."
3,Good but could be better,"Government regulation of business is always a topic of controversy, but few people know anything about its origins. This book provides a history of the origins of government regulation in the US, by specifically focusing on four important individuals and how they shaped US regulations. Though they are important, their influence was primarily through the executive and judicial branches of the federal government. The book should have included a great legislator along with the four individuals it focused on.The book is tedious and dry, but not difficult to read. The topic matter is well explained with lots of references, but a lot of text could (and should) have been replaced with charts, graphs, flowcharts, and timelines. I would not recommend this book as an introductory text to government regulations, but more for the well-read observer."
1,What was sent was not what is pictured,"I ordered this as it appeas to have an angled heating element, as does the one offered by Big Green Egg. The starter they sent was not angled, but straight like a 'typical' charcoal starter. ANTONLINE refused to anser my emails so I resorted to Amazon for a refund."
3,Electric Charcoal Starter,The online picture makes the product look like the larger kettle style starter. That is why I ordered three of them. It actually is the smaller straight version. We will use them anyway as they do not last long if you do a lot of BBQ. The company was very efficient and quick to ship.
3,"Good ""B"" Movie","This movie is a romantic comedy, and also resembles a sci-fi story. Specifically, one of the main characters is telepathic. The movie is mostly clever and interesting, but is also occasionally a bit silly and predictable. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. Though the movie is only available on VHS tape (as of 1/09) it is certainly better than a lot of other movies that are available on DVD."
4,Just Hold My Hand...,"Skyscraping finds Martin Fry (almost) on his own, since this is really simply a solo album with help from his friends. Glenn Gregory from Heaven 17 e.g. lends a hand giving the sound often a lush feeling. On too many tracks Martin seems to be trying too hard to give the sound some edge. It is the more relaxed efforts that shine and shine they do in epic proportions. Stranger Things is as catchy a pop tune as they come, yet could be classified as easy listening. The title track, however, is the album's gem. One can listen to it again and again without getting tired of it. With enough marketing ammunition this track could easily become a huge hit appealing to a wide spectrum. Really, the album is worth purchasing for that single song. There are other good songs on the album, but programming the CD is still a must."
4,Good Stuff,"Not as great as others discs by ABC, but still very enjoyable, especially the track ""Stranger Things""."
2,A big disappointment,"Having been one of only about eight people on the entire planet to own all of the ABC albums and willingly admit to doing so, I really looked forward to the release of a new ABC album - particularly since their last album, Abracadabra, was easily their best.Unfortunately, with Mark White out of the picture, ABC falls flat. Even the best moment on the album, ""Stranger things"", sounds stilted and artificial, the equivalent of trying to bake a cake based solely on a picture of one. Sure, Messrs. Fry and Gregory toss in a few recognizable motifs from ABC past, but this just adds insult upon injury.Save your money. Buy the remastered editions of the first four albums instead."
3,"Life, love, hope and tragedy...","Tharyn and Dane continue to be an inspiration to all. Life in the west will challenge them in unexpected ways. Enjoyable characters, but overshadowed by unending bibical quotes."
2,Nothing New Under The Sun,"I don't understand the other reviews but in all honesty, this story was written very boringly. The message on jackleg preachers is clear and has been told by several other authors, but in a more upbeat and realistic fashion. I would suggest the Reverend Curtis Black trilogy series by Kimberly Lawson Roby instead. Also, I've come to find out that even though members of a church know about their pastor's downfall or thorn in his flesh (sexual abuse, sexual perversion, etc.), they accept it and turn their heads. Now this is what needs to be exposed. Someone needs to write a novel about this because this has yet to be written."
4,"When worldy desire seeps into Gods house, faith is stretched.","The Amen Sisters a novel by Angela Benson is a wonderful story of faith, betrayal, and trust. Benson leads you through the lives of two sisters set in the south among a heartwarming collection of Christian family and friends. Francine Amen is apprehensive about going home again after her best friends' suicide. She feels responsible for it, and can't shake the guilt as she faces the grieving family. Dawn Amen-Ray brings her sister into her home after the ordeal, but she has a secret she doesn't want her sister - or anyone else - to find out! This book also boldly confronts the abuse of power by some who are in leadership roles in the Church. It challenges us all to open our eyes as Christians, and confront such issues, both in church and our homes, in the steps laid out for us in the Bible."
2,Delonghi 6707E SafeHeat Oil-Filled Radiator--Out gassing,Delonghi 6707E SafeHeat Oil-Filled Radiator. I purchased this heater a few weeks ago. I wasted my money on this one for sure. I live in a small apartment and I tried to use it in our very small living room. The problem is that when it heats up the paint coating on the unit begins to out gas so bad the we can not leave it on. It causes head aches and nausea. Like I said I have had it a few weeks now hoping that this would burn off or stop but it has not. I don't know how this unit could of ever made it on the market. One thing I am sure of if you use it long enough your going to have health problems from it. I consider it very dangerous to be around for any length of time. The out gassing is really bad.
3,Deffective,"It works fine, but the LCD screen is not placed properly, so you can't see the lower part of it, otherwise, everything else is fine. Let's wait till we get our electricity bill."
1,Makes me Sick,"I'm bringing it back. headaches, nausea. Cheap, but what good is it if it makes you sick."
5,The best by the best,This cd is really great. I don't know what else to say. All these tracks are the best songs from the past kmk cds but they're live! Get it.
5,Emailed to me from a radio program director,"An absolute dynamite emotion filled blues CD. True Texas with a groove. -- Bob Fonda, program director, KLFX"
1,As bad as it gets.,"I purchased this product from a local Lowes retailer. After opening, I found the white (not clear) liquid to be the consistency of butter milk. Large clumps of matter as though it had been frozen. Wanting to get the job over with, I proceded to pour it in a pump up garden sprayer which it immediately plugged up. After two hours and numerous cleanings, I finally managed to dispense the five gallons onto my deck. When the product dried, I was left with white rings that looked like rain drops. Eventhough the problem may be the fault of the retailer, I will never use this stuff again. I complained to Thompson's who offered me another five gallons for free. No Thanks!!"
4,claws is great,"The book claws by will weaver is a great book with lots of unexpected twists and turns like him meeting a ""punk chick that seems to know everything about me and my family"". Jed is a 16 year old kid who is falling into a downward spiral going deeper and deeper destroying his life. Like something they find in his locker that is a big drop but almost everything else that happens is so much worse."
5,Jed's Claws,"This book was excellent. It was about a guy named Jed. His life was perfect. He had a girlfrend, a killer car, a perfect family... What more could a guy ask for? But then he gets this note from someone and his life tumbles downstairs. At first he doesn't believe it but when he gets proof that his dad was having an affair, it messed up everything. He meets this person who gave him the note and he ends up falling in love with her. I was guessing about the ending all the way through the book and I STILL didn't find out the right ending. This book was really addicting and it shows you how even ""perfect"" people's lives can be ruined. When I first picked it up, I thought it would just be okay. When I put it down after I finished it, I thought it was brilliant."
5,Claws,"Very good book that when I first read it I started at 10 p.m. and stayed up till 3 a.m. just to finish it. I really wish it had a different ending, but I wasn't the one who wrote it so it was their choice how they would end it. But I love this book very much and Will is a very good writer"
5,EXCELLENT!,"I have to say, when i started reading this book, i wasn't convinced that it would be good. However, after a few pages i was hooked! Beginning simply as a story about a seemingly perfect father having an affair, it turns into so much more, as the story evolves into a romance between the son and the ""other woman's"" daughter. I would love to say more, however, it's soooo much better if the ending is a surprise! Lets just say this, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and then you'll cry some more! All in all, this is an excellent book, and i would definitely suggest it!"
3,what happened to the end?,I thought claws was a really good book. It kept my intrest and was very exciting. the only thing that i didnt like was the ending. i felt that it had no relation to the rest of the book and was just a quick way to stop the story.
4,Great Condition,"Well priced, in very good condition, would have even said ""like new"" as opposed to ""very good""Decent shipping cost and fast arrival. No complaints whatsoever."
4,Absolutely LOVE!,"James Cutler's work is wonderful. His concern for the environment and commitment to not distrubing the buildings surroundings is amazing. The book contains great pictures, distinctly showing his use of wood and jointery. It contains a few drawings on each building, some being rather small and sometimes smudged. Despite this, the book is one of my favorites mainly because of the pictures of such wonderful architecture. If only we could all have such clients (and budget) to work with!"
3,Reads like an Annual Report,"Architects, like engineers, once they venture beyond technical matters, often don't know what to say. (I guess if you spend all your time reading music, you forget how to improvise.) But they are often called upon, unlike engineers, to justify their work. The result here is, sadly, not worth reading. That said, he has good taste. His houses use stone and wood almost exclusively, and are invariably set in beautiful locations."
5,A Must for the Polymer Clay Artist Library,"Sue Haeser's new collection of polymer clay techniques will become a standard in the field. The book is complete, up-to-date and very clear. The graphics and directions are excellent. The examples of leading artists are inspiring. Polymer clay artists of all levels will profit from this publication."
5,One of my TOP 5 books !,"A must have - from beginner to serious polymer clayers, I love to just sit and flip through the pages and find something that SPARKS that next project. I have bought hundreds of books over the last 12 years of crafting and as many serious crafters, you know when you find THAT one book that if you wear it out, you WILL replace it !"
4,Good book for beginner,"I would definitely recommend this book for a beginner, as I am. It gave good information on tools and techniques."
5,Love it!,"Got this book looking for something to teach me basics and how to's for what seem to be more difficult creations. This is it! I just wish I had opened my package before proceeding with a failed attempt at making faux turquoise. Oh well I know now! Great pictures and directions seem easy enough. The only project I question is making cane faces. Seems like there could be more direction but honestly haven't tried it yet.Love it, highly recommend."
3,Good overview of what can be done with Polymer clay,"This book is an excellent overview of what can be done with polymer clay. It has lots of ideas and shows a few techniques from the 5000 ft. level. It was my ""gateway"" into polymer clay. As my interests with clay evolve, I have invested in books that are more specific to my interest (it's a very versatile material) but this is an excellent starter book."
4,The polymer Clay Techniques Book,I am a beginner with polymer clay and I found this book very informative and helpful on some of the many aspects of useing polymer clay.
5,Entomology and the Law,"An excellent reference and a must have for forensic entomology. A good read. Includes a technical, species-level diagnostic key to the eggs, larvae, and adults of those flies common to the dead body party."
5,Forensic Entomology made understandable!,"This is a superb work of immense scope and brilliance. The authors leave no aspect of forensic entomology a mystery. Splendid for experts, both scientists and lawyers alike."
1,Poor quality,"This is also like photocopy of the book, it looks handmade, I was very disappointed! The information in that book is so basic and it looks old.Do not spend your money on this, is not worth it!"
2,not a 'must have',"The photos and illustrations don't look professionally and leave many unanswered questions. The plastic spiral binding and the paper give the book a cheap look. So all in all, it's not worth the price. However, you do get some informations on building puppets."
1,As good as it gets...,"I'm a reader from Mexico and I think The Foam Book isn't worth its price. The reasons: a very unpractical cover that makes it fragile to handle; most of the projects can be made by anybody with common sense without the need of a guide (or at least THIS type of guide); apparently it covers a wide range of puppet parts but the explanations are few or none. It seems like the book was written only for USA or North Carolina residents (Its a pitty).My only advice for you is that, if you are a puppet fan, it would be better to think twice before buying it. If you have the chance,it would be better to consult it at the library."
3,Good book for the competent,"Lots of great ideas, and I think I can probably figure them out, but the authors leave a lot to presumed prior knowledge, and I have never made a puppet. I don't like many of the actual puppets photographed in the book, but that doesn't really matter. I didn't want to copy them in any case. If you're the creative and confident type, this book may give you the boost you need. If you want clear step-by-step instructions, you will be disappointed."
3,puppets,I was hoping to find more detailed and professional looking patterns. The ones given were too sketchy. I am still going to give it a shot but not holding my breath.
3,Great Book,"This is a great book , but as many have said before it lacks patterns to be used or copied. I still had to go online to get my patterns for the heads of my puppet and I was ""on my own"" when it came to body sculpting. but the book did have a lot of useful tips."
5,Life Changer,This book has changed my life. I am not an alcoholic but I used the same concepts in my everyday life. I really recommend this book to any one who wants to live a serene life needs to read this book.
5,A Life Changing Book,"This book taught me how to recognize thought as just that. A thought is not real, but we make it real by believing our thoughts and then getting all emotional about them. Once you become emotional you really believe it's all real. So you can catch the thought and say to yourself, ""Hey that's just a thought and nothing more."" Then you can move on in an instant and enjoy your life. This book can change your whole life."
2,top heavy and does break,"we have used duck tape to keep the top from continuing to fall over, what everyone else says is really true, it does break, i would not purchase it again."
2,It was fine until it stopped working randomly...,I really liked this dryer. But when I went to use it today... it wouldn't blow hot air. it got really hot on the top but no air... I'm returning it and getting my money back... So disappointed... Buyer Beware...
3,Not sure about this product,I saw a lot of good reviews and a lot of not so great ones too befor I bought this product. But this is neither a good or bad one in fact I'm actually not sure how I feel about this product. I love it for the things this type of dryer offers which is not specific to this actual product:1. standing dryer with adjustable height settings2. wheels for easy portabilityAnd there seems to be a lot of air flow but no actual heat. I have tried every setting I can see on the dryer to see if it actually turns the air warm. I just get lots of cool air which eventually drys my hair by the sheer power of it but not quickly enough. Where's the heat? Am I doing something wrong??? Can anyone help me?
1,A lemon,"I was really excited about using this dryer, it was comfortable with plenty of room for large rollers and on low speed the heat was perfect. After 10 minutes it started making a rattle noise and I could smell burning wires and 20 minutes into my drying it went to high and would not go back to low. If I had it to do over I would choose a different dryer, this one does not seem to be reliable. I was instructed to return it to the manufacturer at my expense. I am still working on getting the shipping cost returned from the company I purchased it from, but it doesn't look promising."
4,So far so good!,"I read all the reviews before I purchased and I'm satisfied with my purchase. So far it works good. I did, however, send in my warranty card just to be safe in case I had to have it repaired. The drying time is much faster as it states. It's easy to assemble and store. I rollerset my hair and sat under the dryer for 1 hour instead of my normal 2 hour. It works for me. I'm glad I bought it."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE!,"This product is horrible! I used it for the first time after having it for about a week. I had just washed my hair, I am African-American, so I wrapped my hair to dry, I sat under the dryer on high for about an hour and half and the next thing I know the dryer turns off! I thought that maybe it had some sort of automatic turn off, well it didnt! I was very upset because I was going out that night and my hair was not fully dried! I had to pull out my trusty hand dryer and finish drying my hair. I unplugged the dryer and thought maybe if I gave it a few more days that it would magically reset itself....NOT, well needless to say this product was sent back to the seller after only one use..DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,Good enough,This dryer is adequate at best. The hood is big enough for the largest roller-set but the lid for the face is hard to adjust to a comfortable angle.
3,what did you say????,"My hair grew back after some years of over processing and exercise so I was excited to get a dryer where I did not have to apply ""exact"" heat. Well, it dries very well if you have 2 hours to sit in front of the TV, however, it's EXTREMELY loud. I cannot hear anything that is going on around me.If there were a more quiet version, I'd be all over it but I wouldn't suggest this item if you have an infant or a toddler around as you would not be able to hear them!"
5,Great,Arrived in great condition. Very pleased with the setting options and the quick dry time. I would recommend this product as I am satisfied.
5,So far so good,"[...]First of i would like to say that i have a course hair texture and i have been trying to figure out what works for my hair without having to apply harsh heat tools. This item was given to me on Christmas of 2009 and i have used it on regular occasions but not enough to judge the durability. Other than that it works so well for my curls. It gives me great soft curls that i absolutely adore. I love dome driers and so far this the first one i own and it is still going good. I do recommend it for any hair texture as it is better tan using a blow drier, styling tools or any sort of heat mechanisms."
5,GREAT BUY!,I bought this dryer for my salon. I had a Italian made dryer that cost over $400. This dyer is so much better. The cost is great. It gets very hot and you can move it with ease. Its quite and doesn't take up much room. Great buy...
4,ok for the price,I had to return the first one because the plastic piece that connects the hood to the stand was broken. I don't think this dryer will last long because of this. I would rather pay 50-100.00 more and have it made with metal parts.
5,I LOVE this dryer!,"I bought this dryer to stand behind my chair so that I could get a professional deep treatment or hair drying whenever I needed it. It is SO worth the little bit of extra compared to blow dryers and dryers with bonnet attachments. The only thing that I have to do is plug it in, turn it on, and that's it. I don't have to worry about it tipping over or being the right height (it's height adjustable), getting too hot, or taking too long. With the ionic setting my hair dries very fast--I totally recommend this product!"
3,works quick but loud,This works quickly and my hair looks healthy but it's very loud - it sounds like something is rattling on the inside and its extremely hot!
3,Misrepresented Dryer,"One of the features that made me decide on this dryer is the four heat settings. The dryer is well constructed and quite appealing to the eye, but does not have four heat settings. My hair looks beautiful after drying. I have had plenty of compliments on the the way my hair looks since I started using this dryer but the heat is brutal. There are two heat settings and it's either too hot or too cold. There is no in between. I bought this dryer so as to save time, but surely, this is not a time saver since it takes me about 4 sittings to complete the process.I would have liked to see this dryer with 3 to 4 heat settings or something with a setting such as low as with some heat and not cold, medium and high. Also whenever I use this dryer, almost all of my lights have to be turned off as it interferes with the fusebox meaning everthing else in the house will go out.I can sit under this dryer for ten minutes at a time. Hence the case of the misrepresented dryer."
2,Legs Won't Stay Still,This dryer is great and gets super hot which makes for quick drying time however the mobility of the dryer is NOT AT ALL FUNCTIONAL! The dryer has roller wheels that are detachable so after which falls apart on you so easily. I would not purchase this dryer only for that purpose but if you think you can get around that issue then go for it. Also that little issue is not kid friendly so BEWARE!
4,Perfect birthday present...,"I gave the Hot Tools hair dryer as a birthday present to my mother, she loves it, she used to have the ones that sit on the table now she says she's more comfortable, her back doesn't hurt and it doesn't take the 2 hours it used to take her before to dry her hair. It was easy to put together and the product arrived on time."
4,Nice Upgrade from my old dryer,"I received this for Christmas this year after having this in my Amazon wish list for over a year. So far I am very happy with it. I have used it 3-4 times. It was easy to assemble. I like how it raises up and down instead of my constantly adjusting the hood. When I am under it it seems loud, but when I am standing next to it, it isn't loud at all.I definitely feel like it dries my hair faster and I think it is cutting down on the frizz."
4,Very Good Product,"This hairdryer does exactly what they say. My hair would take 1 1/2 hours to dry sometimes 2 hours depending if I put extra moisturizer on it, since my hair is dry. However this hair dryer does dry my hair in less time then all the other hairdryers I have tried before. I would recommend it."
5,Love it!,"I'm giving this product 5 stars because even though I've only tried it once and had a hard time with the curlers, the product itself was great. I used massive curlers (I think 2 inches?) and have thick curly hair so it was pretty difficult but I still look forward to trying it next time (with smaller rollers!)Hot Tools always impresses me with their products. The adjustable stand is so great too, you can sit at your desk, on your bed and even outside! If you are hesitating don't! Highly worth it :)"
2,"Dryer falls over once in a while, poor design","I bought this dryer for my salon studio because of the excellent price. I rarely use a dryer of this sort as I prefer to use the more gentle thermo-stimulator instead. Anyhow, I am not sure if a piece was missing when I bought it, but I put it together and occasionally it just falls apart at the bottom where the plastic legs snap into the base. I am glad this hasn't hit anyone in the head as the top is quite large. It is poorly weighted and poorly designed in my opinion. I am considering supergluing the entire bottom together, which would make it no longer portable, but could fix the problem."
5,You will love this dryer!!!,"I love this dryer. It works really well, fast and high quality. Just make sure you have a comfy chair and you're set."
4,Great with MindStation add on,This is a great tool. I use it with custom spelling lists that I generate on leapfrog.com and download using Mind Station. The only drawback so far is that it is a little flaky when the batteries wear down though.
5,Turbo Twist Terrific,Bought this for my grandson's birthday (7) cause we were having lots of spelling bees. (Anything to stall bedtime! He loves it!
4,Big Thumbs Up for Turbo Twist Spelling,"My 2nd grade daughter, who is very bright, has had a struggle with spelling because she would get bored with the typical spelling ""drills"" I was using to tutor her. I started looking for something to keep her engaged while teaching her in a positive way. I bought Turbo Twist Spelling three weeks ago and so far it's been fantastic. The proof? Three weeks ago, she got a 10 out of 20 on her spelling test... two weeks ago, 5 out of 20. This week... 20 out of 20, a perfect score! And I give much of the credit to this wonderful learning tool. She looks forward to using it, and I can interact with her with the various games. I can also hear how she's doing by listening to her play with it. Highly recommended!"
4,Worth the hassle,"This toy is a complete pain to set up! .... My problems occured with transfering words to the cartridge. I spent nearly 3 hours trying to get this to work. 1 hour with the service rep, who had no idea how to correct the problems, and 2 hours for myself. The toy does now work with the leaplink, and it was worth every hair that was pulled out of my head! Its a toy to keep my 7 year old's attention, and makes it fun! Just be prepared for some starting troubles!"
3,"A great ""car-ride"" toy","THis does seem to deliver on its educational promise. My daughter, who's just catching on to spelling, seemed enthusiastic and challenged by the various spelling options. It would be a great toy to take along for trips since it's compact and can keep kids occupied while seated. One annoyance is the grating ""voice"" which says things like ""Groovy!"" and ""Dude!"" (don't the toy developers expect girls to play with this?!)"
5,Hope at last !!!!!,"Our Daughter is in the third grade but she is having a hard time.Untill now! Wow ,what a difference it has made. She is no longer in the special reading classes.She is still behind alittle but catching up fast. Praise God ! I give this toy an A+ and 10 stars . We can't wait till we get math and Vocab. Congrat on a great toy. As a mother I recommend this awsome toy."
1,Upset Mom,"This is great product, however, in order to download spelling words you must order a subscription for $30/year. How hard would it be for them to include the software? I was disappointed because I want to use this for many years and think it's a bit ridiculous. I just wanted to warn everyone because this fact was not advertised on the Leap Frog website or any where else when I was researching this. I feel a bit ripped off!:)"
5,"Wow! Children think they're playing, but really......","they're learning! What a great way to increase your child's knowledge. This ""toy"" comes with words already built in, and you can also purchase age specific cartridges to add to the list of words your child can learn.The best part? If you purchase a mind station, you can download your child's weekly spelling tests right into this toy.My son plays with this for 10-15 minutes every night, and has gotten 100% on every weekly spelling test. He's seven and in first grade. I also have two other children, so I have a feeling this toy is going to be well worth my money.How I wish I had something like this when I was younger!"
5,enjoyable toy,I got this toy for my daughter at christmas and she loved it. She plays with it every day and enjoys her time with it. It is really encouraging to know that she will go pick up a toy that helps her to learn versus all the other toys she can play with. She has trouble in spelling and this has helped her especiaaly with the repeat button that she presses over and over again until she can spell the word.
2,Additional Cost Involved,"For those of you who are looking to purchase the Turbo Twist Spelling, Math or other products; please be advised to visit the website at www.leapfrog.com first. The packaging shows that additional downloadable material is available from the website which adds new spelling words and games and gives you the ability to download your child's school spelling list. I was led to believe by the packaging that this was included in your purchase price but it is not. You must purchase this additional information at what I considered to be a high price considering the price of the product itself and the additional equipment that you must purchase to complete the downloads."
1,Not worth the hassle,"It is a major hassle to download the spelling words each week. You have to buy a special interface for the computer, you have to pay to download words, you have to navigate the horribly slow leapfrog site, and you can only download words ""approved"" by the experts at LeapFrog. Every week, between 6 & 30% of my son's spelling list is not on the approved list. Tech support is very uninformed on the product, and although they claim you can e-mail them to have words added to the list, there is never any response or action taken as a result of these e-mails. I am generally pleased with LeapFrog toys, but this one is a huge dud."
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC,"I purchased this TOY (as my son would look at it), to help him with his spelling. He is in the second grade. He loves it and so do I. I download his spelling words each week from the computer and send him off to play. He doesn't even realize that he is studying. He has scored 100% on all his spelling tests thus far. I highly recommend this. Then again, you can't go wrong with any Leapfrog product. I think I own everything they make. My children absolutely love to play with them, and I love that they are learning."
5,GREAT TOOL with Hidden Costs,"I purchased the TurboTwist Spelling for my 8 year of for the purpose of dowloading HER weekly spelling words.I was caugth off guard by the fact that I needed the Mind Station to accomplish what I wished to do. It was only AFTER I received the TurboTwist that I realized I need to buy the other part.The product is outstanding if, as in my case, my daughter is having a tough time catching on to spelling.This has already made learning fun with spelling, fill in the missing letter, and the other ""twists"" it adds to the learning sessions."
4,Great value,"The Turbo Twist Spelling is great value ... Couldn't really fault it and is very simple and intuitive to use - my 5 yo daughter loves it! The only (very minor) point for non USA users is that the letter ""Z"" sounds as ""zee"" and many non-US countries sound ""Z"" as ""zed"". Very pleased with it overall and hope to buy the Mind Station accessory to complement it. REK-OH-MEND-DID!!"
5,Early 80's classic,"If you saw this on VH-1's '80s Band Reunion, it's time to get the real thing. This album is truly a classic of early '80's English pop music. It's refreshingly nostalgic to hear the pure energy and innocence of Haircut 100's mix of sounds. A time capsule? Yes, but in the best sense. Get this album and enjoy."
4,"A great 80's band, smooth rhythms, cool guitar & horns.","Incredible. Just listen to that guitar chucka chucka. Those horns blaring. That spoiled, preppy boy voice. Hey, these guys wore cable knit sweaters and had sun bleached hair parted on the side! This is a wild album, very smooth, kinda funky. Best know for ""Love plus One"", although ""Boy meets Girl"" blows by it with a revved up beat and hyperfast guitar. BONGOS! If you like one song off this album, you'll like the rest. Lucky for you it's available on CD."
1,cheap,You get what you pay for. The straps broke while I was installing the seats. Price & Quality are both Cheap
2,Jeep seat covers,While installing the lines that are used to senched the cover down broke with minor pulling so the seat cover is loose and not real great looking.
4,Assassins of Memory: Essays on the Denial of the Holocaust,Great insights on the truth about the Holocaust
5,A must read for anyone interested in the origins of life,"Unlike most of the books which deal with theories of evolution, this one takes an objective non-partisan approach. The author sticks to the facts and depicts an incredible array of behaviors and facts regarding just about any life form found on earth. This can be sometimes a bit tedious, most of the time very interesting though. I do not think the style is appalling, it is scientific and precise. Chapter 12 (evolution and humanity) could justify the book by itself. I command the author for his amazing and thorough scientific approach, as well as his philosophical insights. In my search for truth and virtue about the humane, i stumbled upon too many one-sided books, and the more thorough i became the more confusing everything grew. I could have just bought this book. For it is also a book about faith, and what it means to be human. Mr Wesson, thank you."
5,Back to Older Industrial,"I got into Ministry during The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste. That will always be my favorite album. They went more and more metal, and then sludge metal. It was not my favorite era of the band. I liked the guitar mixed with heavy industrial beats and sampling, not this much more metalized, barely industrial sound. It took me a while to get the anti-Bush trilogy, which had its moments. This industrial remixed album, though... it's the closest thing to The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste. Awesome industrial remixing!"
3,"Rio Grand Blood brilliant album, the dub for loyal fans only","This album should be purchased by the most loyal of Minitry fans only, unless you are a fan of the more techno mixes of stuff from ministry. This album is a bit hasher for me to stomach. The original Rio Grande Blood is sheer brutality and industrial metal at it's best, and hands down you should purchase it first. As for this album, it's one for the back burner. Still great material, and great polital underpinnings, but just does not do it for me. Not for first time ministry fans"
1,I hate this pan,"I bought this pan 3-4 years ago and have used it maybe three times and I bake on a weekly basis. Every time I use it, I remember why I don't regularly use it. The little cups pop out easily and the pan it awkward to pull out of a hot oven because there's no large surface to grab. You can easily dent your pastry or knock it out of the pan. The cups are also a bit smaller than regular muffin pans, so your size will change and muffin liners don't perfectly shape to it. If you do overfill the cups, the muffin or cupcake top can stick to the silicone and you'll have to break your cake to get it off.Not worth the money or the annoyance of having to wrangle little cups."
2,Out of Date,"This was assigned as a textbook for my Grad class. It was written in 1995 and rather irrelevant to the course today in 2012. I'd have to say, the info was fairly accurate, but looking through the lens of today, I wouldn't recommene it.I think they make some good arguments, but there is better more up to date literature on the subject of schools."
2,"Factual reading, but little else...","I read Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform for a presentation, but I wouldn't have purchased this book on my own initiative. The book is filled with facts and opinion polls, which only reveal the fickleness of the American public -- claiming that public schools are deplorable one year, and excellent the next. The authors inform the reader of what reforms didn't work, but offer few ideas of how to implement change. The book has potential, but falls unfavorably short of expectations."
2,disappointed after reading this book,"Just as someone said below, ""Good book for a report but not for pleasure reading""."
2,Good book for a report but not for pleasure reading,"I am a college student majoring in education and I was required to read this book for a coarse. This book focused on different reforms that were introduced over time and their success or failure. I did not enjoy this book. It was very difficult to read. It mainly consisted of facts and statistics which made it extremely boring. The author could of used more examples and a more familiar language to make the book less challenging to read. This book would be good for someone doing a report on school reform, but not so good for reading from cover to cover."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I thought this product would be better than what it actually was. I thought it would help distort your voice in different ways, not necessarily comical ways like it did. I wish the seller had more information posted about what the product does, and what types of voices it made. If they had better info I could have made a wiser decision."
3,item that doesn't work,"The item was not in working order when received. thinking (hoping) it was the battery we therefore purchased a new battery but again the item did not work.the company has been notified and instructions were given to how best return the item. we will try one more time.one thing about the item itself, there is a need for a very tiny screwdriver to remove the back to get to the battery. stripping the screws was a concern. did not happen but close. getting to the battery also felt cumbersome. the inside appears very fragile. not sure why it never worked."
2,The Boxer,This is a great book. Wonderful photos. All inclusive. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this breed. I just purchased a boxer and I found it informative and very helpful to get a good understanding of the breed. This is a great coffee table book also.
5,Boxer Lovers -- Buy This BOOK!,"As a librarian and longtime Boxer fancier, I can say with no fear of contradiction that this is the best book on the breed published in the last 50 years! It has everything the new owner OR dyed-in-the-wool fancier could want: gorgeous, carefully selected photos from today's premier Boxer photographer, Marcia Adams, as well as numerous other color photos; up to date information on breed genetics and health problems, temperament, and care; a fine history of the breed's beginnings (some photos I've never seen before); and a ""Who's Who"" of present day notable dogs and kennels. The striking format of ""The Boxer, Family Favorite"" makes it an eye catching coffee table display book, too.Run, do not walk, to Amazon to snap up ""The Boxer"" before the first printing is history. :-)"
3,Its ok but not worth the money!,Purchased the Aluminum Tree as it is a reminder of Christmas pasts. My earliest Christmas memory is of the tree that my grandmother had. When I received the tree the middle posts holes were either not drilled properly or the branch just would not stay in the hole. Talk to a person in customer service and they shipped a new one out and received within days. Thanks so much for that. However I do not think that the tree is worth the money. Also purchased the color wheel. No matter where we place the wheel it only lights up a small portion of the tree at a time. My husband is going to try and make a different center post so that the branches stay in the post.Would not recommend purchasing.
3,It's OK,"Trunk is a bit warped and poorly made. Good, reusable packaging. Not quite worth the price but a nice retro look."
4,Nice tree for the money...,"I purchased this tree when it was selling for $99.00 just last year I believe. I now see the tree has significantly gone up in price. In short, I am very pleased with the tree. It's slim and exactly what I hoped it would be. It truly has the original feel like the one I remember from my grandmother's years ago. I purchased a rotating base which I used instead of the base that came with it. Nice tree for the money. Hope it will last for many years to come."
1,WHERE'S THE POM-POM ALUMINUM TREES???,"Ok, when I was little, the most popular aluminum trees were of the pom-pom variety. Why aren't those trees made anymore? If you go on ebay, you will find that the pom-pom aluminum trees command top dollar. But they are all used. Why doesn't a manufacturer remake the pom-poms???? They'd make a fortune, that's for gol-dang sure."
2,Not the Best,Very cheap quality. Had to drill the holes for the branches. The connection of the post is very wobbly therefore making the tree crooked. Over all not a good deal.
4,Retro christmas,Wanted to relive my childhood Christmas and was able to.Just like I remember from the 50-60's.The stand was different but aside from that the assemble and results were the same.
5,Great Repro Tree,"This tree is a great reproduction. You will need to have a drill for the wood pole to make sure the holes are clean and open for the aluminum limbs, but that was a minor inconvenience."
3,This tree could have been worth the cost,I purchased the tree because I have the one from my childhood. The post was spray painted silver and the the paint came off on my hands everytime I touched it. The holes for the limbs must have been drilled before the post was painted because we had to redrill about half of them. With effort this would have been worth the cost but it was sloppily done.
1,missing parts,I would have really enjoyed this very simple and relaxing gift if the kit had been complete. There was no calligraphy paper in the folded box at the bottom of the kit. What a bummer!!
3,A mixed bag,"Some excellent stories, but some that bore. Murguia has the sense of place and delivery of a culture down pat, but needs more skill in weaving a tale. I wanted to like this book more than I did, having read some of his other work, but overall it was pretty forgettable quickly after reading."
5,A Pure Delight,"There were few faces as familiar to television audiences during the 1950's well into the 1960s as that of Arlene Francis. One might dismiss Arlene Francis as a 'mere personality' but oh, what a personality. A personality backed by insightful intelligence, grit and a work ethic that many circa 2011 might find amazing.Arlene Francis: A Memoiropens the gate to the very heart and soul of a woman who was truly a delight. Her memoirs are candid and provide a terrific glimpse into a turbelent era, the transition from radio into television, the years of World War Two.The only criticism, this was but one book, oh if only someone had persuaded Arlene Francis to write more, especially about her brief but amusing movie career.Now one can only hope that more than one season of What's My Line be made available so that one can pay a more extended visit with Arlene Francis and her cast mates."
5,"The 50's and 60's ""It Girl""","I was and still am a huge fan of Miss Francis. She was the first lady of television years ago and continued to shine throughout the 50's and 60's on television and on the Broadway stage. Beautiful, brilliant, witty, sexy and 100% endearing to all who knew her, she had a touch of class and elegance all her own. If you ever had the opportunity to view Miss Francis on ""What's My Line,"" you know the lady to whom I refer. This memoir will give you insight into the creation and grooming of this special personality and a few surprises, as well. She passed away ten years ago at the age of 93. She was the toast of New York City in her day, and lives on in those of us who remember. The memoir is a beautiful tribute to both her professional and personal lives. She once said that ""life was the best party she ever attended,"" and she lived it well..."
4,Arlene Francis Memoir Review. . .,"This is Arlene Francis's personal memoir, written with a ghost-writer in 1978. I don't think it's all-inclusive. There are a numbre of subjects that she barely touches and other subjects that she might have left alone, but I do know more about Ms. Francis now than I did before reading the memoir. Sometimes, it's better not to know too much about someone you like and after reading this book, I feel that way about Ms. Francis. Nevertheless, for a serious fan, it's enjoyable."
4,Swashbuckling and Tears,"Like all of the Sharpe installments, this episode features the adventures of Richard Sharpe. This time, he must take charge of the Royal Irish Guard, a special force more useful as decoration to the Spanish King than as a fighting force. The episode is both action-packed and heartrending as one of Sharpe's long-time riflemen is lost. Sean Bean's mastery of the character is apparent, and fans of the series will not be disappointed."
1,Hmmmm,"As an Alice in Wonderland collector, it was fun to have something new, but it is such nonesense, it will just sit in my collection."
5,Asian-Pacific Folktales and Legends,It is an excelent option for any adult who want to be a child again.
3,"Well, They Tried.","I'm not sorry that I watched this series. I will say that after these last episodes I'm not sorry to see it go and that if I had known it was going to end like this I probably wouldn't have let myself get emotionally invested in the characters. For what it is, the series is enjoyable for almost the entire way through before sputtering at the finish line. If you really want to know how it ends, you can watch the last two episodes but I know they won't be getting much replay value from me."
5,Great Music,This Journey cd was a b-day gift for my sister...she LOVED it!!! So glad to locate on Amazon!! Arrived very fast and packaged perfectly!! Pleased.
5,"My favorite baby product, hands-down","I love my hotslings and always keep one in the car. They don't take much space, they are light and fold nicely. You can even use the; as blankets or as nursing covers. This khaki one is stretchy and really soft. The color goes with everything and my baby loves it. It might take you some time to learn to use it but the DVD that now comes with the sling is very helpful, and so are the instructions on [...]."
4,Ahead of it's Time!,"I always enjoy watching this film. Probably it was ahead of it's time with some of the effects. The one thing I've always wondered was where they filmed the ""HQ"" for the labs. It looks like some type of stadium. Anybody have any clues for that?****UPDATE***I found the answer to the ""HQ"" question. You can find it to at IMDB."
4,BLOODY GOOD TIME!,"When she takes her clothes off, it is apparent to all that Raquel Welch would become a star. The way she unzips is thrilling! I imitate it all the time. The story? Doctors get miniaturized and go into the body of a man to perform inside surgery. They must battle an uncommon array of enemies: leukocytes, T-cells, viruses, etc...all of which attack the submariners with undignified alacrity. Their egress is ingenious, and right in the nik of time. It is hard to believe this film was made in the mid 1960's. The special fx are surprisingly modern - even by ILM standards. The story is strong. And the ""Cold War"" motiff fits quite nicely. What I find most peculiar is the fact that this film is never shown on television. Not even on cable. I wonder what that's about. And don't forget about that body to die for. And those eyes. We don't have many old movies here, but it's one of our favorites."
4,"The film is aging, but it still impresses",This is one of the few science fiction flicks made back in the sixties that still continues to awe its audience. We've made much advance in the area of presenting special effects since this film's release; but it's still got plenty of popularitiy to entertain another generation of sci-fi fans.
4,Great learning tool,"This would be a great movie for a remake. While the special effects are obviously from the 60s, the movie itself fascinates my 4-year-old just as it did when I first saw it. Somebody, please remake this movie with today's special effects!!"
4,Classic!!!,I have seen Voyage from the bottom of the sea when I wad a child (VHS) and it's seen better the colors and everything.
4,Decent Quad Set,I happen to own seven of these Fox quad sets.Most I have purchased for $10 at Target which is a good value for any classic movie fan. Keep 'em coming Fox! Each movie has its own disc (no flippers). The theme on this set seems to be Action/adveture. One of the greatest sci-fi classics is found here in Fantastic Voyage. The special effects are quite remarkable considering there was no CGI then. Having a great cast including screen goddess Racquel Welch doesn't hurt either. The only weak entry in the bunch is The Lost World. The presence of Claude Raines is the only saving grace in this one. Kind of disappointing also is the inclusion of the non anamorphic disc of Towering Inferno. They could have easily used the disc that is part of the Special Edition instead. It is anamorphic which means that it has the proper ratio but fills up more of a widescreen TV.
3,"""Lost World"" is one of the worst movies ever made","Other than ""The Lost World,"" the other movies in this set are OK. The Lost World has horrible production values for being an ""A"" list movie. Here are a few hilarious examples: The expedition goes to an outpost on the Amazon in the dense jungle in the middle of nowhere--and at dinnertime in the evening the actors come out in sport coats and evening wear. The Dinosaurs are real monitor lizards outfitted with prosthetic horns and spines along the back to make them look scary, then they are filmed in slow motion rambling through what looks like a forest of broccoli spears. The ASPCA would have had a cow because the monitor lizard/dinosaurs then proceed to tear each other to shreds. Night scenes are filmed in broad daylight the way old TV westerns were filmed back in the 50's and 60's. I'm sure Mystery Science Theater 3000 did an episode for this movie."
3,Fantastic once it gets going,"You have to suspend your disbelief, of course, before you even get started here. It takes them half an hour just to get to the miniaturizer so they can be shrunk and put into the syringe before they go on their wild and dangerous trip through the human body.The effects are really very good considering when the film was made.It is an entertaining diversion."
3,22nd century technology!,"My favorite thing about this movie is that it's so far ahead of it's time, we still can't even do it today. Heck, we still haven't even figured out how to shrink fat cells. People who love today's big movies will complain that the special effects are out of date (if they even bother to give the movie a chance), and they are, but I enjoyed them. They were so colorful... just beautiful to look at. They also did an excellent job of showing how the inside of the body works. The only reason I cannot give this movie 4 stars is because the plot was just so slow. It was actually hard to pay attention to at times, and that made me sad because it had such a unique premise. Maybe I can plead ignorance... history was always my worst subject... I was born way after the sixties and I have to admit most of those references were way over my head. Once the ""voyage"" was underway, and I could see what was going on, I could enjoy the movie a lot more."
3,Love the movie. . .,". . . even my 7 year old daughter loves it. But this disc has a flaw in it. Not sure if it's a pressing problem that has all the disc having this problem or just mine. At a certain spot in the movie, the disc stops and does not allow the player to function, i.e. can't fast forward, can't rewind can't continue playing. This has happened on two separate players. I don't see any flaws but it's certainly there."
4,Doc never lets you down,I enjow the Doc Savage books. They are a fun easy read with humor and one fantastic escape after another.
4,Super Reader,"The Sargasso Ogre is literally a pirate. Operating in a region that gives him his name. Doc and his crew become embroiled after they find out about a ship that is 'on his list of scalps'.The Ogre himself manages to fight Doc to a standstill, in a man on man hand to hand brawl. Both Doc and Monk run afoul of a group of Amazons, victims etc. of the Ogre and his depradations.The titian-haired Kina la Forge would probably get along well enough with Belit, that is for sure. This character and her band add a little more interest to the book, raising it to rate above average. After disentangling themselves from such feminine hindrances, Doc goes on a one man assault mission.In the end, you wonder if any beasts of the deep enjoy roasted Ogre?3.5 out of 5"
3,Hanna's daughters,"I usually really enjoy this kind of book but i think it must have lost something in the translation as i found the style quite bland. The story on the whole was good, but i much prefered a book called 'Stones from the river' by Ursula Heigi that is like this in some ways -only a lot better. I just felt like it lacked something."
3,My Expectations Were Too High!,"Read this for a book club. Too many characters to follow, some of which I felt had no importance to the story. Had to force myself to read in the hope that it would get better. Enjoyed only about 45% of the book. Was really looking forward to a good read but found myself somewhat disappointed."
4,Generations anchored together,"The captivating story of three generations of women and their families. Culture, current events and circumstance determine their options but the force of each woman's personality and character defines the ultimate shape of their lives. Beautifully written. I'll read it again and will share it with others who love good contemporary fiction."
5,A touching story about a woman's life without being kitsch,"This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for quite a time - I never had time to read, but one nicht I grabbed it and could not stop reading. For a few days and nights I lived with Hanna, Anna, and Johanna - all three of them remarkable women in their times. It is very much a ""women's book"", I cannot picture men liking it that much, because they don't know (and they CAN'T) anything about the sometimes difficult relationships between mothers and daughters. This book even taught me a lesson: talk to each other as long as there is time, don't put it off. It's a wonderful book that makes you laugh and cry! withought being KITSCH."
2,"Fragmented, disjointed POV as well as in its telling","Love generational, historical books that weave families and events. Unfortunately this one reads like a series of unconnected sentences with unrelated facts. I felt that none of the characters were developed to the point that they were real."
4,Three women through hundred years of history,"I had a hard time putting this book down. The chapters on the three different women (mother, daughter and granddaughter) and their history was fascinating. It was very interesting how their roles as women/mothers/wifes developed through their own lives which made me think about the bonds of mothers and daughters in my family."
1,I wonder if it was as depressing to write as it was to read?,"The front of my cover reads ""an uplifting family saga"", but I found nothing uplifting about it. This was one of the most depressing and dull books I've read in a while. Perhaps it has some redeeming value as ""literature"", but an enjoyable read it is not. Hanna, Johanna, and Anna are mothers and daughters who are, simply put, always sad. The idea of happiness is occasionally contemplated, but then decidedly dismissed. I read to the end just to see if anything was ever going to happen. Finally something did. They died."
1,An unfortunate mess.....,"I found this book so badly written (or translated, at the very least) that it actually made me angry. Such poor use of language, and the attempts at dialect were plain embarrassing. I only persevered reading it because of a friends' recommendation, and it got worse as it went on.The content of the story, if you could find it, was passable, and might even have made a good book! but the way it was delivered was a huge handicap. It is a very sad reflection on modern life and literature that women are so desperate for a discussion of womens' roles and relationships that a work so lacking in skill with language,structure and characterisation can become a popular hit.Perhaps these women have never read anything of lasting merit to recognize the truely mediocre (if not the execrable) when they see it."
1,Confusing,"Could not keep track of who's who. Back and forth in time with like names: Hanna, Johanna, Anna etc. Both me and Mom (avid readers) got tired of trying to figure out who's who. Hard to read in bed at night, usually gave up and went to sleep"
2,Brilliant or just so-so,"The book contains an interesting collection of short stories. Being a SF master, Aldiss cannot escape the fate of old-fashioned writing. His style resembles the ""Classics"" of SF, and is not to the taste of the Matrix watching generation.Just like what others had said, the first three ""Supertoy"" stories are good, then the rest becomes rather irrelevant. Kubrick and Spielberg seem to have good taste, in mainly adopting the first story in the excellent movie A.I. It's worth buying the book just to read the first story."
2,Do Not Buy This Book If You Are Drawn To It Because of A.I.,"Although A.I. is based off this book, it should be noted it's loosely based. The short stories in this book that are on the supertoy theme are only a very small portion of the book. They do not lend any insight, (as many other book which movies are based off of do), to what was going on in the movie or provide any answers to the Kubrick/Speilberg turn of events in the movie that made you wonder what was really going on in their heads. This book may in fact be an excellent book, but I only bought it for the basis of being the basis for the movie and was sorely disappointed. If only I had known it provided nothing much to A.I. except a very loose plot for the beginning of it and some names. I know this isn't a glowing review, but I only wish I had known it didn't give me that information before I had bought it and perhaps I'll prevent this book from being bought by a reader who can't appreciate it."
1,disappointing,"I bought this book based on the connection to the movie A.I. I am always interested in how a science fiction story or novel has been converted to the screen. I was suprised to find that all the stories except for the cover title were written recently, rather than in the time period of Supertoys, which was 1969. I have read a little Aldiss over the years and find him an OK science fiction writer with novels like Helliconia Summer. I thought the other two Supertoys stories, while written 25 years after the original, did a good job of keeping the tone of the original, they just weren't that interesting. The remaining stories were not enjoyable to me at all and I finally gave up without finishing the book."
2,"only ""supertoy"" is worth to read","The supertoy story is quite different from the film, but I still love it because it gives another angle to see what happens to the the supertoy. In actual fact, I love this more than the film. However, the rest of the stories are horrible. Maybe the author want to espress his worries and negative views about the future of human life. However, he kept repeating the same idea all over the other stories, which really makes me fall asleep. Some of them I think they are NOT stories but simply author's theories about future and the bad sides of human beings. Sometimes it is really hard to understand what the writer want to say. In my point of view, the publisher just put all those stories together and make a BOOK to sell. Only the few pages about the supertoy is worth to read."
3,Game is fun but not the best version,"I like the Jewel Quest series but do not enjoy it as much on the MacBook version. I enjoy the versions for the iphone and Nintendo DS much more. Some of the features that exists on those versions are missing in this version for the MacBook - like the coins and the ability to have the monkey heads drop off the screen when you plan it right. The goal to achieve as much coins as possible is added motivation to continue. I find this version a bit boring after awhile.I also find it not as fun playing on the MacBook with a mouse, the moving of the jewels for some reason is harder and seems slower. It was easier on the iphone and Nintendo, but maybe that is just me. I play other Match 3 games on the MacBook and enjoy it much more and don't find it difficult to move the pieces as in this game."
3,Color variance,"The light blue color is different than it appears online. Had to return them b/c they didn't match the scarf they were going with. Other than that, the quality of the glove was great."
3,Honda snow blower rubber,"Made for Oregon equipment, but, fit Honda. Seemed very flimsy compared to Honda originals. I will but genuine Honda parts again."
3,3 1/2 stars,"The fourth book has turned out better than the previous volume, but all in all I'm not impressed with this series. Very disappointed as you may know if you've read my previous reviews of the other three books.Writing is good, you cannot complain about that with Sigrid Undset. She is very good in her descriptions of the setting and the lives of Medieval Norwegians, its just the plot that I'm not crazy about. Its quite boring and I had no feelings for the characters. They were too whiny about things long past. It got real tiring after four books and over 900 pages. Moving on to something more interesting."
5,Marine Mammals and Noise,"This is and excellent book for the researcher, graduate student, or undergrad (with some physics under his or her belt), who wants to learn about the effects of underwater noise on marine mammals. Currently this topic is the focus of much interest and is one of the most active areas of marine mammology research. Richardson et al. do an excellent job explaining the technical information, and have organized the book chapters in a logical sequence. Most terms are explicitly defined and the use of technical jargon is kept to a minimum. This book is a must for any researcher, or student, in the field."
5,Great product,"The book came before september 7 and it's really on good conditions, just like it had been described.And for those who are interested in ocean noise this book is classic."
1,MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,"I have always admired Roland Winbecklers' ""works of art,"" so when I ordered this book I knew it would take great skill and patience to do cake sculpturing. When I received this thin 35 page 'booklet' (not a book by any means!) with very few 'actual' picture illustrations (it only contained sketches), not to mention the very few pictures it did contain were black and white, I felt very cheated and didn't learn anything from it!Again, Roland Winbeckler is a master at cake sculpturing, he just needs to work on writing a BETTER and FULLER book if he truly wants to show his readers how to learn this craft; rather than charging [price] for this OLD worthless 'booklet'."
1,Waste of money,"This is part of a series, which is not mentioned in the product description, and is specifically designed to be used in a classroom setting. The pictures are mostly black and white, and is only 34 pages. The ""step-by-step"" instructions are far too sketchy and honestly very useless to your average cake decorator."
2,"wow, let me try to digest this",This was way over my head. I purchased this book because it was a roland winbeckler book and it was such a cheap price. This book attempts to instruct readers how to construct large cake sculpting projects that require PCV pipes. I'm just not there yet.
4,CAKE SCULPTURE,THIS BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING. IT IS AMZING TO SEE HOW CAKE CAN BE USED AS A CONTRUCTION MEDIA.
5,Great Book For Those Wanting to Learn Cake Sculpture,The latest edition (2007) of this book (purchased on Amazon.com) has lots of color pages and step-by-step photos of a sculpture being created. The price is very reasonable to be able to learn from 30 years of experience from the master of cake sculpture. The only way to not learn from this book would be to not read it.
4,Amazing,"You will be amazed by the cake pictures in this book. Some full, life-size famous figures all made out of cake and decorated to look like the real person."
4,très impressionant,"Vraiment impressionant pour les modèles, on dirait des tres vivant or derrière tout ceci, on peut manger ces oeuvres d'art. les images sont vraiment magnifiques"
4,Atmpspheric standout,"Ultra-low budget production company PRC managed to create real atmosphere thanks to decent sets and a uniformly excellent cast, toplined by Zucco and Atwill. Even the romantic leads are not wooden, as is so often the case. The storyline, although a bit over the top, none the less zips right along, holding one's interest until the darkly happy ending."
5,Creepy!!,In this 1945 film starring George Zucco and Lionel Atwill is about an island mansion that terrorizes it's visitors.This is one creepy must see Movie!!
4,Good bed time story,"Alejandro is lonley living in the desert. By accident, he learns that if he plants a garden, animals come for the water and shade and Alejandro's lonliness is lessened.But later, Alejandro learns that gifts given (the garden) makes the gifts received (the company) all the more sweeter.""Alejandro's Gift"" is a quiet book - no need for funny voices or wild antics. It makes a great bed time story or a great ""snuggle with your kids on a rainy day"" book.This can also provide a nice way to discuss nature and preservation with your children.There are lots of interesting things to look at in the illustrations. I read this to a group of school agers and they all enjoyed looking at the pictures and trying to identify all the different animals. We live far away from any desert, so many of these animals were unfamiliar to us.This is a good book and I definitly recommend it."
2,This is a Tiny Fur Child.....,"I got my first Fur Family book with real rabbit skin in 1946...first edition.The toy is cute, and is a valued part of my Margret Wise Brown collection....but the toy is somewhat smaller than the 5"" advertised and not as fluffy as the picture.It is reasonably well made and detailed. Definitely a collectible and not something I would give to my little grandkids to play with. The price is a bit steep for the size of the toy."
2,it's alright,"This mirror is no great shakes. It will do in a pinch - but the light is very weak, and altho it states a 10x magnification, it sure didn't seem like it to me.I would look a bit harder for something a bit better, this is a mediocre mirror and light - that's it - nothing special at all."
3,"where is the light in ""Lighted""","The service was terrific; I received my product sooner than expected. However, the lighing on the mirror leaves a lot to be desired. You have to hold the mirror in a certain way around the battery case in order for the light to stay light. Otherwise all is fine."
4,BURNING! VERY SENSUAL!!!,"WOW, this book is really great reading. I'm glad that there are the likes of Thea Devine who understands a woman's secret fantasies. There are only a handfull romance authors out there who are courageous enough to write sexy and sensual novels which a lot of romance readers crave and enjoy. More power to Thea Devine and keep on writing."
1,Silly Secrets,"First of all, the ""heroine"" was not technically a virgin. She was raped once, but she obviously got over that by the time that she was forced to publicly have sex with the ""hero"". The sex was boring, not at all hot. The repetitive use of the terms passion whore and passion nipple were beyond ridiculous. The story didn't work because there was NO chemistry between the couple and the plot was undeveloped and ridiculous. The plot could have worked with more detail and character depth, and the sex could have benefitted from the same. This book was bad enough to deter me from purchasing any more of Ms. Devine's books. There are definitely BETTER erotic and paranormal novels out there."
2,Don't buy it if you don't like explicit sex in your books!,"Sex, sex, sex, a little plot, more sex, vampirism, sex, paranoia, kinky sex, debasing sex, and other variations on sex, but it's mostly sex. And very explicit. But, then, I'm sure some people like that. This should be sold as erotic romance or erotic fiction, not historical romance."
1,Not worth money,this book has interesting start but the following story is almost nothing except sex and sex
2,No Plot,"I got this book thinking that it would be a fast paced, erotic romance. It was, but I had a hard time staying interested in it. We meet the heroine in a pub, essentially she is a stripper. She gets kidnapped, and put into a harem. Now there is a man that is supposed to be a spy, who gets kidnapped and made to be a ""guest"" at this same pasha's palace. When they meet, these two seem to be having sex all the time, in the most unusual circumstances. Which would be interesting, but I really didn't get the impression that they liked each other very much. They just liked having sex. The Vampire story line really didn't go anywhere either. It was like the author decided to just throw that in, for some added story line. I had a hard time finishing this book..."
1,Lacks plot and story line,"The heroine starts out as stripper then she is kidnapped, and is put into a harem. Then you have a man who is kidnapped, and then made a guest of the pasha. Then all of a sudden they are having sex with no kind of love or emotions at all. Then the vampire story was the strangest I have read, and I have read some really interesting vampire romance novels. Ms. Devine should have researched more on the vampire story line. Don't get me wrong, I like a good erotica novel. But this was a little to silly and I lost intrest after the tenth chapter. But this book is for anyone who wants read chapter after chapter of unemontional sex this is for you."
1,Not what I expected,I bought this book having read Thea Devine before and a few reviews online. I was lead to believe it would be a good sex story but also with a normal historical aspect to it (most of the times I buy more for the historical aspect). This book was hard for me even to finish and until about the last 50 pages I didn't care if I finished it at all. The sex was graphic but not romantic. I didn't like her vampire theme and the climax of the story (where good finally meets evil here) was just so lame.
2,"If you want soft porn versus erotica, this book's for you!","Sorry, I like erotica as much as the next person, but this book should be more correctly labeled for soft porn. In the first few ""sex scenes"", I was into it, but after that--I was really turned off by the language and attitudes of the characters. I understand that the beginning called for the way they acted; they were being forced into it by their captors. But after that, their scenes together never got any closer or more intimate. It was the same method and language as if they were still putting on a show for their captor. I have only gotten half way through the book and I am not even sure it is worth finishing. Yes, I want the really steamy scenes - but it is much better reading (for me at least) if there is some sort of chemistry and feelings there, even if they hated each other that would be something."
1,EVEN IF IT'S THE LAST BOOK ON EARTH...,"Like others have said the begining starts off at a fast past but after that you feel like you are reading the same thing over and over again, not a very interesting plot. And even the most desperate woman on earth would be bored after the 30th time non- emotional sex spread way too much thru out the story. The publisher who let this go must be jobless by now!"
1,"[Bad] book, stupid plot",I bought this book because it was compared with Anne Rice's work. This book is nowhere near the quality of book Anne Rice puts out. It's chapter after chapter of sex with a little plot that has a very speedy wrap-up (as though the writer couldn't come up with anything better). The plot seemed as though it was thrown in to try to make the book a little interesting while the sex was the main part of the story. I would never ever buy another book by this author. This book is not even worth the one star I was forced to vote but that was the lowest one I could give it.
3,Great Sex and A Ridiculous Plot,"I love Thea Devine's eroticism in her novels. The sex is explicit, detailed, frequent, passionate and graphic. That's why I buy her books, being bored to tears by most romance novels... However, the plot here with its vampires and pashas was both absurd and boring. Give me a plot between two historical lovers we know -- King Charles II and Barbara Palmer Castlemaine, Mary Queen of Scots and the Earl of Bothwell; or even two lovers we don't -- but at least give us a scenario likely to happen in this century or the last !... Thea Devine and Robin Schone and Beatrice Small definitely own the market of erotic romance, but the far out, otherworldly settings put a damper on this reader's enthusiasm."
4,Good for fine motor skills and pretend play,"The only reason why my overall rating was 4 and not 5 stars is because I don't understand why these are called ""soft peelable fruits"" There is nothing soft about them, they are hard plastic. They are attached by velcro and are peelable and come with a plastic knife as well so you can pretend to cut them also. I bought them because my daughters speech therapist had them, I thought they were great for not only teaching the sounds and names of the foods but also for developing fine motor skills cutting, and pulling apart the fruits and vegetables. It is also good for developing pretend play. My daughter is 2 1/2yr and has down syndrome, she pretends to feed them to her baby when I ask her to but when she plays with them and she doesn't know I'm watching she likes to pull them all apart which is great for manipulating with her fingers and building up strength for fine motor development."
4,Really cute and gets a lot of playtime,I ordered these for my son's kitchen and he loves them. He likes to make us dinner and cut the different pieces with the little knife. They're the perfect size for preschool sized hands. My only thought on these is that it says they're soft so I thought they'd be kind of squishy or at least flexible on the banana peel and the leaves to the lettuce and corn but they're actually hard plastic. Otherwise they were a great buy.
3,It's OK,Very cute. Great idea. Poor execution. Does not perform well. Hard to fit/keep pieces together. Causes frustration for for children.
3,Disappointed in size/scale,I ordered this for my 2 year old and he probably just wasn't ready for it. I've seen the wooden food with the velcro and liked those. I knew these were plastic but I thought it would be good to start out with. The bag it comes in is adorable and the pieces are of accurate color and the velcro works well. I guess what I was a little disappointed in was the scale and size of the food. It's all much smaller than I thought and they aren't in proportion to each other. IE: head of lettuce is smaller than the banana. The outer pieces are also fairly complicated to line up properly (like cover to banana or corn cob) so I definitely think it would work for older toddlers and children with the expectation that they are smaller
4,"Fun, interactive produce for kids","I bought this set for my twin 2 year old boys. There are enough pieces that both boys can play together. They can take everything apart all right, but generally I have to put it back together. The knife may or may not be used. I really like that the set includes both fruits and vegetables (unlike the similar Melissa and Doug sets), and all pieces are recognizable. The hard plastic seems to be really durable. We've had the set about 2 months now with no wear and tear, despite the fact that the boys haven't mastered the art of 'pretend' eating yet. I would definately recommend this set."
4,Incredible concept- small packaging.,"How cool is this toy? I mean you can peel the fruits. It's educational, makes pretend eating more fun, and there are many options. Only downside was how small the little tote is. When I received it (very quickly) I actually laughed. They just pack that little tote to the fullest. Not much fun for kids who're struggling to just put it in the bag much less cramming and walking around.Highly recommend."
5,Hours of fun!,"My 2-year-old daughter loves, loves, loves this toy. It has provided hours of fun since we got this for her a few months ago. She loves cutting the fruits and veggies. Very age appropriate for a 2-year-old. The only thing I set aside is the inside of the edamame because it looks like it could be a choking hazard. Also, the bag doubles as a fun and hilarious hat! Good purchase!"
4,Best of all our food toys,My kids love these fruits/veggies. We got them 3 years ago and they have entertained the kids from 2 through 6 years old.Fruit is much more durable than other softer plastic ones that get crushed and smashed.In the beginning the velcro closures are tough for little ones to tear apart.One of my kids liked to peel off the velcro bits so keep your eyes peeled!Would buy again!
5,perfect for kids exploring vegetable chopping,"I gave this to my two and a half year old for Christmas and he loves it. He loves chopping the vegetables apart with the knife and carrying everything in the bag. I love that it has such a variety of vegetables and healthy foods. I think it is especially clever in how you can peel the different vegetables, but it isn't too hard for a two year old to handle."
4,Fun & interactive,"I like how interactive these are. My son is only 19 months old, so he mostly takes them apart but sometimes puts them back together,;-)I got these fruits & veggies to go with this kitchen which my son LOVES: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GVS1UM?ie=UTF8&tag;=lotusmedia-20&linkCode;=as2&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B002GVS1UMI'm trying to encourage him to play in the kitchen without being underfoot while I'm trying to cook."
3,peelable fruits and vegetables,"While this product is peel-able and interesting to young children, the description as ""soft"" is misleading. My husband and I imagined cloth-like soft pieces that could be velcroed on and off easily. But, I purchased this for my 14 mth old and it is way too difficult for her to take apart and put together the fruit. All of the pieces are definitely ""hard"" and more appropriate for older children. Nice product if for child over 2 at least."
3,"Fun toy, misleading description","If I had read some other reviews I might have seen that these are not in any way ""soft"" as the description states. Otherwise, they are fine. The velcro is already a little iffy on a few, but they are cute, and my 2- and 3-year-old like playing with them."
5,A must-have for any play kitchen!,"This is one of the best play foods we have. The pieces fit together with velcro and the small (not sharp, not pointy) knife can ""cut"" through the various slices. The peas in pod and peelable banana are favorites for my 1 and 3 year-olds. Wonderful toy!"
3,fruit and veggies,"My daughter just didn't use/play with these like I thought she would. Took them apart but never really showed an interest in putting them back together or ""shopping"" for them."
4,Best Play Food,"These new interactive foods are great and bring a new level of play to the kitchen. I am dissappointed that the pineapple is no longer part of the set, it was definitely one of the pieces I was looking foward to. Good quality psltics and seemingly durable hook and loop fasteners. I really like this set because it includes both fruits and veggies rather than having to have two large sets."
4,Cute and Fun,"These are solid, well made, kid's play food. We just bought a second set for my neice. Not eveything is to scale with the other items, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5,"
3,Entoverse - is different.,"After the first three novels in the ""Giants"" series, Mr. Hogan get's a little crazy with this fourth book. By which I mean as strange and unexpected as the others were, this one really is ""way out there"", but it is still very well written and a practiced Sci-Fi reader (meaning someone who can selectively suspend disbelief) should find it an excellent read.The ""bad guys"", in the first three novels, the leadership of the Jevlenese, are now supposedly out of business and exiled. The hero is now on a mission to Jevlen, where very strange things are happening. He has to unravel the events and discover the ""unthinkable"" solution.Not as good as the first three novels, primarily because of the ""way out"" nature of the events, but still written well and a very good read."
2,Not so hot,it basically is a series of bad resumes and good resumes. No real direct help in terms of resume writing. Just read the whole thing and infer lessons from each example. I was more hoping to see some more direct information or advice. How to approach each section of a resume etc.
2,General Information,"The information provided was general, however the samples will provide a first time resume writer with the basic outline to follow. The information in some samples, such as a housewife entering back into the work force, were a bit too hyped up to take seriously."
2,"I have a job, but doubtful it's because of this book","I have a job, but doubtful it's because of this book.Seriously, this book is outdated and not on the cutting edge. Find something else."
4,One little problem...,"On page 84, of this book, it tells you to refer to the theraputic index on page 161. Well, there is no page 161. There are only 160 pages, the theraputic index is actually on page 156. Just thought you would like to know, but otherwise, this book has lots of good blends. Not a beginners book, you need to know about aromatherapy first before getting this book."
3,dense text all the way,"An aromatherapy book, in my opinion, should be as luxuriant as possible, aromatherapy being a delicious treat for anybody. I guess this book is okay contentwise, plus it's very compact and easy to carry around. But it's just too much dense text! No pictures at all, save for the one on the cover! Good to take with you maybe when you travel, in the event that you'll be needing an aromatherapy fix, but it won't be a stand-out in your library. Oh, and it has a section on Bach Flower Therapy, too, which I am not really a fan of."
2,There are better ways to learn Catalan,"As anyone who has tried to learn Catalan knows, this is the most available book. However, it is often difficult and pedantic. I found that the University of Girona website was far more useful. As mentioned by other reviewers, trying to learn Catalan without language tapes, is nearly impossible. I am currently taking Intensive Catalan courses, and learned more in a week than I learned practicing with the book. If one is able to aquire a dictionary, and a copy of Xuriguera's ""Els verbs Catalans Conjugats"", you will move faster. The University of Girona, has the best formed intensive language class I have found. Check out their website and try to get a copy of their book. Adeus"
4,He après un munt de coses!!! (I learned so many things!!!),This book was recommended to me by a website and it was very good as far as a language book goes.
2,fluff,"This book is pure fluff, there is nothing really usefull in here.There are a few examples of different blues licks etc.One decent section is the ""colorful chords"" that you can use to replace normal chrods in an arrangement to give somehting a little more flavor, without interfering with other insturments in the group"
2,Face Off,This book was recommended to me because I was looking for a sign book showing like hand shapes.The book is not about hand shapes but about miming. I found it repeated facial expression foreverything. I believe that facial expressions and body language are major parts of ASL. Thevariations of facial expressions are limited; they are repeated depending on context.
2,From Mime to Sign,"The book got here on time and looked like it was in good condition, but when i got to class and opened it the binding fell apart! I would say about 40 pages just fell out. So I had to go get the binding taken out and fixed.."
1,Burnt by Misleading Reviews and Product Description,"This is a replacement pen that only works on the Digimemo note taking system. This is not a stand-alone pen that I was looking for. This product was listed alongside stand-alone digital and nowhere in the description did it say this pen required the digimemo system. The comments were also misleading as they spoke of the digimemo product, not mentioning this is just a replacement pen. I got burnt hard on this one."
3,Report on 2 purchases,"The underlying product works great. I keep losing them. My first replacement had a battery that wouldn't stay put and it was very difficult to maintain it in position. Of course I have already lost that one and I am waiting for the 3rd pen. I like the tablet system, though."
2,Acecad Digipen,"I really like the DigiMemo that this pen goes to, but the pen itself is pretty cheap. Probably some design limitations they have to deal with. Also, I wanted a second pen as a backup, but I hope I don't have to keep buying new pens just to get the ink cartridges."
3,naaahhh,didnt really like it is more a intruduction to what happent to dragon balls and the dragons but is no meany action but is good to have it in my collection
4,Fiesta penguin,"This is very soft and is cute and fairly realistic, the only issue is that the feet are sewn on in a place that makes them not able to really hold him up well, so it is a challenge to keep him standing."
5,Sheer Wonderful,"She loves it. It enhances her curls and was glad she found it online. She couldn't find it anywhere else. ""She"" is my mother."
2,John Frieda Sheer Blonde Luminous Color Glaze - Platinum to Champagne,"I will not buy this product any more nor recommend it to. Absolutly no result, does not matter how you try to achive it. Glad that I spend money just for that one..."
5,the best one about this superstition,"Very systematic, yet full of humor.Each page is a real joy!If somebody is ""agnostic"" about the issue, he will stop.If somebody will (still) adhere to this stupid idea, he is really stupid himself!"
2,Reductionistic view of a worthy subject,"This book claims to examine reincarnation from a skeptical perspective. However, a true skeptic has an agnostic approach to the subject he/she is examining. One the other hand, Edwards (as well as most of the people who write for Prometheus Books) is a debunker. He had his mind made up and simply approached the topic with pre-ordained conclusions. What a pity."
3,So-so.,"This book is not really bad, I just didn't like it as well as I did NO SANCTUARY. I would not read it again; therefore, it is not a keeper and I cannot really recommend it."
2,Misleading,"I actually watched the trailer and the WHOLE movie. I thought this was going to be a lesbian love story between Vic and Kat . Well it turned out to be talk talk, talk, talk, argue, argue, argue, and one little kiss given to Vic by some other woman from her past. Both women seem to have romantic relationships with men in their past or present. AKA maybe Bisexual? Or was this just a friendship movie. I definately saw no friendship with benefits. Not that I was looking just for sex. And if you think you're going to get a bunch of punk rock and alternative music in this movie, forget it. They sang ONE song. If I remember right, there where two more songs from other bands. Unless you're a die hard fan of these actresses, go for it, otherwise, buy or rent something else."
3,"Meh, ok.","*some mild SPOILERS in review of this film*A good movie between former lovers, to enemies, to STRICTLY friends.I agree with the previous review completely. As a rock film this does severely lack, they do only sing ONE song... its a good song but thats it for ""rock"". I also found a few of the sitting and reflecting moments to be too long, some good blips to make you think, but mostly quite long winded. In addition to previous comments, I as well would like to have seen some love in the movie, rather than an often hostile then complacent rekindling of friendships. This movie did fall slightly short of expectation for those reasons."
2,"Don't bother, unless it's for a costume!","They are as bad as all of the other reviews say. But they served my purpose, I bought them to go with my Halloween costume. I also wear them around the house occasionally, but I can tell they're not going to last long."
5,Houseshoes,I love these house shoes. I have not been able to find them the last couple of years. If you know of any please let me know about them please.Linda
3,It was just OK,"Their previous book, How To Succeed with Women, was great. It covered everything, including how to talk to women. This book briefly covers some of the topics from How to Succeed with Women and then goes into detail about talking with women. This book is great as it encourages one to flirt with women by joking around with ""creative misinterpretations"". Of all the advice they give you, however, once you actually go up to the girl and talk, they tell you to not think about anything you have learned and just concentrate on the conversation. This makes it really hard to incorporate anything you have learned into real life conversations....All in all, the book mainly focuses on how to joke around with women, how to find out what women are passionate about. and how to turn a conversation into a romantic one (but by my experience this last thing causes you to sound immature and perverted). If you read this book, you are guaranteed to learn a few things..."
2,No smoke,"I have to admit that this book has some good advices for ""nice guys"" who don't get it. However, out of the 315 pages of this book, I would say only 50 pages are worth reading. The rest of the book is either repeated information or all common sense stuff. When I bought this book, I expected to see more practical examples that I can actually use in real life. But I was really disappointed that the few examples in the book are nothing special. I have a feeling that the authors are only good writers and researchers who did a good job in summarizing information about this subject from different sources and make it a book. But they are not true experts in this field. The thing they present in the book doesn't seem like the lessons from their real life experience. I wish I know them personally and see how sucessful they are in attracting women."
3,I feel a little foolish by using this material,I have most of their products. Overcome the nice guy its a good one if you are a shy guy. And how to be the bad boy women love is much much better than this one. In this book i feel like an uncool guy trying to be ridiculous romantic to seduce much younger women. I dont know if this will work - i will give it some tries and if i see good results i will rewrite my review with better rate. But by first glance this book is mediocre.
4,Good Book For Shy Guys,"Dont you just hate shy guys? I do--and I AM one!! We are so quiet and boring.When it comes to women,those devilishly attractive creatures we seem so attracted to,well we shy guys are often pathetic! If you dont learn how to approach them and deal with these empty-headed but lovely people,you might wind up with few,and unsatisfying relationships,or,worse NONE at ALL! THIS book,tho,offers great advice and a structure to learn how to change and be,well,LESS DULL and pathetic. To begin to reach out to women.Its great for beginners and longtime shy losers. I highly recommend it! L & C are the best place to start for aspiring pick up artists. Keep hope alive!"
1,The Dark Realms of The Internet,"""You will never satisfy a woman.Only a woman can satisfy herself, while you are but the mere connection that links the broad to something of monetary value.Go back to the dark realms of the internet from which you came from.Invest your time doing something meaningful on the internet; you will be more satisfied than any woman can make you.Close your eyes.Imagine a woman.Place your hand in your trousers.That is all the satisfaction you will receive from a woman.The internet has given you so much, and it has lead you here, the gates of Hell, for you to walk into unknowingly into an eternal abyss that is the woman's heart.Turn back!It is not to late!The internet has free porn!Rejoice, brothers!Haha!!!""Taken from the Authors Note.I was appalled."
5,"Bubba sparxx,the genius","Okay okay,i'll admit to being a fan of Timbaland's production but in an industry flooded with lyrics about ice,guns&sex,bubba 'delivers some unique material.Believe me,EM is not the only skillfull white rapper around.I'll ride with you bubba.This is your best album ever"
4,mystery,"I love a good mystery and this fits the bill. If you want a book that will entertain and cause you to be absorbed to the end of distraction,then any of Tim Meyers books will more then satisfy !!!!"
1,Really bad cookbook,How much are you supposed to spend for a 72 page book? I think $25 is a bit much. Why are some of the books in this series only $7.95? Is there some reason that the Latin American and Middle Eastern series are more expensive than the Thai?Buy a better and more complete book.
2,Nice looking but loud.,"I got this refrigerator and thought I might have received an unusually loud unit, so I returned it and got a unit that was possibly louder.This is a good looking refrigerator and anyone oblivious to noise will like it. If you're sensitive to noise, though, the high-pitched whine of the compressor will be a huge issue.I've had a Sanyo refrigerator (of the same size, earlier model) before, and it was quiet... so my noise expectations aren't unusually high. This thing just wasn't built with quiet in mind."
4,Verry Good,"Very nice product. Some people complainted about the amount of noise it makes, i really didn't notice that much noise.Maybe i got used to it really quickly or something buuut its really not bothersome.Fridge looks great and can be set VERY cold to possibly be used as a freezer (not sure tho, havnt tried yet). Only complaint is that standard beer bottles dont fit vertically, you have the lie them on their side. but thats really not a big deal.Very happy i bought this."
5,just the right size,Have had this refrigerator for about 1-1/2 years. Bought this for my wife's office. She loves it and this is the perfect size. Freezer compartment is a little small but I believe that's the size for these compact refrigerators.
3,Good Book,I got this book when I was considering getting a bearded dragon. It's a good book but not my favorite one that I found. I've had my bearded dragon for 6 years now and she is a wonderful pet.
1,Improper Information,"I hate to be the only one who has a problem with this book, but I can't keep my mouth shut. This book was poorly written at best, containing information that was erroneous and possibly detrimental to the health of pet beardies. The author relied on what I basically refer to as ""guesswork"" rather than actual documented bearded dragon information. Just enough information to be ignorant is a dangerous thing. If you value your pet beardie, don't invest in this book. If you are interested in a book with a lot of good (correct) information, I would recommend: ""The Bearded Dragon Manual"" by Phillippe De Vosjoli/Robert Mailloux/et al. It is by far the most comprehensive guide to the care of bearded dragons at all stages of growth and development."
5,I am donating this book to my local library.,"As an owner and devotee of ""Beardies"" for almost 3 years I have purchased a number of books and various sources of information on them. Steve's book is complete and well written enough for the experienced, as well as beginning Beardie owner. I feel it is an excellent source of information for those researching these wonderful ""pet lizards."" I own this book and am purchasing two more from Amazon.com to donate to my local public library and the elementary school library so people will be aware of these creatures and have a good source of information on how to raise them. I take my Lizards to schools to show them to students and get lots of questions on ""What does it eat?"" and ""What do you have to buy to keep one?"". This book answers it all in a format that is easy to read and understand."
1,Poor Information Source,"I find it hard to believe that the Author has ever owned a Bearded Dragon. If he did or does he never spent any time observing them. This author gives contrary information to just about every other source out there. This book would be better titled ""How to care for your short lived dragon"""
4,Simple but Effective,"Draja Mickaharic is one of the few authors writing on the subject of magic today who isn't afraid to say what should be on everyone's mind: if it doesn't work physical results, then its not magic.This simple, common sense approach to the subject permeates Mr. Mickaharic's book. This isn't an exhaustive introduction, but a precise one. In it, he describes briefly the preliminary training required (2-4 years is a suggested minimum); then goes on to introduce the topics of religious magic, ceremonial magic, deific magic, necromancy, astral projection, elemental magic, and natural magic. He also provides concise practical exercises that are easy to understand.It should be noted that this book is an introduction, a concise summary of magic. As such, it doesn't go into very much detail on any one topic. But if one is looking for a concise, no-nonsense introduction to this subject, this is a good place to start."
5,Buy R2 version,This movie is great when you see the original version.This version is crap.....UK release is in widescreen and runs about 12 mins longer.
3,Very Original,"It starts off in a wicked/funny manner with the googly eyed Jack Dante character..it's rather exciting throughout the movie and there is some blood. Ely Pouget who plays 'Hayden Cale' does a good job as well, she really gets intense into it especially near the end, that's good acting, you can feel the heat watching her. The giant robotic machine-thing chases them throughout the film and are subjected to Jack Dante's crazed sense of humor. Brad Dourif gives memorable performance i won't forget and neither will you after you see this movie!"
3,Terminator like film,"B-category Terminator like film. All activity goes inside one building. Strong film, worth its price.minus * because of Dolby Prologic, minus second * because of non-superior suspense."
1,Firmly seated in the pantheon of horrible movies,"Let's begin: this is by far one of the top 10 worst movies i've ever seen. I saw this on some Fangoria list of ""100 best horror movies."" Don't be fooled for a second THIS IS NOT A HORROR movie, unless you consider some crappy robot creation running through walls chasing fat men and weed smoking hippies terrifying. Steer clear of this babbage-ry."
4,A good change of pace,"I liked this movie because it mixed horror with a touch of scifi. Yes, it was a B horror flick with cheap special effects, but they did do a good job with the story and the movie. It was along the same line as the movie The Shaft but with alot more action and suspense in the movie. See this movie if you would just like to kick back and not think about much except enjoying a good movie."
4,""" ...Turn thAT 1980 **** DoWn....""","A MUST SEE!!!!!! All in all, I was a great movie with forgivable flaws. The best aspect of the movie for me was the humor. The characters were great and the weapons designs were awsome."
1,Boring,"Brad Dourif is an excellent actor but this is not his best work. It seems like any director trying to make it big in the 90's ripped off Terminator 2 - Judgment Day. They saw the money it made and people thought, if I had a film with robots then people will love it! So directors came out of nowheres and robot movies popped up on straight to video for the next few years. Ive never seen a decent movie made about killer robots. Decent effects but not alot of wow i'd love to see that again."
1,Don't waste your ten bucks!!,"It's a B sci-fi horror movie. It's not half as good as ANY outer limits episode. Poor acting, laughable plot. I appreciate many odd and low budget movies, this isn't one of them. The Sci-Fi Channel wouldn't even play this one at 3 in the morning on a weekday. However I know there is somewhat of a cult following for really bad B Sci-Fi and Horror movies from the 80,s and if thats you, then this movie may be perfect. Enjoy :)"
5,"Lots of big words, but good stuff!","Yalom is like a group work God. If you want to know how to practice effective group work, this is the book you want to read."
4,happy customer,i was very pleased with the product i ordered arriving on time and in the condition promised
2,THEORY AND REALITY,"Dr. Yalom is obviously an intelligent individual who appeals to graduate students in psychology with little if no knowledge of group psychotherapy. In theory everything is wonderful, interesting, and exciting. In practice, well that is another story. It will be interesting to see how well one is able to translate the book into actual practice where the value and importance of any text becomes glaringly known. Having been a student and clinician and professor, I can attest to the bewilderment students experience when they begin running groups and this book is not one that a novice can fall back on to survive the trials and tribulations of leading groups. It is a good read, like Freud is a good read but needs to be viewed more in a historical sense rather than a practical sense."
2,The Novel of Psychotherapy,"Even though the Yalom's textbook has helpful information, it reads and appears to be written like a very long novel. I would have preferred to have a detailed, concise breakdown of the information rather than a long story like textbook."
1,"Dry, Starchy, and Boring","Yalom's book is supposedly the quintessential book on group therapy. He writes as a very intellectual and highly educated man who seems to really need the reader to venerate and appreciate said qualities. I have an excellent vocabulary, and appreciate learning a new 50-center here and there. However, this book reads as if Yalom first wrote the book and then went back over the entire thing with a thesaurus and exchanged every possible word with a more abstruse, esoteric, or recondite word. The result is a garrulously verbose text, which is not even written in APA. Every citation has to be sought in the 83 page appendix of references. This is the most tedious and boring book that I have ever had the pleasure of using as a doorstop."
5,Great Condition-Shipped quickly,Yalom is the master of group therapy....his work isn't the easiest to read but he is the master. If you are considering a field in clinical psychology then you will just have to deal with his lengthy book. Yalom has done extensive research and this is a great starter book for learning the ins and out of group therapy. It is also the kind of book that you will keep and refer to years to come.
5,One-of-a-kind,"This was my first book read by this author and I was so impressed, I have completed about 10 of his other books. In grad school, I wrote a paper on Yalom's views on transference and countertransference. Highly recommended for everyone who counsels regardless on their counseling methodologies."
4,"Up-to-date info, reader-friendly, great for textbook!","This book contains the same basic information as a traditional textbook but in a more interesting and palatable format. Easy-to-read, great case stories!"
4,Comprehensive,This is a comprehensive and well written book for any student or professional needing to learn more about the group counseling process. This is definitely a book that will stay in my library for years to come.
4,Masters Student,"This was a very helpful manual for Group Therapy. It was a little lengthy in spots, but I would recommend it for anyone interested in improving their skills as a group counselor."
3,Poorly Made,"Bought this book for class and was impressed with the relatively cheap price for such a large volume. Well, after reading a few chapters is has become apparent that the price is indicative of the quality as it has completely fallen apart (the binding come undone almost immediately)."
3,DOES THE JOB BUT GOOD BE ALOT BRIGHTER,"SHOULD OF KNOWN TO BUY STREETGLOW, THEY ARE JUST OVERPRICED AND WAY BEHIND IN THE LED GAME, I GOT THESE FOR A GOOD PRICE, BUT THEY ARE NOT BRIGHT AT ALL COMPARED TO OTHER PRODUCTS THAT OTHER COMPANYS MAKE, I DIDNT EVEN USE THEM AND JUST THREW THEM IN THE TRASH"
5,A superb book-what romance and modern fiction should be,"I loved this book. It's not often a novel makes me cry, with this one I couldn' t stop crying, but laughing too.Jewel the heroine has such a wry way of looking at the world that we can identify with her easily, yet she is full of love and does her best to cope like everyone else with some horrendous circumstances. Hers is compelling first-person narrative and the talented author gives her a very strong voice, part comedian part earth goddess, all woman.Every character is a little jewel that sparkles, and the hunky heartthrob Malachi is even to melt your bones. The love secnes are wonderful--only wish there had been more!!A beautifully written book-I couldn't put it down, raced to the end and then re-read the whole thing to really savor it. I will definitely be reading more by this fabulous author."
4,No Place Like Home,"This is my first book by Barbara Samuels, but I do plan on reading more of her work. The book tells a heart warming tale about love, loss and family that touched my emotions on more than one level. The charactars were brought to life on the pages and the town of Pueblo, with all its traditions, a place you would want to plan to visit and stay awhile. I would highly recommend it!"
5,Another triumph for Samuels,Don't we all wish we could go home again and make it work? Beautiful book and one of my all time favorites.
4,compelling characters,"I enjoyed this book with its compelling characters. I was a bit disappointed at the ending that didn't resolve some themes that were carefully developed throughout. However, it is well written with excellent character development. Overall, a good read."
2,Apt title - forgettable new album from Krauss,"I'm sorry to say that Alison Krauss appears to have sold out to pop music - very little evidence of her bluegrass roots despite the great players (Douglas, Bush, Block and other Union Station members). Sadly, the songs aren't particularly memorable though ""Ghost in the House"" was worth waiting for. Hardly any of Alison's great fiddle playing or Ron's banjo - the more subtle bluegrass string rhythms are replaced by drums (allbeit tastefully done - like everything else). Technically superb but missing the honesty of ""That Old Feeling"" - I'll go back to my Claire Lynch collection again.I Clarke (Bluegrass Fan, N Ireland)"
2,YAWN,"Yeah, I used this album also. For putting my kids and me to sleep. Where is the old Alison? I miss her."
2,forget about it says it all,"A huge Alison Krause fan bites the dust. This cd is DULL ! Gone are the clever arrangements that made the band so popular. It seems she recorded this one half asleep. I knew they were going that way by their last cd, but I bought it anyway. If you plan to buy it, FORGET ABOUT IT !"
4,Not the bluegrass album that I expected!,"Still wonderful music, but I felt a bit betrayed that Alison left the music that she obviously loved so much....the music that made her a recognizable talent.....bluegrass! Her voice is still magnificent and the music is still wonderful, but it's not the bluegrass album that I expected."
5,awe inspiring,"As I get older I find that what I like musically, what really moves me is music well done. I have never heard anyone who has more control, who knows her instrument the way Alison Krause knows and uses her voice. The rest of the music is beautiful, tasteful and even masterful in it's elegant simplicity... but that voice! Pure and fluid as water. She doesn't rely on gimicks or excessive vibrato. Awe inspiring. I'm hooked."
5,What A Voice From God,"I Just heard Allison Sing with the Boston Pops on Public Televison...I was so blown away by her voice I taped it and ran to the computer to order this cd. Her voice is so clear yet not overpowering yet PITCH PERFECT, Truly a Gift from God. I can hardly wait until I get this cd and I will be ordering anything else she records."
3,Not her best work,"The previous review (Joesph Townsend) used the exact word I was going to use in my review ""haunting"" this esp. describes the 4th track ""Maybe"" and (no pun intended) the 7th track ""Ghost in the house"" For Alison fans like my self this comes at a bit of a culture shock. I was expecting some thing a little more up beat and blue grass like. Alison, in this album displays an amazing range and versatility that any other artist would be proud of but we have come to expect from Alison Krauss. This is by no means a bad album, Maybe over time like MR Townsend, it will become my favorite Alison album but for now I still prefer her more up beat albums like ""Every Time you say Good BY"" and ""Now that I've Found You: a collection"""
4,If M&M's melt in your mouth......,"then Alison Krauss's voice melts in your ears... I am generally a progressive rock, progressive jazz fan, but I have become an Alison Krauss fan over the last couple of years. ""Forget About it"" is wonderful to listen to. Her vocals are very pleasing to listen to, her band is always tight and the production is fantastic. Based on some of the other reviews, I get the impression that some fans were expecting an up tempo album, like ""So Long, So Wrong"". This is not one of those, but I think her sound does not have to be up tempo to be effective. I am drawn in by her voice and the music. I am a grown man, but when I listen to Alison Krauss' ""Forget About It"", I feel like I am being rocked in her arms like a baby, and that is very nice feeling..... This is a most enjoyable CD."
3,Did they shoot the banjo player?,"If you're a bluegrass fan, HeadsUp...this is not a bluegrass CD!! This is country/pop music on valium. That said, it's a pretty good CD. In this one Alison departs from her bluegrass sound and produces a very mellow and refined country/pop cd with an intimate style that showcases her vocals. Very few bluegrass artists have the vocal capabilities of Alison Krauss, so this does'nt happen very often. Bluegrass fans will be disappointed, but the hardcore Krauss fans will love this one."
2,not her best,"I am a hard core fan of Alison's as I have every album she has done, and I have seen her in concert twice. This is most assuredly NOT her best work. Where did this stuff come from? I am so disappointed, as I feel she has maybe sold out to the money gubbers here, which I guess I never felt she would do. This is fluff music, Alison. Please go back to your earlier works and listen carefully. Now listen to this new album. Ask yourself, ""is this is the way I want my career headed?"" Hmmmmm."
5,"It is not the type of music but her ""voice"" ...","Unbelievable. I am a Country music and Bluegrass fan by heart, however, this CD is exceptional. What has always defined Alison Krauss for me has been her voice. While this is a departure from her previous endeavors, it is no less engaging and enjoyable. She is also one of the few artists I have heard that can sing a collection of ""sad"" songs and still leave you with a smile. While the CD is not for every mood (eg. if you are looking for something to motivate your run, this is probably not the CD to listen to), however, it should fit most musical tastes. Buy the CD ... you won't be sorry."
5,Excellent in every way,Great CD. Excellent show of talent and emotion. Good recording quality. Excellent songs and performance. Goosebumps!
3,Dissapointment,"I've got 5 star expectations, and all I'm getting is 3 star sound. Alison has left her sound behind with the last 2 albums, and she certainly has a right to (she probably wants to experience something new). But I can't help to feel dissapointed."
5,Five stars isn't enough,"Can this woman make a bad album? I don't think it's possible. The song ""Ghost In This House"" is so good I'd buy the album for it alone. When she holds a note, her voice is so pure you're amazed anyone can sound like that. Words can't describe how great this album is, so I'll stop trying. If you're wavering, just buy it!"
3,just too impersonal,"Alison Krauss has a dazzlingly beautiful voice. I have bought several of her cds, hoping to find the one that speaks to the heart. But for me, her voice is just a little cold, just a little impersonal...the direct opposite of say, Johnny Cash, who couldn't actually sing, but his delivery almost always stirred true emotions. This cd is another clinically perfect item from the refrigerator, in my opinion."
3,Has a lot going for it,"I bought this CD based mostly on it having 4 star avg. reviews, it's not too bad. Some songs were more pop like than others, some more bluegrass but none of them were weighed down with ""modern"" elecronic noise, you just get good traditional type instrumentation. Track # 11, Dreaming my Dreams with you, was one of my favorite tunes, it has more of a bluegrass theme."
2,Thinking about buying? Forget about it.,"So this is Alison Krauss's ""pop"" album? This CD has no pop -- and no snap or crackle, either. I grew quickly tired of the whispery whining and mid-tempo, sleep-inducing melodies. There is a sweet gentleness to Alison's voice, but she desperately needs to let her band find a beat behind her. If her next album is any slower, check for a pulse!"
4,"Forget about it. No,no, not at all.","This album is a winner. She`s great looking that`s for sure, but when listen trough when youre heart are in pain, and youre soul are swinging from up and downs, this album gives you medicine. With Jerry Douglas on Dobro, how can you miss the focus on great music. The voice, mmmm the voice, has a certain signature to it . It could be sometimes to softspoken to lift it up to a 5 star. But you certainly will put it many times on your record player, and you can cancell your therapist, that day. To say it with Allison Kraus: (Track 11):Dreaming My Dreams with you: It makes you to a walking lullabay the rest of the day. It`s an earbalsam song that will knock you over."
1,This album isn't even close to her previous efforts,"I bought this album, unheard, based on how much I've enjoyed Alison's bluegrass music for years. I own every album she's ever recorded (I think) and expected this to match up. It doesn't come close. It's elevator music from start to finish, although there are one or two memorable tracks on the album. I even listened to it several times to see if it would grow on me but it didn't. The music just didn't inspire me to pay attention. Elevator music. Bah! Alison, where have you gone??"
1,WHO IS THIS?????,"this album has nothing appealing about it.....I was a huge fan of ""so long, so wrong"" as well her older stuff, but was sadly disappointed with this new album...it sounds like elevator music....you still recognize her pretty voice, but the music is so boring.....if you like the bluegrassy stuff, you probably won't like this....I sure didnt....I want to return it....."
2,So Disappointed...,"I was very disappointed in this CD. The only track I like is ""Never Got off The Ground"", only because it is the only cut on the CD that even resembles Bluegrass. Please Alison, please give us more ""Everytime you Say Goodbye"" and ""Two Higways""."
3,lovely but unengaging,"Love Alison's voice, style and previous works. This disc is probably too sophisticated for me, I am probably not getting the nuances that I trust from her previous discs are there. I miss the balance of instrumental strength that was such a staple. But still a very nice collection."
4,"Sounds good, but she should use more vocal power sometimes.","I enjoy listening to this CD, it has a soft and emotional quality rare these days. I have always loved the music of Alison Krauss and Union Station. Although I am generally not a fan of Bluegrass music, theirs transcends the genre. I find that while I don't exactly miss the bluegrass tunes, I do miss the variety of tempo and style on past CDs. I've heard Alison Krauss sing live, and she possess a lot of power behind the sweet whispery quality of her voice on this CD. She doesn't use it here. With some added vocal heft ( as in the song ""Georgia"" on Now That I've Found You), I'd give it 5 stars."
5,Buy This CD!,"In a career that has seen each new release surpass the brilliance and subtlety of the one before, Alison Kraus has managed to make the country pop album many have tried to make, and done it with her usual understatement, grace, and bottomless well of talent. I was expecting a joyful experience, and instead was utterly blown away - again. I had the priviledge to see AKUS a year ago at the Portland Zoo and I thought I was in the presence of the tightest band I had ever heard - and they were playing joyfully. This CD is not a joyful one, it is about heartache in all its many forms. But it surely shines its own light. Buy this for yourself, for a friend, anyone who will enjoy some genius in their life. It does not get any better than this. And if you ever have a chance, go see her live. This girl can PLAY!"
4,it tears your heart out,"I'm going to her concert on 11/14/99 at the Keswick theater. This will be the fifth time I've seen her and her band, and I've never been disappointed."
5,"Excellent, haunting, moving, wonderful",Alison Kraus' voice is awe inspiring. What a lovely way to celebrate her new life - a new husband and a new baby to boot. Congratulations Alison on a job well done.
5,"This is a gorgeous, intimate, subtle album","Alison's refinement and subtlety continues to grow in this album, and it's true--she doffs artificial boundaries of what's permitted by this or that genre of music, working instead from a palette textures and tones that surround and make space for the lyrics and emotions of each song. Each song is achingly true--and Alison's phrasing and delivery gently exposes layer upon layer of emotional complexity.The first time I listened, I kept waiting for the uptempo bluegrass number...it's not there. Clearly Alison had something else in mind--and upon second listening, I was caught up in HER vision, not mine. It's the work of a genius."
3,Alison plays it safe,"After having an unexpected mainstream hit with the song ""When You Say Nothing At All,"" which resulted in the ""Now That I've Found You: A Collection"" to sell over 2 million copies, Alison Krauss seems to be in a bit of a quandary. The result this time around, seems to be playing it a bit safe, and as if she is trying to have it both ways in an effort to hang onto her bluegrass following while not turning off newcomers she won over with the hit.This CD is pleasant enough, but too safe for an artist who seemed to be more interested in her roots than having hits. I'm sure Krauss will return to her roots someday, but it might have been nice if she hadn't turned so far away from them this time."
3,"Nice, but a bit repetitive","Nice collection of songs that are a bit of a departure for Alison Krauss. Gone are the bluegrass arrangements and in their place are tasteful, and at time excessively subdued, acoustic instrumentation. While diehards may bemoan the new approach it is one that is hard to fully criticize except for the fact that it all begins to run together after a while. A more upbeat number of two would have helped to keep this CD from the somewhat repetitive feel it ends up having."
4,Haunting; great breakup album,"There is, as some of the critics say, perhaps a bit more production than necessary, but if you're feeling sorry for yourself and looking for the breakup album of the season this is it: hasn't left MY CD player all week. ""Never got off the ground"" is a lovely ol' bluegrass song, and ""Empty Hearts"" and ""Ghost in this House"" just slay me."
3,Not her best,"I've been a fan of Alison Krauss for a long time, so I pre-ordered this album. I'm not sorry I bought it but I don't think it's her best work. I think she's getting a little one-dimensional. The title song, ""Forget About it"" is nice but the rest of the album is repetitive. By contrast, the new Asleep at the Wheel recording is dynamic: perhaps what Alison needs is to record with some different artists. Still, she's a solid musician and if you're looking for relaxing, not challenging bluegrass, this is it."
1,Will the real Alison Krauss please stand up...?,"Now don't get me wrong: I like Alison Krauss. A lot. Which makes this release all the more disappointing, since all the bluegrass elements which make Alison Krauss' albums special have been ruthlessly and almost totally wrung out. Although it still doesn't quite destroy the vocal power she can bring to bear, the syrupy backing supplied for Krauss' voice here did at times leave me wondering whether the record store had played some horrible trick on me and put a Celine Dion CD in the box by mistake...Will the real Alison Krauss please stand up...and quickly...! In the meantime, take the title of this one as a piece of advice, and forget about it."
1,One of the worst CDs I ever bought,"There might be a time when you feel really good. You are optimistic, happy and the world is just beautiful. But there is a great way to end all these feelings: Put on this CD! You will be depressed in less than 10 minutes. This is no pop. This is no country either. This is just another boring artist who keeps crying and crying....but it is NOT the Alison Krauss everybody used to know and love. Keep away from this CD, it will ruin your day!"
1,i thought it was terrible!,"The melodies on this song were quite despereate.The constant wine of Alison's voice does not give the reader anything to look forward to hearing.Check your pulse before you buy this one, cause I would never purchase a whining CD...not even in a heartbeat!"
2,Gorgeous Singing; Bland CD,"I have been a stalwart A.K. fan since I first saw her perform as a 17 year old. I own and look forward to each Allison C.D. however I have to say She under uses the brilliant Musicians of Union Station on this CD. Allison Krauss CD's are usually eclectic mixes of tempo; both achingly beautiful ballads as well as fantastic bluegrass playing by Union Station, however on this CD, one keeps waiting to hear the inspired mandolin and fiddle playing, and it never comes. Nonetheless since Allison has one of the most beautiful voices in Music today it is still worth while, however I would urge listeners to purchase Everytime You Say Goodbye, Too Late to Cry as well as Now That I Found You to get the full Allison Krauss and Union Station experience."
5,I'm a Convert,"Three months ago, someone could have said Alison Krauss' name and I would have replied, ""Who? "" Fortunately, I had the opportunity to see her in concert in Fairfax, VA. From the moment the lights went down and she began to sing ""Stay,"" I was hooked. Not only were the acoustics great in that auditorium, but her voice was (and still is)amazing. In a time where singers are trying to dance and lip synch, it was wonderful to see someone focus on the music. I bought this album as a Christmas present to myself and I'm glad I did. All of the songs are heavenly--the music is soothing and provide a perfect backdrop for a quiet night or a rainy day."
3,Lack of dynamics kills the album,"Alison Krauss has a world class voice, chooses great songs and produces them flawlessly. So how does this add up to a flawed album? Lack of variety. I like a pop ballad as much as the next guy, but an entire album of ballads leads to dull listening.One of Alison Krauss' great strengths is her diversity. Previous albums have shown her range over quiet gospel to swinging bluegrass. In this context her ballads really shine. But when there is little contrast of styles between the songs, the album drags on.I hope this album brings Alison Krauss the wide recognition and commercial success she deserves, and that it introduces a large audience to her tremendous back catalog. But I don't think I'll listen to it much, except perhaps on a CD changer set to ""random"" so I can mix it in with her other material."
3,Nice fridge but .....,"the freezer is a complete waste of space. About the only thing the freezer seems to be good for is frosting over. Have had this fridge for our computer room for just over 4 years now and it does a wonderful job of keeping water and other beverages nice and cold. Plenty of space to store lots of bottles of water, beer or whatever you prefer. If it wasn't for the freezer issue, I would gladly have given this one more stars."
4,Sanyo SR-3620K,"I boughy it for my office at work. It was larger than what I was looking for but it was the best value. The freezer takes a couple to freeze ice cubes, but other than that it has worked well. Recieved it in just a couple of days without any damage to shipping box."
2,waste of money,"This refrigerator is great - if you want to keep soda cold. The items in the door are barely chilled, not cold....the freezer either doesn't freeze at all OR freezes so well that everything on the top shelf freezes too...all without touching the temperature dial. On the positive - it's a nice size."
1,Might have been good if...,"The packaging hadn't been so pathetic. The tiny pieces of styrofoam, that failed to cushion the fridge during shipping, led to a fridge that arrived leaking coolant. The cooling part of the unit had come dislodged from the frame, and one of the pipes was broken and leaking. PLUS there was no crisper drawer included. I won't be buying a replacement from Sanyo!!!"
3,Nice Fridge but Door Design needs work,"This was purchased for the office and the door of the refrigerator has a very weak wire bar that goes across the bottom shelf. If you have tall bottles of water or soda, they will fall over every time you open the door. This is the only place you can store tall items in a vertical position, so now we have to lay them down on the bottom of the refrigerator. The freezer works well, and the refrigerator keeps things cold. We are just not satisfied with the bottom shelf on the door."
3,"Nice fridge, but inspect before plugging in",Fridge arrived with no damage to the box or outside of the unit. The only problem was that the compressor either was not bolted properly at the factory or it worked loose during shipping. I had to remount it and tighten everything up before plugging it in.It runs quite and gets quite cold. I recommend it overall but make sure you inspect it right away when you get it.
3,"A Tad Bit Greasy, but Fragraces OK","This left my skin (and tub) feeling greasy, rather than moisturized. The fragrances were OK, nothing spectacular. I tried the Pink Grapefruit which was more sweet than tart, the Cinnamon which had more vanilla and clove than cinnamon and the Sweet Organge which smell of a fresh, citrus grove. The presentation is cute, but frankly at $7 apiece, I expected a little more. I'll stick with my favorites by Haute Tub or Lush rather than purchase these again."
4,Good but not perfect,"I thought this kit was fun because I like to do crafts and it's nice to be able to eat off of the plates you've painted. This is a fun activity. But if you buy it, don't expect your plates to look like the pictures on the box: all perfect and smudge- free, because in reality, the paint is actually quite smudgy. That was the problem with this kit. The plates still look nice, just not perfect and proffessional."
5,HISTORIC VALUE RARE AVIATION BOOK IF YOU LIKE THIS ONE READ DOUBLE STRIKE,"This book is true excellence of factual accounts, the photos and media doccumentation is facinating. Jablonski was true Hero, his descritions of the crippled bird over Berlin and other cities is acceptional. Even if your not an Aviatrix you will love the history and coverage of Europe/East Block. If you liked this try to read his others:DOUBLE STRIKE, MEN WITH WINGS, Ladybirds: Women in Aviation and rarer to find.OH AND MEN WITH WINGS, and his HISTORY OF FLIGHT (a photo collection) wonderful,how he had time to write all he did-even GEORGE GERSCHWIN he wrote of, All his books are becoming scarce to find and a treasure to the Aviation Collector."
2,I don't want phone calls from vendors,"The product arrived, the vendor called me and wanted me to help them market themselves by posting here that they managed to ship the item. Yeah, it's fine now take me off of your calling list, please."
3,Pops Goes Country - Which this entire LP was on CD,"I am glad I have the LP entitled: Pops Goes Country with Arthur Fiedler and Chet Atkins performing these tunes:Country GentlemanTennessee WaltzAlabama JubileeFaded LoveIn the Pines/Wildwood Flower/On ...Windy and WarmI'll Fly AwayAdios AmigoJohn Henry/Listen to the Mocking...Cold, Cold HeartI'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue ...Orange Blossom Special"
4,Es un libro basico,"Este es uno de los libros basicos para los mastozoologos marinos, ya que se hace una revision sobre la evolucion de los mamiferos marinos."
3,Great Classic,I grew up with this video until we broke our copy. Quality is not up to par with today but it is an old classic so it's expected. It's a great turn-on-and-leave-it-playing in the background during Christmas. Kids will learn the words and sometimes people will stop to watch the scenes in the background.
3,bathing suit sizing,"The product was high quality, but too small. I reviewed the measurements to size ratio before I made the purchase, but the swimsuit seems to have no length. .. Good quality! Hopefully it can stand some stretching!"
2,Thin leather will not last!,"This belt looks nice and if it was just for show it would be nice to buy, but if it is meant to hold your pants up then it's not for you.The leather pealed back after initial use.The secound star is for the looking nice part."
2,Arrival,"While the music is certainly adequate, Journey without Steve Perry's soaring soulful vocals is simply not the same. His voice in perfect synergy with Neal Schon's guitar and Jonathan Cain's keyboard cannot be duplicated! This new Journey may have been better served if they chose a frontman with a voice in a different register that would not invite comparisons to one of the best singers in rock and roll history.We miss the original and hope that he will find joy in making music once again."
2,Has the New Journey Arrived?,"I don't think so. Arrival is an OK play, but Journey has never been just OK. Neal is Rock solid as always, but Arrival lacks power, and the majesty that has always made Journey music touch something inside us and make us want to fly. The songs are missing the beautiful flow we are used to, there's just no fire works on this CD. Is it because of the missing and much missed Steve Perry? I think so, but not just for his vocals. The three minds that made most of Journeys great music were Schon, Perry, and Cain. Without Perry's input the soul of the songs are in limbo. No disrespect to Mr. Augeri is intended, he sings a fine song. But Arriavl didn't give me goose bumps, didn't give me the thrill I have always known would come when I play Journey. It left me looking for the real Journey I love so much."
3,Just Isn't The Same Without Steve Perry,"Hey, I'll give them an A+ for effort, but if they wanted someone that sounded like Steve Perry, why didn't they work with him to get him back? While it sound's like Journey & it looks like Journey, it's just not the Journey from before without Perry. I have all their previous albums/cd's, but I was disappointed in the new ""Arrival"""
5,It grows on you...,"At first I really missed Steve Perry and still do, but take that out of the equation and this is still an EXCELLENT album. I have really grown to love almost every song which is rare."
1,Journey is dead. Long live Steve Perry,"Arrival should be renamed,Dead On Arrival.This new Journey album is truly a embarrassing,cynical attempt to make money on the ""Journey brand name"".Neal Schon and Jonathon Cain have sold their long time loyal fans down the river of corporate nostalgia rock.Arrival sounds as if were created in a focus group at Columbia Records.Journey fans deserve better than market driven music,designed to appeal to the mentality of a 3 year old. JOURNEY IS DEAD... LONG LIVE STEVE PERRY"
1,Disappointed,"I have been a Journey fan for most of my life. While I was very saddened to hear that Steve Perry was no longer with the band, I felt I had to give the New line up a chance. And now I wished I hadn't. The songs lack the emotion and feeling that Journey's music always held for me. I feel no connection to this new music as I have in the past. While some tunes do start my toes tapping this is now what I hoped (expected) to hear when I popped my cd in the cd player. With out Steve Perry Journey is just another band in the midst of many."
3,"Okay, sort of.","I have listened to many Journey albums. As a matter of fact, Journey Infinite was my very first rock n' roll album and it was on vinyl. Anyway, the music on this album is impressive, but the overall material with the vocals and the lyrics is not that great. There are some good hooks to enjoy, but it's hard for me to listen to the album anymore. I liked it at first, but have grown to dislike it. I was initially impressed with the new vocalist, but the lyrics were a little too corny and generic. There is not that much difference between this new guy and Steve Perry, but the difference makes a big difference in the whole scheme of their music. Steve Perry seemed to have more heart and soul in his singing. This new guy feels stiff and calculated."
3,"NEW SINGER, SAME SOUND","WAY TOO MANY SONGS FOR A NEW SINGER IN AN ESTABLISHED GROUP, AFTER A WHILE, JUST GELLS TOGETHER GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, NOT ENOUGH DIVERSITY ON THE C.D., TOO SOON TO TELL IF THEY SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR STEVE PERRY TO RETURN,,,,,"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!,"Steve Augeri,lead singer after Steve Perry left,was far and above the best vocalist Journey had. Not only did he master the Perry ballads but Arrival proved he could carry on the tradition of this great band sans Perry. I was very disappointed when he left for throat issues but recently saw him and he is as good as ever and wish him the best.Who knows if Arnel Pineda burns out maybe Augeri will be reunited with Journey. Journey's aggressive tour schedule is not conducive to giving a lead vocalist pipes the needed rest.Seger"
4,I love this cd so much!,"Journey's music has always inspired me throughout the years. Steve's vocals are just beautiful, and the musicianship is just great. I personally feel that this is their greatest album yet. Many of the songs just feel empowering. For instance, the first track is a great song to pop pills to. I mean, you listen to this music and you feel you can take the world on. After the divorce, this was the only thing that kept me going. This cd comes highly recommended. If you don't listen to it, then you won't ever be free. Come, be free."
2,I thought Neal was gonna ROCK more without Perry ! ?,"This is not a knock against Augeri,who puts on a great concert with journey.But Neal has said over and over that the problems with he and Perry was that Neal wanted to rock while Steve wanted ballads.Well,Neal had his chance.....and blew it.Nothing off ARRIVAL comes close to TRIAL BY FIRE's CASTLES BURNING as far a ""rocking"" goes.There are way too many average ballads on this album,although ALL THE WAY is a good one.It's not fair to compare any singer with Perry but I was almost sure that with Augeri in and Neal free to play how he wanted that this album was going to be great.It's good compared to todays rock bands(creed,matchbox 20 etc.)but disappointing for a journey album."
1,Worthless,The only reason why I gave this album 1 star is because there is no opportunity to give it 'Zero' stars.Journey is a novelty act. They've become the butt of many jokes.File under: 'Mullet Rawk'.
5,Augeri better than Perry!,"Augeri's singing style is warm and real, where Perry was pompous and self-absorbed. I couldn't stand Journey before Perry left, now I'm a huge fan. Here's to the future!"
1,Perry's not on this album....so what!,"Okay, Perry's a great vocalist, and a hard one to sound like. Who care's? I feel bad because Steve Augeri will not get the recognition he deserves. He just ""that guy they replaced Perry with"". Forget Perry and listen to the album. Augeri's vocals soar in this one. It's a pure classic Journey album. All the songs are brilliant. The rockers rock and the ballads will be considered timeless. If you like Journey, and I DO mean Journey, pick up the album. I think you'll discover there's alot more than just Steve Perry. By the way, Perry's solo albums, especially the second one ""Love of Strange Medicine"", is kind of weak."
1,If it isnt Steve Perry it isnt Journey,What an absolute waste of time and money. - NO. The new lead singer sounds more like Lindsay Buckingham from Fleetwood Mac than Steve Perry.Its just not worth the time nore the money. Barely a good track
1,What A Load Of Yuck,"I have been a fan of Journey for over 20 years. Steve Augeri is a very good singer. But if they wanted a trually great soulful voice with great range, they should have gone after HUGO. Who is 10 times the vocalist Steve Perry ever dreamed of being. Let's face it, the last great release was ESCAPE, from top to bottom that was one of the greatest albums ever. This is almost as bad as Raised on Radio... They should just break up for good and go about on solo careers again. Which by the way, Neal Schoon had some great solo releases. Stop putting out this garbage and salvage what is left of any credibility and hang JOURNEY up for good... They were once great, now they stink... The album sales are not that good, and they are not filling the arenas any more. Actually they are playing to half full small theatres... Trually very, very sad....."
5,Journey is still great!,"First off, who knows if this cd will hold a place in the hearts of millions, whether through a break-up, marriage or other significant point in our lives.........But it is Journey and it is kickin!!!!!!!! As a musician, this is the best I have heard the band. Neal really shows some new elements to his playing, a little spanish flamenco. The new Mr. Perry with a perm, great, Steve Perry, and Bryan Adams, and his own style in one. I am just glad to have another Journey album, buy it its worth it."
5,The Real Deal,"One word - fantastic! The songwriting is great, and you can almost feel the attitude that Augieri wants to be there. With Perry's overly controlling personality gone, this is a band gain, and it shows. This ranks in my Journey top 3, with the Live one, and Frontiers. ENJOY!"
3,Journey Again,"If your idea of the perfect Journey album is ""Raised on Radio"" or ""Trial by Fire"", this album is not for you. However, if you were offended by the pretentiousness brought to the table by Steve Perry during that era, you will love ""Arrival"". Some of the tracks on this album fit perfectly into the material from ""Escape"", and some into the pre ""Captured"" era. This is a rock album with solid writing and the signature sound that made Journey so special. If you like to smile, this is a must for your car CD player this summer."
4,They're Back,"I've always been a die-hard Journey fan. And I'm one of those who believe that without Steve Perry, Journey would have never seen the success they now have. But, this new CD is awesome. I'm always listening to the radio for new music that sounds appealing. Sad to say that in the last few years, I rarely hear anything that contains real musicianship. But putting Schon, Cain, and Valory back together will always bring forth exceptional music. And the new lead singer Augeri is impressive. He has the soul, range, dialect, and diction of Perry. But, what would Journey be without that kind of lead singer? I love the ""nostalgic"" solo on Signs of Life."
5,I don't get it...,"I don't understand why this wasn't a smash hit.. sure its got a 80's sound.. but if you like very well done melodic guitar work and a vocalist that moves you with every word I don't know how you couldn't love this CD. I am a guy and many of these songs (and I love all of them) make me want to weep. No other CD has ever done this to me. The emotion from Steve is sometimes overwhelming to me. And all of the music is well written.. If you are tired of the boring downbeat music of today pick this baby up. Listen to it twice and you will have a hard time putting it away for very long. Thanks Neal for showing us how to make a guitar talk.. you are truly talented. And Steve, no matter how many comments you get about being a Perry dupe.. keep it up... You have something Perry never had... trust me."
4,"Even Non-Fans of the ""Old"" Will Enjoy ""New"" Journey","I grew up in the 80's listening to punk and new wave, so I never considered myself a Journey fan. (Even though I slow-danced to ""Faithfully"" and ""Open Arms"" at many a high school dance.) I just recently got into the group by influence of my boyfriend who was a die-hard. We saw the band live in 1998 and was blown away by Steve Augeri. His similarities to Steve Perry are uncanny. Regardless of the comparisons, Augeri's voice and range are quite powerful and can hold their own.The last six tracks of ""Arrival"" are the best. I listen to the CD and hear not a Steve Perry sound-alike, but a performer with such soul and depth that you forget you're listening to Journey at all. Even the sounds of Schon, Cain, and Valory seem to have evolved.It has been a long time since I've come across a CD that I can play over and over without ever tiring of it. ""Arrival"" is a real winner."
3,"It's Not Bad, But...","Ignore all the hype that this new singer sounds like Steve Perry. It's not true. That's not to say he's bad, just that he is not Steve Perry. Also, lost in all the commotion over the singers is the fact that replacing one of the top 5 drummers in rock history has also altered their sound significantly. Again this isn't necesarrily a bad thing, in fact, I'd say the writing is quite good on this. If this had been released as a Bad English album, I'd say it was by far their best to date--I'd even go so far as to say Steve Ag is like hearing John Waite amped up to 10. Johnathan Cain and Neal Schon have some killer hooks--some of their best-- but with the Journey name hanging over it, I keep going back to the notion that if it were Steve Perry singing and Steve Smith drumming on these songs, this could possibly have been the best Journey CD of all time."
2,Just Deperate For Journey?,"Journey is not Journey without Steve Perry, even if the band technically got together before he joined. Listening to the songs on this album, it is obvious that the new Steve is just trying to imitate Steve Perry. He can get by, but he lacks the range, tone and depth of Steve Perry. He also does not physically have the same presence as Steve Perry. Like it or not, even though the other members are great, Steve Perry is Journey to the majority of fans who were in their teen and twenties during the 80's. I think it is fine that Schon wanted to continue in music, but he should have at least picked a new name for the band. Without capitalizing on the Journey name, I really wonder where this band would be without Steve Perry. This is an album for people so desperate to have Journey back (and I can relate) that they will accept anything."
1,Poop on Plastic.,"Wow, my name's Steve Au Jus--or whatever--and I can scream just like the prima donna I replaced. Not only that, but I sang the same song 15 times in a row. Ya hear? One song 15 times. I tried usin' this cd to help my pony count, but he got confused 'cuzzin' he didn't know when one cut ended and the next began. In fact, he had a nervous breakdown on me cuz last time I tried it with Credence Clearwater Revival, and it was the same result. My poor little pony's been through enough. I think I'll keep him away from the Peter Cetera and Boston stuff, otherwise he might commit suicide."
2,Journey?,"While some would argue that Journey existed before Steve Perry showed up, the truth is that Journey was a talented group of musicians without the voice or song writing ability needed to be successful. Then came Steve Perry, and the rest is history.... They have returned to their former selves (pre-Perry), only this time they try to sing and write. It was a dissaster. To support this argument I give you their tours. They are still singing all of the old Perry stuff, because they know that fans do not like the new stuff. The truth is, this album is a stinker. The positive reviews the new Journey is getting is not reflected in their record sales, and this leads most to believe that the positive reviews are less than genuine. Journey fans would have been much better served with more studio albums that include Perry and not this NEW BAND that is pretending to be Journey."
4,Great music for Journey fans,"If you like classic Journey, you'll like this CD. Some of the tracks seem to be trying a little too hard to be like the 'classic' Journey sound, but overall the musicianship and production quality of this CD is outstanding. Livin' to Do is an amazing song, and Neal shows that he can still rip on the guitar - this guy deserves so much more credit as an outstanding guitarist than he gets."
4,The journey continues...,"Those who are skeptical about the new incarnation of Journey should put all their fears to rest:the new Steve(Augeri)does justice behind the mic.'Arrival'is in every way a second reunion for this legendary band,having all the hooks and inspired songwriting they are known for.One of the best AOR albums of the year."
4,Journey is back!,"I was skeptical when Steve Perry was replaced. Journey hit the lotto jackpot when they found Steve Augeri. I think the mixing was sub par. I believe everyone wanted the spotlight and forgot it was the mix of talent that made Journey what they are. Neal Schon, Jonathan Cain and Ross Valory have proven they are Journey. They would have been successful together with almost any lead vocal with the vocal range of Perry and Augeri. The Album grows on you like any Journey album. I have been a Journey fan for over 20 years. I'm glad Journey is back. This is a must own CD for any Journey fan. My only question is why they rarely tour in Iowa?"
2,"Music o.k., Journey? NO WAY","The only thing I can say to all you Steve A. lovers out there, is that you must never really have gotten into the FEEL of Journey's music. This stuff has zero feeling to it. It's cookie-cutter polished garbage for the most part. Don't get me wrong, some songs are ok, and Steve A. can hit some notes, but that's where it ends. This CD doesn't move me the way classic Journey did. The only movement is running to the CD rack to pick something else out to listen to.And one last thing - if Neal and Jon wanted so much to move on from old Steve Perry, why is it that everything they do is so blatently Steve Perryish? (albeit done very weakly).Save your money, and if you don't already own it, buy Captured instead."
5,"Spectacular come back after the ""Trial...""","I think these guys deserve a huge amount of awe and respect. They have pulled off yet another absolutely fantastic album. I was a little worried after Trial by Fire, but all of my worries have been put to bed. I can't believe how they have held on to so much of what makes them Journey! They just seem to age like a fine wine. Steve Perry has got to be just a little bit green at this point! I think that Steve Augeri has done a great job. He has had to stand up to a lot of pressure from us old die hard JRNY fans, and as for this one in particular, he's got my vote to complete the NEW JRNY!! Neal, Jonathan, and Ross have all still got it. Maybe even better than ever! For anyone who has ever liked JRNY this is a must have album! And for all of you who are stuck on the other Steve, GET OVER IT!!! This is the next generation of JRNY and it totally ROCKS!!!"
2,Where is Steve Perry?,"I've recently been on the official Journey website and heard parts of some of theese songs. I have to admit, some are kind of catchy,but I would never even consider buying this CD because Steve Perry is not on it. Without him there is no Journey."
3,trying hard,"[....]Augeri, though a good singer and can pull off Perry covers, lacks a hard drive vocal to sell these songs for me. As I listened more and more, I find myself trying to hear Perry in some of the hard rockers for me to like the songs. The ballads are well written and Augeri can bring a softness to make them enjoyable. Perhaps they are trying to bring a new sound to edge out Perry but it will take some time. Neal schon kick [butt] as usual. hats off to the effort"
2,....meh,"What is there to say? If Neal and the boys decided to change the name of the band, like Steve Perry suggested, perhaps I would have liked this cd more. However great a singer Augeri is, he is a poor substitute to Steve Perry, he simply cannot capture the magic that Perry's voice brought to Journey. I compared Steve Augeri's singing to Steve Perry's the whole cd, and why not? Steve Perry, like it or not, was the heart of the band, he's the one that the general people know, not Neal Schon, Johnathan Cain, and whoever else is in the band. If you buy this cd expecting to hear the Journey you've grown up with, you will be in for a rude awakening, it's not them anymore. I aggree with what Journey's old manager, Herbie said, ""If anyone tried to make Journey disappear, nobody would be there to stop them."""
2,not bad...but not great,"The new Steve doesn't do the ballads as well as the old Steve. Yes A couple of the songs do rock, but overall it is the weakest Journey album they have ever released. I might add that I am not counting the original 3 which where great albums, but not comparable to the journey most people know. Believe what you want, but it is also the poorest selling Journey album ever."
5,Wow!!!,"The greatest Rock Record Ever Made!!!! Steve Augeri definitely shines on his first record with Journey. As a matter of fact everybody Shines on this record, it is the closest thing to perfection ever produced by a rock band, from the songwriting, to the production, sound quality. Everything just came together here."
5,"A great ""non-Steve Perry"" Journey CD","As a long time fan of Journey, it is difficult to consider any releases from Journey which does not include Steve Perry. However, after having an open mind and listening to ""Arrival"", I consider it not Journey's best, but certainly a very good, well-written and well-produced CD."
5,REAL MUSIC IS BACK!,"Finally a CD with songs that can rock and still have lyrics that go somewhere. I have recently become a CREED fan and like some of the newer stuff, but when you boil it down, it all really sounds alike, very cookier cutter sameness. Then along comes Journey, with a new lead singer, after the whiney TBF CD. Now way will this fly......WRONG! This cd is the best product they have provided since ESCAPE. The songs on this CD have heart, soul, great musical depth, and wonderful lyrics. ""Signs of Life"" could have been on the ESCAPE albumn. Augeri's vocals sound a lot like Perry but definately has his own style as well. A kind of mix between the voice of Perry and Rod Stewart. Schon has not lost a thing on guitar and the new drummer rocks! If you want a preview of the sound, check out the free concert on DSS. You too will be a believer. I guess I never should have ""stopped believin""."
4,Better than Trial By Fire,"I was so excited to get this CD becuse we just haven't had that much journey music in the last ten years. Arrival will take about three or four listens but after that you will be hooked on it just like classic journey. Arrival has the best of hard hitting rock songs, and great love ballads that do compare to Open Arms and Faithfully, and of course it has great piano and great solos by Neil. Journey is back and I expect them to get a lot of radio play, the tour is what I'm really excited about-enjoy."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a waste of time, effort and money.... Journey should just disband, or try to get Perry back!"
1,"Personally, I can't help but think",that this is the worst bluegrass album in the world! I don't hear a single banjo
4,VERY impressive!,"I like this album a lot. I've always been a Journey fan, so I wasn't expecting to hate it. But Journey without Steve Perry? Of course I was apprehensive.No need to be. I've listened to it twice now and I think it's going to rank as one of my favorite Journey albums. The ballads are great and the rock songs rock just the way you'd hope they would. Neal gets off some great solos on here and all the songwriting is very impressive. As for Steve Augeri - the man does sound a LOT like Steve Perry. Nothing wrong with that. It works. This definitely sounds like a Journey album.Lots of potential hits here. I hope radio stations give the album the airplay it deserves."
1,JOURNEY NO MORE!!!!!,"There is only one song that I would say was worth listening to. Steve Augeri has a strong voice but he lacks the soulfulness that Steve Perry had and the listener just knew that he had been down that road that he sang about!! That beautiful voice came from a place way down deep and it can never be replaced by Steve Augeri attempting to sound like ""THE REAL VOICE OF JOURNEY"", Steve Perry!!! After 20 years, and after watching the VH1 Behind The Music featuring Journey, I am convinced that Steve Perry at 52 years old, still remains the only true voice of Journey. The fact of the matter is that, indeed ,Journey needs Perry but Perry has proven time and time again that he can stand alone!!!"
1,The Journey is Over,"ARRIVAL This new release from the new Journey line-up suffers greatly from mediocre songwriting and from the lack of a strong lead vocalist.The new singer, Steve Augeri, tries his best to fill Perry's shoes but falls short. Augeri's vocals are a thin imitation of Steve Perry's, with only half the range Perry had. The songwriting is uninspiring. Aside from some enjoyable guitar licks from Neil, the songs are pretty unmemorable and do not have the emotional punch and melodic interest that past Journey music had.On Arrival, you really start to miss Perry's great songwriting abilities that were present on every other Journey album from 1978 up until 1996.This is NOT the Journey sound that we all know and love so much.On Journey's reunion 1996 album, Trial By Fire, Steve Perry proved that he still has The Voice...and then some!!! Its a real shame that he is no longer with Journey.I was hoping I'd enjoy this new album. But this new 'Journey' sounds, at best, like a Journey cover band."
4,"Appreciate it for what it IS, not what it COULD be......","First of all, I have to agree with the reviewer who commented on Augeri's vocal range. He CANNOT sustain a Perry-like note, and his rendition of Perry-era songs are unemotional, to say the least.....But I digress.....Appreciate this effort(and Lineup) for what it IS, and not what it COULD or SHOULD be! These 15 songs are great for what they are. Neal's guitar playing is better than it has been in YEARS, and Jon's songwriting is at it's best(just imagine Steve Perry singing these songs)...My favorites are: Higher Place, Signs of Life, I got a Reason, To Be Alive Again, and We Will Meet again....Although I'm a sucka for a sappy Cain/Perry ballad, Steve A.. just doesn't pull it off....I'll stick with the Power ballads and rockers from this CD.....Overall it's worth the money...FOR WHAT IT IS....Oh and as an aside..I've been burning to say this for 2 years....Kevin Chalfant, or Hugo Valentin(e) would have been a better choice than Augeri...."
1,"No truffle taste, a little truffle aroma.",Maybe this company has very poor quality control where some batches are wonderful and others are just olive oil with a whiff of truffle but our 2 bottles had no truffle flavor at all. Very disappointed. I will buy other brands next time.
2,"It is olive oil and ""Truffle Aroma""","Just so that you know what you are buying - the ingredients on the back are clearly shown to be olive oil and ""truffle aroma"". As another reviewer said - this is olive oil and chemicals. It's very disappointing to have paid this much for a wee little bottle (and it is wee!) of olive oil and chemicals."
1,"Truffle Oil? Well, at least the oil is real.","I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: http://bit.ly/2MRmyQAnd if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes..."
4,URBANI WHITE TRUFFLE OIL,"QUALITY IS EXCELLENT, LENDS THAT WOODSY FLAVOR. WAS DISSAPOINTED THOUGH IN THE SIZE, SMALLER THAN I HAD EXPECTED?"
4,"Samsung 42"" DLP TV","The performance of the Samaung 42"" lived up to my expectations. I comparison shopped SONY, SHARP, HITACHI and DELL before selecting the SAMSUNG. The luminosity (aided by the picture mode settings) is adequate for viewing in a well lit room. The picture quality is exceptional for HD channels and DVDs in the 480p mode(as good as any of the LCD TVs). Performance on normal analog channels is fair to good compared to direct view TV performance on the same channels (both HD and analog are off cable). Digital audio sound is excellent. The setup and custom adjustment menus are easy to use but sometimes annoying as the menus have 4 to 5 layers. The TV fits in a very small space for its screen size (width and depth are the smallest available for this size). The manual is good but assumes you understand HD terminology and doesn't explain the difference in performance when choosing many of the settings. I highly recommend this TV based on its price to performance delivery."
5,Great TV Great Price,"After tax and S/H Amazon was UNBEATABLE. The TV arrived promplty to the door and was in an obviously cared for condition.This tv is nothing short of amazing as it truly fits where others do not in addition to weighing next to nothing. My cabinet measured 39.5"" across and the specs on the tv were 39.3"". This measurement was dead on accurate!Samsung's technology is superior to all others in the price range. I hope this tv lasts a long time because I'm not sure what I'd do with out it now."
1,White Dots,"After about three years the DLP chip in this TV failed. The third-party replacement part was over $500 and Samsung refused to acknowledge the problem. I had been a loyal Samsung consumer before this episode, no longer. I spent +$1,100 in 2006 on this unit and now it's at the dump."
3,Good TV in the beginning but then the spots started to appear,"It isn't as if my TV is on 24/7 that I allow the screen to burn, but still in the left corner the picture quality is full of red spots! It is quite a nuisance."
3,Decided to go with plasma,"This was our first venture into the big-screen market, and we didn't know much about the different technologies. We were pleased with the look and feel of this TV, but the picture did not live up to expectations.We are on satellite but do not have an HDTV tuner yet. The channels looked grainy and had weird pixel movement in the dark areas. We were able to get the color and contrast just about perfect with some minor adjustments, and the sound was great. We realize that DVDs probably look much better, but on a day to day basis we don't watch DVDs, we watch regular TV.The picture looked awesome from across the room, but when sitting on the couch about 6-7 feet from the screen, it really didn't look that great. We explored a few more options in the stores and finally opted to return this TV for a slightly better price on a plasma.Bottom line is, the TV is probably fine if you have the right setup, but for us it just wasn't the best choice."
5,"Samsung 42"" TV","The TV is really nice. It works easily. I have it hooked up to a cable network. My friend also bought one about a week earlier and I liked hers, so I ordered mine. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a first class HDTV. The service is quick and efficient. The picture is fantastic!"
5,GREAT TV - GREAT Price ...,"I also have a 61"" Samsung DLP. Based on a small handful of reviews scattered over the net and the liking of my current 61"", I decided to purchase another Samsung. I've had my 61"" for a couple of years and truly enjoy the picture quality.After unboxing the 42"", my expectations were high. I connected the unit to my existing cable and hit the power button. The user menu has come a long way since my 61"" and again, the picture quality was great!Remember, garbage in garbage out:) The true test for image quality for any TV is DVD. DVD will produce the best possible image ... this when your TV will show it's true potential.I found the 42"" on sale and believe the quality for price leaves the buyer in the drivers seat."
4,Very Good,"It's a great buy. The only problem that I have is the ""DNle"" won't stay on and no one can seem to tell me how to keep it on. I get a sort of cloudy look, but it's tolerable. Other than that it's great. I'm pleased."
5,Great TV,"Wonderful picture quality in HD. DVD displays well too. Standard cable signal not really much difference. Would recommend this tv to anyone. Just understand that you need HD programming for this tv to really shine. The audio of this tv is ok, nothing special, but it gets the job done. I have it hooked up to a surround sound and love it."
5,A new name on the literary scene!,"This collection of short stories reads like the first shot in the war against the complacency that has settled on American literary fiction. These stories are fresh in every sense of the word. The characters that inhabit the world in Frelke's short stories are all living on edge -- you'll just be shocked to realize how close we all live to that same edge. Whether it's sailors in a foreign port, car salesmen the fishbowl of their salesroom, or regular stiffs eking out their lives in small town America , Frelke's characters are all real, all formed by the pressures of today's world. This author takes chances, chances underwritten by his talent, and they pay off. The beauty of this book is that the payoff will probably be your year's best read. This is seriously good literary fiction. Buy this book."
4,A bit finicky,"Worked real good the first time i plugged it in. Didn't use it for awhile and when I plugged it in it bombed my printer software, my wireless mouse, my web cam, and my internet connection. All software had to be uninstalled and reinstalled. After that, everything is working well again. Be careful how you plug and unplug things into this port. Very handy gadget to have and real inexpensive."
1,Don't buy the Ultra Slim 4 Port Self Powered Mini Hub,"We bought 12 of them for school all 12 failed the first week, most the first day. Returned them on 10/26/2006 still have not received new products or a refund as of 1/9/07."
4,Not as Good As Worm,"This is a cute follow up to Diary of a Worm, but it doesn't have the same humor or freshness as its predecessor. Cute, worth buying, but not to the same calibar as Worm."
4,Diary of a Spider,My grandchildren (2 & 3) both liked the book. My grandson loves spiders and he was excited about it. The illustrations were great.
2,"You Can Have Too Much of a Good Thing - a review of ""Diary of a Spider""","This one didn't entertain the children. From a mom perspective there are a few factoids and the concept that spider's shed their skins, but beyond that, not a lot to praise.The artwork is cute, but the material doesn't give Harry Bliss much to work with.Not awful. Just not one I'd suggest you buy. Diary of a Worm and Diary of a Fly were both better.Considerations :::Cute artwork but we didn't find it very entertaining. The Accelerated Reading Level is 2.3. The suggested interest level is Preschool thru 3rd Grader.Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksForKids-Reviews"
4,My Online Review of Diary of a Spider,"This amazing book is amazingly amazing!!!! I love it because it uses dialogue and voice and a lot of other writer's crafts! It makes it seem like a spider is like a human - which it sort of is; but I mean actually going to school! Well, I'm not sure if they do but they might, never mind! Anyway, this book is so good and I recommend it for kids/adults of all ages!In class we read Diary of a Spider and now were going to write our own book! We studied fiddler crabs, African dwarf frogs and millipedes! I'm writing a book with a few of my friends about fiddler crabs! It's called Diary of a Fiddler Crab. I hope it turns out to be as good as Diary of a Spider! I hope that everyone will write there own book like we are!"
1,Disgusting,"""Perverted Biggot's Guide for the Narrow-Minded"" would have been a more apt title for this book. Inaccuracies abound, not just in the cultural ""insights"", but also the pronunciation for dozens of words are incorrectly romanized. Even one star is too high a rating."
3,The Trial,"Nothing much happens but eggs, chickens, and Santa Claus, complains restless Katie Leigh Flynn about life in her small New Jersey town. But on March 1, 1932, something does happen. Something sensational and tragic. The baby son of Colonel and Mrs. Charles Lindbergh is kidnapped in nearby Hopewell.This book made me feel sad beacause Colonel and Mrs. Charles Lindbergh is was kidnapped in nearby Hopewell.I would recommend this book to people who like to read.Mayflower, AR"
4,A helping tool,"I have been trying to quit smoking it seems forever. I am on chantix but not quite ready to stop 100%, and Nic out works well with keeping that nasty tar out of the experience. I am happy with the product and wish more people would use it."
1,Useless piece of plastic,I have been using filters for the last 3 years now. This is the first time I am buying this brand and I threw them away after using 8-10 of them. It's either not filtering at all (you don't see any tar build up in the filter) or you can smoke nothing. Waste of money.
4,Very Good Product,"I've ordered several boxes a couple of times and have a friend in Colorado who's now ordering them. They always arrive within a few days. They do remove up to 90% of the tar and nicotine and I find that I don't have ""phlegm"" problems when I use these. Only con is that I've received boxes that have had the yellow filter with no white or vice versa and that if you don't stand them up once you've smoke a cigarette or two, the nicotine will run down towards the mouthpiece. Once this happens, trying to smoke another cigarette through the filter is fruitless as they taste ""nasty""."
1,Self Publishing industry,This is a self published book. After reading it I understand why the writer had to go that route. He touts an investment philosophy that was popular in the 1950s. The book is pompous and self aggrandizing. I don't recommend it.
2,"Information, but not much and not in depth","While cheaper than legal consultation, there is very little meat to this product, and certainly not enough to justify the price tag. There was no information in this DVD that I didn't already have from personal online research, which I would recommend over buying this product. If you already have an existing business, you will either know enough to not need this DVD, or will have the funds and/or need for actual legal consultation in moving online. If you are just starting a business, this will not give you enough information in any area to merit the cost. I am sure Mr. Pepper knows what he is talking about, I just wished he would have talked about a whole lot more."
5,A Must Have...,"Anyone starting a new online business of his or her own MUST buy this DVD. Mr. Pepper is very easy to understand and extremely informative in all aspects. Starting an online business can be overwhelming with all of the legalities, not to mention the technicalities of the online world, but this DVD lays it all out for you. It was a great relief to see that a product like this is available to those trying to get an online business started!!!"
5,Very helpful material,"I bought this title recently when I decided to start an online clothing business. I purchased another video guide last month from a different author, but I found it difficult to understand. I was very pleased with ""Legal Considerations for Starting an Online Business"". I found it easy to understand, well organized and very informative. The discussion about the different kinds of companies was particularly helpful in guiding me through the selection of the proper legal entity. I highly recommend this title for anyone seeking to start an online business."
2,Not Worth the Price,"Of course it is great John Denver music, but for this price I'd get Legendary John Denver (3 discs) for only two dollars more. It is a much more comprehensive collection. This is expensive only because it is an import. It contains no material one cannot find elsewhere."
3,Very good purchase,"The book arrived in very good conditions and not only earlier than the date they told me, but even earlier than I expected, about a month before the deadline, which was really good."
2,Not for a beginner,"I gave this book only 2 stars due to the fact that I found the material to be too complex for a beginner. I have no experience in programming and was hoping that the book would be more detailed in how C++ works. There are alot of examples in the book for you to copy to the computer but the commmands aren't described. For example in Chapter 2, part of the example tells you to type the following with no explanation as to what the commands are and what those commands are doing.void SetName(String *name){ strName = strName ->Copy(name); }String* GetName() { return strName; }Perhaps I had the wrong impression when I purchased this book thinking it was a C++ tutorial rather than just a software tutorial. Who knows?The plus side is that you get the book and the complete Visual C++.net software cheaper than buying the software alone."
5,Excellent Introduction to Visual C++,Ok. This book doesn?t teach C++. But it sure teaches the Visual Environment if one already knows C++. The practical teaching format is very easy to follow and the book is very complete. Excellent and easy to follow. A great introduction.
4,Just one small problem,"Yes this book has some of the best fonts online and gives websites on where to buy them.Yes this book is excellent quality, full color, excellent graphics, accurate, edited wonderfully.Yes this is a fantastic fonts book - one of the best I've seen.But... one small problem. A huge majority of these fonts come one website (lunchbox studios) which is no longer in business. I tried to buy the fonts myself. The company turned off their phone, their credit card system, etc. even though their website looks like it is up and working. So even though the fonts may LOOK good in the book... they will most likely not be available where it says."
4,Unique and Beautiful,"This is a beautiful film. So much so that I was tempted (A temptation to which I did not yield) to over-rate in an effort to mitigate the negativity.""Light Gradient"" is a film, very much ""shown"" rather than ""told' or acted out. We are left to interpret the activities, long looks, and mildly kinky games between the young lovers. It's a little voyeuristic, like being there in real time. A point ""shown"" most vividly when they end up with a mother and her son at their farm house.The stars themselves are excellent actors,and good looking but in a very average way. Which makes the contrast between our protagonists and the angelic Henri with whom both seem taken, all the more vivid. The poignancy and angst are real, even if the cause (which is open to interpretation)is imagined.There is some plot confusion, which I believe to be the fault of poor translation, but it's minor. Overall, the film is very well done, not slow, not boring, just different and visually, quite stunning."
1,A Sticky Problem,"I purchased this waffle iron after reading all the great reviews it received. I have not had problems with it falling apart. My big problem with it is that the waffles stick and split in two leaving half the waffle on the top iron and half on the bottom. For me, it has done this from day one. The only way to keep it from sticking is to spray the top and bottom irons with cooking spray each time I pour the batter. Even then I still have to use a fork to pry loose the edges to make the waffle release. I have to use a pot holder on my left hand to prevent steam burns as I partially open the iron to keep the waffle from tearing and and then pry it loose with the fork. The extra cooking spray prevents the waffle from getting crisp and makes more of a mess to clean up. I would not recommend this product."
2,Poorly Made But Makes Decent Waffles,"This waffle maker does make pretty good waffles but I can not get over how cheap it is for supposed ""Cuisinart quality"". The amazingly poorly made, loose hinge that holds the 2 parts together will not make it through the warranty period unless I baby it. I am very disappointed and would recommend looking elsewhere for a better waffle maker."
2,I do not recommend,Liked the price but this waffle maker is small and most importantly hard to handle because the outer portion gets hot. Easy to burn your hand. Also it doesn't the feature that lets you know when the waffle is ready. Suggest a buyer spend a few more dollars to get a better product which I did. Gave this one to the Thrift Shop.
1,ZERO STARS! This is dangerous!,"I was severely burned when I used this waffle iron. I thought it was a lot safer to use than it actually is. It has no safety features at all and you cannot come in contact with the outside of it when it is on or even after it has been turned off. The outside of the unit gets so intensely hot that if you accidentally touch it anywhere on its outer surface, you get a nasty blistery burn. You cannot ever allow children in the kitchen when attempting to cook waffles with this skin sizzler. Also, the instructions tell you to spread out the batter, which I did. Even when using a small amount of batter, it came gushing out the sides! Then what stayed in stuck to the grid and had to be scraped out. I used Pam and it still stuck. I experimented with all different amounts of batter on all different settings and got the same horrendous results each time. This is the worst small appliance I have ever purchased and I am surprised it has not been recalled. Stay away from this one!"
2,Not vey well made.,The dial for for how well done you want your waffel broke off the first time I cleaned it. Very cheap piece of plastic.
4,"Waffle, waffle! Who gets the waffle.","The initial maker I received had a nonfunctioning ""ready"" (green light) indicator. The maker was propmptly replaced and functions well.The maker produces and excellent waffle. The only drawback is that it only produces a single waffle at a time. For me, a single person, this doesn't cause any problem. For a family, however, a larger waffle maker would be advisable.Storage is easy due to the size and configuration. The maker stands upright. To clean the maker, a simple wipe down on the grid and a periodic cleaning on the exterior is easily accomplished. Overall, well worth the price."
4,Small but effective.,"The waffles made by this iron are small but they cook quickly and are removed easily. Clean up and storage is no problem. Cord storage could be improved, but for the sale price paid I am not complaining."
2,Disappointing Item,"The Control temperature with this item does not work, when set to medium, it burns the waffles darker than advertised.Basically have to use it manually & watch the cooking process-cannot recommend this product. Will have to spend more $$ for a better product."
1,Don't buy it! Name doesn't mean anything!,"This is the first review I've ever written on Amazon, if that tells you anything. This product is terrible! Bought for a camping trip, used about twice a year for 2 years. The doneness selector broke off!! There is not an adjustable back hinge, so if the waffle gets too big, the front opens and the steam pours out. Even if it isn't too big, the steam pours out the front, warming the handle to open the iron...not a good design! Also, if you overfill, the batter pours out the front into the slot wheree the (now broken) doneness slector is. The Cuisinart name isn't what it used to be. Don't buy it!!!!!"
2,Junk but decent waffles,"The moment I removed this from the package I considered returning it. Probably should have. It is so cheaply made that it's hard to believe. The hinge is so loose I examined it to see if it was defective but I think that's just how it is. Also, the sliding switch has a lot of play. I'll now have to think twice about Cuisinart products. The only positive is that it actually makes ok waffles. They are the kind I like, brown and crispy. We'll see how long it lasts; for $40 it's kind of disposable."
2,Cuisinart WMR-CA Waffle Maker,"This waffle maker looks good and works fair at making waffles, but has many problems. The temperature and timing numbers wear off in just a couple of months. The plastic parts broke and separated also in a couple months and had to be super glued back on. The only redeeming qualities are it makes fair waffles if you remember where to put the temperature dial. I am dissapointed that a high class company like Cuisinart makes such a poor quality product. I can not recommend this waffle maker"
2,"Makes good waffles, but doesn't last","I have been through two of these. The first one lasted 2 or 3 years. The second one didn't even make it a year. In both cases they just stopped working (no heat or lights). It's too bad, because they are cheap and make good waffles, but I learned my lesson and will buy something different this time."
2,Spend your money on a better one,I bought this waffle maker because of brand name and price.It was a big disappointment.PROS: It cooks waffles at the right temperature for the setting and they come out looking good. It does not take up counter space and has a great appearance.CONS: Waffles stick and are hard to removed without tearing up. I've tried cooking spray and cooking oil but nothing helps. The biggest problem is the smell. The burned plastic smell lingers for hours after it cools. Makes me wonder if it is in the food. The griddles cannot be removed for cleaning and are a pain to try to wash. It's on the back shelf and I am ordering a better 3-in-1 selection.
3,Broken darkness adjuster,"i have had this waffle maker for 9 months, it makes okay waffles, but the light/dark adjuster hasn't worked properly since purchase. this morning it broke completely. it still makes pretty good waffles and its a good price. but if you want a waffle maker that lasts dont buy this one."
4,Worth it.....just be patient and follow directions,"Out of the box on first use I was ready to give this 2 thumbs way down....but I've completely reversed my decision. Its exactly what you pay for and it does the job quite well. Its not built tough enough to use at a hotel breakfast buffet but serving up 4 people at the house is no problem. One helpful hint is don't pour the batter to the edges. Cover the inside 2/3's, hold the lid down with a little force (for 5-10 seconds) so the batter spreads, let go of the lid, and wait for the green light. Cleans easy.....as long as you don't spew batter out the sides. Makes great Waffles so give it a chance."
3,Very steamy and waffles stick,It makes delicious waffles. Arguably the best waffle I've ever eaten at home. The only thing I don't like is the fact that steam constantly comes out the top. You need an oven glove to open the iron. I recommend that you use cooking spray because the waffles will stick or even tear apart. The non-stick surface allows for easy cleaning but it doesn't prevent the waffles from sticking.
5,Good Waffle Iron,"Gave this as a gift to a family member. It heats up quickly, cooks just as fast, and makes great waffles."
4,Very Good Waffle Maker,"Purchased this Waffle Maker after reviewing many different models. For the price, this is a very good waffle maker. Compact design makes storage very easy. Works very well, makes a good sized waffle."
3,"good waffle maker, cheesy construction",Works like a champ but the black plastic part on the back fell off after only a few weeks. I had one previously--what doomed it was the other plastic bits breaking.
4,"Basic, easy to store, and cooks well","This waffle cooker is a great value for the money. It heats consistently, is easy to clean and takes up little room. Mine has performed well for several years."
2,the silent waffel maker,It's a good waffel maker but it needs a buzzer of some type to let you know when the waffel is done. Also the selector for how you want it cooked is a loose lever needs to be tightened up.
5,Fantastic Waffler,"Just tried the Cuisinart waffle maker and was extremely pleased with the way the waffles turned out. Actually, surprised would be a better description. Over the last 40 years I bet I've owned at least 10 different ones that never did come up to my expectations. Like a making decent waffle. My view for a decent waffle is just what it says. 1) Not burned 2) Soft inside ( as in done ) and slightly crispy on the outside 3)Easy to remove from the cooking grids (both top and bottom )4) Easy to clean and store. When it first arrived, I took it out of the box thinking, ""Oh no, this one is too small"". Don't be fooled with the looks. It is just right. I mixed up and made three waffles within 30 minutes and each one turned out great. Even my wife was impressed and that,s saying a mouthful. Great product at a reasonable price![ASIN:B00006JKZN Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker"
2,I like waffles,"At first this worked great, the red light/green light thing is a good thing, and being able to actually select how cooked you want your waffle is definatly better than having to time waffles yourself (especially when your cooking for picky people ;))Unfortunatly after 5 or 6 uses the waffles started sticking and pulling apart regardless of how much (or little) they were cooked. It got worse until the waffle stuck completly and were basicly ineatible. I tried greasing the iron, the waffles still pull apart but they're eatible."
2,Not so great,"Yes, it does make a waffle fairly quickly. But not so pretty one. I invested more $$ thinking because it is cuisinart, it'd be better. My friend has a dirt cheap waffle maker from wallmart but it makes a better waffle. Also, it said it'll be smokey when only used for the first time, but the smoke still comes out after over 5 times of use. Not so good."
1,Poor performance,"I bought this waffle iron new and have had horrible results. I varied the temperature setting and recipe numerous times, but every waffle stuck to the iron and was a disaster. I hate this model and would not recommend it. Mine is on its way to the trash can."
2,good while it lasted,It made wonderful waffles until it began sticking and impossible to clean. Very frustrating. Will not consider this model again.
1,Dont waste your money,"Used Aunt Jemimah Buttermilk pancake and waffle mix (using the waffle mix recipe on the box).After cooking 8 waffles, I have yet to get one that didnt stick to the top and bottom of the waffle maker, tearing the waffle in half upon opening. The only way to prevent this, is to set the unit on its #1 heat setting, and letting the waffle cook until steam stops coming out the sides...Then it is crunchy and almost burnt. Using PAM did not help, it has the worst non-stick surface I have ever seen...gets WAY to hot on its recommended setting, and tells you the waffle is finished at the correct time, but tears in in half when opened.I wont go into the fact that the waffles are paper thin, and the top flops around like its broken (although I do not see anything broken on the hinge.Will be returning this one, and keep on searching for something that works."
1,Disappointing product from Cuisinart,"Received this as a gift for Christmas. Waffles stuck horribly on the first use. On the second try a week or so later, the heat-control tab broke off. Then the piece that moves back and forth between the numbers slid into the waffle maker. Consistently had spill-overs both times. Feel terrible that I had to tell the gift-giver in order to return this product. Will be picking out a different waffle maker."
2,Did a good job - for a while,"We have had this waffle iron for a little over a year. It did an excellent job at first; waffles are crispy and evenly baked in just 90 seconds! However, even though we cared for it as directed, the waffles started to stick after about 8 months of use. We found that we had to spray a little oil on the iron after the first waffle, or the second one would tend to stick a little. It gradually got worse until we were oiling the plates before each waffle, and still had to coax them a little to remove them. Heaven help us if we forgot! We would have thoroughly stuck waffle on both the upper and lower plate, which was quite a challenge to clean off.We enjoy waffles on a regular basis, making 2 waffles about 3 times a month. We got 14 months of use out of this waffle iron. Just got a replacement under warranty; after paying shipping each way, it is costing me $19 to replace. When this one starts to stick, I'll look for another brand that (I hope) will last longer."
2,"Looks nice, performs poor","The first time I used this, it made pretty good waffles. Although very thin, they had a great taste. I used a setting of three and turned it down to two after the first two waffles were a little too crispy for me. The second time I started at two, the waffles were overdone so I made the remaining at setting one. The third (and final) time I started at setting one, the waffles were still overdone. Each time I used the same batter(with oil) and same amount, also tried with Pam and without. Im going to return this to the store at which I paid $35."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The overall construction seems wimpy. The slide control is very sloppy. The red/green lights might be accurate for someone else. If you open the lid after the green light comes on, you are likely to get burned by the steam. So far, because I don't drive, Amazon is convenient, but 50/50 when it comes to overall quality."
1,Broken..... 3 x Used,"Apparently (having purchased this 2/2/12) the only recourse on this is to ""review""....either that or return for reduced refund and pay the shipping to boot. So here it is...... in use the third time this morning.... the ""done light""/ and tone no longer work. So ""guess"" if the waffle is baked or it will burn. I'm thinking the return policy needs to be revisited.... someone, somewhere, should stand behind this item without additional customer costs when the item is defective."
2,"Well, it worked half of the time","I was thrilled with the idea of being able to make waffles at home, and I believe the excitement and novelty of it is what kept me satisfied with this waffle maker for the first few months despite the consistant fact that half of every batch of waffles would remain stuck to the plates and have to be pried, poked and scraped out with a fork or butter knife. However, as time went on my patience grew thinner and the percentage of botched waffles grew higher. I received this waffle maker as a christmas gift, and believe me I am not proud to say that I threw it out three weeks ago."
1,Disapointed,Product was broken in box before shipment and unabled to be operated safely and caused inconvenience because it was a giftSa
4,not as thick as I would like,"It's very easy to use but you have to remember that it doesn't come with the ready beep noise. What we end up doing is to just stay around and stare at the light, when it turns from red to green quietly we would know it's ready. The other down side is that the waffles actually came out to be quite thin. We had to fold it up to make it look nice."
1,good while it lasted,we were very happy with this product while it lasted - in less than 1 year - it stopped working !!! Now it is time to buy another one - but not this one.
5,Easy to use!,"This Waffle Maker is so easy to use. It has adjustable heat settings, so you have to play with it to figure out what is the best setting for you. But, it's very simple, and SO easy to clean. It's the perfect size for individual waffles - just like you get a breakfast buffet's, and making your own batter ensures you get just what you want. Add blueberries, cinnamon, even chocolate chips for the kids (or you!) to regular batters, and they'll come out like a professional. Defnintely recommend!"
4,Makes Waffles,"Delivers what it promises. Waffle making is not a complex science, and this is all you'll need for them to come out fine and dandy."
3,Works but I wish I had my '70s Toastmaster back,"This waffle maker does not live up to my expectations of Cuisinart products. However, it does work very well if you like limp, pale waffles. To get any crustieness at all, I set mine on 4. The recipes are good. Still wish I had my old Toastmaster back; it worked so much better."
5,Cuisinart Waffle Iron,One of the finest home appliances I have ever purchased or owned. Surely the finest waffle maker I have ever used. I cannot praise this too highly.
4,Easy to clean,"The main benefit of this waffle iron is that it is so easy to clean. The drip edge is not very large, but it is adequate to prevent spills. The exterior of the iron is smooth and free of crevices, as such, if a spill does occur it can be cleaned quickly. The interior non-stick surface is well made and does not scratch easily. This waffle iron also has a quick reheating time between waffles, saving time during long waffling sessions. Considering the low price, this iron is a great value"
1,disappointing!,"I got this waffle maker for Christmas. I got to use it a whopping four times before the plastic adjuster for browning broke off. I'm surprised that Cuisinart, which normally makes top-notch small appliances, would skimp on such a small detail; a knob might have worked better. Oh well, guess I'll be looking for another waffle iron!"
1,Waffles stick after about 5 uses; broke after 3 weeks of use,"This waffle maker works great initially and makes wonderful waffles, but like a different user has mentioned, its performance starts to decline after around 5 uses. The waffles started to stick to the lower grid and pull apart when I try to dislodge them from the grid. I've tried oiling as well and that helps some but the waffles still pull apart a bit or flake when I try to get them out.Addition: I'm changing this from a 2 star to a 1 star because the waffler broke this morning after approximately 3 weeks of use. It won't even turn on! Thank God Amazon is letting me return it! I'm going to get a Villaware 3000 Perfect Waffler instead and hopefully I'll have much better luck with it!"
1,Very poor quality,"I again replaced my old broken waffle iron(Cuisinart Round Classic Waffle) with this one thinking I was getting roughly the same iron. The quality has fallen off greatly :1. The browning controller literally fell off with my first wipe2. The plates don't have enough clearance and the waffles come out with holes. I use a very thick batter, this is a serious design flaw.3. The heating element shows thorough on the waffle i.e. there's a cook ring within the waffle - looks really stupid.This thing is not the waffle iron to buy and it's the second terrible Cuisinart waffle iron I've tried. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice............"
4,Great Waffle Iron,"I actually bought one of these for my mother, after purchasing one of my own. It is the perfect size for one person. It has a light to tell you when your waffle is ready and adjustable settings for how dark you like your waffle to be. The only thing I would say it could use, is an actual on/off switch rather than just plugging in the electrical cord to turn it on. Still, I highly reccommend this for a single person or small family."
1,handle broke pretty soon,It works fine until it breaks. The handle was held on by a tiny thin piece of plastic. Not worth it
1,Returned product,"I bought this product based on a fairly good review history but ended up returning it a week later. The waffles continually stuck to the top plate. I tried various oils and sprays with no luck. I bought this product to replace my 19 year old waffle maker, which was an Oster Designer Waffle Maker (BEST WAFFLE MAKER EVER). Unfortunately, Oster no longer makes this product. Needless to say, I will keep searching."
1,Buy this waffle iron if you want your waffles to stick to the grill,"Do not buy this puppy. As you can see it has been around for a while. I made waffles according to the receipe in the instruction book. Put the shade setting on 3 as recommended, waited for the light to go green as recommended. Waffles stuck to grill!!!!! Nothing was mentioned about spraying the waffle iron grill as it should be non stick. The waffle maker also does not have a large surface area so get enough waffle for more than one serving.You cannot remove the waffle grill surface for cleaning. Not good. My old GE waffle iron has removable grills for easy cleaning when necessary.I have an old GE waffle maker that is still making great waffles. The surface area is large enough for making two waffles about 6in x 6in. Actual size since is about 6in x 12in."
5,This product works very well,"I just can't believe why some people actualy rated this product with one star. It works very well, it doesn't stick AT ALL. Believe me, this is the good waffle maker. I will use this product forever."
2,Made good waffles when it worked,"This machine worked well for making waffles when it worked. Then, one day it just quit working. It isn't that old so I really didn't expect it to die.Now I'm in the market for a new waffle iron and I definitely don't repurchase products that die an early death. Sorry Cuisinart, but I will go with a different brand this time around. :("
1,It just up and died! DIED!,"This was a wedding gift two years ago. I've made waffles a grand total of FOUR times. The fourth time things were going great, one... two waffles, I pour the batter for the third one and BAM! The light goes out, it stops heating and it's just done. I guess two in waffle-maker-years is ancient? I let it cool down thinking maybe it overheated, but nothing worked. It went to the trash can grave yard."
3,No alarm; bad recipes; otherwise fine,"It could really use an audible alarm to let you know when it's done. It doesn't take long to burn. You have to keep an eye glued to the light.The recipes in the manual are awful. Vegetable oil instead of butter? Please.Otherwise, for the price it's pretty decent. I'm not dissatisfied, but it's not 5 stars."
2,Crispy Critter Waffles,"I have used this maker several times and on the lowest temperature setting #1 and the waffles are dark in color,crisp and have a slight burned taste. According to the instructions setting #3 is for golden brown waffles, NOT TRUE! I've been making waffles for years so I know how to operate a waffle maker. My preference is a softer, light golden brown waffle. Needless to say this item will be returned. On the plus side, easy to use, non-stick surface works great!"
3,No feedback from recipient,This was ordered as a gift and sent to the address of the recipient. It arrived on time but have not received any comments on the item itself.
2,"Great waffles, Great mess!","I owned one of these waffle irons. I loved the iron for making the waffles, perfectly timed. It created golden brown waffles every time. What I didn't like about it is the slider on the front to adjust the length of cooking. If you overpour the batter, it leaks out the front into the slider trough. The bottom of the iron sealed. It appeared I could have unscrewed the screws and cleaned it out but what a pain in the neck. It aggrevated me when the kids overfilled the iron and the batter oozed into the gizzards of the waffle iron.The iron does make great waffles and the collection of batter in the bottom didn't interfere with future batches; I just thought it was unsanitary in there."
4,Works well - Fast cooling,"Good product, works well, cooks very fast.Somewhat smaller than pictures lead you to believe, but that's my fault not theirs. Good rating."
5,Always Make Waffle For Breakfast,I'm very satisfied with this product.My family were so happy that we don't have to buy a waffle that very costly. TQ !!!!
2,poor design,"I purchased the item and was very pleased with its performance until the black plastic at the top back of the waffle iron fell off (the tabs broke). I contacted customer service and after much discussion they replaced it with a new one after I had to prove how this was a safety issue. Once again, the same exact thing happened about 1 1/2 years later. The internal wiring is exposed again. In addition, since the metal parts also get very hot when in use it is difficult to move it now because there is nowhere to grab onto it with 2 hands. Makes great waffles but falls apart with normal handling-too bad!"
5,Great product!,"Purchased this for my home so we could enjoy homemade waffles more often. This is a great little waffle maker! Makes them perfect! I especially enjoy the indicator on the front, to adjust the cooking temperature and doneness of the waffles. It makes waffle making enjoyable and fun! We have used this every other day for breakfast and it still works wonderfully! Also it is a cinch to clean! Would highly recommend to anybody looking for a nice small waffle maker!"
3,Does What It Is Supposed To,"This is not top of the line product and did not expect same, not bad and cooks fine so can not complain.Easy to use a little hot on the exterior but it is a cooking appliance.Bottom line is worth what we paid for and about what we expected from other reviews."
3,The lid will not close tight,"The waffle maker is good for the price. But, the lid will not lock to tight close and because of this you will never get a good looking waffle. You have to press down by hand with pressure to produce a good waffle."
4,"Another good waffle maker, but, ...C'mon Cuisinart!","I bought this as a gift for my mother (she asked for a waffle maker). I have a different model cuisinart waffle maker, and since they don't make that model anymore, I chose this one. She was very pleased with it. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that there was a black smudge on the lid. I'm not sure what it was. Soap and water wouldn't get it off, but rubbing alcohol did the trick. I checked the griddle plates and the rest of the waffle maker and there were no additional anomalies. I have several other cuisinart appliances and enjoy them all. I highly recommend this brand. Just an odd experience with this one. C'mon cuisinart, give some refresher training to your final inspection personnel."
2,Poor Design Vents Steam Towards Handle,"I'm returning this waffle iron. First, I was surprised that the slider button was plastic. Seems very cheap. If i use a bit of pan spray I can make waffles that do not stick, so that's ok. The highest setting 5, was not enough to make a golden brown and crispy waffle, so I give it about 1 minute extra each time.But, the worst part is the design.The steam is funneled to the front of the waffle iron - where the handle for the top lid is. I end up using a hot pad or mitt each time just to open the lid. There is NO WAY I could let my 13 year old - who loves to cook - use this waffle iron due to the poor design.The waffles are fine.And, if you are fine with using a mitt each time, go for it.But, I'll be searching for a model that vents the steam away from the user.And, I'll probably look for a more sturdy model - perhaps cast iron instead of plastic on the inside.This one is fine for the money, if you are ok with the design."
2,"Makes great waffles, inferior product attributes","I was delighted to find the waffle maker I had been looking for. . .one that was NOT a Belgian-waffle type. I have used this appliance perhaps 6 times now, loved it until today when I brushed against the temperature adjustment knob and it fell off! In the future I will have to somehow adjust the termperature with. . . what? Perhaps a toothpick? Its very shoddily made for such a great name as Cuisinart."
2,Warranty worthless,"Made good waffles, but when the adjustment knob fell off for no apparent reason and no way to repair it myself, I called Cuisinart and they said they would sent me another one for $[...] and I would have to send the other one back and pay shipping. Might as well buy another maker from another manufacturer who stands behind their product and, probably, lasts a lot longer. So I cannot recommend this iron since I am sure there are others out there which would be more reliable and do just as good a job."
4,Makes great waffles!,The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it broke after 3 years of use (and we don't make a lot of waffles). But I loved it so much that I bought the exact same one to replace it. Never have a burned waffle...just set it to the middle setting.
5,Perfect replacement!,Our family prefers the traditional waffles and this is a great replacement for our tired and worn out waffle maker.
3,Cuisinart Waffle Maker Failure,After just over a year the hinge broke through ordinary usage. Since it makes excellent waffles I bought another one but if that one fails in a short time I will not buy a third one. Since the warranty requires that I pay $10 up front for shipping and handling with no assurance Cuisinart would repair the waffle maker or send me another one I will not risk the $10.
5,Best waffle maker around,This is a really nice waffle maker. Easy to use and easy to clean. Makes great waffles too. We like our waffles crispier so we use the higher setting (5).
5,Cuisinart Round Waffe Maker,"This is the best waffle maker I've ever had. With the different levels of heat to choose from, you can have your waffles exactly the way you like them... from light to dark and crispy. The only negative is that there is no off switch, so you have to unplug the waffle maker to turn it off completely."
2,M.S. Bailey,"I ordered this waffle maker as a replacement for a different brand that had not held up very well. We have waffles every Saturday morning--family of 8. The waffles baked quickly and were perfectly browned. After two weeks the slide control broke off. Amazon.com was great to send a replacement, especially since Cuisinart charges almost $11.00 for handling a warranty issue. Again, we really like the waffles. But the baking control is definitely cheaply made and does not look as though it will hold up. We will see. The control issue is the only reason for not giving the product ""high 5!"""
1,Returned It - TWICE!,"Based on positive reviews, I bought this waffle maker. The first thing I noticed was how cheap the adjustable setting slider was. Cheap and plastic. It's so loose, I couldn't even tell which setting it was on. Cooking was inconsistent as a result of this design flaw. After a few weeks, the slider broke.I exchanged it for another of the same model. This new one had the same design flaw. In addition, the new one kept burning waffles. I returned it, too.I will look for a different waffle maker."
2,Cooks great but has disintegrated,"Have used this for 4 years about once a week. Cooks fine, ready light is great, but the darn thing has simply fallen apart. It began 2 years in with the handle falling off and as of this week, lid will not open."
5,COMPLETELY SATISFIED,"I recently purchase this waffle maker from Amazon,and am completely satisfied with it. Have had NOproblems with the waffles sticking to the grill eventho I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews after ordering. I use the highest number 5 setting since I like my waffles brown, and the high heat setting gets the grill really hot which is what you need to help keep the waffles from sticking. Just be sure and always add the recommended oil amount since this is what makes it a waffle instead of a pancake and ensures no sticking. I even use cornmeal mix to make cornbread waffles, and just made some today using just cornmeal mix, hot water, and oil. Perfect!!"
3,its ok. does its job,"i reas many reviews on this and other waffle makers. I decided I might beat the odds. this waffle maker did not get the best reviews. It was okay. the first waffle got stuck and I had to peel it off piece by piece (I had not used spray-even though instructions said it was not necessary). the second waffle came out better. there is problems with overflow-but if you use less it does not cover the whole grid. I finally got it right (sort of). browning is great. timing is perfect. The description stated that the top was heavy so there would be no'lifting'. well, the batter did push up on the lid everytime. I chose cuisinart because of the name and the price was good. I should have spent more and purchased a belgium waffle maker instead. I settled and although I am not completely disappointed, I am neither quite thrilled. it is just there. so if you need one, yeah the price is right. but if you're really excited, and have always wanted one-pick another!"
1,Waffle Iron,"This is the worst excuse for a waffle iron I have ever seen. I tried three times to make waffles in it and each time the batter stuck so that I had to unplug the iron and let it cool to release the waffle. Needless to say they were unedible, burned to a crisp. I packed it up and am returning it ASAP.Its not worth rating!!! Too bad you don't have half a star, even that's too much."
3,Handle fell off in less than 3 months,"Overall this is a good waffle maker for the price. With typical waffle batter, you need to leave it on high, and let time go past the time the green light goes on. Somewhat cheaply made. Handle for slide fell off (lost) in 3 months, so we now need to do the slide by inserting a kitchen utensil. Still trying to get replacement from Amazon or Cuisinart. Glue it on with super glue as soon as you purchase!!"
3,waffle maker,Not as solid as I expected it to be. Seems to work okay though. I have used other cuisinart products and was happy with them.
1,Junk,"The heat control knob has lots of play, resulting in only 4 heat settings out of the 5, and never quite knowing which setting you're actually on. The construction is flimsy and the hinge appears ready to snap when the appliance is open."
2,Cuisinart WMR-CA Round Classic Waffle Maker,Don't like it that much. Hard to clean and also hard to take the waffle off when it is ready.
2,Did Not Last,"This was a great little waffle maker. Easy to clean, waffles came out easily without sticking. Browning control setting seemed to be accurate. But then the browning control slide broke. Very cheap plastic part broke inside the slot, so there is no way to fix this. Very sad to say that this was only after 10-12 uses. I would stay away from any Cuisinart unit that uses this slide control."
3,Acceptable but not terrific.,"Bakes an acceptable small round waffle. Materials and workmanship are mediocre, for example the 'brown-ness' control has about 3/4 inch of play. The waffle iron was purchased for the 'small hole' waffle style and does have small holes, however, the waffles are very thin. Thicker waffles with the small holes would have been nice. Usable for people who like their waffles on the thinner side."
1,Browning handle is made to fail,"We used this about six times before the browning button fell off. I popped open the back cover to see if I could fix it but this little knob was attached to a plastic part that just fell apart when I touched it. The plastic was just too thin and brittle. It was made to fail. I won't buy another Cuisinart, they used to stand for high quality but they get all their stuff from China now."
2,Poor quality control for Cuisinart,"I cannot comment on how well this waffle maker might work because I never plugged it in. The temperature control slider was very loose. It might be a poor quality component or it might be that it is not properly fastened inside the unit. If it is a poor quality component it probably won't last long. If it isn't properly fastened there is an electric shock danger. Either way, I sent it back."
4,gift for family member,bought this as a gift for a family member who specifically requested this product because she was so pleased with the previous one.
1,Total Junk,"I've used mine twice. I have yet to get an edible waffle from it. Every waffle tears to shreds when I try to remove it. Instead of non-stick, they ought to call it maximum stick."
3,Pancho406,We bought this one less than one year ago and it worked OK at first. Now the bottom plate has stopped heating. We expected more from Cuisinart.
2,Tried it...,I bought this waffle iron a couple of weeks ago and I'm not very happy with it for the following reasons. It browns waffles very unevenly. It doesn't have a large enough reservoir for overflow so if you accidentally overfill the iron at all the batter ends up on the waffle maker and on the counter. The waffles tend to stick to the top part of the iron even though the iron is new and supposedly nonstick. I'm already looking for a new waffle iron and wish I had kept the receipt for this one.
4,A Bargain,"Works fine, no guesswork. lets you know when the waffles are done. I would recommend this product. M M M"
4,Reliable and made well!,Makes a great waffle....cooks quickly and evenly. Non-stick works well. This is my second one. First one I had for 10 years.
4,Easy clean up,It heats up quickly. It cleans easily. I just don't like round waffles as much as I like square ones. I will just have to adjust my taste because I am keeping this one. Good deal for the price.
2,"Works pretty well for a while, but didn't last very long","This waffle maker worked pretty well for about 18 months, during which we used it about once or twice a month. The waffle pockets are not very deep (about a quarter of an inch), and the thermostat setting has a lot of play, which makes it fairly inaccurate, but for the waffle recipe we use (Alton Brown's awesome Luft-Waffle recipe), we just left it at the lowest setting and the waffles were done perfectly after about 1.5 minutes. However, the non-stick surface started pealing in a few small spots and eventually the thermostat broke, overheating the waffle iron to the point where the non-stick just came of in flakes, at which point we threw it out."
5,Joan,This waffle maker is the greatest waffle maker I have ever owned. It doesn't stick at all. No non-stick spray needed at all. It is great!
2,Horrible!,"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because it worked the first couple of times. The waffles were good and my family enjoyed them. Then the waffles started sticking to the top of the iron. I would put a ton of oil on it making sure it would NOT stick and then...it would stick. So then I would have to go back and scrape the waffle from it, where it would turn then into crumbs. The pièce de résistance was when the waffle maker would not open! The green light was on and it had been enough time to cook- and the iron would not budge. It was only after 10 minutes that it finally did open with a very charred waffle inside. I thought Cuisinart had good products-wow, was I ever wrong. Avoid this waffle iron at all costs!!"
3,smaller than I thought,I was mildly disappointed in receiving this as it was smaller than I expected. It works great - just takes two runs to make waffles for two.
3,Returning it,"The temperature control is cheap and flimsy (I doubt that it even does anything). As others mentioned here, when the batter spills out it gets into the switch and into the giant groove. Not a good design.Waffles come out good, but it doesn't cook very evenly. If you're looking for the kind of waffle maker that will cook the perfect crispy consistently golden waffle, and will last more than 6 months, this aint the one."
2,Look for another brand,"Got this waffel maker and it worked great for about 30 days until I went to clean it up. The temperature control broke off with little effort. Upon opening it up to see what part broke and get a replacement, I found that the part broken was a real delicate plastic part, easily broken. The Cuisinart web site offer no replacement parts and an email to customer relations remains unanswered. Now I have a $30 piece of metal and plastic with no temperature control. Look elsewhere for another manufacturer."
1,Not A happy camper,"I recently received this waffle maker as a Christmas gift and I must say this is the worse product Cuisinart has ever made. I own so many products made by Cuisinart that I was excited when I opened this waffle maker. I used this product the very next morning to make my family breakfast. My first attempt was disastrous the batter came out of the sides and was very difficult to clean. My second attempt was the same,this time the batter spilled over the front right into the slide button. Waffles stuck to the top. After numerous attempts the waffles still stuck. The design of this product was not well thought out. Needless to say I returned the waffle maker and got another thinking this one was a lemon. Nope, the second one worked as lousy as the first. I would not recommend this Cuisinart waffle maker at all."
3,"gift... seems nice, very functional",I haven't used it since I bought it as a gift. I hope some of the plastic parts are sturdy enough to hold up well. It is a very compact size.
2,Works pretty well... until it doesn't,"This waffle iron was turning out very good waffles... golden, crispy, everything I was looking for. No problems with sticking or cleanup at all. But at the end of my SECOND time using this thing, it DROPPED DEAD. No lights come on at all. I tried waiting for it to cool down, then plugged it back in. Nothing. The only thing I can think of is that I had the 'darkness' meter turned all the way to the max (5+) during the whole process of making about 10 waffles, and this thing couldn't take the heat. I'm going to try to get a replacement, and be much 'gentler' on the next one!"
3,Cusinart WMR=CA Round Classic Waffle Maker,"The waffle iron does not get very hot, not enough to really cook the waffles. A little disappointed in this item."
4,"Great Waffles, Mediocre Hinge","Im not sure if my model is defective but the hinge is failing after 1 use, but i am giving it the benefit of the doubt because it makes superb waffles.These thin waffles are what I find at Spires Restraunt down the street but mine are now better."
5,Thankfully not Belgium,"Rugged well built, good temperature control, round design helps in even temperature distribution, thin compact (easy to hide in cabinet)I am not sure when the Belgium waffle became the standard but it is not my favorite. I like the thin crisp waffle this unit makes. I have a Belgium waffle maker, one of them Flip designs, it takes up an incredible amount of cabinet space 3 times what this one does. And unfortunately its been in the cabinet scene first use."
2,Not hot enough,"This machine doesn't get hot enough to create truly crisp waffles. Using an infrared thermometer, I read the surface temperature to be only about 400 degrees Fahrenheit on the highest setting. My 20 year old Toastmaster reaches almost 600 degrees when I select ""dark"". These waffles come out much crisper and darker than those from the Cuisinart."
1,Nonstick? ha!,"Waffles stuck to the surfaces from day one. (Was using gluten-free flours so figured it might be the flours but from other reviews, sounds like that's not the case). Impossible to clean the inside. Handles get very hot - can't touch without using padding. After about 20 uses, the handle loosened (first one screw then the other) and finally just came off. No way to fix it and need to trash it. Shame considering I spent [a fair amount of money] thinking I was getting a quality product. Don't waste your money..."
2,Too bad Cuisinart put their name on this.,I am very dissapointed in this waffle iron. I too gave Cuisinart the benifit after reading the reviews and purchased this. The hinges are very loose. It sticks very badly. If you spray Pam on the iron for each waffle the Pam works ok. The temp control is very loose and you have to wait about a minute after the light changes to take them out. Even then they will not be all brown and they are full of holes. I have to wonder if in the past this model wasn't Chinese junk but now it is not a good buy in my opinion. I would much prefer a little higher price for something of a higher quality. It is too bad that Cuisinart has gone to inferior products from China. This is my only bad purchase from Amazon.
2,That it works is all the good I can say about it,"Please don't misunderstand. This product does work. Watch how much batter you put into it, though, as it will expand and leak over the side and force the top and bottom apart (as there's no form of latch on this thing.) There's also no on and off switch that I can find... I literally have to plug it in and unplug it to use. The hinge separating the top and bottom wiggles clumsily as well, and the no-stick surface required quite a long time for me to scrape and wash afterwards, as it stuck on the very first use.It works, and is inexpensive... so I guess this is just an example of getting what you pay for... in this case, not a lot."
2,Too many design flaws,"My main problem with this waffle maker is that if you have a batter overflow (which is a common problem since it seems to be very easy to put either too much or too little in this waffle maker) then it overflows into the crevice with the dial and then is impossible to clean. I think the ""heart"" waffle maker from Cusinart would probably fix this problem since the dial is on the top."
3,basic waffle iron,"This is a lightweight waffle iron that does just an OK job. Its main limitation is that the ""irons"" aren't that thick, so the waffles reveal where the circular heating element is by browning that part of the waffle quicker than the rest. It cooks the whole waffle, but not an even brown."
3,Just ok,I thought this waffle maker was just ok you have to wait for it to get super hot even in the indicator lights says it's ready it isnt untill the unit is super super hot...so i gave it three stars for that
5,Waffles made easy!,"Picked this up at the PX in PR for around $10. Makes perfect waffles. If you are looking for a waffle maker, this is it!"
4,I love round waffles.,This is the second Cuisinart waffle iron and I enjoyed the first one I know I will enjoy this one. The only problem I found with my first iron was the lid had become loose after time of being stood up on its black handle. I would recommend not to stand it up but place it flat on a shelf.
4,It's ok,"Dosen't remind me of the old days waffle maker like i was hoping but is supposed to be like the old days but really not. The old days ones were thinner, i like thinner waffles."
5,Great Waffles,Extremely easy to use. Waffles are cooked just right and are ready to eat in no time. Would recommend this unit to friends.
2,"Poor control knob, me too","Waffles are every Sunday night tradition. Well over 30 years. Used this model for about 5 years until knob fell off, connection melted. Delighted when new one came 3 months ago. After a week the lever ""waffled"" between 3 numbers. I usually try to set a highest 5. At 5, waffles were medium at best.Town wide power line problems led me to blame low voltage, but persists.Now green/red cycles at least 4 times while I wait for steam to cease. At first ""done"" signal batter is still runny. I will take apart and see if I can override, or toss it.Reading other comments seems I am hardly alone. SHAME on Cusinart. I love their coffee maker and deep fry."
2,A major problem,I bought this waffle iron 2 years ago. There is now a major problem: the non-stick material is flaking off and adhering to the waffles. I will have to discard the appliance because it is now unsafe to use. I purchased the item through Amazon.Irwin K. Rosenberg
2,Not a happy customer,After several uses the lever controlling the darkness of the waffle simply fell out.Not worth the price for the quality. Didn't contact anybody as I don't feel I have to spend my time training businesses on their product. I simply don't use that manufacturer again.
4,Great waffles but it takes a while,"If flavor is important to you (it is to me) this is a wonderful iron. The waffles come out very crispy & perfectly golden. The first waffle is as nicely browned as the last one.My only complaint is the time it takes to bake a waffle takes a while if you have a large crowd to feed. The bottom line, you will love this waffle iron if you are cooking for two. For much more than two, opt for the larger model."
2,Overflows a mess!,"I ordered this waffle maker to replace an ancient Black & Decker Hearts machine. This machine makes good waffles, but it overflows very easily. If you fill it correctly with batter using the recipes provided (as well as others I have tried), it does not fill in the dimples of the waffle on the top after cooking. If you add enough extra batter to fill in the incomplete upper dimples, then it overflows. I am accustomed to waffle batter overflow, but what makes this one so frustrating is the spewed out batter invariably runs into the temperature control slide! They should have relocated the control elsewhere or added a barrier for the batter to be diverted around such."
2,Uneven browning,"I thought buying a waffle maker with the Cuisinart name on it would be a safe bet, but this has been a disappointment. I used the recipe for basic waffles from the manual. I didn't have any problems with sticking (brushed the plates with oil with a pastry brush before using) but the red/green light mechanism seems to be inaccurate. Waffles came out with uneven browning and not light & crispy like I prefer them. Like other reviewers have said, the steam also gets vented toward the handle so use an oven mitt if you are going to be making a lot of waffles."
4,Excellent!,"Simple, well designed waffle iron. Definately has the Cuisinart quality, get it on sale and be happy.My only quibble is cleaning the thing. The drips over the sides come right off, but getting oil off the iron part is aggravating. The plates don't come off to wash.But it's teflon- and it gets hot enough to sanitize itself. It's designed to be clean, so I've rolled with it and been happy. I just quit with the squirt of oil, and it just stays clean enough. I recommend it. Better than 98% of waffle irons.The waffles come out perfect, perfect heat and even distribution."
4,So far so good!,"This is my first waffle maker so I can't compare with others.Sometimes when you open it, it will stick to the top.It tasted good and kids love it although it is not alwaysperfect round.I always used setting 3.I used a wet paper towel to clean it."
1,A disappointment,"I don't make waffles very often, so I wasn't looking at buying something super-expensive for only occasional use. The price seemed like a good value, and the reviews were mostly positive. However, this waffle iron had enough design issues that I returned it after the first use.Pros: efficient space-saving design, easy to storeCons: rear hinge does not expand up, so when the waffle expands during cooking it opens the front of the waffle maker, venting the steam directly onto the handle, and making the waffles cook unevenly. At first I thought I was putting too much batter on the iron, but after several creative batter-pouring and spreading attempts I continued to have the same problem. Uneven cooking, steam burns on my hand when I tried to open the maker, and shoddy construction that allows the top plate to wiggle significantly from side to side when moving the unit were enough to convince me it was not worth the money or the headache."
4,Purchased as a gift because I liked mine so well.,I received my own Cuisinart Classic Waffle Maker for Christmas 2008. I like it so well that I purchased one to give as a gift on Christmas 2009. I like how I can choose to make my waffles a little crispier if I desire. I make a full recipe and put the extras in the freezer so that I can pop them in the toaster at another time. I am very happy with this product.
3,"Good waffle iron, storage is a plus, but no audible ready alarm","This is a good waffle iron. It's best features are the round, nonstick surface and heavy weight. Also, being able to store it on it's end saves much space. It's worst feature is that it lacks an audible ready alarm. It simply has a light that changes from red to green. I definitely would prefer the alarm and will ensure that my next waffle iron has one."
5,Perfect Waffles,This is the best waffle maker that I have ever owned. It makes perfect waffles every time. It never sticks and is so easy to clean up. I am getting ready to purchase another one for a gift.
5,GREAT NON-STICK WAFFLER,"I GOT THIS ON SALE IN A DEPT STORE. OTHER REVIEWERS SAY NOT TO USE A PANCAKE MIX. I USED AUNT JEMIMA COMPLETE PANCAKE MIX BECAUSE THERE IS A RECIPE FOR WAFFLES. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THE ADDED OIL. I TRIED IT AND THE WAFFLES TURNED OUT FINE. MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT DRIPPING FROM THE SIDE DIDN'T ADD OIL AND THE MIX WAS TOO WATERY. I OILED IT BEFORE FIRST USE AND USED PAM AFTER THAT FOR EACH 1/2 CUP OF MIXTURE. I USED THE 3&4 SETTING AND BOTH TURNED OUT FINE. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH SPILLAGE OR STICKING. REMOVED THEM WITH RUBBER SPATULA. MY SON TASTED THEM AND LIKE THEM WITHOUT EVEN PUTTING ON SYRUP! I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO EXPERIMENTING WITH OTHER MIXES AND RECIPES(MINI CHOCOLATE CHIPS, YUM). FOR NOW THE AUNT JEMINA PANCAKE AND WAFFLE COMPLETE MIX WILL DO SINCE I HAVE 2 BIG BOXES TO USE. DON'T THINK I WILL BE MAKING TOO MANY PANCAKES NOW. CLEAN UP IS EASY WITH A PAPER TOWEL BUT I ALSO USED A Q-TIP TO CLEAN IN BETWEEN."
2,Not as great as the reviews...,"I bought this because of the great reviews and especially because several people said the waffles were crispy, well, they are....for about 30 seconds and then they get soft....unless you put them in the toaster....which isn't very convenient if you're wanting to eat them. It does seem to be well built and store nicely though."
5,Great waffle maker; minimal price,"We bought this as a starter waffle maker since we had never made them before. As a novice, me and my husband picked out a recipe from the food network. We followed the directions on the maker to the dot and got instant perfect waffles every time. The only downside is that I wished i bought a Belgium waffle maker.Also, for a more crisp setting we go to 5; 4 is or a mid crips level and anything lower will give you a mushy pancake feel."
4,Read Into the Story,"I was at a Convention (let's not get into that) where Misty read parts of these stories to her fans. While many on this Review board seem to find her recent stories ""not Up to her Standard"" I found them Extremely entertaining and I cannot wait until I can afford the next ones. The reason I find these books entertaining is because of Double Entendre. That is all I will say, Look up the word if you have to and read the stories again"
3,Getting tired of this...,"Misty is starting to get YA!! I read her books originally because it was Adult. What bugs me about YA is that the plots in general are not as developed and there is not alot of action. but this book and Owlflight will do not a lot of good for new readers but if you're an avid Lackey reader you'll enjoy this. I was missing some of the older characters but I'm glad that there are some of them in here, even though I really would have like to have Elspeth and Darkwind in here. This book was Ok, but not really great. I think it has something to do with Larry Dixon--whenever Lackey works with him she doesn't write as well. I hope she will get better with the plot development cuz most of your readers are getting tired of this lacking of plot thing."
1,Even worse than the first,"(See my review of Owlflight for a more detailed overall gripe about the series.)This time around we follow the tale of Keisha, the healer of Errold's Grove. Once again, a stock character in a stock tale---this one made even worse by even *more* tedious pointless rambling than there was in the first book (which at least had the crutch of an actual plot to help alleviate the tedium).However, this story's biggest flaw lies in its failure to exploit the most interesting characters---the Hawkbrothers. Once again, we've got a good chance to see their daily life, and it's simply glossed over. A possible enriching facet which *could* have been used to make the Hawkbrothers more well-rounded and interesting---their mild xenophobia toward outsiders---was mentioned, then simply ignored.This is the last Lackey series I'll be reading. Period."
3,not too much altogether...,"Although I have always loved Lackey books, I must say this book is a little dull. Unlike her other works, this series doesn't have a true villian to spice things up a bit. And the ending.... it was too perfect, too unrealistic to be good. I personally find it stupid. Lately, Lackey seems to have lost her touch with her books."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I, like many other fans reviewing this book, have also read all of ML's books and this was definitely a bad one. It was BORING and juvenille. What is going on? How about a little action and characters who aren't made of sugar..."
5,Wonderful!,"Owlsight was an excellent follow-up to Owlflight. The characters were well fleshed out, and the story line was wonderful. I do wish we could get away from barbarians, though."
3,Not the best Lackey work out there...,"I love all the Heralds of Valdemar series and although the Owlflight series is fun, it didn't quite capture my attention like Arrows or the Last Herald-Mage trilogy. I would suggest reading those to appreciate Ms Lackey's talent."
2,YAWN!,"Now, don't get me wrong, I love most of her books but this one was just so TEDIOUS! Nothing happens! Most of the storyline could have been condensed down to a few chapters, instead alot of emptiness has been made to fit a several hundred page novel. I certainly hope the final book in the series has a little more plot and action going on. Very disappointing."
4,Definitely the highlight of the series...,"Owlsight may not live up to the expectations set by the Last Herald-Mage or the Arrows of the Queen, but it was definitely the highlight of the series. Darian has grown up a bit, and there's a lot of good character development. I also found the storyline a little more interesting than those of Owlflight and Owlknight. Overall, I liked it, but if I re-read it I'll probably read it as a stand-alone rather than part of the trilogy."
3,a nice read - but not up to Misty's standards,"OwlSight is a good story as far as it goes, but it doesn't measure up to the standards set by Misty's previous books. The portrayel of the characters seen in OwlFlight were good, and stayed fairly true to form. However, I was dissappointed with the manner in which some of the ""older"" characters from previous books were portrayed. It seems to me that they lacked their usual character. Misty also needs to write longer books (they keep getting shorter and shorter) with more content and depth. Overall I'd say read it if you're a Valdemar fan, but I wouldn't rate it as highly as some of her other work."
2,Not up to the Lackey Standard I'm used to expecting,"Although this book was a pleasant read-thats about all it was. We saw gradual, even paced character development with few surprises. We saw even less ""action"" or other situation conflict. It plodded along, seeming predictable at times. Mercedes Lackey is among my favorite authors and I did enjoy the first book in this trilogy but I do not plan on buying the third book. I was disappointed with this book but would encourage new readers to give her other books a try."
4,not as good as the first book in the series,"owlsight is a continuation of the story of Darien who is now eighteen years old. Misty has done an awsome job as usual, and I can hardly wait for the last book in the trilogy;Owlknight, to come out."
4,I Liked it,"It's been a while since I've read any of the Valdamere series, but overall I must say that I really enjoyed the two books in the Owl Triology and can't wait to read the third.Instead of seeing Valdamere through a completely Valdameran preception, you get to see it through the Hawkbrothers' society in the form of an young boy raised and trained by the Tyledras. Hey after all, not everyone is meant to be a herald, and not all adventures need be cataclysmic! Personally I liked the different angle on the story. Hmmm, I wonder if she is going to have another series soon? I hope so, I really enjoy being surprised and delighted. :)"
3,"Well written characterization, slow-moving plot","Although one of Misty's trademarks is good characterization and _Owlsight_ is no exception, I found the plot lacking. Too many pages(3/4 of the book)were devoted to char description without advancing the plot much. Characterization is all good and well, but at least she should have interwined it with more action.If you are an avid fan of Valdemar and you do not care much for fast-paced action, then I would recommend this book, especially since a number of earlier characters reappear--Firesong, Kerowyn, Eldan. You also learn what many of the characters featured in the Magestorm Trilogy are up to. It really is a good story, but a little too slow for my tastes."
1,Product Quality Poor,"I was excited to purchase this particular lamp. I bought a similar lamp years ago from Bay Furniture and loved it, however I gave it away when I changed furniture. I was excited to see this lamp and purchased it. When it was shipped I did not open it for a couple of months (waiting for new furniture to be delieverd). The blubs were broken, (that was ok I went out and bought bulbs). However, where the lamp arched it was broken and could not be repaired. Unfortunately, my husband was so frustrated he threw it in the trash before I got home for work. Therefore, of course I couldn't return it. I would not recommend purchasing this Arc lamp."
1,Gay-pride soapbox,"The author brings nothing new to Turing scholarship, relying heavily on long quotations from other authors who understand their subject. He misunderstands Turing (repeatedly claiming that Turing did not understand the implications of his own paper on Computable Numbers) and Godel (claiming that Godel had proven mathematics inconsistent). The few mathematical expressions that appear in the book invariably contain misprints. The frequency of occurrence of the word ""homosexual"" and the relentless implication that Turing's life revolved around sex is insulting to Turing's genius. Such innuendo is more suitable for the dark corners of a gay-pride magazine, rather than a volume in the Great Discoveries series."
1,Impenetrable,"As one who had been a fan of David Leavitt's previous work, I approached this book with certain expectations. Yes it was non-fiction etc. But I found it completely unreadable. Perhaps I should have just skipped over the turgid mathematical sections...but I was unable to without a sense that something essential would be lost...and yet those sections were Impenetrable. Unless you are a mathematician, I would suggest passing over this book in silence..."
4,Sad ending to a great genius,This book gives a clear and accessible account of the life and the mathematical achievements of Alan Turing and his contributions to the development of cryptanalysis and the modern computer. Turing apparently committed suicide in the early 1950's because the British authorities were hounding him about his homosexuality. He was a man ahead of his time in one too many ways!
1,Not worth the price,"I bought this with the idea of using it while watching TV, reading and to provide relief when my back muscles tense up.Pros:- The heating and massage functions provide good relief for tense muscles.Cons:- The positional locks aren't good. They don't lock easily and unlock if you shift in your seat.- The metal support bar on the back digs into your back, through the cushion, if you sit in a reclined position.- If you are shorter than 5' 9"", you will most likely feel a pinch under your knees and reduced blood circulation, in the reclined position.- Does not provide good lumbar support; do not use if you have a bad back and need good back support."
1,NO SHOW,"DID NOT RECEIVE ITEM, IT WAS BACKORDERED. I RECEIVED ONE E-MAIL SAYING I COULD CANCEL OR WAIT, THEN NOTHING ELSE. AFTER A MONTH, I CANCELLED THE ORDER AND ORDER FROM ANOTHER COMPANY."
5,A Man Alone,"""The strongest man in the world is he who stands alone.""Henrik Ibsen, An Enemy of the People, 1882This story is about one man toward the end of the Vietnam War, whose task was to blow up a bridge so the enemy would have a hard time getting to the south. John Walter Ripley was up to the task.Read the book. It can be read in an hour.Certainly Ripley calls to mind Gilliatt, the hero of Victor Hugo's ""Toilers of the Sea""."
1,not suitable for mountain lions,"My pet mountain lion named spanker ""speedfeet"" Johnson coldn't find out how to record songs. When my pet chimpanzee tried to help they both got electracuted and died. The chimpanzee was oh so sweet and ill miss him dearly. When I get my bear you guys better watch out. or else! Just kidding"
2,Not what expected,"I expected this to work like a regular microphone, but the only time I could hear my own voice is when I used the playback button. My son threw the ""microphone"" down when he sang into it and couldn't hear himself."
4,From the mom of a singer,"My daughter enjoys it - and so do I! You should no have to keep holding down the blue button to record. However, ours did not work correctly when we first got it, but all I had to do was change the batteries."
3,disappointed,"My three year old got quite frustrated with the recording mechanism. Also, when you do try to record, a voice comes on and there is a delay that interferes with recording. The applause and clapping is quite annoying. If the manufacturer cut the bells and whistles and simply let the kids record their own voices this would be a much better toy. The sound quality of the recorded songs is poor. The toy isn't intuitive or well designed. Thankfully there is one setting that allows kids to sing what they want. I'm sure there are much better products on the market for this. I would not recommend this toy and see little educational value in it (between PBS and singing to my children they learned their ABCs much earlier than they would have played with this toy anyway)."
1,Disappointed by this book,"This book is definitely not aimed at beginning Hebrew. Not only does the author assume the reader is familiar with the Hebrew alphabet, but also alreadty knows many works (well over 100). The explanations of masculine/feminine words, conjugating verbs, word order, etc., are minimal. I found that I had to call a fluent Hebrew speaking friend to help me with this ""beginner level"" text."
4,Hebrew one review,"This workbook is good for learning Hebrew, but ONLY if you already know the aleph. If you plan on purchasing this book to learn Hebrew, you must take an introductory course first, or purchase a Hebrew primer. Otherwise, you will be lost as the author of this book assumes you have a rudimentary or better understanding of Hebrew."
4,the most pedagogically astute work in Hebrew instruction!,"Ora Band and Bella Bergman have shattered the rules of Hebrew instruction with this ground breaking work. The ""Shelabim,"" in the vernacular, works with all sides of the brain to ensure total absorption of grammar, language and usage. One can use this text for young and older adults, teens and younger kids with equal ease. Students will come away from this work really having learned something. I used this text on a college level, and the students learned a great deal without feeling they had overly exerted themselves. this is a measure of how finely attuned this work is to the way people actually think."
5,An entertaining way to start learning Hebrew (again)!,"I was Bar Mitzvah 37 years ago and had not studied since then. I wanted to be able to speak Hebrew, and to understand the Siddur. Studying with a tutor and using this book was a terrific start. It is entertaining and warm. While you learn, the stories in each unit will heighten your mood. Then you can go ahead to Level 2, and it get's better.I doubt that there is any better way to learn Hebrew for one who vaguely remembered the aleph-bet."
5,great book on C++,"I think this book is the best I ever read on C++, it addressed the complex concept in a easy way,the exaples in this book is easy to follwoing. After read this book, I feel to write a C++ program is not so difficult as before."
2,bad formatting,"While the information in the book is good, the publisher ruined it by not preserving the spaces in the code! The code is unreadable!"
3,Disappointing,"I have purchased quite a few DK Readers books for my kids. We love them. This one, for some reason, has failed to grab their attention. I barely made it half way through before the kids started to suggest that I read other books.This book starts with the jealousy and conflicts among the Greek gods (which, the story goes, led to the Trojan war). About a third of the way through, one finally gets to the war outside Troy. In contrast, the real dramatic part of the Trojan war--the horse (named in the title) comes across as a rather minor point in the story. Which is a shame given that the Trojan horse most likely is more intriguing to young readers than the jealousy and power struggle among some Greek gods that the kids have not quite got a grip on.Aside from lacking focus in this short book (and packing in way too much loose details on Greek gods), the book sounds rather dry. Perhaps all Level 4 books are like this one, but we are a bit disappointed."
2,There are better books out there,"I chose not to use this in our study of Greece. It had a very cluttered feel to it - you had the story and illustrations to go with it, and then pictures of actual items from ancient Greece around the borders. Visually very distracting.The story of the Trojan war is not pretty. This version has Hercules dragging Hector's body behind his chariot in a very off-hand, non-emotional kind of way. I felt like this wasn't appropriate for my 7-year-olds and especially not with a ""oh well, things happen"" kind of attitude. There was no real 'feeling' in this book and I think the story needs it to work.I used Trojan Horse by Emily Little this year. It's a brief overview without getting too in-depth or too gruesome. I'll use Rosemary Sutcliff's Black Ships Before Troy and The Wanderings of Odysseus the next time around when they're older and can handle the blood and guts and discuss the morality of the choices made with more clarity."
1,Wish I had found the previous review!,"I had almost the exact same experience, only it was only rain. But everything was soaked. I followed the instructions, and while the hold downs, extra velcro straps and cinching allow you to really tighten the bag down so you don't have any flapping, if it really was weatherproof as Rola claims, it would be a wonderful product."
1,EVERYTHING GOT SOAKED,"I am not a happy camper. Loaded up my roof top bag on Sunday afternoon, nice dry day. Cinched it down nice and tight, made sure all my flaps were overlapped as shown in poor instruction manual. About an hour into my trip we were in a snow storm, about 4 hours into the trip we were in rain. Arrived at my destination Monday evening, unloaded my luggage and low and behold everything is soaking wet. My luggage is probably ruined. I would rate this a zero or negative if that option was available. Thanks amazon for the FALSE ADVERTISING."
4,"600mile drive, wind no problem, rain a problem","Drove from Delaware to New Hampshire. Secured easily to roof rack and never shifted or needed to be tightened during transit. Barely any wind noise. Held a decent amount of items. The problem was with rain. We hit moderate rain a few times, nothing heavy. All zippers were closed, all velcro secured that held down the protective flap over the zippers. Somehow water still got into the bag and one of the bags inside had completely saturated clothing upon arrival in new hampshire. Overall happy but still needs waterproofing work."
5,Worked wonderfully!!,"Looked around at many different sites and saw that this bag was the right size for our Traverse. The only thing we were afraid of was if the bag would fit the dimensions of our luggage rack, so we ordered it and immediately tried it out. Worked like a charm! We went through snow an sleet and nothing was wet when we arrived in California. But we did buy extra 12ft straps for extra tie down and the plastic clips are weak in the colder weather but nothing that the extra straps cannot handle! Great product for the price and it works!! But you have to read the WHOLE instruction manual and follow it!!!!"
2,Not great,"I have had my Cruisinart WMB4a waffle maker for 2 months, used it 5 times. After the third time the latch popped off while cooking a waffle, this has become an everytime annoyance. Too late to return to Amazon (over 30 days) and Cruisinart will not supply a simple part to repair it, they want me to send it back to them and pay postage both ways. I will not buy another Cruisinart product."
4,wonderful!!,"We have had this waffle maker for about a month and we love it! It heats fast than I can make the batter! Makes waffles quickly, which is perfect for a family of four. YES it is pricey but well worth it.This product makes four belgian waffle at once, is nonstick. You should wipe the inside with oil before each use to make sure nothing sticks. It is 1500 watts and gets very hot. Word of warning if you have an older electrical system make sure you dont have to much plugged in at the same time. I have blown the fuse a couple of times. There are two lights one(red) that shows it is on and a second(green) when hot. The green light goes off when you add batter and comes back on when done.Just one note: this was the first time I made waffles and it took a little time to learn the timeing and such."
4,Good basis for NEW catholics..,"A previous review says this book is confusing and misleading..from a community of three priests and two nuns who use thisbook with those in preparation of RCIA and entering the Catholic faith,, we think it gives a beginner Catholic a updatedand informative view of our Catholic beliefs..DAS,Upstate NY"
1,"Confusing Content, Poor Writing","This is not a survey of Catholic belief or practice, as the title states. It is a collection of conflicting concepts with occasional but important misstatements of fact about the Catholic faith. The author misrepresents Vatican II and represents anti-Catholic beliefs as ""Catholic"". The writing is not what is expected for a book that has been used as a text for ""general readers and college undergraduates"". Phrases like ""negative vibes"" probably don't mean much to the student audience, and the use of ""some"" for articles such as ""a"" or ""the"" is an awkward habit. If you want to know what Church dissenters teach, read Curran or McCormick. If you want to know what the Church teaches read Hahn, Howard, Guardini, Newman, von Balthasar, Groeschel or a multitude of others. If you want to confuse and mislead a friend, give him this book."
4,good starter,"I ordered this book series for my five year old daughter who had brought one of the books home from the school library. She found that the large text, short words were easy to read, and the illustrations kept her intersted. This series of books are great for a beginning reader."
5,Cute series!,I bought these books for my two year old son whose name is David. He giggles every time I read his name in the books.
1,disappointing,This book was disappointing to say the least. It doesn't have a lot of substance and I am very surprised about all the great reviews. Maybe I'm missing something? Maybe the book is just for the pictures? But the pictures are not even that great. Maybe I should get into the children's books business.
1,Scary images for children,"We received 3 ""diaper David"" books as a gift for our child and all of them are filled with terrifying images. The pictures are scary and the writing/story is stupid. I do not recommend this author at all."
1,dumbest book ever,dumbest book ever. you have to explain the picture to the kids. there is no moral teaching around not doing bad things. wish i never bought this book!
1,"Poorly drawn, no fun","there are so many better board books out there; you should spend your money on a good one. the drawings in this book are rough and a little scary looking, and there isn't really a story to get involved in."
3,"Ok, but there are better . . .","My daughter isn't too into this book. She'll sit and read it, but if given a choice she'll choose another - like ""David, Smells"". I'm also concerned that this book with give her bad ideas, such as refusing to eat, as David does in this book. . ."
2,Just replaced this with an Onkyo,"This reciever was fine for a while but then I lost the dolby processing, the center channel started dropping out, and I only got full surround sound through the coaxial input. I like Sony, but sound doesn't seem to be something that they do well at. *shrugs*I've read some other reviews for other Sony receivers that said there were problems with channels dropping out. I don't know what is causing the issue, but on mine I can wiggle the wire to get it back. *shrugs again*"
2,Very disappointed,"I've been buying SONY products for 30 years and I've never been as disappointed as I am with this product of theirs.Besides the fact that I have yet to figure out why the speakers cut-out periodically... (SONY says I probably need to send it back to be checked) I think this receiver is overly complex and hard to use. Almost nothing about it, except the basic controls, seem to be intuitive. If I could send it back for a refund I would."
5,A seminal contribution with emphasis on the practical,"The collaborative work of clinical psychologist Steven Taylor (Department of Psychiatry, University of British Columbia, Canada) and professor of psychiatry Gordon Asmundson (Research Director, Faculty of Kinesiology and Health Studies, University of Regina, Canada), Treating Health Anxiety: A Cognitive-Behavioral Approach is a solid, in-depth resource focusing especially on helping those people for whom fears of contracting a serious illness cause excessive, serious, and chronic problems with day-to-day life. Reviewing current knowledge about health anxiety disorders, stressing the need for continuing collaboration between Cognitive-Behavioral practitioners and primary care physicians, outlining recent advances in the treatment of health anxieties, and much more, Treating Health Anxiety is a seminal contribution with emphasis on the practical and a welcome contribution to mental health reference shelves."
2,Most interesting...,This book shows step by step how to's on the traditional Tibetan relegious purification exercises. Also it explains things about how to connect within yourself. Definitely something to look into for someone seeking more energy and vitality and love for life.
1,So the recommendation center isn't perfect...,"Very rarely do I actively dislike a book. This was one of those times when I did. Yes, it's a sci-fi detective story. That's good. Yes, the premise is interesting. That's good. But the characters were *so* one-dimensional, the plot was *so* predictable, and the concepts were *so* glossed-over, that I found myself very pleased to get through it at all. Amazon.com's recommendation center has never steered me so wrong before, but I guess there's always a first time. When I finally slogged my way through it, I donated it to a homeless shelter. And now I feel guilty about it -- homeless people don't deserve dreck like this..."
1,Same thing better price,You can get this exact same product at walmart for $349.00 Save yourself some serious cash and check it out.It comes with all of the same features and at a seriously lower price.
3,fair but not right out the box,"This beer kegorator does work well but not right out of the box. so if you do not have time to tweek it I am not sure which way to go. there were dents all over the outside, the beer line was not long enough to clear the foam. because of the non cooled tower you must be ready to pour the first ounce into a spare glass then pour the real beer."
2,"Lousy Fit & Finish, High Price","For what boils down to a mini-fridge the kegerator is priced way too high. The one I received had a crooked door. All of the metal is rusted after two years, don't believe any stainless claims."
1,very dissapointed!,"I ordered this for my husband's Christmas gift. It arrived on Christmas Eve absolutely destroyed! We think it fell of a forklift. I sent it back for a replacement, only to get that one severely damaged on the top. The packaging is not nearly enough to protect such a large shipment. Finally got a refund and bought one locally after negotiating an internet price."
5,Yea Beer,"I have had this fridge for 4 years now and love it. Fit 1/2 kegs fine with the bottle in it. I recently started homebrewing and I was able to replace the 2.5 inch tower with a 3.5 tower with 3 facuts and stainless draw lines. I have to remove the top and cut the hole in to the fridge bigger, was fairly easy. You can fit 3 5 gallons kegs with the co2 bottle into the fridge, many you cannot. I had to only replace the lines once(i was to lazy to clean them). Nothing better for the price that I got it at 4 years ago."
4,Sanyo Beer Cooler,"The first unit I received was damaged in shipping. It took about a week or so for the vendor to arrange picking up the damaged unit. Once the damaged cooler arrived at warehouse, another unit was sent. This one arrived intact and works well. About the only shortcoming is that the instructions are a little short on details. For example, the beer faucet has several parts/pieces that need assembly, but there are no detailed instructions on how to do this. I did what was intuitively obvious, which appeared to work. Other that that, I'm enjoying the cold contents this item dispenses."
2,"Pretty good, but is leaking after a couple of months","Pretty good - easy to use (included instructions are lacking, however) was working fine for a couple of months, but now it seems to run all of the time, and I am getting water all over the bottom of the inside. I checked for leaks but couldn't find any. The seals seem to be fine as well. It also seems to get very hot in the back. When I was checking that out I noticed some taped down styrofoam on the top inside - was this supposed to be removed? Nothing was mentioned in the instructions. Anyone else have this issue?"
1,damage,"unit came on time box looked in great condition i was wrong .i had read reviews about packageing and since everyone like the unit i decided to order it anyway bad move was dented, metal twisted,. knob broken off.none of it was amazons fault .its all on sanyo poorest packageing i have ever seen may be great unit but not worth it"
1,diappointing piece of junk!!!,If you could rate customer service with negitive rating i would. read reviews and thought this was the one. It worked great for 6 day and it quit cooling. I contacted Sanyo Customer Relations and they were not very helpful. They said they did not have a authorized service technican in my area and would send my info to the field office. I have not had any contact from anyone. I would encourage everyone to not buy this item unless you check for warranty authorized tech in your area. DO NOT BUY SANYO!!!!!
5,One of a kind,"What a phenomenal summary of the world... Who else can condense Napoleon or the Crusades in one page or less? Really informative, especially for a history-idiot like myself. This book ignited a passion for me to read more about history! As an author, I wish I could write something as laconic and succinct!Dr. Justine Leewww.drjustinelee.com"
4,Entertaining read,"Nice little book that can be read a little at a time. However, I am puzzled that two major events, the Inquistion and Black Plague, are hardly mentioned."
3,"Succinct History, but Pretty Gauzy","A quick, nearly pocket-sized history of the world. Clearly intended for children, but I enjoyed getting a refresher. I rate it three stars considering its uneven treatment of some pretty important facts (lots on Napoleon, but no mention of the Black Death of the 14th cen.?), and its need of a healthy dose of editing."
5,used in history class,I used this book in a history methods class. We had to rewrite the chapters using the methods we learned in the class. It was a lot of fun. Gombrich explains history in his book in simple language for young readers; it was also fun to read it from an adult's point of view. This book is a good starting point for anyone interested in learning history.
3,"Easy to listen to, but extremely inaccurate","The audio version reads like a bedtime story, although it soon gets into subjects that would probably bore 99% of children. However, this style along with the brevity, make it very easy for adults to listen to, say during long commutes in a car. HOWEVER, it is extremely inaccurate! Most Americans will be rather shocked to learn that Benjamin Franklin lead the American Revolution, that the North was the weaker of the warring parties in the Civil War, that we have a Parliament instead of a Congress, and that Wilson conned the Germans into accepting the Treaty of Versailles (although the reader apologizes for this last huge guffaw). There appear to be a similar magnitude of errors in the history of other countries, but I'm not as familiar with non-American history (why I got the book in the first place). While its good that this will keep you listening, its bad that you will be hearing many false statements."
5,Brief and Concise,"What a marvellous discovery this slim volume is. We recommend it to all our friends. The author covers most world events in depth. His style is concise and well thought out. I wish that I could meet him but he is no longer living. Now I must explore his books of art. In reading fine books, one begins a chain---which is what pleasurable reading is all about."
4,Gift for a 12 yr old nephew,My nephew is a history buff and likes to read. He has told me this is the best book of overall history he has.
5,An island of gentle sweetness in sea of harsh rancor,"Ralph Cosham performs a superb reading of E. H. Gombrich's world history for children. His gentle voice and respectful tone are a perfect match for E. H. Gombrich's splendid and charming retelling of history. Gombrich never forgets who his intended readers are--children and young adults--and how he must engage them and not leave them behind. At the same time, he never patronizes his readers. A lesser reader could have spoiled author's efforts by overlaying the wrong tone or sensibility--such as, history is meant to be endued, not enjoyed; the student should be left anxious and guilt ridden, never astounded and enthralled by the best story ever told.This is the perfect spoken book for long rides in a car or for long walks. I love every minute of it and I will hunt down other reading by Cosham."
4,Historical Primer,"'A Little History of the World' is exactly what the title indicates. Gombrich takes the reader from the dawn of time to the mid-twentieth century. Gombrich covers cave men, great religious leaders, philosophers, and events over an incredible timeline.I got this book for my eight year old son and I to read together. There were certain chapters and topics which grapped his attention. Other chapters were a little over his head in regards to understanding the causes for certain events. In particular, the chapters covering the Inquisition and the causes that lead to the French Revolution were a little difficult for him to truely understand.This book is a great way to introduce a child to the wonderful stories that make up the world we live in. It may also be a stepping stone to further reading on subjects that spark some interest."
5,Fantastic,"I would recommend this book to children and adults alike.Wonderfully written, as light as one could make a book about the history of the world. The author knows just when to change up the context to keep the reader interested. I would highly recommend this book. Loved it!"
