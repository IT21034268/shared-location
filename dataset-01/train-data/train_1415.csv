1,"Look out Sauron, here's New Line Cinema","Well... I'm not surprised. And from a business standpoint I may even understand this...No!Not this time. I'm sick of this nonsense. I'm tired of people squeezing my wallet for every last worthless dollar they can. Especially now. I implore all of you that are considering buying this, please, exercise some restraint and maybe, hopefully, the massive investment these clowns have planned on fancy cardboard displays, ads and not to mention blu-ray discs, will prove fruitless.Stop being greedy jerks. This is one of the highest grossing franchises in history. Stop insulting us with the product you figure will make you an undeserved profit and give us the product YOU KNOW we want. And with the extra time you have on your hands why don't you produce a film someone wants to actually watch?"
1,To add salt into the wound,"Like everyone else I am stunned by the greed of the studio. Like everyone else I have already bought the set twice and would have been caught out yet again, save for the diligence of contributors to this site.These are the same studios bleating and whining about downloaded movies why take out their frustration on those of us honest enough to pay for our entertainment?Now even more absurd, over 17,000 people have found the lead 1* review helpful, so surely that is 17,000 x $60 of revenue - now that shows just how stupid the studio is.2-13-2011 Update: This set is selling new on UK amazon (from Amazon) for 16.93 or $27 at todays exchange rates - its regional code means it won't play on US blu-ray players - I really hope they are loosing money on this."
1,Loved the Movie - Hate Being Hosed,They could have included both versions in the Blu-ray release. If people are not interested in the extended they could have decided which they wanted to buy. There is no way that I am going to buy this.
1,Not fair for the loyal fans,"I am by no means a huge fan of LOTR, nor have i bought every edition released. But for them to actually think they could release the theatrical version on dvd, then the extended on dvd and just repeat the process in bluray is kind of an outrage. They deserve whats due for a great product, but this is just going to rip off those who love the movies the most. Not just that, i have a feeling that these bluray copies of the movie will be more pirated than anything else for a while due to the fact that it isnt the full package."
1,"This PRODUCT is a total, sensless rip-off","This movie, as a movie, is decent - great special effect, acting, costumes, storytelling, although it literally rapes the original story in several, non-trivial points.As a PRODUCT, however, it is not worth our money, as the extended edition was already available and there is nothing short of a marketing ploy to not release that in Blu-Ray.Shame!"
1,I Follow the Advice of Others,"Up front, I have not seen this Blu-ray edition. However, when 84% of more than 3,700 reviews rate this product only a single star, I would be a fool not to heed the advice.To those whose thought this would be a big money maker... when this many people tell you you're drunk - LIE DOWN! You want me to put down money for this type of product, make sure BOTH versions are on it!!"
1,RIP OFF!,"Why would I pay for this version now, and buy the EE version again later? Come on, please stop trying to rip consumers off!!!"
1,Must NOT Buy!,"I love these movies, and am willing to spend a ridiculous amount of money on them but I will NOT purchase these movies on Blu-ray unless they are the extended versions. So NewLine/Wingnut, if you want my money, you better get on it."
1,"Agree with the ""rip-off"" idea","I have to agree with the idea that the studio is ripping off the consumer. I absolutely loved the movies and bought the theatrical then the extended releases. As eager as I am to have these in Blu-ray, I will have to fight the impulse to buy this release knowing that the extended release will surely come out probably shortly before The Hobbit is released in 2011. It is sad that the studio would not do what is right for the consumer (What a concept that would be!) Granted, they have every right to release their movies the way they want."
1,Waiting for extended version,I already own the extended version in standard definition DVD. I am going to wait for the extended version on Blu-ray instead of buying the theatrical edition.
1,Where is the extended version?,I own a set of extended version of regualer DVD. I am happy to watch it by blue ray DVD but I am not foolish enough to buy it twice again.
1,Theatrical Release! What BS!!,There is only one true version of the LOTR trilogy and that is the extended edition! Until the extended edition is released on Blu-ray I will continue to watch the trilogy only on DVD.
1,First Time Reviewer - Boo!,"I have always enjoyed the benefits of the many reviews on Amazon.com. It has become my ""go to"" site to determine whether a product is good enough to get my money. Still, in all these years I have never written a review myself, until today.This box set is a disgusting money grab. It makes me angry just thinking about it. The extended version should be a part of the package and I REFUSE to buy this. I will also tell every LOTR fan I know to be wary and not buy it. I feel for the thousands of people who will be suckered into buying this and end up disappointed and $60-$90 lighter in their wallet.BOO!"
1,Both Theatrical and Extended versions should be made available at the same time!,"I can understand the original rush to get the theatrical dvd released after these movies were made and the subsequent extended version needed additional production time. BUT there is no reason for the dual releases or at least the delayed release of the extended version on blu-ray. I hope everyone piles on this negative feedback for this activity and more importantly, I hope the industry listens!"
1,Friggin' IDIOTS,"I second the majority opinion. People who are going to pay for the Blu-Ray of The Lord of the Rings, are generally the kind of people who want the extended edition. I can't believe they expect us to wait one to three years to get the extended edition in Blu-Ray format. I won't be buying the theatrical version."
1,Please do not buy this edition...,"As many others have pointed out, we need to force the studio to put the Extended Edition as well as this theatrical version on one set of Blu-Rays. Do not condone the ""double-dipping"" mentality by purchasing this movie twice.The movies were 5-star, this product is 1-star."
1,Theatrical?,"New Line could have saved a bunch of money and made a ton if they just released the extended versions with a program on the disc allowing the theatrical to be played as well.Sorry New Line I'm saving my money for the extended editions, that is if I care next year after waiting."
1,MAJOR RIP-OFF,MARKETING HYPE IMPLIED EXTENDED VERSION. DONT GET SHAFTED LIKE MY FAMILY DID... WAIT FOR WHAT WE ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR .... BLU-RAY EXT VERSION...
1,I'm pass for Extended edition,"I'm not going to be fooled into buying this and then have the Extended edition come out next year.. or worse, this Christmas. I got stuck with the theatrical edition DVDs because I wasn't willing to rebuy the movie when they released the Extended editions, I've waited this long, I can wait again! Besides, the trilogy is always on cable, so it's not like I haven't seen the Extended edition a few times."
1,WAIT FOR EXTENDED !!!,DONT WASTE YOU MONEY !!!OR BETTER DONT GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THEM!!! WAIT FOR EXTENDED !!
1,Blatant Money Grab,"This is a money grab. Do the right thing: do NOT purchase these versions. This company has already made their monies off the originals and extended on dvd.Who is responsible for this mess?New Line, are you listening?"
1,Where are the extended versions?,You have got to be kidding. This attempt to double dip fans is appalling. Release the extended versions.
1,NEW LINE SHOULD RELEASE BOTH VERSIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY,"This is a rip-off because:They are asking 66$ for the theatrical versions only.They don't announce when the extended versions will come out, therefore people are urged to buy this now, instead of waiting an indefinite period of time to experience LOTR in HD."
1,"No EE, no buy. Smarten up, New Line.","How can New Line think that we will pay all this money for a set of barebones theatrical versions of these films when most of us already have the Extended Editions on DVD with an embarrassment of riches in the way of extras. Give us the Extended and Theatrical versions in the same set and we'll all buy it. But as for this insult, you can keep it, New Line."
1,A quick Cash Grab,Another Quick cash grab from a Hollywood Studio. Allthough they didn't make the movie Wolverine that just came out it reeks of the same idealogy of praying on the fan boys as they will buy anything they sell with the LOTR Name. I for one will not buy this edition. I doubt I will buy the Blu Ray extended edition when it comes out three months later.
1,"We're not stupid, I for one am not falling for it again","We are all aware that there are both theatrical editions and extended editions(the way it's meant to be experienced) being that the DVD versions have come and gone and most of us bought the theatrical version and the extended versions not knowing back then what we know now. This is corporate greed at it's finest, and frankly it's a huge lack of respect towards the consumers assuming that we're lack the intelligence to fall for this trick again.If you're a fanboy, then sure go ahead give this 5 stars, waste your money on both versions yet again. With the way most peoples finances are we dont all have money to throw away, again this is corporate greed at its finest.I'm a huge fan of the books and the films, but I'll save my money for the extended versions."
1,This release is rediculous,"I will NOT be buying this release. Its a joke and rather insulting. Like many others, i will not be tricked into buying this version, just because its on blu-ray. Ill be waiting for the final release of the extended cut.I was seriously mad when i saw the extended cuts weren't being released. Anyone with any common sense won't waste their money on this. My dvds will work just fine for the time being."
1,"""Extended"" Profits for New Line Cinema","As a purchaser of the extended cut of LOTR trilogy on DVD format, I find it completely ridiculous that New Line Cinema. This will only hurt their already shaky reputation in terms of release dates on blu-ray. It is obviously a calculated decision which will ""extend"" their profits on the franchise a few more years into the future. Shameful behavior, New Line Cinema, shameful."
1,Way to Upset your fanbase...,"If this is released to lacking sales numbers and the mass media reports on it ... hahaha. Give the fans what they want, the extended edition released right along side the theatrical edition. The high def format has been around for over 2 years, so its obvious the high def transfer started quite some time ago.Aside from lackluster reviews by all media outlets when this is released, I hope you all can look forward to perhaps a few rotten apples lobbed at the marketing department's front door.ATTN New Line Marketing: Unless you data showing otherwide, the average LOTR buyer is a lot more savvy than the base of Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2. They understand how this works and will not purchase this edition. Instead they're just going to raise cain on message boards.By releasing this first without the extended edition right around the corner you're seriously upsetting your fanbase...just wanted you to know...unless thats something you really wanted to do.Good Luck,"
1,Wait And Buy Extended-Cut! Customers Are Wise to Wait if You Can.,"It is sad that some customers will buy this not knowing it isn't the extended cut. Many of these purchases will likely become returned Christmas presents. Customers have already been through this disappointment with DVD-formats. I bought theatrical release and then extended-cut release. It was painful to the pocket then, I don't plan to repeat that on the Blu-ray-format.Don't get me wrong; these movies are some of my favorites made. Thank you, Peter Jackson and Cast! Shame on them for not offering Extended-Cut Blu-ray as first Blu-ray release."
1,Will wait for the extened release!,I will not buy this unless they release the extended version. My DVD version will do just fine till they get their act in gear!
1,Please be aware!!!,"For those that think this is Peter Jackson's attempt at more money, check wikipedia and see how much money he has. What this is, is an underhanded attempt by New Line Cinema to dupe people into buying these movies twice AGAIN!!! They are doing exactly what they did with the dvd releases. After this has been out for a little over a year or so, they will release it again as the extended box set. Please do you best to influence the studio by not buying this, spreading the word, and writing your own 1 star review."
1,Blatant Ripoff By Warner Bros. Home Video,"There is absolutely no way that I would purchase The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy on Blu-Ray unless it included BOTH the theatrical and extended cuts of each film. In addition, all supplemental materials from BOTH the theatrical and extended standard DVD sets should be included on one definitive Blu-ray set given the massive amounts of data that can be stored on a single Blu-ray disc.I implore anyone who is a fan of this trilogy to take a stand with me and others against greedy movie studios like Warner Bros. who routinely try to make loyal fans by multiple copies of their favorite films. Is it not enough that we moviegoers and DVD buyers have lined the pockets of these greedy jerks with billions of our hard earned dollars? The only way to stop this slimy double-dipping practice is to open our mouths and close our wallets."
1,"Nope, not buying this!","Like the DVD's before this, I did not buy the theatrical release once I knew extended versions were in the works. Now, if New Line saw fit to include both versions on the same disk via seamless branching, this would be a must-buy, but as it sits now, I still have my EE dvd's to tide me over until the EE hits Blu-Ray in Nov."
1,I know the economy is bad....but come on...,"I will not buy until the extended version is released, which, as mentioned before, SHOULD have BOTH extended and theatrical cuts. I'm voting with my dollars...you should do the same. Fell for this trick in the past but not going to let it happen again. For shame...Unfortunately I received this as a gift. I took it back and got store credit towards something else. There is NO REASON that the regular and extended versions can not fit on one disc. This is one LOTR product that I will not waste my hard-earned $$$'s on."
1,Shameless double dipping,"I've been waiting to get a blu-ray player for many reasons. Mostly it is because I am waiting for my favorite films--LOTR and Star Wars--to be released on blu-ray. The *real* version of LOTR has yet to be released, thus I haven't bought a blu-ray player. This is shameless double-dipping from New Line. The theatrical and extended versions could easily fit on a blu-ray disc. That is the point of blu-ray!!!!! More space on the disc = more video!!! If they had released the extended versions, I would have bought them and a blu-ray player on day one. In addition, I might have bought more New Line films on blu-ray by now too. Instead, New Line has chosen to alienate me as a customer and not receive any income from me (not that they need it). Their loss, not mine. I'm still happy with my extended cuts on DVD."
1,It's not what the fans want,seriously!!!! we went through having to buy it over and over again with the first release. Give it to the fans in the format they want it. Extremely disappointed that I have to wait to buy now.
2,Waiting for extended! Got me last time but not again!,Big fan of the movies but not going to get suckered again! I'll wait until it's the complete package thanks.
5,Great LOTR set.,"If you love or even like LOTR, you'll like this even more. If you're a serious LOTR fan, throw your old movies away and order this today. Hours and hours and hours of LOTR special features, Tolkien back ground info, and more scenes, making more sense of things.It's pretty much a necessity for LOTR fans."
2,Disk full of problems.,"disk skips 2 times in the movies 1 on each side and you miss a whole chapter.! their is 2 sides, it sucks having to stop the movie get up and switch sides."
2,A Disappointment,"This 6 DVD set of ""Lord of The Rings"" is nothing new, if you have any versions you have what is in this set! The two or three features added are not worth the price. For me, a big Tolken fan, there is no better version than the extended edition. Once you have seen that one, it's hard to see the theatrical version and the extended version should have been released on Blu-ray. No doubt, I expect to see it soon! Wait, buy that version, it's two extra hours divided by three movies, fifty minutes alone of ""Return of the King"" and it is outstanding!"
1,What's the point?,There is no point to buying this. Wait for the extended version. OR if you have a standard DVD version play it in your blu ray and the upconversion will look beautiful. This will should work fine until the extended versions are released.
1,There they go again!!!,Lord of the rings on blu-ray theatrical versions.Wait for the extended versions of the films.It is a shame they have to release the films in theatrical versions then after a period of time finally release the extended versions.As the other reviews have stated blu-ray could hold both versions of the same film on one disc and have lots of room to spare.Make a statement and wait for the extended versions!!!
1,Will not buy,"I waited and bought the extended edition of the DVD, bad enough I feel the need to upgrade to BR, but to make me wait is even worse. And Avatar is trying the same thing. Stop screwing around just to try ripping people off."
1,Taking the double dip trip again... UGHHH! EXTENDED PLEASE!,"I did it last time around, but not this time, no way, no how!!! If Peter Jackson and company are going to make a final whiz bang ultimate super deluxe platinum special edition... fine! I'll bite then, but not now. This is really a slap in the face of the fan base that supported this entire escapade with unparalleled enthusiasm devotion. If this release falls short of expectations by the studios, then they can only blame themselves for this rather knuckle headed decision. I'll take a look at a rental and just see if all the hoopla is justified, but I won't buy one.Check my other reviews, I'm not a complainer. Just pretty miffed on this."
1,Please New Line listen to what the customer wants!!!!,"Like everyone else here that has given this product a 1 star, I wanted to add mine to keep the tally going up. I would think that New Line would get the idea that people are tired of this kind of scam to rip off the consumer. I will admit that I did buy both theatrical and extended versions on dvd, only because I liked the movie so much that I couldn't wait for the extended version, But I will not do it this time. I hope that they loose money on this release to teach them that the consumer will not tolerate this any longer!!!! Please keep these 1 star reviews going maybe ( I doubt it) it will get them to see reason."
1,Once Bitten Twice Shy,Ain't gonna spend any money buying short version of any films released this way by majors when we know there's a long version. It's really a total disrespect for both the public and the film makers. Feel like buying a brand new car with missing wheels! Went to see the movies at the theater then bought the 3 regular version on DVD then bought the 3 extended version on DVD again. Once bitten twice shy...
1,Seriously?,"Are these guys really doing this to us AGAIN? I must still be foolishly idealistic, because the depth of their greed and duplicity (in attempting to trick people who perhaps aren't paying attention into buying the series in Bluray twice) astounds me."
1,Movie studio displays Gollum-like greed.,"Many LOTR fans were burned a few years ago when they rushed to buy the theatrical versions on DVD, only to see the extended versions offered a short time later. Don't get burned again by greedy movie studio execs. I'm hoping that pre-sales will be so dismal that they decide to relent and replace this with the version that fans deserve."
1,This is a slap in the face for fans,"I cannot believe that the studio is really going to release only the theatrical release when a blu-ray edition finally shows up! I already had to wait an extra year for each of the extended editions, and now I am going to have to wait again to get LotR on Blu-ray?Note to the heartless beancounter who thought they could pull the theatrical release/extended edition stunt a second time: Just because no one is buying this release does not mean that no one will buy the extended editions, it just means that we know that you could fit it but you just wanted to try and milk us for more money. We aren't buying it!"
1,No stars for no extended blu ray,what is the point of releasing different versions this late in the game? Just release and theatrical/extended version in one package. if you want to release a limited number of special editions then fine but don't trickle them out to try and pump the consumer for more money.zero stars for the pathetic release of this version of the film- yes i already own the standard dvd plus the extended versions on dvd but would like to buy a worth while blu ray for once and not waste my money.
1,where is the extended version,"the extended and theatrical should appear on the same release if possible, atleast release them both at the same time and respect the consumers who are awaiting the extended, blatant profiteering."
1,Got screwed the first time around...this time I'm waiting.,"I don't care how many people say the studios made it clear there would be extended versions of the DVDs, I heard nothing about it until I'd already bought the first film and the SECOND movie was coming out. There is no reason to wait that long to release an alternate version, accept to dupe every penny out of a fan-base that you can.Sure, it's good they offer both versions...some folks want the theatrical cuts (apparently, they are even Peter Jackson's favored versions). And this time, at least they are making some effort to MENTION that extended versions are coming. I still think this is a good way of bringing attention to the fact that New Line has made enough money from people being uninformed of their choices."
1,I eant the full version.....,"I going to wait for the full version in Blu Ray. The people who create this version are crazy, Why did they do Theatrical Editions instead of full version?????"
1,Epic Fail by the studio,"Great movies, but don't support this BS - wait for the full version of these movies and rent the ""theatrical version"" if you need an HD fix."
1,Won't get duped again...,"I was expecting something like this from George Lucas, but this really is beyond bad taste. Loved the LOTR trilogy, and loved the extended editions as well. W/ blu-ray technology, they could've managed to fit both versions of the films on disc. I will wait for the special editions. For trying to gouge my wallet, one star is all you get!"
1,LOTR holds back,Don't buy this Blu-Ray. The studio is holding back the extended version from us. Its a rip off!
1,Lessons learned,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.Not only will I not buy this, I will tell everyone I know not to buy it for me as a gift, don't buy it for themselves, don't buy it for their other friends...To the studio I say: Give me the extended editions or give yourselves a warehouse full of paperweights. Your choice."
1,How about they milk it some more?,"Shameless money grubbing. Chalk me up as another that will boycott this item despite the fact that the movies are INCREDIBLE. Just give us the extended editions in HD! It's not like we haven't waited long enough.The best part is that they don't even have to do any further editing or re-mastering to release these in high-definition. The original mastered footage is already higher-resolution than Blu-ray provides, and simply gets down-sampled for DVD release. All they have to do to release 1080p Blu-ray copies is press a button."
1,Ho-Ho-Hold Off the Purchase,The studios have once again shown that they have nothing but contempt for intelligence of the public. Set aside the fact that we confirm their belief on a daily basis in other ways... Why anyone would buy the theatrical version when we know that the Extended Version's going to be released at some point is beyond my comprehension.Our patience is stronger than their greed.Lord of the Rings is fantastic but I will wait for the Extended Blu-Ray version.
1,"No Branching, No Buy","No choice of branching between theatrical and extended edition, no buy. As simple as that. We waited for years for the Blu-ray so to argue that the DVDs were coming out as theatrical versions first and extended later is a misunderstanding at least. Also, to say that some buyer would prefer theatrical version ignores the fact that Blu-ray is capable of storing both versions of the movie on the same disc for consumers to choose which version they like."
5,The Cheapest Way-- to Have it All.,"I just bought this today, although, through rental, I've managed to see the extended editions many, many times over the course of the past two years. I've also accumulated used versions of the widescreen editions of the trilogy but really, especially, if you've waited this long, the widescreen editions are a waste of time. The boxed sets, with their premium documentaries, are the way to go. You get the benefit of possessing all the extra and extended scenes. The container box isn't bad either as I'll be placing mine atop the fake fireplace. The packaging for the box set is sedate and conservative which is appropriate for what its cardboard contains. Peter Jackson's works are the Rolls Royce of film and this set commemorates them forever."
1,"Be Reasonable New Line, No one's going to buy this set!","The only thing I can say for New Line is to stop being a money grubber and release the Extended Editions at the same time so people can choose which one they want, don't force anyone to buy anything. You did it twice before and earned heck of money out of this. We're not going to be fooled again, sorry."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A SCAM!!,We all know the extended version is coming next so to buy this especially if you bought the dvd version and then they released the dvd extended version and now this > ?? really?? so your saying that when this is all done i will own 4 releases of this movie...i dont think so.SAY NO TO CORPORATE GREED.
3,they love your money,"I have bought the LOTR series now twice over on DVD... got the theatrical cuts when they came out, then the extended cuts when they came out also.. I really don't want to buy this series two more times... I think it's very shady of new line to try and milk the fans of money by doing the same thing with the blu-ray releases when they could very easily just release the extended cuts from the get-go.. or combine both in one huge fan pack. Seems all they care about is the all mighty buck.. and not treating the fans well, the people they depend on for that all mighty buck."
1,We want HD quality and Content,I still watch the VHS copies of my most beloved films. Blu Ray doesn't have large enough library or appeal for me to upgrade yet. Where is the innovation? I'll be waiting.
3,on the fence,"I'm very doubtful that anyone will read this review. I love the LOTR movies. I will not be purchasing this set as I am sure that the extended releases will not be far behind. However, I cannot write hateful statements about the company releasing this edition. I think it is a good package for those who might not have the time or feel the need to watch the extended versions which in some cases have been extended for almost an hour. I think it is a so-so move. My question is why didn't they package the extended version with the theatrical? They did it with the last release of dvd's. I'm sure the blue rays could handle it."
1,BOYCOTT - THE ONLY ANSWER,"There is only one way to stop this, and future greed attempts by the studios. BOYCOTT. I know it will be difficult, but think this way, let New Line manufacture and ship millions of these Blu-rays. WE ignore them, leave them in the bins. Let the reviews read - ""biggest flop of the season"" Retailers will want to return them to make room for titles that sell. New Line will either spend money to take them back, or give up large discounts to the retailers to drop prices. Either way, it costs New Line $$$$MILLIONS. They issue the extended cuts, we buy, it hits # 1 on the sales charts - and EVERY other studio prone to double dipping notices.It's up to us. it's called WILLPOWER - and it's the only tool we have. Let's use it"
1,Insulting.,"I'm sure the studio could make the excuse that some customers will not want to see the extended version, and will prefer the theatrical version. I absolutely agree -- most of the time when I see a movie, I want to buy the version I saw, rather than the 'uncensored' cut. If that is the case, then provide both versions simultaneously so that customers can choose, rather than trying to strong-arm hardcore fans. It's insulting."
1,A rip off item,I can't believe that we get an extended edition of King Kong but not of Peter Jackson's masterpiece: The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. This is as I see it an attempt form Warner Brothers to rip off money from me twice. What they do not about branching the two versions? have them call Universal so they could tell them. I am a big fan of the movies but unless they release the extended versions branched in I will continue to watch my DVDs. Shame on this company for trying to make people double pay for the same item.The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray]
1,1 WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED VERSION!!!,your wasting you money to buy this. Wait till the extended versions come out. They are just trying to rip you off. Do not buy!!
1,$$$,"They just want to make more money.. and they will, because not everyone wants to wait for the extended edition. As for me, I am not going to buy the theatrical version even if it would mean waiting for a decade."
1,Hollywood Corporate Scam,"I too fell for the ruse when LOTR came out, I immediately bought the DVD's, then low and behold what comes out, the Extended Version.... I will not be falling for this scam anymore, in fact I don't even buy movies when they first come out anymore because of it. I usually exercise some patience, no matter how much I like the movie, and wait for the extended, or directors cut, or whatever other special type of DVD/Blu-ray disk they come out with 6 months later."
1,Deja vu,"Both editions should be in the same package, period. You have to know that this will be up for sale again in 2020 in 2160p. It's a total money grab. Give the fans what they want, which is everything."
1,Terrible Customer Abuse - WHY DIDN'T YOU RELEASE EXTENDED?,I wish I were surprised by this but sadly I'm not.I WILL NOT BUY THIS!!The extended editions of the trilogy are the only ones worth spending money on. I just wish someone in senior management at New Line would have pulled their heads out of their rear ends and released their best product and not this time waster.These are some of the best motion pictures ever made but releasing the theatrical editions without the full movies on Blu Ray is just plain stupid.I would have paid $130 for both...I'm sure I'm not the only on. New Line...buttheaded move!
5,You'd be crazy not to buy this!!!!!!,"Is exactly as described and much much more!!!!!!! If you are a true LOTRs fan you MUST!!! have this because you are not complete without this uncut and extended version! i could go on and on about this collection but i won't, i will just say , BUY IT AND YOU WONT REGRET IT! TRUST ME!!!!!The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)"
5,Great buy!,"I was looking for the set for my husband as a gift because every time he went to rent the first movie, it wasn't available. I saw this deal and read the reviews for it. There was some debate about whether or not it included special features or widescreen versus fullscreen (from die hard fans vs. those who enjoyed the movies) but that was not important for me. I just wanted all three (the trilogy) in a set for a good price. I purchased it and it was shipped so quickly and my husband loved, loved, loved it!! He has watched all three films and I have to say, for the price, it was cheaper than renting them for a few days!! Fantastic deal from a very satisfied customer."
3,Steelbook for Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"I didn't know it was for a 'blue ray' thought it was a set of regular DVD of Lord of the Rings. My mistake. I am able to return the product. Thanks, Sydney"
1,Disappointed at just one version,"I WAS going to buy this. I've been waiting for it for a long time. However, I don't have any plans on buying the Theatrical version and then the EE. So I will just wait for the EE to come out"
1,not extended version - DO NOT BUY,lame that they are putting this crappy edition out just to make money and trick people. such a shame. 1 star for you
1,THEATRICAL NOOOO!!! EXTENDED YESSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Here in Brazil the extended version is not launched. If the blu of theatrical is released, we are never see the extended here. NEVER!!!!PLEASE AMERICAN FRIENDS!!! SAY NOOOOOO TO THEATRICAL!!!!"
1,Triple dipping be damned! Who is going to buy this in 3-D?,"Agree with people who are saying this is shameless double-dipping. Wait for Extended BD versions, they will come out!Actually by the time they release them, 3-D TV is going to be the next new thing, so you might as well hold off to buy a 3-D extended BD version.Just kidding, buy the extended BD, pass this ""theatrical release"".Peace"
1,This is NOT the extended version,"I don't know why so many people gave this 5 stars, then complained it was not the extended version and would not buy it. Go back and change your rating to 1 star to let everyone know this is nothing but a stunt to get us to buy the movie twice, AGAIN. Don't fall for it, and don't give this anything but 1 star."
1,This should get no stars,"This is all about greed. These are great movies but don't waste your money on it. Wait until the extended version comes out. If you buy this, you are just encourging these studios to keep trying to make us double dip."
1,My BD player upsamples the DVD great,"As every critic here has said, this is a shameful, slap in the face to the consumers by the studio. My BD player upsamples the DVDs quite nicely, and until I have a need to replace them because of wear and tear, or my 2 year old getting a hold of them and making them useless, I'm not going to buy them again. And when I do have to replace them, I'd rather wait for the extended versions. I can always rent these versions until I can buy what I actually want."
1,This is very unfair to the consurmer,"I believe they really are double dipping and it's unfair to the consumer. I will be holding out until the full extended release on blu-ray. They could have quite easily release both version simultaneously or better yet, use the power of blu-ray to contain both theatrical and extended version of the films and give the viewer a choice as to which version to watch. This is a rip-off."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"... DON'T BUY this edition of the Blu-Ray disc. Wait for the Extended Edition, which is FAR better. The studio is just trying to milk everyone by releasing this one first, knowing everyone will buy the Extended Edition later.SHAME on you Newline! :("
1,Extended Editions or Bust!,"Theatrical release?!?!! What a lame and completely shameless attempt at a cash-in! No true fan of the Lord of the Rings would settle for anything less than the Extended editions. I'm sure that news about the Extended releases will be soon to follow. But darn it, we've waited long enough! Give us what we want already!"
5,Extended edition is worth it!,"I watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy both extended and non-extended editions. If your a LOTR enthusiast, then get the extended. If you not, then get the non-extended.The extended helps straighten out some odd-parts, an also goes with the books a bit better. But it's also a bit longer, and can be a bit boring at times.But for me, extended is the best. This platinum series is also really nice; they come in beautiful cases and look really fancy."
1,For Shame New LIne,"Blu-ray disks can definitely have space for BOTH theatrical and extended versions of these films. This is clearly a money making scam. Word of advice, don't buy this version and send a message to New Line and the other studios that they can't keep ripping the public off. We already pay enough for DVD and Blu-ray. Shame, Shame."
1,"A BIG ""NO"" TO NEWLINE!!!!","NewLine and Peter Jackson are a joke! READ BETWEEN THE LINES DUMMIES: just give the fans what they want, VALUE. How is attempting to sell someone the movie they want in 2 different versions for twice the price giving value to the consumer?That's what I thought."
1,Do NOT buy! Wait for extended!!! This is bull,"I hate it when studios take advantage of dedicated fans who will be suckered into buying every edition they come out with for a movie. Double-dipping is a sad practice and should be put to a stop. When blow-ray first came out, there were already plans for LOTR, and it's extremely disappointing that they would release the theatrical versions only with no extended cuts.New Line - think about it. Who is the blu-ray audience? We are all informed consumers who are up to date with the latest trends. Most likely, we all know that there were extended editions of these movies and we will not stand for this crap. Stop taking advantage of us consumers."
1,Please!!!,"No way should you waste your money on the short versions...This is easily just a plot to rake as much cash out of it as they can. I'll wait for the extended versions before I buy blue ray. After watching the almost 10 hour version of the triligy, is there anyway you should go back to the short chopped up one... Get real New line most people are smarter then that... I hope..."
1,No way,"I'll make my purchase when the Extended Editions are released. Until that time, I'll settle for the extended versions on ""standard"" DVD.I wonder if New Line knows how poorly the Amazon Reviews are???"
1,No way I am getting fooled again,The title speaks for itself. I gonna keep watching my DVDs til the extended blu-rays come out
1,Boycott this release!,Definately boycott this release. Send a message to the studios. Consumers shouldn't be screwed over by multiple editions of a product. They are holding the extended editions till The Hobbit comes out. So they will milk us for these regular editions. Enough is enough.BOYCOTT!
1,No way,I totally agree with the other 1-star reviews. Tolkien would roll over in his grave if he could see this kind of corporate exploitation of his masterpiece. Bluray discs are more than capable of holding both versions for that matter.
1,Dont buy this,Please everyone...don't buy this...be wise and wait for the extended versions. They are baiting us to double-dip.
3,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"I WANTED THIS CD TO HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE ON THE PLAYLIST. AND THIS CD ONLY HAS 2 SONGS...NO ACAPELLA, NO INSTRUMENTAL. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND I'M DEFINITELY NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT EITHER. IF YOU GOING TO SELL SOMETHING ON AMAZON, MAKE SURE YOUR SELLING WHAT YOU CLAIM TO BE SELLING. #FALSEHOPE"
4,All deadbeat dads should peep this woman's fury,"I first heard this song on Hot 97 in New York radio in 1994 during a mix and I just had to get it. Being a proud father of a baby girl (my daughter was 1 when this song came out) I've never understood how men could do that to their child.""Baby's Father"" is about a baby's mama (Madame Star) ticked off and fed up about a daddy not taking responsibilities to his young son and letting him know about it (in many ways). In three furious verses, Madame Star gives it to him like any deadbeat father should get it from the baby's mama. At the end of the first verse she wastes no time giving him props on the June Hoilday 'hope you have a f'd up Father's day'.Madame Star's ""Baby's Father"" was released on Cold Chillin' Records, which brought fame to Biz Markie, Big Daddy Kane and Roxanne Shante to name a few. After hearing ""Baby's Father"" fierce delivery and on point flow, where Madame Star's album release? She deserved one. And I'm still waiting!"
2,Redline: Xtreme Air Racing 2,I purchased this game because of a positive write up in Air & Space magazine. They mentioned that the graphics were very basic but the flight models were superb. I installed the software as soon as it came in the mail and had nothing but problems. Sometimes it wouldn't even load. Other times it would load but I couldn't select the aircraft I wanted to fly. The game also locks up very often. I checked on the Encore web site for patches and tech support and have found neither. I sent an e-mail to tech support during the first week of March and still haven't received a reply (its now 3-30-04). I suggest you save your money or buy another simulator.
4,Don't use on coconuts,"For non-professional knives, I think these are pretty dern good. Easy to sharpen, easy to handle (very light), and very easy to keep clean and sanitary, being all one-piece stainless steel (I hand wash). Not good for hacking apart coconuts... quickly transforms chef knife into serrated."
1,Not a good book,"I bought this book along with the companion ""An opening repertoire for the attacking player"" and I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed. The lines given are not particularly popular. Not only that, I crossed referenced some of the lines with other books and a database, and the results were depressing: hardly ever did white get and advantage and black's choices were rather limited. There are very few explanations. If you are searching for a complete repertoire, this is not it. You will not understand why you are playing certain moves."
5,Amazing!!!!,My son loves it! He got it as bday present when he turned 3. Now he's 5 and still plays with it.
5,A wonderful book,"I initially picked up this book from the library because it's on display and because I thought it would be a great read for my daughter since she also has two dolls: a small one we bought for her first birthday, and the other more luxurious one when she was around two and half year old. She's so in love with this book that I had to buy a copy for our own. It is such an enchanted story, but real at the same time."
4,Pretty good,The battery fits well and works well.Mine had a minor flaw with the release handle dangling instead of staying put.
4,ESHAM #1,Ive been a down esham fan for a log time and this is one of my fav Esham albums just sit back and start from 1 his style is the same but his beats are fresher then befor its a mix between the albums Bruce Wayne and Dead Flowers any esham fan like me pick dis up its a promis its gonna be a fav.
3,Not E's best,"A couple of songs are great, but only Gotham City 1987 was worse. He catches himself on all later albums, fortunaltly."
3,Acid Rap is Slowly Dying,"Out of the 22 trax on this disc, only 10 at the most are barely worth listening to.Of those 10, only maybe 6 are of the acid rap style Esham has pioneered throughout the years.Stick to Pre-""Closed Casket"" Everything else afterwards-""Dead Flowers"",""Bruce Wayne"",and ""Mail Dominance"" along with the few radio edit singles show a slow demise of something that was once great.Natas on the otherhand is still worth picking up.Esham seems to do a better job with pals TNT and Mastamind.Can't wait for wwwDOTcom in April '99.Stay Reel!"
3,its an ok but not the best ive herd ftom him,the maildomanince cd is a ok disk it not like the old ones but every one changes . there are only a few good tracks that i like but if you are a real fan pick it up
2,Very disappointed,"I have purchased many Global knives and love them all. For the money I feel like they are hard to beat. However i am very disappointed with this knife. Out of the box this is the most dull Global knife I have ever used. I had a hard time pealing a potato with this knife. I will be purchasing more Global knives I am sure, but I will be purchasing them from a brick and mortar store where I can test the knife before I purchase it as I have my other knives."
3,"Great idea, poor development","This is a great book for summarizing Buddhism and Christianity, there histories, beliefs, and dogmas. But the final summary of whether or not Jesus was teaching Buddhism was very weak and consisted of one small chapter which really I expected to find through out the book. Toward the end of the book the author also expressed how the United States was going to hell in the late 1920's (The book was written in 1927)due to the new jazz, radio, and swing dancing. That did not belong in the book. Also he talked about how great communism would be and how evil and greedy capitalism is. That is ridiculous and did not belong here. I may have to write my own book and separate Jesus's teachings into the 4 Noble truths and eightfold path to show that they are the same. This is not the right book to prove anything or even make good comparisons."
3,history vs. insight,"There is more scholarship to add to this, given the fact that it was written a while ago. For more recent scholarly insight, you could read ""The Original Jesus: The Buddhist Sources of Christianity"" by Elmar R. Gruber and Holger Kersten, and if you are trying to understand more about the theology of it, try Ken Leong's fabulous book, ""The Zen Teachings of Jesus."""
2,Costumes--not what you might expect,"Don't be fooled--This book is NOT a how-to guide. There are no ideas or instructions to be had here. It's an easy reader, and a pretty stupid one at that. Nothing interesting or clever about the text. Just the requisite (very) limited vocabulary and boring sentence structure. I always figure that kids introduced to reading with this type of book probably die of boredom or give up in disgust before they crack the literary code!"
4,"Great for sharpening, but...","First off I would like to say that these work as advertised and are a wonderful tool. They help immensely when sharpening your Globals. That being said, I do have one minor complaint about them. They grip the knife too tight. When you slide them on to the blade they leave a decent scratch. Granted, this isn't the end of the world and by no means reduces the quality of your knife, but it's quite frusterating to see scratches running along the tops of all your brand new (and expensive) knives. If you are interested in buying them, get them. They are great! I just wish someone had warned me about the scratches first."
5,Good Nature Recording,"This recording is of natural sounds only, no music. The recording and mastering quality is excellent. This is the best recording I have heard of frogs so far. The sounds come in waves."
2,Silly fish story misses mark,"White Shark/Creature (the cover of Creature clearly states that this was previously released as White Shark) is about a hidden Nazi plot being released. Something is in the water and it is vicious. It kills like a shark but is not. It's a man-shark hybrid! Now here is the really silly part, the creature has been taught how to adapt to land (it has done this before), but it has not been taught how to go back in the water (so how did it get there?).So, after creating havoc in the water, the creature becomes the Saturday Night Live ""land shark"" and starts stalking the land. Just when you decided to never go in the water again, the sharks take to land.This was a huge disappointment after Beast and the movie was even worse. If you want a good book, this one is not it."
3,A bit much...,"OK, I love Peter Benchley & have all his books. This one was a bit of a miss for me. (Spoilers ahead - Stop reading if you haven't read the book) - I just can't suspend my disbelief this far. I can believe in monsters of all sorts - especially since one only has to read the headlines to see that they are out there in all imaginable forms. However, I had some trouble thinking that a half man-half shark Nazi had survived in a box for 50 years and now was wreaking havoc. Also, the ability to go onto land was a bit fanciful. It was a well written book, and Benchley always makes us care about the characters. Its amazing how this man does it... Anyhow, this book just wasn't for me, but it does have a very very cool ending - if you can handle the pressure! (Pun intended)I can't wait for your next one Mr. Benchley!Relic113"
3,"Very original villain, mediocre plot","Definitely not your garden-variety thriller. Featured was a truly original villain, one that I was fascinated by and wanted to get more details on.The reason for the three-star review is that the plot was pedestrian. While reading the book, I could think of loads of ways to create more tension. Much of the book's content was occupied in describing characters that really didn't add to the plot, most of which I found tremendously boring.An interesting read, but could have been much better."
4,Pay attention People!!!!!!!,"First off, I would like to say this is the first Benchley book I have read, and enjoyed it quite a bit. For those of you who are confused as to why its called white shark when the creature is a man-beast, here is a newsflash: Its called white shark because the robot creature has a german name which means white shark. Re-read it, and look towards the end, I don't remember which chapter, one of the last few, and if you pay attention, you don't need to pay alot, you'll find your answer."
4,Fun water thriller,"I like Peter Benchley. I love the water, and so I love reading books about the water. My favorite movie is Jaws, and I am into anything based around the ocean and its mystery. If you are like me you will enjoy this book. Benchley is great at building excitement and suspense. The characters are pretty strong and likable. The story flows along quickly. This is a good summer read. Nothing too deep here, but a fun ocean thriller."
3,Not Quite A Great White...,"There's something lacking to this still intriguing tale of a monster gone haywire--even scaring the sharks away! Benchley spends a lot of time building up the scenarios--only giving you quick glimpses of the murky menace as it kills and kills, throwing tempting morsels of info about the heroes without offering a whole package...chumming for readers, I suppose. The main problem I had was that it was simply too short. It was as if the author had something else he'd rather be working on, so he quickly cut his line and tied the whole thing off. For all its cinematic buildup, the big dispatch-with-the-monster scene came too soon and wasn't satiating enough. Not bad, a good, quick, page-turner, but it could've been longer and better."
1,"Bad premise, bad book","This book is simply dreadful. The premise is so implausable as to be laughable. Engineered Nazi zombie with steel teeth and claws gets loose after being preserved in a u-boat for fifty years, to terrorize the coast. An author not named Benchley would not be able to get this published. Apart from some well written passages about the water, marine life and coastal towns, the book is bad. I mean, it is really bad. The title is deceptive (white shark being the code name for the Nazi Zombie) and the main charactors are so wooden as to be painful. One has to respect Benchley as the master of his genre, but he would have been better off having typed this one to re-read it and toss it in the garbage. He didn't, and there it is. Please do not read this book. Please do not buy this book."
5,A Fast Paced Thriller,"Peter Benchley is a truly amazing writer of the deep. But I must say after reading Jaws I was very mad because he discribed The Great White as a blood thirsty killing machine. In White Shark the creature from the deep is a expariment gone wrong not a Great White. There is a White in this story and Peter Benchley describes it as a butiful wonder of the deep, NOT a evil killing thing. The characters in this book are trully amazing and unforgetable. Benchley does a terrific job of making you feel for the characters. And of all the attack parts are really good if not a litte GROSS. This book trully bad Jaws look like a pet goldfish phisicly and in the way that this book kicks the book Jaws out of the water. Want a good book with thrills and chills... Read White Shark By Petetr Benchley!"
3,"Unique plot with an interesting twist on ""Jaws"" genre!","This book is quick and easy-to-read. The premise of the story is based on the cruel human experimentation conducted by the Nazi Regime. A human killing machine was created and accidentally lost in the depths of the sea where it rested for years until accidentally discovered. After its escape, the creature goes on a killing spree...and the story begins!In all, the book is easy to read and enjoyable, but doesn't require much concentration to follow and is easy to put down/pick back up."
5,A fast and intense read,I found the book to be very well writen and creative. I couldn't put it down from the moment I started and actually finished it in two days. I would easily recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a fun thriller.
3,My first Benchley book and I'm hooked!,"OK, there's no real surprises here--you know that the monster's going to terrorise the waters around a fishing community, kill a few scientists and members of the public, and maybe screw up the ecosystem a little bit. Then there'll be a final chaotic conclusion where the beast is revealled for what it is and in some imaginative Benchley-way slain by the good scientist and his chirpy family. Good enough for me! Predictable as the course of the plot is, this is ideal escapism and for summer reading you can really get sucked into it. Nothing strikingly original here, so perhaps I only enjoyed it so much because I wasn't familiar with the author. Veteran Benchley fans might not like it so much, but for anyone new to him I'd say this is as good a place to start as any! OK, so the plot is a bit naff. OK, so the characters are all a little annoying. A LOT annoying. But, come on, this isn't Dante. Just kick back in your deckchair and enjoy the ride!"
2,Great White is a guppy gray.,"WOW! What was he writing about? The story was okay ... but the ending was the worst I have ever read. It kept building up, then dropped me like a rock into shallow water with jagged rocks. I think the fall would be more of an adventure than the book. Please, Peter, more excitement next time, and a much better ending."
2,Simply unbelievable...,"I was very disappointed with this book; I expected something of the quality of Jaws but instead found myself reading a shallow and disappointing story that is quite simply not worth the money to buy. Benchley is a good writer, and the story is readable enough, but is badly (read BADLY) let down in the believability stakes. If you want to read this book, find it in a library; don't waste your money buying it."
1,Scary but weak,"Peter Benchley has gone down a path that too many writers face. He has totally run out of ideas. This story does take place on the high seas, however Benchley gets away from the true terrors of the deep, which is his strong suit.The story revolves around a genetically made killer, that can live on land and sea. Benchley tries to bring together the cruelity of man and place it with the killer instinct of great white shark. The idea is there, but the book will keep you shaking your head, as of the whereabouts of what made Benchley famous. The characters were not well rounded and made the story very dull. There are some great moments of gore and terror, but they are to few and far between. If this is your first Benchley you might want to grab one of his older classics. This one missed the mark a long way!"
4,Certainly worth your time,"Creature is a bizarre story, plain and simple. Still, it's a very entertaining story. Of course, the creature itself is very unlikely, but that's typical of science fiction. (I notice that some people who reviewed this book criticized it for it's lack of probability, but then again, no fictitious book is innocent of that charge). Anyway, if you can overlook that and suspend your belief as you read, you'll find this to be a very enjoyable book."
2,You have got to be kidding!,"A pyschopathic killer with gills? This was just a little hard to swallow. And he's lived on the ocean floor - two miles deep - for fifty years but only needed a few shrimp to survive? Until, miracle of miracles, his coffin is accidently discovered - in the middle of the ocean - Then he decides to really start feeding? WOW! I have more realisitic nightmares about goblins chasing me as I fly from tree-top to tree-top. The really unbelievable part is I paid $6.99 for this - after having already read it a few years ago under the title White Shark. I Hate when that happens!"
4,Simply a reprint of White Shark -- Dont buy if you own it,"White Shark was made into a television mini-series for ABC and was re-titled 'Creature'. DO NOT buy this book if you already own 'White Shark'.The creature itself, a product of Nazi experimentation is awakened near a small island off the coast of connecticut. A marine biologist soon finds himself fighting to save himself and the ones he loves from this bilogical weapon. Most of us are familiar with the insane Nazi experiments conducted during WWII. Attempts to re-animate the dead and create, quite literally, biological weapons in the forms of 'creatures' all were failures...as far as we know. (Gamers may see similiarity between the video game Resident Evil and the real-life experiments of the Nazi regime in terms of 'Bio' weapons and 'zombies') Read my review of White Shark for my full opinion on this book!"
2,A disappointing monster novel.,"It is difficult to write a good monster novel. If the author makes the creature too unbelievable, the reader will just not buy into the concept and dismiss it as wacky. If the creature is not fantastic enough, the reader will lose his sense of awe and fear. There is no question that this is a tough balancing act.Unfortunately, this book never finds that special balance. The idea toes the line between being trite or moderately interesting (Nazi experiment produces hybrid monster) but the delivery is lacking. There is nothing I can say that will articulate exactly what this book is lacking except that I feel it is missing that intangible ""magic"".My advice to you is to read this if you must, but otherwise there are other better monster novels out there."
2,Pretty lousy re-hash,"First of all, the menacing creature in the book is not a white shark; it's not even close to being one. They just slapped that title on here because Benchley wrote ""Jaws"" and they wanted to cash in on it. Second of all, what the creature actually is is so completely ridiculous that it loses the power to frighten the reader. If you need a cheap summer thriller to burn through in a day or two, there are probably others out there that have at least a shred of credibility to make it interesting. How many more dead deer and sea lions do we have to see to build endless suspense for something silly?"
3,I could not but this book down...,"...but when I finished it I felt cheated on some level. Benchley seemed to be slumming it. After rehashing Jaws into a superior (and terrifying) book he turns around and mixes the Creature from the Black Lagoon, Piranha, and Jaws into an entertaining but creatively bankrupt novel. If this had not been from the author of Jaws and Beast I would give it three or four stars, but I have to dock it on the principal that both the reader and the author know the story could be a lot more than it is. This book marks a conclusion of sorts to a Sea Monster Trilogy (Jaws and Beast being the first two in the series) and is the weakest of them all. It is clearly time for Benchley to move onto other subjects."
4,Nazi horror at its sea-lion eating best,"This novel was a great book. Wonderful plot. lots of suspense. You felt sad for the people who died because Peter gave you so much info about their lives. And you feel so sad for the poor sea lions that get eaten. This is a real addicting book.The only complaint is the ending.God, all of Benchleys endings are strange.I mean, the thing was blown to bits!dont all his books end that way?And the thing isnt a shark. its more like a half human monster. The only reason i can think that he named it white shark is because the scientist, Simon Chase, was studying a white shark. But aside from a few minor srew ups, its a good read."
5,Great Comic Book,This hardcover edition came with a card of a painting of Solid Snake that was signed and numbered by the artist Ashley Wood. The comic itself is excellent. Ashley Wood's art style is very unique and the writing by Kris Oprisko is done very well also. This hardcover features the first six issues of the comic. The comic is based on the original Metal Gear Solid game that was released by Konami in 1998. Several parts of the comic cover stuff only referred to in the game. This is a great buy for Metal Gear and comic book fans alike.
2,watch out,"The good: rotatable earcups, foldable, easy to carry around, cheapThe bad: sound quality ins't that great, headphones has a hiss, they are easy to break, and the cable is all springed up, in which makes it really short, if you going to use the headphones in distance then I suggest you will need to get a cable extention in which again, more money needs to be spent, and lastly the quality of the headphone itself feels cheapFinal Statement: better off spending a few extra bucks on a better pair of headphones rather than this one"
3,Unauthorized Charger,"I thought I was purchasing the real deal Motorola charger. Has the Motorola M on the charger, packaging looks authentic. Sometimes I get the ""unauthorized charger"" error and sometimes I do not. The price was right but I am still not real impressed. I wonder if it is a problem with Motorola in general or my razr cell phone. Eithe way it is annoying.I would not buy this product again."
4,"Good item, good price","This charger came quickly, was priced right and looks and works better than the original. Can't beat that with a stick."
2,Not Worth It.,"This worked for us for about a few months, and then one day it just stopped working, we bought two, the first one NEVER even worked, waste of money."
3,"Ok it's a recharger, what's to review",Yeah!It's a recharger.It recharges my cell phone.It has a fancy blue light.What more could you ask???
1,Zero stars: it did not work. Probably a counterfeit,"When I tried to recharge my phone, I got a message tellingme it was an unauthorized charger. No, I did not order the wrong charger. Given the charger's price, my suspicion is the charger was counterfeit. But I will grant the possibility that it was simply a defective charger."
1,WARNING Amazon ships COUNTERFEITS without retail pkg,"Warning I ordered this more expensive Motorola Retail Packaging option from Amazon and I received cheap counterfeit product. I was careful to purchase right from Amazon and not a 3rd party seller in the ""more buying choices"" screen.There are no Motorola holograms and when compared to a real OEM that I purchased elsewhere with the same part #, the real Motorola has the part # and regulatory labels printed on a different type of sticker. Also the fake one has a wider connection to the car, and has cheaper plastic molding on the unitI have had my cell phones damaged in the past by non original power sources so these are going back. I am going to send one to Motorola instead of Amazon so that hopefully they can investigate and require Amazon to pull this item.If I had bought these only from Amazon I admit I would have been fooled. But since I already had one of the the real product sourced I could tell."
1,eforcity,"I bought this item on amazon through eforcity, it does not work and upon emailing about the problem to eforcity, they did not reply back, can someone claim the responsibility, poor work done"
1,FRIED IN 60 SECONDS!!!,"I plugged it in and it worked for about 1 minutes then never worked again. Big Lot's had one for $4.99 so why bother returning it. I was charged that much for shipping in the first place and they sent it via US Mail. I really don't believe this is genuine Motorola, it has the logo but I believe it to be a fake. It's super lightweight and feels cheap, has no light on it and it came packaged in a cheap plastic bag inside of a paper envelope.RIP_OFF"
1,Cheap Imitation,"Despite the counterfeit warning right on the same page, this appears to be just that! It comes in a little baggie with no information on it, whereas the real thing does come in ""Motorola retail packaging,"" and lists which of their models it fits, along with other information. The down side is that the real one costs $22 from Verizon."
5,Best All Around,"I was in the market for a RAZR V3 charger when I came across this one at such a low price. I was a little apprehensive about purchasing, but now I am glad I did. Works perfect. Best all around."
3,Works just fine,It's clearly a knock-off but it works just fine charging Krazr. Good value for cost.
2,Coincidence?,I purhcased this car charger and a few weeks later by batter started running for only short periods of time. I don't know if this had anything to do with it or maybe the battery just needed to go.
4,Works as advertised,"There's not much one can say about a car power adapter for a cell phone. It does what it's suppossed to, without a lot of fuss. The design is simple and intuitive. The blue Motorola logo lights up when power is active, which is cool, but other than that, there's not much to say - which is how it should be with such an ubiquitous item."
5,Motorola Car charger,"Great item, purchased in 2008, still using it. Allways works. Reccommend to everyone!Compatible to several motorola models, check if it's compatible to yours before you buy it."
2,It falls out of the power outlet.,"The blue light is tacky and blinding in the car at night. It is helpful in showing you that the adapter has fallen out of the power outlet again, however. Buy a competing micro-USB charger instead."
5,Great!,"For 1/5th of the price of the charger my cell provider was trying to foist on me when I upgraded my phone, this did the job, and looked beautiful to boot. I enjoyed the novelty of the back-lit Motorola logo, which was also a nice reminder that you still had something plugged into the cigarette lighter.)"
1,car phone adapter,I have no use for the motorola cigarette lighter adapter for motorola phones .I ordered a micro USB and I recieveda regular one that I cannot use with the razr 3
4,Works for HTC models,"I purchased this for my HTC MyTouch phone. It works better than any other charger I have tried, and it charges my battery faster. Great for getting as much juice into the phone on a short trip in the car.If my friends car had not had a faulty lighter plug that burnt out my charger, I would not have had to buy another one of these.I highly recommend this charger. The only negative is it does not have it's own fuse."
4,Very Good Charger,"The Charger came in Original Pack From Motorola, The Blue Light is a Plus.Amazon as always Did a Great Job,( I Ordered On Friday, And put My Hands On it On Tuesday).The Cord is a Little Bit Short,But I Use Bluetooth, So No a big issue."
1,Motorola Cigarette Lighter Adapter For Motorola RAZR V3,"I ordered a Motorola brand RAZR V3 car charger and recieved a Power Glo auto charger for a Blackberry. My phone wouldn't recognize this charger. It definitely not the one I ordered. Amazon will pay for the return shipping, after I paid to have the wrong charger shipped because of their mistake. Doesn't seem quite right. Why no 0 Star rating to chose when we rate items? Should be a choice. I wish I had gone to EBAY."
5,Does the job,What more do I need to say.I plug one end into my car and the other end into my RAZR and it charges the battery. Oh yeah you can't beat the price!
1,Charger did not work for RAZR,"This charger looks like a Motorola charger, but when it was attached to a Motorola RAZR phone it said that it was not an authorized charger and did not work."
5,Genuine Product,Great price on the genuine Motorola charger for my Q. Much cheaper than Best Buy or Verizon and I got it in record time!
1,Buyer beware,"This charger was recommended for the RAZR2 phone. The product probably works fine, but unfortunately it doesn't fit the phone it was advertised with. I have never used it and strongly recommend you make sure this product actually fits your phone before ordering - Amazon's recommendations aren't always correct."
2,You get what you pay for,Great price - glad I bought 2. Put a bit of stress on the connector where it meets the phone and it snapped away. Hopefully the second one won't suffer the same fate.
4,smelled like gasoline,"Went through two orders before I figured that the whole shipment was doused with the smell. So on the last resort I put it in disinfectant, it worked and its fine. The product is cute but it was too much trouble."
1,Merchandise never arrived,Merchandise never arrived. I received a notice that the merchandise order was cancelled. I never cancelled the order. I concluded that you did not have the merchandise. I hope you did not charge me for it.
1,Terrible Customer Service; BUYER BEWARE!,DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS DEALER!!!I purchased the OEM Motorola car charger for my Droid and they sent a generic car charger like you get in a gas station and it was for a blackberry not a Droid. I emailed them to let them know there was a mistake and the person in charge wrote me back and said that the package may be different than what was originally purchased but she was sure it was the right part. However I knew when I sent the email that it wasn't the right charger nor was it what they advertised. I sent another email letting them know it was FOR SURE not the right charger and I never heard back from them! BUYER BEWARE!
5,Convienent Product,"I love this item! I love the look, it's really cute. The 'M' logo on the adapter lights up when it's on. It's a very convienent product. Much better than the cheap ones they give you for free. Believe it or not, it charges my razr and my nano itrip because it has the same exact plug as my razr. So its wonderful because it's like a 2 in 1. The cord may seem a little short, but then you could stretch it out if you'd like. This is a wonderful product, I love it, and I haven't had any problems with it."
1,If you own a Mini DO NOT BUY THIS CHARGER,Bargaincell very graciously sent me a replacement charger and it too is not working. I read in another review that you had to really shove this charger in so I did with no luck. It's just incompatible with the Mini Cooper.The one from Cingular works.
2,design defect,"Died after several months intermittent use. Not solidly made, and ifyou accidentally press the blue M which lights up, it can get easilypushed in, crushing some circuitry and resulting in a dead adapter."
5,Great value.,I maintain a number of phones under harsh conditions. I get six of these chargers for the price of one from the phone store.
3,Blue light,The charger lights up which is pretty cool. At night it is too bright. The charger works fine
1,Motorola Car Charger,"The seller said this charger would work on the Rarz2 phone. IT DOES NOT! Will not fit the charge slot on the phone. A complete waste of money. Be careful what you buy, the description for an item is not always true."
1,Nice looking Motorola Lighter Adapter,"This power source for my Razr phoone arrived quickly at a great price.It lasted four days and was then DOA. There is no way to change a fuse onit, so therefore is a waste of money IMHO"
1,dont waste your money,"its a worst product I have ever seen by motorola. It charges my phone but I have to hold the jack that goes into phone, and also have to drive at same time.I bought Belkin's similar product from Walmart for $10 and it rocks."
4,Its a car charger and works.,"Order mine from Amazon and had no problems with shipping or packaging. It fits perfectly in all the car power ports I have plugged it into. I haven't timed how long it takes to charge the Razr, but it certainly doesn't seem 'slow'.For $6 plus shipping this works just as it should."
5,Nice,This is great. It is actually genuine Motorola and you don't have to worry that it won't be compatible. The light on the cigarette charger end lets me know that it is really plugged in while I'm driving (a great safety feature).
2,"Again, great product, but unreliable shipping/communication","Item was good, but took twice as long as to arrive (over 3 weeks) as stated by Bargain Cell. Order elsewhere if you need the item inside of a month. They also charge higher shipping rates for these accessories than are set out on the amazon.com website. No bargain!"
4,Good Product,"I got this because it was good price and its works as intended. Not much can be said, it’s a car charger."
5,pleased,Very good product. Much better than the cheap one I had that only worked once in a while. Love it.
4,good but not in a retail package,I bought it as a gift for a freind. It came as described but unfornatley not in the retail fancy package as stated.I have no time to call the seller and return.
2,"""Motorola"" Charger Clones","Very questionable quality. Would not buy again. Should have paid more attention to the Motorola Genuine Products warning attached to the item listing. Price should not be an issue when dealing with electrical products. It works, but... What was I thinking?"
4,Krzr car charger,Works great once connected to the cigarette lighter but you have to fiddle with it a bit to get it in right. At first I thought it was the wrong size. It charges quickl and appears sturdy and well made so I'm pleased overall and would recommend it.
5,Cigarette Lighter Adapter,"I bought 2 of these phone chargers and am happy with them. Even with shipping, they cost way less than just one charger at a store. In the picture, though, it appears that the whole 'M' part lights up blue, but really only a small dot lights up blue."
3,Item is a Motorola but not the one pictured here,The item works and it's affordable so I would give it a 5 for working as designed. I give the vendor a 1 for false advertising by showing the wrong picture for the actual product I received. Overall a 3. I didn't bother to call them for a resolution since I don't think it's really worth the aggravation.
5,uplifting,Paths to Prayer: Finding Your Own Way to the Presence of GodThis is a very good book. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
4,successor to james ellroy,"""shooters"" is a very good, hyperbolic novel about the horror of l.a. and the ""industry"". the overall ambience is like that of a contemporary james ellroy and (maybe) a ""straight"" dennis cooper, plus the superb nik cohn. if the forthcoming film ""boogie nights"" delivers on its promise, this novel should have an intersted audience"
3,A Review of SHOOTERS,Good read. Wished it was longer with an ending by Michael Connelly. I would suggest you try it to take up time in a waiting room.
1,Did I read the same book as these other people?,"I just read this book on a plane trip to Hawaii. I found it amateurish, predictable, and very mediocre. If you want to read a good book from this genre, pick up any book by James Ellroy or Andrew Vachss. This book wasn't even a good trashy beach read."
4,Reality bites,Seen the film? Shocked? Now read the book for the real lowdown of life in Brazilian shantytowns.Shocked by scenes of young children being shot in the hand or foot (their choice) in the film. That's just the tip of the ice berg.Paulo Lins lived in 'cidade de deus' and he paints us a frighteningly clear picture of its reality. He has since received death threats for all the unwanted attention he has brought to the favela.A top read. Highly recommended.
4,Author's Quote,"From an interview with Paulo Lins, published today in the NY Times: ""Though Mr. Lins now lives a middle-class life, he still visits the City of God, 'where I still have family and friends and am treated as if I were a celebrity, like Michael Jackson.'"" (I'm sure no irony was intended.)The reporter adds, ""Thanks in part to the enthusiastic international response to the movie, the book has been translated into English, Spanish, French, Italian and German, among other languages."""
4,Rock with heart,"Kingfish...who would have thunk it??? I knew of Matthew Kelly from Ratdog, and thought that Kingfish was some Bobby side project...clearly not the case. this album is rocking throughout...the band is tight and the songs are great. The Jerry track is a touching bonus as well. This is a must have for all classic rock fans, as well as those that are into the groove!"
5,Fantastic!,"I'm a homeschool Mom of four children--ages 7, 5, 4, and 2--and we used this book for a poetry unit. It is awesome! The illustrations are fun and the poems are easy to read with a lot of inflection and are about the perfect topics to keep my children interested. Also, it gave us lots of ideas for how to come up with our own poems. To top it off, there is a poem about dawdling. I have a dawdler and when we read the poem we laughed and laughed. Just a great collection and introduction to writing poetry."
5,King Tee the Great!,"if you are a fan of the n.w.a. camp;ice cube,eazy e,dr dre,ren,and yes the d.o.c.,youll straight love this album because hes the reason the west coast had to step up their techniques in mixin and rhymin in my opinion. king tee is one artist that straight up created a masterpiece because this whole album is simply perfect."
5,"Aaron Sookhai , Mechanical Technician,Machining student.","This book bridges that gap between school and real world.It should be is a class by itself,since so many technical books don't achieve this vital need.It all boils down to who could do the job right,fastest and cheapest.It's a great way to job security.I suggest you read a page or two before buying this book, and you will realize that anyone with BASIC machining sense and interpreting skills will appreciate the tips.I highly recommend this book."
4,A good book for beginner.,"This type of book is rare. Most book consist of theory after theory and formula after formula.Finall'you still do not know how to make a real piece. This is a book deal with real job in machine shop.It is the place different ideas turn into a real piece. This book also is a collection of many ideas and experience from the author. If you are a beginner in machining like me, you may find many practical advice from this book."
5,A Machine Shop Classic,"This well-written book deserves lots of accolade for its clear and useful information. Not only machine shop owners and workers, but everybody distantly relevant will find this book a must-have reference in his daily work. In the book, many common-sense, practical and 'obvious' advices and tips are provided generously. The author is good at explaining technical aspects in layman's terms thus making it easy to follow and understand. And the author has a good sense of humor too. One of my favorites is ""Blowing chips all over the guy next to you would be an example of a ""non-dimensional"" mistake that would likely irritate somebody."" Seriously, you don't expect you could have some laughs while studying such technical subject like machine shop operation! Yes, book like this surely brighten up your mundane workday."
2,Machine shop trade secrets ??,"Rather disappointed. Only a few real usefull hints, some obvious ""secrets"", very disorganized, no logic structure.I will be more careful selecting my next purchase espacially as I had to pay 10 Euro on top for the customs..."
2,Mediocure,"I thought this book would teach me something new and something I didn't already know. It didn't. If you Are new to the machining trade it is ok. If you have been around the block, it is the same old same old."
2,Listen Kiddies this is how it needs to be done!,His writing is goo he has good style and I was able to read though in just a couple of sittings. The are a very few items that are there to build to keep. I guess with all the hype I expected a lot more solid machining in this book. I do like the book but I think I spent a tad bit more than it was worth to get what was written.dray
3,Useful but not great,"Not organized well for finding information as a reference. A number of good tips, but very focused on perspective of a working machinist rather than amateur. For me, Machine Shop Essentials is a much better book."
3,I suppose it's OK,"The book is more like a bathroom read than a reference book, which may be the author's plan. Some good information and some silly ideas as well. I know this book gets generally great reviews, but an hour on you tube would get you this and more. I also got an attitude with his brief comment regarding GD&T. It's 2013 for Pete's sake; learn the rest of your trade."
5,Get this book,"If you're just starting out in the trade, or if you're a weekend warrior, this will be a hard book to put down. Lots of practical tips and tricks, good setup notes, and all around valuable time saving info. I highly recommend it."
3,Trade secrets,"The book has a lot of common sense information, but not enough hard core tricks to warrant the title in my opinion. I would have opted for a more technical book before maybe buying this."
4,Machine Shop Trade Secrets,"This book was an easy read,easy to understand and didn't want to put it down till I hit the back cover.Not like other books of this type where I had to reread to understand where they were going.One of those books when you finish it leaves you wanting more.Good enough to make me want to leave some feedback"
5,Machine Shop Trade Secrets: A Guide to Manufacturing Machine Shop Practices,This is a very easy to understand reference with practical tips for a novice or experienced machinist. I found the reading to be very worthwhile and information to be practical. Reading was easy to understand and this is one of the few books that I have read from cover to cover. I plan on re-reading sections and applying many of its suggestions.
2,Not OE style as indicated in description,"The passenger side version of this mirror is not convex, like the OE mirror. The driver's side is the same as the OE mirror, but it does not seem as sturdy as OE. I don't expect that these mirrors would last 25 years like my originals have.My guess is they did this so it can be used on left and right-hand drive vehicles."
3,book for a class,I ordered this as supplimentary reading for a religion class so it was not just a quick read through.I'm sure it will turn out to be what I needed.
5,should have won,this is an amazing screenplay. if you loved the movie you will love reading this. seeing the actions in print is just as powerful as watching on screen. this should have won best adapted screenplay (the royal tenenbaums should have won original).
3,Bhangal thinks beginners are what?,"I am sorry , reading the reviews I thought this would be great , so I bought it.I must say editing is horrible , no online help(wrote 5 mails not even 1 answer),lot of mistake in book.The code style changes often so the beginner is bit lost.Then Bhangal suddenly introduces heavy coding without explaining much often (Math.random()*5) +3 or Math.round()...he didn't explain the parameters of random no. selection in AS.only thing I can say you need to do this book more than once to get hang of AS if u r really a total beginner like me.If looking a fast way don't get into it if u r a total beginner"
3,Memories,This album is worth having if you saw this particular BTO lineup live. They were very energetic during this tour and I really thought this was the comenack of my favorite band. It is a helluva deal. Buy it and relish in some obsecure BTO!
2,The reason this is not a good album...,"...is because its really not Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Half of the band on this CD is not the true BTO line-up, and it shows. I did bump this up to 2 stars because I love the Fred Turner vocal on ""Bad News Travels Fast."" Other than that, don't waste your time - believe me, I love BTO, but I don't love this ""effort."""
2,WEak !,"BTO line-up in this formation is very irregular, and the resulting sound is disappointing. If you're a real bTO fan, you won't miss nothing skipping this one."
1,BTO should be BO instead,"I don't like BTO. I think that we should pass a constitutional amendment outlawing the playing of BTO on the radio. I mean, if you want to listen to this poo in the privacy of your own self-induced private hell, go ahead, but the rest of the world should not be forced to endure the absolute horror."
3,Fine for the price,"The blades on these knifes are effective, and it's nice that they can go in the dishwasher. The shears are great. However, the knifes are heavy and the handles don't feel good in your hand. If you're going to do daily cutting, go for more expensive knifes."
5,Review of Farberware Knife Block Set,"We couldn't help but enjoy this purchase. Amazon slashed the original purchase price by over 75% (Thanks, guys!), reducing the cost to $49.99. My employer had recently given me a $40 gift certificate for my years of service, and since this item qualified for free Super Saver Shipping, that, together with the gift certificate gave us a final price of $9.99! Unreal. Only $9.99 out of pocket. It is undoubtedly one of the best deals we've ever gotten . . . anywhere.And the fact that this is a high quality item doesn't hurt either. Excellent quality."
3,"Good book, but incomplete","If you're planing on studying Swedish in depth, than you should get Swedish: A Comprehensive Grammar written by the same author. It's much more complete with about three times as much content."
5,plantronics earbud,The product arrived in the time frame as promised. It was easy to use and worked as the description said it would.
3,Good Ideas,"This book contains a set of very nice ideas of the recent trends in the consumption of the American society. Very good study was done on the subject. I understand that this is not the first book on the subject by the authors, which makes it hard to comprehend a large number of references to the previous works. Also, the language of the book is way too ""scientified""."
1,horrible,"This is such a bad song and Sugar Ray sucks now....fly was a good song, but now they really are pretty bad. not worth a penny."
5,It is fantastic!,I think that that song is great! The first time I heard it said to myself I have to have it! I love hearing it on the radio and everything. It is just great!
5,One of the best.,"I think that this song is like a combination of Rap and Pop, very different from the usual music these days."
5,It is about a guy wanting to skate or dance with a girl,Did you know that the lead singer hated this song Every Morning ? Did you know that on the first day the group came in football helmets and only football helmets? I want to know how much this cd cost an dwhere you can get it
5,Catchy tunes!,"""Every Morning"" will have you whistling along and ""Even Though"" is uplifting. This band has talent, and Mark McGrath is a cutie!"
5,"""Every Morning"" is really out there!","The streamlining of Sugar Ray's sound gives the band more body. It's a very good thing in a very big way! ""Fly"" was the precedent and now it's moving."
4,Not bad - if you don't mind riding in a cross-dressing tank.,"Battle Engine Aquilla is a light version of Mechwarrior with a good extra thrown in: Your tank can fly. In the game, you pilot a giant crab-like tank that looks like it is wearing a silver hula-skirt. Although the ""Battle Engine"" looks prissy, it does pack a good deal of power in the form of projectile guns, energy weapons and rockets.Instead of Mech-Warrior style rocket-jumping, the Aquilla can fly for limited periods of time, you have to land and ""recharge"" or else you wind up landing the hard way. I like this feature alot and it makes up for the more simplistic targeting and tank management systems in the game.You could do alot worse with your money."
4,PC games are better because of price dif,"Battle Engine is a lot of fun to play and the feeling of freedom of going from land to air is like a dream. The only wheapons are Pulse cannon, Vulcan cannon and the missles. Thier are a number of glitches such as the computer voice aboard Aquila sometimes changes pitch(bad media component I guess). On character I find quite annoying is That engineer with the fake bulgarian accent, it's horrid(a bit better in game than the movies). Aside from that it's a great game! I got mine with my Falcon Northwest PC. It is actually part of the Asus K8V M/B bundle. If you are going to get this get the PC version, the P/s 2 and other consoles are a big rip at 50 bux. + you get the wonderful voice talants with the PC and that of an Annie Linux look-a-like(or someone trying too hard to look like her) talking with a horrid lispy-sounding germ/something accent. Lowsey acting is better than none any day."
1,UGGggghhhh ...,"This is my third bad buy, so I've learned my lesson, if it's not sax music by well known sax men ... DON'T BUY IT!!! ... All these cuts sound like they were done by the same musicians who did the theme song for ""I Dream of Jeannie ... A better title would be; Midnight Sax for Losers""."
1,Beware: This is not the musical,How many people have bought the wrong tape? There is no image or hint that this is a city tour (nor a hint in the only other review!). I'm not intereseted in a tour of Chicago!
3,partially useful,"have used it less than a handful of times in a few years. when i bought it the description was not detailed enough and being new to fondue - i did not know what i needed. this is only useful/recommended for oils and non-dairy, non-chocolate fondues. no place to buy pieces to make this more versatile. the length of forks is good. it is stable for adults - would not suggest for ages who do not have total coordination. it does go in dishwasher so that is good, just not versatile."
3,Great knives; this one's too short,"Global knives have very thin, stiff blades. They also have comfortable grips that never slip in your hand and give you the proper leverage for each job. They are light and precisely balanced. Although they are expensive, you will never replace them. This knife, however, is too short. Global has a 6"" serrated utility knife that I want."
4,Exactly what I ordered,"It was the exact product I ordered in the correct color. I was a bit surprised at the hollow handle, open ended at the bottom. It did not feel right. I can file the rough edges off and perhaps find a way of storing other items in it when back packing, or adding foam and a cap.The packaging was a bad selection, an envelope that had ripped open. That is not a good choice for an item with a blade. Even a slight padding in the envelope might have protected it more. For it's size, a small box would have been better."
4,8 -inch,"i do like the hatchet, it is very lite, but has a sturdy design that is perfect to carry with you, as far as the 4stars , i wish i had purchased the longer 10-or 12 inch because with the 8 inch its not idea for chopping down a tree, but more for chopping through dead trees for a fire. With such a short handle sometimes you run the risk of missing the mark and hitting your hand on the tree or what your cutting so i would just recommed getting something a little longer. (thats what she said)"
4,Great little Hatchet,"Nice design, very sharp, I use it to cut the sprouts off of the Maple trees and remove part of tree roots so i don't hit them with a lawn mower ... very little effort required because the hatchet is very sharp..."
3,"sturdy, unremarkable","A very sturdy (small!) hatchet to buy for yourself, but plastic molding blemishes make it a cheap feeling thing to buy for someone else."
3,Common Sense Christianity,"Thought provoking, but one is left wondering why not leave the traditional Church for Unitarianism."
1,Crappy Global Knife,This is the dullest Global knife I have ever purchased. This won't peel anything. I'm so sad to have spend good money on such a crappy knife. I have many other Global knives and they are absolutely my favorite but this peeler is dull right out of the box. Don't waste your money buy the Shun bird's beak peeler it's a far superior knife.
3,Review of Homespun Tablecloth,"This item is not as closely woven as I would like. I already have several ""catches"" on the tablecloth."
3,Normal situation.,The front light is common. May be it consume the battery a little faster. The rear light is better. Flashing dazzlingly.
1,Boring but informative to the VERY NEW PAINTER,"First the good stuff:It was very simple to understand. The information was informative. The class was slow enough to actually take notes while not having to stop.BAD STUFF:The instructor was terribly boring. I felt like I was back in 7th grade, 6th period and in study hall. They did not show you very many variations of art materials. The video technology was awful.Overall I thought the content was ok but the video is very much overpriced. They should have charged 1/2 the price."
3,decent liniment especially for the price,Being a practitioner of Muay Thai I bang up my shins pretty bad some times. I like to use this stuff in a similar fashion as Dit Da Jow or Thai liniment and it seems pretty effective. Just the other day I had pretty bad bruising on my right elbow and after using this stuff for a day the bruising magically disappeared. Don't exactly know how this stuff works but it does seem to have a good effect on bruising somehow. I would recommend it for heavy bag work or martial arts conditioning it seems to work good enough.
4,Good product,Got by recommendation of acupuncturist for my husband. He hasn't used it but I have and it is a good product
3,Will not recomend.,"I receveid this product very quickly but it is only temporary relief, and it is not any different from others I have tried."
1,Useless Water,"A waste of money. It is nothing but brown water. I strongly recommend you eliminate this product from your ""catalog."""
4,Why 3x the price of the others?,"Why is #8 three times the price of the others in the series? I've been reading the series on paperback since the 70s and have been missing it since they've stopped publishing new books. Jim Mullany did a great job in taking over the writing.When I started seeing these for $0.99 each I got excited about reading them all over again. If I didn't already have a kindle, I would have bought one just for these books. I hope they continue to release the rest of the series.Also, there are a few books missing, like #5, #9, #10, etc. #11 isn't missing but it's $1.99. If I hadn't read these before, I wouldn't worry about the price. But for books I've already read, $0.99 seems to be the magic number for me."
3,OK But Not Great,"All the Remo Williams books are fun to read, and the price is comparable to renting a movie. Since they are topical for the times, I like trying to figure out which people places and events are the basis for the story."
4,Good shaver,"Good shaver - I have tough spots on my neck that all electric shavers have problems with.....this one is better than other Norelcos and Remingtons that I have owned. I also like the power that I feel when using this razor - it is loud, manly, and I feel like I am accomplishing something! :)"
4,Clean shave,"Great product, but is louder then other shavers. My husband loves it and is very happy with the close clean shave he gets."
3,"Good Shaver, But.....","The Braun gives a good shave, but I found that this model doesn't have the red low-charge light my old model had. Not a major problem, but I miss it."
2,Usually my German buying habits work out well,"I'm not very happy with this shaver....I had an 8+ year old Norelco that worked much better than this one.....I have to go over alot of areas several times to get all the hair, and sometimes I still miss areas around my jawline.As a rule of thumb, I like to buy German products, but this time it didn't work out so well....eventually I'll buy another Norelco most likely."
5,great shaver,"My old Braun stopped working after about 8 years. After buying a Norelco Synchro and trying it out for almost a month, I returned it -- it was awkward to use, did not give a close shave and it would always leave a few short hairs that it refused to cut. Also, I had trouble cutting close to my sideburns and mustache without cutting into them.I bought the Braun 7505. What a huge difference. Even before the Braun was broken in, it was easier to hold, caused less irritation, and shaved closer and more efficiently than a broken-in Norelco. It really was no contest."
4,Typically excellent Braun shaver,"I purchased one of these as a replacement for a Braun 6520 that has served me faithfully for many years. Shaving performance is about the same as for the 6520, although the foil screen design has been ""modernized"" ... perhaps nominally more gentle for the skin. Ergonomically, the 7505 is a tad lighter and feels better in the hand than the 6520. I am happy to see that Braun has maintained product quality with improvements in both design and performance. Followup: I've been using this for over a month now and am happy to report it is bigger advance over the 6520 model than I initially thought. The new foil screen design permits a closer shave with less razor burn. I am very pleased."
4,Solid no frill shaver,"Pro:Good old solid shaver, looks like one, and works like one. Get the job done well.Con:Could use better grade plastics for the body parts. The plastic parts in the shaving head feels scarily fragile, looks very un-German to me.Quite loud. Coming from Norelco 6886XL, it takes me a while to get used to the Braun's high pitch noise.Did I say it's loud?But after tried the new and flimsy Norelcos, I have no choice but to switch to this Braun - it costs more to service my old Norelco 6886XL."
5,Braun 7505 Review,"The shaver is excellent. Was very disappointed, however, in the extremely cheap travel case that now comes with these expensive Braun products. This is my third Braun shaver, and the quality of the case has deteriorated steadily over the past decade or so. My first in 1991 came with a very nice hard case for travel. By 1998 the case had deteriorated to a soft cover zip close case, but still was compartmentalized and adequate for travel. This new shaver came with a garbage case that I was too embarrased to even give to the Salvation Army, and threw it away (it's useless) and am continuing to use the 1998 case which although not the greatest quality, is infinitely better than the junk that came with this shaver. Hopefully the shaver itself doesn't turn out to be constructed as inferiorily compared to the previous models as the case."
5,"Listen up, ladies!","I had been dissatisfied with several shavers, so I did some research. I wanted to know the difference between men's and women's razors. I read that men's are better-suited to coarser hair. Well, my leg hair is coarse enough to be a man's beard, so I got a men's shaver. This thing works! If I shave my legs right after I get out of the shower (after drying off), my legs are just as smooth for just as long as with a standard razor. And even completely dry, I get a smooth shave. It's a great legs razor."
4,Hafdis is most entertaining and a great icelandic wonder.,Hafdis Huld is an award winning songbird from Iceland who has a wonderful voice and muse. She uses folk instruments fused with electronic to make songs that are fun and filled with hooks. She plies her talents between her homeland and Western Europe where she has quite a following.
3,"good read, but a little slow","This is a good book that provides certainly all the elements of a thriller. However, I found the middle part of the book a slow read and found myself fast-forwarding through some sections. The ending is much better, bringing things to a climactic end. The book would have benefited by a reduction in the number of characters as well. I found that it was difficult to place all the characters in the storylines they were involved in, especially when double names were introduced for some of the characters.That being said, the basic storyline is exciting and provided a good backbone for this book."
5,Great book! You will not be able to put if down.,I would love to find another copy to share with others. Velma's life story changed my thinking toward people who are prescription drup abusers. I will never be the same. Everyone needs to read it.
4,Is Redemption Possible?,"That's the question this book made me ask. Velma Barfield's case reminded me a great deal of the heavily publicized lead-up to the execution of Karla Faye Tucker of Texas who admitted her crimes, and by all outward appearances reformed, (found religion) but it was not enough to save her life.Velma or ""Mama Margie"" fully blames the pills that she was addicted to for her actions. She glosses over her crimes, blaming her hazy drug-blurred memory. Her victims are never characterized as anything more than irritating alcoholics, or overbearing elderly crones who demanded too much from her. We don't get any sense of their suffering or pain. She wants us to believe that there was no premeditation or really much thought at all given to the murders.Overall the book is very well written but left me scratching my head, I was hoping to get a look inside a killer's mind, but I came away with very little insight."
3,Granny & Velma,"My grandmother grew up with Velma. Unfortunately, she passed away last year. I had always heard her speak of Velma and purchased this book to learn more. In my grandmother's last days she had a bit of dimensia from the drugs she was given, (mainly an allergic reaction to steroids, but anyway) I arrived at the hospital one day and she told me Velma had come to visit her and had been ""sittin in that chair."" My grandmother was somewhat rattled by this, & after reading this book I can see why!I was hoping this book would be a biography, it is more of a book full of excuses for horrible atrocities. Prescription drugs or no prescription drugs, she conned and murdered anyone that seems to trust her. Family and friends were her target - it's disgusting! I found it VERY difficult to sympathize with the woman. I was rather disappointed."
3,tragic story,"this womans life story was sad and gripping in many ways. its told in a straight forward and frank manner. but the fact remains is that she killed many people in cold blood and deserves to die. the story focuses on aspects of her life, the murders and her religous beliefs. she may have grown up in an unhappy household, been addicted to painkillers, or had an unfulling life. but this does not give you the right to take another life. woman murderers are not so common so if you are looking for a different kind of story, this will be a good one for you."
1,"Bright Blue with ""PHILIPS"" in big white letters","Like the previous reviewer said, what you get is nothing like what is pictured.It's a lanyard, but it's bright blue with big white lettering with the word ""PHILIPS"" on it. It's quite annoying and you'll look like a dork wearing it.Not happy."
1,PJ,The product received was TOTALLY different from featured photo. The product received had huge lettering on it and was a bright color. I was very deceived since the product details did not mention the possibly of a substitute. The one star is for the product at least being a neck strap!
1,Rip Off,"The game is to ""click"",that is it requires to many steps per event, and thats very distracting.The program does not work when trying to raid other merchants,just allows pirates to defeat youbefore you have a chance to respond.Old tech graphics, poor programing in all areas of the game.I'm very disappointed with this game, and disposed of it promptly."
1,If I have the choice...,"I would have given the seller ""Bargain Buyers Software"" negative 5 stars.1. this is bootleg, do not buy from Bargain Buyers Software. No wonder he sold it for so cheap? $0.99??2. this game is not playable with win XP. I think the reason is because it is a bootleg.BAD seller!!"
5,Dreams of You,"I loved this book. Felt the frustration of both people. Couldn't figure out who was trying to kill her, and was really surprised at the end. Had a great understanding of the homeless, there where times where I held my breath, and was so afraid for the people. This is one of my favorite books. Kept wanting to read the last page to see how it turned out, but didn't want to spoil it. Total surprise at the end. Great book"
4,Read before you buy,"First off, be extremely cautious reading the reviews entitled ""Dreams of You"" and ""On the Way to Heaven."" Those are not reviews for this book and should not be under this title. They are reviews for other Tina Wainscott books. Furthermore, what Harriet Klausner writes is all mentioned in the first chapter so she isn't giving anything away in her summary. It is in fact what the story is all about.As for the book itself, I enjoyed the characters, felt the draw they had for one another but the suspense was minimal. It is in the true sense of a contemporary romance, but not a lot of sex. Saying that it is a romance, you have to be ready to accept things that would never actually occur in real life, but I can not go into those examples in fear of spoiling it for the reader. The moral of the story is great and worth reading for that point. Other than that, I just don't feel it is worth the money."
4,Enjoyable Read,"A good solid read with an interesting plot, believable characters and realistic dialog. Has a sprinkling of para-normal activity, but nothing too outlandish.The story revolves around the character of Chloe, who after being hit by a car, makes a psychic connection with a lost little boy. Chloe must convince the boy grieving father, her slightly bizarre family, and the public in general that what she is sensing is real."
2,"nice, familiar text, horrible synthesizer music","received this as a gift and was delighted to see many old favorite songs in the set. HOWEVER, there are no ""real"" instruments, it is all set to computer synthesizer music. Drove me crazy. Gave to Goodwill."
1,.Never Again,Not what it claimed to be and the person selling it did not get back to me and make good on the purchase
3,No Hook Keeper????,"I got the 9', 4-piece, 5-weight. It's a beautiful, lightweight rod, one that I can cast all day. The cork is high quality and the reel seats' hardware and finish are top notch. I did overload it and am actually casting a Type IV 6-weight SA Wet Cel sink line in local lakes. The rod handles this line effortlessly, as though they were designed for one another. 60-70' casts are no problem. Rod came with a nice tube and sock, a great added touch. My only complaint, and this is a big one, is that it does not have a hook keeper! Are you kidding me? All the effort they put into making this beautiful rod and including a case, and they can't mount a hook keeper. In fact, I've never seen a fly rod without one! Very disappointing!"
2,Essick Air #4D7300 LT Oak VS Humidifier,"Works OK, Noisy on higher settings, Flimsy,Bottles hard to fill, No indicator light to let you know it is out of water. Humidity gauge is nice"
3,humidifier,"bought this item because of las vegas nv dry weather. the unit is supposed to humidify the whole home. with the blower on full speed to do that you would have to hide the unit in the garage and duct the air in because it is so loud. even at speed 1 (it has 9 speeds)it is louder than the floor stand fan i use to help it circulate the humidity. on occasion one refill bottle will empty and it doen't switch over to the other bottle and completely dries out the wick and the humidity drops dramatically. the caps that release the water from the bottles to the wick have a tendency to leak when you refill them so you have to be quick when putting them back into the unit or you will get water dripping on anything in their path which includes the control panel. when working properly it does a good job, but boy the manufacture does need better quality control."
2,"Doesn't work well, ugly and loud","I was so hopeful because our house is so Dry! It arrived and my first thought was wow, should not have gone with the wood panel option. UGLY. But, I filled it up and put it in a corner behind a chair. We have a really nice digital weather station that monitors the humidity of the house. It went up about 2% after running an entire day. The unit said it went up over 15%. It is SOOOOO loud, even on the lowest setting. And it has a horrible clicking sound. I tried all sorts of ways to adjust it to alleviate it but the clicking sound is awful. It seems incredibly cheap. Sending it back and going with another Pure Guardian."
5,Replaced my ten-year model with another,"We've used the predecessor model for over ten years and liked it so much we opted to replace it with a new one. We had no negative issues with the old unit and, after purchasing a new filter annually, it adequately served our 3,000 sq. ft. home each winter."
2,loud,"We are using this in the entry hall of our house near the intake for the furnace. It is very convenient to fill (2 containers, 1 on either side), and you do not have the problem of mold building on the inside of the unit like the older canister humidifiers. However, I would not recommend this product if you have a problem with loud appliances. It turns on and off frequently and the lowest fan setting is still quite loud."
1,"Not the Indo-Tibetan Master, Kamalashila","Bit disappointed that Mr. Mathews book is NOT ""The Sages of Meditation"" by the great Indian/Tibetan Master Kamalashila. I guess I should have read the customer reviews - but it seems that if you are going to take the name of a great historical figure who wrote specific root texts on meditation that it should be made a little clearer who actually wrote the book and its title should more clearly destinguish it from the original work. I am sure the author was not intentionally deceptive and I do not mean to be harsh, but to prevent similar purchasing mistakes."
4,"Great ""best of""","This is a great album but I wouldn't recommend buying it. This album has a great assortment of songs which show off many of their older sides, but do not weave the wonderful stories their other complete albums do. I'd recommend buying either ""It's a Jungle..."" or ""Shack man"" and listen to it from start to finish a couple dozen times. Those are amazing experiences. Once you listen to those two, you will buy the rest of their music, and then have no need for this ""greatest hits album."""
5,insane sounds,"I just bought this CD at the concert i went to last night. I love this music. The reason i gave this a five instead of a four is because, although this CD isnt as good as live, i still can't get over last night, it was so amazing, i couldnt help laughing the whole time."
1,Who is the psycho who gave these guys a contract?,listen to this only if you're in need of a soundtrak for underwater alien observation or you're trying to drive someone crazy. This band (using that term loosely) sounds like a combination of people who've forgotten how to play their instruments and Dead Heads with nothing else to do. It is simply the worst thing I've ever heard. I saw them last night live and they were even worse in person.
5,Frankie,"I'd forgotten that I don't really care for Albums recorded live,and this was no different. I gave it to my Boy Friend, NO PROBLEM..."
2,CDs - songs,"Received product in good time. Like this CD. But the other CD received was cracked. Emailed for help, but got no response (over a month now). Not sure if I'd buy from them again."
1,"BOO, HISS! I HATE THE 4 SEASONS!","I can't stand the 4 Seasons. Frankie Valli sounds like a permanent choirboy (a castrado) and his ghastly voice would shatter glass for miles. ""Dawn"" is bar none the worst song he has ever done. ""You're Too Good to be True"" is truly punishment for the ears. His voice makes my ponytail stand on end and ties my nerves in knots. I hope I am never exposed to their atrocious sounds ever! I HATE THE 4 SEASONS!"""
2,ouch!,Not what I thought it was going to be. Several songs that weren't their best. The sound system wasn't too good either.
1,the 20 greatest hits of Frankie Valli &the 4 Seasons,Very disappointed in this . It was like being at a concert where you just hear the crowd and can bearly here the music.
5,G R E A T,"GREAT! Beautifull made and an icon in music history. I got the album in the seventies, lost it and refound it again. Now I'm treasuring it as one of the precious gems ...on vinyl. I had an mp3 made from the vinyl album, but a CD was never in my possesion until ...now! Again: GREAT!"
2,bought at costco- doesn't work well,"the rings open up too easily an then after not long, they don't even close correctly."
1,cheap for a reason,Our kids are required to use binders for school. We have already been through 2 sets of these binders it is worth it to spend a little more for a better binder these fall apart quickly and are not good for everyday use.
1,WOW,"So, I bought this for couponing. I thought it would be sturdy enough but cheap enough that I could use it. It sucked from day two. The first thing that happened was that the rings that clasp together inside to hold your papers, or whatever, wouldn't hold. They kept staying just a little bit open, enough to dump everything out if I wasn't careful.After a few days of that, the black plastic began to peel off. Now, I wasn't handling this thing roughly or anything, I just had coupons in it, and not thousands of them or anything. Then, after about 2 weeks, the thing just literally fell apart.I couldn't believe it, honestly. Horrible product."
4,decent,"These do all right for what I want them to. Yes, I have used better, but they are all right. I do not use them for business purposes, so I am less concerned about durability and more concerned about just having a place to put the things I print without unceremoniously dumping the items in a two pocket folder. I do end up printing stuff that is 35+ pages, and can use this for multiple printings."
4,My favourite watch,"I got this one 4 years ago. I own 9 watches, quartz and mechanical and kinetic, all costing far more than this one, but for some reason I like this one the best.The stop second hand started resetting to 5 seconds past the hour about 15 minutes after I bought it. Thats a problem to get fixed from my past experience with other quartz watches I've owned, but it doesn't affect the overall accuracy of the watch, so I never bothered sending it back under the warranty to get that fixed. The leather strap fell apart about a year after I bought it and I replaced it with a rubber one.Otherwise, I've had really good luck with this watch. I always take it with me when I'm travelling because it's so comfortable. The glass has remained scratch free and for some reason it's still going strong with the original battery. It's just a good looking, light weight, comfortable & very accurate watch."
5,harp CD,"Since I had the Mystic Harp and loved it, I HAD to also have the 2nd edition. These are beautiful ""healing harp"" renditions. The builder of these harps does an excellent job as does the artist playing on it."
4,Received the wrong c.d.,"I received the c.d. ""Mystic Harp"", not ""Mystic Harp, Vol. 2"".I ordered ""Mystic Harp"" also, and received it from another supplier.So, now I have two copies of ""Mystic Harp""I contacted the supplier who sent the wrong one. They e-mailed me back, saying for me to send the one back for an exchange. However, I just decided to keep it.Thank you."
3,Study Guide has Mistakes,"Overall, I think this study guide is helpful but be aware, it contains some small and not so small errors. It's almost as if the publication wasn't edited before going into print. Mistakes range from misspelled words (not so serious) to errors on the practice test answer sheet (fairly serious) Being educational material you would expect more but overall, it serves the purpose of helping prepare you for a real test."
1,Not what it's cracked up to be!,"I bought two of these sets for my daughters for Christmas and am returning both of them. I am a veteran of the 70's fondue craze so I have had experience making all kinds of fondue. This set is only suitable for meat/fish. For cheese fondue, a ceramic flameproof pot is necessary - the stainless steel will be too hot. For chocolate fondue, a water bath under the chocolate is necessary. Also, the burner does not hold a standard sized Sterno - the lid will not fit on over the Sterno so there is no way to adjust the heat. My daughter invited friends for New Year's Eve for fondue and they ended up using my retro copper set with the water bath underneath for chocolate fondue and a Corning Wear French White Casserole on the stand for Cheese."
4,Pretty good Buffy book,"Obsidian Fate was a pretty good book. Joss Whedon and company could have turned the story of the book into a really good two-part episode. But, Diana Gallager's wouldn't have. The book lacked action and good dialogue.But overall, it was OK."
3,A good time waster,"Despite some of the fairly negative comments from other reviewers, I enjoyed this book. The plot's a little flimsy, and Gallagher can overwrite just a wee tad. But on the positive side, Gallagher shows every sign of actually having watched the TV series and of having some knowledge of the characters she's supposed to be writing about (unlike some other Buffy authors). She's very good at capturing Buffy, Angel and Giles, and her Cordelia -- despite having somehow slipped back into first series le bitche grande mode -- is a high point. Her Willow is not as good. (It's strange how Buffy novelists have so much trouble capturing the wily Willow charms. Perhaps it's because Willow, more than any other character, really needs Alyson Hannigan's flittery speech patterns to bring her fully to life.) I'm unlikely to read this again, but it did pass a quiet Sunday afternoon very pleasantly indeed."
3,Wasted opportunity,"It was a wasted opportunity as a Buffy novel as many of the elements of the story were actually very interesting.The story line has some elements of the Inca Mummy girl, in that it used South American mythology which is a nice change from the usual, Hellmouth demon / vampire story, most other writers do.I liked the inclusion of Mr Trick, the Mayor and Joyce - Buffy's mother, their characters were very close to those of the actors on the show. I also enjoyed the major role Buffy's mother played in the storyline.All the dramatic parts were in place but none of the fun, like pop culture references, the dialog between the main characters was especially lacking in energy.Overall not a bad book but not really as much fun as it should have been."
1,A very disappointing read...,"If you haven't bought Obsidian Fate yet, save your money. This book was THE worst BTVS book I have read thus far. The characterization was off, the editing was bad, and it was obvious that the author isn't a fan of the series. Stick to The Gatekeeper Trilogy, it's a vastly better read."
2,It had potential BUT fell short,"Obsidian Fate could have been a very good Buffy book. The Aztec culture and mythology made an interesting setting for the story. However, this book falls short of being on par with the books written by Christopher Golden, and Nancy Holder. First there's the annoying mistake of Angelus being referred to as Angeles. Second Oz's band is named Dingoes Ate My Baby, not Dingoes Ate Your Baby. Third, it took forever for the story to get interesting. I read over half of the book before the story finally picked up the pace. Skip this one and buy the Golden, Holder books."
1,Awful! Worst Buffy book ever!,"I have read all of the Buffy novels so far, and I'm sorry to say that this is, without a doubt, the worst of them. Usually I have to fight to put them down. This one I had to fight to keep picking up.The author is obviously not very familiar with the characters, and it shows in how unconvincingly they and their descriptions come across. I couldn't believe it when she repeatedly referred to Angel's vampire persona as ""Angeles"" -- I'm also shocked that the editor (assuming there was one) didn't catch that.The worst thing about this book, however, is the author's infatuation with run-on sentences and adjective-heavy descriptions of everyone and everything. This adds to the unconvincing portrayal of the characters and makes the book unnecessarily difficult to get through.There are a lot of Buffy novels set to release in the next few months. If you're going to skip one, this is the one you probably won't miss."
2,Could have been *much* better.,"What was *up* with the characters?! 'Cause, you know, those aren't the ones I watch every week. The ending was...interesting...but incredibly lame. Just like everybody else is saying - Holder and Golden do the best job of any Buffy series writer - read their stuff, they know what they're talking about."
2,Could have been the best Buffy novel -- but it isn't,"A book with an interesting premise and some clever writing that could have been the best Buffy novel to date, but that ultimately misses the boat. The Aztec god plot is interesting, and some of the characterizations of regular characters are good, but the use of Angeles for Angelus is extremely distracting, and the most important character -- Buffy -- fails to convince. Not a total waste of time, but not the greatest read either."
4,Reality Check Review,"Peter finally discovers that he is in love with his best friend, Jenna. He is forever trying throughout this book to tell her, but is crushed when he gets the wrong idea about Jenna and Miguel.Nicole is out to wreak revenge on Jesse for dumping her. She decides to enter a modeling contest, but is dreaming of winning even before it starts.Jenna is at a family civil war with her roommate Maggie. Maggie dumps her unmentionables in the floor; Jenna hangs them out the window. Maggie puts up weird-looking posters; Jenna puts up a room divider. Jenna insults Maggie's school dance date and dress; Maggie puts a picture of Jenna on the Internet--and a rather embarrassing one to boot. Jenna tells her parents and Maggie is grounded."
3,Get the other one instead,"I love Kitty Pippen's first book, Quilting with Japanese Fabrics. This book is nice, but I don't think it covers a lot of new territory. If you can buy both her books, great, but if you can only buy one, I'd recommend the other one over this."
5,Asian Elegance: Quilting With Japanese Fabrics and More (That Patchwork Place) (,The book is everything I had hoped for and more. Wonderful patterns w/clear and concise instructions are very important and this book has both. I would strongly recommend this selection for beginning to advanced quilters; there is something for all skill levels in this book .... even art quilters will enjoy this one!
2,"Agreement with ""get the other one"" review","I found this book less rich (too basic) than I had hoped for. Not overly inspiring, but OK. This book emphasizes Hawaii rather than Asia. I prefer the book by Kitty Pippen."
2,Struggling,"Sorry struggling with this story find it boring. The plot started off well, the romance takes place within days (rolls eyes). Sorry not the best in the early series, totally unbelievable."
4,Excellent !!,"I absolutely loved this book as the continuation to the Coles, Sterlings, and the Kirklands stories.However, in reference to ""Heaven Sent'' I didn't really care for the ending because of Regina's marriage to a man who is some fifty-odd years older than her tender age of ninteen."
5,HOMECOMING,I READ HOMECOMING AND RENEGADE COULD NOT PUT THESE BOOK DOWNI REALLY HAVE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE COLE FAMILY.AS YOU READIT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE SITTING AND THE MOVIES AND IT BEING PLAY OUT ON THE BIG SCREEN THE LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN THE COLE MEN AND THEIR WOMEN ARE A ONCE AND A LIFE TIME LOVE. WHICH EVERY FEMALE WOULD DIE FOR.ROCHELLE ALERS IS A VERY GIFTED AND BLESSWRITER HER WORK SHOULD BE ON THE BIG SCREEN.
3,mike s.,these guys are ok. the beats are very average to weak and i am sorry but these guys are just avverage lyracists... they do present a good message though... FOR REAL LYRACISM AND TRULY GREAT GOSPEL HIP HOP MUSIC PEEP FLEXX... HIS NEW ALBUM GOD IS ON MY SIDE IS AN INSTANT CLASSIC... GO TO CDBABY
3,Global quality but some problems,I bought this on a whim to finish my global collection.Quality is the same as all global knives but I agree with previous reviewer that the handle is too flat which make it awkward to use.If the handle had more heft it would have been a great paring knife. Global skimped on this knife
2,Sure would have been nice if they'd shipped the one pictured.,"I love my Global knives! In particular, the one pictured in this listing. I have one of these great little knives, and wanted another. Searched high and low because it seems Global ""improved"" their paring knife and added a nasty little notch to the blade that always cuts my finger. I was so excited to find this one listed! Imagine my disappointment to open the box and find the wrong knife. I've no desire to pay return shipping and will just toss this one in the drawer with the one I have just like it. If anybody finds one like the one in the picture, I hope they'll let me know."
5,Great knife,Easy to sharpen and great size for fileting meat. Use this knife alot and it continues to be a favorite.
5,Cute Purse,This is the closest my little one is coming to a pet in awhile. on 4 years old. So if she takes care of it we will get her a cat. She loves the purse and sleeps with the cat. Overall cool concept but the purse should of been a little bit bigger.
5,Great for How Short it is.,"It does leave out some detail from the book. That is to be expected from a 1400+ book made into a three hour book on CD. However, for being as short as it is, it does a great job of getting accross most of the ideas from the book. Les Meserables is an incredible book. Everyone should read or listen to it."
2,Doesn't Depict the True Story,"I've read the unabridged version of Les Miserables at least five times. It is a wonderful masterpiece that hasn't been beat by any book I've read besides. Now, I love audio books, and I know that audio books have to abridge the novels that are so long. I don't mind that. But this audio totally changes the whole story. If someone hasn't read the book, they would get a total misrepresentation of the characters. I don't think they could even understand the true nature of any of the characters. It is an interesting audio, but misleading, and no where's near the masterpiece of the novel."
4,Les Miserable - Radio Drama,"A very good dramatization of the book by fine British actors. I read the book, I think, years ago; seen the movies, and watch the musical. It was pleasure."
4,wow oh wow!,"Focus on the Family Radio Theatre and Tyndale House Publishers have DONE IT AGAIN! Having a limited idea of Les Mis' plot, I had expected to be slightly confused with only my ears to follow the tale but I had NO PROBLEMS following the storyline and I didn't I find my mind wandering.The actors were quite talented in sounding young, old, ill, excited and all the other various emotions included in the plot! I loved the use of sounds like fire crackling and horse's hooves. In fact, it was so realistic that, at one point, I pulled my ear buds out of my ears to find out what the sound was... It was nothing but the grandfather clock TICKING during the drama!I LOVED IT! I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SHARING IT WITH MY FAMILY ON OUR NEXT ROAD TRIP!"
4,Fun little gem!,"Cara Adams's world has taken a spin toward disaster. Mark ""the Shark"" Morgan -- the man who made her law school years a living hell -- has joined the firm she has painstakingly tried to make partner for six years. To make matters worse, Mark, with his New York contacts and credentials, is a bigger shoo-in for the aforementioned position. What's the girl to do? Not fall in love with the Shark... right? Things would be so different if the gods would grant her a do-over...This is another fun installment from Harlequin Flipside. It is a lighthearted, hip and witty romantic gem! I recommend this wonderful effort to those who love romantic comedies."
3,"Sorry, Poi, this just isn't up to your usual high standards","I'm a big Poi fan. I've been a big Poi fan since I saw them 10 years ago. So of course I snapped this up as soon as I could. What a disappointment! Other than ""Jealous,"" which is pure Poi pleasure, this album totally lacks the infectious groove thang that's kept me coming back year after year. In fact, it's a mushy pseudo-disco mess. What happened after Pomegranate, their best album so far? Wake up, Frank, we need you!"
2,disapointing,"PDP are one of my top 3 favourite bands. Perhaps I now ought to say `were'. Natural Thing is beautifuly produced. The ensemble playing is flawless, the sound is pure but luxuriant. The substance underneath this polish is spongey though. Natural Thing is sterile. There are plenty of pleasant moments, but its music to blend with your pastel wallpaper, to have as background music at a business presentation. I confess that I miss the Poi that was....."
3,Research source,Used as research item. A bit sketchy but adequate to support my needs There were a lot more available facts that could have been brought out.
5,pyramid subwoofers,"these subwoofers are great.they replaced 100w speakers, but are easily driven by my amp.they sound excellent thru the whole volume range.i highly recommend them."
1,Just sounds,I was very dissappointed with this tape. You have to turn the volume way up to heat the gulls and the waves sounded like a car motor. I won 't even use it.
2,um no,"what can we do to make a really exciting film? well, people like batman, so lets put in a little of that. hey, people think that darth maul was cool too, so lets put a little of that too......i give two thumbs up...to manon des springs and cyrano...but gerard doing a back kick? no. the visuals were very nice, but having an intense visual one right after each nanosecond just gives me a headache."
1,Pure Junk,"This DVD is not worth watching. I am saving the DVD for the next time I go shooting, it is the target."
1,A Lost Art,"It seems as though crafting a good knife at a fair price is a lost art. While these knives are forged as advertised (with the exception of the steak knives), I doubt that they are truly made of stainless steel. On the box it indicates that the knives are dishwasher safe, but after the first wash they have rusted. I am sorely disappointed, as I had expected more from Farberware."
3,OK for the money,"There are better certainly knives available but, for the price, this set is more than adequate. The knives were not very sharp out of the box but that was cured by a few minutes with a stone. The blades seem to hold their edges well and that is an important consideration for me.The sharpening steel is more coarse than I prefer but my old steel fits the knife block so it's not a problem.These knives will rust if they are not dried after washing.If you can afford to spend more, you'll probably be happier with a better set than this."
4,"Good for the price, can be uncomfortable to wear","I bought this in hopes of wearing it on my watchband, but some of the edge poke can be felt after wearing it for a while. However, I wear my watch tight, and by band is wide and thick plastic. The compass itself is great,much better than the cheap compasses like those on match containers and the like. I have mine on a lanyard attached to a Sog Revolver. The luminous bezel is great too. It makes a great backup compass."
3,Fair compass,Not a big issue since you shouldn't be navigating with this compass but it was a little off magnetic north compared with a higher end compass and city street guides. Should do the job for basic orientation when arriving by train in some of those strange countries.
3,its ok for the price,"not a bad little compass, moves a bit slow when your turning it, but then I didn't really expect much for what I paid."
3,"Interesting, but suspicious","Master Con Man is vanity publishing in its infancy. It isn't easy to gain a sense of what Gottfried really is up to -- but there is a certain sense that the story is missing something. First, the narrative is pretty compelling. Gottfried details some imaginative capers and certainly invites understanding of the workings of the scam. That said, the book is neither terribly well-written or well-edited. There's a spin on here, and it is designed to make a case for something (redemption? self-justification? pity?), but the reader can't be sure what. It's also not for the squeamish. A fair read, but not compelling literature."
5,Incredible,"Incredible, incredible but there the cons are supported by evidence, or at least some of them are. Really enjoyed this book and once I started reading I could not put it down. Brings out the crook in me as it makes me want to try some of the cons out, but I don't think I will!"
5,the best so far,"i have heard many versions of the symphony , this is the best version so far.especially the third movement of the symphony- the poco allegretto, it is just perfect !"
3,a decent chapbook,"This short chapbook with the long title comes as a reprint to a 1950 piece published in the North Dakota History journal. 19 pages. Stuffed full of photos, maps, and charts on the Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park. Written by Wilson Laird who served as State Geologist. Interesting bit of history and geology."
3,Not as pictured,"I bought this pump thinking it was an exact replacement. It is not. The picture shown is on target, but what's inside the box is different than the one shown. The base on the new one is rubber, and the mounting hole pattern is not the same. I tried to switch bases, but the hole pattern is different there as well.So, if you're expecting a drop in replacement, forget about it.The good news is, it works. That's the point anyway."
5,Perfect replacement for Shurflo 200-210-39,"I bought this to replace what I believe to be the factory installed water pump in my 1985 Holiday Rambler camper that I bought for a steal of a deal off CL. The old Shurflo 200-210-39 was fried, and this one was the perfect fit replacement. One wire to ground...other wire to the switched +12V wire from the water pump switch, and VOILA perfect water pressure throughout the RV. None of the more expensive Shurflo pumps are really necessary...just buy this one!"
5,perfect fit,this was a perfect replacement pump for my twenty year old camper. but with the added features of 1 is allot quieter than the old one and 2 if you run it dry it won't damage the pump. its been in service for three months and no problems yet
1,"the ""Amazon"" purchase","I've not made purchases at Amazon that I can recall right off, but this one was unsettling at best.My purchase was never acknowledged; I had to log in to find out that ""it will ship soon"" leaving me feel that whomever would do so when ""they"" were in the mood.It did eventually arrive. As for the product, well, it's a water pump. My purchase was as a back up since my current unit is beginning to loose it's back-check valve. I've not installed it to-date, simply waiting until that anticipated day that mine no longer pumps water. Sure-flo pumps have always worked and I have no anticipation this one will be a problem.Karl here ..."
3,First one would not hold pressure,"Shurflo typically makes a decent pump. The first replacement pump would not hold pressure, but the replacement seemed to work just fine"
5,Replacing a 1986 Shurflow with this newer model,"Although this pump is a little different on the black pump end it hooked up the same as my old (and I mean old) pump,a Shurflo 300-310-39 that came with my 1986 Citation trailer.The pump is mounted under the bed next to the water tank and taking the mattress of the bed and two screws to gain EASY access that was the hardest part of the job replacing the pump. Undue the two water lines and two wires and install new pump.I think the whole job took about 20 min. I think anyone could do this job depending on how your water lines hook up to the pump, mine is just a nut on each side. It also works great.Jack"
5,Shurflo water pump purchased from Amazon,"Received fast and packeged very good. Installed in minutes works better and quieter then the one I had., I will shop Amazon again."
5,pump,The product works great. Easy to install. Started pumping water instantly. Cycles on and off as needed.
5,RV water pump.,The price of the water pump was quite competive with other suppliers.It arrived slightly ahead of the estimated time. It was in perfectcondition. I could not ask for more.L. Kite
2,pump review,"pump is noisy ,vibrates,also have problems with switch not coming on,but I guess for the price what more can you expect"
1,Not the right Model number here.,"This description is wrong! This is not the 12V model! check the Shurflo web-site and you will see. This is the 13.7VDC model, whatever that is. I ordered it installed it and it didn't work on my 12V system. Then I read the box...duhh. If you want the 12V you need the 2088-453-444. Or you can waste your time waiting for it, installing it, then end up returning it like me. Good luck."
2,Kitchen range Hood Duct kit,"The kit is ok, but incomplete, and the outlet is of dubious quality. I could not use the outlet portion as the flap would not close completely. Further, it had nothing to stop small animals from crawling inside. Since I live in a heavily wooded area, this is a real problem with squirrels, and the outlet that I purchased seperately has a heavy 'screen' to keep small animals out, and the flap actually closes."
5,Anyone who wants to understand US history needs this book,When whites arrived on this continent they found it populated by countless tribes of residents. During the centuries that followed those tribes mostly vanished. The white conquest of North America is a story of migration and extermination. It is the microcosm of human history everywhere. The Wilbarger book is a series of accounts of the turmoil on the front lines of human encounter. The Wilbarger book is a study of understanding of the minds of men involved in conquest and an illustration of the desparate responses of the (savage)peoples being overrun and exterminated.
5,Excellent book for first hand acounts of Indian attacks.,"This book, though written by a person who obviously hated Indian, was an excellent book for anyone interested in Texas history. I particularly like how the stories are indexed by county so that one may quickly find stories relating to local history as well. This book is not only fascinating from a narrative perspective but also from the fact that it contains photos of settlers who are chronicled in the stories, adding yet another dimension to the books authenticity. I highly recommend this book to parents who are trying to get their children to read (middleschool level). The book reads like a series of short adventure stories. I feel that teens would find this highly engaging especially since the stories are true, even though reported by a biased observer, Wilbarger."
5,Love it!,It is the best knife for everyday usage. I love it. I am currently looking forward to buy another Global knife - this time for vegetable chopping.
3,Good but pricey,"I purchased this Global knife after seeing that Anthony Bourdain recommended Global brand knives.I chose this size because [1] I'm an amateur cook with skinny hands and [2] because it's half the price of Global's other knives.I'm happy with the blade and it's comfortable in my hands. However, it simply doesn't feel like it's worth $50. Global's water sharpener will make it easy to care for this blade, but I just can't rationalize buying another Global knife when Forschner knives are so much cheaper.In fact, I have 2 Forschner knives sitting in my cart for future purchase.I must say, however, that this knife has met my needs. Owning it has made me cook fresh food more often--difficult for a single college student--and it has made prep much easier."
1,not worth it!,"The vcr works fine, but the dvd player didn't work from day 1. It plays for a minute or two, then freezes. I brought it to a repair center and the tech told me it was the 4th one he took in during the past month. The toll free# is 800-311-9263."
1,bad music,Having played industrial and synthesizer mujsic sice I was 5 years of age I music say this CD is really dreadful.Of course it sounds peaceful - that's one synthesizer button. Of course it sounds inthralling - that's another button.Fact is there's no heart whatsoever here and it's ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE EVEN BY THE SAME ARTIST.i dislike to shatter your dreams but this music is [...]
4,Great Lewis,"Kingsblood Royal is largely successful at what it attempts. The reason I didn't give it five stars is because there are a few one dimensional characters in it. Though Lewis tries for complexity in his African American characters, in a few of them, he misses the mark. And occasionally the book suffers from that ""can't we all just get along"" ness that enlightened Caucasians can't help but aim for in books like these. Overall, though, the book is a great success. What struck me time and time again, was the rage with which this nation has demonstrated its belief in the resolute inferiority of black African genes. That having only 1/32nd black African ancestry could cause people to view you entirely differently, proves the potency of the belief that one drop of identifiable black African blood, poisons the entire pool. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks to really understand the racial craziness of America."
4,King's Blood or Tainted Blood?,"The most striking thing about this book by Lewis is how prevalent the prejudices are today that he wrote about in 1947. It is also striking that it took so long to begin to overcome the discriminations then with appropriate laws. Finally, it is discouraging how long it took for the ideas implied by Lewis to be added to the moral force of the nation. I wonder how the book was received when it was first published and what impact it had on desegration and civil rights laws. This is my third Sinclair Lewis book- others were Main Street and Babbitt- and I admire him all the more after reading Kingsblood Royal.What great people hail from Minnesota: Lewis and Garrison Keillor!"
2,One for three,"I bought these as gifts for some buddies of mine, order early to make sure I could get three. Needless to say one of the three snapped while casting. Now I can't get a full refund because it's been over 60 days. I'm paying the price for ordering early."
3,Good Value,"I purchased this rod/reel combo for the convenience of having an outfit that would fit inside my checked baggage when I travel on airlines. The initial performance was good; I used it to catch a dozen or so rainbow trout while fishing in the Donner Lake region of California. The padded bag survived the trip quite well, and storage is more than adequate. The only flaw I encountered was some loosening of the rod sections after several casts. If you don't pause to push everything in tightly periodically, the rod tip (or even the whole rod) will separate and get flung into the lake with your lure."
3,No quick assembly,"Don't plan on whipping this out of the case in a hurry and dipping your hook in the water. It takes some setup and tear-down time, as it does not easily come apart to fit in the case with the reel attached and the line strung. Look somewhere else if you want a quick solution for back country fishing where compact is key. To its credit, the rod has nice action and the reel seems well built. Comes with no line and only one spool. It is not telescopic."
2,brass tacks is all,"This came in for our Bug out bag, and I am glad that I looked it over and put it together as in its case it looks like it is a whole unit. This does not come with any hooks, or tidbits. Also the reel is empty, you have to load it with your own line. This would be a big no- no for those who put it in their BOB or their camping gear expecting to use it when the time comes. I was expecting better."
3,delay,I was very disapointed with the shippers because i had ordered the product with enough time to get it before going away to my fishing vacation but then a few days later they canceled it so now i have to spend an extra 15 dollars to get it in time for my vacation very disapionting amazon very disapointing
5,Exactly what I was looking for...,This item was exactly what I was looking for. I was not sure about the quality but it turns out its very solid - but if you do purchase make sure you put the poll together tightly... then magic.
4,not knowing a thing about fishing rods..,"purchased this for my husband- we moved to a water city. This item is packed really nicely in a case, very efficient which I love. He says the reels feel really good (his fishing experience is some). This is a great item to have for the not so seriou fisherman whic wants to get out there with little fuss but wants a good quality product. Comes with a little case for the bait hooks etc. Very light."
3,Okuma reel,"My husband loves this reel. Even though the rod is too long for him to use in the creeks because of the brush, he put the reel on a shorter rod (Shakespeare) and he is very happy with that."
2,Received a cracked rod - Garbage Quality Control.,"I just packaged my rod for return to Amazon. Glad that i opened it to check the rod before travelling - upon flexing i could clearly see a crack in the ""second from tip"" shaft - overall the quality seemed okay but i wont be buying this again - i purchased a Shakespeare Medium Action Travel Mate Spinning Rod (6-Feet 6-Inch)at the same time from Amazon and that is so much better than this product - will order another one of that for my upcoming trip to tahiti.If you do end up buying this kit, PLEASE assemble the rod right away after you receive and examine it for any cracks or open joints...."
4,Good fishing kit without instructions,"I think it's a good fishing kit for beginners. But I couldn't find any instructions on how to set up the fishing rod and reel. I even tried to look at okuma's website, and there is no instruction available."
1,very dissatisfied,"I'm 42 years old and had a couple fishing poles as a kid and were both birthday or Christmas presents and this is the only pole I've ever bought for myself and the 1st pole I've had since I was a kid. My girlfriend and I have been wanting to have a fishing pole to go spend the day at the creek when the salmon run in the fall so we anxiously awaited our (my) new pole. When it got here and I opened it up and examining the contents and started assembling what looked to be a nice pole and reel, I quickly realized it was all too good to be true...it is missing the shortest, thinnest end piece or ""tip"". I looked all through the case and foam that holds all the pieces in place. I took all the foam out, looked all through the box it came in...nothing.How angry am I right now?? Maybe I'll see if anyone decides to send me the missing piece and my anger and disappointment will subside. Ill keep you all posted."
5,Fascinating story,"This book tells the incredible story of a train filled with gold, fleeing Hungary as the Russians conquer it from the Nazis.Full of riveting details and historical analysis, the research done for this book gives a wide background on the history of Jews in Hungary before and during World War II and provides with a detailed account of how Jewish property was confiscated by the Hungarian authorities, transported in a train to Austria, confiscated by US and French armies to finally disappear."
4,"A must for those who take pride in their ""deck building""","This book also contains some of the top 1996 U.S. National tourney decks as well as other popular type II decks. Text given by Mr. Baxter makes for some fun reading, too. Enjoy!!"
4,Anointed lyrics. Good music for relaxation,"The CD has music for everyone, hip-hop, traditional, jazzy-feel, rap... it's a great buy. Sara has a wonderful voice with an expansive range. I hope to hear more from her in ther future."
1,Waste of time and money,"The authors of this DVD use cynical manipulation of words to convince the viewer that the Biblical age of Earth is right. They doubt the carbon dating method, which is acceptable in itself, but they give you nothing instead. Their reasoning goes as following: if the carbon dating is not precise, then the Bible must be right. They provide no plausible scientific alternative whatsoever and ignore obvious geological data and common sense in order to justify the Biblical age of Earth. I found this DVD a complete waste of time and money. I was hoping to learn more about fossils, but learned really nothing, apart from ""Earth must be young, because the Bible says so"". Don't be confused by the title and the image on the cover, it's NOT about fossils."
1,The Christian view,"The purpose of this production is to cast doubt on scientific method and to promote the nutty, Bible-centered ""young earth"" view -- which runs counter to all available evidence."
2,Who are these commentators?,"The video quality was mediocre, which is to be expected since most of the footage is from the early 70s, mostly from one performance. The sound is pretty good. The most dissapointing part was that there are no interviews with any of the members of Argent. Most of the video time is dedicated to commentary by various individuals whose titles simply say ""Record Producer"" or ""Classic Rock"" and most of their commentary is generic... very little inside stories or scoops, just basic commentary that an music-lover watching the video could get.Who are these commentators? I just want to see Argent."
3,WHY DON'T THEY TALK ABOUT THE NEXUS ALBUM ?,"I'M A GREAT FAN OF ARGENT FOR SURE BUT THEY CRITICAL GUYS IN THAT DVD DON'T MAKE THE REVIEW OF THE NEXUS ALBUM.THE CRITICAL IS ON THE ALBUMS WITH THE FIRST LINE UP BAND MEMBERS AND NEXUS WAS MADE BY THESE MEMBERS.ALSO , I UNDERSTAND ENGLISH BUT I'M NOT BILINGUAL AND THERE'S NO FRENCH SUBTITLES, FOR ME A FRENCH-CANADIAN GUY, SUBTITLES ARE IMPORTANT, EVEN MORE WHEN CRITICS ARE MADE BY BRITISH ACCENT PERSONS.OF THAT ""CRITICAL REVIEW"" SERIE FROM CLASSIC ROCK PRODUCTIONS, DEEP PURPLE, RAINBOW AND DAVID BOWIE DVD'S HAVE THE SUBTITLES IN 2 OR 3 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.ALSO THERE'S 3 COMPLETE LIVE SONGS OF A SAME TV CONCERT IN THE BONUS SECTION, IT'S OK BUT IN THE DOCUMENTARY, THERE'S MORE FOOTAGE OF THAT SHOW(OTHER SONG EXCERPTS):WHY DO THESE SONGS ARE NOT IN THE BONUS SECTION AS COMPLETE SONGS ?ALL THESE THINGS IN THAT DVD ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE, SO EVEN I LOVE THAT BAND, I ASKED FOR A REFUND !"
3,POURQUOI NEXUS N'EST PAS CRITIQUÉ ?,"JE SUIS UN VRAI FAN DE ARGENT MAIS DANS CE DVD, L'ALBUM NEXUS N'EST PAS CRITIQUÉ, C'EST INCONCEVABLE , C'EST LE MEILLEUR ALBUM DE ARGENT.CEUX QUI FONT LA CRITIQUE DES ALBUMS DU GROUPE DANS CE DVD DISENT QUE IN DEEP ET/OU ENCORE SONT LES MEILLEURS ALBUMS.CET HISTORIQUE DU GROUPE N'EST PAS COMPLET SANS NEXUS.EN PLUS, IL N'Y A PAS DE SOUS TITRES, QUAND CE SONT DES ANGLAIS (BRITISH)QUI PARLENT, PARFOIS C'EST MIEUX D'AVOIR LES SOUS TITRES POUR VRAIMENT BIEN COMPRENDRE CE QUI EST DIT.J'AI AUSSI VU DE LA SÉRIE ""CRITICAL REVIEW"" DEEP PURPLE, RAINBOW ET DAVID BOWIE ET IL Y AVAIT DES SOUS TITRES !ET POUR CONCLURE, IL Y A 3 EXTRAITS (CHANSONS COMPLETES), DANS LA SECTION BONUS MAIS DANS LE DOCUMENTAIRE, IL Y A DES EXTRAITS DE D'AUTRES CHANSONS DU MEME SPECTACLE:POURQUOI ON NE LES RETROUVE PAS EN VERSION COMPLETE DANS LA SECTION BONUS ?COMME J'AI DIT PRÉCÉDEMMENT, J'AIME BIEN LE GROUPE MAIS JE ME SUIS FAIT REMBOURSER !"
5,Uzi Tritium Wristwatch,"I have purchased three of these watches and had one replaced. The quartz movement on these watches is phenomenally accurate and this is about 1/3 the price of other tritium watches (about$80.00). I set my watch by national bureau of standards station WWV. In a year the second hand gained 12 seconds, the minute hand was right on. Quality control? I lost the first watch, the second was replaced free because the tritium didn't fluoresce, the third watch had the second hand fall off after a year. I have paid for one watch that didn't last past a year. The buyer will have to decide whether another brand tritium watch at over $250.00 is preferable."
1,cheap..cheap plastic gsrbage,"this was a complete waste of money''so small u cant see the hands::returned back to amazon ,,dont waste your time."
5,Great Book - Highly Recommend,"This is one of those books that I pretty much ""devoured"" - few books do that for me today. It's very readable for one thing. For another, almost every chapter (they are very short) resonated for me - I found myself shaking my head in agreement about almost all of the advice articles. This is also a book I intend to not only keep, but keep close to my bedstand - I'll think it will be a book I reach for often to re-read certain chapters when I feel challenged by lifes little surprises. If you liked Dale Carnegie, but thought it was a little dated for modern times, then you'll really appreciate this book."
1,Why would they say this works?,"This book has little helpful information... a complete waste of my money. The advice is very basic and somewhat naive, like if you tell your friend you are feeling sad and your friend says ""Well, just stop feeling sad and you'll feel better"". Maybe this book would read well to someone who just needed a quick boost rather than lifestyle and perspective changes, but honestly that type of person would probably benefit more from a visit with a friend or a hot bath than from this book."
2,A little disappointing,"It is all rather reduced to simplistic sound bites. I was hoping for a lot ,and feel the book did not deliver."
2,"Overpriced; only for tiny, easy-to-remove bones","Had high expectations for this, but it simply doesn't work well enough for pulling the kind of long, thin, deeply embedded bones you're likely to find in a large salmon steak or fillet, for example. The jaws aren't toothed, so if the bone gives more than a little resistance to the pull, it'll slip right through. Perhaps if you're working with a smaller, more tender fillet, the broad jaws of these tweezers may make it easy to scrape gently along the flesh and extract minor bones, but otherwise I suggest putting your money toward a good pair of stainless-steel (dishwasher-safe) bone pliers with toothed jaws, such as those available from Wusthof (I recommend their 5880 model), Messermeister, or Gilbert."
3,Nice looks but.....,"I had this product for a while... I have paid quite some money for the Global branded item...I butcher fish among other things on daily basis, as a chef... Performance wise it really works good with bigger fish and bones but it lucks charisma in certain tasks and its more ""bulky"" than other designs.... The design is good visually and the quality of the product is there ,but i wouldn't part with my trusted fish bone pliers and the set of cheapo japanese tweezers (slanted and straight tip) as they perform good on most occasions....Maybe a redesign in the future will do justice to the price......"
3,EARNEST AS USUAL BUT NOTHING NEW,"RESTORATION is another collection of evangelistical songs, sharply produced and earnestly performed. Most of this talented trio's songs are globally oriented, with an occasional more personal message. Their strongest songs are those that talk to the listener on a personal level. WHEN GOD RAN is such a song; rather than being preachy, it emerges as one person's singular experience in his relationship with God. A PLACE CALLED GRACE is also a stirring and eloquent track. One certainly can't deny the trio's sincerity or commitment to their faith. I wish they'd take more risks in their composing and bring more musical variety to their albums."
1,Missing product,The container was missing one of three staple cartridges.I guess that's a new way to make a buck - Give a small discount and short the order by a third.I am too busy to bother to dispute or return the product. But I am not to busy to stop ordering from Amazon.com for supplies for my business.
5,CAN IT GET GET BETTER THAN THIS?,"THIS BOOK IS GREAT, A GREAT BOIGRAPHY OF TODAYS SPUNKIEST HUNK SETH GREEN, GIVES YOU SOME OF THE MOST COOLEST GOSSIP AND FACTS ABOUT HIM, I AM PERSONALLY HIS NO.1 FAN AND KNOW LOADS ABOUT HIM AND I DID ENJOY READING THIS BOOK AND YOU WILL TOO."
1,Not whats advertised,Stay away you will not get a 6pack. Going to finish this and report the fruad. Not what i Was expecting
1,Horrible,"I did not purchase this product from Amazon, sad to say because at least then I could get my money back, but from a local hardware store. This didn't come close to covering up the old blue paint I was attempting to paint over. I have used Kilz before with amazing results. This ""new and improved"" stuff is the worst. Save yourself a lot of work and do not purchase. It absolutely does not do what it claims."
1,This stuff is awful to apply!,"As you apply the paint and come back is peels off the wall. Maybe adding water might help, but I did not try it.(You should not have to do that). I am going back to Kelly Moore paint."
5,"gorgeous packaging, philistines","the packaging of the cds is great. i love the sleeves. the idea is they feel like record sleeves. the 4-box pictures are bonus. the ribbons work if you use them carefully, but i agree, they should have been sewn in. there is absolutely no excuse for the bargain-basement book binding -- smythe-sewn at the least, but I would have expected hardcover. Oh well. Of course the music is great. If you don't like the sleeves, get a small 24-sleeve CD carrying case (like from Case Logic and the like)."
3,AP410 Kit,"Price is pretty good & easy to install, Ricoh has a guide on their website how each part is installed only problem is when we did this the machine still was reading ""replace maintenance kit"" after we powered back on with new kit installed.Still trying to figure out how to reset so that is why I'm giving it 3/5 stars. Kit seems easy enough to consider a ""Customer replaceable item"" but without resetting counter doesn't help very much."
1,Wrong Product Sent - How ever it Worked.,"About seller ""Westronics, Inc."":-I purchased RC23 and was sent RC65. I will never purchase from this seller.About product ""DirecTV RC65"":-RC65 (which I received instead of RC23) is great. However obviously it will not support everything that RC23 would. If you need RC65; instead of purchasing it from DirecTv, purchase it from some other vendor from Amazon.com and save."
3,It Passed The Time...,"This is a perfectly average compilation of reworked fairy tales. Some of them are better than others, as you'll find in almost any short story collection. I bought this used, so I feel like I got my money's worth - a somewhat entertaining read that killed an afternoon. Good, but certainly not great."
2,"Straw Into Something That Shines, Almost","The only real appeal here is to watch the great Harry Langdon take a pile of straw and spin it into something kind of amber and shiney, even if it isn't gold. His performance is remarkable given the lack of anything substantial for him to do or react to. That he gets any laughs from viewers at all is a real testament to his talent.As with other DVDs released by this company (Alpha), the print is poor on all levels. I got this since it was cheap and I was working on a research project involving Langdon and figured it was the easiest way to see the film. Unless you have a similar reason (films with mannequins?) there's not much here for you.Langdon's funny, but the film does all it can to hide that."
3,Harry Shines Through,"Actually this is a decent little movie quite funny and sweet. The presence of Harry is an extra bonus and what a bonus. I have to agree with the other viewer Harry makes this movie, but it's not his Little Elf character, it's Harry Langdon acting the role of a loyal loving husband whose wives friends suspect is having an affair. Harry's great talent shines through and you watch it just because he is in it."
2,Split Vote,"I wish Amazon would adopt a rating system similar to Home Theater magazine or Sound & Vision. This light comedy starring Harry Langdon would be enjoyable if the source material was good. But, as usual Steve Kaplan, owner of Alpha Video has released something that looks like it was transferred from a used VHS videocassette.So, I give this two star rating although I would give the film a 2.5 rating if it was a decent copy of the original film. This is only worth watching if you are a Harry Langdon fan or you can purchase for a dollar or two.I don't see much point in reviewing the movie when the Alpha version is so atrocious."
5,The true and inspiring story of Pastor Sunday Adelaja,"Till My Last Breath is the true and inspiring story of Pastor Sunday Adelaja who left his come country of Nigeria to study journalism in Belarus, USSR. There, government officials tried to persuade him to study socialism instead, but Sunday resisted, preferring to turn to God and not the State for his ideals. Threats and false accusations followed his refusal of the authorities demands, but Sunday started reaching out to those in need. Today he is pastor to more than 20,000 believers in the Ukraine and has founded churches all over the world. Till My Last Breath showcases the impact of one man's faith and what God can do when that man obeys His call. Pastor Sunday Shares the secrets of his heart and the keys to his successfully ministry in this full color, 28 minute, DID documentary that is strongly recommended viewing for all members of the Christian community regardless of denominational affiliation."
4,Looks good on the wall,I hung this sword on my wall and it stays there: It doesn't seem to be well balanced for actual use. It is quite a looker though; especially since it has that Don Quixote image on the handguard.
4,Very Nice,"Very nice moisturizer with a nice scent. I'm allergic to most scents, but this one didn't bother me at all. Only wish it came in a larger bottle, as the 8 oz. bottle doesn't last long."
5,Wonderful Lotion!,"I purchased this lotion because my daughters loved the scent and the way it moisturizes. I bought a sample home from a hotel months ago and when the sample was gone, I had to go on line and buy a full size of this wonderful lotion!"
2,Smell gets old,Felt a little bit waxy and the smell was not great after a few weeks.. it changed or something. There are better lotions available.
2,Average Quality Only,"The bath gel arrived already opened and leaking, poor packaging; Amazon did give me a full refund. The body moisturizer is not very moisturizing and leaves my skin kind of sticky. The fragrance is OK but not great. I had a travel size moisturizer in this same scent from some hotel chain I stayed in (Staybridge? Marriott? not sure), which I loved! But this brand doesn't measure up to the hotel's version."
3,Track Listing,"Another great live CD. If you have got the previous live CD's you will know exactly what to expect just with better production values.My gripe is with the track listing. I live in Australia and could have bought the CD locally however the listing on Amazon had the additional tracks; Haircut, Gear Jammer, Move It On Over and You talk to much.Much to my dissapointment these tracks are NOT on the CD I received.Still a great CD but if the above tracks are your reason for buying it I would check first."

3,Reader Let Down,"I love David Morrell and have read just about all his books. I couldn't put this one down. He develops the characters, the setting, and the history for a wonderful story. I devoured each page, anxious to get to the next one... When I reached the ending I was greatly disappointed. There were so many questions left unanswered. It was like David Morrell wrote 99% of the book, then put it aside and some stranger picked it up and scribbled a quick end so he could get it to the publisher. I felt cheated out of a proper ending to this otherwise great read. David Morrell should have spent time writing a worthy ending instead of writing the new introduction at the beginning. I was disappointed."
4,The most exciting book I have read in a long time!,"This classic novel from David Morrell is defenitily one of the best and most scary books I have read in a long time.This edition is the ""complete and unaltered"" edition from finepress Donald Grant. According to the authors foreword a whole lot has been changed in this edition compared to the regular edition that was first published, but since i have not read the true 1st edition I can not tell how big the difference is. but anyway this book kicks b...!The book is beautifully printed and typeset and with some ok illustrations by T. Canty. The trade hardcover only features these in black and white, but the deluxe edition has them in color, but also cost a whopping [$]. Unfortunately it doesnt seem that Amazon features the trade hardcover priced at [$], but try contacting them to see if they can get it for you, or get it directly from the publisher...Hihgly recommended!!!"
3,A pretty good read!,"After reading Assumed Identity and Desperate Measures (which are fantastic novels) I expected more out of the Totem. It is good, but not Morrell's best. I expected more out of the conclusion which seemed dissapointing. If your looking for a thrilling read, try Assumed Identity or Desperate Measures."
2,Not what it appeared,"I picked up a used copy of The Totem recently thinking that it would be a standard horror novel. But after a promising start, this book became more of a medical thriller than horror novel. The character development was not particularly great and I found myself reading this to get through it rather than enjoying it. I know this is an early effort by Morrell and he has since moved into more the political intrigue genre but this book in my opinion is not worth the read."
5,Revenge of the Hippies,"This here's a classic horror novel that has been revised since it first saw print. It's a selection in the handy Horror: The 100 Best Books by Stephen Jones. I don't recall which version was talked about in the 100 Best, but I believe its the unrevised one. Nonetheless, it's held up very well over time. It's something of a cultural parable (hippie vs. establishment) that excedes expectation, horror convention and cliche. Recommended."
3,Horrible happenings...,"but not a true horror story, more like a medical thriller. Nice gory touches. Don't quite get the hippie commune tie-in though, that part was an unnecessary distraction. Otherwise a good, involving story. Great main characters."
4,MAN OR ANIMAL?,"Another great adventure novel from David Morrell -- this one however has its feet firmly planted in the horror genre. This is Morrell's take on the werewolf myth. Something is disemboweling the cattle in the Wyoming town of Potter's Field and it is up to a group of deeply flawed protagonists to solve the problem.Be aware, there are two versions of this book -- the longer and the shorter. The eBook contains BOTH, even though it may not appear to. I have only read the longer version so far. Sometimes, the shorter book appears as part of the last chapter."
3,Not a favorite CD,Stan Whitmire uses a style on this recording different from other CDs I have of his and I find it boring to listen to.
3,A so-so CD from Juice following her major label career,"Although I am a big fan of Juice Newton music, I must say that this CD falls short in production vallue compared with her ""big time"" major label releases from the Capitol and RCA Record labels.The low production budget for this CD is visible (or audible, as the case may be) here in comparison with her works from those earlier years. Juice's voice is not quite the same as before either.Not horrible, but nothing to write home about."
5,A Must Have!!,"This is the best spatula you could have in your kitchen. It is fantastic for fish because it is very thin and slides under easily to flipping. BUT, you will also find it handy for almost anything light."
5,Its not a water pipe its a bong,This album is one of the best ones ive heard in a long time all the track are great
4,Famous artist is a murder victim,"In this book, part of the Bed-and-Breakfast Mystery series, Judith and her cousin Renie take a break to go to their old family cottage. While there they visit their neighbor Riley, who is a renowned artist. Shortly after their visit, he is killed and is found lying in tempera paint. There are a lot of neighbors who are possible suspects along with girlfriends, a crooked agent, and clients who have purchased Riley's paintings. One of the most delightful characters is Abbot N. Costello, a neighborhood police investigator who couldn't solve a crime if the perpretrator gave himself up. As usual, Judith comes up with the answer to the crime and she comes close to being killed herself before the murderer is brought to justice. Is it just me or does Judith spend more time with her cousin than with her new husband? It's hard to believe that she's as crazy about him as she claims and yet spends so much time away from him."
4,and the fun continues,"This 6th book in the series is an easy and delightful read. The Bed and Breakfast series is what I consider a good, fun read and while some of them are better than others as murder mysteries go, I find them all enjoyable."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this book specifically because of the front cover picture. I wanted to make this quilt, or at least make the row of houses. However the quilt pictured on front cover is merely an example of one made using Ms. Hollaby's techniques. Nowhere in book are any instructions to make this quilt. I am angry, disappointed and believe the front cover it is false advertising."
5,SUPERB & SUBLIME!,"What great piano music. We have all six of Ann Horstick's albums and if you just need some R&R or peaceful music in your working background, this is definitely it! Very calm and soothing to ease the stresses away. The best of the best! Wish she was known outside of her private concerts and had more albums available. Perfect for Income Tax time. We thoroughly enjoy her ""SofTone"" brand of piano playing. Really mellows anyone, perfect for background music at social gatherings as well. THE BEST!"
5,Great artist,"I discovered Martha Davis because she is in a film called ""Rhythm and blues Revue 1954"". For me this CD has been the unique chance to know her career.It's whorth to pay attention to her voice and fine piano playing."
4,Great Set,"I purchased these elsewhere for a lot more money. They work great. They are more lightweight than I would have anticipated, but don't let that fool you."
5,Qaulitiy from France for your table,The bumble bee is a known sign for qaulity in France. These type of knives are the same ones used in the top restaurants in France and the rest of the world over. There is not a finer steak knife in the world. I have been to the factory and have seen these craftsmen at work. They create perfection.
4,Stylish steak knives,"A grand surprise, these are much better looking and definitely better behaved than any I have bought over the years while paying much more. They are nicely balanced, cut well, and even look good as part of a place setting. The more slender shape, curved handle, and even the position of the Napoleonic bee come together in a nice design that is functional and a pleasure to use. (The little bee-shaped finger rest is a conversation starter too.) I've heard of another set by the same company with bone handles and a much higher price tag. These suit us just fine."
4,Swiss Army Watch,"This watch is a bit heavier than I thought it would be, but that's not really an issue... just an observation. It looks great, is reliable and durable, and the price was right. I'm happy I bought it."
5,amazing. you'll be mentaly drooling throughout the play,"This play is fantastic. Rivera does an outstanding job of bringing the need for great acting, directing, designing, and technical work all together. If you like ""Marisol"", read ""The Promise""; another play be him. This is a knock-your-socks-off script."
3,"In depth, but confusing...","Warning: if you are a beginner DO NOT START HERE. This book and system do not lend themselves easily to those who are just starting out. On the other hand, if you are experienced and love Celtic culture, this is a wonderful system. The book is comprehensive and the cards and art are lovely. Plus, those who are drawn to the Celts will make a distinct connection. I've found if you have patience you will get wonderful results."
4,A very stylish pump,"These are a beautiful pair of pumps. I love the tailored look I can wear with them: trousers and a vest. You get not just the ribbon ties as seen in the picture but also regular cord ties, though I think the ribbon is much more attractive. The only complaint I have about these pumps is that there isn't a lot of padding inside, so as the day went on my foot would rub back and forth in the front and cause some friction. Other than that they are wonderful."
2,Not a good value,"This laptop came in a box that said basically no returns once it is opened. I nearly sent it back. I should have. It came with so little RAM that it was frustrating to use the entire time I owned it, until I put in 2G of RAM. Like the other users who critiqued it... the lid cracked very early on. The latches stopped working and jammed. The wireless won't work now and says it is fine. The DVD player now skips. I think this laptop was made to be of use for the 1 year warranty and that's all. I bought an extended warranty and they were much more helpful than the people at HP. It was a nice idea to offer a special LiveStrong computer but they picked the wrong one. I paid too much for this computer."
2,"An unbearably bleak, anti-female story.",How can these filmmaker/storytellers live with themselves? They've created an appallingly insulting end-of-the-millenium story using rape as a spectator sport. Unforgivable.
2,What ?,"While I'm a long time fan of Dylan Thomas's prose and poetry, I've never understood the fascination with this sloppy, non-sensical play.It is, to me, a moment when Thomas stopped being Thomas and made a clumsy attempt to emulate James Joyce. The result is a confusing and pointless play.That said, the man was a marvel. Read his poetry, read ""Adventures In The Skin Trade"" and ""Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Dog."""
1,Not for me,"Often hailed as genius, Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood proved far from that lofty title for me. First I read the play. Next I saw a University of Richmond production and finally, I read the play again. I thought I was missing out, somehow, and decided to discuss the play with one of my former theatre professors. At last, I've concluded that although some may find beauty in the so called poetry of Thomas' language, I find nothing but confusion - both for the reader and the audience member. I am a theatre professional and I would not choose to mount a production of Under Milk Wood at any cost. I fear I'd lose the audience."
3,Some memorable figures and a wonderful cast of characters,"I recently read this while on vacation. The entire cast of characters is wonderful, wonderfully quirky, yet somehow very ""normal"". It is hard to describe genre-wise as it reads differently than how it was apparently intended - as a play for radio. But it works. A town of 500, with three quaint streets, a postman who reads the mail to all the (illiterate) inhabitants, my favorite couple in literature (Mr. and Mrs. Cherry Owen - she has two husbands, one drunk and one sober)and one of the most touching characters, Bessie Bighead, who was kissed once while not looking and never again despite looking... Fun!"
4,It's a radio play!,"This is probably the greatest play ever written for RADIO! It's a medium rarely thought of for such things today, and theater people repeatedly come a cropper in trying to put it on the stage. I've seen several stage productions and one TV version, and the piece simply does not work that way. Dylan Thomas takes the LISTENER inside the characters' dreams and thoughts. Once they are concretized or thingified on a stage or screen, they are destroyed. Don't read it. Close your eyes and LISTEN. It's magnificent - funny, sweet, moving."
4,Nice watch,"This is a very nice watch. I read all of the reviews and thought some were a bit critical. You get a nice watch for very little money. Nice styling, keeps perfect time and the chronograph works perfectly. It comes with instructions to zero out each hand so, if you read a review stating that the hands are not at zero, the person probably didn't zero them out correctly.Bottom line: it looks as good in person as it does in the photos...nice watch. If you want incredible then you might spend more money on something more expensive, but this watch has the look of money!"
4,Great for Globals,"Definitely does great on sharpening the Globals. Barely any effort, seems fool-proof. Doesn't restore the blade completely, but much faster and easier than a stone and a ceramic honer (which I've dropped and broken 3 in the past 8 years or so). I tried it with other knives and gave up after a while, seems to take a lot more strokes with minimal improvement."
5,Pretty slick!,"I use the Messermeister Chantry for my German-made knives and wanted something similar for my Asian edges. This tool really works great. I've used it on my Shuns and my Mac Santoku and plan to hone my Global chef's knife with it. It's great to have something simple that keep those edges really, really sharp."
5,My Global knife has a new life!,I'm so happy now that I can use my Global knife again. It sat in my drawer for over a year because I couldn't get it sharp enough with the ceramic sharpening sticks. Now a few passes on the Global sharpener and it's as good as new! Highly recommend this sharpener for your Global knives.
1,damaged my knife,"This sharpener damaged my Global knife. The knife doesn't only rest in one position within the slot. If you let it drop all the way in, it leaves scratch marks along one side of the knife, all the way up to half an inch high. I did not like the actual sharpening either. It jumped on the ceramic wheel. I did not like this model of sharpener at all. I finally switched to the new Wustof model for my Global knife, the one that has the carbide on one side and ceramic on the other. It worked great on my Global knife."
1,This doesn't work,"I've had this thing for a couple years now. I pull it out every once in a while, hoping. Maybe someone can come show me what I'm doing wrong."
2,Not a significant difference in sharpness,My knives had become dull before I used the sharpener. Even after repeated uses they just weren't that sharp. I expected it to bring the knives much closer to factory sharpness and was unfortunately very disappointed.
3,"It works, but does not restore the original Global sharpness","I think this a good product, it does take the science out of keeping a servicable blade... but I don't think it does a great job in combination with Global knives. I would not state it outright dulls them, but it does not restore the original utter sharp edge. Personally, I think the Wusthoff santoku sharpener does a better job of restoring the Global knife edge - but the Wusthoff has the drawback it wears out after some months of heavy use. This one stays around longer, but the cost is a slightly duller, ""un-Global"" sharpness.I think it is best suited for other knives, not the high end, expensive Global knives. I guess they struck a marketing agreement or something for now, but while I own this product, and use it for other knives, I will not use it for my Global knives. It's either the stone or the Wusthoff."
1,Pretty mediocre,"The original hone on my Global knife was unreal, it could easily shave the hair off my arm. Once it started to dull, I went down many avenues to get that original sharpness. This is NOT it. This thing will tear the edge off and get nowhere close.I ended up getting a 2 stone set that has a jig that allows various angles to be accurately held. Much better. Don't do it."
1,Ceramic wheels wear unevenly creating poor edge,"After having this sharpener for a little less than a year I've found that the ceramic wheels develop ridges after time, which prevents the blade from getting good contact, which means very poor sharpening. To make matters worse, the plastic axle on the ""Fine"" wheel snapped, making the sharpener totaly useless. This after ""babying"" the unit since it's purchase, as I wasn't really impressed with the construction to start with. Other sharpeners (those with diamond-coated wheels) may prove more useful."
5,easy,"The sharpener was surprisingly easy to use, and after a few sharpenings still looks sturdy. It's somewhat idiotproof (necessary when it's me in the kitchen...)."
3,A very expensive gewgaw,"Before you buy the Shinkansen Sharpener for your Global knives you must understand that it doesn't return the blades to their factory sharpness.When I first bought my Globals I was warry of using my old ceramic stone on their extremely acute edge, so I bought the Shinkansen Sharpener to go with them. When they arrived, the knives' sharpness lived up to everything that's said about them, but after I ran the chef's knife through both slots several times... the knife got DULLER! Repeated use did not do any more harm to the blade, but it never improved either.It seems that, because of it's simplicity, the Shinkansen Sharpener is best for returning very dull blades back to a servicable edge, but it will never get them really sharp."
3,"takes some getting used to, may mar your knives","I picked this up as a quick and easy knife sharpener for work. It managed to scratch up the side of the blade of one of my Global knives with the plastic guide.the slots/guide to run your knife blade through are narrow, some larger knives may not fit into it if the blade is thick.after about 1 year one of the stones broke, however you can buy replacements.For the home user, this will suffice. If you use your knife all day long like I do, I recommend the good old tri stone instead. Ok to have as an emergency knife sharpener in your knife bag.I was never was able to get a good enough edge with this product to do fine chiffonade and other cuts that require good knife skills."
1,eh...try something else,"I gave this a super bad rating a few months ago - something to the effect of ""avoid avoid avoid...at all cost"" - which upon review seemed a tad over-the-top.The things is, as others have reported, this device will take a sharp knife and make it dull. I've never been able to get it to do anything other than leave unsightly scrapes down the length of the blade.You're better off saving your money for a good steel, which is the only way I've ever been able to keep a Global knife sharp."
4,must have for global owners,"This is simply the tool to use on Global knives and on the Furi asian knife. It puts a great edge on both and does so quickly. It may look cheaply made, but when Mayflower lost mine in a move recently, it was one of the first things that I had to replace right away. It works very well and I wouldn't be without it. Unfortunately, it isn't for every knife...just the Globals and Furis."
2,Not any where near the 1st and 2nd,I get so excited when the new Buddha Bar CD's come out and rush to get them as fast as possible. This time and the last few hasn't been as deep and strong as the ones in the past. Still a nice collection of unique music but a bit of dissapointment for me.
1,the worse,it has nothing to do with the Buddha Bar music concept...it is just another chill out compilation.
2,Really Boring Buddha Bar,"Wow. Really disappointed in this one. It ALL sounds alike, boring beats, and both CDs focus on a house/dance beat. We count on Buddha Bar NOT to produce the same old house tunes found in all those other compilations. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I didn't really find any tracks that stood out. If you like thumpy background music at your parties, this is a great one for you. Nobody will mind talking over these tracks."
3,Some good tracks but not enough,The buddha bar series has declined ever since vol. 8 It was nice while it lasted!
5,Great Entertainment for Mystery Fans!,"This product is the same as the 7th season, Volume 2. These Perry Mason episodes are timeless, and I am looking forward to the remaining seasons!"
5,Perry just keeps getting better!,"Perry Mason has to be my all-time favorite show. No matter how many times I have seen an episode, there is always more to find. These DVD's are special because so much previously trimmed material has been restored. Often, in syndication, the entire first scene was cut, which took away from the buildup of the plot. I also LOVE the scenes with Perry driving up to the scene, the interior shots and the retro-tech! Where else can we find dictaphones, tape recorders the size of a suitcase, and yes, the first car phones? This seventh season has a number of episodes not released in the first round of syndication, so you may find an episode you have never seen! What a treat! And even better- season 7 Vol 2 is already on pre-order!!!"
3,I didn't know that!,Edited versions? I thought these were the ORIGINAL versions. Perry is still my favorite show but this is sad news indeed. I always wondered what ever happened to Gertie? Now I know- She's on the floor. And why the year-long wait between releases? You can do better.
2,"Bad sound, avoidable errors","Hello, I have only watched three episodes of this instalment so far, but I have noticed poor sound quality (brittle, harsh). Also, the credits on Episode 1 are from another episode and the order of the episodes on this first disk are out of sequence (Episode 2 on the disk was actually Episode 4 when it originally ran). Given that we pay a premium price for just half a season, I find second-rate quality unacceptable. Boo to CBS."
2,Picture quality is not as good on this series.,"I see that a number of reviewers have noted problems with the sound quality on this DVD set. I have noticed problems with the picture quality as well. In the episode titled ""The Case of the Festive Felon"", in the court room scene where Perry Mason goes after the killer on the stand there are scratches on the print. You can see them on her white sweater. Really surprised to see that as the quality of the DVDs have been excellent until now. On a side note, I haven't seen the same problems with the eighth series, so far."
5,Perry's #1 Fan,"My all time favorite series.... purchasing them as they come out. Great quality video, my favorite collection of DVD's by far!"
4,What can you say?,You know the format; you know Perry Mason will figure it all out and Ham(ilton) Burger will look like a dofus when he does; you'll wonder what exactly is going on between Perry & Della and Paul & Della. But it's fun to watch and some of the stories are very interesting. The only bad thing is the price - $35 + is a little much i think...
5,Perry Mason 7th season vol. 1,Wonderful restoration of these old shows. It brought back great memories when I saw them as a kid. I can't wait to get all of the Perry Mason episodes in my possession.
5,Money with morality,This is an extremely thorough and eminently practical guide to handling your finances. Anyone who struggles with budgeting or wants to manage their money with moral responsibility will benefit from this excellent book.
3,Disappointing,"If you've read any book on personal finances, you already have the financial information contained in this book. If you've read a Christian book on finances, you have the Biblical information contained in this book. If you use the index in your Catechism, you'll have the information on Church tradition contained in this book.In all, this is a very light introduction to the subject. If you'd like more in-depth information, I would recommend one of Larry Burkett's books; if you'd like a very user-friendly, practical guide complete with forms, I'd recommend Ethan Pope's Creating Your Personal Money MAP.This book has only 58 pages of text; the rest of the printed pages are multiple copies of four different forms--unnecessary for anyone with access to a copier."
3,"Will do it all, but very heavy and unwieldy","There's no question that this ladder will do as much as the ""big name"" ladders that go up to 21 feet. However, when extended to 21 feet, I can't lift it into place by myself (and I'm a big strong guy). If you don't absolutely need the extra height, I'd recommend you go with the 17 foot Cosco ladder. This one is very heavy and not something you want to carry around, at least by one person, very often. But it is a very sturdy ladder and handles me, at 245 lbs and I'm sure if you're 300lbs it will hold you. But it's just too heavy and bulky. If you use it as a stepladder or some of the shorter sizes, it works very well, just be aware of the weight before you order and buy the shorter one if it will do. Otherwise, don't expect to use it at 21 feet without a second person to help."
5,Sudden Strike Forever,"I play this game every day. It is awesome! Tanks,army guys,trucks,air suport and a lot more.You can be Allys,Germans,or Russians. This game is like Blitzkrieg. And it is a real RTS game. And their is always something blowing up. Thank you for reading my review."
3,nice game,THIS IS A SWEET GAME you get so much more than the original ss like the map editor and new landscapes and units this is the number one game!!
2,Returning It,"I tend to use Lancome and Dior mascaras, but thought I'd try a cheaper mascara now that my husband's been laid off. I decided to try this one since it's received a lot of hype. Perhaps others may like this, but I was very disappointed. Couldn't even tell it was on. It didn't lengthen nor volumize. So I'll be returning it. Really bummed, cuz I keep hoping to find a less expensive mascara that I like as much as the Lancome, Clinique and Dior mascaras. Tried EyesByDesign and it gave great lengthening and volumizing but not a fan of the comb plus it flakes and it hurts BAD if I cry! If you are someone like me who has fallen in love with the mascaras by Lancome, Clinique, Dior, and you've found a less expensive mascara you love that lengthens, volumizes and doesn't flake....please post what mascara you love here. I'd love others' inputs!"
2,It's ok,"It looks ok when you initially put it on, then within an hr or so the lashes start to look dull (not much length or volume)."
3,Gets old quickly,"I have used several of these, on recommendation that it is very good for the price. But I realized that after a certain amount of time, like 3-4 weeks, it starts flaking badly and irritates my eyes."
3,Not exactly as pictured,"I usually love this mascara and have for years. I signed up for the subscribe and save on this Maybelline Full 'N Soft, Very Black masacara last month. I received mine in the time it said, but it wasn't exactly as pictured. Mine had a curved wand, which is not what is shown. I wouldn't have bought it had I known that... The mascara worked okay, but I didn't get the results I normally get from the straight wand."
1,WORST MASCARA,This mascara did nothing just totally nothing other reviews said it would add lenght that it did do but didn't make them full looking very very disappointed i wanted something soft not hard that it is but don't make your lashs full what so ever it goes on so light you can't even tell you have mascara on
4,Very Entertaining,"I have known about these ""rules"" for many years and have wished for a wider reading of them in our society. This is a welcome volumn that many will find pedantic, yet some will read with the uncritical eye and will benefit from it greatly. Even though Mr. Washington did not originate these rules, he obviously did think highly of them and I think we could benefit from them as well. The ""translation"" is spotty in places and down-right wrong in others, but is helpful throughout."
1,This book is NOT by George Washington,"The line ""by George Washington"" on the title-page of this book is highly misleading. A note in very small type (on the copyright page) makes clear that the text of the book was merely copied out by Washington from a set of rules first written in France on or before 1595 and translated into English in 1640. Washington was not the author of even a single word in the book."
4,O.K.,For the price I was expecting alittle better coming from Stanley. The finsh is matt not polished and they are made in China. Still not a bad set for the price and the handles realy stand out for identifing at a quick look unlike other brands.
5,Roshco Non Stick Bakeware,"I love this bakeware. Medium weight, easy easy clean up -- great feature!!Speedy delivery, easy transaction and a happy customer."
3,Great deal for price,This product is perfect for the novice as well as the experienced cook. It is a great deal for the price that it is offered at.
5,Freestyle,I love freestyle and I definetly love this album.Best of the best.You gotta have this album if you like freestyle.
5,Such a fantastic cd @}->---,"This is one of my favourite 'oldies'. I'm such a fan of Georges, that I have all of his music. Bad Of The Heart is a great song in and of itself, but to me, the two standout songs are No Matter What (a beautful duet) and Without You. In fact, Without You is one of the best songs in the universe.Unfortunately, George isn't as popular as he really should be (considering that his voice is stunning) but trust me, that if you buy this, you will love it. I think some of his best work is on this cd and I'd love to hear new music from him, but till then, this will definately do."
5,STILL THE BEST IN 1999,"GEORGE LAMOND IS ONE OF THE GREATEST FREESTYLE SINGERS IN THE WORLD. I'VESEEN GEORGE PERFORM MANY TIMES,ESPECIALLY AT CLUB ESCAPES IN L.I.HE IS A GREAT PERFORMER AND HE IS STILLROCKIN IT IN 99"". LOVE YA"
2,"It had good songs, but most were boring.","I bought this CD because I heard he was a great artist of Freestyle, I even heard some of his songs on the radio. But when I bought this CD the only ones I liked were ""Look Into My Eyes"" and ""Without You."" Those are the ones I heard on the radio, I mean I could of just taped them, there always playing on KTU. It didn't even have the song ""Where Does that Leave Love""! I'd just buy the singles."
4,Why Secular Judaism doesn't make sense,"This is a great book. It explores the differences between Classical (Orthodox) Judaism and Secular (Reform) Judaism in a clear and straightforward way. Classical Rabbi Yosef Reinman engages in a dialog with Secular Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch. The dialog shows that Reinman's points are always better than Hirsch's ones, but I don't think that it is because Reinman is a better spokesman than Hirsch, but because Hirsch has the impossible mission of rationalize the secularization of Judaism. Hirsch lives in a relativistic world where majority decides what is true or right; Raiman lives in a world where G-d tells what is true or right through Torah. A wonderful reading!"
5,Should be required reading in all yeshivos,This is book is a masterpiece. I found the Reform perspective interesting but Rabbi Reinman's positions to be entirely convincing. The book has given me an understanding of Orthodox Judaism that 20 years of yeshiva education failed to accomplish. Orthodoxy is foolish to believe that the writings are anything to be afraid of.
3,the picture and description don't match,The description says that this is a 2400mAh battery but if you look closely in the picture you can read 2200mAh on the battery.
2,Not a great product,"These socks were exactly as they were described. The problem is they stretch out so quickly that they couldn't be worn more than five minutes before they were falling off. I don't think they're poor quality, it's just not a great choice in material for socks that need to stay up during vigorous game play. Plus they only came in two sizes, adult and youth. Seems like there should be more options, not all men have the same size feet."
3,"Fun for the kids, but not very durable!","My 3 year old son loves this game, but it's our second one due to the cords fraying/breaking. It has some limited educational value - need to find certain items in order to advance to another level - and mild violence - Batman does have to punch/kick/fight villans. A good thing is that the game actually has an end once all the villans are put behind bars (literally!). Also, your child can save the game to play later without having to start from the beginning. If your kid loves it as much as mine, you will want to stock up on double-A batteries! Another warning to parents -the music will drive you nuts after a few minutes of playing -- luckily, it can be turned off while the kid still plays the game!"
5,Jakks Pacific Toymax Batman Tv Game,I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas. He loves super heros. The game is challenging at best.. Some level are tricky but with practice he is able to beat Iceman levels...He went through 6 sets of batteries until we bought him his own rechargable set. Now he plays everyday and learning alot of angles to get Batman up on the top tiers....His 11 years old Uncle beat all the levels already.They play it alot.. Getting him Sponge Bob and Spiderman next... It keeps him off my computer so I can play games..
5,Can't go wrong with Global,"Another great knife from Global. This is a good knife for everyday use - especially for fruits and vegies. It can slice a tomato in perfect paper thin slices. Yes, it is true that other Global knives perform just as well, but it never hurts to have more than one Global in your kitchen."
5,"great knife, you only need this one","I am a huge cook. I cook a big meal every day for my family and sometimes two. While I own other good knives, I have only used this one knife for all my cooking needs for the past 4.5 years. I have never needed to sharpen it and it was used when I received it so it is over 5 years old."
5,Great Universal knife,I really have enjoyed using this knife. It is a great universal knife. It is nice to have when one needs to cut through chicken skin for deboning. I also like the design of the handel.
4,Excellent coverage of Japanese American military effort,"I found the book to be an excellent coverage of the Japanese American military effort during the Second World War. The book does more then relates the stories of the Japanese-American combat units but also go into other fields that these folks went into which proves to highly useful and valuable in the war effort. Serving as translators, working in military intelligence service and working on propagranda were all important duties served by the Japanese-American soldiers who often had to fight this war on two fronts....the enemies and their own side. I found the book to be well written, well researched and quite informative."
2,Vargas Llosa,"Even though Vargas Llosa is one of my favorite writers, I have negative comments about this book. It is very difficult reading, I could not finish it, it was kind of boring. The story wonders for too long...definitely not one of my favorite books."
3,complicated,mixed feelings about this one... very hard reading yet interesting style... tyring but somehow captivating... too difficult for me.
3,Listen to this before buying it...,"If new age synthesizer recordings are your thing then you might like this. Personally I much prefer leaving the synthesizer out of it, and using natural acoustic instruments.Just my 2 cents.But hey, some seem to love it and I'm sure the synth player has every good intention. It's just not my cup of tea. Try Jonathan Goldman's stuff."
5,So Soothing!,"I bought this CD in a used section at the store, for a silly reason, the cover was pretty & the chant-ress is the same name as my beloved Sophie pet. I listened to this the very first time & it's been my favorite of soothing music ever since. I listen to it when I'm trying to go to sleep, she lulls me to sleep after meditating through her music. Her voice is so beautiful, I may not know exactly what she's saying, (or at all), but I can hear her passion and I really feel that this music is so healing for me. I have since bought several of her cd's, I guess used bins aren't so bad! I love all cd's by Sophia & have never been dissapointed by any of them, although this one still remains my favorite. Just beautiful."
3,Great music...for awhile.,"I like this CD, I really do...the first 2 or 3 songs are absolutely captivating!!! Track 7 is pretty amazingly inspiring too. I just didn't feel that much listening enjoyment from the rest of the album. I don't feel like they are resonating with my chakras, just too much vibrato for my ears! I thought she had this great earthly sound for the first couple of tracks and then she got all frilly and way too feminine with her voice, for me. I've been listening to it for a couple of days so, if I change my mind about her I'll let you know ;) But for now, I'm enjoying the repetitiveness of tracks 1 and 2 for sure!"
5,Great Player for the price!!! Can't beat it...,"This upconverter works well in 720p/1080i, however it really depends on the recorded bitrate of the actual DVD you are viewing. The memory card viewer works well in displaying pictures, but its kinda slow for big pictures. This player comes with two HDMI cables: HDMI to HDMI, and DB15(VGA) to HDMI. Slim design is nice as well since it will fit in many small places. Good product over all."
2,"When it works, it looks nice","I bought this unit several months ago and have had many problems. It's very fussy about discs, even new ones. I'd say about 1 in 4 discs just would not load (though they would sometimes load after several tries but there was no rhyme or reason). Beyond the problem of recognizing discs, My remote completely stopped working after about 4 months of use, rendering the player virtually useless. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the picture was so nice... when it worked."
1,not worth the time effort or money,the DVD played for about 2 mo then it wouldn't recognize a DVD.No RCA products have ever worked at their best.
5,Tu Rex Gloriae,"And I thought I was the one who wrote gnostic reviews!No doubt about it: the Charpentier Te Deum is masterpiece. God is conceived as Louis XIV at the height of his fame with more of an emphasis on majesty than mysticism. It is white hot with an inspiration that I find somewhat lacking in other works by this composer. Not once does it falter. When the trumpet returns at the end to embellish the 'non confundar in aeternam', it is 'ejector-seat time' from whatever you are doing in a mere physical sense.The other works on this disc are not on the same level. Mention should be made of 'Tenebrae Factae Sunt' where bass Phillipe Huttenlocher is suitably vesperal and desolate.Note: the recording is exemplary; the soloists are stylish and a modern-day orchestra is employed (unlike Christie) but it does not matter: as soon as the trumpet rings out in the Prelude, one forgets such considerations to wallow in transcendence."
3,Works Great-When it doesn't freeze up!,"I have tried every RCA DVD/VCR recorder that has come out & I've had to return them all.I finally decided to stick to recording on my VCR when this model came out.It had wonderful reviews when I purchased it.At first I thought I had found my Dream Machine!Now,it records 1 movie Great on a DVD+R disc,but when I record a second movie on the same disc it freezes completely up when I try to turn it back on,so far I've been able to unplug it to get it back on, you do lose the clock though.I gave it 3 stars because the way I see it,the RCA machines lose time & you have to reset the clock on them at least once a week anyway.I guess I'll keep this one because after Christmas I won't be recording so many movies.I haven't tried to copy my tapes,you'll hear back if there's any problems.I think I'll just record 1 movie per disc!"
1,stay away,"probably the worst piece of electronics we ever bought. bad vhs quality, bad vhs copying, does not pick up our tv signal with a disc in so we have not been able to record any TV shows. BUY SOMETHING ELSE. we sent this to the electronic recycler after a few months!"
1,junque,"recorded just five disks.Then, it ""freezes"" on future recordings. Requires removal of power cord to ""reset"".Many features, but the basic ones do not work.I have two other DVD recorders that work well. The RCA does not.***UPDATE*** after six weeks in RCA authorized repair, and four follow-up phone calls, they seem to have fixed the problem."
1,Worst POS Ever,I have lived with this POS for too long. It has always refused to turn on so I have had to unplug it and then plug it back in. It has a random time generator and so shows the time of day in whatever time zone it feels like that day. It used to at least record on DVD with some consitancy but has now decided that none of the discs previously recorded can be played. It refuses to play any movie on DVD and won't even recognize a VHS tape. I'd like to say what I think of RCA in general and the RCA product engineers but that might get me arrested.
1,Deffective product followed by VERY BAD customer service,"Like many of the others, my machine also froze with a DVD still inside after only a couple of months use. When it would not reset, I was told to send it in to Thompson/RCA for repair or replacement. Not only would they not pay for the shipping, but they lost it! After two months of me calling them repeatedly, they reported that they could not repair it and would buy it back at a prorated price(not the full price I paid). So not only was I not going to be able to replace the product, I was also out the $30 it cost to ship it (not to mention two months wait time & countless hours of phone calls)."
3,Poor user manual,"When I receivee the RCA unit, the user manual was a big disappointment. It was small, and the printing was so small you have to use a magnifying glass.It was printed in mexico.I ordered manual which I hope will be a much better copy. I ordered it on Aug 20 and still havent received it. So I havent had a chance to use the RCA unit to date until I receive a satisfactory manual."
3,origins and framework....but apparent lack of understanding.,"Chevannaes provides a very in-depth look at the societal situations that gave rise to Rastafari. While discussing those situations, however, it seems to me that his mind did not come to the same conclusion as the Rastafarians. To write on Rastafari without understanding the mindstate leaves the reader with much to be desired.To his credit though, Chavannaes never really attempts such an interpretation. He is a social antropologist, and writes this book in an occupationally fitting academic manner.To better understand Rastafari as a mentality...listen to Bob Marley. To better understand Rastafari as you would an American history course....read this book. Both forms of learning are legitimate, and i think my overall disappointment in this book came from me expecting the former while receiving the latter. It's a good history book....but thats just not what i was looking for."
3,COMPLICATED BUT VERY THOROUGH,THIS BOOK IS A VERY DETAILED LOOK INTO THE LIFE OF RASTAFRIANISM. AT TIMES IT SEEMS TO DRAG ALOT ALMOST TOO MUCH WHICH TAKES MY ATTENTON AWAY FROM WHAT IM READING. YOU HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT WITH THIS BOOK IN ORDER TO READ IT. IT ALOST SEEMS MORE OF LIKE A TEXT BOOK ON RASTAFARI. I WOULD SUGGEST THE BOOK RASTA HEART BY ROBERT ROSKIND OVER THIS ONE BECAUSE IT IS MORE READER FRIENDLY AND YOU DONT WANNA PUT THE BOOK DOWN. BUT OVERALL THIS BOOK HAS ALOT OF LUCRATIIVE INFORMATION THAT CAN CAPTIVATE THE WELL READ MIND JUST DONT TAKE TOO MUCH INFO IN BECAUSE YOU MIGHT GET A HEADACHE.ONE LOVEJAH BLESS
4,Bose's Game Changing Product,"This is the device that came out in the 1980's (with casstette) and always impressed me with the sound quality. Certainly this was an important product with regards to Bose success with the clock radio.It sounds better the louder you play it and the further away you are. I got a OK deal but it came with three different remotes, plus I bought the optional remote (don't).The FM tuner is still pretty bad, as it was years ago, but I use it for playing MP3's mostly. It should have a HD FM tuner for this much money, although I understand this may be replaced soon. The free CD changer is useless to me with my music server.B l a s t i t L O U D and you will love it!"
3,Disappointing,"I have been looking forward to acquring one of these for a while. I have to confess I am sending it back.It's not that it isn't a very good piece of kit; I like it, it sounds perfectly fine but it doesn't sound any better than what I already have ( a Denon D65 with Kef Coda speakers). Therefore I can't justify the expense. Also, at low volume I could hear the tick-tick turning of the CD mechanism - this would really irritate me on a high spec system."
1,Very Disappointed,after the warrenty ran out the display went out. great sound but disappointed in their electronics. when i took it apart to get parts it say made in mexico. i love their speaker but will never buy anything but speakers again. Cant get parts to fix it.disappointed in lansing michian
2,Bose Acoustic Wave 2,"I 've had the Bose CD3000 for over 5 years. It is a good player for outdoor use. However, do not spend 1100 dollars on this system for home use. It is only adequate. First, there are no sound adjustments to make other than the volume. Second, the base output is ok but you must have the unit perched where there is a wall behind it to enhance the bass. It is just like any other boombox when placed against the wall. Finally,because most of the music is going to downloads and uploading to IPOD systems this unit is outdated. The top loading CD has a tendency to open when not in use. While the CD player is there, I doubt that it is going to be used much.For 1100 dollars there are better investments out there."
1,BOSE - terrible international warranty customer service,"Don't buy this product if you are planning to take it outside USA, I bought this Accoustic Wave Music System II last year and took 6 months for Bose to replace the product. I hope that Bose take this very seriously and improve the warranty process and service better the international locations."
2,WAAAYY To Expensive,"Returned it. OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS? Verdamte Sheise!Yea the sounds ""good and rich"" but for ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS????? uhhh no way. (hence the overall 3.4/5.0 rating)"
3,Too much for too little,Bose must be laughing all the way to the bank with the gullibility of everyone who buys his system. The electronics is basic and low quality. The SINGLE CD player is shoddy. The tube resonating sound system is simple and harkens back to Henry Fords model T - any color as long as it is black but of course for Bose it's my noise without modification. The simple system for the simple minded and at the same low price of $1000. The price was too much when it first came out and it is ridicules for today.
2,No highs no lows it must be a Bose,I aquired one with credit card points...no cash outlay and that was about the right price. There is nothing exceptional about the sound from the System II. For the money there are better options.
3,Good boom box.,"I have the 1st AW1 with a tape player I bought around 1990. I have never had any reliability problems but I use it as a boom box. So 20 years is pretty good reliability. Beware Bose will not sell you any part if it goes bad. I wanted tape player belts and they refuse to sell it. This is so their repair centers can extort a labor charge for repair. So you are buying a $1000 almost disposable product. One time I called Mcintosh for a var diode and they sent it to me free of charge. Now that is service. Bose was more than willing to sell me a new discounted Wave rather than sell me $3 worth of rubber belts. Also, the 901 speaker surrounds rot out."
3,Hmmm...,"After seeing the 5 star review previously written for this book I was really looking forward to reading it. The book did keep me interested but there really wasn't much ""romance"" to it. The story was basically about a man who needed to heal emotionally and physically after a tragic car accident that took the life of his ex-wife and left him weak and scarred. The heroine played nurse maid."
3,eh-so what,"Well this is one of those products you look forward to and get it and go so what. And then too, I got a little tired of Tom being so full of himself. Also there just wasn't enough music. Actually I would give it 2.5 stars. I watched it twice just to make sure, eh, so I gave it away."
1,Numerous errors in this compilation,"Mr. Alliss would probably be ashamed to have his name attached to a book with as many errors as this one -- and I'm only up to page 24! In addition to some of the ones listed in another review, Ben Hogan (a) won the Masters before, not after, the US Open in 1951, and he did not finish 2nd in the 1960 US Open (Jack Nicklaus did, as an amateur). What a way to pay tribute to one of the game's greats.Fortunately, I bought this one for $3 on a clearance rack, but I still consider it wasted money. Not even worthy of a bathroom book, in my opinion."
3,Generally interesting,"Held my interest. I found the various locations to be enthralling. But I, too, was put off by the several typos I found. That shouldn't appear in any published work.The book itself was fairly well done. Recommended for hard core enthusiasts."
1,Save your money,"Very disappointing. Nothing new in this and I suspect, little that has been contributed by Alliss. It's just a cut and paste of very well known bits - anyone who has read more than 5 golf books (not instruction books) will know 98% of what's in this one. It also has numerous typographical errors suggesting a sloppy job overall - Billy Caspar (Casper), George von Elme (it's Elm I think), Ledbetter (Leadbetter), it has Gene Sarazen ""chipping"" from a bunker on the Postage Stamp hole at Troon which is possible but doubtful, and Chick Evans playing in 50 consecutive 'Amateur Opens' (an oxymoron, Amateur Championship is surely meant). There are other errors but I read the whole thing in an hour looking for something of interest and found none."
5,Filling my cup,"The latest C.D. of Cece Winans Alabaster Box is a wonderfull C.D. to listen to . I play it everyday but, the one song on this C.D. that just bring tears to my eyes, well really it's two ""He's not on his knees yet"" and ""It wasn't easy"" ""Alabaster Box"" is very touching also but, I don't want to sound like a dummy but, I'm only 20 and I don't really understand those three songs but, yet it gets into my soul and bring out my inter love for god. Thank You Cece for making this touching C.D.Katherine"
5,This is the One!,"If you're going thru some hard times and it is beginning to affect you emotionally and mentally....Listen to this CD. It will bring you great relief in the spiritual words used and the uplifting beats heard. You'll find yourself giving praise before you know it, and remember this too shall pass.....;-) Oh yea! EXCELLENT CONDITION!!! Hard cover!"
5,the cd is an in your face true gospel album,"this cd is truly a follow up to alone in his presence. and after the negative responses to critics for everlastin love which only was a people's choice, cece answers their bickering of with the power house alabaster box. cece demonstrates why her family is the reigning family of gospel, giving us that sweet cool winans flavor on every song. Each out does the other and cece's angelic powervoice will make you have chills down your spine as she shines on each note, and will truly bless u in the ministry of the gospel. waste no time. go and get this new cd by cece."
5,Cece for mature audiences,"While everyone has always acknowledged Cece's gift as being one of the premier singers in ALL of music today, her last two albums have had a slant towards reaching a younger audience. ""Alabaster Box"" gives the more mature folks something to grasp, while it still remains accessable to Cece's younger fans. The fact that a variety of producers were involved, gives this CD a much more eclectic flavor. I highly recommend this CD as one of the best of the year!"
1,ALABASTER BOX,I am a loyal fan of CeCe Winans 's album since 1997. I just wana say she has done it again. Her new release titled alabaster box is one of the most hottest song of all her albums. I would always loved Cece because she was called by the mighty God to sing gospel to reach out the world and she responded. May God bless cece and everybody who listens to her song.Amen!
4,"Excellent blade, small handle","As with all Global knives, the blade is outstanding. The handle on this knife is really too small though. I'm a man with medium sized hands and a touch of arthritis and find that it can be a bit cramp inducing to peal more than a few pieces of fruit with this knife. Our other Global knives are excellent to my hand."
4,"Nimble, light, sharp","This replaced my Henckel 4 inch paring knife, which could never stay sharp. So for the Global works a treat. I'll probably need to get a stone to keep it as sharp as it was when it arrived, but a standard steel keeps it easily sharp enough to use. I don't know why I ever hesitated to buy one."
2,Engineering for Dairy and Food Products,"This book does not contain any ""meat"", I'm sure in 1963 the book was great. It suggests using lead solder, which as we now know will leach into the milk. Throughout the book it contains problems such as this. The last publication was 1980, I don't believe much Engineering editing occured. It is outdated....P>Roy Metzger, BSEESr. Food Process Engineer."
3,Maybelline Brush/Mascara,The mascara is okay.The brush is too thick.I exchange it by using the brush from the Great Lash brand.Have always been more satisfied with Maybelline over any mascara out there.
2,Hate it.,"I always use Full N Soft mascara, but I didn't realize this is not the washable waterproof. This is like putting black water on your eyelashes, very disappointed."
5,Perfect!,"I found this mascara while searching through the makeup products on amazon. It is exactly identical to the Maybelline Full N Soft Mascara that they sell in every drug store, but this one was a lot cheaper. Product came in a very timely manner with no damage or problems at all. Would highly recommend to anyone who knows what they want and wants to save money as well!"
4,[...]/barropanama,i really like this one... but for real.. they get better with time.. so im waiting for beautiful death machine... mad child is a lil genious
4,Underground Hit,"When i first heard this album i was blown away by the lyrical genius of swollen members, especially Mad Child.Who was once homeless and living in the cd store where he worked in Canada...That was until he appeared on a track with Q-bert called 'Pregnant'...Mad Child, Prevail And Moka Only formed the group, before Moka decided to leave the group to pursue a solo career. First Lp Balance was a worldwide underground hit and left people hanging for their next release which came the next year.Stand out tracks are Fuel Injected, Camouflage, Dark Riders, and Bad Dreams ...you can tell they were dungeons and dragons playing nerds when they were at school,but that just adds to their individuality...definately an album to get a hold of along with the first Lp Balance...."
3,"Sophmore Jinx, I wish it wasn't true.","I believe Swollen has caught the sophmore jinx. After listening to Balance this albam was a let down for me. I don't know what happened to Mad Child on this one, he sounds wack on almost 50% of the album. His lyrics are too simple, everything just sounds wrong to me. Prev 1 on the other hand has surpassed Mad Child, I think he holds this album together along with Rob the Viking. Everyone who has the Balance album knows Mad Child is supposed to be the better of the 2 lyrically, on this album instead of his skills increasing they have decreased. If you guys (Swollen Members)read this, don't missunderstand me I still liked the album I just wish the old Mad Child was back, thats all. Due to the fact there is a good amount of bangin tracks like Full Contact, Dark Riders, and Killing Spree, I give a reasonable 3 stars, which is not bad."
4,Ride to this,"I heard DEEP END on Matchstick Production's High Society: set to Tanner Hall flowing down a mountain in slow motion, hitting trix along the way down.And I thought, that's a good sound for a good segment of a good ski movie. I bought this cd and was happily suprised with this canadian rap. It's not conventional rap, it's more flowing, with more of a beat and rythym, and the ryming is clever. It's a cd that one can RIDE TO.My favorite tracks are DEEP END, BAD DREAMS, VENTILATE, SNAKE BITE, TAKE IT BACK, and CAMOUFLAGE.'Cause those are the trax you can ride to...Madchild's gotta be the only rapper who'd be interviewed bc of his riding skills and love in Canadian Snowboard. So it's all good...you can ski and drive to it to. Their second cd, Monsters in the Closet, is good, but this one, BAD DREAMS is excellent.Pump it up on your headphones and it's like I'm on the hill, carving down through the powder. Not that mass holes see alot of powder..."
5,Just plain good,"Swollen has done it again!!! This CD is way better than the last.It has the best songs including Killing Spree, Burns and Scars and Deep End. Only thing is that it is a kind of dark album. Next time around, they should try to change that. If you are a fan of rap and liked their last effort, you will not be sad. A must have for everyone!!!"
5,Just about perfect!,"I loved my 8 inch Global chef knife so much I ordered this veggie knife. Oh wow, this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies. It also fits in your hand extremely well. If you are going to cut up a potato, it is hard to beat the chef's knife. However, for cutting up a tomato, carrot, etc. this thing is the best tool I have ever used. Just wonderful!"
2,If you are looking for inspiration to sail around the world this is not the book.,"This is the story of a rich woman with a husband that takes a sabbatical, so he can sail around the world. They start out with a good boat then decide that it is not big enough and by a brand new ""big"" one. Lots of stories about other peoples shipwrecks and pirates, playing golf and tennis along the way.It is not a bad book but she does not have much to say other than she enjoyed the voyage and loved to live the good life."
3,Great start,"I loved the adventure described by Ms. Blodgett. The first half of the book was very captivating, but the author seemed to fizzle out towards the end leaving a lot of unanswered questions."

1,"light, cheap construction","This looked pretty in the box, but I was surprised to find that it is made of light, cheesy plastic (ie ""polycarbonate and reinforced nylon). I need a corkscrew with some heft to it, not that feels like it's going to snap the first time I use it. Didn't even bother trying it, sent it back."
3,Nice product,It takes a couple of tries but once you get it right the cork does come right out neatly and cleanly.
2,"poor design, don't buy","Have owned the original larger metal version, handle is longer and gives you more leverage. Only problem was the plastic piece that holds the screw in place broke in half and made the whole device useless.This unit is much smaller and foil cutter does not work well. It is just junk in my opinion."
2,Plastic. Looks very cheap.,"The construction and finish of this corkscrew look very cheap. This is NOT made of any kind of metal. Although PAINTED silver, giving some sort of metal look, the body and handles are plastic. I can't comment on the item's durability because of the fact that I chose to return it. But if you ask me to guess based on the looks, I would say it doesn't look like it would last long."
1,"Good start, bad end","My unit worked just fine for some time. Then, presumably after some of the tighter corks were pulled, it felt like some part became slightly misaligned so the pull became a bit harder. I kind of anticipated that eventually it will break in some way not the way it did. What happened was that the lever broke in my hand when I was pulling the cork. The sharp edges of plastic at the break point went deep into my hand leaving two deep flesh wounds. I lost quite a bit of blood and was in pain for two days every moment I touched the area.Perhaps it is worthwhile to invest in a device made of steel or cast iron.I left a message describing the episode at Metrokane's web site but they didn't bother to answer."
1,JUNK,The RABBIT worked great until the plastic handles broke!You would think at this price they would be made out of something stronger. Would never buy this again.
3,"Corkscrew works fine, but...","the plastic case that it's stored in was badly cracked when my wife opened the box. The box didn't seem damaged, so I'm left wondering why the seller possibly sent us a cracked case."
2,rabbit,"Pulling corks from the bottle is very fast; however, removing the cork from the rabbit is a hassle."
5,Very Useful for Collectors of Roman Coins!,"This book by Zander H. Klawans, published in 1953, is perhaps the best resource on doing exactly what its title says. It is short, and every word and illustration is clear and to the point. It summarizes the information in clear tables, thumbnail biographies, and descriptions. I don't think that I am exaggerating when I say that every collector of Roman coins should have this book, although, due to the fact that it is out of print, this may not be possible."
5,The first album in the Ann Horstick series,Her performance of Somewhere in Time alone is worth the price of this CD which set the tone for the others that followed. Her CDs are quickly becoming collector items as this talented artist is no longer living but her music continues on.
2,One glaring omission,"I thought I was going to like this book, and in fact it does cover most of the topics fairly well. It is well-organized and includes a useful CD. But it has one GLARING omission: no discussion, not even a mention, of inserting pictures. So if you have scanned images or images from a digital camera, you won't get any help from this book. This is such a common use for Powerpoint that I kept thinking I was mistaken, but it's just not there. Animation, sound files, clip art, Word Art, graphics you draw -- all are covered, but photographs and scanned images (i.e., JPEGs, GIFs, TIFFs, etc.) don't get a mention. This powerful capability of Powerpoint is my associates' (university faculty and physician-educators) stock in trade, and the real reason they use Powerpoint. Sadly, the book spends a huge amount of space on what is really trivial decoration - clip art images and Word Art. What do the author's think is important? Why do they think we use Powerpoint?"
3,It was an OK read.,"Some of imagery was fairly good in explaing some of the scenes. I almost feel like I was there. Then other times I felt as though I was just left to dangle, bored by what I was reading. I didn't feel as though the author put that much heart into it."
3,A Human Galactic Empire You Wish to Collapse So To Be Reborn,"In the depressing world the author has set up, our main character is called off to manage an off world site that ends up being a key site in the war the galactic empire has with this unknown alien race. Earth and the empire its founded is so hallow, you almost don't care that it is at risk of being destroyed, and that I think is in part what Gregory Benford strived for. The culture that the empire is based upon cares more for protocol than actual deeds and this has the potential to lead to disgrace for the competent. Discovering what this alien race is, how to defeat them if possible, and why they are at war becomes a key part of the plot. There are more subtle issues as well, that being the analogy of this empire with a failing marriage that I thought I sensed and which turns out Benford refers to at the very end in his author's note."
3,Am I the only one with the black spot,"This fits like a glove, but every picture i took had a dark spot in the bottom when i had this adapter on. I have 2 S3IS's and it happens to both of them, other than that my lenses fit perfectly."
1,charge dock is lame,"Everytime this shaver needs a charge it is a major pain. It is like the shaver does not have enough weight to make a solid contact to the AC prongs or blades. I have to use a rubber band of the correct length and stretch to keep the contact solid = MAJOR DESIGN FLAW! I got tired of the ""rubber band recharge the shaver"" hassle and went back to the triple rotor blade company.The Wahl 4000 misses too much compared to the triple rotor design. I have to use a Mach 3 or 4 bladed razor to finish up which means I'm buying blades.I still use the Wahl 4000, (when it is charged) to shave the nubs after I shave my head - the tripe rotor does a better job on top too."
2,Have 2 other Wahl products (not this one) - cheaply made,"Wahl's products are inexpensive and you get what you pay for. Cheap plastic, cheap contacts in battery-operated models that quickly corrode and need constant cleaning, useless plastic accessories. Think of their products as disposable and you'll probably be satisfied."
3,Fair - too flimsy,"This turned out to be more flimsy than we had hoped. Gets some use, but not too often. Main straps are WAY too long, too! We had to cut them in order not to drag or double wrap."
5,Quality,"I was worried these would be cheapy, because of the price, but I was wrong. We just used them the first time with 14-18 year olds, and they were great. Think they will last for 50 games."
3,MISSING THE 3RD LIVE DISC!,"If you have any notion of buying this great set, look at the used listings for the earlier, limited edition, now OOP,3CD BBC set. It contains a fabulous live disc recorded at the BBC London Theatre 06/27/00 that this later edition does not have. Check out the tracklist for the live disc:Disc: 31. Wild Is The Wind2. Ashes To Ashes3. Seven4. This Is Not America5. Absolute Beginners6. Always Crashing In The Same Car7. Survive8. Little Wonder9. Man Who Sold The World10. Fame11. Stay12. Hallo Spaceboy13. Cracked Actor14. I'm Afraid Of Americans15. Let's DanceAs of this writing, the OOP 3CD is available here on Amazon for less, used, than this 2-disc set, new. Don't pass up the opportunity to get the live CD. The audio is first rate, and the performance is excellent."
2,Changes my mood,"I have tried a few fat burners before but I thought I would try this one because its cheaper. This one doesn't have any stimulants which is alright for me because I'll end up getting plenty of caffeine in other ways. The first few days I took this I seemed to be in a bad mood. Admittedly I'm not a very happy person at work, but I felt genuinely pissed off at the world. As soon as I stopped taking it, I felt back to normal. Since I wasn't ready to give up on a cheap fat burner, I tried four more times going on and off the product. There is no question that it definitely has a negative effect on my mood. I lost a few pounds but I wasn't taking it consistently enough to know if it was from the pills. I'm sure the product affects everyone differently but I won't be taking it anymore."
5,The Mud Daubers,"I have just finished reading The Mud Daubers and I can't say enough good things about it. I could hardly put it down and I was sorry to have it come to an end. The story and the characters were both presented in such a way that you lived the story with them and the background had obviously been well-researched. There was both romance and history, both presented in a low-key way, and in a way that captured your interest. I highly recommnd it!"
5,A Good Read,"Mud Daubers took me back into the 1800s and not only gave me a history lesson on the Memphis area, but a suspenseful story as well---and allowed me to experience the lives of some interesting and decidedly Southern characters. I was sorry when it ended.John Cardwell"
2,This book is mis-titled.,"Satin is a dyed-in-the-wool extreme progressive liberal from the 60s and 70s who has somehow deluded himself into thinking he has morphed to the middle of politics, then he wrote a book about it. The title really should be ""Radical Liberalism... Repackaged"", because that's really all it is. Essentially he talks a lot about government hand-outs to give people a head start in life then taxing the rich to pay for it. The same old liberal schtick, just in a different form.The only thing that earns a second star is that he does have a few seemingly original good ideas, but they are rare, and most are unworkable anyway. I was highly disappointed by the book."
5,Remodel,peeled up saltillio tile well and vinyl flooring with ease. takes some work to get used to vibration. much easier than on your knees all day 'for chisel'......
2,Not up to Connelley's usual standards,"I always look forward to Connelley's books, but generally find the set-up better than the resolution. Angels Flight is one of his weakest. Connelley doesn't develop any characters in the cast of suspects, so the solution elicits a big ""So what."" The subplots are predictible, while the major plot points seem random. And we don't learn anything new about the Harry Bosch character. I get the feeling that Connelley's publisher was simply racing to get this one out in time for Christmas. (Even the editing is sloppy -- the main action in the book takes place in the streets near the Museum of Contemporary Art in L.A -- known to everyone in town as MOCA -- but Connelley refers to it as the Museum of Modern Art)."
1,Careful!!,Buyer beware! This Kindle edition does not have Text-to-speech enabled. I don't know why the text-to-speech was enabled in the first five. its very disappointing
5,Top Quality Crime Fiction,"Connelly is on top form in this installment of the Harry Bosch series. Angel&#65533;s Flight, a suspenseful tale of murder and police corruption in Los Angeles, a city on the brink of imploding, is one of Connelly&#65533;s best. As usual, the characterizations are superb. Bosch and gang are memorable in the pursuit of a murderer that could be from their own ranks and the depiction of LA is atmospheric and grimly realistic. I highly recommend this for fans of crime fiction."
5,Best Connelly ever,"Michael Connelly continues to turn out one fantastic read after another. Having read all his works to date, Angels Flight is, by far, his best yet. I have never read an author that can hold the readers interest as well as Connelly can. It seems that he writes his books to you, not at you. I'm very fortunate to have found this outstanding writer and story teller. Give us another remarkable story soon, Michael."
4,Uneven,"Just finished the book this morning. I will buy every book he puts out because of the first of his I read - ""The Poet"". I have come away from it as though I have just left a group of familiar friends - glad to have been with them again. I found the book not as fast-paced as I would have liked until the last 50-75 pages. It seems to me the author did not ""take the time"" as he did with ""The Poet"" and even ""Trunk Music"". Enjoyable read but not exceptional."
4,This is an ok Harry Bosch book,"I enjoyed this book because I have known the area around Angels Flight for many years, so understand their movements around the area. It's an ok 'private eye' book."
4,Great read,Great read not too flow just enought movement with the story line to keep you interested in where the different characters play their roll
4,Harry Bosch going strong.,"Bosch is still the man in Los Angeles, now with a case that no one in the Los Angeles' Police Department wants solved. True to form, Harry doesn't let us down and keeps us reading to the very end. How does Connelly come up with his twists and turns? I kept turning the pages way past me stop on the train and loved the fact that it gave me few more minutes to solve the plot along with LA's greatest. Keep writing, I am on my way to buy Void Moon."
5,Harry Bosch does not dissapoint,Angel's Flight is another wonderful thriller/mystery from Michael Connelly. Harry Bosch i called upon to solve the murder of a scummy civil rights attorney who made his living by suing cops. The books has wonderful plot twists and is interesting from start to finish. I just love Harry Bosch and Michael Connelly.
3,Not up to par,"Michael Connelly has surrended to the New York editors who demand a book a year, no matter if what the writers ends up writing is trash they would never buy from a new author. This story is the weakest of his output. Does not measure up to The Last Coyote or Black Echo. Michael stand your ground! Don't turn out garbage!"
2,Nahhh- not great,"First book by Connelly-he's no Coban or Patterson and Lee Child is his daddy. Bosch character is robotic, unrealistic not likeable and not human. So far 1/2 through the book. Good story and premise but slow moving Bosch has no real personality Reminds me of SGT Friday on Dragnet- just the facts He's doesnt sleep eat or other human characterics. Bad writing. The book isnt fun. I want to get this read and done with to try Marshall Karp If this is one of Connelly's best - 4 1/2 stars, geesh I can't imagine the others Connelly fans: Move on to Lee Child. Even Patterson's understudy- Andrew Gross is far more compelling in his story telling and making the characters rich and likeable Bosch- Connelly- blehh!!"
5,Rad,"This is one of the best Connelly novels yet, he is a master. I have them all and I keep pacing myself so that I do not read them too fast."
5,Great story; weak ending.,"Micheal, you did it again! You rushed the ending of ""Bloodwork"" and then did likewise with ""Angels Flight."" You made me feel as if you were tired of writing and thought, ""Hey, just lemme find a way to finish this thing."" Don't get me wrong -- I enjoyed the novel immensely, as I have all of your others. On another note, isn't it about time you followed up on the whereabouts of special agent Robert Backus (from ""The Poet"")? I keep checking the L.A. storm drains, expecting him to emerge at any time. Don't leave us fans wondering, Michael."
4,Finely Tuned Suspense,This is an intricate and well told suspense novel. Harry Bosch is one of my favorite characters and he does not disappoint in this story. Connelly has a way of baiting the reader with mysteries within mysteries which keeps the interest high and the pace rapid. An extremely enjoyable read.
3,Has Connelly Lost His Edge?,"While I eagerly awaited Bosch's return in Angels Flight I was somewhat disappointed in what I found between the covers. I hate to have to give this book a mediocre review.Where did the Harry that I had grown to love go? It seemed as though his gritty, hard edged character has softened and in doing so become a bit bland.I honestly, had to skim through several parts of this book because I just couldn't get into it. I am a huge fan of Connelly's and I just hope that Void Moon will take us back to the Connelly we know and love - hey, everyone is allowed to make a mistake, right?If you are a Bosch fan then you should read Angels Flight but if not go back a read some of Connelly's older books first."
5,One of his best,"I saw that several reviews said that the books ""started slow,"" which I disagree with. Given the storyline, the beginning is intentionally and appropriately paced based on the developments in the case. It does gradually build and has what I think is a great ending.Overall, one of his best."
4,Another Great Connelly Read,"The Bosch series just continues to get better with each book. I thought Angels Flight started out just a little slow, but once the pace picked up, it really got rolling. Connelly is a master at this genre, developing believeable plot and side storylines and producing characters with depth. I have no intention of stopping here - gonna keep reading all the Bosch books in order."
4,a fine thriller,"Angels Flight involves a case of a murdered civil rights lawyer and a possibly unrelated bystander on a train track. Detective Bosch takes the lead on the case only to discover that it is connected to another case, one of a murdered child. His trust in his ""own people"" is shaken as he suspects that police brutality and murder may indeed be happening right under his nose and being committed by people he never suspected. The book is a difficult one to read due to much brutality, child abuse, and Bosch' marriage falling apart."
4,Couldn't put it down!!!!!,This was the first Michael Connelly book I read and I was quite pleased. It kept my attention until the very end when I still had a few surprises in store for me. I wish the relationship btw his wife and Bosch had taken a different road but...... I guess nothing every works out perfect. I look forward to reading more of his novels in the future.
4,Another Great Hieronomous Read,"Another good job!, Not his best, but by no means his worst book, well worth the money, especially at Amazon rates!"
3,Not One of Connelly's Best Bosch Novels,"I have read a number of the Harry Bosch novels and have to say that this was bland. The threat of another LA riot over the brutal death of a prominent lawyer is constantly looming in the background. Bosch and his two partners have unearthed plenty of evidence, but some disappears. The only way to appease the public and not cause another riot is to sacrifice a white police officer. However, when Bosch's friend commits ""suicide,"" he does not bring justice for him or his family. He is too busy with his home life and kicking his smoking habit that he forgets his motto that ""everyone counts."" I enjoyed reading the novel, but it was not up to par.I bought this as a kindle edition and it's hard to believe that it was 474 pages. Only 84 percent was the book; the rest was promos for other works."
3,Ruined Harry Bocsh for me.,"Spoiler AlertThe actions of the antagonists are so deplorable you can't wait to see how they will be exposed and punished. Although punishments are somewhat satisfying. In the end, Harry agrees to a cover-up to keep his job that allows the guilty to remain unexposed. The ending was so disappointing I couldn't believe it was actually the end. It's almost as if Connolly was up against a deadline and phoned it in. The fact that he didn't expose specific actions of other characters actually ruined the character for me."
4,"Tight, tense and vivid... Twisting and unpredictable...","Bosch continues his love/hate relationship with the City of Angels. Great crime novel; Tightly, tensely woven; plenty of twists to keep you interested till you've turned the final page. Plus: living in Los Angeles, the historic locations where the novel is set got me interested in further exploring its ecclectic sites and personality... LA is one of the primary characters that makes this book rock! Connelly's tops."
3,Strong novel with a weak ending,"Wonderfully complex yet logical plot leads from one red herring to another without stop.Harry stands like a stone wall, unperturbed by the chaos and killings and police intrigue flowing around him.However, I must warn the reader that the ending does not make for a satisfying conclusion to the novel."
3,Good with a difficult ending.,I've always liked Harry. This one had a good plot. Good characters. I especially liked the relationship stuff between Eleanor and Harry. But the ending bothered me -- morally questionable.
2,Ridiculously Complex Explanation for the Central Crime,I finally slogged through this thing and I only finished because I finish 98.5% of all the books I start. It is full of chapter after chapter where absolutely nothing happens garnished with an ultimately meaningless red herring or two. The final explanation calls for such complex planning and execution with such precise detail that I would have preferred the author just say grey aliens beamed down and killed the two victims. It would have been easier to swallow. Early on the author has the LAPD Inspector General commit two felonies by destroying evidence in a murder case which Bosch quickly uncovers and still he sits still while she repeatedly gives him an ACLU approved lecture on the need to watch those dirty cops. he doesn't just let her get away with this smug holier than thou attitude he seems to partially buy it. Pitiful. I still like the Lincoln Lawyer series but I'm finished with trying to like the new improved Bosch.
2,Very Disappointing,"My least favorite Connelly book. I think he's taken Harry as far as he can go. The stopped-smoking and wife-leaving sub plots are boring, and the red herrings are too obvious. The attempt to pull actual headline fodder into the overall mix (OJ, JonBenet, etc) are too easy and seem manipulative. Connelly can, has had done, much better. ""The Poet"" & ""Blood Work"", which were not about Harry, are much better plotted and paced."
2,Disappointing effort for this Harry Bosch fan.,"Readers who give ""Angels Flight"" five stars obviously have not read Connelly's earlier Bosch stories and his other works (ie, ""The Poet). Those were 5 star efforts."
4,An all-night read!,"Connelly is one of those rare authors who can keep me up all night and not have me regret it in the morning. I have enjoyed all the Harry Bosch stories and this one is particularly well-crafted save for a climactic mob scene near the end which I found both predictable and overdone. The murder mystery is wonderful, though, and Connelly knows how to unravel the clues without giving too much away. Sadly, it's going to be a very long wait now until the next Harry Bosch story appears."
5,Superb plot with a great LAPD story-line.,Once again Michael Connely has provided his followers with a novel that you can't put down... but don't really want it to end either. The characters are perfect and political tone is accurate LA.
4,Connelly's best Bosch novel yet!!!,"With each Bosch novel, Connelly has been able grab the reader's attention until the very last page. Angel's Flight is one of his best written novels thus far. Should you choose to read Angel Flight, turn off the ringer on your phone and don't answer the door!!!"
4,It is ok,I like him as a writer yet this novel was ok; it is not the best suspense novel you ever read. A bit predictable and he could do better. I enjoyed being entertained by him.
4,A bit overrated.,"Well written but I was a little disappointed because I lived in LA at the time. There were a few annoying errors in the way the city was depicted. There aren't any houses as high as he suggested. The higher hills don't have houses on them. It sounds believable but isn't. Not as bad as Chasing the Dime where he depicted Santa Monica College as being intellectual. Connelly was the perfect author for the Clinton years. He got famous when Clinton was seen with one of his books and he has the same type of political correctness, which like the factual errors isn't accurate either. Maybe he's just too successful for me."
4,A classic Connelly good read,"A great, fast paced detective story with my favourite detective in action. There are lots of twists and turns and a serious underbelly to this gripping tale."
4,"Can't go wrong with a Michael Connelly, but this wasn't quite up to his normal quality.","Yeah, I'm hooked. I don't need to say anything more. However, it's requiring it. It just didn't zing for me."
1,Mahjongg fo Palm OS,I was not able to use the product since it does not support Window 7 which I just installed. I no longer use the Palm Pilot Tungsten 2 since it is not user friendly and will not sync with my PC when I was using Vista operating system. It's old technology and a separate install instructions had to be e-mailed to me for it to work initially.
5,"Reliable, quiet, effective","I bought this fan over a year ago, and it has worked faithfully with no problems. During the summer months it runs almost all of the time. During the day I set the fan speed to high and at night to low. A lever adjusts the thermostat so you don't have to worry about the digital display going out. That happened to my other Holmes fan. I use the Lasko fan for my bedroom window, and it seems less clunky looking than some of the other ones. It stands vertically in my sliding window. I would buy another one."
5,Love Lather products!,"I have tried many products and ""flavors"" from Lather. I really enjoy all of them. I found this to be an excellent moisturizer with a pleasant scent. It lasted after several hand washings and was very moisturizing. I later bought the matching body wash, which is also quite nice. I find the whole line to be very easy on the skin. I break out so easily, that I have always been limited in what I can use. I love being able to use these products, and Amazon is great place to get them!"
1,Wrong Product Arrived. Customer Service was horrible,"First let me say that if the unit you order is actually the unit you receive, this product may very well be okay.I selected the make, model, and year of my car when ordering. The item that arrived was a window vent but did not come close to fitting.I called customer service and the rep I talked to was the worst. His accent was very hard to understand, asked me to speak up, took at least 20 seconds to answer a simple question, and in the end, asked me to EMAIL my problem to their company and did not even help over the phone! Why have me spend all this time on a phone call when you then ask me to email my question for somebody else to deal with and respond within 24-48 hours. AWFUL!"
5,Astrology at Its Finest!,"This is one of the few albums I have ever heard created with a beautiful flow that captures the poetry and chemistry of each of the 12 zodiac signs in music in relation to each other. It is uplifting and captivating, with gorgeous, lush musical arrangements and a great depth of feeling of the nuances of each of the zodiac signs both through the poetry of the lyrics and the accompanying music. I wholeheartedly recommend this album. It is unique."
1,Too sweet!,This pizza sauce is way too sweet to me! It has three times the sugar of another pizza sauce of used.
2,Cannot get replacement handle,"Dead On customer service is horrible. I emailed about a replacement handle and they got back to me a week later telling me to look at their catalog online for current items. There are no 14"" replacement handles offered,but they couldn't just tell me that. Nice customer service. Last hammer I'll buy from them."
3,fair product,"Ordered rolled fondant (white) for my daughter. Product is just what we expected and received the product fairly quick. The only complain is the shipping & handling is too expensive, almost the same as the cost of the product."
2,AMATEUR COMPUTER GRAPHICS,"This DVD promised to have ""Mind bending animations to mind blowing interpretations of Pink Floyd music.""Instead both the musical score and animations didn't live up to either standard and were very disappointing.I expected cutting edge computer graphics from animator David Rogers but found the animations to be out-dated and amateurish. The Pink Floyd musical interpretations were uninspiring at best and didn't flow with the animations which seemed random and out of sync.Overall, I found this DVD to be quite a letdown."
1,Not What I Expected,If you want to save yourself money just listen to pink floyd using either itunes or windows media player visuliser. gives the same effect! The music 'interpretations' are nothing special either. In all an all round dissapointment!
1,A disgrace,"This book does not help one appreciate the Italian westerns, it actually is harmful. It is replete with errors, especially plot summaries which bear no resemblance whatsoever to the films themselves. Could it be that Weisser never saw many of them (back when this book was written few were available and it's unreasonable to expect the author to have seen all 500+ anyway) and just made up entries so as to have something down for each film? Did he think that nobody would see them anyway and wouldn't know? There is an example of two films combined into one, there are missing major supporting actors, etc., etc. Why give a fake plot summary and then spend so much time outlining the director's efforts in other genres? MacFarland should be ashamed of themselves for keeping this book in print. There are much better books available."
5,Great Compilation,"This book describes most if not all of the Italian Westerns made in that era. It's a great book to go to about certain westerns that were made by the directors like Sergio Leone, Corbucci and Sollima. I have many books of this type and this one stands out as one of my favorites. Thank you Thomas Weisser for producing this book!!"
5,You won't be disapointed at all!!,"I looked at all of the roasters amazon had.I liked this one the best because you get so much for so little (...). The quality is excellent.I cooked a 26lbturkey with stuffing in this roaster with no problems at all.The roaster included a lifting rack that helped me a great deal when carving the bird. The nonstick surface is allsome.All I had to do is discard the fat juices and washed in hot soapy water with a paper towel and it was a good as new. This roaster performedmuch better than I expected for the price.Very heavy duty,handlesmade me feel confident from the oven to the counter for carving.Did not feel like the pan would fall apart or brake."
1,Boring,I definitely agree with the previous reviews of this book. I could not get beyond chapter one. This book was blissfully boring!
5,A Fresh Sound,"This EP is very tight, every track is great, just like any classic EP should be and this will be someday. Santi's voice and lyrics are rock star material and the band is tight."
5,Perfect book for a last minute review,"This book helped me finish a month long study/review for my 70-293 exam. Is it ""the"" one and only perfect book - no; no final cram book (you name the publishing comapny) ever is; but it is exactly what it is supposed to be - a final review before the exam. I found it rounded out areas from other study sources that I used and helped complement areas that I already had some knowledge in. I would recommend this as a final / additional review source for anyone studying for the 70-293 exam"
4,Amazing voices!,"This is one of my oldest CDs, but I still play it a lot. I'm not sure if they do the vocals together or if only one of them does the singing, but the voice(s) is(are) amazing! Such strength!The music is kind of country but not in the traditional sense of the word. ""Jezebel Kane"" probably comes closest to the traditional stuff, and that's the song that originally attracted my attention.I wish there were more of this around..."
2,One size does not fit all,"I purchased this to fit a large neck bottle of wine. I suppose it would fit your average wine bottle, but not the large quantity bottles of wine."
4,Well worth the purchase.,"I purchased this in hopes that I wouldn't have to continually wipe the wine drop sliding down the bottle and prevent wine stains on my white counter top...it works great! For the price, you can't beat this gadget. There are alternatives however. I have seen the round discs that you can curl and insert halfway into the top of the bottle, which creates a thinner edge, preventing the ""run down"" effect."
5,EQUUS the best comunication with horses !!!,"A great tool for anyone who want training horses without a professional trainer. This book is a valuable tool of knowledge to any new rider. The descriptions of EQUUS, Robert Monty training methods is easy to understand. I think it would be useful book for anyone interested in making not breaking young horses. Great Book!!!, Great Tool !!!.EQUUS la mejor comunication con los caballos!!!.Una gran herramienta para cualquier persona que quiere entrenar caballos sin un ""Arrendador Profesional"". Este libro es una herramienta valiosa de conocimiento para cualquier nuevo jinete. Las descripciones de EQUUS, métodos de entrenamiento de Robert Monty son fáciles de entender. Creo que sería un libro útil para cualquier persona interesada en la doma y no en quebrar a los caballos jovenes. Gran Libro!!!, ¡Gran Herramienta!!!."
3,FROM MY HANDS TO YOURS: LESSONS FROM A LIFETIME OF TRAINING CHAMPIONSHIP HORSES...,I liked the book but I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't MORE details on the horse language. I plan to reread so I may feel different later. I would like to see more about older horses instead of younger horses starting from scratch.
5,wonderful!!!!,This is a wonderful book! I finally received it and I think is the best book of horses I've ever read!
5,One of my favorite!,"This is a great book, published in France for international students. I studied in France and this book was one of the must! It gives great grammar exercises that will help you to become more ""automatic"" in making your own grammatically correct sentences in French. Great for intermediate students."
2,"Why, Martha, Why?","Martha Grimes is one of the most talented writers of our time. Her only weakness, in my opinion, is her blatant homophobia. Of course, most readers will think one of her returning characters, Marshall Trueblood, is gay, but those who have read the first in the series, ""Man With a Load of Mischief"", will know that he is actually only a flamboyant heterosexual. In ""The Old Contemptables"", I found some of the most hateful writing I have ever experienced. Even the title, ""The Old Contemptables"" refers to her feelings about gays and lesbians. Come on, Martha! You're a good writer. Keep your hate to yourself!"
4,Great Shoe,"Better than I had anticipated; although the size does run small, should have bought a large for a shoe size 7 vs a medium. Very comfortable and easy to put on.I would recommend this for any type of post op injury."
2,Doesn't have a good method for fastening the shoe to the foot,"This shoe would not stay on, even though it was the correct size. The problem is the velcro ties don't loop back like they do in some shoes, so there really isn't any way to tighten it adequately, and it just falls off. I'm returning it."
3,Does the job.,"Awkward and not super comfortable, but does the job. Keeps the tips of toes clear which is good if that is where the problem was."
5,Harder support,"This shoe as expected gave the harder support that I needed to help me recover from the hair line crack in the ankle. Only draw back is that you end up in different level in heights, and I had to find higher sole shoe to help me walk evenly. The harder sole helps a great deal and one doesn't feel the pressure while walking."
1,not a happy shopper,I purchased this product thinking they were sold as a pair.I was very dissapointed when only one shoe came the add was misleading.The product is very good the add was lacking
3,Classy Folk Group,"There are some who would not consider The New Christy Minstrels a Folk group in the true sense of Folk music. They did a lot of the standard folk songs of the day such as ""Blowin' In The Wind"" and "" This Land is Your Land"", but they did a lot of original songs also. ""Green,Green"" was probably their most popular song to hit the charts and ""Today"" is certainly close behind. This collection is probably not my favorite by this group, but it does give a good representation of the span reached by this group. They went from the their own unique folk sound to a more pop sound (Ray Conniff, Johnny Mann) during the ninteen sixties. ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"", ""Wimoweh"" and ""Silly Ol'Summertime"" certainly reflect the change over of the group from songs like ""Saturday Night"" and ""Ramblin"" that reflected their lighter folksy sound. I gave this 3 stars for the musical content...The New Christy Minstrals, under the direction of Randy Sparks, was, and still is, definitely a 5 star group."
5,Nice Chain,"Excellent product made well, it's very smooth and does not snag on fine material. Perfect size it easly fits the small opening on the pendent.Great price for a ""14K White Gold Necklace."""
3,Good but not great,"Unlike some of the other readers, I cheated and checked this book out of the public library first (living in Salt Lake City, libraries are full of books about Utah).The directions, mileage indicators, degree of difficulty and highlights are really excellent. We used this book extensively during our last trip to So. Utah and we able to find each trail of interest without any problem.Unfortunately, the maps for each trail are adequate at best. Instead the book refers you to available published maps of a specific area. Also, all the photos are in black and white which is really a disappointment when you consider the red-rock beauty of So. Utah.But, for the price and size of the book, you won't be disappointed."
4,had fun with this one,"I picked it up in Moab on a recent winter trip (good time to go). We really, really liked the roads it took us on. Bring your bike! Now that I've seen the place, the pictures should be in color, though. I recommend it."
5,"Try man behind the war 1 , 2 , 3 and remake in 1997","Heyif u like this tape, try watching man behind the war 1,2,3 and reamake in 1994 or ( laboratory of evil in US version ) it shows what these people really do in japan death camp and trust me they REALLY use real animals and REAL children corps and real hman being when they perform the vivisected. This is a great film for the REAL untold story of the squadron 731 in the war time. It shows how one group of people can torture so much with out having any humanity in their heart. Watch it , it's base on true story and better yet! Watch all three of them including the remake in 1997 so that makes it all 4. It's all avalible right here on amazon.comIt's worth it!!"
3,If I could give 3 and 1/2 I would.,The first part of the book satisfaction is not guaranteed is excellent its Quark and his family acting the way Quark and his family should act. It also includes appearances by most of the secondary members of Ferenginar society we have come to love over the years and it does not disappoint. Every Deep Space Nice fan should get the book for this story.I did not like Olympus Descending half as much as I liked the first story. While there is some interesting interaction between Odo and Weyoun much of the rest of the story tends to be incredibly philosophical and it is just not my cup of tea sorry.
4,What a nice knife!,"You hold Global knives different than European knives--like you would hold a Chinese cleaver. If you do a lot of Asian cooking, you probably hold knives this way, but it is different than your typical European knives. That said, I just wish Amazon carried the rest of the large collection of Global knives. I love my 4"" paring knife. It is a little smaller to fit in small hands, but it fits in my larger hands nicely as well. It has a very sharp edge that stays sharper longer than my Henckels knives. It is super easy to sharpen with a good diamond steel (much easier than European knives). I would give it 5 stars except the look is a little funky, and they are priced on the high side as well as hard to find. I hope to replace my Four Stars with these over time."
4,Amazon ate my last review,"I would consider myself a Global fan, but something about the handle design on this one just doesn't feel quite right in my hand. Still, it takes and holds an edge as well as all its bigger cousins, and the straight edge makes sharpening an absolute breeze."
2,Ehhh...I found better...,This item will not hook to my ferrets cage. The bars on my cage are vertical. Maybe I can resell it or use it on a different cage.
3,"Great holder, but don't expect it to last","The title of my review says it all. The Hohner harmonica holder was the first one I ever purchased, and it performed fantastically. Due to the wide angle of the neck brace and the plastic tube covering it, I never had a single problem with the holder moving and sliding around my neck. My only complaint is that, after a few months of heavy use, the two small pivots that was moved into place to keep the harmonica from falling out began to loosen. A month later, and they were entirely useless, leaving the harmonica free to fall out. This was so bad that I opted to by a new holder (the one by Lee Oskar, which also has issues -- in particular, it slides around my neck way too much). Still, I'd have to recommend the Lee Oskar holder for those starting out. If Hohner changes the hinge design on this, it'll be hands-down the best harmonica holder out there."
1,Buy the Lee Oskar,"Buy this if you want to develop scoliosis. There is no way to adjust it to make it comfortable to play unless you have no neck. Lee Oskar makes a great holder for 10 holes that is easy to adjust into a comfortable position. You may have to bend it a bit (everyone's frame is different so don't let that put you off) but at least that's possible with the Lee Oskar whereas it's not at all with the Hohner, which is too thick to bend. That thickness also means that it weighs far too much, making it even more uncomfortable."
2,"Uncomfortable for a tall boy, too long for a ten-hole","I got this harp rack a couple of months ago, and I'm pretty unsatisfied. I stand about six feet tall and I've a long neck, and I have to bend my head way down in order to reach the harmonica. It's made to fit all kinds of harmonicas, but the ten hole just kind of sits in the middle. I have a tendency to slide off the end of the harp when using this holder. Add to this a bunch of heavy metal that leaves imprints on your chests and you've got a harp rack that just isn't worth the trouble.Pros: fits any old harp you could imagineCons: Too long for a ten-hole, too short for Average Joe, and too heavy when sitting on the chest."
1,Hohner harmonica neck holder doesn't hold the harmonica,I bought two of thes holders--both of them did not hold the ten hole harmonica for even a second. I thought maybe the first one was defective--but guess they all are at least for the smaller harmonics.
2,Uncomfortable,This is my first harmonica holder purchase and the first one I've actually used so I don't have much to compare it to. It seems to be well built but the ergonomics aren't quite right. I have a pretty average body type and I just can't get it into position where I can play comfortably. It's getting a lot less use than I expected. I would recommend looking for alternatives.
5,Gift for my girlfriend; she loved it!,"I bought this as part of my gift for my girlfriend; and she loved it. Its extremely soft, well made, and ""adorable""-(her words not mine). Plus, its a great value and the perfect size; not too big, not too small.Recommended as a gift for someone special ."
3,Tends to pop loose,"The splitter works fine and powers two devices when it's plugged in. The problem is that it's got a tendency to pop out maybe 1/8 inch at the slightest touch, which is enough to sever the connection. I'd rather have one of the splitters that plugs in and has two cables that come off, each with a connector at the end, as I think that would be less prone to coming loose."
2,Could be dangerous,"It only worked well for a couple weeks. Then, one day during a normal trip to work, it got really hot and started smoking while a GPS and cell phone charger were plugged in at the same time. I don't know if it was because the car couldn't handle it a glitch in the splitter itself, but it was quickly taken out and never used again."
2,Sketchy solution,"I bought this product wo that I could have both my iPhone and my gps navigator pigged in simultaneously. Unfortunately, the electrical connection is unreliable. When you plug it in the red light comes on indicating that there is power to the device. But if I plug ny two devices into it, within a few miles of driving I will notice that the Ted light has gone out. If I wiggle it around, the lit will come back on but it will not stay that way for more than a few seconds. You get what you pay for, I am afraid, when it comes to electronics."
3,AUDIO CABLE TOO SHORT,"RGB PLUG ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY LAPTOP,AUDIO ON THE RIGHT,SO I GATTA GEAUX AN BUY AN EXTENSION."
5,Why are there not more bands like this??,"Remember when you used to be able to head down to the bar/club/joint/etc to see some band you'd only read about (on some cruddy flyer stuck to a phone pole), and had never listened to or heard of before, and they would ROCK YOUR 'NADS OFF?? Huh? remember?? If you were alive in the late 70's, and remember when the B52's played the mudd club in front of a sold out crowd of about 38 people or Debbie Harry & Co. were slaughtering the crowd at Max's, then you remember... and you now should refresh - pick up this rockem sockem disc and relive!!"
1,NOT ONE GOOD SONG,"I bought this CD with high hopes after reading much good about this band however what i put in my stereo was average at best. The songs are the main problem there are none, what this band is trying to accomplish is beyond me. Good punk rock always took chances this band takes none all they do is take the safe generic punk rock approach ala your typical 15 year olds who just got guitars for Christmas. The one positive thing i can say is the womens voice is average in a Nina Gordon(Veruca Salt) kind of way. I give it 1 star. Pass on this CD and if you are the mood for 90s punk rock purchase Swingin Utters or L.E.S. Stiches."
4,Great Beethoven 4th and Fine 5th Concerto from Zacharias,"What a wonderful surprise! Christian Zacharias' brilliant performance of Beethoven's 4th Piano Concerto is among the best I've heard in a long time. His performance of the great 5th ""Emperor"" Concerto is fine too, though not nearly as memorable as those from the likes of Perahia and Schiff. In both works, Zacharias comes across as a younger version of Wilhelm Kempff, especially in his phrasing, which tends to be more lyrical than overly dramatic. He is well served by Hans Vonk conducting the Dresden Staatskapelle in excellent performances of Beethoven's orchestral scores. EMI's sound quality is quite superb for a 1980's vintage digital recording. Although this isn't my primary recommendation for either Beethoven piano concerto, I certainly won't argue that it is a bargain to acquire. Serious fans of Beethoven's piano concerti won't be disappointed with this recording."
5,Stacked Deck is a must read!,"Larry Mitchell has written a heartfelt and compassionate book that sucessfully debunks the American myth of self-reliance at all costs. If you have ever wondered why we have lost a sense of community, why the rich get richer while others do not, or why we have lost the valuable human connections that make life worth living, you must read his book. Mitchell adeptly shows why we are all vulnerable in some way and why we should care about the less fortunate -- who have had the deck stacked against them by our institutions and our thoughtless devotion to self-reliance. Stacked Deck is a must read. If we pay attention to Mitchell's argument, we might make a more compassionate world."
5,Read this book because you care.,"Some authors, in effort to strengthen their own message, try and impress the reader with intellectual jargon. Instead, it puts many readers to sleep (and the book back on the shelf). Other authors, in effort to attract a broader audience, dilute their message with simple prose and, unfortunately, simplistic ideas. Mitchell's recipe for success is his ability to toe the line without reducing the impact of his message. This book should be read by every person who is not an Ivy League graduate, a country club member, or a BMW owner--and, more importantly, this book should be read by every person who is."
4,Not an eyesore!,"This riser seat is quite easy to install. Just remove the toilet seat you are currently using, place the riser on the bowl and place your exhisiting seat on top, insert the long screws and washers provided and that is it! If you have mobility issues, I would recomend having someone who can bend down with ease tighten up the screws/washers.The riser comes in the elongated or standard oval style. So know what type of bowl you have prior to ordering.It raises the toilet about 3-4 inches. The handles on the side are appropiately placed for an assistance in getting up and sitting down.One of the nicest qualities about this riser is that it is not an eyesore! It doesn't scream out ""handicap toilet.""I would have given this product 5 stars, but the seat does loosen up with use and the screws just need to be tightened."
2,Not happy with this,"The entire unit is a single molded piece, so nothing is adjustable. It has no hinges so cannot be lifted for cleaning. It's not wide enough for a somewhat overweight person. The side handles are too small, too low, and located too far back, and are awkward and uncomfortable for a 5'2"" senior with shoulder problems to use comfortably for standing up. I tried to return it, but was told there is no return or refund policy, Also, the seat had no bolts or instructions included. To their credit, the vendor promptly sent these to me and coached me over the phone re how to install the seat. It was a mistake for me to order this, and I'll probably never use it."
1,Great looks -- terrible smell!,"I was thrilled with how this product looked, and ignored the negative reviews. When used, however, urine can get between the product and the top of the toilet bowl and there's no way to clean that without removing it. And so it stinks.Might be OK on an elongated seat, or if the user isn't male. It just doesn't work for men on an standard (non-elongated) toilet."
4,Back Down Memory Lane,The music will be begging for more. THis is a really nice recording and the song selections will bring back the memories!
2,too tiny.,"It's too small to be useful for anything; You can only sucessfully register two notes. I bought this in the hope of being able to have a smaller harmonica to mess around with and see what sort of sound a hohner would before I put money towards a bigger one. It gives off a really nice true-to-tone sound and it registers really clear and it looks cute if you want to use it for aesthetic value as of ""oh, hey, look at me! I have a tiny harmonica!"" and nothing more than that."
3,Barely playable but a nice key fob,"I bought this little harp a few years ago when I started to learn to play the harmonica. I wanted this more as a reminder to practice and it has worked. I have it attached to my key chain and whenever I start my car or open my door I see it hanging there and I think about practicing with my Hohner Golden Melody.As far as playing this harp, it's okay. I can play simple tunes, like Edelweiss. It doesn't sound great but it's a fun way to pass time when I am waiting for something. The only drawback is that it doesn't hold up as well as I would like. I have purchased a few of them as they wear out from hanging on my key chain. All in all, a fun little item."
1,A Nice Christmas Tree Ornament?,"Yes, it's a tiny harmonica and yes, it's somewhat ""cute."" However, to be quite honest, this thing is utterly unplayable. I don't mean to sound angry; I mean that if you wanted to play the harmonica on the Hohner 38C Mini Harmonica, I really don't know if you could. The reeds are out of tune and when you blow into all the holes, the sound that comes out of it does not even remotely resemble what you would expect to come out of the first four holes of a ""real"" harmonica.I only bought this because I was buying a different harmonica and had the option to also purchase this one. I'm not going to rant about how this is a waste of money, because it's less than $2, but I don't suggest buying this ""harmonica"" if you have intentions of playing it. You could use it as a nice key chain or Christmas Tree ornament, but beyond that, its functionality is severely limited."
3,Misunderstood the ad - really too small,Looking over the ad again - it was our fault we ordered this - it really was much too small to use as an instrument. It does fit on a keyring - we re-gifted it to a young relative who was happy with it.
1,cheap,I was hoping for a harmonica that was small but played well; this one does not. I won't try to buy a mini-harmonica cheaply again.
3,Mini harmonica,The mini harmonica is rather cheaply built but for the price their okay these small harmonicas are more for a fun little key chain collection
2,Bung a shrimp on the barbie,"I have never not finished a book, but I was tempted to give this one away. Every second paragraph had a Australian name drop. Every page, there was a deviation that included, shopping item (explained for the non-Australian), street directions. I felt that the author was given a challange to include every Australian invention, every Australian sporting event, all the Australian owned food and cleaning products and any other invention, in her book. There was definately a cringe factor in this book. I would not recommend this to any one. It is not even worthy as a book to read on the train. I was given it as a present because I was a cat lover. I would not have bought this."
3,Eagle-ish harmonies,"PALOMINO ROADThe 90s US country group Palomino Road consists of four musicians who have lived in Nashville for some years. The main songwriter, Ronnie Guilbeau (Lead Vocals, Guitars), is the brother of Gib Guilbeau of the Burrito Brothers, and he worked with his father's band until moving to Nashville in the mid 80s. His best known song is ""Call It Love"" recorded by Poco. J.T. Corenflos (Guitars, Vocals) came to Nashville in 1982, and worked on the Grand Ole Opry and as a member of Joe Stampley's band. Randy Frazier (Bass, Vocals) played for Sammy Kershaw, while James Lewis (Drums, Vocals), originally from Kansas City, has been playing in Nashville since 1970. Palomino Road was formed in 1992 and unlike many bands, they are a self-contained unit with no outside musicians or session singers involved. They made the US country charts with a spirited revival of George Jones' ""Why Baby Why""."
5,One of the funniest shows ever!,"I bought this dvd for one particular episode titled, ""Atomic Shakespeare"" but as I went through them, it just reminded me of how funny this show was! All the terrific banter back and forth made this purchase worth it. I plan on having the whole series soon. :)"
4,problem with DVD menu,"there is a problem with DVD menu (Disk 2/3)play by episode screen allows you access only to 2episodeshowever you can watch all episodes on the disk via Play All optionotherwise it's absolutely delightful show, I like it very much"
5,A Legend!,"A ground-breaking, inspiring, still up-to-date, fresh, witty and outstanding TV-show!Great writing, brilliant dialoges and a wonderfully creative cinematography!Two great actors with a sexual chemistry that is legendary!Cybill Shepherd in the part of her life!Bruce Willis better than he's ever been!That's ""Moonlighting"".DON'T MISS IT!"
3,GREAT SERIES HORRIBLE SEASON,"I LOVE THIS SHOW. I HAVE SEASON 1&2 ON DVD, COULDNT WAIT TO GET SEASON 3. SEASON 3 SUCKED...THE 1ST DISK IS THE BEST DISK 2-4 ARE NOT OF THE ORIGINAL SHOW FORMAT. THEY GO BACK IN TIME, THEN THEY WASTE TIME ON A BUNCH OF THE EPISODES WITH GUEST TALKING ABOUT CRAZY STUFF AND THEY WERE ON A TV SHOW AND DOCUMENTARY....THERE HARDLY ANY DETECTIVE WORK.Moonlighting - Season 3"
2,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap!","There were two shows from the early/mid 1980's that I wanted on DVD. Remington Steele brought a fine blend of mystery and comedy to TV. The other show was Moonlighting also a fine blend of mystery and comedy.The major problem with Moonlighting is the Lion's Gate Entertainment release. Cheap packaging and little thought to menu selection made the season 1&2 release barely worth the cost. Only the excellent pilot and follow-on shows made it worth the purchase.Now we have the season 3 release with the same problems. Topping off the cheapness of the packaging, I had forgotten that season 3 was full of short story lines that required ""fillers"" and story lines that didn't even try to include the mystery aspect. It's no wonder that I didn't bother watching the follow-on seasons and won't be buying the DVDs for seasons 4 and 5.Unless you like iambic pentameter and a few poorly plotted mysteries save your money for season 3 of Remington Steele."
4,Moonlighting,"The show is a little dated now, but it does include Atomic Shakespeare,which is still great to watch."
3,Moonlighting Season 3,"Compared to programming of today, this is still an outstanding program. Problem is that by season 3, the writers seem to have lost direction; now spending too much time on building up a romance between David and Maddie. The banter between these two in the first seasons are what made the show so much fun."
3,anti-climactic,"not that it's poorly written, it's just that there is nothing new about Buk here and other tomes by Howard Sounes and Daniel Weizman make for more interesting reading. It seems Aubrey Malone read all of Buk's books and decided to write about the great writer...no crime there, to be sure, but it does not make for interesting reading at all. A.D. Wynans (a former postal worker himself, as Buk was) actually knew Bukowski & I wonder if his take on the mad boozer of East Hollywood might have more punch."
5,Flex-a-lite 3915 Transmission Oil Cooler Installation Kit,Flex-a-lite 3915 Transmission Oil Cooler Installation KitExcellent find here on this reinstall kit. Sold one truck and removed before selling. Now ready to reinstall on a different radiator.A must have to do this job right and a even better price.Buy with confidence.RagenRat
4,Caveat emptor......,"The product is nicely done and thorough, we bought it for our church. My comment is regarding the price. It was our responsibility to double check this, but we ""assumed"" that for $176 we would be getting a set containing multiple DVDs. That was incorrect, instead we got a single DVD. We later discovered that this item is commonly available for $29.99 plus shipping at several other websites."
5,Great little Inspirational Booklet,"This booklet was originally a supplement to The Oprah Magazine.A hundred pages of many small inspirational writings that deal with happiness, romance, weight, success, overcoming fear, overcoming failure, etc etc.Many of these writings have a spiritul basis and are straight to the point and some of the points made are profound.A great little read and something you can come back too when you need a little friendly advice.A few of the writings are aimed at women, but even these are valuable to guys as well. Certainly NOT a chick book, it's for everyone and anyone who is still alive and looking to get more out of their life."
3,"Sexist, NOT sexy","I bought this book after reading Robbins' 79 Park Avenue, which I highly recommend. This book didn't really do it for me. The best parts of the story are the real-life Vegas mafia history and the explanations of different ways people scam and cheat the casinos. The ""love"" stories and everything else that didn't involve money, gambling, intrigue, or international crime were just lame and felt tacked-on. The main thing I didn't like was the casual attitude toward rape that made the novel feel extremely mysoginistic despite some sympathetic female characters. Still I must admit, this is a suspenseful read that has a lot of fascinating twists to keep you clicking your Next Page button."
1,Too expensive,Paying $1.67 for each beam is too expensive.It is just a plastic piece. Its not even strong. 6 out of 12 curve beam is broken/useless now.It should be 12 dollars for a 12 beam. A dollar for a beam is ideal. But this is rip off for this quantity and reliability.
5,Fantastic view,"What a terrific book. Arthur Grace takes you inside America via a stroll along the great midways of the country fair. What better way to find the real America. The use of B&W allows the viewer to delve into the contents of the photo, rather than being seduced by the color. Highly recommended."
5,A classic slice of Americana,These photographs are extraordinary capturing a vivid part of American life that many urban Americans no longer see. Some of its funny. Some of its poignant. Some of its immensely sad. Only in America. Kudos to a great photographer.
5,Absolutely The Best Knives For Pro or Home,"I was a commited fan of Henkels, Trident, and Sabatier until Global knives were recomended by a professional I trust. I'd been battling carpal tunnel syndrome and many of my knives were just too heavy and unbalanced for steady use. I began with two of the vegetable cleavers/knives and continued to buy more. They are as sharp as razors and hold an edge beautifully. The edge is very different from that of European cutlery, so you must learn a different sharpening technique, but that comes quickly. If you are thinking of buying premium knives, be sure you try Global."
2,In a word.....Boring!,"Bought the disc based on the recommendations here. Now, I am aware that most people who are fans of a particular artist are NOT the best people to objectively review the artist. Having purchased a couple of String Cheese Incident discs based on reviews here, and not being disappointed, I took a chance. Now, Williams has talent, but the songs are just not interesting enough. Pleasant, but so are alot of albums. I want and demand more. This ain't it, folks. Beware."
3,HOW SHE DONE HIM IN AND OTHER CRIME STORIES BY WOMEN AUTHORS,"I bought this book at a second hand book store which actually had a fine selection of women's literature/mystery books. This book is an anthology of some short stories written by women but I didn't get it for ONLY that reason: I purchased the book because of its descriptive catalogue of over 100 women dectectives from 1861-1974 (this book was pub in 1975 so later excellent authors are not listed-which is the only drawback). However the short stories of many early women writers are featured here: Baroness Orczy Emmuska, Anna Katherine Green, Gladys Mitchell, and concluding with the women Detective chronoligical survey. This is a RARE copy and may be difficult to locate. I would give it a higher star rating except that many of the stories are not by women authors. Still, Michele B Slung included a number of rarely published women authors of detective fiction, a rare genre in itself.Was this helpful to you?"
4,This is TOO good,"I've been on the lookout for a good strong wall magnet for months, and nothing out there seems to pass muster. Finally, just when I thought I would be using old-fashioned knife block technology forever, these folk come to the rescue. Or so I thought. The magnet is SO strong that it attracts virtually all metal within a 6 foot radius. I've had to replace 3 watches so far, and almost sliced my wife to ribbons when my Chinese chopper slipped from my grasp as I was retrieving it from the dishwasher and hurtled across the room. Great product guys, but you need to make the magneticability adjustable."
5,victorinox swiss army watch,"I chose this watch as a gift for my eldest son's college graduation. He is a watch collector and has some lovely pieces, but had expressed interest in this one for a more casual look. I researched it and all reviews were quite positive. I need to add to the trend, this watch is handsome, I am told it is quite comfortable, it is so easy to read with its clear face and the crystal has prevented damage to the face with my son's hobbies. This is a great item!"
1,Avoid Mr. Watch,"The seller, Mr. Watch, sent me a broken watch and then stiffed me on the return because of a technicality on their return policy. Don't buy from Mr. Watch, unless you want a shiny, $200 paper-weight."
1,"First one defective, second one also defective","December, 15,2011; Got this watch as a gift. The first one died after 3 weeks. The jeweler gave me a new one after it was evident that Swiss Army was taking months to repair it. The new one is also failing. It just stops for no reason; battery checks ok.Quartz watches in general are way over priced. The best movement only costs about $20.00. You are paying for the case and the huge mark up.Anyway, no more Swiss Army watches for me.June 23, 2012 (6 months later) This watch continues to be a piece of garbage. The date indicator advances randomly. I would send it back to Swiss army, but the are absolutely awful for customer service and I simply don't want to aggravate myself dealing with these people. This one is going in the trash."
2,Barron's is better,"This book was good as a general review, but now I'm working through Barron's GRE book and I'm happy that I didn't rely on the Princeton Review book. Barron's GRE is much more rigorous. All areas of the GRE are covered much more thoroughly by Barron's GRE."
5,GREAT test prep,"Bought this book along with ETS' 10 practice tests and studied all summer. This book offered a schedule so I knew what to study when according to how much time I had before the test. The accompanying online access was very helpful. Taking practice tests on the computer as it was for real helped a lot. The instructions about the different types of questions, several practice tests, thorough score reports and explanations of the answers make this one of the best test prep books I""ve ever used. I got a 700verbal 710analytical.You won't need Kaplan."
5,My math score went from 430 to 610.,Great book. My math score went from 430 to 610 just from using this book.
2,Contains errors,"I took this book out of the library because I'm not very good at math... and yet I've found several errors in the math so far. Among others, a triangle's angles measure 90, 43 and ""a"" degrees respectively, and we are told that a=43.The answer explanation of one question states that 1/105=1/7.I have no idea how many errors of this type there may be because math isn't my strong suit.There's a glitch on the CD in recording the practice test scores; it told me I got 730 on the verbal and it recorded the score on its chart as 710.Also, the book tells us that we will have 45 minutes for the math section, and then later tells us we'll have 30 minutes. I think the latter time is correct."
3,"Verbal good, Math bad","The verbal section gave very good tips. The quantitative section, I felt, was a mess. (And I've been an editor for 15 years -- so I know a mess when I see it!) The author would spend ridiculous amounts of space explaining a concept as simple as a ""digit,"" yet skip over the reason for using a certain formula to solve a more complex problem. Moreover, the author recommends ""plugging in"" answers for many problems that are actually easier to DO.Very disappointed. After reading book, I took their first online practice test, and got 770 verbal, 490 quantitative. Granted, I already knew that I need to go back and memorize geometry formulas, which I haven't done yet. But then I'll need to practice using them--and this book doesn't provide for that practice. I'll be buying another book for that--from a different publisher."
4,Best Book - but supplement with other software,"I used several GRE prep books, and this was by far the most useful. It seems written for a more intelligent audience - those aiming for 700+ on the Quantitative and Verbal sections. The ""Hit Parade"" section gave clear definitions as they are given on the GRE. I also reviewed the book's Analytical Writing section the night before the exam and it greatly helped organize my thoughts.The only way to improve this would be to add a CD-ROM with practice test software. The Princeton Review's online exam was difficult to access and required registration, and the book didn't give access to any more than the basic online test (which is already free to anyone). Use this book in combination with other testing software for better results.Also, don't buy separate vocabulary flash cards unless you are in a real hurry. It was much more efficient for me to make my own flash cards with index cards, based only on the words that were new to me."
4,Good Resource,"This was my only resource for taking the GRE, and I only studied two weeks in advance, and I scored in the top 85%, so it must be a good teacher. This book is good at breaking things down so that you know how to take the test and select the best answer. Good review of all the sections, and two full length practice exams. I would recommend."
3,"Does A Good Job, But Could Do Better","This book was helpful, it was written well and in a positive style (which is good if you're freaking out about the GRE). When I bought this book I also ordered a couple of other GRE test prep books, and compared to some of the others (like the Barron's book for example) the Princeton Review book did not have as much practice sets and their word list was not as comprehensive either. This books was great in a lot of ways, but i just wish it had more."
3,Could find a better book,"This book is helpful for those who need additional instruction understanding the basics of math. It focuses on building skills from the beginngin (starting with what is an interger, etc). I found it to be a bit disorganized in the math section, and I think the Kaplan book (which I also used to study) is much more helpful in the verbal section. Note also that the Princeton book provides a DVD companion- it is not a supplemental CD with exam questions. The Kaplan book was much more organized, strategy-focused, and understandable. It also had more practice questions."
3,not sure what sets this apart,"I bought this because I saw it at my physical therapist's office. I am not sure what I expected, but it is not much different than Eucerin Cream."
3,Received the wrong scent,"I ordered the scented version of this product for my son's physical therapist to use when massaging his limps. I was disappointed to open the package and realize I had been sent the unscented product. The invoice included with the order states SCENTED. If it works well I guess it won't matter, but why offer a choice if you can't get the one you want."
3,Massage,"For people on guai, this is a good option for massage lotion. It is kind of greasy and has a bit of a smell to it. But, it works when there aren't many options!"
5,Excellent massage cream; Used by the pros...,"My wife's physical therapist has used this cream as part of her muscle-related treatments for several weeks now [pain from the hip to the feet]. It maximizes the effectiveness of massaging and manipulating muscles/tendons and other body tissues. The cream is not greasy or oily on the skin, and a little goes a long way. If you can find Free-Up in a department store, it will be pricey...this is the best value, especially with free shipping."
4,FreeUp Massage Cream,This large jar white cream goes on smoothly and is relatively non greasy. It has been very beneficial in helping to free up scar tissue after a recent knee replacement. Works well and is inexpensive.
4,Smooths skin,"I use Free-Up to massage the area around my rotator cuff on both shoulders. It makes the skin very pliable. Seems to work deep into the muscle so that the pressure I apply does not hurt. No greasy skin after use. A little bit goes a long way. Would like to know what medicial properties the product has, if any. Initially it was used by my physical therapist.Good enough for him, good enough for me."
1,Too stinky!!,"I didn't get a chance to see if the actual cream was any good because as soon as I opened it up I could smell the ""unscented"" stink of it. It smelled like some nasty antiseptic from a hospital. This does not spell relaxation to me. I think Free-Up should invest in some fragances."
5,A little goes a long way,I noticed that this was the same cream that was used by my Physical Therapist. It works really well. Not as slippery as an oil and is absorbed by the skin quickly. Be careful not to use too much at once though!
3,A frothy YA book with serious points...,"Christmas time can be depressing, to many. Being forced to spend it where you don't want to be makes it even worse, as Jo discovers when she is forced to spend her winter break with her dad and his girlfriend in snowy Colorado. She is a California girl who wants to surf, not ski. However, when she lays eyes on Hans, Jo decides that Let it Snow might be a good theme song. Even when she learns Hans is really Frew, he still looks good. Unfortunately, Dad can't stand him, whether he's Hans or Frew or whoever. He's pushing a true jerk, Justin, at her. He can't even call Jo by her name, but insists on calling her Josephine.*** On the surface, this is a frothy young adult romance, but there are serious points to be made about young love, the changing family make up, and judging others. Many young people are finding themselves having to deal wtih things like Jo faces, maybe this will help. ***Reviewed by Amanda"
5,Hilarious!,"Jo Vincent is not a happy kid. Her dad is taking her to Colorado for a ski trip so she can ""spend some quality time"" with him and Kate, his new girlfriend. Her mom makes her go, claiming it'll be a good experience, but Jo isn't so sure.Her first day on the slopes, after a freak accident, she meets Hans. According to Jo he's going to be the envy of all her friends back home, because he's a ""god."" Jo and Hans get on really well, they go for countless hot chocolates, and talk about everything. But on time, when Jo makes a mistake on the slopes, she learns something about Hans. Hans isn't really from Scandanavia, and his real name is, in fact Frewin. He's from Austrailia, and trying to get a sponser for a pro ski turnament. Jo's a bit miffed at Frewin, but she still likes him the same.The end of the book takes a different turn, it almost turns into a mystery. I highly recommend this book, because it's hilarious and light at the same time."
5,Loved it,"This movie made a lot of sense to me. I truly believe that you can reset your health by limiting your diet for a fixed period of time. I highly recommend this film for anyone who has been interested in learning about juicing.Joe Cross is certainly a likeable hero in this documentary. He, like many of us, is stuck on the train of gaining weight, not moving enough, and having a poor diet. It's no wonder that the acronym for the Standard American Diet is SAD! He's stuck on medications.He decides to go on a timed juice diet and within 60 days he's lost a lot of weight, his blood work has greatly improved, and he feels amazing.What I like about this documentary and this diet is that it's reasonable. It doesn't ask you to change your life forever - although you probably will. It just says, hey, if you want to feel better and reset your body, here's how to do it. And you can do it as often as you want to.Kudos to Joe and his success."
5,Very inspiring,I really enjoyed the movie. It was very inspiring and made me put regular juice cleanses back into my monthly schedule again!
5,No Excuses,"After witnessing someone go through terminal cancer, I decided to research alternative methods for treating this terrible illness. As soon as I watched this movie, I knew I wanted to be pro-active with my own health & begin a juicing routine. I do believe that we have the ability to heal our own bodies from disease & illness. If people would stop making excuses as to why they can't do something like this, they would realize how simple it really is & the impact it can have on their overall health/life. I am relatively healthy, but look forward to the positive results juicing will bring me. Thanks to Joe Cross for introducing us to this & being an inspiration. For anyone with cancer, I also recommend checking out Gerson therapy."
3,"I didn't want to like it, but I did","I have reviewed a lot of books on natural living, health, etc. over the years - probably in the hundreds. I thought this was an easy one to skip since I've known about juicing for a long time. However, the film has its charm, moves along well, is not pandering to its audience, nor condescending to those unfamiliar with healthy eating. It's well done, the animations explaining some of the more technical aspects of how the body processes nutrients were effective, and it even had a happy ending - something rare in a documentary. Worth a watch on a rainy day."
3,Inspiring but...,"The dedication of the two men is inspiring, but the diet needs more thought. I'm a little more than skeptical the added juice had anything to do with curing the women's headaches."
2,One Long Advertisement,"This wasn't the worst health documentary I have ever seen. That being said, all of the useful information in this film is the same as is contained in every other legitimate health documentary out there. The real issue for me with this film was the fact that it comes across as being one giant Paid Advertisement for the juicer used in the show. The juicer, by the way, is way overpriced; there are plenty of quality juicers on the market which sell for less. Another issue I have is the way this film promotes throwing away such a huge amount of valuable nutrition by dumping all the fiber which is extracted from the juice. The bottom line: don't waste your time with this film."
3,Okay as long as you ignore the crunchy slant,"Chocked full of information, and a few inspirational stories, unfortunately it's all wrapped in vegi bias, as long as you filter out the garbage it's worth the watch."
2,It's a juicer commercial.,The first 20 minutes were pretty good. Then I got the point that this guy lost all this weight by doing a juice flush. After that it's repetitive and gets boring quickly. Sometimes I couldn't tell if this was a movie or a juicer commercial.
5,excellent,What a great role model! Love this documentary. Its very motivating! Good on you Mr. Cross for promoting a healthy lifestyle!
5,Education reading,"This opened my eyes to healthier eating and exercise. I have been working at putting more juicing in my daily routine, but difficult when you havea busy work schedule. But great idea. I wish there were ideas of what veggies you need to juice each day to get the balanced foods you need."
5,"Fat, Sick & Al;most Dead","Great video; very inspiring. It arrived on-time and in pristine condition!Share this with friends that you care about. Also, watch the ""out-takes"" that didn't make it into the movie. They contain more detail regarding specifics of nutrition."
4,Funny yet inspiring,I loved this movie! Very funny but also inspiring. Good way to get motivated to lose weight and start juicing!
3,It was very enlightening but too long.,It did however convince me to start juicing. It's been a week and still going. I think I will start back to real food soon.
4,I am all for getting healthy!,Inspiring. Makes you want to go out and start doing this I just do not think this is going to be easy.
5,A real feel good movie!,Simular diet to the documentary Forks Over Spoons but with the twist and defiant ease of the juicer/smoothie. I have a hard time eating greens but I can get a spinach and kale smoothie down.
3,Interesting concept,"Interesting concept. To bad they make it look so easy. Also this can set your body up for yo-yo dieting. Which in most cases, puts more weight on people in the long run."
1,But...,"This is a great diet plan for someone who does not need to be on a diet. Issue here is what you are removing from your food by juicing it, mainly fiber. Fiber can control blood sugar spikes and curb hunger. Even though you might not think of it, this is a high-sugar, low fat diet. Low fat diets are notorious for making people feel starved, and for good reason. Anyway, this is not a debate on nutrition, but a film review. As a film, I thought it was good, but as far as quality of information, evidence-based research, etc, not so much, hence the low rating. Also, not for the average overweight person with no time on their hands. Worth a watching, but think before commiting."
2,Preachy,"Some guy who decides that he's ready to change his life goes on an extreme diet road trip and tries to convince others to do the same. Good luck keeping it up, bud."
5,do it,Loved this documentary........got me motivated to buy a juicer and to start juicing. Got my kids involved too.Thank you
5,This could save your life!,"Hardly anybody would watch this unless they were desperate to change the course of their health and their life. Medicine has a lot of answers, but not all. I applaud Joe Cross's courage and dedication to get this information out to the mass market. You are what you eat. Want a revelation? Watch this!"
5,Bloody Brilliant Mate!,This movie really took a turn for the greatness when the focus shifted to Phil and his family. It's astounding what willpower and determination can accomplish. I'll be sharing this with the rest of my family.
4,watched it after getting the Juicer,"It motivated me to do more Juicing. Joe Cross was pretty inspirational, as well as the other people in the movie. I'd recommend it to others, if you like documentaries."
4,This is the truth!,"I wish I could *make* many of my fat friends and relatives watch this, but the truth is that until they *want* to, it would be a waste. Still, it is a good documentary that caused us both to applaud in our den as we watched it ... several times."
4,Inspiring,I thought it was a well made movie. There were some parts of the story that fell flat. Maybe more of a narrative on why people still eat the way they do regardless of the risk.I think I am going to try the 5 day fast.
2,Slow and Borring,The point was made about 20 minutes in. The rest is just one person after another getting healthier by doing juice fasts. Extremely slow and boring. I was just waiting for the juice machine infomercial to start...
1,Using emotions to make a sale pitch and sell a juicer :),"Nice try, making us believe you are some kind of good guy helping others, but no cigar Mr. salesman, when we find that you try to sell us your ""recipes"" and other products (check out the end titles)."
1,What a joke,"first of all you can go to youtube.com a watch for free the same movie. I tried this for 30 day and lost nothing.i did not cheat i followed it to a t walked a mile a day nothing came off i did not lose a shirt size or a pant size nothing at all. DON'T waste your money all you do is juice for 30-60 days or the rest of you life.nothing but juice ,"
5,Very inspiring!,"What a wonderful and moving documentary! I have been meaning to start juicing for quite some time now -- I always intend to start ""tomorrow"", but tomorrow never comes. I'm definitely going to take my juicer (which has never been used!) off the shelf and start the program."
3,IF YOU WANNA LOSS WEIGHT...,Great movie to watch to get you motivated in lossing weight/ diet or even just eating more healthy every day.
4,juice!,"got me to buy a juicer, so I guess that's a good result! will recommend this to a friend for sure"
5,Just Fantastic!,I won't say too many words - I think... I've been in and out of juice fasts and mostly-raw diets for years. This film has given me incredible inspiration to get excited again about all of this - and with a sense of lightness and fun! Very cool!
4,Worth the watch - Inspiring,"A little slow at some points and obviously not the only way to affect major change in your health/weight, but this video is inspiring because of it's realness. He seems to be a humble man, not making much to do about his money and willing to step forward and really help people while on his own journey in life. Oh and you have to love that all the narration is in his Australian accent!Video was produced well - very professional style."
5,"Inspirational, Non-Judgmental, Informative","I have to start by saying that Joe Cross is one gutsy guy. To put himself out there in his starting condition, no holes barred, in a place that many of us rest 'comfortably', was the perfect way to begin this journey.I'm not sure if I could really do the juice diet as he did but I know that I have tried to skip some meals and substituted with a fortified juice drink. And it does feel good, fills me up and takes away my hunger for quite awhile.I know this is a pretty poor comparison to changing your whole diet and food intake but it is a small step for me.What I really liked about Joe was when he received a voice mail from an obese truck driver who was ready to make the change and Joe traveled back to the states to help him out.He was inspirational, non-judgmental, encouraging and yet -- told us like it is while using himself as the scapegoat.Well done."
5,Want to change your life? Watch this film,"I have never seen such an inspiring and enjoyable documentary. I watched the entire film several times and loved every minute of it. It was a stroke of genius for Joe Cross to combine his weight loss regimen with an all-American road trip and the result is a slice of Americana that leaves one chomping at the bit to try juicing. But the real star of the show is the truck driver Phil Staples. You don't meet him until halfway through the film, but his portrayal is so heartfelt and moving that people actually stand up and cheer by the time the film is completed."
5,A must see,This is most definitely a must see. I was captivated through the whole dvd. I just went vegan a month ago and will be looking at purchasing a juicer to go on my first fast. Very heartwarming and encouraging.
4,great documentary,"i believe everyone should watch this, it makes you think twice about food, and how it affects our body. recommended it to many friends."
5,Amazing documentary!,"Truly an amazing film! It is so inspiring and motivates you want to live a healthier lifestyle! Highly recommend, a must-see film!!!!"
5,Must See !!,Probably one of the most influential and realistic documentaries I have seen this year. A very good film to see something new and inspiring!
4,Kick the Fat,"Well put together with good humor, smartness, truth and captivating!!It kept my attention. A short story telling the truth about thousandsof fat/heavy people who should take their health more serious. A pathwayto good health."
5,Great documentary!!,Our duet already consists of alot of whole food but have been interested in juicing for a while and cane upon the movie while searching for the perfect juicer. What an inspiring story!!!! Kudos Phil! I actually bought 2 of the DVDs to pass around to friends and family to watch;-)
3,"picture blacked white, and no closed captions!","Picture was black and white, no color, even they show closed captions, but its not working right, something copyright incorrect, I would need to get another one I paid for what I do, it is not fair for me to not see closed captions and color are not normal!, resend me package, I will swamp back to you when I get the right stuff that I ordered!"
2,Anti-American,"Portrays all Americans to be fat, dumb, gun carrying morons. I just bought a juicer and wanted some inspiration....oh well"
3,Not what I expected,It wasnt what I thought it was gonna be. Kinda boring. I will probably give it to my son since he is the one that told me about it.
3,Too long,Think he could have given more info on his juicing coctails. Truck driver inspired me. Wouldn't order again. Too much of the traveling photos and cartoons.
1,Sad,I finally got a chance to watch this DVD and it did not work! TOTALLY bummbed!!! It is an honest mistake I'm sure.
1,nothing more than a commercial for juicer,This movie is completely bogus. The guy starring in it is nothing more than the person who will be making a ton of money from these juice machines. The movie is a set up from the very start and they know it. You want to avoid this thing as they say let the buyer beware. Anyone stopping cortisone will lose weight. This is all BS AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND THIS FILM KNOW IT.
1,Not worth your time,This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. The premise of this film is very contrived. It is just playing the typical cliches. Is there really anyone surprised that one is able to consume tons of fatty food in the southern states? What is interesting about watching a guy juice fast? I am surprised that this movie is so high rated.
5,Eye Opener,This documentary opened my eyes & is motivating me to go through & REBOOT my life. Anyone can do this! I cannot wait to start my Reboot!!!!
5,Inspirational!,I highly recommend this movie! I've been interested in juicing for quite some time. This has given me the push I needed to get me going! I was particularly inspired by Phil! What an amazing transformation he made! Congratulations to him! I'm ready to reboot!
5,Motivated me to buy a juicer,"This film is motivating. It makes you realize that your health is in your hands. So I showed this film to my wife (my second time to watch). We were both moved by it and have now bought a juicer. This film helped us realize that we have got to get going, not just listen, but activate ourselves to better health.My wife and I have a long road ahead of us, but this film was the spark."
2,"extensive statistics, but still unreliable","Extensive statistics on support/resistance and probability of break thoughs are given for a ten year period. The good news is that it is accurate for the commodity that I checked out (lean hogs, they're were called live hogs back then), Unfortunately, the number of occurances is not given in the book. The author suggests taking a position on something that has has happened less than ten times in the last decade. Some occurances at the extreme of his price zones have happenned only once. For instance a 1 and 6 signal will have a 100% chance of doing something. No mention is given that population size is ONE! His theories of zones are interesting, and maybe this book will spur some reader to buiild on this theorey. But not this one......"
4,"Amazing that it still works, but it does-----","DETECTING HIGH PROFIT DAY TRADES IN THE FUTURES MARKET by J.T. JACKSON............we use it for entry when have five or 8day signal,or pivot ......its a simple book,but the lookups are worth it..........it projects probable price action for the day,using back data......amazing that it still works ,but it does"
3,Lot of mumbo,".... this book is filled with lots of white space, blank pages and mostly useless information. It's a very quick read, and has some limited trading appeal. The logic is very similar to market profile and daytraders' pivot numbers. Price seeks to reach a middle ground ""pivot"" - shaped like a bell curve, with the most activity in the middle and least on the extreme ends. This book throws a whole bunch of stats of percentages of what happened when in particular ranges. This is similar to market profile, with a vague theory of generalities, and requires you to work with wide stops within zones. Market profile and floor pivot number traders may find this book useful in linking together a method , but overall .. this book isn't worth buying."
1,Useless,"This is probably the worst, most useless book I've ever read on TA. It is pretty much continuous tables of data which was not at all helpful to me. Extremely little narrative. Sorry."
1,You have to be kidding me!,"Page 35 says, ""circle the correct answer."" Then the question is ""450 + 210"" and the only possible responses are 651 or 251. It doesn't give the correct answer, which is 660. It seems about every 5 pages or so there is another major mistake like the one mentioned. My daughter is a 1st grader working in this book to be challenged. Instead, she is finding errors! It is not very difficult work. Seems much easier than 2nd grade. I've moved her on to the 3rd grade book.What a shame that a book company could release such shoddy work! No wonder American kids lag behind the rest of the world -- they are working in books containing errors and might not even know how many errors are there! (As one posted said they didn't even see the errors)."
5,Who doesn't love this knife?,"I work in a banquet kitchen that produces high class cuisine on a very large scale. When it comes to chef's knives, I work alongside every brand of knife imaginable. I see a lot of Shuns, Henkels, Ken Onions, Globals, and one guy even sports his James Beard limited edition chef's knife. But the funny thing is, when it comes to an alternate knife for more precise cuts where perfection is mandatory, this is the knife in everyone's kit. I always have to be careful where I lay my knife so that no one confuses it as theirs, but it just goes to show you how great of a knife this is. The shape of the knife allows you to line up the food for a perfectly straight cut that is made simple with the thin design and ultra sharp, low maintenance blade. It definitely shouldn't be the first knife for your collection as it's not the best choice for the variety of tasks commonly associated with a chef's knife, but it sure makes a remarkable addition to any set."
5,Best,I have never used a better knife. over 4 years since purchase and still sharp. Wish I could afford an entire set.
1,I think it sucks!,The Design of this knife is HORRIBLE! Not all people are as careful as they want to and we know what we will get (painful cut!). This brand is not taking people's security into consideration. The corner close to the handle is general really sharp and some items even have a curve that is making it worse.I am really unsatisfied that the sharpness of this brand's collection is good enough while you may get a few stitches on your skin easily.
4,Rewarding and excellent value,"This CD is a bargain, a wonderful collection of music at a very reasonable price for the quality.The first movement, Vivace, of Bach's Concerto for Two Violins in D Minor bursts forth at the listener, like a fully present sun rise. Immediately the elegant echo effects begin as the two violins compliment each other, sometimes overlapping to create a tapestry of rich warm textured sound, always energetic and overty apparant. No sooner is the listener accoustomed to the refrain patterns of the two violins, than the patterns change and increase in complexity. In the second movement, the Largo, ma non tanto, the piece becomes a little sweet, a little sentimental but it is complexity that saves it from sentiment. In the third movement, the Allegro, we are treated to a robust and intricate maze of scales, interweaving, ascending, descending, taking us to the fully balanced and refined close.The price is very reasonable for excellent music."
4,Perlman's Bach,These are good-to-excellent performances on a bargain disc. Probably the best single disc set of these concertos at any price.
1,lasts for 5 months,"I purchased this product in May of 2002. In September 2002 it just stopped working. The unit would not heat nor would it brew. It just worked one day and then stopped. The only way to fix it is to send it to Mississippi at my own expense, and be without my coffee maker for who knows how long. Every other brand of coffee maker I've ever had in my life has lasted me for many years of coffee making... not this one. Sleek, yet a complete waste of money."
1,Completely devoid of technical information,"What a suprise! The only use I've found for this book is to prop the leg up on my broken couch. It really doesn't even do that very well! I think that the only people who rated this book well, were those in management who like the idea of learning the meaning of as many dis-jointed acronyms as possible so they can feel knowlegable at the next ""staff meeting."" And by the way, can we cut out the ATM worship?!? Please?!? If you wasted your money on this book, I hope at least it will make a great drink coaster..."
1,Cheap trick,Very hastily compliled mix of three-letter acronyms and more or less direct copies of company whitepapers. This book is definately _not_ worth of your money.
5,Very comprehensive coverage to VoIP technologies,"The book provides a full review of all the main technologies driving the VoIP industry as well as the major players. I was surprised with the two reviews posted here.According to Netguru bookstores, the book was a bestseller at INTEROP last October in Atlanta. It also was piked as the book of the week by computer literacy. I think the trash of some are indeed the treasure of others! I particularly liked the many Powerpoint slides in the book, which provides a graphical overview of the subject being covered.Certainly this is not the ultimate word in VoIP technology, and I don't think it was addressed for the engineers implementing it. However, I think this is a great book for decision-makers, CIOs and others evaluating the technology. The foreword, done by an expert on the subject confirms it."
1,Where's the voice?,"It is a shame to see a book entitled Voice over IP Networks (published in 1999) dedicate 3 pages to H.323, nothing to emerging standards such as MGCP or SIP, and over 60% purely to ATM and IP."
5,A Very Informative Book,"This is a very informative book. Perhaps the author's mistake was to pack so much information into a single book, which seem to have prevented him from offering more in-depth analysis of the topics. Nonetheless, this book provides the bases and the pilars for an understanding of VoIP and the technologies it evolves. It was worth the investment. Hey, if you don't like it, just return it! But you won't know if you don't try it. :-)"
1,Save your money and wait for a better book.,"I made the grave mistake of purchasing this book, thnking that I would get some decent information regarding the topic of VoIP. What I received was a summarization of the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, outdated chapters on ATM (two of them, one of which the author didn't even write!) and solitations for the author's other book covering IP Multicasting. The editing of the book was absolutely the worst that I have seen - my 7th grader can edit better than this. I'm still looking for a good reference on the topic."
1,This book is not about VoIP,"Unbelievable! This summarizes my frame of mind after I attempted to read this book. Major waste of resources (paper, ink, McGraw Hill employees' time, etc.) and more importantly :-) my money!CD-ROM does NOT feature any demos or utilities. It is just a collection of pdf's and ppt's from ABL (by the way, their Director of Marketing praises the book big time in the foreword -- shameless plug), Nuera, and Telogy. You can get these files and more from these companies' Web pages. In fact, search the Web for ""VoIP"" and you'll be better informed, compared to reading this book.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
4,works better than expected,"As claimed, everything is packaged nicely in a great little traveling case.The router worked right out of the box. It's range isn't as wide as a full sized dual antenna router, but that is to be expected for such a compact unit.The surprise was the phone itself. Excellent at connecting to any wifi network out there. I was impressed at it's range and the quality of calls."
1,BAD battery life,"Excellent conectivity and performance, but very bad battery life. I buyed a new expensive battery from panasonic, in the hope that I solve the problem. But battery life is still only 14 hours in stand by. I don't recommend this product, waste of money."
3,Horsemanship,"Proff. Beery, More info about driving than riding but still some usefull stuff too. A bit old fashioned to read."
3,Middle school spanish,"It's OK for kids to practice the stem verbs ending, questions, adjectives, the verb to be, imperative, It has questions for kids to fill in answers."
4,No ballads in sight...This one rocks HARD,"So, I'm in the record store looking at the new Supergrass CD when I spy Evil Powers. I've heard of the Supersuckers before, but never actually heard any of their music. I look closely at the cover. The title brings a big grin to my face. Then I notice 8 Marshall stacks and 2 Ampeg bass stacks. Plus a crazy looking dude in a cowboy hat. OK, this looks promising. Buy the CD. Rip it open and put in the car stereo. The opening riff of 'Evil Powers' kicks in. 'Got evil blood and a twisted mind...'. This CD just rocks hard from front to back. Not a weak track here. 35 minutes of bone crunching riffs, rapid fire barre chords, snarling solos and humorous lyrics. About as un-PC as possible. Which is a good thing. One last comment. The CD is mixed so that it sounds good even of crappy stereos. It's a low, bass heavy mix with thick, distorted guitars. Crunch is the best word I can think of. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
1,Worst Deck I've Ever Skated,"This deck is terrible. I thought that it was a smart choice buying a blank deck hopefully with the same quality as a pro deck but i was wrong. It has no pop, its heavy, its thick and is the worst deck I've ever skated."
2,400 pages later,"I didn't learn anything ""new"" - combination of Conservative History since Goldwater followed by unflattering portraits of current rightwing politicos.As for entertainment value ... it reads like a political science thesis."
4,The Republican Noise Machine,"It's a great book and clearly documents many unscrupulous tactics by the right wing political machine. The only problem is that the right doesn't listen, care about or admit any wrongdoing because in a world guided by idealogies, ANY means justifies the end result---as long as you can make a lot of money and point out anything the otherside does wrong.Anyway, the book gives get detail, I wish the truth would matter in today's political climate."
1,Poor Excuse for a Book,"I was looking for an objective (or at least somewhat objective), factual book and instead came across what amounts to a comedy of errors. The ""author,"" and I use this term loosely chooses to join the Bush-bashing group who would rather hate than debate. If you are looking for logic and fact, you are looking in the wrong place. If you are looking for an adolescent diatribe, this is the book for you."
1,Unbelievably simplistic,"For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms:David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again."
1,republic,This author is not credible or an intelligent source for good information about the nation. The USA is not a democracy. Democracy is about mob rule. We are supposed to be a consitutional republic. With a very limited and not very powerful federal government. With states having more power.
4,I'm conservative and I approve of this book !,"If you're a non-conservative or a conservative fed up with the pathetic and lunatic rightwing radical nature of the Republican Party, this book is for you. A conservative turned independent liberal, the author exposes the devious nature of today's corrupt political conservatives that control the Republican Party and the government and the media. No wonder the people who write hate reviews of this book are scared to death that their days of playing politics are about to be TERMINATED.P.S.: He doesn't provide any solutions but I think there are better books for that such as George Lakoff's ""Don't Think of an Elephant"". Also, the book focuses on the Republicans's manipulations more than why the voters choose to accept the Republican liars."
1,"Zero Credibility- ""Journalist,"" For Sale to Higest Bidder.","David Brock, once the darling of the conservative right, now tries to claim that he was somehow coerced by the right and the money...so how does he remake himself? He grabs the cash offered up by the left and becomes a hired gun of the left. He alledges that he is the watchdog of all things conservative media...out to correct all the wrongs, errors and call to task Rush Limbaugh and friends. Please! this guy as ZERO Credibility! Hasn't any one wondered why the attack dogs of the left; Brock, Michael Moore, Algore, Ted Kennedy, George Soros, etc...are all of questionable credibility? Why can't the left bring forth an intelligent spokesperson who has more to offer then anybody but Bush?"
1,Love or hate it. It's that simple,In fact it's very simple. If you live in one of the liberal ghetto's like NYC LA or DC then you will probably love this book. However if you live in fly over country like the rest of us then you will be insulted beyond belief. This book is a good example of why it's so important to stay away from drugs and alcohol.
1,Half-Truths in Defense of Sex,"David Brock by his own admission lied for the Right. The right wing has bad guys and he worked for them. He lied for money and power. However, Brock had a problem. He was sexual unchaste and intended to remain so. The people who were hypocrites on the right were okay with that. . . but the good guys would not have been. Suddenly Brock becomes left-wing.Now we have a left-wing book full of half-truths in his breathless style. And so now Brock can hyper-ventilate on the left and keep behaving badly in private. That about sums up David Brock.Eventually his bad behavior will catch up with him. . . and we can hope he will repent and find peace."
4,I Like It,"I'd been looking around for something to help the rain sheet off my helmet face shield. Sure, if you're on the freeway, all you have to do is a quick look-back and the wind clears the shield but I wanted something that would work even when I'm stopped at a traffic light. This is the stuff. I couldn't be happier with it."
4,Works Well as General Cleaner,"This product works well to clean the plastic rear window in my Porsche Boxter. It gets the plastic clean and makes it very clear/shiny. It does not remove scratches, but it does reduce ""hazing"" and film that gets on the window. I would recommend this product as a general cleaner because it is very easy to use. It does not replace the paste you use to buff out scratches, but it is very good to keep you window conditioned and cleaned. I am planning to try it out on CDs and a few other items to see how it works."
2,"Interesting topic, poorly written","I was eager to read Forgotten Fatherland because of the fascinating and odd topic. Much of the story of the Nietzsches, the colony, and Paraguay comes through in the book, but in spite of the efforts of Ben MacIntyre. Ben MacIntyre's writing is embarassingly poor. His ideas are disorganized and poorly stated, and some of the metaphors are laughable."
5,human nature,"The five masterpieces in this collection deal with the dizzying pace of an industrializing world. Although the plays were written a hundred years ago, they are still very relevant to our modern existence. Chekov's questions about the place of class in a world in which class boundaries rapidly shift, the value of money in a world in which life has no meaning, and the meaning of existence in which experience is absurd still open our eyes to the many layers of existence which we uncover (or choose not to) every day.In today's world, which, like Chekov's, is changing every day, it would behoove all of us to sit down for a while every day and ponder the infinite wisdom of ""The Cherry Orchard"" (which is in this collection) and try to understand ourselves."
3,I like the Bill Smith narrated novels best. This is a Lydia.,"The first time I read a Rozan book, it was a Lydia Chin narrated book. I didn't like it at all. The second time, I read a Bill Smith narrated book and I couldn't believe that it was the same author. Now I've read another Lydia Chin and I'm kind of back to finding it only so-so.The Hong Kong part of the book is interesting, and the plot isn't bad as such, but so much of the book depends on Chin's inner life and I just don't find it that interesting. Accordingly, I never really managed to engage the book or really care about what happened.Back to Bill Smith for me."
3,"Exciting Setting, But Not Plot","I enjoyed the Hong Kong setting of this book, and I enjoyed the trust that honored elder Gao of New York's Chinatown placed in Lydia Chin. But the plot, which involves the kidnapping of a child in Hong Kong (the 7-year-old child, Harry, being the recipient of a jade necklace that Lydia and Bill are delivering to Hong Kong), seems to go all over the place, without satisfactorily going in any one direction. What's primary about this novel is the setting, which Rozan does excellently. If I am forced to choose between plot and setting, I would always choose plot, so I found this book somewhat disappointing."
4,addictive series,A friend of mine recommened Rozan's Lydia Chin and Bill Smith mysteries. I read one and now I'm hooked. This was the third in that series that I've read and I'm ready for more. This tale starts off in New York City and then quickly --- and chaotically --- unfolds in Hong Kong. Rozan uses both humor and tension to create a compelling story with very engaging characters. This is another solid addition to Rozan's delightful and underrated series.
3,Good Read But A Plot Problem,"This was a good read, but I think there was a problem with the plot.Spoiler Alert:Why would the kidnapper have chosen a person to demand a ransom when that same person was well known to the family from which he was demanding it? I didn't remember it being explained away anywhere and it didn't sit well with me.Otherwise, it's still worth reading."
1,A mess maker,"I thought this would be great-all the features I wanted for a low price. First off it began leaking all over the kitchen counter...the stop and serve feature is poorly made and the cover of the carafe is too small to allow the flow of coffee into it without overflowing all over the kitchen. I finally ripped off the top of the carafe and that has more or less taken care of the overflow problem, well one has to make sure the carafe is pushed way to the back and just in the right position...hard to do at 4 in the morning.Also it does require about twice the coffee grounds that my old maker used so the saving in price has definitely been lost in there. My recommendation is do not get this system. It gives one headaches!"
1,Another MESSMAKER !!!,"We just purchased another new Mr. Coffee coffeemaker, model no. UNX33. The latest on the market and the most expensive. Following all the instructions exactly, the filter basket overflows about 4 cups of brewed coffee and grounds all over the kitchen countertop. It appears the incoming water exceeds the outgoing coffee, thus overflowing brewed coffee and wet grounds all over the burner area and the countertop. This particular model has a very tiny pause N' serve stopper because the drip hole in the filter basket is also very tiny, about 1/4 inch diameter. Perhaps it is a flawed design, and we have contacted Mr. Coffee Concepts to see what they say about the problem.So, BUYER BEWARE, This model UNX33 Mr. Coffee coffeemaker is another great MESS maker !!! I will return to my stovetop perculator."
1,Dull in a week,"Bought this item and it arrived in one day which was very impressive considering I live in British Columbia. The knife looked great and was extremely sharp out of the box, but within just a couple uses I thought I could feel the blade getting duller. Telling myself it must be in my head as there were so many good reviews and other people telling me what a great product this was, I put it out of my mind. The next day I bought some dense rye bread and thought I would try cutting it with my new Global knife - even though I knew it was not a bread knife, I figured it would be fine... It did cut through the bread, however after about 6 slices I really noticed how dull the blade was...I could not believe it! Now after a few more uses on nothing harder than a carrot, it is as dull as a bread knife...I can literally slide it across my palm with no fear of cutting myself. I would like to know what the return policy is."
1,very cheap looking,the watch looks very cheap and nothing like i expected. I would not recommend to anyone. its just not worth the money.
3,Quality?,"The band broke less than three months from buying this watch. No hardcore duty with this thing, took it off before working on the car or anything that may scratch the watch. Opening a package and my hand hitting the side slightly snapped the rubber band. Would expect more from a watch like this, would have been better off with a $20 timex."
2,Not Rugged,"Although it maintains a rugged look, simply drop this watch and the minute and hour hands jam. Apart from that it had all other features I needed.I'm not the only one to have this happen."
2,Denon receiver codes?,With the codes it works for a Samsung LN52B750 and a Motorola DCH3200 cable box. With the two Denon codes available it does nothing for an AVR790. Not one button works anything on the receiver.
4,Nice remote! It lights up! Easy setup!,"I have a couple of different remotes and I bought a pair of these when they were on sale for less then $5.They are really nice and I appreciate the extra features of which several were lacking on my other remotes. I very much like that I can change the view (Wide,Zoom or Standard) on my TV as well as other extras that my other remotes do not have. I also like when you press any key it will light up the buttons for a short time. It is a bit big for a remote yet how else can you fit all of these buttons on here.I also appreciate that it uses 2 AA batteries rather then AAA. I also like that it comes with the feature that it will turn itself off if any button is held for more than 30 seconds. Like when it get stuck in the cushions of your furniture and the batteries run down, on my other remotes. happens to me.I recommend these to persons who want more than a basic remote yet are not ready to buy a Logitech Harmony."
5,I can't believe it's LIVE!!!!,"Von Zamla is incredible to say the least. If you are not familiar with this euro progressive rock band and you LIKE progressive, yet accessable rock... this is a no brainer- MUST OWN! I was familiar with Manna and subsequent solo efforts associated with the group. For 1983 (literally the year), this is an outstanding concert performence from Radio Brenman ((sp?) German radio)as remastered by Cuniform and the band. Simply a large leap in audio restoration... and the tunes are fresh especially today! Some of the melodic complexities remind me of Gentle Giant (in their hey-day) & Art Zoyd. The general beats are complex but not irradic. The recording doesn't sound live a live recording, until you here the applause. Exquisite spin!"
4,The first tournament,"This is not a book if you want to get into Dragonball. But those who have at least read the last book will enjoy this one greatly. The tournament has start and continues on in this book. It's a look of page turning action, a real pay off from the development of the last book. Just plan fun."
2,There are Better books,"Sure it covers a lot of areas. But its all from 50,000 feet. After done reading it, you may gain an general understanding of different subjects and area of interests of photography. There are not enough technical details to show how the result would be acheived. Don't expect this book to help you improve your photography skill. The pictures look like they come from the early 70s and certainly not creme of the crop. Many of them while relevant but not doing a good job showing the concepts.After reading other books, I've found this book a complete waste of money. 2 stars for the vast coverage."
3,Not one of Duke's best,"The one thing lacking in this CD is Duke's guitar. Even though there are several good tracks, Duke fans might be a little disappointed. A couple of the songs/arrangements simply seem to be out of place and disjointed. Still, there's enough on this CD to be worth it."
3,painfully out of balance,"I love the first 14 of the Elsie books. They are delightful, if unfortunately somewhat racist and sexist. They portray almost perfectly an allegory in terms of relationship with God as seen through the father child relationships of Elsie and her father, and Captain Raymond and his children, particularly Lulu. However, by book 15, Finley apparently overcome with a sense that children did not adequately appreciate history, left off the relationships and became obsessed with making these into history books. They are full of great historical points of view, unfortunately, much as I WANT to appreciate it, it bores me silly, and did my children as well. With a few brief exceptions, the rest of the series seems the same. How unfortunate that she did not balance them a little better, for she would have maintained readers, taught history, and still have a following today."
5,"Full of hope, inspiration and uplifting spirit!","Sam Harris gives his fans exactly what we've eagerly been awaiting with 'Revival', a return to the soul of music. His rich, emotional vocals will run you through an array of feelings from heartbreak to joyful celebration of life and love. You'll recognize a few of the song titles on this one including ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""Peace Train"", but the fresh new arrangements and rich vocals will make them seem brand new. The up-tempo ""Love Letter"" shows the fun side of Sam Harris and his genuine love of music. And if anyone can listen to the lyrics and his quiet then powerfully pleading vocals of ""Don't Let the World Step On Your Soul"" without feeling a ping in their heart, should seriously wonder if they have a heart! This is a collection of songs that is truly full of inspiration and promise and delivers exactly what it states- a 'Revival' of what Sam does best!"
5,MORE THAN 5 STARS!,"I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS REVIEW MORE THAN THE 5 STARS...SAM HAS DONE IT AGAIN! HE HAS CAPTURED OUR EMOTIONS, WITH HIS SELECTION OF SONGS & THEN JUST RIPS THROUGH OUR SOULS WITH HIS RENDITIONS OF NEW & OLD RECORDINGS. I JUST WISH THERE WAS MORE PUBLIC ADVERTISING OF HIS NEWEST CD & HOPEFULLY A CONCERT ON THE HORIZON WITH ALL THESE SONGS HE HAS RECORDED. DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOR & SPREAD THE NEWS ABOUT THIS SPECTACULAR CD...THE MORE THAT HEAR THIS, THE BETTER OFF THE WORLD WILL BE - IT IS FULL OF LOVE, HOPE & INSPIRATION - YOU WILL LOSE YOURSELF IN SAM'S VOICE!"
2,not at all impressed,"This CD doesn't even come close to his first CD. I was very disappointed in Sam's versions of songs like ""bridge over troubled water"". This is a CD I will most likely sell"
1,Soooo disappointed,"As a career-long fan of Sam Harris, I used to do one thing I rarely do for any other artist....buy the cd before hearing some of it. I had never been disappointed in his other recordings: Sam Harris, Sam-I-Am, The Best of Motown, Standard Time, Different Stages. I even own The Life and Grease broadway recordings. I love, them all. I can't say the same for this one. I listened to the whole thing when I first received it...one time. I tried listening to it several times after that, but couldn't. Now, I cannot remember the last time I played it. It is just not anything like what I had grown to love about his music. I'll have to be more cautious before buying anything else of his."
1,"Overblown Histrionics, Little Musicality","Although some over-zealous fanatics have been trying to push this CD, all of their hype only underscores the weaknesses in the performances and the selection of material. I'm sure it was intended to be a powerful, affecting CD, but without even a small nuance of subtlety, it's a one-trick-pony performance. If you are a fan of great, soulful singing, this CD is not for you. If you like over-the-top performances devoid of musicality and true feeling, this cult oddity may be of interest to you."
2,Ugh! It's boring!,"I have been a longtime fan of Sam Harris. I've seen him perform in person and have owned and enjoyed several of his recordings. I was delighted to find that REVIVAL had been released and ordered it promptly. I hated it. It's just the 'same old same old' Sam, showing very little growth over the years. I found REVIVAL to be just plain boring. Sadly, I will probably rarely listen to this CD and it will end up in my ""CD's I don't toss but don't listen to either"" pile. By the way, I liked the selection of songs, just not the presentation of them and Sam's become much more cute with age...for that he gets 2-stars."
1,One Star And Don't Try to Change It,"I've noticed that the number of stars gets changed on this. Some people give one star and then it's changed to five stars. Guess Sam's overzealous fans must be emailing the powers that be at AMazon.However, let it not be misunderstood: This CD is no great CD. One star is generous. It's not very good. His singing is extremely affected, unemotional and dull.I wish I could say I loved this CD. Wish I could say I even liked it. I HATED IT. It's the worst."
1,They had it right -- it's tripe!,"I about lost my lunch trying to get through this CD. I'm glad it speaks to some of you, but I find it totally cold and devoid of any real emotion and having very little musicality -- except for maybe those who like manufactured emotions and faux soul and community theater over-singing.Pass on this one."
5,Overall best masterpiece,"Positively, Sam Harris does have all the talent and this CD certainly is showcase for it. Everything is given better treatment. Full nuance, subtlety, finesse. I guess if you loved Star Search and all thoes mesmerizing singers going for the big, soulful crescendos, then you will hear everything you like here. If you like music, you won't believe your ears."
3,"Great taste, less filling","I came across this CD listed in Next magazine, and decided to buy it, remembering Mr. Harris' pipes in his early TV days. So I bought this more from curiosity than anything. The production is lush and unexpected in many places -- it really has a beautiful sound. His voice soars. My main problem is in the approach Mr. Harris takes to his performance -- I call it the ""Whitney Houston"" effect, where the performer has an astonishing voice but doesn't ever get ""down and dirty"" in any real or expressive way. It seems pretty calculated. He's got the pipes, I hope we can hear him in a less ""produced"" environment. Maybe a live album?"
4,SAM HARRIS IS THE BEST !,"I Love Sam's incredible voice and am a great fan. I own all of his album's, but saddly, I must admit, I prefer his former works. ""Different Stages"" and ""Standard Times"" included various styles from Musicals to ballads, from gospels to classics. It is clear with this album that Sam has found a new light (which I'don't mind, being a christian myself). Where my unhapinness comes from is that there are no real surprises here. But we all have different tastes. If U buy this CD you'll not dislike it, that's for sure ! A special mention for ""I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU"" dedicated to Laurie Beechman. If we have a best friend that song should be dedicated to him/her !"
5,Not the same Sam Harris I know,"I saw the show ""The Life"" with Sam Harris and liked him a great deal. I felt the same about the ""Standard Time"" disc but ""Revival is not the same Sam Harris....he's better! I don't think he needed a revival...but I'm sure glad he did this disc! Everyone will want to buy this brightly shining disc!"
5,What a GIFT!,"What is amazing about this CD is that it takes your view of hateful people and makes them melt away.The song Bridge over troubled water is so powerful. What I don't understand is if all these one-star reviewers got this fabulous CD as a ""gift"". Why on earth would they search for it on Amazon.com to tell the person that gave them this so called ""gift"" and the rest of the visitors that they hated it (for no reason). If these people actually did get this CD from someone, and this is how they thank them for this ""gift"", then the giver was certainly trying to tell the receiver/reviewer something. Maybe, to jump off a ""Bridge"".The song ""Come to me"" is so full of passion it is such a welcoming opening number to a collection of pure life loving inspiration.This CD is a ""Gift"" to all listeners!"
5,Hello and Thanks Lisa!,I want to publicly thank my friend Lisa for sending me a copy of this CD. It's really great and was such a wonderful gift. Clearly I have to get Jack his own copy since he has taken it all week for his drive to work. The CD is so full of positive energy. You got me hooked!
1,Minstrel Show Soul,"Uninspiring and boring. Overdone without any finesse or nuance. If you like big, over-the-top productions without any real emotion -- sort of Barry Manilow meets Jim Bailey as Liza -- then maybe you'll dig it. However, if you like great music and great, classic singers, then pass on this. It's not for us."
1,"Don't Think This Is Going to ""Revive"" His Career","Once upon a time, Sam showed potential, but never quite took off and was laden down with some really below-par albums and CDs. This is another misfire, as he tries to get all warm and fuzzy and touchie feelie."
3,I still like it,"I still like this CD but after a couple of months its not at the top of my playlist any more. I am a retired nurse who lives a lonely life in the mountains, and maybe thats just what happens. When I got this CD it was all I listened to, but now I sometimes listen to other things. I wish Sam was on MTV. Love Sarah"
4,"Good book, could be better","""The Salvation Controversy"" by Mr. Akin is a pretty reader friendly walk through the main points of contention between Catholic and Protestant Christians. A one star review mentioned that it lacks an analysis of intrinsic versus imputed righteousness. I haven't finished the book yet but it hasn't talked about it. Mr. Akin did teach me things I didn't know about Catholic penance and indulgences, as well as exposing myths about them. This is a good book overall, its a good answer to common myths about Catholic teaching."
4,Online CD tests are excellent,"I had already given the GMAT TestPrep online test and was looking for some more tests. Hence I picked up this book and gave the 3 online tests which come on the included CDi. I found these tests excellent .My final score on Gmat matched the score that I got on the last Arco CD test . (620,730,690)The only reason I did not give 5 is because I did not use the theory of Arco much.For reading/revision of theory and simple strategy, I found that Princeton review book is excellent.And for practice questions , official Gmat book is a good resource.-SPS: I posted this review by mistake to 2006.I don't know the difference between the two but the CD tests I gave were for 2007 edition."
1,"CD does not work, dies with INTERNAL ERROR","Just to warn you guys that the CD's does not work very well. I have tried to make it work many times and I still can't make the sample test to work. The software does provide a number to call, when the software dies with Internal Error. When I called the number they did not have the product in their database and needed a ISBN number off the CD, not the Book, and there is no ISBN number on the CD. Finally, the support person was able to get hold of one ""Master the GMAT"" title; from 2001 edition! I had bought the book for the stimulated tests and it doesn't work."
5,Excellent source for documenting family history...,"My sister-in-law bought this for my mom to fill out and I found myself ordering it as well for my mom to fill out for me. It has such beautiful illustrations and is a great keepsake for your most cherished family memories. If your mom is like mine, she can't remember too far back so this is a good purchase for that reason."
3,Short and harsh,"From previous reviews, I had expected the CD to sound like a mixture of Mouse on Mars and Oval. Actually, Model 3, Step 2 sounds like classic Oval. If you like Oval, you'll enjoy this CD (as I do). My only substantial complaint is that the CD is just too short for the price, clocking in at just about half an hour."
5,It's ok...,"Nothing spectacular to write home about. When I bought this book, I was hoping for the old radio dramas that I used to listen to when I was a kid on Sunday nights. I will say that there were some very good stories. But a few left you rather wanting."
4,Beyond the Visible:An Artist's Exploration of Spirit,"Beyond the Visible is a fascinating account of Ms. Ehler's journey through ten years of encounters with spiritual mentors of all kinds. She opens herself and shares with the reader her intensely private and personal experiences, and their effects on her loved ones. As a reader of many books on the Spirit, I found this volume to be unique in the author's frankness, and her expressions of her own fears in admitting to the rest of the world what she was going through. I also liked that this is a woman whose whole life did not crumble around her as she underwent the transformation to a deeper and richer spiritual life. Although the subject matter here is at times complicated, Ms. Ehlers' writing style is smooth and flowing. Anyone interested in spirituality will enjoy this book."
4,Meeting the God of Surprises,"Sandy McCartney Ehler's journey takes us down paths of mystery in our own lives. As she moves beyond the visible she is ever the nurturer, ever the devoted wife, living courageously through the wonder and pain of spiritual growth. Her prayer touches the reader's deepest longing: ""God show me what to do in the present moment and give me the strength to do it."" As we read of Sandy's eighteen year quest we too meet ""the God of surprises."""
4,An overlooked album that should've done much better!,"I bet you most of the people who have heard ""Unbelievable"" have no idea who even made it. And most of the people who bought Schubert Dip would've been satisfied with multiple versions of that song. When EMF released Stigma - a much more dark and grown up album, nobody bought it. Why? Probably because it wasn't the same thing all over again and... didn't have ""Unbelievable"" written anywhere on it.Stigma was a great album that sold terribly. If you're a fan of EMF I definitely recommend picking this up. I feel it was some of their best work and it was a shame it was overlooked."
3,Schubert Dip's Better,"This album sounds significantly different than EMF's previously constructed ""Schubert Dip"", which I regard as a highly good C.D.; but Stigma still has the same rhythmic styles except with such new features as angelic voices and an overall more noisy feel to it. The vocals on Stigma are a bit more outgoing than on Schubert Dip also, with two songs having unneeded language in them. The tune that I'd most recommend on this C.D. would probably be ""Inside"", which has the usual electronic patterns in the background, as well as high-pitched backing vocals and wild electric guitar. Although I would not recommend Stigma at full store price, I would at the dollar price I got it for.I recommend:They're HereNever KnowInsideGetting ThroughThe Light That Burns Twice As Bright"
3,total 3d v9,"since i live overseas, and this product was not eligible for international shipping (which makes little sense), i had it sent to a friend in the USA then they sent it to me in Saudi Arabia. then i get it and it does not even work with VISTA. clearly i should have looked at the product more closely - i was absolutely disappointed and very surprised - it looked like the most recent version! so right after i cut up the box and discarded it, i made this discovery and am very disappointed."
2,Could be Better,I was disappointed in this product. It was difficult to size rooms to the exact dimension. I started over many times. I wound up buying a more expensive design package.
4,good,This is a great product. I hate the fact that amazon asks for your opinion and then tells you how long you opinion must be. How about next time you write it yourself. Every time I go to a store I don't waqnt them to stop me a the checkout and tell me to review the store. Ask for my opinion.....I may or may not want to give it to you. BUT IT IS MY CHOICE NOT YOURS.
5,Worth the price,"This is a large sized stone with a good non slip base. The honing surface is reasonably thick, and very uniform. A minute of honing will turn a factory edge into a razor edge. No gimmicks, no bull. You see the results of your effort right now, and quickly learn to fine tune your technique. Unless you have very badly abused blades, this stone and a good steel will be all you need to keep an envious edge on your knives."
5,The real path to razor sharp.,"I bought this stone to detail the edge of the new set of Calphalon forged kitchen knives that I recently purchased. I have used oriental water stones in the past, and this stone is as good as any I have used. With just a few strokes, it will turn a Calphalon, Henckles, or Wusthof into a Gillette. With this stone and a good steel, your knives will last far beyond your years."
1,Deceived,"The seller, in his detailed description of the book, ""forgot"" to mention that it was just the first volume (of two). I think that was really dishonest."
2,Not Quality!,It is Not the quality of original. It vibrates when moving. I would get original in wrecking yard next time.
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge Iyanla fan, but even she has a bad day. This tape was a disappointment, expecially after being fired up with the ""Faith"" tape. The quality of the sound was not good, her singers were not on their game and the message seemed to come in the last 5 minutes of the tape. You found Iyanla rambling on and on mostly. I will still try the other cassettes but this one, you can pass on."
3,"Ilyanla Live!: Self Value, Self worth & Self Love","I enjoy watching Iyanla on TV, and I have read a couple of her books, this was the first time I purchased one of her tapes and was very disappointed. The sound quality is poor. I found myself turning the volume up and then down, and then at times I couldn't hear anything at all. It started out with singing, which I guess is alright if that is what you had expected, but I didn't see the connection in the overly long singing introduction to the tape subject. She had a few good points that she brought out, and made one think. There were maybe 20 min. of interesting subject matter to listen to: I would not recommend this particular tape."
5,VENOM.....in a BIG way ! this is the real deal...,"this version of everybody's favorite symbiotic villian..is incredible..the sculpting is top notch and very detailed...and you get that famous slime drenched tongue! that only a mother could love heheh thats completly poseable...this venom comes with a book telling you about the origin of venom etc.. face it if you are a hard core spidey fan..or a venom fan..this one is a no brainer..(i remember one of venom's lines from the books to this day and i still laugh... venom kicks spideys rear singing...""hes gonna die, hes gonna die! oh happy happy!!""now that the spider man 3 film is out, a lot of people have been crying about the movie venom not being bulked up enough etc..well theres a reason for that..thats hollywoods version...personally i think they did a good job..they wanted venom to be realistic. but if you want the actual venom that we all know and love...grab this one if you can..you wont be dissapointed. Nuff said."
5,A slice of our history,"As a 20-something, I find it fascinating to read or hear about the lives of gay men during the last century. Picano weaves an intricate tale of the two cousins Roger and Alistair, about how their lives intersected at pivotal points in our shared gay history. I especially enjoyed the scenes set on Fire Island - though only a generation removed, the fun they depicted seems from another world. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the glbt movement in the latter half of the 20th century, and how remaining loyal and diligent to friendships can make a difference in our lives."
1,Every cliche in the book,"This book is embarrassingly bad. I find it incredible that he got it published. Every character is an unbelievable cliche. He tries to include everything that has happened to the Gay community in the US over the last few decades, and it all ends up reading like a really, really bad romance novel. Yuck."
4,Like People in History: Textbook reading,"Like people in history IS certainly campny and to a degree, not very believable; nonetheless, it chronicles major events in (gay) history: the pre-Stonewall sixties, followed by the revolution and the disco-glam culture, followed by the remorse, apathy, regret and reflection of the nineties and AIDS. It certainly is not a believable book in that it isn't dealing with the average gay man's life. Nonetheless, for gay men who want to know where we come from, and what we have endured, the book is exellent in giving a broad overview of the final decades of the 20th century."
2,Forgettable....in fact I think I have!,"...I read this endless book over a holiday in Mexico this past year. Think of Crystal and Alexa from the campy television show Dynasty, and you have the lives and depth of these two characters. I wish I could say it was trashy fun, and maybe it would have been if it had been severely edited. If you want to read someone who can accurately chronicle gay lives, read Andrew Holleran's Dancer from the Dance, The Beauty of Men, and his collection of short stories, In September the Light Changes. He is a master storyteller, and very adept at creating sympathetic and real characters."
1,"A pretentious attempt at an ""epic""","Picano, who wrote a very good mystery years ago called THE LURE,attempts a GONE WITH THE WIND style sweeping saga but falls short. The main fault is the shallowness of the characters - they're all gorgeous, talented, rich, etc. Alistar, the fey one, is a Wall Street genius at age nine and an equal wizard on the baseball diamond. Please. He and Roger manage to be the Forrest Gumps of the Stonewall set; they turn up at all the major historical events of the last forty years, but Picano's handling of these episodes is sketchy at best. Anyone calling this a ""masterpiece of gay literature"" or a masterpiece of any sort of literature needs to spend more time in the library and less on the beach. Oh well. At least Picano didn't resort to present tense. That deserves one star."
2,Book lover - Philadelphia,"I found this book very disappointing. Unlike Karen Hawkins' other books, I wasn't absorbed by the story and kept putting it down when it couldn't hold my attention. The characters are flat, uninteresting and all too predictable. It feels as if the author was more focused on writing a set-up for a new series than in creating a good story, believable characters or humorous/romantic situations - the hallmarks of her previous series."
3,Something Was Missing,"I can't pinpoint what was missing in this book but something was. The idea was good, but it left me empty. There was no life, spark that something that makes a book great. The thing that makes you laugh and cry and all warm inside. This book was just there - not great not bad. The characters were a little boring to say the least, the only one I cared for was the butler ""Reeves"". The concept of the book was good but she left alot to be desired. But on a brighter side, the book was a ok if not nice read, it just could have been better. Mrs. Hawkins has so much potential that she fails to use."
3,it was Okay!,"after reading the prologue. I coulnt wait to read about his journey to reunite with his brother..But I found Tristan hardly mentioned his brother at all...which was a disappointment , becuase for me the back story was the most interesting part of the book. Karen did not give any details as to what he went through searching for his brother. But thank God for the butler..love his character!!! brotherly reunion story came late but i really enjoyed it(fighting scene was intense)!!!..Notice i am only going on about the back story...Thats becuase the back story, even the scenes with his father were the most enjoyable moment in the book...Did not feel the chemistry from these love birds..kept wanting for more scenes with his brother , whom i cant wait to read about!!"
5,One of the best...,"This is only my second book by the author and she's becoming a fast favorite. This is a great book! It has strong characters, just the right amount of romance, and leaves me anticipating Christian's story. Worth the read, I promise you won't be disappointed."
2,WEAK!!!,"I really loved the story line... there was so much potential, so much bought up that never went any were... I was soooo let down!"
2,Bodice Ripper,"I bought this from my Kindle, and didn't really look at the picture. If I had, I would have known it was a ""Bodice Ripper"" and passed, but once I had it I decided to read it.I suppose the story is ok as far as it goes, it's an interesting premise, but could have been executed better. This title was obviously ""patterned"" after the Patrick O'Brian Aubrey Mauturin novels and should have at least shown SOME evidence that she had read them, even if only for historical accuracy. A navel captain of the time would not have refered to ""Tinder"", he would have said ""Oakum"". I know that is a small thing, but there's more. _REALLY_, at the end he SELLS THE HMS VICTORY????? That would be like me selling the USS Missouri!!!!C'mon Karen, If you are going to write something, do your homework."
2,disappointed,"I am a fan of Ms. Hawkins previous books, but could not like this one. The premise was good, but the story didn't deliver. I felt that the relationship between the two main characters and the story itself, were rushed, and the characters lacked depth. The cliche's, especially the naval cliche's, were ultimately annoying. The book could have also benefited from better editing, as there were many inconsistencies."
3,"Not great, not awful","This was probably my least favorite of her books I've read, and even so it wasn't all bad. I think it could be in part because I read Her Officer and Gentleman first, and this one takes place before it. But overall the characters just didn't click as well as in the other stories, I didn't feel as drawn into the story, and the plot was less-than-exciting (and yes, that's partly because I had read the second book first). I'd say it's worth it for a lazy Sunday read, but I'd suggest her Talisman Ring series over this one. Those are some truly wonderful romance novels!"
2,A spiritual journey that has nothing to do with CFS,"I'm all for enlightenment, but this book was basically about how to use your illness as your 'spiritual burden' in order to become a better person. Nothing about how to really heal or get better, and she admits that she is still ill.So if you are looking for spiritual meaning behind your illness, this would be a great book to read. If you are looking to get better, skip this one."
3,The return of the kings of dark R.I.O,"This is the album of the reunited Belgian R.I.O progband Univers Zero. I was quite excited to get this one as I am a big UZ fan. I was delighted to hear that oboist Michel Berckmans was back. So how is the music? If you haven't heard anything of this group I'd rather recommend ""1313"" or ""Ceux du Dehors"". The music on this album tries to return to that of these albums, and succeeds sometimes, as with the first track ""Vieux-a-Manants"" which sounds medieval, with the typical use of harmonium. The musicians all play well throughout, but I think that the album's weakness is the compositions which lack the passion, melancholy and darkness of their classic albums. They sound more like the somewhat dismal pieces of Daniel Denis'solo albums. Still it's a decent album that is worth having, hopefully Daniel Denis and co. will be more succesful on their next album."
3,It's a quality knife but it *feels* too light,"I can't complain about the quality and I'm not. It's clearly well built as my research suggested before buying. This is my first non Henkel/Wustoff purchase ever though, so it was a bit of an experiment. It cuts great and keeps its edge.So why only three stars? Because it feels cheap. Again, it's *not* cheap. But it's so light and the handle is so thin that if you are used to a solid, heavy, sturdy-feeling chef's knife in your hand, you may be disappointed in the Global product.Apart from this being a personal preference issue, a chef's knife often needs to move through tougher foods than veggies. Cutting through chicken bone or splitting open a lobster tail requires a bit leverage and a good grip. I want my paring knife to be smaller so can I maneuver it around a tomato core. But I need my chef's knife to work harder sometimes."
5,"If This Is Your Type, An Excellent Choice","Though I have larger hands, I prefer my knives to be very light and well balanced. I save the heavy Henckels-style crunching for other tools. My knives need to glide in and out of onions, fish, and the like. This does the job and then some. If you haven't treated yourself to your first proper chef's knife, you're missing out and it makes cooking an entirely different task. I say without embellishment that this is the sharpest non-surgical edge I have ever felt when out of the box. It's frightening! I doesn't so much cut as it splits atoms. A few weeks of hard work into it and the edge is well retained. Just maintain it as you should and it'll last for many years to come."
5,Global G-2 knife,"The knife is excellent and I am very happy with it. I got it right before Thanksgiving and I'm glad I did. If you are using a dull knife, you don't realize what a liability (and safety hazard) it is. One of the things about this knife that appealed to me is the ability to be sharpened at home with a stone. I couldn't get a sharp edge on the stainless steel knives I had. The Global knife is light as far as knives go, so that is an issue of personal feel and preference.I purchased this knife on the recommendation of Anthony Bourdain from one of his books. If you want more of what he says about the knives you need in your kitchen, just google it. His advice is very reasonable and will save you from unnecessary purchases.I also highly recommend his books for entertaining reading as long as you are not easily offended by vulgarity or strong opinions. If you like his show, No Reservations, you will like the books.Overall, the knife is a winner and it looks really cool too."
3,"Expensive, pretty and not easy to sharpen","I don't know what it is about this particular knife. I have no trouble sharpening my other Global knives. I also do a fine job with my Wusthof, F. Dick and others. I think the weight of this knife is also a bit light for a chef's knife. I love the santoku and the next size down from there. They are a great weight and balance. I would not highly recommend this particular knife. Globals are great for me, just not this one."
4,A wonderful tool,"The Global 10"" is a great knife that comes with a very sharp edge. It is rather light (at least for a 10"" knife) and is well balanced. It is well situated for both slicing meats and cutting and dicing vegetables, as it is easy to hold the knife forward towards its blade for a quick and balanced wrist action. The only reason I gave this knife 4 stars and not five is due to the handle. While it is dimpled it can still get slippery when cutting fatty meat. I would prefer a synthetic handle covering, but otherwise this is a well designed tool -- perhaps the best chef's knife available now."
4,Cut through a whole chicken like nuthin!,"I just got my Global chef's knife last week. First cut was to split a chicken in half. It did it with one clean slice. No chopping, just slicing. No bones about it, I was amazed. Time will tell how well this knife holds up but all indications is that its got legs. The second chore was to slice fruit the next morning, it handled this job with aplomb."
5,Kitchen confidential Tips and tricks,"Based on Chef Tony's recommendations, I put this knife on a Christmas wishlist and was superbly delighted that the Chef knows what he's talking about. The 8-inch Chef's Knife is light, sharp, and versatile. Meats, veggies, fruits, fish don't stand a chance. I recently received another of Chef Tony's suggestions: the Wusthof offset-serrated knife (it's available here for 30-some dollars) and between these two, there's nothing you can't do in the kitchen. Who is Chef Tony? Anthony Bourdain. Go get ""Kitchen Confidential"" and find out what I'm yammering about :)"
5,Global Knife,I have another global knife and this one is just as good as the one I have. It is an excellant product
5,Sharp and lightweight,"I'm not a knife connoisseur yet, and this is my first Japanese knife. It is absolutely awesome. The edge is so sharp and thin that it cuts through everything like butter. Be careful! I cut myself very easily on the bottom corner point that meets the finger rest next to the handle. It actually made me smile, because it was so sharp -- I barely touched it! Excellent knife, makes chopping and dicing a snap, great weight and balance. The textured handle feels sort of like a golfball, very comfortable in your hand. The manufacturer recommends a ceramic sharpening steel for this knife to help keep it at its sharpest. Love it!"
5,"wonderful, high quality knife","I recently acquired one of these from a local store. The clerk highly recommended it for it's ease of sharpening and retention. The knife is wonderful! I've never used a knife so sharp, and this is factory sharpened, not even professionally done. The knife is light weight, so it is more about precession than power. It balances wonderfully, and the grip is great. All together a wonderful piece for any kitchen. I plan on acquiring a whole set as my budget allows."
5,Great Knife,I read about this knife on the Cooking for Engineers web site. This was my first high dollar knife. I was tired of the cheap knifes. Have been using it for a month now and love it.
5,A very handy Global 8-Inch Chef's Knife,"Wanted it very much, now my wife realizes why...It made her very happy. We finally have a very good kitchen nife"
5,My favorite...,I own both wusthof-trident and henckels sets but this is my favorite knife. I wasn't sure if a 10 inch was too large and unwieldy but this knife is beautifully balanced and so light weight that I have had no problem. Another great featuere is the fact that it is one solid piece so there is no yucky gunk that gets trapped in the haft or hinge area.It sharpens very easily on a hardware store whetstone and for the finicky there are cheap knife guides available from the manufacturer to guarantee that you have the correct angle when grinding and sharpening.If you want light weight with a very nice edge in combination with easy maintenace I would choose Global over either Wusthof or Henckels. For the style conscious -- it is very cool looking indeed.
1,Knife broke in two,Bought the knife less than a year ago. I accidently dropped it on the kitchen floor when I was putting it away and it broke in two. I have never had a knife break in this way. Liked the knife until then although it didn't stay as sharp as I would like. The Global return policy also is confusing and looks like I will not be able to get a replacement.
3,Not so sharp,"I finally got my hands on one of these and can tell you it is not ONE HALF as sharp as my MAC knife. It is brand new from xmas '06. the grip is better thanI expected and balance is fine, BUT I had to lean on the sucker to get through some carrots. I also sliced some steaks for fajitas and slivered onions. It scares my precious fingers when I have to put so much pressure on the knife. If you are going to slooowwly slice something firm this might work for you.I shopped around for a long time before settling on the MAC. I'll put it up against ANY other knife. Try your GLobal on a butternut squash and a similar size MAC: you will see. The MAC literally falls through the veg."
4,didn't resist,"This was $70 on a Friday Sale and I went for it instead of paying half as much for a dishwasher safe Victorinox. Tsk, tsk.Although Victorinox is cheaper, dishwasher-able, rated as the best by Cook's Illustrated, the seamlessness of Global satisfies my neurosis."
4,"Cashy, but very comfortable to use","Very well made, but for the money, I would expect more attention to removing machine marks and burrs. I took one star away for the finish-I spent a little time polishing burrs and deep tool marks off of the spine. Otherwise the knife is sharp, well balanced, and handles very easily. The blade profile is a bit different, but it works well. I have no problems with the handle being slippery-the knife is light, balanced and sharp-you don't need much grip pressure to stay in control."
5,knife,very sharp!why do i need to explain my inpression in so many words? isn't two words enough?it it necessary to write so many words?
5,It is shaaaaaarp!,"I bought one for my daughter a year ago and finally bought one of my own recently and it is the most amazing knife imaginable. As a vegetarian, I use it constantly for chopping and so on and it is simply effortless. Money very well spent as I know it'll last a lifetime."
1,This album REALLY sucks!,"No other band in the world has successfully duplicated Slayer. Trying to pay ""tribute"" to them with this piece of dirt is even worse.I swear this sounds like the same untalented band played all the songs, and they just made up a different band name for each tune they covered."
1,Not even close,"I don't even understand why this pathetic tribute album was even allowed to be released. The death metal edge added to the songs was horrible; most of the songs just sounded like a barking dog attempting to sing Slayer songs. If the band members of Slayer actually heard this poorly conducted tribute, then they would probably die of laughter when they hear how much their songs have been butchered."
2,Slayer cannot be copied,I never want to hear an album like this again! No one sounds like Slayer & no one should ever try copying any of their songs!
4,Excellent progression for De trop!,"The new material by De trop is well worth listening to, and I agreew ith the other reviewer.. its amazing how such a lo-fi band can sound lush.. It certainly does go on a musical journey, and was great to work to and listen... its been on my player constantly since I got it.You will not be dissapointed!"
1,DO NOT USE UNBOX!,It's been over 24 hours and my video is still only 32% downloaded. This is the absolute worst program I've evr used.
4,Works Fine,"I wasn't aware that they made rakes that kept the bark and dirt where it was supposed to be, until I stumbled upon this. It works great and isn't super expensive. Good use for flower beds and areas where you don't want to disturb the soil too much."
4,Fiskars 8-Inch Shrub Rake #9661,"Very light, very handy under tight spaces and you don't have to spear this thing like bigger and heavier rakes, just reach it out and put it down, pull the claw back and towards you with a little elegance in your posture, too bad though the claw are too thin and it bounces more than I wanted from time to time. Other than that, the design of the claw really works."
4,Rake away!,This rake was perfect for under the tree branches of an evergreen when you want to rake up dead needles. The small 8-inch rake combs in a large quantity of debris which is good. You can spot the orange handle when put aside. Great product!
5,Useful for getting sleep!,"If you're stuck in a vicious cycle of going to sleep late, waking up in time for work, being tired, and repeating this all over again... this product works. I take one tablet about an hour before I ideally want to start sleeping and I'll start to feel tired and in the mood to sleep. It doesn't really make you feel drowsy, which is great. I recommend this product as a cheap and effective way to help regulate when you want to sleep."
3,SPARK PLUGS,"This product doesn't fit my car... a have a Nissan Versa 2007 S, but the Autolite sparkplugs are for a 5/8"" and the originals are 14 mm."
5,Works of Friedrich Nietzsche,Happy to have this in electronic for so I can carry it with me when traveling and have something non-technical to read that provides some solace to my non-existant soul.
5,Coast To Coast,I recieved the item quickly and in excellent condition. I would be happy deal with this merchant anytime.
1,"Good concept, but mediocre versions of the songs","You've probably heard these songs before...but not by these artists. These are not the original hits, nor anything close -- they're cover versions of some great songs, but done in mediocre to abysmal versions, some by artists who shouldn't be singing them. Tony Bennett's version of ""Chicago"" is so bad, I couldn't get through it. Nat King Cole recites ""Route 66"" -- no melody to be found. Dinah Shore comes through with ""Mississippi Mud,"" and there are some passable versions of other tunes, but not enough to make this a keeper. Bottom line, you don't need this in your collection."
3,SCI takes foray into light jazz,"Carnival '99 was my introduction to SCI. I am a fan of all the ""jam"" bands that they are associated with and so I was confindent in buying before listening. CD 1 confirmed my expectations that this is a serious band with good compostitions and a great flair for improvisation. It had a funky blugrass flavor that I liked. CD 2 took a sharp turn for the worse though. The first 5 compostitions were an undistinguished collection of ""light jazz"" meanderings that reminded of bands like Spyro Gyra. Their attempts at Hip-hop and Improvised story-telling near the end of CD2 I also felt were amateurish and unconvincing."
2,ho-hum,"I bought this after hearing ""Birdland"" on Sirius radio. It sounded pretty good, so I began to look for it. Who was it on the radio? I looked and looked and finally stumbled on it. Wow! I ordered it. I played the ""Birdland"" cut and enjoyed it. The rest is bluegrass. I'm not a bluegrass fan. And really, jam bands, with the exception of the Allman Bros., usually don't impress me. Yes, there are some catchy parts, but not enough.I'm sure I've angered a lot of you who love this stuff. I apologize. This review doesn't mean I think these guys aren't accomplished musicians; they are. This double cd set of music is stuff I don't like. And I don't want to sit thru the whole thing to catch a jewel like ""Birdland"". So, this'll make a fine Christmas gift for my niece's husband."
3,There Big,I purchased these for my flatbed trailer. I was tired of not being able to see the sides of it. I was also tired of people getting a little to close to it trying to change lanes and not being able to see it since its all black. My only issue and the reason for the 3 stars is the fact that these are much bigger then they look. They will stick out to far so I wont be using them. I will be going to the same style thats on my aluminum flatbed instead. Those are from Flip Flop LED. Nothing wrong with the product just bigger then I want.
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book for all men (married or single, with or without children). Gordon McDonald does excellent work in laying out the responsibilities that us fathers have to our wife, children and society. Direct and to the point. Filled with real life experiences and examples. Aside from the Bible, this is the best tool I have come across for us men to understand our role in this world and the expectations of us in our life."
2,Bad Research,"Biggest problem being the resources he failed to use. I felt more accurate information on VENONA and other topics is readily available in the mass market. This amounts to ""pop"" non-fiction and is not to be taken too seriously. I don't doubt that Kessler managed to get some of his juicy 'tell all' items correct, but what percentage? Save your money."
1,Pathetically biased,"I suppose it's too much to ask that any book dealing with J. Edgar Hoover could even pretend to be objective (and still get published), but one might hope for a little effort on the part of the author in disguising the personal defamation. The author's first attack on Hoover related to his investigation of several individuals during WWI for seditious, anti-war comments and his getting them sent to jail (in violation of their 1st Amendment rights). Well, this was Hoover ENFORCING THE LAW! The Espionage Act pushed through by Woodrow Wilson and a Democratic Congress made it a crime to publish or state anything derogatory of the current administration. Also, as a mid-level FBI officer, Hoover couldn't put anyone in jail anyway, they had to be tried in court and convicted by a jury. Yet the author doesn't even hint that this was anything but Hoover's own personal crusade. Based on that (within the first 10 pages), how could one take anything else the author says seriously?"
3,History,I learned some things about the FBI. Out all the books I have read The USSS is the one I have respect for. This book covered the history well.
4,The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI,"I've read other books by Ronald Kessler, and find his style of writing somewhat unusual. In this book, he hops around frequently, as if new ideas are popping into his head, which makes for a hard read at times. However, that being said, the book is excellent. It is well researched, with footnotes galore, and very factual. I know people that work for the FBI and I have been told the info in the book is spot-on. It's very very interesting. But, you have to like this stuff. Otherwise, you might find the content dull or unexciting."
3,"Entertaining, Good Reading","This book seems to be divided into two sections: the first half deals with the FBI under the stewardship of J. Edgar Hoover; the second half deals with the FBI under each of the different heads after Hoover died. I enjoyed the part about Hoover better than the second half. It shows the rise of the FBI and talks about the iron-fisted leadership under Hoover (and what a grand schemer and blackmailer he was).The second half leaves you wondering how the FBI has made it this far today - with its spies, 10 year old computer systems, misguided direction under Freeh and Sessions. These stories in the second half of the book suggests that the FBI has survived despite itself!The book is worth reading - not the great book that others describe, but not bad either. It's worth a read if you want to know about the FBI history."
3,Entertaining enough,"I read this book going into it unbiased. But it was very bias. I didn't care because I was expecting it to be based on the title I just thought it would be interesting to read, and it was. So if you are looking for a fast read this isn't bad."
3,Almost really good,"Uses a birthday party event to teach some basic words and phrases. The context is easy to understand. The simple songs help reinforce the learning. My 2 year old watches this and we will probably both learn some Spanish from it. I like that I have the option to just play the video and skip the exercises because my child isn't old enough for the exercises. My complaints are 1) sometimes the accompanying instrumental music is so loud that its hard to hear the words clearly. 2) It would help if they would put the Spanish text up on the screen (as well as the English, maybe English in smaller text). That would help when its hard to hear the pronunciation clearly. 3) The acting is awkward. I'm not sorry I bought it and will probably buy more in the series, but I do wish that the creators of these things would look at the product a little more closely before production because it wouldn't have been much more work to make it much much better."
2,Very Disappointing,"Based on the reviews, I bought this dvd thinking it would reinforce the Spanish my two year already knows. However, this is a very low quality production, and the host does not even seem to know how to speak Spanish. Then there is the instance when-while supposedly teaching the kids how to count slices of cake- the narrator jumps from cinco (5) to siete (7). Ridiculous! If you have abosolutely no idea of how to speak/read the Spanish language, and just want to mildly amuse your child for five minutes, this is the product for you. But if you are seriously interested in your child learning a second language, this is not for you. Take it from someone who is fluent in Spanish, this is a total waste of your time and money."
3,OK,"This was acceptable. I very much liked the Spanish immersion part, with complete sentences, in a family setting! Although, it seems like most of the words were already in our vocabulary. (not the video's fault). But, really, it was kind of mediocre. Also, I find it curious that they offered (food? or balloons, or what not) to the female or child first, not the head of household male? Is that not the tradition? Or Guests first? perhaps, ...Thank you for your time."
2,"Good stuff, but not much of it",I think Lanugage tree did a good job at creating this dvd. The format is fun and interactive. However my daughter finished the whole thing in about 30 minutes. It contains about one Spanish class-time worth of information. I just didn't feel that was worth the price tag.
2,spanish for kids,i bought this for my son. he did not like it at all. he said it did not help him learn spanish.
2,"Only appropriatte for very young, but also bad quality","This DVD is only suitable for very young children (approx aged 4-6). The presenter is a man dressed up as a tree and there's a lot of very cheesy animation and childish music that is embarrassing to an older child. My son is eleven, and although he's pretty young for his age he was way too old for this DVD.The sound quality is also very poor, during the songs, it's difficult to hear the words (which are awfully high pitched) over the music. When the animated dog is speaking, because you can't follow any lips moving, it's even harder to decipher what's being said. It's often difficult to understand what's going on, but you are encouraged to learn the voacabulary anyway.I think younger children might enjoy the DVD and the quizes but it isn't a very impressive learning tool."
4,Great if you can read,"This is great for kids who can read. However, my 4 year olds can not read yet. It keeps their attention for a little while but not through the whole video. It is easy to understand what is being said in Spanish. However, there are English subtitles rather than English being spoken. The characters act out what is being said, but order for my children to understand exactly what the Spanish words mean I have to sit with them every minute that the video is on and constantly read the subtitles. With the Professor Parrot video the English and Spanish words are spoken so that my kids can understand it better. I would rate it higher if my kids were old enough to read the subtitles."
2,Somewhat entertaining,"My kids (ages 6, 5, 3, and 2) all watched this together once. They watched it all the way through... but have never watched it again. If I ask them if they'd like to see this video again, not one of them says yes. Good enough for one viewing, but not good enough to watch again."
3,Keith Frank Live,"I was a little disappointed in this CD. Mostly because of the production quality. The vocals overpower the instruments on this mix and make it hard to listen to, in my opinion. It just sounds a bit ""noisy""."
4,Fun and handy but could grind a little finer,I love the convenience of the pepper ball. You can't beat one-handed grinding! My only gripe is that I can't grind the pepper to a fine dust like I can with my tall wooden old-style two handed grinder.
5,HOW DO YOU REFILL?,"This is a great product. But how do you replace the peppercorns?? Maybe mine was made wrong, but I cannot for the life of me find where the opening is. There is a review saying that the vertical door opens, but mine will not. Is there a seperate release for it? I am stumped! Please help! ( )."
4,Help For Austin Texas....Refill,I agree with you that it is a great product. I just found how to refill mine. It is a slot on the side that slides down and you just poor the peppercorn in. Hope this helps.
3,How do you clean it?,"I see many people asking how to fill it...but my question is how do you properly clean it?I cannot believe someone who has been faithful to this ball for 10 years has never cleaned it...so please, tell me how does this thing get a good cleaning>"
2,Too Coarse,"Great potential, but very disappointing as even on the finest setting, the pepper comes out very coarse. Would not recommend if you need a fine mill as well."
3,"Good, but...","The grinding is excellent, but I couldn't help worrying about eating little plastic particles. You see, part of the grinding mechanism is made of plastic.This was a big drawback for me, so when it fell and broke (not the grinders fault: it fell off my window!) I was kind of relieved and bought a regular grinder instead (which doesn't grind as good but keeps me unworried)."
2,"When it worked, it was great.","This item shorted out after three months of use. Which is unfortunate, because it's a good remote."
1,Weak piece of junk,"This thing is so weak, you really can barely even tell its on. Its also quiet so that adds to that somewhat. It uses tiny little watch-type batteries, so when you run out if you have to get weird replacements, also I imagine the batteries won't last very long with such tiny batteries. It also explains why its so weak. Save your money get something else."
2,FINER VIBRATOR,"The finger vibrator doesn't have enough power to it, so if you are looking to climax in 2-3 minutes, don't order this product. And the attachments break easily when inter-changing."
1,Horrible,This product was a HUGE HUGE disappointment. Was not really made for the description provided. Directions were basically nonexistant. Once I got the product started it kept quitting and turning itself off. Power not strong enough to even feel. After an hour of trying to mess with the product I became so aggitated that I threw it away. Horrible waste of money. I do not recommend purchasing this unless you are looking to waste money
1,Hurts,It gave me a cut and now I have a boo boo. P.s pokemon is a fun ds game and you should get it. And the products hurts!
4,not bad underrated marvin gaye,"not my favorite album by gaye but if you're a serious fan you'll find some serious bangers in heavy love affair, funk me, and in our lifetime the cover grabbed me back in the early 80's daz dillinger copied the artwork on his first album in 98."
4,A great album indeed!,"I'll keep it simple, Marvin Gaye is on of the best artist to have emerged in the modern twentieth century. I am and will always be a fan."
4,Best Werther recording since the 1930s,"I will admit that I am ""imprinted"" on the Georges Thill/Ninon Vallin recording from the 1930s and no recording since then has even come close. But this recording does. Alagna (who is a native French speaker, in spite of the Italian name) has the diction and, more important, the style to sing poor Werther perfectly. Gheorghiu sings beautifully as well, and there is no problem with the tessitura, in spite of Charlotte generally being more comfortable for mezzos. Pappano is an up-and-coming conductor who does himself proud with this recording. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this one."
5,The best true-crime and forensic show ever?,"My favourite true crime and forensic tv shows are 'The Real CSI: The New Detectives', 'The FBI Files', and 'Arrest & Trial'.The Real CSI is a hell of a lot less dramatized than 'The FBI Files', but ironically, the lack of dramatic acting, the narrator, the background music, and atmosphere actually make it a more hitting, stunning, and real. Most of the shows involve local police and sheriff's office, and very rarely the FBI. This seems to make the crimes feel more real and understandable in laymens terms.I am now of the opinion that this is actually a superior program to all it's competitors. My idea of fun is to watch this late at night, lights dimmed or off, on a huge Philips LCD tv (42-52 inch), with a logitech z-5500 surround sound system, and scare the living crap out of myself. Forget horror movies, there is nothing more scary than real life, real stories, and the psychology between human beings hurting each other.'Man is the cruelest animal'."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The New Century Countdown Show music is disappointing in several ways. First of all, almost all of the first set of tracks are shortened versions of the various characters' songs. Secondly, the second set of tracks consists of average-quality songs. Only Stone Monkey and Kagayaki stand out. Yume no Tsuzuki, Hanasaku Otome, and Gekitei are good, but they're performed in practically EVERY live show, so I don't consider those songs to be good reasons to buy the CD.The Spring Song Show (New Year Revue), which took place two weeks later, has more interesting songs. I would recommend that New Year's show over the Hanagumi Countdown show. The New Year Revue DVD is especially enjoyable, as it has a skit, a drum performance, and even a preview of Kaijin Bessou, the fifth song show performed in August 2001."
4,What a steel!,Had it for almost two years with almost daily use. Still puts a nice edge on my global and my other cheap knives as well.
4,elegant and inexpensive,"Well, it's got classy Italian design, a smooth anodized body, and nice rubber grippers--there's even a bottle opener on the handle. The winged corkscrew is a perfect, timeless design--one of of the best ways to get into that dusty old bottle of pinot noir."
5,Originality shouldn't be berated,"Come on guys, this book is better than the review given above! Granted, this is for children with an above average IQ as far as the reading goes, but it is a delightful and imaginative story and the artwork is great.The author has made numerous contributions to The Oxford University Press Childrens Anthology and has written and illustrated several other books that are all delightful.Our childrens reading circle highly enjoyed this book"
1,horrible service,Did not ship for over a month. Did not return emails about the product not shipping. Horrible service. Will never buy from them again.
2,Not what I expected,The delivery took about as long as anticipated but ended up being the wrong edition of the book... Good thing I didn't spend too much for it.
2,Few insights here,"Given the author's credentials and extensive research, I really believed I'd get some insights into the secret handshake. As an executive coach, I keep up on developments. The major insight I got here was how far some people will go to play the game. That was in the anecdote of the woman who practiced lowering her voice to sound more executive-like. Other than that, not much new for me and a major disappointment of my expectation."
2,"""Publish or Perish"" obligation by PhD consultant.","Nothing new in this book. Same old tired ideas.The author is a PhD consultant, looking to bolster her consulting practice by using this book to claim she's an expert in business communications.This is just another output from the 'publish or perish' requirement for professors. These PhD's are forced to write these books with rehashed ideas, just to keep their teaching jobs, and convince a few gullible middle managers they know what they're talking about.You'll learn a lot more from ""Influence"" by R. Cialdiniand ""Play like a man, win like a woman"" by Gail Evans"
2,Helpful..But Watch Out!!!,Trust in the Lord will all your heart and lean not in your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will direct your paths. -Proverbs 3:5-7
5,This book is the key...,"To succeeding in business. If you've ever thought that there was a secret world below the surface of your office, this book will show it to you and teach you how to negotiate within it-- with terrific results. I highly recommend it."
5,good book for beginners,I recommend this book for the politically naive as it showed all the tips and tactics to get ahead in the workplace and beware of heavy handed office politics tactics.
2,Fundamentally flawed,"This is a terrible book. I don't mean that it is not well-written - it is, or that it is not a great intro to politics - it is. However, the fundamental premise of the book - that one needs to master political manoeuvring to thrive in the workplace - is flawed. There are better alternatives that are far more effective, will make you feel like and be perceived as a strong leader, and that will simply make you feel strong, healthy, and good. I suggest, for example, ""Crucial conversations"" and/or ""Seven habits""."
2,A Heavy Read Masks Little Information,"Reardon's approach to the business world in ""The Secret Handshake"" is, although intriguing, unfortunately so heavily bogged down in details and marred by a lack of clarity in writing style that distracts rather than attracts during the various nuanced analyses. This book is, perhaps, useful for teaching in academia; however, I found the approach used in a contemporary work, ""Cain and Abel at Work"", to be much shorter, punchier, and to the point. ""The Secret Handshake"" is overly insulary and tangential, with little to no real-world application. I was highly disappointed."
3,Tidbits but not much more,"This work had some interesting tidbits here and there, but I felt on the whole it was rather thin.I think the thing that disturbed me the most, is that no where is adding value to the business is mentioned. I suppose that one could argue between perceived value and real value and perhaps that is the crux of politics. However it rather rubbed me the wrong way as it seems seems terribly self serving. I have been in corporations where the politically astute do have their way, influence decisions, then move on to their next corporate challenge leaving everyone else to clean up.However, suppose that fall more into the realm of ethics rather than politics.This book might be helpful to someone who really needs the ground up basics, but don't look here for any insight into deeper political management."
5,Good but expensive,"This book is a real wonder book for any fruit lover who wants to do more than just plant fruit trees.However, I am unable to understand why the price has almost doubled in just a few months. I really wnated to give one to a friend as a gift, but now i have to rethink that.Denise"
3,WILD MANGOES,"THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WHOLE FRUIT ESPECIALLY THE ESTABLISHMENT CRETERIA, CULTIVARS AND ROOTSTOCKS, NUSERY PRACTICES, ORCHARD ESTABLISHMENT, PLANT PROTECTION, HARVEST AND POST-HARVEST HANDLING OF THE FRUIT, AND THE ECONOMY WORLD WIDE. I THINK IF I CAN GET MORE OF THIS INFORMATION I CAN BE SATISFIED ABOUT YOUR BOOK."
4,they help,"Bought these for a child size drum set to control noise and improve sound. They work majic on the midsize drums such as the snare and 10 inch tom-tom. For the floor Tom and bass drum, you will still need to use some other type of damping or install a second ring on the resonator head (This gets expensive)."
1,"A disappointment, the music is great but the vocals detract.","Musically, 10,000 Maniacs without Natalie Merchant is still 10,000 Maniacs. This new CD demonstrates the band's intelligent approach. The music is polished and some of their best. Unfortunately, Mary Ramsey, while obviously a talented musician, does not have the vocal ability to lead a band. There's a little too much vibratto, too much clarity, too much ""made for contempory easy listening radio"" in her voice. The band needs a dynamic lead vocalist, and unfortunately, they just don't have it on this CD. It is a huge disappointment."
3,"""Earth Pressed"" on.... without Natalie!","This album truly recaptures the ""magic"" that brought 10,000 maniacs to the forefront when ""In My Tribe"" was released. The lyrics, melodies, and musical style makes any long time Maniacs fan rejoice. The one component that is missing is Natalie Merchant. While Mary Ramsey does her best to deliver these great Maniacs songs, it somehow isn't believable. While I don't believe that 10,000 maniacs died when Natalie Merchant left the band, one can always hope for a reunion!!!"
1,Don't care what anyone says...,The maniacs are not the same without Natalie... Mary's voice is just too mousy and unbearable to listen to. THe music is still great... but they need a new singer!
4,This is their best album since In My Tribe.,"The Earth Pressed Flat is the best 10,000 Maniacs Album since In My Tribe. Mary Ramsey's voice sounds more integrated into the songs, and the chiming quality of their music pervades the songs. Time Turns is lovely."
5,A thing of beauty!,"At first I wasn't sure about this album. But it grew on me, sorta like the mold on the bread on top of my fridge. It has a very folksy allure, much like ""The Wishing Chair."" The band seems to be having fun and it is a real plus that Mary Ramsey plays an instrument(the viola) so beautifully. Armand John Petri produces the album with a knack of focusing on the music, letting it be natural. It is a fun album to listen to and well worth the price you pay for it and the many hours of enjoyment that you can find in it. Maniacs of all forms-ROCK ON!"
2,Disappointing,"Had high hopes for this, unfortunately they have not been met. The problem is the lack of decent material, the record feels over produced to these ears, only the cover of Sandy Denny's ""Who knows where the time goes?"" saves it from complete mediocrity."
2,This was a MAJOR disappointment!!,I was really looking forward to this CD because I love the Maniacs and especially thought the Merchant-less version was great. This CD did nothing for me. In fact it's going to the used shop so it can do nothing for someone else. Every song on this disc sounds the same. Mix it up a little guys! Maybe another Roxy Music cover is in order.
2,"Disappointing - Natalie, Help!",What a disappointment! It sounds like they replaced Natalie Merchant with Maureen McGovern. The tracks are all 'samey' and seem to lack an energy that the Maniacs used to have.
2,"Pressed Flat As A ""2 Star"" Album","Earth Pressed Flat is an interesting name for this album. Unfortunately, emotionally this album falls flat!Where are those classic 10kM themes? Why can't these lyrics involve the listener?"
4,"Merchant-less, yet still a solid buy","I originally got into 10,000 Maniacs back in 1989 and was attracted to the bands combination of excellent intrumentalists and Natalie's unique and pleasurable vocals. Mary Ramsey's vocals are not as unique, in fact, perhaps too commonplace. However, the band's songs and melodic guitars still provide the sound I adore and are capable of altering emotion. Mary's voice is not exactly bad, but the musicianship itself is enough for me to maintain a following. MJE W-S, NC"
2,whats the matter here?,"I enjoyed the last album- ""Love Among the Ruins"" and picked this effort up based on hearing the title track. The music is great, if not better than the Merchant days- (""Our time in Eden"" still my favorite CD}. The musicianship is the best ever -ala Bob Buck. I have put this CD on the shelf because of the vocals. I don't think Mary could ""belt one out"" if she had to. The lack of emotion/dynamic/power in the lead vocal wastes the fine base established by the group. Each song has the same lilting vocal as the track before. The 10K habit of doubiling the lead as opposed to using harmonies only makes things worse. These guys are far from done but they need to incorporate a lead vocal with some power."
3,It's not great nor awful,"The problem with the Maniacs is that they are not very interesting without Natalie Merchant and the problem with Natalie Merchant is that she is very dull without the Maniacs. Clearly, both parties have faltered without one and other and provide live shows that reflect this condition.This is a good but dull CD. Mary Ramsey is a fine singer but does not have any fan appeal.With Rob Buck's passing (Maniacs guitarist) it's up in the air if the band will tour. Should they do so I would only recommend seeing them if Natalie was singing.Let me be clear. I saw both Natalie and the Maniacs on their own and they are not worth seeing without one and other. Seperately, they release dull CD's and play dull concerts. Together they are fantastic!"
1,Teachers handbook of sloyd,The book I received has 42 of 216 pages that are not readable. Very unsatisfied and I would not purchase again from this company.
4,Chilling,"These stories are chilling and make you think twice about that bump in the night. Great to snuggle into the covers and watch on a cool night when there's nothing on TV. They are re-enacted as they happened, not as a movie type of thing. The only parts I don't like about these is people are always trying to ""set them free"" or run them out. Maybe they don't want to leave, they were there first!"
3,KEELY HAS THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL............,"I have always been in love with Keelys' voice. It is soo sweet. I sounds like the voice of an angel. The only reason i didn't rate this cd higher, was because of the song selection. Some of the songs offered here, are not that good. Some of the arrangements are a little weak. This is a cd that i think most people will enjoy. It will entertain you. I recommend that you buy this cd."
5,A female vocalist you have to hear to believe.,"I bought this CD pretty much by chance. But I've been completely enchanted with Keely Smith since that time. I have purchased some of her other albums, but this is by far the best. If you are going to try a Keely Smith CD, this has to be the one you buy."
5,Keely - the voice that could bring an audience to a hush,"I first saw Keely perform with her husband Louis Prima on Ed Sullivan's TV show. I was instantly curious to get a good look at the face that matched such a silky-smooth voice. Alas, black-and-white TV complete with snow foiled me on at least two occasions. However, I never forgot that voice - and once you hear it, neither will you. It is remarkable in its quality and timbre.Nelson Riddle and Billy May, as well as a few other of the great Capitol arrangers and bandleaders, provide solid and top-notch backing for a legendary performer. DON'T TAKE YOUR LOVE FROM ME, SWEET AND LOVELY, and a host of other standards, performed ballad-style, will keep you enthralled and wondering why, with all of her style, she backed out of performing for so long.And yes-the face does match the voice. Thank goodness for COLOR television!"
3,Network Security,As most Cisco books it was rather loosely written. It was a nice addition to classroom instruction though.
1,A Work In Progress,"I've had this book for years and have dusted it off on occassion to see if it or myself had become a little less obtuse with age.I'm sorry to say that it still remains a mystery to me.The author should have taken the reader through examples of his method on a step by step basis and more importantly,his book should have gone through several more edits befor it was published.It's unfortunate because perspective is a very worthwhile tool in the design process if presented in a clear and understanding way even with the prevalence of computer generated technology.In the not too distant future,I hope that someone will provide a wide and anxious audience with this much needed information in a more effective manner."
1,Highly unlikely that this product is from Wild Fish,A look at their website takes you to the company's factory in Europe. They say that the oil is made from cutting from smoked salmon...from Norwegian fish. There is NO wild atlantic fishery in Norway.How can salmon oil be from Wild Atlantic Salmon from a country that does not have a wild atlantic fishery?
4,Funny as hell,"This CD isn't that inspired by any means, but it is funny and as far as simple music goes, it's really good. I love to listen to this CD when I need to get pumped up or just get happy. I love complicated music like The Mars Volta and Reeve Carney but every once in a while I like to kick back with my Crazy Star!!"
5,Revolutionary!! (Fever),"I loved their EP and the updated ""F**k n' Spend"" on the Neptunes album ""Clones"". Then the iTunes exclusive demo track ""Switch It"" arrived and I was more pumped than ever to hear the album.And the album lives up to all my hopes. They updated all the other EP tracks in addition to ""F**k n' Spend"" so it totally feels like an all new album. Kinda. Hehe. This album is a refreshing face lift to the rock genre as a whole the way Spymob and Letter Kills were (and are).It'll be the best $10 you spend!"
1,hissy fit for losers,"What a load of crap. And you wonder why nobody like you!?Ani Difranco is waaaaay funnier!!!!Try serious self-inspection. Crass, rude, vulger, sloppy is not a style. I quit ....watta waste of valuable time. That's 12 seconds I'll never get back."
5,Simply great knives,"I have been using Global knives for about 12 years and love them all. Just picked up the G-9 Bread Knife and it is top quality like the others I have. If the price is in your budget I would recommend these for the quality, balance and the styling."
5,Global Knives are the beset,"I have tried a wide variety of knives out there. I quickly learned that Japanese knives are the way to go. After trying several Japanese brands, Global really stood out. I would recommend not only this knife but any Global knife to anyone looking for a quality knife."
3,"Decent Device, Attrocious Support","This device works well. After a couple of months, it suffered a disk problem, which is completely understandable. Throughout the repair, I was required to contact tech support 7 times for various issues.I have _never_ been able to reach anyone at Buffalo tech support in less than 1 hour (over 7 calls, that's almost a workday), and on one occasion it was an hour and a half."
1,Not reliable!,"My second one died yesterday after I turned it off before a power failure. After 4 hours with tech support, they are replacing it again. Data probably gone. It was a month old which is a month longer than the first one lasted. The replacement is going on e-bay as I can't possibly rely on it and they are impossible for tech support to fix. Get something else."
1,ZERO STAR NOT ALLOWED,"I am on the phone with Buffalo right now. If a Buffalo device is out of warrantee, it is a boat anchor. They give lifetime support, but will not sell you any parts. If your hard drive controller fails you can not buy a replacement. Buffalo says you are on your own good luck? Call Buffalo at 800-456-9799 to confirm. I still can not believe when the unit fails, with good drives, you lose your data or need to learn Unix/Linux and figure out how the data is stored. What's the point of buying it in the first place? Great support, but no option to BUY replacement parts. What good is support if you can not order and pay for the parts needed to fix it."
2,No NFS support makes NAS a dumb cluck,"See my review for the 2TB version of this product. In a nutshell - this NAS product doesn't support NFS, which makes it unsuitable for many NAS environments including Unix (although you can limp along with Linux SMB support) and VMware.Plus it's overpriced. Look at the Promise SmartStor alternative (NetGear ReadyNAS NV+ is almost 2x expensive and is less capable than Promise - ATA-150 instead of ATA-300)."
1,Buffalo Support - Grade = F,"Bought a TeraStation Pro unit. Had problems within a couple of months - constant 15 hour long rebuilds of the RAID - during which the unit was useless. RMA process was not completed because Buffalo never sent the key to open the unit. Over time, the unit failed to write more than a few files at a time - requiring rebooting the unit - so it could not be used as a backup anymore. Finally a drive failed. Western Digital said there was no warranty because it was an OEM drive. Buffalo says the warranty was only 1 year. So I am the fool who purchased an expensive backup device that was only warranted for a year! Somehow, backup security that is only good for a year doesn't seem very comforting. And Buffalo was adamant that they were sorry I now owned a ""brick"" but there was nothing they could do about it. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware!,I own 2 TeraStation Pro's. A 1TB and a 4TB. They do not work as advertised. Buffalo Tech support does not keep promises. The marketing and manuals for the product appear to be fraudulent. This is a company to avoid!
3,"Adequate, but lacking something...","Well, it's not bad...but the arrangements seem to be trying to prove something that is unclear. Take for example the very catchy #2 (Northern Dances) and #11 (Grey Eyes)...pretty much the same melody with the same fretless bass line and rhythm, furthermore #7 (Through the Orchard) which sounds like something that Rimsky-Korsakov set in one of his pieces but in an arrangement that left me with a headache. Easter (#5), in spite of the review, isn't particularly 'rapping' at all, but a highly melodic spoken-song with what sounds like a droneless bagpipe...really catchy in this arrangement. Though there are 12 songs, the promo material in the cd case only lists 11 songs, and in spite of my knowledge of the Russian language, I can't understand the muddled lyrics of ""Poppy"".Basically, think of Marta Sebastyen's band Muzsikas without oomph, with what sounds a litle like Klezmer, and R&B; bits thrown in for some reason."
3,this music is good.,"I very much enjoyed this compact disk. i found this while in America, however,this must be an american style band, as nobodyI know in Minsk or Moscow for that matter has ever heard of this group. I do like the different types of musical insturments, but it becomes disjointed at times and the sound can become muddled."
5,Great book for weekend reading,I thought this book was a real page turner. It was hard to put down once I started reading it. The theme was original with a surprise ending. The characters and scenes were very descriptive and colorful. The Authors style of writing and some of his personal insites were thought provoking and interesting. I would recommend this book to any adult.
4,Immediate Motivation,"This book offers a lot of motivation, because besides inviting you to practice what you have read already, the changes of people's attitude they can also be seen that surrounds you as well as in yourself immediately."
4,Not disappointed,"I bought this album and The Best having heard DAB on the Cafe del Mar series. There are a lot of artists displaying their wares in the CdM gallery, so a song has to really stand out for me to consider following it up. 'Pure Joy' caught my attention on CdM 13, and later I heard, and saw the video to The Call' on You Tube. I was still hesitant about ordering these disks, as so many bands now are inconsistent in both style & quality; there were no samples to listen to; and no one had previously reviewed either of these albums.My concern proved unnecessary. For the most part consistently good songs evocative of those dreamy Ibiza evenings sought on the CdM albums. If you have enjoyed DABs offerings on CdM, chances are you'll enjoy these two albums.Best 2, by the way, is, in my opinion, the better of the two releases so far."
4,Very good,"It was probably the first ELT's album recorded after the departure of keyboard genius Mitsuru Igarashi. I'm a die-hard ELT's fan but I confess they were so much exciting in their previous albums, when they were a trio instead of a duo.This one has highs and lows, sometimes lacks in energy and also in consistency.Probably the only energic and exciting song similar to the previous works is the track #2, ""Jirenma"", which is obviously my favorite of this album.I like ""No limit"", too.But the most known songs of this one are the low-speeded ""Graceful world"", ""Ai no kakera"" and ""Fragile"".Not a bad album because they are incredible musicians. I truly think any Every Little Thing's album audience is a delightful experience, but I like them most when they increase speed and energy."
5,Great Starter Yanagiba!,"I recently began working in a Sushi Bar, where I was required to invest in my own knives. I wanted a good knife but didn't want to pay an exorbitant amount. Some Yanagiba and other sushi knives can cost upwards of $1000 a piece! I purchased this 10.5"" Bunmei Yanagiba Knife and have found it exceeded my expectations. The blade is constantly exposed to moisture from fish, vegetables, fruit, and cleaning, and is rust free thus far. It's easy to care for, and holds a great edge.I use this yanagiba mainly for slicing sashimi and sushi rolls. It cuts effortlessly through most things and the grip is comfortable, even when my hands are wet. As a bonus it arrived with a mean factory edge! I didn't even have to pre-sharpen it and haven't had to sharpen it once after a week of moderate to heavy use. Highly recommended for starters who've never worked with Japanese cutlery before."
4,Handle with Care!!,"Extreme caution advised! These really are RAZOR sharp. I sell knives at Williams-Sonoma and I have cut myself on the Bunmei twice already. I take my job very seriously and am extremely careful when handling them, but still got cut. These are for pros, sushi chefs and those used to the blade on a Japanese knife. Very dangerous in the wrong hands. Very, very good choice if you really do want to precisely slice a lot of fish."
1,handle looks cheap,the handle looks very cheap. Not sure if it was the bamboo/wood used or the paint. You could even see glue between it and the blade. We returned the knife.
1,Junk,"Picked up this book in the clearance bin at a technical bookstore close to my work place for Five Dollars. I thought I had an incredible bargain in my hands until I read the book. What a piece of trash! I do a lot of Object oriented coding with Powerbuilder on WindowsNT4.0. I was interested in the design patterns & OO programming techniques that the authors say that they are covering in the book in the preface. I have already read the Patterns book by Erich Gamma/John Vlissides and I was interested in how the authors might have applied those techniques with PowerBuilder. It was a major disappointment for me when I discovered that the authors had no clue of OO programming and a very bad understanding of Patterns in particular. They seem to know enough about Powerbuilder, but they are totally ignorant of OOP and patterns.I spent only five dollars to buy this book but still I feel ripped off. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,One of the best OO-based advanced PB5 books,"For advanced programmers who understand OO concepts. Covers advanced features of the Enterprise version including C++ class objects and the new PFC, user objects, OLE Automation, OCX/ActiveX, component-based design using Design Patterns. Really explains PowerBuilder's object oriented capabilities"
1,unwatchable,"There's usually a reason for a DVD being this cheap: it's a public domain title mastered from a really old, really poor quality VHS transfer. I can't comment on the value of the movie itself because the disk is so unwatchable I couldn't sit through the whole thing. I'd have given it zero stars except Amazon requires at least one."
1,Interminable,"I bought the book because of the glowing reviews on the outside cover, all from reputable sources. I had to question if the reviewers read the same story as I. The book seemed ENDLESS at times, with the author droning on with meaningless drivel. The reader develops no connection to the characters. Save yourself for a more worthy tale."
5,One of the Best,I loved this luminous book. Doerr's writing is a gift and his story is like a prayer. His characters became welcome players in my dreams. The quiet beauty of this book will haunt me for a long time. I am grateful for the great and small gifts of About Grace. I am eager for more from this brilliant author.
1,Liked this book,"Good writing and descriptive phrases. Kept my interest and liked the underlying themes of water, time and decisions we make in our lives."
5,A Family Favorite,"My tween daughter loves this show. And, I must admit, so do I. It may not be the most sophiticated humor, but it's great when we can find a show that keeps us both entertained. And, that is the key word - entertainment. This is not definitely your ABC afterschool special! It's just grown up enough for my 10 year old girl but I never have to worry about something being inappropriate."
5,Perfect for all Ages,"iCarly Season 1 is an amazing show that pulls you in from the very first episode. iCarly does a wonderful job of promoting a technological and social media world in the right way, without any of the darkside. Carly, Sam, Freddie, and Carly's brother Spencer create a fun and exciting world centering on their weekly webshow.One of the best things about this show is the use of imagination. Who would have thought 13 year olds would have the know how and determination to create their own webshow, focusing on the fun things of life.This is a perfect show for all ages, not just children and teens, even adults! If you want to find yourself smiling, laughing and enjoying yourself, watch Season 1 of iCarly!"
5,ICARLY IS AH-AWESOME!! MUST WATCH!!,MUST WATCH!! BUY SEASON 2 TO!!! I REALLY HOPE THEIR IS A SESASON 3!
2,Not Exactly,"I don't mean to insult people, but I am not exactly the biggest fan of ""iCarly"" in the world. The comedy genre is composed mostly of bland puns, and the gags can grow repetitive. Albeit a lot of jokes in this series are the sort of humor that usually would make me chuckle, for some reason I just do not laugh about them. There are a few episodes that I like, but normally I don't watch this program very often. A lot of people may think differently, and it is fine with me if you like this series, but I just am not exactly fond of it. Sometimes I do snicker at a few jokes, but not always."
2,"""OMG""","Welcome to Seattle Washington.Welcome to big fancy apartments with personal elevators.Meet Carly who lives eit her older brother Spencer(a quirky artist).Down the hall is Freddie (who btw has a major chrush on Carly).Then there's Sam the super loud,wild, and a bit mean one. She's a food fan as well.Put all these people together and do a webcast. Have Carly be the main host along with Sam. Let Freddie do the tech stuff. Voila! iCarly.If you like seaon one you will probably like the other seasons. but if you're like me and only find the show mildly amusing...you might get burnt out after Carly or Sam or Freddie or anyone goes ""OMG"" for the thousandth time. Or you might get tired of Sam going to the refridgerator or ""random dancing"" or whatever.Try season one because it's a great introduction to the series and explains a lot.Sidenote: all the families have one caregiver and one or two siblings mid school aged or older. That's a bit odd."
4,"Good show, great support","I like the show. Miranda Cosgrove is not a very strong actor, but the show is saved by her supporting cast. Nathan Kress and Jennette Mcurdy are perfect as her dueling sidekicks, their interaction gives spice to the show, and their comedic timing is spot-on. Jerry Traynor is also perfect as the happily psychotic big brother.iCarly seems to be designed to showcase the great talents of the three supporting actors, with Miranda added for name recognition.This DVD set is well worth buying, the show is funny and innocent, suitable for families.I only gave it four stars because Mirand Cosgrove drags it down a notch."
