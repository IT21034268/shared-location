1,Big budget unrealsitic tripe,This film is garbage. Nicholas Cage and his men go around killing about a million Japanese and barely get a scratch in the process. An insult to the real fighting in the Pacific.
2,"interesting story but poor screenplay, CGI and acting","This movie is a disappointment. Cage does his part pretty well, but most others seem unnatural characters, it all seems a bit too fake. Too many episodes are beyond the limits of credibility. CGI (computer generated imagery) is pretty ridiculous, worse than a first generation videogame, it would have been acceptable in the 1980s but not twenty years later.The merit of the film, nonetheless, is to have publicised a little known aspect of the Pacific War, and it is a tribute to the valor of the Navajo."
5,Under-rated.,"This is a very under-rated movie and the subject of the film is long overdue. Our Native Americans are shown as modern day citizens and their exceptional contribution to our present day freedoms. They deserve our respect and reverence as much as any soldier, considering all the betrayals Native Americans have endured at our hands.Very realistic, revealing and deserving of watching; has a wide range of characters beyond the Windtalkers, showing the realities of life in the armed forces.Graphic and not for the young, this is a very adult movie, though no one should have to witness such realities of war.Well written, well acted, well-filmed, etc. I don't know why it didn't get more recognition and accolades when it first came out.*Highly Recommend"
1,Cage + Woo = Crap,This movie should have been good. But of course you have over acting king of crap Nicholas Cage and he is directed by slow mo dove guy John Woo. I like the idea of the movie. It should have been and could have been much better but it gets a one star from me cause the first time I watched it I thought it was awful. I have went back several times to give it another chance and it is just as bad. This movie sucked.
2,A Major Disappointment,"There's no doubt that John Woo is a gifted action director, but even the best directors can lose their touch, and that (and a weak script combined with patchy acting) is what drags ""Windtalkers"" down. The contribution and courage of the Navajo windtalkers cannot be underestimated, but Woo's pointess violence and one-dimensional characters reduce their legacy to a shallow afterthought. The film plods along from one set piece of choreographed action to another with only nominal attention given to character development and purposeful plotting. Euphemisms aside, this film is a mess despite a strong performance from Nicholas Cage, whose acting stands well above that of his costars. The true violence in this plodding piece is not the action sequences but in the ""violence"" done to the legacy of the Windtalkers. They and the Navajo people deserve a better tribute that this mindless, trite rubbish."
3,One ironic and significant line,"Not a bad movie but not a great one either. Nicholas Cage was totally over the top as Hollywood demands. Adam Beach was handsome of course, but with only three facial expressions - grimace, smile and grimace.The most significant line in the whole movie, about the Japanese on Saipan, was set in the briefing room in the presence of the two Native American codetalkers, ""It's their country and we're gonna take it from em"", which was acknowledged by the cheering soldiers.The sickening Irony was not lost on me. I wonder if anyone else noticed?"
4,Pretty Good Movie,"This was a good movie, a little gorey. It was good to see Indians in a movie where they were not being hunted by cowboys. There is a lot of action, and what happens if you just follow orders and don't use your own head to save yourself and your troops. It is also about learning about yourself and courage. There is also a man that learns that rasism is wrong and grows up."
1,Disappointed!,"Like many of the reviewers here, I did not like this movie. When the Navajo Code was declassified, I was eager to learn more about these unsung heroes of WWII. When this movie came out, I was just as eager to see it but when I finally did, I didn't even finish watching it. I was so disgusted about how the movie was advertised to be about the Navajo, but instead it concentrated on the two ""stars"" of the movie.Sure the movie could have been good if it weren't for the lopsided advertising."
1,Warning: This movie is NOT what it claims to be,This movie hyped itself to feature the efforts of the Navajo indians during WWII and the usage of their language as code. Less than 10% of this movie is actually about the Navajo indians' contribution to the Pacific War effort and mostly about the Nicolas Cage character and his problems. I was very disappointed.
1,Napoleonic soliders in WWII garb,"You're in your trench and you see the enemy coming -what do you do? In this movie, you always stand up so the enemy has a better shot. Because of this, the battle scenes look like Napoleonic battles with the solidiers in WWII garb. The movie shows both sides to be equally stupid - immediately giving up any cover when the enemy is spotted. The inane battle scenes, plastic emotions of the actors, and the portrayal of the solidiers of both sides as dumb grunts makes it easily 1-star."
1,windtalkers,"if there were an award for the worst pictures of 2002, i would nominate this. this movie managed to take a potentially good story and make a mishmash of utter nonsense out of it. nicholas cage's emotions run the full gamut from very angry to very, very angry with absolutely nothing in between or at either end. if one is fond of gruatuitous violence this is the movie for you. i quit watching at the completely improbable scene of the navajo, whom cage was to be shepherding, dressing in a japanese uniform and ""pretending"" he had captured cage. this only served to allow more staged violence. and, by the way, i noted the deciduous trees on ""saipan"" exhibiting their fall colors??? where was this thing filmed? numerous grade b saturday morning cowboy movies were more believable."
1,Don't watch this movie!!,"The acting was subpar at best and the ""plot"" was disconnected and random. The historical accuracy was in serious question.You are supposed to feel for certain marines when they die but you hadn't even been told thier names yet!!!Overall this movie rambles on with no real direction or purpose, the fight sceens are embarrising and the ending anti-climactic.A good idea ruined!"
1,Complete [bad],"This is one of the biggest waste of film I have ever watched. The acting is horrible. The action is boring, repetitive, senseless. The plot and dialogue are thin. The characters are one dimensional. The movie is predictable. Go outside, take a walk, play with your kids, ... Any activity is a better use of your time."
1,Waiting for the misery to end,"I don't know much about what the code talkes did during the war but I find it hard to believe if they were so valuable that they would be on the front lines calling in artillery. Maybe massive troop movements, battle plans, or enemy movements but not simple things like that. Also I got sick of old Nick firig five shots only to watch five dead enemy soldiers fall to the ground. I also didn't know soldiers had no fear of enemy fire and rarely took cover. Maybe it was because the japenese just came screaming at the marines instead of firing at them. I could tell this movie would be awful wthin the first 30 seconds and I was right."
1,horrific,"I had this. I threw it away. That's how bad it is. It's entertaining, well choreographed, but it's just plain awful. Soldiers cluster up, people are running everywhere screaming and firing wildly, there was clearly almost no consultation from a military historian or combat specialist.....or one of any worth.the movie is garbage! terrible. it's a shame to waste the audience's time with a poker faced so-called ""actor"" such as nick coppola and not try to actually develop a story around the native american radio-men OR the actual events in Saipan!!John Woo's DP makes a beautiful movie, some battle scenes are huge and awesome in their scope, but there is no redeeming content, no reason to watch the movie. it's a mindless running-screaming-shooting movie, with little historical basis.Do NOT give MGM anything for this poor effort!"
2,Want to get that six-pack without actually exercising?,"***PROS***- Good storyThat's it. After two minutes of 'CHAAAAAARGE!!!!!', excuse me, *ahem*, ""realistic Woo, er, war scenes"", I had to actually stop the tape because I couldn't breathe, I was laughing SO hard! While this does save this film from the dreaded one-star rating, because I morbidly appreciate 'so-bad-it's-hilarious' filmmaking as much as the next guy, it doesn't save this movie from being a complete and utter failure. You remember those annoying scenes that whispered ""Woo-was-here"" from Face/Off? Well, those Woo-scenes plague this film pretty much from start to finish.Want to watch a GOOD Woo film? Watch Face/Off instead."
2,A disappointment,"I felt that this movie left alot to be desired; at least from me. As a history of World War II buff, I thought that I would learn lots more about the code, the people who developed it and used it as well as the traditions behind it. The movie was lacking in all of those areas. While there was some good social commentary about prejudice toward Native Americans, I felt that this problem as well as their important contribution to the war effort were grossly understated. What the film did not lack was blood, guts, and pyrotechnics. While I understand that war is certainly not pretty, we all all seen that kind of thing before in other films. If you like that sort of thing, this is the movie for you. On the other hand, The Windtalkers had the opportunity to illuminate the contribution of a proud, heroic and patriotic people. For this viewer, they blew it."
2,reduced to a sidebar,this is a noisy & ghoulish war film with a sidebar on the Navajo Code Talkers - while two Navajo are frequently on the screen - code talking barely is - and in one of the climactic moments - English is all that is requiredsomeone took the old story of a guilt-ridden solder - and copy-n-pasted the code talkers into it - then added plenty of politically correct rhetoric - and set it loose on the paying publicthe code talkers deserved something that focused on them - and less on some soldier whose story is separate from theirsbased on this film - i don't know why the Americans didn't just walk to Japan - they hit every enemy soldier they shot at - but the Japanese could only splatter the ground with bullets
2,good battles but doesnt survive the fight,"Nicolas Cage(Snake Eyes, Vampire's Kiss), Christian Slater(Pup Up The Volume, Heathers), Adam Beach(Joe Dirt, Smoke Signals), Noah Emmerich(The Truan Show, Monument Ave.) and Mark Ruffalo(The Last Castle, xx/yy) star in WindTalkers, which really means some Native American thing about the soldiers who were Native American....being that Adam Beach is in this one. good battle sequences makes this good for some time but the dramatic side becomes wooden and we dont seem to care about Cage or Beach or anyone after awhile..note: Slater gets beheaded in this one..ouch"
2,Hollywood,"How disappointing! I expected the true story of the Windtalkers, and what I saw was a war movie with a white guy as the hero. Did the Nicholas Cage character even exist? Some of the fight scenes could have been shortened in order to give the background of the Navaho, how they were put into Indian schools as children and punished if they spoke their own language, how they struggled with whether or not to become code talkers, how they set up the code, and their life after the war. Some day someone should make a movie about the Windtalkers."
1,Pointless,"To have taken such a fascinating story and turned it into such a piece of blancmange is sheer artistic incompetence. Windtalkers is a prime example of a director with no knowledge of - or indeed interest in - the realities of combat. At no point in the film is there even a suggestion that Wu was concerned about accuracy. The characters are cliched, the sets are straight out of the 1950s, the action is stilted and unconvincing. Rather than a *rating of 1-5, there should be a set of minus ratings for this film. Windtalkers is embarrasingly bad."
2,ful of stereotypes!,It is a well done typicall Hollywood movie but I have seen all this so many times. Everything is so predictable. The movie with such great actors as Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater doesn't have any material for them to work with. I was shocked that such inventive director as John Woo could make such lame movie. Not recommended.
2,"Horrible movie as ""Pearl Harbor""","There is only two suggestions to the director of the movie: 1) Stop using the SLOW-MOTION again, will you?! It's so bothering and disturbing just as the non-stop, totally unrelated background music playing on with those movies. 2) Is there any way that you could direct any movie that wouldn't have to waste so much dynamite and so many explosions? By watching the movies that you directed I only found out that there is no progress or improvment in the directing so far since those HongKong days but over-used old old montage techniques. The slow-motion frames on the screen and those explosions are only proofs that how bad a director would be and could reach. The costs of dynamite and stuntmen could be better used in making a better movie with better script and better casting. This time, there is no generation gap between me and my 25 & 15 years old sons, We all agreed that this movie ... big time."
3,A BARE DVD PACKAGE!,"""Windtalkers"" looks great and sounds awesome in digital form! But the DVD has almost no bonus material on it!Special Features:""Windtalkers"" Teaser Trailer""Windtalkers"" Theatrical Trailer""Die Another Day"" Teaser Trailer""007"" DVD Collection Trailer""Hart's War"" DVD Trailer""Windtalkers"" Soundtrack Promo SpotRecommendations from MGM StudiosWidescreen (2.40:1) and Fullscreen FormatsClosed CaptioningSubtitlesI thought flops always got bigger DVD releases! But this one, although it's a great film, proved me wrong!Movie Grade: A+DVD Grade: C+"
4,historical pictures,"I really liked this movie and Nicolas Cage does a wondeful job starring as a battle scarred Sergeant recruited to protect a Navajo ""codetalker"" from falling into Japanese hands during the Saipan battle of 1945. The only problem I had with this movie is that they didn't show enough of the Navajo telling the coordinates during major battles, but it's still a pretty good war flick."
5,Taught me a lot about history,"I have read lots of the reviews from other customers, and all I have to say is, if you can't spell, how can you even rate a movie?I like this movie because it tells me about a time in history that I knew nothing about. It gives credit where credit is due, to my Native American brothers who were heroes once again.I was very pleased with the cast and thought they did an excellent job in the portrayal of the characters they played.Also, have you ever directed a movie? It is a difficult job, and should not be criticized unless you have done a better job in your life.And all I have to say is Adam Beach you rule! I would like to see him in more movies."
2,"Nice Cinematography, but poor acting and unrealistic battle","I found this movie to be a major disappointment. The acting was terrible even by Nicolas Cage. The guy who played Ben Yahzee did a pretty good acting job, though.The battle scenes were just terrible. The Japanese apparently couldn't hit the side of a barn while Cage takes out 3 standing out in the open from 75 yards with a hand gun. Many of the Japanese soldiers just ran up to get stabbed or shot. The bombs were too fiery; not realistic and I know as a former Artillery Officer. The bit where Yahzee and Enders trick the Japanese into thinking Enders is a prisoner; get real. A total joke.On a bright note, I thought the cinematography, especially of the Arizona Desert with the bluffs was awesome. I'm glad that the Navajo were given credit for their service in WWII. It's just too bad that it couldn't have been a better movie."
1,Vomit,"I couldn't be more disgusted. a single well-trained soldier would survive just fine. Apparently someone working on the film told all the actors to charge and never take cover. The military advisor to this film must be as frustrated as myself. John Woo has really fallen far. Windtalkers, Face Off and Mission Impossible II don't even come close to his more famous HK films made with Chow Yun Fat. They're contrived, but not enjoyable. Woo has gone too far. This movie makes films like Battle of the Bulge or Anzio look GOOD in comparison!!"
2,Disapointing,I Thought I was going to watch a movie with some historical accuracy with some dramatic flare added for content. Instead I watched an over acted over dramatized movie with little or no entertainment value. Nicolas Cage Was the star in this film and had one of the worst performances I've ever seen. If it had been billed a an action movie maybe it would have been better but since we were told it had some historical accuracy I was quite disappointed with the rambo style acting he added to this movie. I will admit that the script he was working with did not give him much room for improvment.
1,Don't waste your time,"Bad movie. I was expecting a greater focus on the role of the Navaho code, instead it's about a shell-shocked Nic Cage coming to terms with his personal demons. A bright spot: Adam Beach does some fine acting. Looking for a good war flick, check out Black Hawk Down, We Were Soliders, Saving Private Ryan, and the soon to be released ""Band of Brothers."" These films are much more believable."
1,Worst WW11 movie ever made!,"I love world war 2 movies and this one is by far the worst. I really wanted to see this movie when it first came out, but then after i saw it i almost died. Trust me, if you have never seen this movie dont see it. Dont waste your time watching this. IF you want to buy a good world war 2 movie then wait and buy the band of brothers set. It is much better."
5,Very nice!,"This CD is among the best chillout/trance music that I have. Wonderful stuff to sip a cup of coffee to and relax. Very moody, goes in lots of colorful places yet isn't too intrusive. I highly recommend it!"
1,Not very good.,"While the software installed very easily, the product did not work very well. When displaying channels, I never got a whole picture in the entire window. At first I thought it was just the tuner, but when trying to use the video in, the picture was just as horrible. I find this product to be unusable. Get the Hauppauge instead."
4,Beau Brummels - 'Introducing The.....' (Sundazed),"'Introducing...' was the band's first lp as it USUALLY is great to always here a band's(any band's)for that matter very first effort.Originally released in 1965.Two bonus tracks are added on.It's been SO long since I've heard any music from the San Francisco five piece.Beau Brummels had managed to benefit from creating their own brand of harmless good-natured laid back pop.Heck,I think my own parents would even get something out of this reissue.The Brummels have much to offer the listener in the way of employing somewhat rich melodies and soaring harmonies in the making of their music.Key tracks include ""Laugh,Laugh"",""Just A Little"",""Oh Lonesome Me"" and the rocking ""That's If You Want Me"".Should appeal to fans of the Byrds,Lovin' Spoonful,the Monkees,Grass Roots and the Searchers."
4,Refreshing sunshine pop,"A friend of mine offered me this album. Since I really am into vocal harmonies, he thought I'd be quite enthused by this record. And boy was he right!Nothing too serious on this album, though, the 12 tracks are unoriginal light-hearted poppy tracks, maybe not quite as good as the Hollies since the harmonies may sound a little shaky at times.But all in all, you won't be disappointed. The bonus tracks are strong material. ''Good Time Music', 'Gentle Wanderin' Ways' and 'Fine With Me' are all killers.Buy it before it goes out of print!"
5,Ron Elliott is......,......one of music's under-rated composers. The group he and Sal put together really got the ball rollin' for a softer-country type of rock. In 1965 that's quite a river to cross!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,About the (in)famous black dragon Khisanth,The story is indeed about the period of time between the awakening of the black dragon Khisanth and the moment in which she is banished to protect the Crystal Staff. It is quite a stupid book if you haven't read any of the others (by Weis and Hickman).One annoying part of the book is the dragon's ability to shapechange in a non magical way. I find this incredulous to believe.
3,From a different perspective indeed!,"Its too bad this couldn't have been written before the Chronicles. This book made Khisanth out to be a much worthier opponent for the Companions than the Chronicles did.As it is, this was still a great book. Once again, the Dragonlance saga proves its ok to like the bad guys."
2,Incomplete,"Books ignores many places in Arizona. Nothing on Lake Havasu, Kingman, Oatman, Yuma, ShowLow, Pinetop, Payson, Mogollon Rim and nothing on cover of book, front or back, indicates it selectively covers state."
1,Useless,In my eyes the book is absolutely useless. It is more than superficial as far as sightseeing is concerned. You certainly need another guide to check out which attractions are worth a visit and what exactely is offered. The best information is on hotels and restaurants and you can get these (and better one) the web. Not worth the relatively high price
3,Arizona for Learners,"I love this book and have learned many things, although it is more for a traveler than I. I haven't left home yet. :) Good book. Don't like the Dummies title. Thanks, Elizabeth A Stratton"
2,"even for this tiny price,not worth my while","Not well written,did not grab me and I knew everything in advance. No suspense,no good plot 2 tiny stars ** from me"
2,Needs proof reading,Bought this based on the amazon reviews and it will be one of the few books that I will leave unfinished. It appears that no one proofread it and the errors are too distracting. Too many good books await me to spend more time with this one.
2,Supplied old version book,"I had ordered 2nd edition of the book after verifying the ISBN on the Amazon site. The book I received was 1st edition and has a different ISBN number. When I contacted seller, he asked me to return the book. Considering the shipping cost (which is over 50% of book price), I decided not to return the book. But I feel cheated by the seller and shopping at Amazon site."
2,Prodject Management,"I wasn't very happy with this text book. For topics discussed, I found more well written, clearer, and entertaining information for free via Google for free. The book was originally sold with a CD, which probably costs more than a download. however, because I bought the book for used, of course the CD was missing.The publisher would have a better product to sell if a download section were included on the web site."
4,Good Trasaction,"I think its a good book. I got it for a course, so I'm stil starting on it. Well organized.Supplier's service was very good!"
3,Okay but flimsy,I asked for this as a gift. I was surprised at how flimsy and lightweight it is. I'm not sure how it won't blow away. The directions are horrible so I still haven't put it together. It may be worth it to pay a little more to get something more sturdy.
1,Juwel Cold Frames - poor quality,We purchased the cold frame and extension. It is poorly made and could not stand up to one year in Boise Idaho. Condensation and dust built up in the doors making them dirty. Side parts cracked form the stress the poorly engineered brackets put on them. We had to disassemble and reassemble the whole cold frame because the sides kept pulling apart.We contacted Juwel but they would not help us. We have returned ours to the seller for refund.Overall score D-. Recommendation - do not buy.
3,Chinese English Electronic Speaking Dictionary MD7100,"This produce seemed helpful from the advertisement. It has a lot of nice features. The problem I have with it is this product seems to cater to the Chinese speaking population only and not the English speaking population as there is no instructions in English. There's also no Cantonese speaking voice, just English and Mandarin. Difficult to use without an English langauge instruction. The keyboard has too many Chinese characters and should have more English characters to help the English speaking users. I purchased this product with the intention that this device will help me communicate when I visit Hong Kong and China."
4,Good Product received in time,Good Product received in time very happy with the kit boot.fast to fix it and the grease in very good.
5,WOW!!,"This CD captures Nina Storey performing live. The energy and passion is heard in every song. ""9/10"" and ""LEFT"" are my favorite tracks. Nina is a wonderful songwriter as well as an incredible singer."
1,The band outperforms the star ....................,"I like the band, they're better than she is. She is pretentious, but they rock, even though they're not well recorded.She has a good voice, but wastes it."
5,Obsession or Love,"THE IVORY GRIN demonstrates the creative power of Ross MacDonald. Lew Archer is hired to find a mysterious young woman by an equally mysterious older woman. Soon after Archer finds her in a sleazy motel the young woman is murdered and an innocent young man flees the scene. The police want a quick wrap up to a crime, which they see as love gone wrong.For Archer there are too many loose threads, which unravel to no end. This novel written in 1952 still has the power to enthrall sixty years later. Detective fiction at its classic best.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
4,"""You can't stand the human idea.""","The Ivory Grin (also published under the title Marked for Murder) was the fourth Lew Archer novel and was released in 1952. It's classic hard-boiled territory-- a dubious case, a lying client, a need for cash, and a vicious murder. Lew Archer gets a taste what men will do for love in a town where it seems like anything goes.Macdonald is one of my favorite of the hard-boiled writers, and The Ivory Grin is an exceptionally good example of the Archer books. It may not stack up against the absolute best in the series (so far, my favorite is the 1st-- The Moving Target) but is still a fine fine book.Recommended. Particularly for fans of the genre."
4,First rate Detective Mystery Lew Archer,I had heard alot about his books. Finally read the CHILL. It was just ok. But the IVORY GRIN is excellent. Highly recommend it.
2,Not Impressive,"Of course, the title tells one that this book is not long on quantity, but implies that it's very high on quality. Not true IMHO. I found only 2 or 3 really good ones and a few marginal ones. The best included:#322: I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody. Bill Cosby#498: Our national flower is the concrete cloverleaf. Lewis Mumford"
5,Excellent,I had rented it from the library and liked it so much that I bought it. I have tried multiple Qi Gong videos for use in my Eastern Massage class and this is by far the best. The students really related to it and they could more readily feel the energy which was important in learning to feel the meridians and do acupressure as well as marma points.
5,Feel Better Fast!!,"QiGong sounds so wierd (it's pronounced CHEE-GUNG), but here in my little spa town, it's more popular than yoga. I love it because I don't have to change into workout clothes or lie down on the floor, but the effects are immediate -- something about the breathing and the movement together are instantly revitalizing. And it's much easier to learn than Tai Chi!This program is my favorite because of the two practices: one hot and one cool. The FIRE program is great when I'm feeling sad or low on energy, or like I might be getting a cold. The WATER program is great for calming down if I'm angry or stressed, or if I can't sleep. Matthew's teaching is detailed and poetic, and the scenery is almost as healing as the practice!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,happy seniors,My husband & I are senior citizens. I am 74 & overweight. He is in good condition. We have been doing this for a month and both can feel the difference in energy & balance. Matthew does a wonderful job of explaination and has a pleasant soothing voice. The 40 minutes are over with before you know it. We wish he would have another one out just for a change in the routines.We like the fire workout the best. I find myself unconciously doing the breathing and postures in my daily chores. Thank You Matthew!
3,BORING,"The movements are great but the narative is so BORING. It's slow and without any energy...like a bad lecture. The people doing the exercise don't look happy joyful or at peace. This dvd is more focused on exercise not flow. There is a pause between every movement. I kept finding myself wanting this to be over. Other qi gong masters, know how to flow right along and make you enjoy the movements and find joy. Won't buy another one by Cohen"
1,Not for me I guess,"First the video shown with the product description is deceptive, that's not Qi Gong. The two sets of exercises are not very interesting in my opinion, focusing mostly on chi pulsing, chi movement. I'm not a 'believer' in that but enjoy tai chi and yoga as forms of exercise for strength, flexibility and balance. Qi Gong apparently doesn't go there if this DVD is representative. DVD broke 2nd time I tried to take it out of the case, not sorry actually. Low rating for what I consider to be false advertising with that little video clip."
3,Fell short of expectations,Based on other's reviews I expected a bit more from this DVD. I took a class and really liked Qi Gong. I guess doing a DVD is just not the same as taking a class in person. I will try a DVD with a different instructor and see if I like it any better.
2,it doesnt work,"i tried the techniques didnt really work, its not the dvd its the Qi gong the dvd is really good its got alot"
5,Qi Gong,As a massage therapist I was teaching Eastern Massage at one of the schools here. I was looking at the library for a stretch video for the class when I came across this gem. We all love the movements and how we felt afterward. After that I just had to have a copy for home! My husband and I both love it and that gives us another way to spend time together. I love Matthew Cohen's narration of the movements as well as the exercises themselves.
5,Very pleased with my first Qi Gong DVD,"I have been wanting to learn Qi Gong for awhile and had trouble picking the one I wanted. I wanted something easy enough for a beginner with good intruction, and with an actual routine I could follow, not just showing the individual practices.I am very pleased with this DVD. It is exactly what I wanted. I love that it has two different routines. One (fire) is a little more strenuous - my thigh muscles hurt the next day! But it is invigorating and definitely feels good. I love the water routine the most, it is very flowing and gentle. I feel very centered and relaxed afterward. I also think it is helping my back pain!Definitely recommended!!"
4,vast array of immense knowledge in one video,The instructor has a lot of experience in a wide array of different tai chi styles. I have been looking for this video for a long time. The exercises are effectively designed to increase energy and focus for the day to come or increase calmness and awareness for the end of the day.
3,African,"This is fun and well developed 'genre' music for a very happy, sunny day..not for listening to in an enclosed space w/a fireplace and snowstorm raging..for example."
3,It's Okay But I've Used Better (3.5 Stars),"This lotion leaves a slight stickiness and dull sheen on my skin. I think it may be due to the glycerin, the second main ingredient. I've used better lotions, but this one still does the job."
3,Works OK,"The lotion works okay for my skin. It flakes off a little bit once it is dry, and leaves a somewhat dull residue on my skin. I like the smell, and it is relatively inexpensive."
2,Serious editorial problems!,"As a lifelong Alaskan and a frequent user of Lonely Planet, I peeked inside this book to see what it had to say about my home state.The editors must have been asleep on the job! Within 5 minutes, I identified three glaring errors: neighboring Whitehorse was listed as ""Whitehorse, British Columbia"" (it's the capital of the Yukon!) and our governor and congresspeople were hopelessly mixed up. I would also dispute the assertion that it is possible to see bears in or around downtown Anchorage.While none of those mistakes would seriously affect a tourist, I hate to imagine what else was overlooked in the editing process. It may be useful as a reference, but don't take it as the absolute truth, and double-check any information that's vital to your travel plans!"
3,Alaska?,It's too cold there so who would want to go there anyway. If I can discourage enough people from going maybe the wilderness can be saved.
5,"Great book, glad it's affordable and in print!","I love all of Alice's books, but I didn't pick up A YEAR IN CHOCOLATE while it was in hardcover. Now, instead of paying for a second-hand book, I was able to get CHOCOLATE HOLIDAYS, which is truly gorgeous. And, for a chocolate lover, how great to have such fun ideas for each holiday!This is a great book at a great price, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for holiday ideas or just anyone who loves chocolate."
3,Chocolate Holidays,The cookbook was purchased as a gift for my sister-in-law. The recipes were not as main stream as I had hoped. Hopefully the recipes will be worth the effort.
3,Good for Manual Quilting,"This book is helpful for those who want to manually guide quilting. It has no information on using the computer to place designs for a longarm machine, such as my HandiQuilter ProStitcher."
1,Never Recieved Book,"I ordered this book a month ago and I still have not received it, but my credit card has been charged. Each time I send a note of inquiry I receive a form e-mail back stating it could take 21 takes to receive, but it has now been 1 month."
5,Wonderful book,"I have used ""meander"" machine quilting in almost all of my quilts. I was ready for a change and this book pointed me in the right direction. I highly recommend this book to beginners as well as intermediate home machine quilters."
4,"Sally Terry's ""Pathways to better quilting""","I really enjoyed Sally Terry's approach to breaking down the ""pathways"" to help newbies see that many complicated patterns can be brought down to a level that any one can accomplish. The 5 shapes of quilting can be done by everyone and Sally shows you how to read quilt patterns."
3,Incredible...,"I have recently gotten into Incubus as a band mostly due to their lyrical content. For that reason I decided to get this book. That is also the reason I am only giving it three stars for my review. I bought this book hoping it would be a collection of his writings with some pictures in between but it turned out to be the other way around. Don't get me wrong Brandon is an incredible artist, but if you're looking for more writing and less drawing this isn't the book for you. I enjoy everything written in this book but for 30 some odd dollars I would like more writing and less art. Maybe I just missed the purpose of putting this book together but I figured I'd let others know about the lack of writing."
2,Look for the club mix CD single version instead,"I bought this single as the 3-panel CD single release, and I've been wondering why ""A Question of Honour,"" ""Heaven Is Here,"" and ""I Loved You"" (from Fly) appear after the title track IN THAT ORDER?... I got the 2-track version of this title with the Xenomania Club Mix. Since remixes are my life now, I'd advise you, if you have both ""Fly"" AND ""Time To Say Goodbye"" the albums, don't buy this single if it has four tracks on it; look for the 2-track club mix CD single instead... Bye."
5,perhaps tosh's finest hour....,"peter's performance at the one love peace concert remains one of reggae's most powerful moments, and to finally have it captured on disc is a blessing. tosh's great performance was preserved very well and sounds fabulous on this fine disc. this is the perfect tribute to the the great man that tosh was and still is. this concert took place in 1978 after peter had only released legalize it and equal rights, which i consider to be his two finest studio efforts, so the set list is incredible and his militant words are immortal. this is, in my opinion, the best tosh album and is a must for any fan of his. it's absolutely incredible."
2,a little bit obsessed?,"dogs life is a great song. and there is not an unattrative guy in the group. but aren't they a little old to be so obsessed with weed that they can't seem to rap about anything else? in the songs that AREN'T, amazingly, centered around smoking, the kottonmouth kings will blurt out something about getting high for no reason other than to remind us all that they like weed. these songs that aren't primarily about weed focus on nagging parents or cops in the attitude of a sixteen year old. the music is good, but only if you tune out the lyrics."
5,KMK are gonna be here for a while,"This cd is one of a kind. If you like the Beastie Boys, you'll love the KMK. They by no means copy the Beasties' sound, you can definitely hear an influence. Of the eighteen songs on Royal Highness, there is not one that I don't like. I can't remember this ever happening!!! These guys tell you how they feel regardless of what the DEA might have to say about it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Blaze on."
2,Kottonmouth Kings - Royal Highness,Ok so the CD was great but they didn't send it in the right casing. It was sent in a cardboard sleeve and had nothing to do with the original artwork. Never buying it again on here.
3,hmmmm.....,"i must tell the truth. i actually haven't listened to all the cd. i have heard the song ""bump"" on the radio though and i am deffinately getting the cd soon!"
4,My first listen of the Kottonmouth Kings,"I know i like them but not the lyrics. They are all about drugs and stuff and I have to give them 4 stars because i like the uniqueness of them. I like Them better than Limp Bizkit's type hardcore and Papa Roach too. I started listening to them when i heard ""Dogs' Life"" the second single ""Suburban Life"" and ""Bump"" but they are my fave rock/rap band after P.O.D."
1,I didn't think this was such a great album.,"Don't get me wrong, I like the Kottonmouth Kings as much as the next guy. One of my favorite songs is the original (unremixed) ""Suburban Life"" from the SCREAM 2 soundtrack, but something went wrong with the group from the soundtrack to their first single ""Stoners Wreck Havoc"". I think it was who ever mixed the songs because this entire album makes me think that the Kottonmouth Kings are def."
4,good stuff,"I like this album, it's a good stoner album and it was the first Kmk album I ever got even though I didn't even open myself up to them until 2004. Saint Dog is the man and all but I'm a big fan of JR and think he is a better fit then Saint. KMK have been around for a long time now and this is their first major release so many people will either love this one or hate the rest and claim they sold out when Saint left. I love this album but it's far from their best. With every album they get better beats and tighter skills and they evolve also. Some people can't accept that I guess. Anyways great cd so pick it up now!Great Songs:Bong Tokin' AlcoholicsPlay OnSuburban LifeLife Ain't What It SeemsBumpDog's LifePsychedelic FunkPlanet Budtron"
2,Was I really that stoned back then?,"Recently re-discovered this album in a dusty old box, and gave it a spin for the first time in about five years. At first I was excited to visit old times, as I had bought this when I was 14-15 or so, and absolutely loved it. I'm 20, and it's just ridiculous garbage to me now. These guys are friggin' dorks. How is this turd of an album getting a higher overall star rating than the likes of De La Soul's ""Stakes is High,"" or Redman's ""Whut? Thee Album""? Malarkey.After all of that, why was I so generous as to grace it with two stars? Because some of the production on one or two of the songs is actually pretty nice, like on Planet Budtron, and maybe a couple of others. If you had some decent emcees who weren't a bunch of jackasses rhyming over the beats, it might be a halfway decent album."
5,Da BOMB!!,I first heard KK on the Scream 2 soundtrack and have waited for almost a year for them to come out with a full cd. Once it came out I bounced right on it and it did not disappointed. One of the best cd's I own.
5,AWESOME PARTY CD,I heard them on the scream soundtrack. I knew i had to have it. since i've had i have to listen to it a least once a day.
4,Beautifully Written Look at a Small Town,"Connery writes of his adopted town, Kent, Connecticut. It is the sort of place where a newcomer remains so for some time. The book is broken down by seasons, each season full of colorful snippets of life in this town. Some of the tidbits are from long ago, and others from happenings the day that they were penned. Connery's style is such that each paragraph gives a feeling, a picture of the way things are and have been. The collection of these short observations gives one a very good feel for this place Connery calls home. It becomes an almost poetic look at a small town, and in a sense, at all small towns in America. This book can make one want to move to Kent, which would spoil the place for those who enjoy their solitude!"
2,SMELLY!!,"""The instrument itself sounds pretty good. my problem is the smell of the straps. They smell so much like petroleum that they give me a headache just trying to play it. I thought it would fade but its isn't really going away. I washed them with dish soap, scrubbed with ajax, hell I even tried rubbing alchol. still its there, Any ideas? seriously, its terrible."""
5,One of her Best,"This was one of the best of the Joe Sandilands series. I counldn't put it down and I look forward enthusiastically to the next in the series. I found it to be a real page turner; full of appropriate color of an interesting time in England. She captured the essence just right. And even though I have read all her other Sandilands books, and knew her style and techniques, I couldn't guess the ending. Great book."
5,Great product!,We use this shampoo all the time. It has a great clean scent and I would recommend it highly.
2,Microeconomics Review,The textbook is a little complicated to understand. You really have to take the time to read all of it in order to understand any of it. It could have been written with easier reading.
4,Satisfied,"The book was received in good condition. It was priced fairly. Most importantly, it was shipped and received very soon after it was ordered."
3,I Like the Title,"This CD was bought as a gift for my Dad, so I suppose I'd need his input after he receives it this Christmas."
2,More like songs that started WWII.,"I'm sorry, but the stuff that passed for music back in thesetimes were pathetic. Not that it's much better in the 2000s.Songs that got us through WWII???More likely, it's songs that probably started WWII."
4,Songs That Got Us Through WWII,"An excellent memorabilia collection carefully mixed to transport the listener into the period. Be prepared, if you're thinking of buying it, for acceptable but limited restoration quality. It is certainly up to the standard of the period but a tad short of modern CD quality. Once I got accustomed, it seemed part of the memorabilia. Highly recommended enjoyable listening."
5,Absolute Classic!!! Ultimate concept album!!!!!,I was fortunate to see Marillion play this album live at Massey Hall in Toronto. The album has no stops between songs so is like one huge song which is different for an album. I ran out and bought the album the next day and the album was like a drug for my whole first year in University. I played it every night and probably would have slit my wrists without it(slight exaggeration but you get the point). Fish weaves such a spell live it is incredible and although I've seen many concerts that night singing songs with Marillion and a sold out crowd is one I will never forget. I'll always remember Fish taking a break after a song and while sitting on a drum riser telling us all a hilarious joke. Buy this album it is one for people who appreciate musical genius and poetry in their music.
5,The last great progressive rock band!,"I first heard of Marillion when they opened for RUSH during their 1986 Power Windows tour. Usually, I don't have the patience for opening bands, but this one blew me away! I remember they played the entire album and I didn't want it to end.MISPLACED CHILDHOOD is like one 41-minute continuous progressive rock journey that can be compared to old Genesis music with Peter Gabriel. However, lead singer Fish gives the band its own flavor and essence. The album is a mid-eighties progressive rock gem!"
5,Awesome!!!,How much I love Fish the old singer of Marillion!! And this album from beginning to end is awesome!! Thank you for the great music you gave us Fish!!!!
1,"REPEATITIVE SONGS, NO VALUE FOR MONEY","I have been a fan of surrealistic Marillion music for more than 20 years. I especially enjoyed the early releases. However it puzzles me why any fan would rate this compilation ""Misplaced Childhood"" by more than one star, if any. I purchased it without looking at its track titles, only to discover repeated tracks in a two-disc, pricey CD set. Out of 20 songs in the set, 15 are repeatitions, two of them are recorded three times!!! This is unacceptable and I would say, shows lack of respect for fans who buy the CDs.Yes I love Marillion music, but I'd rather use my stereo player to replay my favorite tracks as many times as I want. The repeated tracks in this CD set are slightly different but this is not a good justification and there is no value for money here, especially at a price of $19.99 plus shipping. I do not recommend this CD set. You're better off buying the original releases, or pay $0.99 to download each individual song."
2,Shadows of greatness,"2 1/2I suppose the 80's were a tough decade to get your progressive fix, but that is no excuse for this simply being derivative mostly of lesser Genesis, with a small helping of greater."
4,Just like being there live,"A live performance of They Might Be Giants is a life changing experience. The Johns delight in encouraging the audience to participate with them. Listen to this album, and you will have the urge to Conga!"
3,They Might Be Disappointed,"Severe Tire Damage, They Might Be Giant's second album in a row with little new material, has its ups and downs, seemingly like every TMBG record released (except possibly ""Lincoln,"" and ""Flood""). The reason why those albums far exceed this one is because the material that was good was very, very good and, well, new. It's ""ups"" are the new tracks: ""Doctor Worm,"" ""They Got Lost,"" and ""First Kiss,"" which proves to all of us that They Might Be Giants still have ""it"" in them, but just are releasing ""it"" little at a time. The live tracks that are pretty much similar to those on the original albums are the ones I most enjoy, although the ones which sound somewhat different (like ""Particle Man"") are interesting to listen to. Supposedly, problems with their former record label prevented TMBG from releasing additional new material have been cleared up and a brand new album is expected in 1999. Let's hope it's as good as the ones before this."
5,Strange album,"The concept is supposed to a mix of live album stuff with studio songs thrown in as well. It's works for me, but I would have loved to hear their versions of other classic songs by them and instead there are new songs and strange improvisations on watching ""Planet of the Apes."" I mainly give this album a good rating because the new live versions of songs make them sound more refreshing and louder as well and the studio tracks aren't bad either, the ""...Apes"" tracks are hit and miss, though."
1,Ughh...,"What a disappointment! I've followed They Might Be Giants from their culmination as the Strangest of the Strange back in the 80's to present day, and I'm sad to say I was highly disappointed by this album. The live tracks (the vast majority) seem uninspired and bland, and the absolutely abyssmal cut of ""The sun is a mass of incandescent gas"" left me punching the ""forward"" button faster than the attack of a mantis shrimp. Ugh!The only redeeming thing on this album is the intriguing song Doctor Worm... but I couldn't help thinking how much better it had been had it not been so overproduced and loud - imagine the song with nothing but percussion and vocals; that would have been a truly amazing song, not the ""listen to us kids! listen to us kids! version that festoons Severe Tire Damage.Do yourself a favor and pass this mess up and get John Linnell's far superior solo effort ""State Songs"" instead, or break out TMBG's ""Apollo 18"" and revel in what the band USED to be."
4,"great record, but why live?","Can a music lover get a non-live version of TMBG greatest hits? Why do we wait and have to hear screaming college kids in the backgound and bad acoustics. C'mon concert albums went out with ""Peter Frampton comes alive"" and Rush's ""All the Worlds a Stage"" in 1974.John and John do their best work in the studio- sorry organic, lead ear, ernstwhile fans. Please rematster the original studio tracks and overcharge us for those. Im buying."
4,Great introduction to TMBG,"This is one of the greatest cds I have (I don't give out 5 stars much). If you like some TMBG hit you might hear on the radio (they are the ones that did Particle Man, Istanbul Not Constantinople, and Birdhouse in Your Soul back in 1990) GET THIS! It's a live album, with a lot of popular TMBG hits. Most of the songs are done well, but some of them can't be done so well live (Particle Man, Why Does the Sun Shine) Anyway, it's still a great cd. Go buy it if you like anything you've heard by TMBG. If you really like this album go to Flood or Then: The Early Years."
3,satisfactory - i'm dissapointed in the johns,"The hidden tracks are boring, and I think the studio versions of the hits are much better than the live ones. Overall, I think the Johns quality has been going downhill ever since john henry. They're still the most talented rockers ever, but they seem to be trying to become mainstream, which is the exact opposite of what made we fans like them in the first place! Guys - get back to what you're good at - really weird, fun, witty music that no one else CAN do, instead of stuff that sells, but sounds just like everybody else."
3,Good but nothing special,"For someone who's waited a while for an album that captures TMBG's live charm, this album just doesn't seem to quite cut it. Even though it's 24 tracks or so, it's still too short, especially since the last 6 tracks are hidden, and most are of bad bootleg quality. The ""new"" versions of older favorites like Birdhouse and Ana-Ng are decent, and They Got Lost is great, but XTC vs. Adam Ant doesn't seem that much different than the album version. Overall, I'd have to say, although a solid album, there's definitely something lacking here."
2,Why a live album?,"I love They Might Be Giants...I've loved them since 1990 when I bought ""Flood."" But for the life of me, I can't figure out why they made this particualr album. First of all, most of the ""live"" versions presented here are not all that different from the studio ones. Oh, except for the fact that they're poorly mixed. The song selection is not all that great, either (do we really need a live version of ""Spider?""). Some of the songs don't even sound like they were recorded live, but rather ""re-recorded"" in the studio. Why, I ask? A few notable exceptions: ""Why Does The Sun Shine"" is absolutely awesome here, in addition to a slightly peppier version of ""Particle Man.""After fourteen years of entertaining us with their crazy, hilarious, and endlessly catchy music, John and John have never actually released an out-and-out ""bad"" album. But this one comes awful close. Come on guys, go back to what you do the best."
3,Braun Freeglider,Comparable to other electric shavers. Problem is trying to find replacement screen and cutter in local market. It will probably be phased out in future.
4,Why Is The Ethiopian Orthodox Church Forgotten ?,"The Ethiopian church is one of the oldest orthodox church in the world however, I was really surprised not to find it anywhere in the book."
4,A Very Mysterious Book,"The book Lights Out is a very good mystery book because is very intense all the way to the end. At times it might even make you jump. It's about a girly girl named Holly that, in order to help her uncle, goes to his summer camp and works as a counselor. She starts to realize that at the camp not so normal things are happening. She decides to figure out why, what, and who is causing these weird things. At times it gets really intense. For example, Holly gets really scared and it even scares like when she thinks someone is trying to kill her just like they killed another counselor. It's a really good mystery book that keeps you interested the whole way through, because after one thing happens another happens right after. I would recommend this book to people who like R.L. Stine because he writes mainly murder, mystery type books. It's a really good book."
5,...Oh My God...,"A book of a girl, Holly, who goes to camp to work as a couselors for her Uncle. Only to find out a mystery. Each signatured with a ruby red feather. The killer is...find out and read a book that'll literally won't make you put the book down."
4,You'll NEVER ?guess? what will happen next !,"This book is very good! This girl named holie is asked by her uncle to come and help him with his camp. one thing she doesn't know is that someone is out to kill her. at first some major acidents hapen and luckly no one is killed but soon many people start to die. The scary thing is that at each acident holie finds a red feather and she knows something is up but no one will lisen to her not even her uncle. soon without knowing it she has come face to face with the killer. actully she is out in a small paddle boat in the middle of major rapids with the killer, the paddles are throun out and....... well I'll let you find out! You must read this book."
3,Meh,"I had to read this book for a class, and have to admit that I wasn't thrilled with it. The characters are almost entirely unlikeable, and the jumping narrative is sometimes hard to follow. However, I liked that it gave the other side of the Israel/Palestine conflict, as it showed a member of the PLO as a human fighting for her people rather than an evil terrorist fighting just to kill."
1,25 pages missing from the book I purchased!,"It was a great book until I had to begin filling in the story line by myself! 25 pages were missing from the book, even though I paid full price for it..very disappointing to begin the story only to find that there are blank pages."
5,Crocky Went Boom!,"Another great children tale that should be read by people. along side with fairy tales and folklores.It's a story about a little orphaned black girl named Little Black Mingo, who is unfortunate enough to lived with a horrid abusive old woman named Black Noggy, who made her do impossible chores. In perfoming one of the chores, she was kidnapped by a mugger (crocodile) and it brought her to a faraway island where her little eggs were. There Little Black Mingo met the Mongoose who drove the mugger mad in rage by eating its eggs. The Mugger tried alot of ways to keep the mongoose away but he failed. It even chased them back to Little Black Mingo's home, but end up blown into bits with Black Noggy. Care to read how that happened personally? ^_~"
2,Scary story,"I think this story would scare young children as it was about aligators pursuing people and eating them. I was mildly amused as an adult, but would steer clear of this for youngsters."
5,Great product,"I love this product. After only 3 days of use, my skin looks like I have been at the beach for a long weekend. It goes on very smoothly, no streaking or patchiness. Much better than any other self tanner on the market. I have tried department store expensive brands and other national brands that are synonomous with outdoor tanning. It is great and I highly recommend it. Thanks!"
2,Nothing to talk about,"Not all it was hyped up to be. It was good to see, Antonio, at a young age, playing this role, but the story, acting, etc. nothing to write about or rush to see."
3,LIGHT,"Light light, Imeans I've seen better. I love Almodovar's movies but this one is yes...light! The good great best point of it is Victoria Abril, Pedro's Muse!? She is hot hot hot!!! She's a porn star who is kidnapped by a fan, and she finally loves loves loves him because of the Stocklom syndrome? Some scenes are really good so that makes the film a soft porno movie! But please they could have thought of anything hotter than Banderas!>>> Nely"
1,Misogynistic Garbage,"Unfunny and ridiculous plot glorifies disgusting behavior such as drug abuse and violence toward women. Lame attempts at humor fail - are we to believe the woman would fall in love with her attacker and live happily ever after? Come on, the only thing they got right was rating it NC-17. Calling itself a comedy does not a comedy make. There are plenty of other far superior Antonio Banderas films to watch. The single great thing about this film - the amazing Penelope Cruz credits it to what motivated her to become an actress."
1,how do i return it,CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE ME THE ADDRESS TO SEND THIS BACK. My roommate threw out the box it came in. It doesn't work
5,A work of astonishing beauty and insight,"*Any* Happy Rhodes album is worth owning. This title, the most recent of her material that I can find, is stunningly good. I also recommend ""Building the Colossus"" (please note that the critic couldn't spell, either). Fortunately for those of you who just got Happy as a blip on your radar, this (MWABT) disc is one that's still available. Her earlier works seem to have either been taken out of circulation or have just become very hard to find. So buy this while you still can, then sit down and listen to it."
5,Happy I know Happy's Music,"I am still a huge Kate Bush Fan. I discovered Happy in the mid-1990's when I plugged Kate Bush's name into a (pre-Google) search engine and found Happy Rhodes mentioned as a comparable stylist. I went to Silver Platters and bought ""Equipoise"". I listened to it nearly every day for a year. I own all of Happy's CDs and routinely include them in my ""rotation"". I have often wondered why Happy's music never caught on in the mainstream community. Her music is arguably the best (in pop/rock genres) extant. I keep expecting her to be discovered by Oprah - if more people were exposed to her sound, the Amy Winehouses of the world would shudder with fear - Happy is THAT good.""Many Worlds"" is one of Happy's best efforts. In the last ten years, I've probably listened to it 150-200 times. I never tire of her music. It's sad more people haven't been exposed to her, brutally sad."
5,The Midas touch,"This is one of those one label mixed CD's. Pagen specializes in cool British Deep House. This selection is very deep, but Derrick keeps the listener from drowning like so many deep house DJs can't understand. Not a single bad selection, and a few work in appropiate vocals. I only wish the vocals on 'Mr. Roachclip' were turned up. I heard an older slower hip-house version a few years back. Very funny skit involving Tommy Chong as Mr. Roachclip. Play this one late and you'll adore it. Its not Derrick's best, but no one else would do it better."
5,Good service and good condition of the book!,I love Elizabeth Elliot's books and share them with my family! They are so encouraging and helpful in living God's Way! Your service was wonderful and the book was in great condition! Thank you!
2,Country Girlhood,"This was a quaint book of childhood memories of growing up on a farm. I was disappointed as I found it to be amateurishly written but all-in-all it was fairly enjoyable complete with good photos. I found it to be a little too heavy on her reminisces of the bad hands dealt her as an adult. Also, growing up on a farm myself, I found it too unbelievable that the author would have such sheer terror of spiders(??!)"
1,You'd Better Buy Both Albums Separate(Sound Stinks),"I bought this two for one in the hopes I would not have to buy both albums on cd.After listening to this import of BS&T 3 and 4 I have no choice because the sound on the so called remaster is horrible.It sounds choppy,scratchy in some places and like the engineer tried to edit every last bit of background noise(but just made things worse).BS&T lovers,avoid this import and just buy both american release albums separately.Just when I thought the Ides Of March (Vehicle) import album sounded bad,this one is in the same league."
4,The second Best of BST,"This is a very good CD, if you like the early 70's BST. I bought it for the BST Three portion as that is one of my favorite records. I would not buy BST Four on its own, but with a CD player I can skip through to the best of BST Four.KJ"
4,Let's get sadistic!,"Am I the first online to review this? This is a sort of odd poppy -progressive hybrid from early 1970's Japan (now how many of those made it out of the country?) Some of it kind of sounds to these ears like Be-Bop Deluxe or Camel in Japanese; the title track of ""Black Ship"" is kinda Pink Floyd-y; occasionally the female singer shrieks like Yoko at her best. (That's a compliment.) A good choice for fans of prog and the unusual who like music sung in languages other than English and a bargain: two original lps one on cd. There is a 3rd lp by the group called ""Hot Menu"" apparently not issued or available on cd which I have not heard."
3,"Dull debut, solid sophomore","While the self-titled debut can verge on boring, BS's more free-form funk fusion makes the fun release worth getting to know."
2,"Wrong piece, hard to assemble","This item could be great, but it was harder to assemble than it should have been. The worst thing was the wrong leg was sent for one of the four sides, so there's a 2 inch piece of wood sticking out of one end.Not worth the money at all."
3,A bit of a let down,"Although I have enjoyed all Laura Love's other albums that I have listened to I think Fourteen Days is not a good pick, especially for someone new to her. The songs seemed very simple and a little childish; several songs reminded me of a previous songs on the same album. There were only a few highlights, mostly in the lyrics. I think that any other album she has made would be a better choice. All of the others are very good."
1,Stinky Lotion,"Some sort of an electric pre-shave lotion makes for a very nice shave. Therefore, when I saw this product, I tried it out. The liquid conditioner that is automatically applied with this shave has a very strong fragrance. (SO strong that it gave me a headache- How would YOU like it if someone chose a fragrance for you to wear, a fragrance that you didn't like? :-( ). If it were possible for me to replenish the conditioner cartridges with my very favorite ""Williams Lectric Shave,"" I would keep this shaver. However, Braun is trying to make a market for themselves in these cartridges and they are one-time use."
1,"Outdated, should be rewritten","As oracle has intoduced rman with version 8 as its primary backup tool, I expected the book to dwell mainly on the new tool and explain features, usage and common procedures for backup/recovery with rman in depth. All of this is missing. Barely 60 pages are devoted to rman and half of them is about creating a standby database (which is not what I want right now !). I think this book had it merits in Version 7 and probably it covers all the old stuff very well, but it is nearly useless for version 8. Unfortunately there seems to be no better book on this subject right now."
2,Very Little description of RMAN,"This book has a very little descrition of RMAN, which is new to Oracle 8. I thought this book might cover RMAN and an integration with Legato, Networker or any other third party backup solution product, a little bit , but it did not. It is still a good conceptual book."
2,Still has errors after all these years.,"The book hasn't changed much since the Version 6 edition. Velpuri still doesn't cover the ""Consistent"" export parameter even after the publisher was notified several times! Also, the book badly needs diagrams to illustrate some of the more difficult technical discussions."
5,You must read & re-read this book,"This is the most important book for DBA's to read, and really understand. When RMAN & SAPDBA take a dump all over your database, you had better hope that you have often repeated the exercises in this book & have understood the concepts explained there in.2AM on a Sunday night and operations can't start the database, and RMAN is out, and ls says your data is gone, and fsck is complaining & etc...you better hope you have it together as per this book.This book is the major jump off point on the road to getting (and keeping) 6 figures.Buy it, and spend a year or so studying it."
5,"Excellent, high energy music.",I like Zydeco but this album is truly wonderful. It immediately became one of top ten favorite albums and continues to amaze me. I consider this band a well kept secret waiting to be discovered by the general public. Everyone who has heard it loves it. The quality is consistent through the whole album.
4,Great Modern Zydeco,Jocque and the boys (the Hi-Rollers) really give it up on this album. Lots of foot stomping hi-numbers as well as a few slower tempo songs. Tequila is a great cover done in Zydeco style as well as many great originals. Also check out Keith Frank (On a Mission) for another example of great modern Zydeco. Buy it album and be prepared to dance. Enjoy.
3,His Pilot's View,"I was Jim's pilot in WWII and was astounded by some of his ""recollections"", but, then, does an auther have to (or should he) tell the truth? His job is creating images."
2,Lack of Praise for The World as a Lie,"We all think about walking in someone else's shoes. As a biographer, the journey should be rational, orderly, objective, without bias. Henry Hart fails on these points in the chronology of James Dickey, but succeeds in his own efforts to promote himself, using Dickey as a vehicle. Mr. Hart is much like American cigarettes; ""much air and little tobacco"". From Dickey's genteel southern upbringing to his war service record (Mr. Hart sees military procedures, practices, and routines as ""cute"" or ""strange""), from his ventures in the jungles of commercial advertising to his non-stop committments on the lecture/poetry circuit, Mr. Hart only reflects on himself as the naive little boy pressing his face to the Christmas-time storefront window of life experiences. What's it all about, Henry?"
3,An okay Dutch dictionary at a reasonable price,"Among the Dutch dictionaries available in the U.S., this is one of the most comprehensive and useful that I've found, in spite of its shortcomings. This dictionary is admittedly rather out of date, so modern words and spellings are lacking. The print is also somewhat hard to read, and no pronunciations are provided for Dutch words. Finally, this dictionary is mainly best as an aid for translating from Dutch to English, since the English-Dutch section is limited. Still, it contains numerous examples of idiomatic expressions and word usages often lacking in concise dictionaries. Given its reasonable price, I think this is a useful reference for an English-speaking student of Dutch to own, although he or she will likely wish to complement it with a source for more modern vocabulary and slang."
2,Out of date,"I'm still looking for a good modern Dutch / English dictionary. This was written just after World War II and hasn't been updated. It's thorough and probably a good dictionary for its time, but hardly relevant now!"
2,language error,"Having lived in Holland for six years and now running a small business l have found this book usefull in writing letters and so forth. However l have found an error which leads me to think that there may be more than the one. The book translates `Pissebed` and `Paardenbloem` both as meaning Dandelion. This is incorrect. Pissebed means Woodlouse, Paardenbloem means Dandelion. Woodlouse is further translated as Houtluis which may be so , however l have never heard anyone name a woodlouse anything but a Pissebed."
1,Needs to be enhanced.,Not one iota of pronunciation nor usage is given. Definitely not for beginners. I feel lucky I found an excellent dictionary of Dutch-my mother tongue after purchasing this one.
3,Misleading publication date,"As another reviewer said, it's a bit out of date. Worse, Amazon's claimed publication date (1982) is actually a reprint date. It was first published in 1949 and has not been updated."
5,Hands down my favorite PSP game,"I loved playing my PSP, but hated that all the games in my collection take a long time to play. I really wanted something that I could play even if I only had five minutes, like Tetris. That's when I stumbled upon this game, which IMO is even better than Tetris -- I'm SO glad I bought it! My favorite feature is that the game actually begins with blocks to shift, compared with Tetris where I always had to make challenges for myself on the first few levels so I wouldn't get bored. I know it's already been said but it deserves to be said again: If you like Tetris, or games like Columns and Blockout for the old Sega Genesis -- This is a game for you. I've only owned it a few weeks and I've already played it more than any other game I own!"
2,Variation? Not so much. . .,"Honestly I can't say much for a game that has a theme that's been done so many times before and yet still neglects to provide any real variation. The only variation is in the characters which are not all that much different other than thier color and that doesn't score too many points in my book. I think this genre has hit a creative wall. If you are planning on buying this title, makes sure you buy it USED so you don't feel like such a waste."
2,Trimmer is Useless,"It looks sleek and is small and lightweight. Unfortunately, the pop-OUT trimmer is useless. It pops out about 2/3 of the way up so you can't see what you're trimming and can't cut those long hairs that the foil refuses to cut. Why do so many models have useless trimmers? The shave is close, but it takes forever. Although sleek-looking, this one's going back."
1,This one is going back.,"I bought mine last week and have been very disappointed. It did not come with a case, the side mounted trimmer is virtually useless, and the slidng switch is very hard to activate.Every other shaver I ever bought came with a ""travel"" case to keep it's various parts together. This one didn't.The Trimmer folds out at a right angle to the body of the razor which puts it completely in the wrong position for proper use in trimming hair.The sliding switch was designed with a built in lock which is pushed in to allow switching to the On positions. I found the switch on this shaver very difficult to activate. I was hoping after several days it would wear in and become easier. Instead it has gotten significantly worse, to the point where it is barely usable."
3,"Slow, can't handler longer stubble","This may be true in general about foil shavers, but this shaver cannot handle anything but very short stubble. Being blond, I can get away with shaving every 2-3 days. This shaver is not a good choice unless you shave every day.The side trimmer is a little akward, and this shaver needs a full charge every time to take on my beard. I bought this because I thought it would be a good travel shaver. I'd hoped I could charge it once and use it for a week or two. This shaver can only shave my beard once maybe twice before getting tired and needing a recharge. Plugging in the shaver doesn't make it run faster, you need to wait for it to charge first.It's a cute shaver but doesn't cut it for my thick beard and every-other-day shaving style."
1,NOT THE TRIMMER PROBLEM ONLY!,"I bought this for my husband as a replacement for a PANASONIC ES7017. I didn't want to bother w/ replacement foil cutters, so I jumped on the Friday deal. Even for $19.90, this shaver isn't worth ordering. 1st - it's soooo small, 2nd- either the foil cutters are bad, or the whole shaver is not powerfull enough (took 25mins to shave, as opposed to 10mins w/ the old Panasonic), 3rd- the trimmer can't possibly perform as a trimmer, 4th- fedex?/ups? delivered in a torn box. Conclusion-don't buy this product!"
2,Marilyn Manson,"Marilyn Manson is a really sick man ....I mean who in the world would take out one of their ribs just so they could uh......let's not say.He sick and sicotic and really needs help...Although a few of his songs such as: ""Dopeshow"" Beautiful People"" and maybe 1 other are good he still could change his attitude toward GOD."
4,An Interesting Mix,"There is definitely more good songs on this album than bad, and I think it's worth buying. The two best songs on the album are by Supergrass and Self, two bands I had never heard of before. My old favorites such as Manson, Goldfinger, and Creed didn't disappoint me either. The Blur and Elastica songs are mediocre, and no other songs on the album are particularly memorable."
2,. . .,I bought this cd to hear the golden years Manson's version. It was okay; sort of disapointing. The rest was plain annoying except for the twigy and twigy song.
2,only 2 good songs,"I bought this CD only for the Creed song Bound an d Tied, and its the best one on the CD. Cowboy Song, and Golden Years aren't bad. I hate all the other songs. CREED ROCKS."
5,never heard it but this is for that louisiana person,"um sorry but manson DID NOT HAVE ANY RIBS REMOVED. Are you so imcompetent as to belive that anyone would actually remove any of there ribs, bones that protect the heart and lungs. lets think, if thats at all possible for you. ok hick? good ,cuz im done. end. sansho."
3,"Nice boot, but narrow toe box","Pretty short boot with nice leather - very useful, but for me the toe was too pointed, although it was a square toe, it was narrow. So although I normally wear and 8.5 in this brand, this boot was too small for me and I returned it."
5,One seriously jammin' CD,"Like some of the other reviewers, I first heard Brooklyn Heights on the radio in Southern California and was fortunate enough to finally hear who it actually was (after a period of looking for a band called Brooklyn Heights who had a song called ""Down to the Bone"" - couldn't find them ). I bought the CD online immediately and have listened to it at work, sometimes continuously in a 10-hour day.The first time I put the CD in and heard the Title song I thought to myself, ""Whoa, this is good!"", and that was just the first few seconds.I like practically all types of music (can't handle rap and fortunately there is nothing ""rap-like"" on this CD), and this group has put itself on my ""Highly Recommended to anyone who appreciates any kind of music"" list.Can't wait for something new to come out. Gonna buy anything older that they have. Will be looking for them to come to Houston someday."
4,"after hearing one of the songs, had to have the CD",First heard 'Brooklyn to Manhatten' being played over the sound system prior to an outdoor concert. Heard it again over our 'soft jazz' station and knew I had to get this recording. Great beat to exercise to. Wish I had a longer drive to work!
2,boring percussion and empty riffs,"After reading the five-star reviews I bought this nonsense CD, an absolute bore, except for the hypnotic, great track ""Brooklyn Heights"". Now that's a groovin' track. All the rest here are mindless, monotonous pieces pumping away in a most annoying way. But ""Brooklyn Heights"" is outstanding!"
3,It is what it is,"My other half heard one of their songs on an internet station and wanted the album. She likes it and that's all that counts. Myself, I'd rather listen to traffic."
2,NOT THAT INSPIRED,"When I heard ""brooklyn heights"" I hoped that this band had other songs in the same vein, but they do not.The rest of the cd sounds like uninspired acid-jazz, with not enough musical chances taken.""Brooklyn Heights"" is such a great track, that it makes the rest of the cd seem inferior!It seems like these dudes have the right idea of musicality, but they don't seem to take it as far as they should.It sounds like they don't want to scare off their ""smooth jazz"" audience, so they keep the songs flat, and boring.Had potential, but falls flat.ReenoWWW.SPAZZOID.COM"
1,Can someone explain,"why this album cost nearly $60? I was looking to buy it, but not for that kinda price. My ""lone star"" rating does not reflect my review but it's cost."
4,Seinfeld - 1971,"I rented this and was pleasantly shocked. A very mature movie with genuinely great dialogue. The banter and over analysis by each character truly is Seinfeldian and I'm sure YEARS ahead of its time. The use of the camera is also delectible; often you will hear conversations by characters off screen while the camera is focused on someone merely ""listening"". Often a character will be looking straight at the camera (YOU) while they are speaking to another making you feel like you are more connected to the movie. And of course Jack has a big tirade that brings the house down!The only unfortunate aspects are Candice Bergen disappearing midway through and an ending that was less than fulfilling. A perfect rental and a good buy; if your a Jack fan it's good, if your a fan of thoughtful conversation it's a MUST! And I hear that ""Arthur"" Garfunkel fella has a side project... something to do with.. music? And a decent actor to boot."
2,Ridiculous,"Carnal Knowledge had all the intelligence of sixth-grade boys giggling during a game of Spin the Bottle. I've met a lot of half-wits in life but they were geniuses compared to the pubescent mentality of the characters in this film. These were college students? Were there really people this goofy in college? Yes, in this and that way, certainly including me feeling my blind way through an overwhelming cosmos. But to call this film ""intelligent"" is like giving a nobel prize in physics to an adolescent boy upon smoking his first cigarette. Carnal Knowledge can be summarized with one word: ridiculous."
3,Too melodramatic,"I always enjoy Jack Nicholson and Ann-Margret movies. However, their lack of experience really showed in this flick. I don't remember ever looking at women in the same perspective as Nicholson and his partner did. I also don't remember women being so outspoken on matters of romance and marriage as did the two in this movie.The acting was too dry and the mood was a little too melodramatic. However, the chauvinism was certainly reflected for the day.I would recommend it only if you enjoy seeing Ann-Margret in the buff. But what man wouldn't?"
2,Coming to the screens of film schools everywhere...,"What I found so impressive about this in the early 70's is a mystery--unless it's Ann-Margret's statuesque figure. Most of the dialog is better suited for writer Jules Feiffer's stylish cartoon characters. Even Jack Nicholson can't keep this tub afloat, although it's fun to see mannerisms and intonations which were used to perfection only 3 years later in the incomparable ""Chinatown."""
1,lots of scenes cut out,"I was looking for the uncut version. It was a christmas gift and the person I gave it to was not satisfied, they wanted the uncut version."
3,"""You Can't Have Me, I Already Have Me"" ~' '70's Narcissism At Its Zenith","'Carnal Knowledge' released in '71 tells the story of two friends obsessed with themselves and their personal sexual fantasies and desires.Jonathan (Jack Nickelson) has no problem getting the ladies into bed, his problem is communicating verbally with them after the great event. Ao the other hand Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is an accomplished communicator but is unable to make the transition from friend to sex partner with his girlfriend Susan (Candice Bergen).This is narcissism and '70's nihilism at its zenith. The film does deliver strong performances , but the subject matter and the spiraling negativism is a little hard to endure. One of the main draws of this movie is Ann-Margret who looks fantastic, it's worth a viewing just for her."
5,A COMPLETE BEST OF ALBUM..,"ALL 20 SONGS ARE THE VERY BEST BY CHRISTINA AND THE GREAT BAND--THE DIVINYLS..FROM 1981--1993,THEY HAVE PROVED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE BANDS..BOYS IN TOWN--ONLY LONELY--MAKE YOU HAPPY--PLEASURE AND PAIN--BACK TO THE WALL--I TOUCHED MY SELF--ONE OF MY FAVORITE CDS--MAKE THIS ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES ALSO--THE DIVINYLS ARE A PURE AND RAW ROCK N'ROLL BAND."
5,Cute!,I read this in 5th grade and still remember how much I enjoyed it since I loved mysteries. Pick it up and read it. It even has their lemonade recipe in the book!
1,Poor Quality / Broken and Missing Parts,"First of all, what is not in the description is that this item is made in Mexico. Ever since Klein has moved their manufacturing out of the USA, quality has suffered.The unit that I received is of very cheap construction. The plastic is very thin, and not very stiff for an item that is marketed to be used on jobsites. Included in the box was a spare handle. However, this spare was broken! Also, the top cap was missing. Klein was not able to send replacement parts, so the sent me an exchange unit. This unit was received without the spare handle, and the cover was included this time, but it was defective in that it was bulged on one side.Very poor quality from Klein/Mexico."
2,Size,"advertisement never gave dimensions of overall size nor dimensions of lower box capacity. Had to take a chance on size being big enough by looking at picture. Once received, size was totally inadequate for the tools that were intended."
3,HUGE HUGE HUGE watergun for the stout kid...but mine leaked...,"I almost didn't want to write this review and give it a low star rating because I am sure this is a wonderful gun...if mine didn't leak. It was brand new and leaked out of the seams the first time I filled it up with water....ARGH!! Also, this thing is HUGE! It is heavy empty, and even heavier when full of water. I couldn't imagine an 8 year old carrying this around full of water unless they are a stout 8 year old. One last gripe...with the amount of water it puts out, it doesn't stay full for very long...meaning many trips to the faucet to fill-er-up. With the size of this gun it should have an auxiliary backpack."
4,water gun fun,"I bought two of these. One was brilliant, worked perfectly and is the best water gun I have ever used. The other sadly didnt work properly and didnt have the same amount of power, it was still ok but just an average water gun.-"
5,Orca Review,This was a great value. I had checked Amazon and the price was right. A few weeks later I was pleasantly surprised to find it had been reduced! We used one last year during a July 4th parade a friend had loaned to me. The price was great and we did not have to hunt down a water gun as a Christmas.
5,How to get what you want from your man anytime,"I was so impressed with this book. It should be a handbook for all women and men. Her no-nonsense approach and down to earth simple techniques and ways of being is a must-read for everyone.It is an easy read, just flows, I could not put it down. I will be reading it again and marking it up and studying it to make it a part of me. She has a great message for us all, and is very inspirting. This book will change your life, if you let it."
2,Not worth the trouble.,"OK, having been a fan of Doug Pinnick (as a member of King's X) for 12 years I was looking forward to this. But I like only a handful of songs here. The bass is great, but do you really want to listen to Doug's moaning about life? Pass."
2,"Well, I had high expectations, but . . .","I really thought this would be great after reading the reviews. Unfortunately, after listening to this CD a few times, it dawned on me just how uninspiring these songs really are. They are all about the same tempo and just don't have any enthusiasm.My second complaint is the recording. This has got to be the muddiest mix that I've ever heard on a CD."
4,Suprisingly amazing heavy rock/metal album!,"This is a band formed by the singer/bass player of legendary heavy rock band KING'S X. It is a bit more heavier than that band, but shares simialrities, as Dug is singing, though plays guitar here. It is muc hheavier than KING'S X, more like many modern metal bands, and just simply very cool and different. Hear this!"
1,Pure garbage,"This book was writen, by a brazilian marxist.This book claims to be military history, but it is a completely fake.The ""hero"" of this book, Francisco Solano Lopez among so many other despicable things killed his own brother, he killed two brothers-in-law and he sent to jail and torture his own mother.In fact when Solano Lopez's mother was freed by brazilian militaries, she told that her dead son hadn't no dignity, of his respect."
4,Nice and fairly short,"I enjoyed the Mega Mix Blast-off because it was fairly short and great when you don't have much time. As with most Richard Simmons videos, the first time watching the tape is the hardest. This one has a quick weight workout at the end, so your muscles don't kill the next day and you still see great results. I think his videos are such a success because you become hooked and keep coming back for more. This this tape is no exception."
4,Great workout- please note it uses weights!,"This is the first Richard Simmons workout I have tried, and it hooked me! I don't LOVE the music (a mix of recognizable songs and originals), but it's not bad. I have since purchased a few other Simmons videos and this is definitely the most vigorous. It was a little hard to keep up with the first time, but as with all of his workouts IT GETS EASIER EVERY TIME. And it is fun; I have small children and they LOVE this video.It is worth noting, that after the warmup/workout/cooldown (about 25 minutes), there is a 10 minute bonus toning workout. You use wrist weights. You could probably use dumbbells if you already have them."
5,"""Hello, I Must Be Going.................""","If you are a true Marx brothers fan, then you MUST own this collection! This 3 CD set features all the music from the first 11 Marx films. The quality of the recordings is terrific, and very well edited. The liner notes are a little strange, but if you're already a hardcore Marxist (my favorite typo on the set is ""Sweat Adeline"" instead of ""Sweet Adeline""!), then you know the music by heart anyway. Worth buying just to hear Groucho sing ""Hooray for Captain Spaulding"" and ""Lydia, the Tattooed Lady"". Chico and Harpo are well represented, with classics such as ""Everyone Says I Love You"" and ""Why Am I So Romantic?"" These tunes show off their respective talents very nicely. Just a great collection. Pick this one up while you still can."
3,All the music from most of the films,"If you're a Marx Brothers afficionado, you should consider this collection. It contains all of the music (as well as a bit of dialog) from the Marx Brothers' first 11 films (""A Night In Casablanca"" and ""Love Happy"" are not represented). The transfers are excellent and the editing is pretty good too. However, the liner notes are a bit bizarre, and information on individual pieces is woefully incomplete, so if you own a decent copy of each of these movies on video, this collection is probably not necessary (especially realizing that the musical scenes in Marx Brothers movies are the average person's cue to hit the fast-forward button). But if you're a completist, or you really do enjoy the music and don't want to bother making your own ""Marx Mix"" on CD or cassette, this collection is for you."
4,Susie n' Burt... dee-licious!,"A quietly sparkling gem of a movie, featuring an off-kilter July/December love story set in the decrepit days just before Atlantic City's revival and done in typical Louis Malle understated style. Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon are both terrific and brew up some interesting chemistry - who'd a thunk it?"
4,"Good film, but made too soon","Good film about the Jersey Shore resort as it undergoes a metamorphosis into the gambling mecca of the East Coast. The trouble is, the movie was made when Resorts International was the only operating casino in the city. If this movie were made perhaps four years later when other houses were in operation and the gaming industry became better established, there would be much more material available to supply a rather thin plot."
5,wildfire feel the heat,It really makes you feel the agongy firefighters go through and it almost felt like i was there
2,Disappointed,"Watch band is much paler than it appears in the picture, almost washed out. I am returning the band today because it is too flimsy/thin to support my watch."
3,Mannered,"Although Bostridge performs these in the original key, and has a beautiful voice, and has a wonderful accompanist- I can't get past the mannered approach. It just doesn't flow or sound spontaneous. The exaggerated diction and dynamics sound artifical. Fischer-Dieskau- yes, a baritone, yes, not the original key- sounds so much more spontaneous and to me, does much more justice to the young, disappointed miller."
1,The Crazy Makers,"This author died of cancer in November, 2011. I found this information via Google while researching the author's dubious credentials."
5,Crazy Makers,"I am a chiropractor with a degree in nutrition and this is one of the best books I have read for lay people and professionals alike. It is well written and a fast read for busy parents. It remains focused on the topic while acknowledging there are other important facets to ones health. I highly recommend it to everyone with or without children. Laura A, Bailey D.C."
4,"Taken with a grain of salt, it's a must read!","I had heard two different radio interviews with the author and have kept an eye open for this book ever since. I'm surprised a 2nd Edition has not been released. Some of the opinions may seem radical but with so many physical and mental health problems that have no popular answers, it's good to look at some of the alternative views, and this book has them! From an increase rise in fatal food allegies like peanuts, latex, etc. to the rise in violence and poor decision making, all changes in the world must be looked at and why not start with our diet?I would like to know what the auther has learned since the book's publication and how has the scientific community reacted to this book but other than that, I give this four stars as a must read."
1,Crazy is as crazy does.,"I think the only crazy maker here is Ms Simontacchi. Yes, a small part of the book is helpful regarding nutrition, but the remainder of the book is a waste of reading time.I find it hard to respect a person who claims to be a learned professional, but in reality is nothing but. I'm also leery about the book being true to fact, as Ms Simontacchis seems to rely on her religious belief as her reseach.Facts, actual facts backed up with reference sources is what I would have liked in this book. Unfortunately, the only facts in the book are what Ms Simontacchi claims are fact."
5,The Crazy Makers: How the Food Industry Is Destroying Our Brains and Harming Our Children,"I Loved this book. I bought it on a whim at a local natural foods store and havebought a few more to give to my friends and family. It is a very complete, yet readablehandbook on all the additives, chemicals and such that is put into our foods. It is definitely something I would recommend to anyone with a passion or interest in thefoods they eat."
5,Great Book,The book is wonderful and does a great job of explaining why nutrition is so important for the brain.As a father and a professional mental health counselor that works in a public school I have seen the VERY inadequate routine that takes place in schools today when a student is having a problem. The process is basically lets get the kid to a Psychiatrist and get him on medication because it shows that the school is doing something and then relieves the school of any liability. No one questions whether the medication is good for the student or not.This book should be required reading for every school Principal and School Psychologist in the nation!
5,Crazy Makers,"Very well researched and full of valid information. This book should be required reading for every parent, there wouldn't be so many damaged brains including mine."
3,Hard to Get Close Shave,Hard to Get Close Shave. I cut myself as well when trying to get a close shave.
3,Dissapointed in this Braun,I have used Braun previously and loved it. Went to a Norelco then figured I would retry another Braun. I did not think it gave that great of a shave. Having to continually go over and over some spots to get them clean. It is still loud and the on off button being on the side is annoying. Having to sent it back to Braun was a surprise also as Amazon would not take it back before the 30 day trial was up. Think I will stick with the triple header from now on.
1,"Great for teenagers, a joke for men with real facial hair.","I'm sure this is great for peachfuzz, but real men don't have time for toys like this. Stick to your Mach3 or whatever real blades you already use. It's really a shame that these things don't really work effectively. Oh, and there's really nothing like constantly rubbing the same area of your face over and over again with harsh metal that doesn't really cut it. Stick to razors, men."
3,Foil cutter head,Bought this shaver for my dad about amonth ago. he was complaining about cutting his face & pulling his beardcloser inspection revealed the foil had gaps & holesin it cant figure out what happened to it. went to walmartbought a new head for it will see what happensHe's 90 years old says he didnt drop it or anything.
2,Bad,"I jused used this razor for the first time and was quite dissapointed. After many attempts, I still has stubble this razor cannot seem to get. Luckily I work in a factory so it doesn't matter. I'll give it another shot after I get some electric shave or something like that. For the price and the other comments, very dissapointed. Stick with the razor."
1,peice of junk,"I had high hopes when i bought this. Fancy package, catchy comercial how could it not work well.Gess what it does not work well. Tried shaving whith it severl times but I always have to clean up what it missed with a four blade razer. Sometimes it cuts sometimes it does not tried using technique spesified by directions and many other things.The only thing that seems to work is 90 degree against the grain and lots of pressure witchs causes lots of irritation.I have also tried 90 degree very slow or fast or soft.I have a very hard beard it may work if you have peach fuzz or a girly beard but if not it will cut very little and cause more irritation than a two blade razer."
3,Long-time Braun user,I was given a Braun 390cc Clean & Renew System for Christmas. It replaced a Braun 7505 shaver. This is the 4th Braun shaver I have owned in 30 years. I am disappointed in the shave it gives versus the previous shavers. The travel case has no provision for the cord and there is no cover for the head. They seem to have cut corners with this shaver.
2,Not Impressed,I would not recommend this shaver to anyone. It's fancy and high tech but doesn't give a close shave and occasionally pulls a hair instead of cutting it. Having hairs grabbed and pulled is a little painful.
4,Pining for the 1950's and 60's.,Adequate performance tho I remember the old Leonard Pennario recording with affection. The sound quality was not as good as expected from EMI so I ripped it onto my computer in WAV format and created a much better sounding product. Try it if you feel as I did about the sound quality.
2,"Not really ""bollywood""","I think that rating a DVD has to be a little different than rating a movie. I mean to say, the purchase of a DVD implies one wishes to watch a movie more than once, so the question isn't simply ""is this a good or interesting movie"" but rather, ""would I want to watch this movie more than just one time?""In the case of this movie ""Sadma,"" well, except for the slight perversity of the plot and the unhappy ending, it was indeed an interesting movie to watch - ONCE. But it's not a ""song and dance"" bollywood movie that one might want to watch over and over."
4,I LOVE THE SOUND OF NAPALM DEATH IN THE MORNING!,"Napalm Death are exactly as their name applies: harsh; brutal; scalding; and capable of murdering your eardrums! Yes, most of their songs are indistinguishable from the other, but so what? Their records are forthe pure aggression blood that runs in all of our veins! Listen to their power and feel the burn!"
1,Junk - Failed from the start,"I bought this TruTemp 3506 Oven Thermometer at Meijer (West Michigan). The FIRST one did not read above -0- in a hot oven. Its REPLACEMENT read 425 degrees for EVERY oven setting from 150 - 350. The THIRD one worked for three days, then locked on 500 degrees, even at room temperature.I used to think that a Junk was an Asian river boat, but it must be anything 'Made in China.' I'm still looking for a good oven thermometer."
1,Junk!!,Terrible product. Broken within weeks. This is what happens when a manufacturer doesn't care about quality. Don't buy it!! You will waste your money.
1,Taylor Precision Trash,"This product worked for less than a month and locked at 425 degrees. I placed it in the freezer in an attempt to unstick it; but, it is still stuck. Although the price was cheap, this product is still a rip-off. Fortunately, I still have the receipt, so I'll be returning it to the store for a refund. I'll look for another brand from now on."
4,some classic surf stuff,"this CD is a collection of a lot of classic surfing recordings made in the 60's, PLUS the last cut on the CD (Pacifica) features Los Straightjackets, who are a current band, and my favorite surf music band of today. If you like surf music, this a good collection, which includes sides by The Ventures, The Challengers, The Belairs, and others."
2,Hard to Recommend,"I am very disappointed by this CD. After being enthralled with each of the TVZ songs on Lyle Lovett's ""Step Inside this House"" CD, I was eager to get my hands on some ""real Townes"" music. I don't know what went wrong, but ""A Far Cry From Dead"" is generally listless and void of any of the magic that I hear in Lovett's covers of TVZ songs. Is this CD merely an anomaly, or are all of the TVZ CDs this ""un-listenable""? Not recommended for those wishing to ""discover"" TVZ."
1,Extremely disappointed,I purchased this CD based upon the previous reviews on this net . I am a long time TVZ fan and have the majority of his CDs. This particular one caught me off guard. It had a feel somewhat like the Joan Baez Diamonds and Rust album ...i was used to the economical instrumentation background on TVZs music and here was this 'house band' - Boston Pops type of sound. His Pancho and Lefty version sounded almost disco. I apologize for the this review but the CD has been played once and it will be recycled. I do appreciate the opportunity for this review process however.
4,wake up america !,"I've never heard it,but knowing it's from Townes it's got to be great.If the 99% of Americans that hav'nt heard ofhim would open, their minds and ears,they would realise they were missing a part of american blues history."
3,not for the TVZ purist,"the song selection is good, but the production is overdone, and overwhelms both the spare purity of his voice as well as the lyrics' intent. This is a good album to use to try to introduce your girlfriend to TVZ, but late at night, alone, perhaps with a bottle, it isn't the one I would pick."
3,Good Book on Baseball but not that great for gay content,"Billy Bean really gives you the insight on what it's like to play baseball professionally. How hard the life is with all the moving around etc. How frustrating it is to be in the majors and then sent ""back down"". His love of the game really shines through.It is a good ""gay"" book to show how hiding your identity and staying closeted really makes your life hard. How coming out is the only way to make your life complete.However I felt like Billy did not share much of his personal life about his realtionship. I did not really feel like I knew the people in his life. This was very lacking.When I was done I didn't really feel like I loved the book or would recommend it to others.It wasn't bad (like the horrible self pitying Greg Louganis book) but it wasn't great either."
2,"Stick to wielding the bat, Mr Bean!","This is a cumbersome book, poorly written. Only a Yank could arrive at such tosh. So, Mr Bean, if you are going to come out of the closet at least make it an interesting read."
1,Not what i wanted,I thought this was a cd but it ended up being a game. I did not realize it when i purchased it. I have not played it because i am not interested in playing a game. The item description could have been more clear to avoid misunderstanding
4,Finally Seeing Michael In Costume,"As a huge fan of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and especially Michael Crawford, I bought this video for his performance alone. What a singer; what an actor!! HE IS THE CONSUMATE PHANTOM! Only sorry that Steve Harley sang the title song, but it did give insight into the artistic genius that would prevail in the end. One thing that would have made this video better--""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"" continued with the trio (Phantom, Christine and Raoul)at the cemetary. If ever a video is available of the stage version of Phantom, this consumer will be the first to order!!! Also,Michael Ball was great as usual in ""Love Changes Everything""."
4,A Fine Work of Visual Music,"This video is a wonderful collection of Lloyd Webber music. However, Phantom of the Opera is horrible--new lyrics and a Phantom that cannot sing. Music of the Night and Pie Jesu are spectacular though. Sarah Brightman gives wonderful perfomances in several of the videos. I definitely recommend this video for fans of Brightman and Lloyd Webber."
4,Cheesy but the music is wonderful,"If you're a big Webber musical fan, then this is a must get video. The music is great but the videos can use a lot of work, especially ""All I Ask of You."" What was it with the clouds and the spinning and all that? It was terribly done! But I sang along anyway! Loved all the ""Joseph"" videos, especially with Jason Donovan, and I loved Michael in ""Music of the Night."" The video could have done without so much Sarah, Sarah, Sarah though. She's got a lovely voice but really!?? Wasn't this supposed to be an Andrew Lloyd Webber Video not Sarah Brightman!??"
1,Awful music videos,"I bought this video as an avid fan of Webber, but this video is ridiculous. For one thing the video has a tremendously out of date look to it. It looked more like bad kareoke videos than to any contemporary music videos. It's more like a Sarah Brightman showcase and I love Sarah but this gets out of hand with her constantly mugging through 70% of the songs. Get the Royal Albert Hall collection which is fantastic. I watch that one time and time again and yet I'm embarrassed to have this one on my shelf."
1,Sarah Brightman sings Andrew Lloyd Webber,"Well, this might as well have been titled Sarah Brightman and friends. If I hadnt loved the songs so much I would have been turned off by the cheesy videos within the first thirty seconds... Michael Crawford, Michael Ball and Jason Donovan were wonderful but whoever the genius was that told Steve Harley he could sing needs to get his/her ears checked. I recommend passing on this video and buying ""The Very Best of Andrew Lloyd Webber"" on CD which has virtually all of the same songs but you get Michael Crawford singing Phantom with Sarah."
3,Excellent Music,"I bought this video for the Phantom numbers. They were very good except for the video for 'Phantom of the Opera'. Did not like the new lyrics and Steve Harley was just awful. Very disappointing. However, 'Music of the Night' was breathtaking with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, as were the other songs from Phantom. I had never seen Michael Ball before but he was wonderful. If you're getting it to see Michael and Sarah sing 'Phantom', forget it. You'll be very disappointed. Get 'Michael Crawford In Concert'! Much better but no Sarah."
4,"Very good collection, but the videos need help","I was impressed with the singing in this video, but I must say that the video I had looked forward to the most, the ""Phantom of the Opera"" title song, was a bit dissapointing. I had expected something along the lines of what happened in the play. It was good, up until the last minute or so. I was most impressed with the portrayal of ""Music of the Night"". It was true to the play, and the acting and singing were excellent. I would recommend this video if you are more looking for good singing rather then good video footage."
3,some productions were amatuerish and distracting,Good music but the video formats varied greatly - from amatuerish to excellent - This music is best on the stage or any live format eg Prince Albert Hall - The videos were for the most part a distraction and subtracted from the music. Advice to the producers - do not do video formats unless you are willing to pay the price for quality.
2,No results,"Had great hopes for an energy boost from this product,but couldn't really tell I had taken it! Time to try something else AGAIN!"
2,save ur $$$,"Zoom-I normally use caffeine products to handle looong days. Decided to try Zoom and eliminate jitters get from caffeinated products. Not working for me at all...Vivarin cheaper/better in spite of jitters, so save ur money..."
2,No Zoom,"The Zoom didn't work for me. I didn't feel any kind of difference. I didn't get a sick feeling from it(which is good),but I didn't get a boost of energy either. The pills are big,and don't taste to good!"
2,propaganda,"Most Americans (and this movie) conflate two different things: (1) whether a person's homeland is unjust, cruel, etc. and (2) whether the U.S. is required to take them in because of this.Every decent person would recognize the cruelty of the Taliban. Does it follow that we are obligated to take in this person? Why did she not emigrate to Pakistan where the people practice the same religion, etc.? Why does it have to be America?This movie sends a message loud and clear: America should make its immigration policy even more lax after 9/11 than it was before. This is spelled out in the text messages at the end of the movie. Unfortunately, most Americans agree. The fact that it was this lax admissions policy that made 9/11 possible is lost on this movie and on the moviemakers.The consequences of this policy are yet to come, but they are building steadily every day."
4,"Good ""dollhouse"" for boys","My son loves play houses, but since they are all geared towards little girls I thought this would be a good sub. He got it from Santa and was very pleased! I don't understand how it would take anyone over 45 minutes to put it together, because it's really just about 5 or 6 pieces that need to be screwed into pre-made holes. It was very simple, and though we've only had it for a couple days it's held up to my son's insistence that the fire alarm rings so loudly the whole station shakes and the furniture flies out.My only complaint so far is that the men are really, really ugly and don't even have pants on. We already had a couple firemen that I threw in there, but will be replacing the ones it came with. They are seriously hideous to look at! Also, the ladder that extends doesn't so much extend on the truck as it comes in two pieces, and you can stack one piece on the other to make it longer."
3,Where are their pants?,"I think this toy is very cute. I don't think it was difficult to put together, I say this knowing i put a piece in backwards and let it stay that way... but my biggest problem is that in every picture of this item, the fireman are wearing black pants. The ACTUAL firemen that came with it aren't wearing any pants. Their legs are pale like their faces, not black like the pictures.. so frankly, to be a prude... I have two half naked firemen for my kids to play with. Happy YMCA Christmas for us."
2,fire station falls apart!,"While this fire station IS difficult to put together, when my little guy saw it, he loved it! However, the fire truck pieces fell off within an hour of first being played with. Other pieces of the fire station also began falling off. While this is a great idea, it seems to be very cheaply put together. For $100, I would definitely not buy this toy again!"
1,Beware!,"What they don't tell you is that this ""toy"" has to be assembled BY YOU. WITH A PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER. Yes, the fire station does have that quaint ""homemade"" look, because YOU, the parent, will be building it. The screw holes are vaguely indicated; in some places, they aren't even broken into the wood. You do that yourself. If you've got a COUPLE HOURS, a phillips head screwdriver and are in good shape, you'll love preparing this toy. Just don't wait until Christmas Eve to get started."
5,Terrific Firehouse,"Last Christmas I bought this toy for my then three-year-old grandson. He loves it. This year I purchased it for his cousin, my two-year-old grandson. Assembly of both was a 20-minute snap. The toy is sturdy and well-made. Last year's firehouse, which has had much use, looks as good as the new one. The fire engine and other accompanying pieces are extensive in number, sturdy, and provide much imaginative play for young children. The turn table base allows for easy access. I highly recommend this toy. One interesting note: Last year I paid $100; this year I paid $60."
5,"2, 4, 6, 8 ......","Some 20 years ago, I left off coaching Little League baseball because of the same type of attitudes shown in this movie. Although billed as a comedy, to my mind The Bad News Bears is equally a cautionary tale - it should be required viewing for all Little League coaches and parents. Hey folks, see yourselves here? Oh well, a word to the wise (and enjoy this movie)!"
5,MMM,Great movie I love the transformation coach buttermaker does in the championship game when he realizes it is just a game and lets everyone plays 5 star movie in my book
1,Bad News Bears,"The whole cast was great, but Vic Morrow and Walter Matthau were the whole movie. Vic Morrow was the greatest actor of our time. He was also a very good looking man. He was born in the Bronx like I was (that made him very special to all of usBronxites) and we are proud of one of own kind that did so well.I give the movie a five star."
2,WORST LANGUAGE EVER - do not allow children to watch.,"Could not believe the language. Every swear, and I mean, Every swear possible ... except the F-word, but including the N-word! Also other derogatory and racist words for hispanics and jewish people. G-D this, G-D that. Constant Beer Swilling (every scene). This would NEVER make it past today's censors! If it did, it would be rated R for language. Not exaggerating... feel free to check it out.. but watch it BEFORE you allow your kids to see it.Also, not a positive role model (kid getting smacked down by his dad, and worse) Kids that are too wise to adult concepts and talk freely about them.Not for children. This isnt the 70s."
2,I'm glad my little league is not like this.,"This is not a good movie for kids. There was a lot of bad language, and there was a lot of yelling and people were angry.But, at the end, I liked where the team that beat the Bears apologized for being mean to the Bears throughout the season. That is the reason that I gave the movie two stars."
2,No Longer a Classic,"I once thought this was a good movie, but that was in a different era. It had probably been about 15 years since I had last seen this movie, so when I watched it recently I was amazed at what a horrible person Matthau's character was -- verbally and physically abusive to children. I still recognize the elements that I had always considered funny, but in today's world I found this primarily to be a very dark movie -- not something I'd want my own child to watch."
4,Fun,"This is an older movie about a coach and a raggle taggle baseball team of young boys. They don't really play very well and the coach drinks. He changes and they change. They get two really good players who help their team to make it to the finals. The things I liked about this film. I wished I could have played baseball as well as Tatum. I loved her way of dealing with life, she was so young but manifested the things she wanted. I liked her connection with Buttermaker. He was kind of like her dad. They had fun together, cleaning pools, practicing, eating pizza. I think the main thing is just the fun she had with her life doing her ballet, playing baseball with people who seemed safe most of the time, doing creative jobs, dressing interesting, and just having fun."
5,Classic worth owning,This is a classic worth owning. I remember the movie well as a kid and I bought it for my 8 yr old after the Billy Bob version came out. The Walter Matthau classic is much better.
1,Bad News Bears,"Bad News Bears, It was the wrong movie as on the box it had walter Mathul and that was what I ordered but, the movie inside was of Billy Bob Thornton which is a awful movie for my Grandson."
2,ok,"Came in good shape, but can't hear the talking at all. Even turned up all the way, very hard to understand, static."
5,Bad News Bears,"The whole cast was great, but Vic Morrow and Walter Matthau were the whole movie. Vic Morrow was the greatest actor of our time. He was also a very good looking man. He was born in the Bronx like I was (that made him very special to all of usBronxites) and we are proud of one of our own kind that did so well.I give the movie a five star."
5,Its a baseball classic,My wife is not from the US and when I started talking more and more about baseball she watched this film with me. Now she understands. This is far better than the Billy Bob version. As a kid I loved this movie and as an adult I still do.
4,Long live the spirit of Tanner Boyle,"As close as a sport movie gets to what I remember about growing up and playing on a team. Forget about Remember the Titans or other Disney fare. This shows kids who fight and cuss and do things that kids do. Tanner Boyle reminds me of so many kids growing up (short and maybe not that tough, but won't back down from nobody). What was Linklater thinking with the remake? Captured none of the spirit of the first movie (and I really like most of his other stuff). A team of mostly outcasts and misfits is the only team I ever want to join."
5,Proper breathing has a major impact on your health,"I have been suffering with a fatiguing illness for several years and have tried just about everything. I picked up Ken Cohen's Healthy Breathing on a lark and was so glad I did. This very easy to follow audio tape enables you to determine if you are breathing properly, and offers quick and easy exercises that will help you to make the most out of every breath you take! I won't say it has been a ""cure"" but it sure has helped!! Happy Breathing!"
4,Extremely helpful book,"I am a very good skater. this book has explanations for every trick known, along with plans for a half-pipe, quarter pipe, vert wall, and Launch ramp. It gives u saftey instructions and has some phat photo's."
4,"Spacey, surreal, dreamy","Ballard repeats, develops, and resolves his ideas about the psychological impact of space-travel and the temptation of breaking out of the constraints of Time. It's almost like watching someone hone a chess game, moving similar characters around in a similar fashion, but the small changes make all the difference...The reader is consoled for the narrative similarities by some of Ballard's most vivid imagery--sun-bleached aviators and the Cubist beauty of a world released from the fourth dimension. Two stories break away from this somewhat; one is a journey into the Amazon jungle in search of a downed spacecraft that gives a nod to Conrad's Heart of Darkness. In addition, the last story in the anthology, unusually down to earth (for Ballard) and set in an unnamed tropical/South American location, seems almost like a collaboration between Ballard and--possibly--Ray Bradbury. A worthwhile read for a Ballard fan, a touch challenging for other readers."
2,Items don't cook evenly,"This baking sheet is very heavy duty which I like. The problem is that when I make cookies they seem to cook more on the bottom, but they are not ready on the top. If I keep them in the oven though then the bottom will be burnt. Maybe I am doing something wrong, but it is at the point where I can't even use this for baking cookies."
2,Stained and burns,"Maybe it's just user error, but this pan has not been pleasant to bake with. It cooks too fast on the bottom and also stains very easily. Again, maybe it was my error, but that hasn't happen to my other cookie sheets. I really had high hopes for this sheet and it has failed me. Boo =("
4,Came with no tape on packaging (twice) and missing most sticks,Came with no tape on packaging (twice) and missing most sticks the first time. Amazon did replace but come on Amazon NO tape on both boxes.
4,Can't Find These At The Dollar Store,Great value work great for making repairs to old sunvisors that were falling apart. You will have to work at finding a better deal.
4,Just what I needed...,"This package is larger than I thought it was, but it is exactly what I was looking for. This brand of glue works well. I dont have any problems with the glue not sticking well."
4,4 corners' sound has American roots,"4 corners is excellent! I have been fan of Bluey since the first Incognito release. The compositions and performances of incognito/innershade remind me of those incredible American popular jazz writers and ""musical"" groups of the late seventies. It is apparent that younger audiences of today also enjoy talented composers and musicians. Come on American producers-we invented this style of music, lets continue the tradition."
5,4 Corners is incognito at its best,"4 Corners is a CD that you can listen to without wanting to skip past certain tracks. I'm an incognito fan, and took a chance on an Inner Shade purchase, however I was not disappointed. It has the overall sound of post ""100 degrees and rising"" Incognito (No Big Horns). My favorite tracks are ""Little Sunflower"", and ""mood to mood"". The ""4 Corners"" track reminds me of a song on Nuyorican Soul's CD ""I am the black gold of the sun"". So... if you like your music with a mixture of jazz and funk, with a touch of Maysa's vocals, I think that you will like this CD."
4,"There's No ""Right"" in Writing","If I had read this as a young teen, I would have probably become a writer. It's funny,imaginative,and completely original. Everyone's voice counts in this classroom, and they are all as different as fingerprints. Get it for a kid you know...especially one who doesn't think writing is cool."
2,reader be warned,"I only read the first five chapters, so this is not a full review of the book. The writing and plot seem good enough but the reader will find foul language and explicit sex within the first 27 pages. Just a bit surprised to get this in a book endorsed by Laura Ingraham."
2,graphic realism,"The writer reminds me of Tom Wolf in his graphic writing style. Klavan became a Christian and his writing took on redemptive characteristics. But think Flannery O'Connor and don't assume a sanitized text. Human nature's not pretty. The narrator describes himself as ""a penis with some human personality attached"" and meets a girl (Emily) he falls in love with at first sight. He is then seduced by his boss and begins an affair with her. His redemption comes when he breaks it off with his boss and gets beaten to a pulp in an effort to ""become a better man"" for Emily's sake."
3,THIS BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN TITLED OBSESSION,"PLOT LINE: A 50ish, overweight but intuitive San Francisco P.I. named Weiss is obsessed with finding and eliminating a professional killer known as The Shadowman, who considers himself to be ""smarter under fire"" than his adversaries. He, in turn, is obsessed with an unbelievably beautiful prostitute named Julie, who he once nearly killed, and now is determined to find her so he can finish the job. Got the picture?There is also another individual in Weiss's office who has an obsession of his own and this lends a lot of humanity to the tale, not to mention themes such as loyalty, discovery and humor.I did wince a couple of times at the brutality in certain chapters, but must admit I was never bored."
1,A cheap book with a horrible translation,"I just ordered this edition of The Double because it was simply cheap. When I started reading it, I realized the many typos and horrible grammar. There are times where I'm not sure what is going on because the translation is so poor at telling this story. Do not buy this translation. It's not worth wasting your time on. Instead I will have to delete this version and buy a different one with a more competent translator. All of this because they were too cheap to actually get a professional translator."
2,Digiread edition is FULL OF TYPOS,"Physically, it's a nice enough little book, and the paper looks to be acid-free. But there seems to have been *no* effort at proofing it. Digiread is willing to take money for a book that they were unwilling to spend money proofreading. It's bizarrely shoddy work, and I think this says a lot about the company. I emailed them about it, but they did not write back. My impression is that they really don't give a damn -- not about literature, not about their customers, and not about the quality of their product.Kind of a shame, really -- it's a great little novel. :(The Double"
1,Typos,"I would not recommend this particular book. In the first 11 pages there were 4 typos. (I have not read further yet). When I read, I immerse myself into the story line and when a typo pops up it not only takes away from the meaning but it is also very distracting.I would perhaps recommend buying from a different publisher."
2,On The Double,"Should I blame Borges (""The Other""), Conrad (""The Secret Sharer""), Gogol (""The Nose"") or Poe (""William Wilson"")? I honestly don't know. All I can say is that the short works of these authors, all four of them, will stay with me far, far longer than Dostoyevsky's The Double."
4,This Book is NOT Written in the First Person......,.....despite what certain illustrious reviews may tell you. It makes you wonder if they even actually read the book.
5,A novel way ahead of its time,"The Double was Dostoyevskys second book. The author thought it was his greatest work yet, but to the literary critics, who considered it weird and insane, it was a disappointment. This was not strange, because D. had really started to explore new territories of the human mind. The language and style was close to that of Gogol, but what D. wrote here was simply revolutionary! He describes insanity from within, a person who is followed by a double through the cold streets of StPetersburg. It's no wonder this book amazed Freud and the psycho-analysts of the 20th century. You can also clearly see who Kafka learned from... However, this is a great book and it is invaluable if you want to get further into the genius of Fyodor Dostoyevsky."
5,good intro to Dostoyevsky,"I read one of Dostoyevsky's longer novels a few years ago and I got lost in it - a lot of names, really long, and confusing writing. The Double, I think is also a difficult read to the casual reader (like me) - it is a hazy line between fantasy and reality in The Double as other reviewers have aptly noted. But it is short (comparably at least) and the characters are easily discernible. I didn't follow everything, but enough to enjoy it. And enough to give me confidence to tackle his other short stories and then Brothers.As I believe is true of many of Dostoyevsky's characters, you will see traces of yourself in Golyadkin senior and junior - in the insecurities and indecisiveness to name a couple of his traits. For that reason, The Double is not only a interesting story but also a piece that forces the reader to introspect."
1,"A Horrible Translation of ""The Double""","I strongly advise against ordering this particular translation. It is awkward and deviates significantly from the original text. In addition, there are several typographical errors throughout the book. Since the translator isn't even listed, I'd be willing to bet the translation is so old it's out of copyright."
5,Emmylou ain't no Grandma Gone South on Us,"Breathless. I am in awe of the mystical powers of Emmylou Harris' incomparable vocal style and taste for gut-wrenching material. Her cuts from Wrecking Ball are even more haunting here in the live format, especially and essentially in the context of samplings of her body of work. I listen to this CD over and over, and each time, something new catches my ear, much the same as a good film or novel. A classic. Timeless and oh, so fine."
2,Such a disappointment...,"I love Emmylou and hoped that this finally(!) new release would provide my next Emmylou fix since ""Wrecking Ball."" To be truthful, I guess I really bought it for the new version of ""Love Hurts"" and was not disappointed with that one song, which was as soulful and gut wrenching as anything she did with Gram Parsons. But I did not care for any of the other songs, mostly remakes of songs better covered in earlier works. I guess if you're touring with a rock band it's hard not to give them space, but they drown out and overshadow Emmylou's beautiful voice and style. Hoping Emmylou will return to her roots...the soil is as rich, friable and fertile as it's ever been for her gift!"
5,Truly Out Front Of The Crowd,"Emmylou Harris' new album entitled Spyboy is a wonderful live album that gives us every indication that Emmylou is still growing and moving on to new heights. While the album is mostly old songs done live, it is refreshing to hear ""I Ain't Living Long Like This"" and ""Deeper Well"" played by Buddy Miller, Daryl Johnson and Brady Blade. This band really compliments the singer. ""Wrecking Ball"" was a big step for Emmylou and I, for one, thought it was a wonderful new direction. This album shows that a live album can make the listener wish he or she was there and indeed is there. If this is any indication of Emmylou's continued ""new direction"" I will be here to applaud her all the way. All of the alternative and progressive stations should be playing this album on a regular basis."
2,shouldn't have been released,"This was recorded on an off night, and Emmylou's voice is not in peak condition. Also, because ""Wrecking Ball"" -- the album that got me interested in current Emmylou -- was recorded for another label, many of those songs could not be released on this album as planned.Around this time Harris with the Spyboy band were doing really smoking renditions of the Wrecking Ball material. If you can find a copy of her Tonight Show appearance where they did ""All My Tears"", and compare it with the recording of that same song here, you'll get an idea of what an amazing live album might have been made under more fortunate circumstances. Hopefully better material from this period will be bootlegged. In more recent performances her band has become considerably tamer.I don't think this album would work for fans of ""more traditional"" country either, but I wouldn't know about such tastes.N.B. ""Born To Run"" is not the Bruce Springsteen song."
2,"Emmylou is one of the greats. Sadly, this album is not!","There are a few kinds of music that Emmylou sings that don't work. This album has them all. The tunes are banal and she is trying to make her voice carry them. If you'd like to hear Michael Bolton sing country-folk, you might like this album."
4,Mistake in artist info?,"I love several tracks off this album, however, I noticed track 10 - Stardust sounds exactly the same as the one played by Nini Rosso, but here it says Serge Valentino was the player. The two tracks are the exact same! Am I missing something here? Or is this simply a collection of trumpet music from various artists?"
3,all good,video arrived as scheduled. in good working/watching condition. no complaints here.no scratches on disc. and ready to watch once received.l
5,GOOD MOVIE,"ENJOYED THE MOVIE, INTERESTING INTURRUPTATION OF HISTORY?HAD SEX, LOVE, GREED, & DRAMA ALL IN ONE MOVIE, WHAT ELSE COULD YOU WANT."
4,A Breast Above the Rest,"This is a fun film, featuring some quick, snappy writing. If you love films that span the decades and include plenty of pop culture spin, while based in some fact (even if it takes some liberties now and then) ie. think a la ""Boogie Nights"" and ""The People V.S. Larry Flynt,"" you'll like this film.Great production values and David Schwimmer is fun in this feature film breakout role as he was preparing for his post-""Friends"" career. Chris Cooper is a stellar standout, as usual.Of course, it goes without saying, be aware there's lots of above the waist female nudity.- - Philip Potempa, The Times Newspaper of Indiana/Illinois"
2,"Not a very good film, i like the history but a bit boring, however i am a fan of Schwimmer",Is nice but at times a bit boring. The history in the film is good but a bit slow at times.
5,Worth the money,If you've never sold before or have no clue what you're doing this is great. He can be repetitive but all in all I give an A+
5,Joe Girard Complete Audio Box Set CD,Extremely helpful.. I bought this to learn Joe Girard's views on sales. I felt his presentation so worthwhile that I am passing it around the company for several employees to listen to.
1,Out of Date and Narrow in Scope,"In my opinion this book is out of date and specific to retail car sales. The tips in this book may be applicable to selling cars in 1970-80; however, in this decade, people buy cars because they have strong research done, not because the car sales person is the greatest sales guy in town. I do not think you can find any tips in this book specific to selling products in the corporate setting (business to business sales)."
2,so-so,I had the original cassette that Joe made and it is much better than these cd's. He didn't sound like himself--to much editing from outside sources.
3,helpful hints,Enjoyed the CD's the content was interesting but his voice was not enjoyable to listen to. Would recomend any one in sales to purchase. Had some good ideas.
1,Glass carafe,This coffee maker is great but I am on my third glass carafe. The first one I bumped it on the faucetand it broke. The second one I bumped it on the stove and it just shattered. It is very thin glass and you have to be very very careful too careful. I am going to go with another maker I am tired of replacing this one.
5,Phantom Rock The Planet !,I love this - Fantastic Album of catchy songs you find yourself humming over & over again.I have just one question - when is your next album released guys?
5,Can someone help re: Phantom Planet track?,"Can any fan offer tips on where to get PPs track 'the In Crowd', which appeared on ""drive me Crazy"" movie but not in CD of that soundtrack..I also cannot see it on their albums..please email pfarnell@optusnet.com.auT/Y."
2,Phantom Planet is missing ...something,"Why do bands described with adjectives like ""Beatle-esque"",""clever"",and ""melodic"" almost always end up sounding like poor imitations of Squeeze? Same goes for ""Phantom Planet Is Missing"". Preciousness should never be mistaken for cleverness. Check out Teenage Fanclub for the exception to the rule."
1,The worst album I ever owned,I recently bought this CD and it was the worst mistake I had ever made. The songs aren't catchy and the hype surrouding the band is just that: hype.My tip to you is to save your money.
1,I know people only look at the bad ratings so....,"I'm giving this album one star for on cool collection! Wow! Isn't this nice? I was also wondered if any of you out there know where to look for the lyrics to the songs, since they aren't included in the album? If anyone know, drop me a line! Thanks!"
5,finally a cd where allllllllll the songs are great!!!,"what can i say,these guys are simply awesome,they are not to heavy and not too light.but all the songs are great and ever since i bought it it hasnt come out of my player.definitely a cd to buy right now."
4,Great late teen soundtrack,"These guys could use a little bit of help with their lyrics, but they have energy and wit way ahead of alot of bands this age like Eve 6, Days of the New. Could also take a cue from some Ben Folds 5 (who they ""borrow"" from) and infuse punk pacing on some songs. Max Fischer is a great drummer, and they have some extremely talented guitarists. I hope on the next cd they can have one producer (and maybe a video) to give them a good direction on their music."
5,phantom planet is missing,"Plantom Planet is Missing balances the explosive energy of youth-most of the members are barely in their 20s-with the skill and polish of experienced soundsmiths. The songs fuse a classic, melody-driven musicality with an identifiably '90s point of view; the influences of Queen, ELO and the Beach Boys complete the picture. Paul Fox (XTC, Sugarcubes) co-produced."
1,Very shoddy--didn't last 6 months!,"Though pretty, these flip flops were very poorly made. The sequins started to come off immediately (some had already come off in the box when it arrived; a few more showed up on the floor each week. The stem that divides the big toe from the others started to fall apart to the point that the flip flops became completely unusable after 6 months. And this was only with moderate wear, primarily around the house! Avoid this product!"
2,Thank God for Joel Schumacher!,"After watching/listening to Antonio Banderas struggle through his Phantom of the Opera I can only say how grateful I am that Joel Schumacher chose Gerard Butler to be our Phantom instead of Banderas who vigorously campaigned for the film role. Zorro can't sing. Not at all. And his aging cherub's face is not sexy and it is not menacing. I'm glad he took his mask, his cape and his sword to another movie set. Butler was extraordinary, evidenced by the fact that the film soundtrack went platinum!Butler's Phantom was everything I hoped it would be. Incredibly sexy,cunning,murderous,childlike,sympathetic, and quite mad."
3,"Loved the ballads, disliked the jazzy numbers.","I really enjoyed the ballads with Sarah Brightman, Antonio Bandaras, Elaine Paige, Donny Osmond, and Michael Ball, and others, but truly disliked the upbeat and jazzy numbers a lot. A mixed bag to be sure!"
5,A great DVD,"As popular as its airing on Public Television some years ago, this DVD is sure to give one many hours of enjoyment for years to come. It is a masterful performance. It is about the best anthology of Andrew Lloyd Webber in one album that one can own. Also, you get the best-known performers."
5,awesome musical concert,"Celebration, what a wonderful collection of music; if you like ""CATS"" and ""Joseph's Coat of Many Colors"" you will also enjoy this collection of music. The artists are spectacular !!!!! Well worth the money."
3,I HAVE WAITED 2 YEARS FOR THIS TO HIT DVD-,"ok...in short this is an AWSOME MUST HAVE PERFORMANCE FOR THE WEBBER FAN. but sadly, the quality of the recording is very poor....sound goes up and down all by itself. sound is clear, but the quality of the surround sound encoding is awful. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED. My advice? dont buy---wait until they come out with a ""second edition"" because this is an embarasement to andrew lloyd webber. <and yes if someone i didnt know would have told me this i wouldnt have believed them either...so i bought it too > i hear the VHS version is also poorly recorded...."
5,Happy Birthday Andrew,"A wonderful compilation of Andrew Lloyd Webber standards and some lesser known works as well. Andrew's 50th birthday party will be celebrated for years to come thanks to the DVD. Thank you Andrew for your relentless efforts, your vision, your music. And happy birthday, to all of us."
3,No credits given...,"I don't know if my copy is different from the others, but I did not receive any printed material with the DVD identifying the artists, etc. The music, sets, images, were great, but aside from the ""biggies"", I could not tell the names of the performers! There must have been a playbill, so why no credits with this DVD? The song titles are on the back cover, but nothing else. Big big disappointment... It was like seeing the live performance with half a brain..."
5,A MUST OWN!,"This video inspires our family to tears frequently. There are spiritual messages in nearly every song. A great way to prepare your soul for the cold, dark days of the Y2K Depression, soon to befall us all. Listen to the words of God through ""Just One Look"" Enjoy!"
3,Review...,"The only dark moment in the video was Antonio Banderas. He couldn't even pronounce the words right, nontheless sing with emotion. OTherwise, the concert was great...Michael Ball, Glenn Close were excellent...Michael Crawford, however, should have been there."
5,Incredible performances. Michael Ball at his BEST!,"This collection is a must have for all Webber fans. This ""Celebration"" reintroduced me to the magnificent power of Michael Ball. His performance of Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say) is the most moving rendition I have ever heard. His presence on stage is magical. His single silouhette fills the entire stage. He alone is reason enough to add this to your collection. Donny Osmond is great. Elaine page as Evita is superb. Michael Crawford was sorely missed. Antonio Banderas is suprisingly good but not able to fill Mr. Crawfords shoe's as the Phantom. If you love Andrew Lloyd Webber you will Love spending two hours enraptured by his genius."
5,WOW!,Excellent video. Captures many great performances featuring all of the works of Andrew's except Jeeves and Tell me on a Sunday...I wonder why? Some of the editing is obvious (people disappear off of the stage too quickly) I question why Antonio Banderas performed the role of the Phantom in the Phantom of the Opera portion- were none of the other Phantoms available? Too busy smashing chandeliers I suppose. Overall a very entertaining video that you will want to share!
4,Whistle down with Tina!!!,"The first time I watched this Andrew Lloyd Webber special is that I have been very impressed with the cast. All the big names from Europe down to America is present with the likes of Glen Close to Antonio Banderas! big and a shiny production I must say. The opening number titled ""Whistle Down The Wind"" was honourably given to the gorgeous and ever so talented Tina Arena! She gave a powerhouse performance all looking sultry and sexy in a gray figure hugging lacy gown. She gave a strong performance and the crowd was obviously delighted with her interpretation! The vocals and the emotion are so evident. Encore for Tina Arena!!! Other internationals include Boyzone, Michael Ball, and Bonnie Tyler and gave justifying performances as well. But the highlight ofcourse would be Tina's rendition of ""Whistle Down The Wind"". Great move for Monsieur Webber to have Tina open the show! very impressive! Go get the video NOW!"
1,old,"the sound quality and picture quality is too old on this one. ya, the collection is nice - but it is meant to play on old dvd players and the big glass television sets. current systems and flat panel displays either expose the weakness in the recording. a CD would have sufficed, for the collection of songs is very nice and unique."
4,Liked Most of it,"I really enjoyed it. Sara Briteman was excelent, unfortunetly Antonio Banderes Did not do well trying to sing the Phantom of the Opera. All in all, this wasn't to bad."
5,too good to be true,"Lloyd Webber is the best!!!!!!!!!!! Sarah Brightman, in my opinion, sang better in other CDs for Pie Jesu and Hosanna was freaky but if you haven't heard her sing, listen for awhile to some CDs. Her voice grows on you. Evita's coreography was COOL. It was moving, powerful, and intense. Actually no surprises there, it's Elaine Paige and Antonio Banderas, need anyone say more. Joseph was perfect, Jesus Christ superstar- I wanted to see Everything's all right! Still, good. There's a Light at the End of the Tunnel was so good, roller skate dancers were fun to see. When everyone sang Love Changes Everything...BUY THIS!"
5,Beautiful music.,I purchased this for my father and he listens to it constantly. Its so comforting for him and I enjoy hearing it as well.
5,"Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray...",Are they ever going to release a blu-ray version of this superb concert? If there is ever a concert market crying out for a B-ray version it's this one.
5,Glorious !,I bougth this DVD three times because I had to give two as gift for family. Everybody loved it. Several memorable performances! Glenn Close in Sunset Boulevard is the best!
5,Andrew Lloyd Webber's 50th Birthday Party Bash,"This DVD will be among the most cherished DVD's I own. Being a great fan of ALW's music and his incredible talent, it was not difficult to rate. Each of the songs from his musicals were featured with the original cast artists, which made it even more enjoyable. Phantom of the Opera, Cats, Jesus Christ Superstar, Whistle Down the Wind, Aspects of Love, etc. - there is no duplicating these voices - Michale Ball, Elaine Paige, Sara Brightman - an era of music that will be long enjoyed by those who appreciate wonderful music."
4,Andrew Lloyd Webber - The Royal Albert Hall Celebration,"Very good and longer than the one on PBS. We especially liked the songs from ""The Phanthom of the Opera."""
5,Please release this on Blu-ray!,"The concert itself is phonomenal! However, the DVD looks bad on my HD TV but most of all the audio is pretty weak with the compressed dolby surround (No LPCM track provided). It would be great to watch the stunning concert in HD even though the screen ratio has to be 1.33:1 and also with uncompressed pure audio. I know blu-ray will make huge difference and this title deserves it!"
5,A great sampling of Webber's music,"Although I usually prefer classical music or pre-1950s popular music, I do enjoy the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. This is a very good sampling from his musicals. My only complaint is that some of the singing is not as good as it should be. Except for the opening number which was poorly sung, it sounded OK until I heard Sarah Brightman and Kiri Te Kanawa towards the end of the concert. Then I realized how much better this concert would have been if it had all been sung by singers of their skills."
5,Wonderful Tribute!,"I have always caught bits and pieces of this celebration on PBS, and I cannot wait to enjoy the whole performance when I get the video! Of course, Andrew Llyod Webber's music is wonderful (that goes without saying!), but the performers are the best part of this! Michael Ball is AMAZING! If you like him, check out the Les Mis dream cast recording (another GREAT live performance!). The other performers (Kiri Te Kawana is awesome!) are excellent as well. I am so glad I will finally have the chance to see this all the way through. This is a must have for anyone who enjoys Webber's work. Superb!"
5,WEBBER LOVERS DELIGHT,"FAST PACED AND WELL DONE. ENJOY IT ON AT WORK, COSTOMERS WAITING TO CHECK OUT WATCH AND COMMENT ON HOW GREAT HIS MUSIC IS. BRAVO"
3,Think Cliff Notes for Pop-theater,"A pretty good review of pretty good pop-theater. Sarah Brightman is wonderful as always, Glenn Close is better than expected. Be sure to watch the credits at the end. Lottie Mayor is the highlight of the show with ""Whistle Down the Wind"". Outshining Sarah Brightman is a tough assignment, but Ms. Mayor is a show stopper. A good video for people who don't go to the theater, but want to see the hightlights."
5,"Amazing Cast, Amazing Music, Breathtaking Performances","I saw the advertisements for this video off of the Cats home video. The next day I went and bought it. I love Elaine Page and Michael Ball. They have truely talented voices. Tina Arena gives a wonderful performance as well. I thought that Bonnie Tyler was an odd add in, her talent wasn't quite up to par with some of the rest. Antonio Banderas does wonderfully in Evita but shouldn't touch Phantom, he does very well but I still think of the phantom as Michael Crawford. But otherwise Antonio is wonderful in the show as well. I watch this video all the time, I just wish that they would have done a little more on Cats. I recommend this video on surround sound turned up really loud, and get comfy, it will blow your socks off!!!!! Hearing these performers live is the neatest thing you will ever hear, and I haven't heard anything like it in the USA. Go Buy it now before you forget."
2,Birthday Celebration,"The show starts with a very nice rendition by Donny Osmond from ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat."" The Phantom of the Opera songs were disappointing. Mr. Bandares struggled through the songs but Sarah Brightman was able to lend her beautiful voice to save the songs in part. For the most part the video is enjoyable if the listener does not expect the usual power and passion of Andrew Lloyd Webber music."
4,SOME OF MY FAVORITES HERE!,"There are a few performances on this DVD that I could live without, but the ones I do like are excellent. Donny Osmond - Joseph (good songs - performed well). Antonio Banderas - Evita (quite good). Glenn Close and her dramatics from Sunset Blvd - wow! Boyzone - yes a boy band (No Matter What - a terrific song) - good job and great voices. But the most excellent and my favorites here are from Michael Ball - boy I wish I could sing like him. Excellent voice and great stage presence. What a performer. Not many can hold a candle to him. Great DVD overall - buy it now and be prepared to be entertained."
3,Something was missing...........,"I saw this DVD and would buy it for my collection except for ONE THING.WITHOUT MICHAEL CRAWFORD, it just isn't ""complete Webber"". Sorry Antonio!"
1,Gray Perm Rods,"These perm rods SUCK. The rubberbands on them are already stretched out, and they are overpriced. Just go to your local beauty store. Do not buy these POS perm rods!"
3,Goes down quick and easy,"I love historical mysteries. This one is not quite in the league of Caleb Carr's The Alienist, and it's less cerebral than The Dante Club, but definitely an enjoyable light read that I recommend to fans of the genre and fans of Charles Dickens."
2,bad handle,"I love Fiestaware (that accounts for the two stars) but can't stand these mugs. The tiny loop handle requires you to thread one finger through and rest the rest of your fingers or hand on the cup -- hello, if I wanted to hold a hot cup in my hand, I wouldn't get a mug with a handle on it.Take a look at the handle on the big cup, Fiestafolk, and take a hint. Now THAT'S a handle."
4,Meh.,"These are the most bizarre coffee mugs I've ever owned. Yeah, they look really neat, but the ""handle"" is just a little circle that's hard to grip.If you like holding your coffee mug with just your index finger and spilling the contents all over the place, this is the mug for YOU!The capacity is very small, too. All of my other mugs hold a good deal more than these.I wouldn't buy these particular mugs now that I've had them (they were a gift!) nor would I give them as a gift to anyone else. Does Fiestaware make another kind of mug? Maybe they're better-designed than these ones."
1,"Love the dinnerware, hate the mugs!","The design of the mug handles is such that one cannot drink hot liquids without burning the skin of the fingers that are inside the handle. If I could replace just the mugs, I'd be a happy camper."
3,An oddity worth checking out,"He discusses at length how opposing players would try to rattle him by snapping a rubber band he would customarily wear on his wrist.Of an early coach he had who claimed he could ""handle"" his players, Wilt averred: ""You handle horses. You don't handle players. You work with players.""He revels us with tales of driving from coast to coast while chugging large bottles of 7-Up. After learning he can't fit into the sports car of his dreams, he weeps.He named one of his dogs Kareem. The book contains plenty of pictures, too, mostly of his ostentatious home."
1,Think again about Ed Asner,"His agenda is simply hating any one who doesn't think just like himself. He is not a cordial man, but a sour, bitter liberal who will never get over that the American people put their votes in to elect George W. Bush for two terms. If you look on the back cover of Misuse of Power at the two faces pictured there, Ed Asner and his writing partner, Burt Hall, ask your self who would you trust to save you if you were drowning? Even though, I don't personally share Burt Hall's political philosophy, I would trust him to try his best to save me from the whirl pool, not Mr. Asner..."
3,Fun Little Game,I bought it for my 5 and 7 year old boys. Surprisingly they still pull it out from time to time. it's fun. I like the fact that you don;t actually have control over the outcome so it's always a surprise. It packs well too.
1,this is nothing new,This is not true magick. it is a man made form. It is just another neo-paganism or wicca book.
2,Elitest?,"Obviously skilled in her practice, the author really gets her hands dirty with this book. The only problem I have with this book is that, well, I just didn't understand what she was talking about. I've read many books about general practice and little about theory and, as the name of the book suggests with the inclusion of the word ""theory,"" I expected to learn something about the theory of ""witchcraft."" I just didn't. It seemed like she was trying to be abstract and mysterious while battling the need to be technical and explanatory. I felt, throughout the book, that she was being creatively fictional (and not the inspirational kind) rather than paying attention to the mission of the book. Teach the reader about theory in a way that invites the public rather than a way that nurtures a mere minority!"
2,"...something borrowed, something blue.","Nothing really new here. Essentially this book is comprised of common ""outer-court"" Gardnerian material mixed heavily with mystical Hebrew concepts found in the Kaballah. It also contains a fair amount of non-Craft ""self-help"" style material, which appears to be the only original stuff contributed by the author.If you have a couple of beginner's books already, then you have most of the material this book contains. The only difference is that this book is written with a bit more maturity than most Llewellyn books and is therefore not as sickly sweet."
1,Please don't waste your money!!,I do not usually do bad reviews as i find that my tastes may be different from others but this book is such a travesty i can't not write this review. Where oh Where should i start? Wow i bought this book thinking that it would be different from other 101 books well i was right there the authors opinions are not opinions i encourage anyone to have ugg there horrible at one point the book tells you that you must be born a witch that normal everyday people cant be witches what a load of crap!! There is no serious theory in this book only one authors convoluted opinions.. save yourself the time and aggravation and put your money into something more useful.. Everyone's money is hard earned and id hate to see anyone waste there money on this kind of horrible prose .. patrica telesco or silverraven wolf scott cunningham those are much better authors to spend your money on for a book if your looking for a more advanced text to make you think try Aj Drew
2,A rehash of something old with some bad attitude thrown in..,"This book, on its most basic level, has nothing new printed in it. All this book is, is simply a rehash of what other authors have printed in their books. This in itself would normally not bother me, as most books these days have nothing new in them, but overall it was her attitude that ruined this book for me. Throughout the whole book she kept harping on about how her way was THE way and that if you did something differently, that wasn't pre-approved by her, then you weren't a real witch. I gave this book two stars because there is some very basic info in this book; you just have to pick through all of her ego-trip material. I also gave it an extra star because all of that said, boy can this lady write. Her use of words astounded me and it moved me to the point where I thought that she deserved another star. I think that if she were to attempt to write something fictional, it would be hailed with great success"
1,And here we go again,"Essentially this book contains the same material we've seen again, and again, and again. Primarily this book is simply a re-write of common and widely available material that has been around in print for many years. Mixed with this are the uninspired musings of the author, and nothing really unique there either.My advice is to save your money and go back and read the beginner's books you already. You won't miss anything by passing on this book."
2,ok book,"Its not a bad book, but like people said theres nothing new in this book. One thing I didnt like about it is she kinda made wicca seem more mechanical. It dosnt have that earth nature feel that cuningham keeps in all of his books. If youre looking for a book on sorcery and begining magick this is a good book but an even better one would be Mastering Witchcraft by Paul Huson."
3,Llewellyn got it right this time...,"I've never been a fan of Llwellyn's on witchcraft, but I have to give kudos for this one. The first few sections show you what it takes mentally and physically to be a witch. You need to be level headed and in control of your life and she WILL tell you that if you can't handle your own feelings, then you best get out of Witchcraft. Great exercises in balancing the mind and its possibilities. I only give it three stars because I don't think you should include such powerful spellwork (as contained in the book) until you have a year or more experience. De Angeles has content that some teachers wouldn't want their students practicing until MUCH later. If you are an advanced witch, however, I think you'll get something out of it."
2,Hypnosis DVD,This is definately NOT worth the price. Bought expecting high quality filming. Not even close. It looks like the guy filmed it using a home camera . He even lists things written on poster paper. Also is voice I found annoying and could not relax. Would not recommend.
2,Errrrr.....,"Not pleased. Having listened to this after Beyond Twilight's BRILLIANT release ""Section X"", this is just a very weak effort. I liked Jorn Lande in Masterplan, especially the Aeronautics album, but the lyrics here (not sure if he wrote them) are just laughable.""I will break out from this madnessThere is nothing here but sadness""....Come on. Rhyming for the sake of rhyming..? Any song on Section X blows this album away. And it doesnt hurt that the singer is one of the best I've ever heard. Good job with the replacement boys. Basically..""hellfire"" starts with a minute of robot speak that gets very annoying (Ayreon like), and godless and wicked has lyrics like ""Godless and wicked, creepy and cold"", I barely got through this album. I'll give it two stars because musically its got some good parts, but the lyrics and arrangement , especially in the case of hellfire, killed it for me. Pick up Section X instead, its one of the best albums I've ever heard."
5,Fantasy Epic,"The Crystal Shard is a fantastic book, especially for those new to the fantasy genre. R.A. Salvatore is at his finest when introduces the world to not only Drizzt but Wulfgar, Bruenor, Cattie-Brie and others. Even though this is not the first book chronlogically in the Drizzt series this is probably the first one you should read. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
3,The series Chronologically Before this was Much Better,The Crystal Shard was a lot more childish than i expected after reading the Underdark Trilogy. Akar Kessel the main antagonist was a sad pathetic wizard with the mentality of a three year old who just so happens to come across a gem of ultimate power with a one drawback the gem tries pushing for world domination.All in all I should have stopped reading this series after the Underdark Trilogy.
3,Jagged pages?,This review isn't really about the books or about Salvatore's writing... And really it's more me just plain asking questions about the product rather than a review.I bought the first 7 parts that are available in the new de-luxe hardcover version of `The Legend of Drizzt'. And all of the books had jagged pages. I don't really know what to say... ARE they supposed to look that way or what? Did anyone else get books that look that way?Because this isn't my vision of a hardcover de-luxe edition. I just want answers because I've never seen anything like it before.
1,yuck,"R.A. Salvatore is a poor writer, whose work is extremely derivative, to the point of stealing names from other authors. This book was full of boring action and perfunctory character development. It depressed me by its badness. If you've already read and enjoyed books by this author, go for it. If you are new to fantasy literature read Tolkien or LeGuin."
2,Over rated,"In my opinion a good aurthor works in two ways: what he writes, and how he writes it. Salvatore has good ideas but his style of writting is simply too childish. His characters are realistic until they get into battle, where they are able to kill twenty enemies a piece!! (completely over the top, even for fantasy.)"
1,"I tried, I really did","Many of my friends have read this series and said it's unbelievable. I started it, I think it's utter drivel. I don't oft put books down. This is one. In fact, I threw it away so it's horribleness wouldn't contaminate the rest of my collection."
5,AMAZING!!!,"Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Icewind Dale Trilogy- The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, and The Halfling's Gem, brings to life the story of a good hearted dark elf ranger named Drizzt Do'Urden and his adventures in the northwestern reaches of the World of Faerun. The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense. RA Salvatore has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies. Duty, honor, bravery, magic, dragons and heroes are all about. A great trilogy indeed and a ""must read"" along with RA Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy!"
5,Salvatore shows his best stuff!,"How can those guys just say that this book sucks?? It is one of the best fantasy books ever written. In my mind, it is only topped by the likes of Weiss's Dragonlance, and the J.R.R. Tolkien: Fellowship of the ring series. If you liked those books, you have just go to tread this one."
5,Probably THE best book to hook people onto fantasy reading,"This is where it all started for RA Salvatore and his awsome characters of Drizzt, Bruennor, and Wulfgar. This book and its characters draws you in like no other and you just can not put it down. The entire trilogy is right up there with the classic Lord of the Rings-only this is easier to read and even more vivid."
4,Good start to the trilogy,"I'm writing this after having finished the whole trilogy. All 3 books of ""Icewind Dale"" are fun and a quick read and are filled with action and adventure. An interesting foe in the evil mage Kessel and the rest of his allies - the demon Errtu, the goblins, orcs and giants."
3,not that interesting,"I dont know about this book much,I havent read in to much about it but judging from there I feel that its sorted disconnected from the previous dark elf trilogy, it doesnt mention all those memorable characters, Zaknafein, clacker, belwar, mooshie, so I was quite dissapointed there, or his solitude struggles in the vile underdark, and his painful memories and wrongful ways he learned of his kin. He only tells a very brief side of his pass that he was a dark elf and his people did not prefer the stars and sunlight, it was so vague it really made me doubt of his wring skills at that time. I found out why later he wrote the icewinddale trilogy before the dark elf trilogy and this was were his very first books he wrote, his imagination and his level of writing here is nowhere close to when he later wrote the dark elf trilogy, I only recommend this book as a followup so you understand how he first met up with his companions bruenor, wulfgar, cattiebrie, and regis."
4,Salvatore's original foray into The Forgotten Realms,"Series review: The Icewind Dale TrilogyYet another excellent series by R. A. Salvatore, set in the Forgotten Realms genre. Some have criticized it for being rather derivative (i.e., Wulfgar the Barbarian = Fritz Leiber's Fafhred, Bruenor the Dwarf = JRRT's Gimli, Regis the Halfling = JRRT's Merry Brandybuck, etc.), but I was able to enjoy the series despite those parallels.It's not Lord of the Rings, but it's still enjoyable none the less ... and it ranks high among the growing plethora of novels set in the Forgotten Realms sub-genre. Fans of the D20/AD&D; (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons) gaming system (by Wizards of the Coast) who like simple, straight-forward fantasy action, with plenty of familiar spells, familiar monsters, and familiar magic items, will enjoy this series.Salvatore's popular character, Drizzt, makes his first appearance in this series."
5,Drizzt is fantasy 101!!!,"R.A Salvatore is my favorite author and he really makes his fantasy your life! This is yet again another great tale of drizzt and his few but loyal freinds. This is also one of R.A's first books and really vividly gives you great character background. You can just invishion yourself ingulfed within the spine of the world right from page 1!!I would definitly and already have always recamind any drizzt book to anyone interested in REALLY GOOD, REAL fantasy!!It's definitly even better if you read them in order :)"
5,WONDERFUL!!!!,"My dad gave me a lot of old books at one point. This was one of them. I didn't want to read it until my sister told me to. I loved it so much I read it in one sitting. A few days later I bought another book in the series. I urge anyone even remotely interested in fantasy to read everything Salvatore has written. Don't stop typing, Bob!"
2,"A bit overrated, I think...","I hate to say this, but R.A. Salvatore is really not a very good writer. When I was, oh, ten or twelve, I absolutely adored this stuff. Then I got older, and I found that that had changed quite a bit. Salvatore's characters are very flat and bland, even when they're not obvious Tolkien rip-offs. Having a drow as a central character is novel, but that's about all it is. I think it strikes a chord because everybody feels persecuted sometimes and wishes that they were strong enough to DO something about it. Drizzt is a guy who really IS and CAN. Really, though, the dialogue is trite, the battle scenes are unspeakably tedious, and, though I can't outright condemn it (I sure as hell enjoyed it at one time), I can't recommend it to anyone either."
1,adults need not reply,"hi, i am a rad illiterate 8th grader, and i think that these books ROCK THE HOUSE!! man, this is the BEST WRITING EVER IN THE WORLD< AND IF YOU DONT THINK SO YOUR MOMMA IS A DOPE!! yeah, these ooks are the best ones ever written, and they are so ground braking i cannt believe it! all i gottas say is, WOW!!The preceding text has been brought to you by a typical drooling, zit covered RA Salvatore fan fresh out of the 8th grade."
3,"The plot is very obvious, but the book is fun none the less.","After reading the Crystal Shard I found that I wanted to read the rest of the books in Salvatore's series with the main character Drizzt Do'Urden. The crystal shard is to books what action films are to movies. If you want a fun book with lots of action and not a very complex plot then this is the book for you. If you are looking for a book that is Science Fiction but has a deep plot while still keeping the reader entertained, then try some other author because in none of the works following this book does a deep plot ever appear. Though I enjoyed the book I must confess it is one of my dirty little pleasures in life to read these 'action"" books. In any case the book is worth reading because as the saying goes: ""To each his own"""
3,I liked it but it's not AWESOME,"I liked this trilogy very much, but it's not in my all time favs. I think it can be a little boring and a little slow. I did love the concept and theme. The characters are interesting and who doesn't love Drizzit? Worth the read but you will be able to put it down."
3,An entertaining read,"I have to say that having read the War of the Spider Queen series of books prior to reading The Crystal Shard lead me to be only slightly disappointed in this book. I expected more in it. However, I did find myself utilizing the concept of Ten Towns and their confrontation with orc/orge/giant hordes in a D&D campaign I am running. I guess I wanted more and felt so much more could have been done with the main villian Kessel than was accomplished in this book. Overall, if you are going to read this book for pure entertainment value and not be critically reading it, you will enjoy it. If you require a challenge or a great deal of thinking in your book reading, find another book to read."
3,it didnt make my eyes bleed.,"This an acceptable entry level book to fantasy, it doesn't have any real depth or much in the way of originality. If your looking for a moderately enjoyable book that you can blow through in an evening then its right up your alley.Salvatore writes allot of books, sadly this doesn't mean they are really very good! If he would take his time I suspect he could put out some top of the line novels, but this book (and series) is just another blast of speed writing that leaves much to be desired."
1,beck amley air filter,This Product was the wrong size. Also the filter was very flimsy and cheap. Would not recommend this product to anyone..
5,"LEGENDARY BOOTLEG SHOW NOW ""OFFICIAL""","This show has been released in one bootleg form or another under at least 10 different titles. This, however, is its first ""official"" release. Finally!This was broadcast on FM radio out of Hempstead, NY in December 1972, and sounds FANTASTIC. This is the entire show, uncut and in order, complete with mid-show interview. Lou's backing band, The Tots, put on an incredible show. Sometimes prone to unfocused and less-than-energetic performances, The Tots put on the show of their lives here. This is Lou Reed without props, without camp, and just in your face Rock 'N' Roll.My only complaint stems from the packaging. Yes, you get great photos by Icon-maker Mick Rock, but the review/writing in the booklet appears to have been authored by a 3rd grader! Spelling mistakes, poor grammar, run-on sentences...you get the picture. However, you ARE spending money for the music, right?"
4,The missing link,"This CD is the missing link between the sometimes rambling live sound of the velvet underground and the glamrock-like live cd's ""R&R animal"" and ""live"".Biggest surprises for me were the arrangements for waiting for my man and berlin: they remind very much of the versions on ""take no prisoners"" except that these aren't over the top...How relaxed the recording is, proves Mr Reed himself while playing ""Rock and Roll"" - and this is a quote - "" you can clap"" and his cheery ""lalala"" in a very friendly version of Sweet Jane.And this brings me to the only minus of the CD: most of the songs are available in more than one differnet live-version. So how surprising these versions might be - sometimes you'd wish he'd played/the editor selected some different songs. But for the true fan a must!"
3,GREAT BIT OF ROCK HISTORY,"THERE ARE SEVERAL VERSIONS OF THIS BROADCAST AVAILABLE ON CD.I THOUGHT THE PITCH ON THIS VERSION WAS A BIT FAST & THE NOISE REDUCTION WAS A BIT AGGRESSIVE.I ACTUALLY PREFERRED A REEL TO REEL COPY I HAVE OF THE SHOW I RECORDED BACK IN THE 1970'S.I TRANSFERRED MY COPY TO DAT & USED BITS OF THIS CD TO FILL IN FOR SOME BAD EDITING,ie 'THE INTERVIEW & SOME OTHER BITS' THAT WERE CHOPPED IN THE RE-BROADCAST I HAD RECORDED.ALSO THE DISC HAD A BIT OF ECHO THAT A LOT OF REMASTERED CD'S SEEM TO ACQUIRE,WHEREAS MY COPY HAD A 'DRYER' SOUND.ANYWAY THIS IS A GREAT SHOW,IF YOU'VE NEVER HEARD IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.THE 'TOTS' ROCK WAY BETTER THAN REED'S SLICK STUDIO BAND."
1,It's not a pad. It's just a cover.,"Product Description says: 1.5"" x 20"" x 72"" - Weight: 2lbs. I wonder why I got the pad cover only."
5,Woohoo,"If you look at my cd collection, you will find a spectrum of assortments, ranging from Amorphous Androgynous to Paganini. I like special talents and Dara is a special talent. This CD is probably his best besides Renegade Continuum II. Unfortunately the last one I heard of his was Further (which was also very good), so I am not up to date with what he's doing now. Hope he's still as good."
2,The only Kristen's workout I woudln't buy,"When I read in the description: ""two (15 minute) circuits..."" I thought the DVD actually came with two different circuits that I could combine... For my disappointment, I found my self buying the most expensive Kristen workout to only find that it last 15 minutes in total! And then She repeats the same circuit one more time, as if you couldn't replay it. I have bought all Kristen DVDs, including her MTV collection and the Bethenny one... They are all amazing. But Yoga Tone in particular is the only Kristen DVD I wouldn't buy again."
5,If you want a workout then this is the one you want,"Yoga Tone, did not disappoint me in anyway. I have always been a fan of yoga but this is not like normal yoga. You have the opportunity to tone your body while you are doing yoga. This DVD offers such great strength toning routines. Which for men that aren't really into yoga, this would be great for them. Since, this allows you to work with weights to tone during your routine.I am not really needing to lose any weight but I do need to get some tone to my body. After having two little ones and running after them at all times. My body is lacking in the tone area. One thing that I have to mention that I love, is the fact that it offers two 15 minute circuits. If I have the chance I get to do two of them, if not at least I can get my one 15 minute circuit completed. If you can't start out like a pro at first you can work yourself up.If you are looking for a way to tone your body but still do your yoga you love, this offers that and more."
5,I would give it 6 stars if I could...,"Amr Diab is to Arabic music what Michael Jackson is to pop. He is an icon, a game-changer. His music, voice, style, melodies have inspired much of the arabic music you hear today. This CD is amazing! I love it. I am saying this as a Lebanese person, Egpyt should be proud of this man and his legacy."
5,The best disc I've purchased this year!,"Having been in the audio business for over twenty years, I have amassed a very, very large music collection. But seldom does a disc of this merit appear. Every person who has heard it, wants it. The last recording to recieve this acceptence was Dr. John's In A Sentimental Mood, and that was over seven years ago."
5,Johnny Adams and Aaron Neville,"What more could you want . . . so fine, really fine . . . don't let this soulful music die . . . give it your support."
3,"Only for Serious Sir Walter Scott, Washington Irving, and/or Lord Byron Fans...","As part of the great American authors interview great European authors series...But seriously.You may not realize that Washington Irving once visited Sir Walter Scott. If you didn't, then this book contains the recanting of that tale, as well as a visit to Newstead Abbey, the home of the late Lord Byron (late even in Irving's day). It is somewhat interesting from a historical standpoint, but there is nothing in this book that is of great interest unless you are a fan of either Sir Walter Scott, Washington Irving, Lord Byron, or some combination of these...Yet, I am selling short those folks who enjoy reading historical Scottish travelogues. Oh, for shame.Still, a very unique piece of literature which is short enough, and written well enough that it might be worthy of your time, proving you are an avid reader."
5,If I could I would have given it 10+stars!!,Ruth Langan never fails to bring her readers to a magical time in history! This book is an absolute must for everyone! It keeps your eyes glued to the pages until its done but the characters never leave your heart!
1,Shame!!!,"Be warned! Whatever you think about Nazareth, this is a lousy DVD. It is not as described. It does not recount their history. There are no interviews, no detailed portrait. It does not look at their legacy. There are no unreleased tracks from Expect No Mercy. The 'memorabilia' section amounts to a bunch of crappy photos. Truth be told, this is just a low quality recording of an incomplete BBC 'Sight & Sound' concert broadcast from 1977. The extras merely comprise the aforementioned photos, plus a few (embarrassingly bad) videos tacked on. One thing the DVD does reveal is that Manny Charlton really wasn't a very good guitarist. At their best Nazareth were a great band, but this is not Nazareth at their best. It does them no justice. Avoid!"
2,What tape did they use to source this DVD??,"Without a doubt, this is the poorest quality officially released DVD I've ever seen. At first I thought there was a problem with my television set. I was seeing lots of fuzz around the edges of the performers - ghost (double) images, video noise in what should have been a perfectly black background...I switched to an S Video cable and it made no difference. And then I saw the glitch that really took the cake - a nice fat tape role and the picture momentarily went to black and white.Quite obviously - ZERO production went into this. They simply played an old tape copy of the show, captured it to a harddrive, encoded a low quality mpeg, and authored a DVD. I've done much better productions myself on my home computer.All quality issues aside - it's vintage Nazareth and I really enjoyed watching it - thus a two star rating."
3,"5-star Soulful Voice, 1-star sterile 'band'.","I really like the voice of Kelly on this album, and although the producers and/or musicians and/or recordingengineers did a nice job: It is a thousand pities, that japanese band-in-a-box sound. This horrible sterile guitar and oboe. I want REAL HORNS! A REAL BAND! REAL R&BSOUL! And it can be done without xeroxing. Kelly deserves it. Kelly can handle a big sound with a nice arrangement. Please record 'As we lay' again!(And please leave out the 'mirror mirror'-radioplay stuff. You don't need that Kelly!)"
4,KELLY PLEASE BELT OUT THE SONGS,"EVERY ONES KNOW THAT SOUL OF A WOMAN WAS THE ALBUM KELLY WAS SINGING HER BUT OFF. THIS ALBUM THE LATEST MIRROR, MIRROR IS A NICE ALBUM BUT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR KELLY TO REALLY BELT OUT NOTES DONT HOLD YOUR BREATH. SHE GROWS AS A ARTIST BUT SHE LEAVES OUT 1 KEY ELEMENT. KELLY NEVER REALLY GIVES U THE VOCALS THAT SHE HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR THIS WAS THE TIME FOR U TO SHINE KELLY.... THE BACKGROUND VOCALS CARRY MOST OF THE SONGS WITH KELLY GIVING A LEAD THAT IS JUST OK, BUT SHE IS NOT DOING TRICKS WITH THE VOICE LIKE THE FIRST ALBUM. BUT I MUST GIVE THE GIRL THE PROPS SHE WROTE 99% OF THE ALBUM WHICH IS SMART ( MORE MONEY GIRL ) BUT THE ALBUM IS A ALBUM THAT U CAN PLAY FROM START TO FINISH. NOW LETS JUST SIT BACK AND SEE HOW DEF JAM PROMOTES THE ALBUM. THIS ALBUM WILL GO PLATINUM WITH THE RIGHT PROMOTION. IF U FEEL WHAT I AM SAYING EMAIL ME AT HE2SEXY@AOL.COM"
2,Good Vocalist Lame Typical Current R-N-B,"WHere are The True R-N-B Writters&Producers? Kelly Price has a Good Voice.but this Lame run of the mill Music does here no Justice.As We Lay is Pretty Good.but Who ever said that Shirley Murdock's day was Done? she is still a Better Vocalist than Kelly.Shirley had The Genius of ROger Troutman to Work With Kelly Price has nobody on that Level.I Wish She had have put as Much Energy into The Production,Writting&Musicianship of the Album as She did into Her Latest Appearence.She Looks Great&has a Good Voice but the Music&Production could be anybody."
3,She ain't that hot!,"As vocalist Kelly's is great. She has an enoromous range. But her music/writing is pretty boring. She continiously runs over the same topic of her man cheating on her. Tracks like ""She Wants You"", ""Mirror, Mirror"", and the song with Gerald Levert and K-Ci are all about cheating, trying to get with someone when you have someone and stuff along those lines. Kelly blew up on the strength of ""Friend of Mine"", (which was about a friend taking her man) that song was remarkable, but enough is enough! All the guest appearances do not mesh well with Kelly. K-Ci and Gerald Levert got raw soulful voice. They would sound better with a Mary J., not Kelly. Method Man? Hardcore rapper Method Man? With Kelly? Puh-lease. She tried to pull off the R&B/Hip Hop thing with some of the songs, but she not one of the artist who could do both, hence Mary J. and Faith Evans. All in all, Kelly is capable of being one of the best, but she's in desperate need of some good material."
4,Kelly's Here To Stay,"Kelly Price has truly outdone herself on this album. From her upbeat, lively songs such as ""Love Will Set You Free"" to her slow emotional songs like ""As We Lay."" Kelly Price is back with a new voice, a new style, and a new look and is here to stay."
4,Simply the Best,"I will begin with the remake of "" As we lay"". I never thought that it could or would be made over because it is just one of those songs that you don't touch, you just leave it as it is. Well Kelly Price did just that. She just added vocal styling and not alot of production hoop-la. Kelly's voice dominates on this CD. She again captures her audience/listeners with soulful breath taking tunes. Although I was expecting ""The National Athem"" to be the traditional song, just with her style added on to it. As a vocalist I like to study her alot. I tend to listen her vocal stlye, slides, phrasing and her pitch. I like the fact that she is classy and that's what her CD says. kelly you are ""Simply the Best"""
4,Kelly Price is Back!,"Kelly Price is back with Mirror, Mirror. And I hope that the world take notice to reconize that great vocal powerhouse that she is. She has Method Man, R. Kelly, Gerald Levert, K-Ci, and her children Jeff Jr., and Jonia. This young lady had been through lawsuits with her former record label T neck. And is shinning bright with Def Soul Records. I think highlights on this album are the bluesy ""I can't run away"", the very seductive ""She wants you"", ""Married Man"", Nathem Anthem (feat.R. Kelly). I am disappointed in the remake Of ""As We Lay"" I think Kelly held back on this song because I've heard that song sung better by another R&B Siren and Kelly could've done better. Overall this is a must have for all TRUE R&B FANS!"
5,THIS GIRL CAN SING! WHAT A VOICE!,"FIVE STARS IS NOT ENOUGH, THIS CD IS THE BEST I'VE HEARD THIS YEAR.IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT...GO AND GET IT NOW.THE NATIONAL ANTHEM INTERLUDE IS THE BOMB! KELLY, YOU GO GIRL!"
4,a great cd!,"this lady can just flat out Sing! also she able to go toe-to toe with the song ""AllI Want Is You"" with Gerald Levert & K-CI Hailey,"
4,"Kelly, Kelly","I really enjoyed Kelly Price's first album and anxiously awaited her follow up. I am so glad that I was not disappointed. Not only did Kelly come back with a new album, but with a new look. She looks great and the album sounds great."
3,Real R&B,"When Kelly first came out back in 1998, it was already evident that she was not one of these new Mariah Carey kinda singers. She was a true R&B Aretha like singer. Fueled mainly by the fact that I liked 1st single AS WE LAY and there werem't 2 many other good CDs out at the time, I bought this CD. Well, in order to fully enjoy it one must be an R&B lover b/c the songs are pretty soulful. Some of the best songs are the midtempos such as LOVE CAN SET YOU FREE, 3 STRIKES, YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME, and ALL IS WANT IS YOU. Kelly has a nice voice but as said you have to like the R&B to really enjoy the CD."
5,Songbird of Soul,Kelly Price is an beautiful artist inside and out. I happen to like Soul of A Woman a tad bit better but her sophmore effort Mirror Mirror is excellent. This album is mostly upbeat with some awakening lyrics. She has a few slow cuts on this cd. It's worth listening to. One Love.
5,Big Kellyb Price Fan !,"the CD it really shows what kelly price is about is diffently one of the new diva's on the music seen today. you can put her music in a catagory with Mrs. franklin and Mrs. Knight. and that is tha truth it is hard these days to find a arist that can really sing like kelly price. this is the cd to get she have more fast songs then your last CD had. This CD is for a mature ear. Because of the things that she talks about . I hope that the other viewers injoy the Cd as much as I did .and I also injoyed kelly's last CD A SOUL OF A WOMAN. I also recommend JOE, CARL THOMAS, TONI BRAXTON!"
3,Kelly Price is Wonderful,"I love Kelly Price to death and I know her music is great she is good at what she do and the songs she singa are true because someone out there in the world is living that life,I know I'm one of those people living the life of ""As We Lay"" and ""You Should Have Told Me"" I also love Kelly Price for her looks she has come over a great deal of weght loss something I admire her for because that gives me courage and strenght to do it.Well I'll end this review by saying Kelly you go girl and keep being great and what you're doing and keep making those truthful songs for me and all the other ladies out here having that trouble."
5,Reminds Me of a Young ARETHA,"Honestly speaking, I was unfamiliar with Price until she supported Whitney Houston on ""Heartbreak Hotel."" I purchased ""Mirror, Mirror"" solely on the strength of the cover of Murdock's ""As We Lay.""Stunning is the best word to describe the recording. Besides ""Lay,"" other listening pleasures are the title cut (with a great band outro, reminiscent of the strings of Nelson Riddle), ""She Wants You,"" ""All I Want is You,"" and ""I know Who Holds Tomorrow."""
4,Kelly can SING!,"That is all I have to say about that...This CD has some really great songs...and other so/so ones, but her voice makes up for it."
5,I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF KELLY PRICE!!!!!!!,"I've been blowin' this CD ever since it dropped. I even went and bought her first CD, ""Heart of a Women"", I just needed more Kelly! Her singing evokes so much emotion and soul,it touches my soul. She's reminicent of an early Aretha Franklin - but make no mistake, Kelly has her own unique flava. I'm already looking forward to her next CD!"
5,A gotta see it for all film snobs,"Lets just say that I've done my home work before I purchase anything, even with amazons liberal return policies...so all my reviews will be just like this"
3,battery,"The batteries were not really strong. They read about 85 to 90 percent charge. By the time I get to use all of them, they may be discharged to the point where they will not be useful."
2,"Great price, HORRIBLE performance",Wish I'd read all those reviews saying how bad these perform. These were a total waste of money. The battery life is terrible and I have even put brand new batteries in that were completely dead. Do not buy these if you can help it.
2,NEVER WROTE A PRODUCT REVIEW BEFORE SO YOU GUYS BETTER LISTEN,THESE batteries are not worth it.way too short.LESS than half of the life of the name brands available on amazon.
3,Universal Batteries Heavy-Duty,"These Batteries seem to have a short term charge, I was very unhappy with them. I use them in a portable tape player,and in a portable Disc player, you get into the story and have to change batteries right in the middle."
3,Gets The Job Done!,"May not last as long as the major batteries brand, but it gets the job done over in Afghanistan! Your batteries saved the day and we were well pleased. Arrived less than a week..in Afghanistan!That's awesome!"
2,Not Recommended!,"The price was great, but batteries are not. Very short life. Batteries last about half as long as a good name brand. So there is no real savings. I cannot recommend this product."
2,Do not last,They last a very short time and they will leak. They look like they might of been good batterys until you start using them and have to keep changing them often i mean often like every two to three days.
1,Like Candy,"I use batteries for my overhead projector pen. Compared to any other battery, these have by far the shortest life. This is the worst value in batteries ever! I don't even like to put them in my pen because I know they will last 1/8th of the time any of the others will last. Just say no to these batteries!"
3,"Looks cool, not very sturdy","Looks really cool and fun to show team allegiance, but fabric is not extremely durable. Also, there's not much friction on the fabric so I am resizing it to fit my dog once a day. Recommended for an inside dog."
4,Good low budget Captain America,"For what it's worth these two tv movies aren't that bad. I think that have a charm that goes along with low budget fare. Seeing that these were produced in 1979, you can't blame the producers from shying away from super villians. This was a set of pilots set to introduce Captain America into a TV series. While it's no Incredible Hulk or Spider-Man, it's a good show. If you consider all the bad movies and TV shows out there, it's ok for an afternoon. I only wish it were written better and the lead actor, Reb Brown, had an acting coach on the set."
4,Great TV movie,"After watching this movie for myself , I like it and highly suggest to anyone wanting to fill their captain america movie collection"
4,Stopped too soon,"another series that could have been, if they'd picked this up as a weekly series I'd have watched. This was another set of movies that could have become a great series. A lot of the story line from the comics wasn't adhered to but this was a new generation Captain America for a new day and a new time all in all both movie's were well done."
5,I LOVE A HERO.,"I DONT MIND HOW OLD THIS THIS SHOW IS. I JUST LOVE IT. CAPTAIN AMERICA IN THIS SHOW IS AWESOMES, WHAT A GOOD GUY. THE GUY WHO PLAYS HIM IS VERY KIND AND JUST. NOT LIKE TODAY WHEN EVERY THING HAS TO BE LOUD AND MONSTEROUS TO GET THE MESSAGE THROUGH. THANKS CAPTAIN AMERICA."
4,Travers Corners,"I found this a wonderful book that relates well to so many things in life, both past and present. You can identify with the characters as to the times you may have done similiar things yourself. Very entertaining, one minute you may be laughing yourself silly and then two pages later crying tears of sadness."
4,"Relaxing, warm hearted reading","This book seems to be written for the fishermen but it will appeal at a much broader level, though there is much to catch the interest and heart of those dedicated to the art of fly fishing. Each chapter is a seperate special little nugget involving those that enter the lives of the characters that frame and fill out all of the stories. You may laugh outloud at some parts and shed a tear at others but it is a story that will appeal to both men and women."
4,Talk about deer in the headlights!,"Our back yard was a freeway for deer. Our neighbor has a garden center which has been destroyed by deer. Now, we all know deer do not have a ""headlights look"" because most are too dumb to even know that a car is in the area. But wolf urine WILL get their attention! We and our neighbors both tried this stuff and it works great! I only hope that it does not attract wolves."
1,get coyote urine instead!,"i bought a couple jugs of this juice because i thought it would be at least as tasty as coyote urine flavor, but it isn't. although wolves are my favorite animals, and coyotes are too stupid and wile e. coyote ruined their image, this is one battle they cannot win. coyotes apparently are more flavorful than the wolves. my friend also agrees, though he isn't a HUGE fan of either, he does prefer the coyote one."
3,Great results,"I've had great results with the wolf urine for repelling deer, coons, squirrel, skunk, platypus and chupacabra from my garden. My greatest problem was it always seemed to lure the wolves to my garden. Imagine my dismay when I realized all the pests were no longer eating out of my garden, but large families of wolves would sit in my garden at night and howl at the moon.What this company now needs to bottle is Chuck Norris urine to repel the wolves. I would pay a large bounty for gallon jugs of Chuck Norris urine just so I don't have to listen to the wolves howling in my garden every night.The product works as a great repellent for other animals, but the downfall is that it seems to attract every wolf within a 1,200 mile radius to my garden."
4,I don't know what all the fuss is about...,"I purchased the Wolf Urine Lure - 32oz not knowing what to expect but what a pleasant surprise it has been!I found it to be a bit dry, along the lines of Plymouth Gin or Beefeater but with much more aroma and a fuller, deeper flavor. This isn't Wolf Urine Lure for the faint of heart. Mixed into a Gimlet or a Martini, this can be an experience that only a hardened drinker will really enjoy. For the novice, you'd best be served by mixing this with a good, high end tonic water (never diet tonic water! Yuck! It taste terrible!) or perhaps a fortified wine along the lines of Dubonet to create a flavorful and enchanting cocktail.So, on a warm summer evening, enjoy a Wolf Urine Lure and OJ or perhaps Grapefruit Juice, a truly refresing experience!"
5,At Last!,"Finally! At last, a Wolf Urine that's easy to use! My laundry has never been so fresh and clean! It removes those hard to remove wolf-crap stains on our Three Wolf Moon shirts. And those difficult glowing uranium stains can be simply whisked away! Why scour when Wolf Urine does the work? Get two jugs and share with a friend!"
2,"Solves one problem, starts another","Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic product for keeping deer away from my garden of aconitum plants. One major problem, however, is that is seems to have the opposite effect for werewolves and wolf-man hybrids, which are now a constant plague every month for the neighborhood. I suggest buying some squeaky toys to distract them until morning. Please note this trick will NOT work during mating season, so it's not a great to use product in late winter."
1,Disappointing.,"This stuff tastes awful. For the price it's being sold for I would expect a slightly more salty kick, but it's rather bland despite being so pungent. The fellows down at my dad's lodge barely finished half a jug and complained they made terrible Jaegerbombs. (Can't serve them Red Bull because they all have heart conditions.) Will stick with coyote urine from now on."
3,Tell those wolves to piss off!!!,"Don't kill the messenger here, but Wolf Urine will not solve all of your problems. We've all seen it locked behind glass at Walgreens, the evidence room of your local police precinct, or under your parents' bed. The fact is there's better products out there that are not only better for you, but better for the environment. I'm talking about Jack Nicholson's urine.I know what your thinking, because Jack Nicholson's urine has given me clairvoyant powers and this allows me to fantasize about Clair Danes for days without fatigue. You owe it to yourself and your case worker to spend that windfall from your pull-tabs marathon on Genuine Jack-Whizz(tm). Or, if the caste system of your local village prohibits it, you might procure yourself some John Cougar Urine. The only celebrity urine that is guaranteed to give you rickets.God Bless"
3,Good and bad...,"This product gets three stars and here's why:Good: This is soooooooo much easier than trying to get the Wolf Urine directly from a Wolf. Wolves are, from my experience, VERY possessive of their urine. Until the advent of theThe Mountain Men's Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee(which acts to calm the wolves) let's just say vicious bites and deep lacerations were the norm when trying to ""milk"" the wolves of their urine (how else can you get it?). Even with theThe Mountain Men's Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Teeit was never easy. This product had changed all of that!Bad: As a lure this thing sucks. I can't even get a hook into it. It's liquid! HELLOOOOOO??? Who makes a lure out of liquid??? Shiny plastic, rubber, or metal, sure, but liquid? No, this is a serious design flaw."
1,Important detail missing...,"What they don't tell you is whether the urine was culled from submissive wolves reacting badly to being scolded, or whether it is from manly alpha males, virilely marking their territory. Until this information is supplied, I cannot recommend this product as an appropriate Valentine's Day gift."
1,Bitterly Disappointed,"My supply of wolf urine was running low and, tired of paying retail prices, I decided to give Deerbusters Wolf Urine Lure a whirl. Disappointed doesn't begin to describe my emotions.Simply put, the product does not work, as it attracted no wolf urine whatsoever.So I guess it's back to the Walmart for me. Don't waste your money on this scam."
3,Mixed Blessing,"I bought this product to get rid of the squirrels in my yard because I figured predation would be the ""greenest"" form of pest control. The squirrels are gone now, sort of. I was thrilled at first, but now these wolves are crapping all over my lawn and I am at my wits end. To further complicate matters, this company doesn't seem to carry Bear [...]. How else am I supposed to get rid of the wolves?"
3,DO NOT MIX this product with the uranium ore also available on amazon!,"See, there was this full moon, and the uranium ore just kind of fell into the bucket of wolf urine. Some splashed on me, and, well, now I like my meat very rare and I'm getting more and more tempted to chase cars. Hang on. Here comes the mailman. I have to go scare him a bit..."
3,a curse or blessing?,"Several months ago i was planning a trip to Montana, i heard the ladies up there are into some wild stuff so i decided to get some cologne to give that musk i hear they're into. Little did i know that the only ladies that find this scent attractive have more facial hair than i do and are named Russell. Also wherever i went there were dogs who seemed terrified of me, no clue why. At one point i took notice that wherever i went there was a breathing sound. Eventually i woke up to find that my face smelled horrible and felt really sticky, had a bit of a rancid after taste too. When i came back home i still had on the cologne my neighbor's rottweilers couldn't decide on eating my face or having sex with various parts of my body....they did both. I am now very displeased with the side effects it seems to attract. I brought all the wrong kind of attention. Although as of late i find myself going to the park late at night drenched in this and i lie in the grass waiting....."
5,Great for a hilarious workplace urine sample!,HIghly recommended! Helped me land a job at the daycare center! But they never give me a shift when there's a full moon.
4,1950s look at sarees,"This book for me had nostalgic value, since I first saw it not long after it was printed, decades ago. Although now there are more detailed books about Indian sarees, with much more colour, I consider this book is still worth having for the connoisseur. The arrangement of types of sarees by region is fairly brief but useful and clear, and the photos are (as well as being attractive in themselves) indicative of sarees as worn in the 1950s, before a mass of synthetics flooded the market, and advertising became carried away on a fairly Westernized tide. If you are serious in a study of sarees (or just fascinated by them), I would recommend adding this book to your collection."
1,BLACK MAN OF THE NILE,this book is a very bad book. its loaded with racism againts the jews/white man. the author is a degenerate wanabe fool!!!!!
1,Poor Effort,I am disappointed with the poor and almost juvenial presentation of the material which almost resembled jumbled research notes. I will stay clear of this author in the future.
1,Afrocentric crackpot,"Dr.Ben is an afrocentric crack pot period and the factual errors and cherry picking of information to suit his propaganda in the book is disturbing ,do not waste your money."

2,Cognitive Therapy,"The content of the book may be good, but the book itself is not worth it's weight in water. It fell apart, only used a few times and now I have to keep it on the desk to use it. It just fell apart."
3,Just okay,"An average ""B"" grade movie. Not great acting and not a great story line. We wanted a ""scary"" movie to watch, but not too scary for my 8 year old, and this one filled the bill. Quite appropriate for younger audiences (no bad language, violence or the like)."
4,Nice & Scarey,This was a good presentation. We watched it before Halloween and it got us in the mood. Appropriately scarey for pre-teen.
5,This a movie eveyone will love,I love the movie.I love RL Stine all of his work I have seen.Me and sister both love it it is something anyone would love!
5,"Good, scary fun!","I used to love the RL Stine books when I was younger, and this movie brought me back to those fun days of loving to get scared as a kid! A ton of fun! I definitely recommend it for the whole family."
2,Haunted by this Mishap,"While the story would be worthwhile if done a bit differently, the acting and script are horrible. The whining kid was overdone and the smart-mouthed teen girl needs obedience training of some sort, but only after her rabies shot. The actors weren't convincing at all but irritating to say the very least. 2 stars is all I can give this movie. I wouldn't allow children to watch this misguided, mind numbing, nerve grating attempt at entertainment."
4,turbo time,the tracks are fantastic especially train of thought this is not only good clubing music but good for the gym just plug in loose yourself in these awesome beats and loose the pounds let it go and roller coaster are the toppers as well.
2,21st Century Biodiesel Business Management for Producers,"I'll have to say that I'm a little disappointed with this book. 1. at least some of the information is from September of 2001 which the description gives no indication the information is that old. 2. The pages are just photocopied and not even double sided. The back side of every page is blank. 3. There are graphs that were obviously colored at some point, but in this photocopied version, they are black and white and I cannot distinguish the differences in the bar charts. All in all I should have bought the CD version of this book and printed it myself on my color printer and it would have looked nicer than this copy."
5,The beautiful Hilary,"This is my favorite music video, played by my favorite violinist, playing my favorite composer. Lets all pray Hilary will make more videos and share them with us."
2,Not for Dummies,"Anybody that claims this is a book for Dummies isn't a real dummy like I am. I was looking for a good book to help explain Einstein's theoretical discoveries but what I got was a book written by a physicist who just could not write a book for people who don't understand physics.Just like the book on string theory, if you have no fundamental understanding of physics and mathematics you will have a hard time getting through this. It's like a computer manual. The folks who write those books already assume you know how to use a computer and, in many cases, they are incorrect in their assumptions and the manuals prove to be useless to that average man on the street.If you're looking for some simple explanation to a complex theory keep looking - this ain't it!!!!"
3,Einstein for dummies,Not the best of books . Needs more math. Not much more useful than many other books.
5,The best science book I have ever read,"I wish all text books were written like this. It has all the needed details for the kind of book it is, yet written with such a straightforward style that makes it a pleasure to read. Writers of text books can learn a lot from this book. This is what learning should be about."
5,A beautiful discussion,It is the best of the many books that I have read that present Einstein's work in a simplified fashion. The personal data about Einstein is interesting also.
5,Covers a broad range of topics in physics,"An excellent book which clearly describes not only Einstein's contributions to physics, but the contributions of many other physicists who went before him like Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, and Lorentz and who were his contemporaries like Planck and Bohr. In highlighting Einstein's contributions, he covers a wide range of topics including dynamics, electromagnetism, atomic physics, and quantum mechanics. For a more detailed description of physical concepts covering a broader range, I highly recommended his book on superstrings, etc."
4,"Gunsmithing done right, the old school way","Great book, fairly easy to read. It is as good or better than some text books on Gunsmithing in some ways. Information on cutting barrel threads and making special tools for the gun smith. Anybody that wants to learn gunsmithing should get their hands on a copy of this book beginner and pro alike.I agree with some of the reviews, in that this book is old, But I think Old School is the best. This book is fine the way it is, if it were updated it would loose all it's charm. Most all the key information is ageless and timeless for learning some of the basic gunsmithing skills.K.D."
1,Outdated,"Not a bad book for collector guns, but it is very outdated and contains nothing on newer weapons and technology."
2,oldie but oldie,"the book is very detailed and complete for a time long gone by. It was excellent for the time it was written in but those times are no more. I would recommend something more up to date that emphacizes modern materials, modern technologies, current trends and needs and uses. It is sad but the era of elegant custom made hunting rifles and shotguns has been pretty much replaced with durable, low maintanence, mass produced military style weapons that this book doesn't say much about."
5,Gunsmithing,"Had lots of info about brazing, soldering and welding limitations and application. Just what I was looking for."
2,Basic information a bit dated,A lot of information on 1917 enfield. This book has been around a while the first printing was in the 60s. There has been some up dating but it needs a major over haul. All of the pictures are from the 50s and 60s of shops that are not there anymore and of people that have long sense died. Of course some of the basics don't change if you are looking for information on semi autos this is not the place.
3,For Gunsmiths Only,"The book is a little outdated for the times and requires an extensive knowledge of the terminology used in the field to understand what the author is talking about. This book is not a good choice for beginner gunsmiths, but holds a lot of value to intermediate gunsmiths who want to broaden their skill set."
4,Lovely music,"I purchased this CD a couple of years ago. I keep on playing it, because I love this type of music. It has a very calming effect."
1,No sight at all,Thriving as a Broker in the 21st Century makes me disappointed!The content is too general without any insight at all!A waste of money for buying!
1,One big promotional gimmick,"It seems the only reason the book was written was to promote the author's technical analysis business. After all, why couldn't one thrive in the business without knowing how to 'point and figure'??"
1,One big advertisement,"If this book is about thriving as a broker in the 21st century, why does the author have to keep giving a plug for his point and figure charting?? It was difficult getting through the book with this blatant promotion for the author's real business."
1,There are better books,"This book may have been published, just to be published, but not to provide any worthwhile information for such an inflated price. There are some great books out there by Nick Murray, Bill Bachrach and Steve Moeller. Save your money - Stay away from this one.."
1,Self-serving and promotional--author should stick to charts,I agree with the rest of the reviews--this was one big brochure. The only thing it's good for is pushing the author's point and figure business.
5,Great book for Professionals and Individuals,Great book with plenty of ideas from a number of professionals. It was interesting as an individual investor to get a peek into the professional world. I got some good investing ideas from the book.
1,...filler for adult contemporary stations,"This is the sort of music you hear in airports and waiting rooms, driving you crazy but nonetheless getting stuck in your head. Like Hootie and Edwin McCain, this is tailored for adult contemporary listeners and leaves one annoyed at unimaginative lyrics, vanilla hooks, and what must be the whiniest-voiced lead singer in years."
5,Sister Hazel - Fortress,"Good old simple rock and roll. Great feel good music. Change your mind being fun and motivational and catchy. Champagne High a great song and a song most can connect to with the loss of love (then imagining being at that love's wedding). Emily (Indigo Girls) Saliers in background vocals. A song you play over and over to catch the story and double meaning phrases. Ken and Andrew compliment each other. This is one of those albums that each time you hear it, it gets better like a fine wine. Surreal has that Beatle influence and feel in some respects especially in the beginning. Lyrics written in almost a beginning form or model of the Indigo Girls instead of most groups with just catchy phrases. You want to pull the words out and follow along and picture the songs as they play thru your mind. Each album Sister Hazel self-titled, Somewhere more familar, and Fortress all have their different qualities. But I think each time the lyrics and music gets better!"
5,"Awesome, catchy CD","it's a great combination of folk and rock. it has great, catchy songs that you will want to listen to when in any mood. it's a great buy!!"
5,Fortress is Amazing,"This album is truely amazing. Sister Hazel really lets their talent shine on this album. You can connect to almost every song on the album and the music calms your soul. If you have never heard Sister Hazel's music, you will be breath taken. I definately suggest that you give it a try."
5,a good one...believe me,"the new on by sister hazel is awesome. after an average first cd, the group puts together a masterpiece. the songs jump out as the music captivates the listener. i was very impressed with the band's ability to combine the mellowness of a pop group with the magnificent sounds of rock. each song leaves the listener humming and singing the words of the very talented band. the cd is packed with 14 not just good but great songs for a real audio treat. this baby is awesome...believe me."
4,Good Album,"This is the first album by Sister Hazel I've ever listened to and it is pretty good. One of the best songs {in my opinion} is ""CHANGE YOUR MIND"". ""BACK PORCH"" is only instrumental, so, well, I don't know. Every song has it's own way of.....um, being itself in it's own special way.......Sometimes I feel the earth move. Anyhoo, there is also a song called ""FORTRESS"" which is also special......and sometimes I like time to myself to listen to this album. The album's cover is hazy looking and inside of the booklet it shows the lyrics............ ........and finally I...like to feel the earth move... ..........and I like to have time to myself to listen to this album."
3,"A great CD, but the first one is a lot better!!","If you don't know Sister Hazel I recommend to buy ""Somewhere more Familiar"", their first CD. On Fortress, Some songs are good, but not much. I'm a little bit disapointed about their second album..."
5,The best band for you money,"This is by far the best band around right now. Their songs take you through every emotion you can think of. There are up beat, fun songs like Beautiful Thing and Elvis, Deep, spirtual songs like Strange Cup of Tea, and heartfelt songs like, Shame on me, Champagne High, and Your Winter. This CD will stay in your collections for a LONG time."
4,"Not quite Stout, but solid","Murder in E Minor is the first of several Nero Wolfe novels (eight at present) by Robert Goldsborough. Nitpickers will doubtless be able to find faults in Goldsborough's style, but his energy, humor and plots are well worth the time. Since all the Wolfe novels are ostensibly witten by Archie, I must say that Goldsborough has captured his voice remarkably well.The death of a controversial music conductor, an old acquaintance of Wolfe's, provides the impetus to send Archie off to discover the cause of death and Wolfe to untangle the murderer. Like I say, Murder in E Minor is well worth the time."
3,like Rex Stout,"I'm 69 and from Carmel, In [20 miles from his home in Noblesville. I start reading his work in the school library .I had doubt about a surogate author but was pleased with the acuracy of the details. and will continue to read Robert Goldsborough"
3,Interesting but patchy in what it covers,"If you just want a general overview of most aspects of car aero then its fine but the subtitle, A Practical Handbook, is misleading. There is a lot of coverage of certain topics but my particular interest, to design a front spoiler with undertray for my sports car, is neglected. Yes there is some info on that topic but nearly all of it relates to simulations while there is virtually nothing on the real world practical application of those simulation results or on the various designs that have been used on real cars. In contrast there is a lot of such information on rear wings. Finally, as someone else mentioned, its written in that British style which tends towards verbosity at the expense of clarity, I prefer the more direct American style of writing for technical subjects. PS I am not American."
5,Job Well Done!,"E. D. Johnson has written an intriguing tale of national conspiracy and fraternal deception. As you meet Marshall, Collette, Ressie and Malik, you are immediately transported inside the scintillating environment of the entertainment industry and the Black paramilitary underground. Glitz and glamour compete with ghosts of the past as secrets are emancipated and salvation is achieved. The Mark Of Cain answers the age old question, ""Am I my brother's keeper?"""
5,A Truly Excellent CD,"This should have been released as a Church CD. It is probably one of the best works recorded by any mutation of the band. The sound and the mix is clearer and not as murky as Hologram of Baal, and the songs adventerous, fun and creative. Features great textures, guitars and singing and Kilbey's trademark obscure lyrics. If you can get this buy it! Well worth the import price."
5,"One of my favorites; gift recipient found it ""odd""","I love this book and find it some of Twain's best social commentary. I gave it to a good friend with a sense of humor who confessed that he found it ""quite odd."" I don't know what he expected, but apparently it requires a certain taste in humor - at least to share my level of love for it.I'd give it again, but probably to someone whose tastes i'm more certain of."
2,Not a very good book by Twain,"The main story line is OK, but Twain spends way too much time on the meanderings of the American claimant character. It seriously detracted from the main story. The ending was kind of left open as well, leaving off on another of the American claimant's unintelligent musings."
5,deeeeeeelicious,"yummy. some of the best tasting protein bars available. great for low-carb dieters or diabetics if you believe in the theory that ""net carbs"" (carbs minus fiber, etc.) should be counted instead of just ""carbs"". no artificial sweeteners like sucralose, etc., which is good if you think those things may cause cancer...the low ""net carbs"" are due to a high amount of ""sugar alcohols"". these bars are best found for less than $1 per bar or $15 per 15 bar case.ABOUT SUGAR ALCOHOLSSugar alcohols are usually incompletely absorbed into the blood stream from the small intestines which generally results in a smaller change in blood glucose than regular sugar (sucrose). This makes them popular sweeteners among diabetics and low-carb dieters. As with many other incompletely digestible substances (dietary fiber), overconsumption can lead to bloating, diarrhea and flatulence because they are not absorbed in the small intestine. Doesn't happen to me... Good luck."
4,gift purchase,I'm giving 4 stars since I have not read the book it is a gift to my husband. The seller was quick with delivery and it arrived WAY ahead of schedule (great and 5 stars for service) The book of course is old so has wear but it gives it character. I can ammend the review once he reads it and gives me feedback but it was on his wish list. He is a outdoorsman and hunter so I hope it will be a hit.
4,Good one,I have bought this to present it to my sister and it really was much better than the picture. It has a very large dial and the color is unique. Everyone loved it to the core...will definitely buy more from this seller.
2,Not for children under 5,"It takes a building engineer to put this together so it is not for the age it states on the product, would be fine for ages 6 up maybe. Instructions are not that great. I bought it for my 4 year olds, put it together for them as they could not do it then after they tore it down I put it in the closet it has been two years maybe I will take it down and try again."
2,Quite a Disappointment,"Based on what I had read about it, I had high expectations for this book, but I struggled to finish this book and only did so because I was so far into it. I was disappointed with the character development and thought the writing style left a little to be desired. The stream of consciousness sentences which changed topic mid-stream were distracting to me, and I often had to read parts over and over again to get an understanding of what was being said. I found the characters to have great potential but overall to be underdeveloped. I especially thought that she could have done more with the relationships of both children with the mother. I didn't mind knowing the ending from the first page, but when I got to the ending, I felt that I didn't know much more than when I started. I was disappointed."
4,Maytime,"The video cassette although old, can be watched. My mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's loves it. Thanks."
4,The wedding of opera & cinema,"Yes, I'm a sucker for the MacDonald/Eddy musicals & this is their best. ""Maytime"" weds opera & cinema like never before & never since (too bad the wedding didn't last). Not only is the Page's scene from ""les Huguenots"" incorporated, but also a long opera scene from ""Czaritsa"" [composed specifically for this film] is included. This is pretty high-brow stuff, especially for its day! Jeanette MacDonald looks gorgeous as ever & sings magnificiently. Nelson Eddy wears too much makeup as usual but..what a voice! For a film historian this movie is indispensible. Otherwise, , these movies aren't for everyone's tastes but if you have a sweet tooth like me, then indulge!"
5,A Magical Glimpse Back in Time through this Musical Masterpiece of Nostalgic Entertainment,"Even though nearly 75 years have passed since the height of the careers of Nelson Eddy and Jeannette MacDonald this masterful production of ""May Time"" from the MGM Music Library, is a tribute to an era in the movie and entertainment world. Note this video is from the 1937 black and white filming.Well staged, beautiful costumes, and glorious music demonstrate the spectacular drawing power of the extraordinary talent of Nelson Eddy and Jeannette MacDonald. Thoroughly enjoyable."
4,More than happy,"When I bought this vhs, I was not expecting such a quality in sounds and clearness. This film was made in the 30 after all. And what made me happier is that the story keep us awakened from the beginnig till the end. The lovely voice of Jeanette MacDonald is an enchantment in all the opera'a arias she sings. Nelson Eddy is also good, but not enough to be the opera singer they expected from him. But what a story! And, woudl it be only for Jeanette lyrics and her fascinating eyes, it is worted more than the price I paid for it. Three times BRAVO!"
5,MAYTIME,"This is one of Jeanette MacDonald's and Nelson Eddy's best piece of work. I have watched the film many times and enjoy watching it again and again. The musical pieces are at their best. The costumes by Adrian are incredible. I can't say enough about this movie. I'm sure anyone that watches it will add it to their personal collection, as I have."
4,THE FAVOR,"FROM THE BACK COVER:How far would you go to get everything you've ever wanted?After a kiss with a mysterious stranger gets out of control, sensible academic Sierra Gibbs is both frightened and excited by what security specialist Ryder Kane does to her.Would you have phone sex?When Ryder seduces her on her cell phone, Sierra experiences something even more shockingly sinful. And she wants that kind of thrill again...and again.Would you make him an offer he couldn't refuse?Sierra knows Ryder would make the perfect sex partner. His line of work requires him to be daring and impulsive--exactly what she wants in bed.Would you risk your life?But when she gets caught in the middle of the dangerous case he's working on, even the bold new Sierra isn't sure she can handle a man like Ryder. That is, until Ryder starts calling in some favors of his own..."
5,Understanding Chinese Medicine,"This and the companion book, the Materia Medica, are excellent books, for the students of Chinese medicine. This book is understandable to the beginner, as well as an excellent resource for students who are well into their studies."
5,Great workout,"Takes up next to no room and provides a rigorous workout. You can select the level of your workout by the band (each band requires a different amount of effort to stretch), by the exercise you perform and by how many reps you do. The DVD is okay (I usually turn the sound way down), it helps me to keep track of the reps and which exercise to do next.It takes 12-30 minutes for the exercises (depending on whether you do 1, 2 or 3 rounds of exercises) and my fitness level has increased in just a few months of 1 - 2 times per week.It is very easy to take on trips, takes up very little room and adds next to nothing in weight."
3,Is what it is...,"Shipped Fast. More clunky than expected. Adjusting the height/position of the door jam is annoying, unless you want to tick-mark your door for all the different workouts. Commonsense type problems, when you think about what it is...but I didn't. If you are looking for a miracle - this is not it. For what it actually is, however, the material quality is high."
4,The Neighborhood Just Got Better!,"""Roomful is"" at it again, finally! Their long time motto is ""Aim the Beat at Their Feet."" This is a band that blends traditional ""Big band jazz"" with the Blues. The band has changed (evolved) direction with this new release featuring the Blues more than the big band sound. Chris Vachon's smokin' guitar, Mac Odom's soulful voice and holy moley, a ""Horn section to die for."" When do you get to hear a ""trombone or a bari sax"" take the lead. Only when Roomful lets it loose. They are the best kept secret in the business, 28 years in the business. It is a crime that they aren't on Letterman or Leno to showcase the Power that a band like this offers. They can come to my ""Neighborhood"" any time. Don't plan to sit when this CD starts! Their earlier albums are superb: Live at Lupo's will knock you out!"
1,Not a great product,"The stand is made to go with the TV that I bought, and the TV does fit nicely on top of the stand. However that's the only good thing that I can say about it. I'm not going to go into a fit of histrionics, like the other reviewer of this product, but I will say that my cable box hangs off the shelf by about 2 1/2 inches. Also, the stand is so low that I end up having to aim the cable remote at the ceiling in order to bounce the signal to the cable box.I should have been tipped off to the poor sizing of this stand by the fact that the dimensions are not listed anywhere in the product description."
5,Great for what it is...,"I've had this stand for almost a year, and can't complain. It is designed to go with Samsung's 46"" DLP TV. Given this, it is probably the most aesthetically pleasing stand out there for this particular set. It is somewhat tedious to assemble, and the shelves are a bit shallow, but for your average DVD player and cable box, this is fine. I did have to put my receiver on a separate stand off to the side, but I don't like to stack my equipment anyway, so it was a non issue."
2,Useable shelf space minimal.,"While the end product looks fairly nice and is a perfect fit for the Samsung 46 inch TV, like others have expressed here the shelves are just too narrow for most components. The glass shelves are 12 inches wide. Not all that space is usable either, as cables from the back of your components push the devices out from the back wall. A cable TV box ends up sticking out 3 inches over the edge and a surround sound system, two inches. I had to buy another couple of pieces of wider glass to put under them for support. I also have issues with putting the unit together, if you follow the directions you are likely going to end up redoing it all over again. Just study the pictures and figure out the best way to go about it yourself and trash the directions. For the money, I think you can do better with another TV stand."
4,Good deal !,"Matches the 46 inch Samsung Tv perfectly. There is adequate room for about four devices. Bottom shelf is a little low to the ground, but all around great fit."
4,No problems,"Easy assembly. Looks nice. Cable box fits nicely on the shelf. Only thing I have some issue with is the fact that the glass shelving isn't really protected in the back, but that's not a big deal to me. Some tapering of the glass shelves would fix that easily. It does come to a point, so to those of you who have small children who love to explore, it might need to be protected in some way. Overall though this stand is nice especially as it is designed for the HL-S4266 and HL-S4666. Can't go wrong with a custom stand."
2,Not good enough for the price,"It's a rip-off how much they are charging for those TV stands, considering a decent 46"" DLP TV cost $1100 and less. This simple DIY stand is average, at most, in terms of look and quality, and the so-called wire management is just a piece of plastic and double-side sticker. I wouldn't recommend it if you have time to search for other choices."
3,Not deep enough,"The stand was simple enough to put together and it looks really nice. The best thing about this stand is that coupled with my Samsung HL-S4666W, it's difficult to determine where the stand and TV meet. The problem is that it is not deep enough to properly hold my stereo receiver or my 5-Disc DVD player. They both hang out way past the glass shelves and look ridiculous. I'd advise getting a deeper stand if you have deep equipment."
2,Stay away from this,"Do not buy this stand from amazon. The item is ship by Airborne/DHL/USPS. DHL will only attempt to ship it once, then it goes to the USPS and waits for you to pick it up. Just spend the extra 50 bucks and get one from Best Buy or Circuit City. It will look better and are better quality."
5,Thank you for remembering us,"We,who served in the war, appreciate that you took the time towrite a book about us. We, the women who served in WW II, arenow in our golden years. We have our memories and you helpbring back our struggles, defeats, and victories.Thank you for taking the time and patience to write about us."
5,Vision,George Barna always knows how to help churches and pastors fulfill what God has said in His Word.
3,So... SMALL,"I was looking at a bookstore and I wanted to get this, I saw the invisible ink project, the main thing is lemon juice. Lemon juice?? The book is like 6 inches long and 5 inches wide (about). I pictured it being SO big... Cool crafts and games but SMALL."
5,Spanish Lingo for the Savvy Gringo: Review,"This book is definately recommended for adult students of the Spanish language; it's not only witty, but very helpful in understanding slang....this is a must for students. M. Dominguez, Language Instr."
3,Oldie But goody 1950's Puerto Rican and Cuban Popular Music,"The title, ""Nights in Puerto Rico"", seems inapproprieate for this CD. I expected slow and medolic Boleros and alike music that you expect to hear at night with your sweety. It should be more like "" Las Canciones del Ayer"" or the songs from yesteryears... Still, it is a good representation of the popular music heard on the radio stations at the time."
1,Junk,"Normally I don't mind buying third party products, but this cartridge was a complete waste of money. The toner cartridge has a roller that's supposed to evenly apply the toner, and this one screeches and sticks, so that most pages have varying amounts of cyan. As an added bonus, the printer only recognizes it as a 1500, not 4500 page cartridge.I've learned my lesson. Instead of trying to save a few dollars, I'm going to buy a cartridge that works."
3,The CD In Company With The Book Is Not Included,Next Time before I purchase the book I would like to know if the CD in company with the book will be included in the mail or not.
4,"""The great deal.""",I THINK THIS IS AN AWESOME DEAL FOR THE PRODUCT..ITS A VERY AFFODABLE PRICE FOR GOOD QUALITY MECHANDISE..THATS ALL!!
5,AMAZING!!!,"This stuff is amazing! the light matches my skin tone perfectly. it covers everything u want it to and u cant even tell its there! but i threw the sponge away, its useless... I WILL DEFINITELY BUY THIS AGAIN!"
1,Too expensive,"The last time ( last year) I bought Time Balm At a store, it was $6.00. I just paid $18.00 for same amount. I am looking for more reasonably priced substitute"
5,Revolutionary Poetry,"This is the most philosophical poetry that I have ever read, throughout my 46 years of life. It's revolutionary. It took me back through the struggle and my life. This sister is a philosopher who looks inward and takes you with her. The artwork is very deep. I really enjoyed it very much. Thank you sister Nanci."
5,"DEEP, VERY DEEP!","I saw this sister recite for Dr. John Henrik Clark once. She was energetic and exceptional. The sister brought me to my feet. The book displays that same energy. It is so deep, so powerful and so real."
1,protective screen for Coolpix S8100,"The protective cover did not properly fit the screen on my Coolpix S8100, and therefore I did not use it."
2,Not worth the time,"I spent almost 10 years trying to locate this book. What a dissappontment it turned out to be. I'm not going to review how bad the characters where compared to the other books or how the ending was a let down. Other reviews have stated that.What gives it two stars is how the author just seemed to throw away the rules and maked it up as he went along. It's like he never even read the Spelljammers boxed set rules or the AD&D; rules. For several things, glabrezu are not that powerful, nor can they grant the powers that it did, gateways to the abyss cannot be opened in to the phlogiston. A dimension door cannot be open in the phlogiston, nor do they work that way. Astal projection to the phlogiston is also imposible.It's one thing for author's to bend the rules like they do in so many D&D; books but Russ Howards just threw them away."
3,Buy it just to finish the series.,A little on the disappointing side. The previous five books were full of interesting scenes and characters. This book seems to be an effort to quickly wrap up all the loose ends and finish off the series. Buy the book only if you have read the other books and absolutely HAVE to know what happens to Teldin Moore.
5,cant get enough,i have read all of the cloakmaster cycle books and i just love them how ever there needs to be more to the hole than just 6 books if you look for more look up the card game got the books
2,Do not recommend it,"Do not waste your money on this product. The air that comes out from the machine is not strong enough to dry my nail polish quickly, so it takes 15 - 20 minutes for my nails to be completely dry. For the price that I paid I expected the machine to be the same quality as the machines that nail salons have."
5,Best dentist appointment ever!,"I purchased this brush in Feb. and began noticing a difference very quickly after I began using it. My teeth feel cleaner and I love brushing my teeth. I had my first dentist appointment since using the brush about a week ago and it was the best appointment of my life. I used to hate going to the dentist, this was the first time in ages that I haven't had a cavity, and both my hygenist and dentist commented on my ""great brushing""!"
3,Not the best,"Good product but if you have an extra $30, please spend it on a upgraded model. This product will last over 7 years in most cases."
4,Oral B toothbrush rating,"I purchased this toothbrush for my 2 young daughters. It's a great brush head for pediatric (and adult) mouths. They swap out the heads, it's rechargeable and I can stop purchasing junky kids battery-operated toothbrushes every 1-2 months after the batteries wear down. I have used this toothbrush for myself for the past 3 years and no longer have a problem with receding gums or plaque build-up."
4,"Good, solid toothbrush","I like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model. The kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth. It's a bit louder than the older model, probably because it's got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light.Overall, just what we wanted."
3,Not as good Sonicare,"I've got this one and the old Sonicare toothbrush. I bought this one as a replacement for my Sonicare, whose juice has just about run out.Pros: smaller head, cheaper heads, interdental head, cheaper toothbrushCons: not as clean feeling as old Sonicare, battery life is worse, head life is shorter, no quadpacerThe two-speed thing feels useless because the lower speed feels harsher. The spinning brush doesn't do a better job either. Basically, you get what you pay for. Sonicare costs more and is better."
2,Foot safari,"I was expecting more of a biological and geographical account than a rather mundane travel book. What we have is a description of animals and people as the safari progresses, interspersed with impressions of the porters and others on the trip. And some historical background, often relating to dangerous animals in Africa, and the depredations of poachers. Occasional tidbits of biology are thrown in, but this is not like a John McPhee book on the area at all. I found it only mildly interesting. The photographs are by a famous and experienced photographer, and I suppose in their day they were excellent, and probably much better if we could see them as proper scans at high definition. But as prints they leave a lot to be desired. The resolution is not good, nor are the colors for the most part. They seem grainy and insufficiently saturated. So, the book is a disappointment."
3,Don't be so judgemental,"He probably did play every corny sax lick in the book but I kind of liked it because I am not really a jazz expert. Until I can be hailed as one, I don't think it's a crime to enjoy it. In fact, this music can be a great stepping stone for people who can only hear and enjoy simple harmony such as in Rock and Pop music. There are beautiful chords in jazz but if you throw Coltrane embelishments at rock listiners it's like feeding horse radish to a baby."
1,Couldn't Swing Even If He Was Trapped In A Playground!,"Very calculated music. Not jazz in the very least. Arista should be ashamed of releasing the same old thing over and over from this guy. For those of you who want to explore some TRUE jazz and not this stuff, try using your Amazon.com search engine and use the following key words: Brubeck, Miles, Weather Report, Getz, Ellington, McLaughlin, Blakey, Coltrane, Monk, Mingus, Montgomery. Music of this genre is NOT jazz and is barely acceptable as music."
2,to flat and brassy,There is to much emptness in his arrtistry. The sound tract is not appealing to my ear.
2,Sounds like Kenny G is trying to get back to his roots. . .,"Kenny G started off as a darn good jazz saxophonist, but then went commercial. Though he's at least doing some more traditional jazz stuff, some of the classics just shouldn't be messed with, especially in the syrupy, dry commercial way he does them. From a musicians standpoint, he's great at what he's doing, and sure makes a lot of money, but this is ""elevator"" jazz that would bore some of us to tears."
1,And I'm over-rating it at that.,Will someone kindly take that horn from this individual's lips before he hurts someone ELSE?
1,Huh???,"Why would anyone want to here this junk when the originals are available?This is nothing more than Kenny G watering down the classics into bland, white bread sleeping pills, which is all his so called music is anyway."
4,Kenny G does it again!!!!!!,Thanks for the tribute. It is a pleasure to stroll down memory lane with Kenny. This CD is a MUST buy.
5,Hmmm,"Kenny G is an awsome musician and i say its okay if you dont like is music. We are all entitled to our own opinions. But dont disrespect the person because thats what most of you did. If you find his music to be distasteful, then listen to those you know you like. point blank. and for those of you who said he should be ashamed because he dubbed his music over louis armstrong, he has nithing to be ashamed about."
1,From Alpha to Omega in one CD,"Before listening to this album, I had not heard Kenny G. play. After listening to this album, I have no intention of ever listening to Kenny G. again. Enough said."
2,If you've had a cavity filled...you've heard this CD,Dentists think this CD helps their patients relax. It doesn't. Makes me demand general anesthesia just so I don't have to listen to it. As if going to the dentist wasn't torture enough already.
1,I WOULD RATHER HAVE AN ENEMA WITH GASOLINE,I WOULD RATHER HAVE AN ENEMA WITH GASOLINE THAN HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS AWFUL THING CALLED AN ALBUM.
1,Kenny G! The Greatest of All Time!,"Sure, Kenny G is a joke as a musician, and even more so now since he disrespected one of the most important figures in American music. What it proves to us is that good music can never be heard or accepted by the general public, and that people like Mr. G can earn an incredibly good living creating the cooljazzpopcrap that commercially is so successful. What surprises me is not how ignorant Mr. G is, but how much we buy into this sorry excuse for music. In actuality, with most of commercial music consisting of really bad singers and artificial songs, it shouldn't really surprise me at all."
3,OK if you like this kind of music...,"I'm sure people who like laidback, reliably competent background music would like this album very much. Kenny G does what he does well - he doesn't do anything particularly good or particulary bad, just competent. I would not call this jazz, as it doesn't really contain much real improvisation and there are no complex rhythms or chords. But if you are not interested in really exciting jazz, or want something to play in the background at a dinner party, or at a date etc. etc, this is just fine."
1,Can I select no stars for a rating.,"This was cd was a complete insult to the jazz masters.The scary thing about this, other smooth jazz artists are going to copy this CD & add further insult & a show of disgrace to the jazz greats & disrespect this beautiful art form known as JAZZ!"
1,"Horrible, worthless, disgrace to jazz.","After regaining consciousness from this noise, I took time to write this biting letter. I don't know why Kenny continues to sell millions of records. He's not a band leader, his music is simple and watered down, he did nothing original to these pieces, except put the Kenny G touch to it. Bleach and a wire brush won't get the filth off now. At least the jazz masters he disrespected are dead and can't hear the mess Kenny's made."
1,What A Wonderful World,What a wonderful world this would be if we didn't ever have to listen to Kenny G.
1,Not even very good easy-listening,"I really didn't know what to expect when I listened to this album, but I honestly didn't expect Kenny G to butcher these classic tunes. He didn't do justice to the selections at all, and he frequently didn't even play the changes correctly. He should have realized that attempting to put out an album like this means he's subject to criticism from every learned jazz fan in the world. How arrogant of him to not even shed the tunes enough to play them properly. For those of you who want Kenny G, listen to his pop recordings. This one's not worth your while."
1,Key of G?,"As best as I remember off the top of me 'ead ""Summertime"" is in A minor, ""The Look of Love"" is in D minor, ""The Girl from Ipanema"" is in F, ""Body and soul"" is in C, ""Round Midnight"" is in Bb minor, and ""Over the Rainbow"" is in Eb (at least George Shearing does it in Eb). My advice: First get a last name, then learn to play.Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns. (It'll help you learn to play--or make you play better--in EVERY key.)"
4,It took me back,"A lot of old time music is lost to most of us. This CD brought back of thoughts of wonderful times. I'm not a big jazz fan, but I like, not necessarily Keeny G, but the group of songs he put in one place. This is reflection music. I'm not a critic, just a happy music listener who got enjoyment from this CD. Is not this what it's all about?"
5,Great!!,"I absolutley love Kenny G. This c.d. was Kenny G's interprations of some of the great classics. He added his own special twist. This cd just like all of his other cds are for SMOOTH JAZZ lovers not hardcore Jazz Purists if that is what you call yourselves. There are thousands out there that love and admire Kenny G. for his great works. I am one who appreciates what Kenny does for music, PERIOD!! So stop hating on the brother cause he is going to continue to stack them dollars!!"
3,"""G"" Whiz!","While I have never been a particularly big fan of Kenny G, I have, over the years, appreciated his skills with the sax. I guess where I sometimes feel let down is with his selections of tunes. I found this CD to above average in song selection and particularly loved the Louis Armstrong ""What a Wonderful World"" cut. But I just don't get why we have to hear ""The Girl from Ipanema"" two times. True, they are two different cuts, but it's still the same song! It just seems that the producers just had to fill some space...the second version isn't even listed among the song titles or credited in the song pamphlet! I feel this is unfair to the listener and it really insults my intelligence. I would have hoped that one rendition would suffice and that another song should had been added instead. THERE MUST BE SOME SONG OUT THERE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED! What gives? But, not to turn the listener off totally, since there are several good cuts on the CD, I'll give it 3 stars."
1,You have to look for the telling little slips,"to see where people are coming from with their music. Like the guy who gave it 5 stars and said it was great to fall asleep to. Personally, I prefer music that makes me sit up and take notice, not act as the aural equivalent of a sleeping pill."
1,Hostess Twinkie!,"This vapid release is the audio equivalent of a Hostess Twinkie-sugary, short on nutrition and not very filling. People that think Kenny G plays the sax well also think that Twinkies and jug wine are essential components of fine dining and that tractor pulls constitute high art."
1,Mystery,"Why on earth would anybody what this tripe when the originals are so much better? This is a mystery, and people need to see that more classics aren't butched by Mr. G."
1,kenny g fan must buy! easy listening and relax.,"i'm not kenny g fan.i buy this album ""classics in the key of g""because i love to listen the great producer""david foster""play piano on ""what a wonderful world""and my favourrite singer ""louis armstrong . i buy this album in my home town from ""boss laser music""on 02/07/99"
2,Nothing to write home about.,"This was nice, smooth, not something I would rave about and tell others to buy. I personally prefer his own compostions. Please Kenny, I hope your artistic well hasn't run dry."
1,Yuck,Dentist office muszak of the worst kind from that cultural nemisis Kenny G. Listneing to this is as about as exciting as eating Velvetta and Cheese Whiz on Melba Toast.
1,Dreary,"Dreary, depressing, and completely reprehensible, this CD is further evidence that Kenny G is nothing more than a dupe in the never ending quest to homogenize American culture into a shopping mall persona, devoid of any creativity and substance. It is a sad day when watered down music such as this gripes the masses."
1,It's so smooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooth!!!!!!!!!,This album by Kenny G is so smooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooth!!!!!!!!! It is the smoooooooooooooooooooothest album I know. And I love smooooooooooooooooooooooooth albums!
1,get the original recordings of these songs,"The only thing this cd me made do is appreciate Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon more. Make the effort and give these cats a listen."
1,The Worst,THis has to be the worst album since.....well the last Kenny G album. An insult to the jazz legends it seeks to pay tribute to.
1,"Going Fishing again, Kenny?","A fisherman has his fishing rod, Kenny G has his horn. Keep on fishing Kenny, I hope you catch something soon!...real soon!"
1,Not good jazz,"This CD disturbs me because it spreads and reinforces various pieces of misinformation. For one, Kenny G did not start out as a jazz saxphonist (as someone stated here). He was always pop, never learned to play jazz, or wanted to be considered jazz, as even he claimed. Also, for those people who say ""but these are nice old songs and he plays them so well"" I say you probably haven't ever heard the originals as played by the great jazz artists of this century (and they are ALL available on CD). There's no good reason for this record to exist except possibly as a launching pad for the thousands and thousands of musically depraved plebians out there."
1,Avoid,"Dull, bland, and utterly unchallenging, this album of music would also be forgettable if it wasn't so blatantly offensive. That this purveyor of Muzak sleeping pills has taken on some of the classics of jazz and turned them into safe and unexciting suburban sprawl that may seem harmless on the surface, but it is ultimately is a part of the steady drive to water down all the compelling aspects of American culture. It is up to YOU to put a stop to this. Please avoid!"
1,This is a good CD for...,"This is a good CD to buy if you think you like music, but don't really know anything about it. If you don't just have bad taste, but no taste at all, then you will love this CD. Buy it!"
1,Pretty Pathetic,Maybe we should all go to New Orleans and listen for the sound of Louis Armstrong rolling over in his grave.
1,The worst of all,"It's the wrost of all Kenny G's music I can ever find. I was a great Kenny G fan and got really disappointed and regret after buying this first of my Kenny G CD, and it will probably be the last one ever. However, I still like him in some of the CDs I've listen to in Asia. I'm still searching for those great CDs..."
1,Does anybody have a kleenex?,"This is just sad, sad, sad. Please don't do this again, Kenny. Please! Save the children!"
1,- infinite stars,"I did not hear in my whole (adult) life such a caricature (music?). It is funny I can not stopped laughing for hours that people pay money to listen such thing.This cd is for me the 0 point, the reference to compare everything to see if it is positive.If anybody discover a most awful thing please contact me."
1,"What a Sad, Sick World...","...when somone like Mr. Gorelick can come along and in one fell swoop defecate on anything transcendant about music. What he has in fact done is marginalized the struggle of every musical artist in the 20th century by spitting on the grave of Louis Armstrong. Pat Metheney called it musical necrophilia. I have to agree. Kenny G's ego has consumed his own soul and has now started hungrily devouoring our common musical heritige and corrupting our culture. Please, if you still believe in anything sacred in this sad, sick world, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM."
1,It is too bad you cannot give less than 1 star.,"Too bad it was not Kenny G instead of Art Farmer or Milt Jackson last year. Kenny G's punishment for this piece of dreck should be that he gets to listen to it for all of eternity. Actually, I have never heard this music, but know enough about this whole smooth jazz movement to know what it is about. How dare Mr G (or whatever his name is) dare to record jazz standards. Gimme a break. Miles would be turning in his grave to see what has become of the great tradition."
1,This is an amazing CD,"I simply cannot say enough. His saxophone's tone is spectacular, and his melodies are languid and sensuous. Furthermore, I love the beautiful drum machine loops, and the keyboard synths.His playing is right up there with every single one of the jazz masters."
1,Not RESPECTABLE,"How in the world can Kenny G call himself playing jazz. I go to the store every once in awhile to look at jazz albums, and I remove his stuff to the easy listening section. BUT THIS TIME HE BLEW MY MIND BY PUTTING THE GREAT LOUIS ARMSTRONG ON HIS [weak] ALBUM! He deliberately disgraced the jazz grandfather known as Louis Armstrong. I also don't like this album because he tried to play standards such as Round Midnight, Body and Soul, The Girl from Ipamena etc. Kenny G is not a jazz musician, and I CAN'T believe how he has most of the United States fooled into what he thinks jazz should really sound like, and what he thinks a saxophone player should really sound like. It was like he gave the jazz musicians of today the finger. Kenny G is a disgrace to all saxophone players of past and present. I hate when someone tells me after a concert that I almost sound as good as Kenny G. We all know who the real Kenny G is, and that's Kenny Garrett better known as G Man...."
4,soothing background music,This album seems to be irritating people for some reason. I disagree; it's good for trying to fall asleep or sitting in the tub. It's soothing that's the point. For dinner music I would pick something else though.
4,So what???,"When I get into my vehicle after a long day at work, I like to listen to something soothing and relaxing. The songs in this album do exactly that. I especially like the blend of Kenny G's sax and the smooth voice of the Master, Louis Armstrong. The purists of the world have voiced their indignation - but for the common ear, I love it. Sorry."
1,Please leave the CLASSICS alone!,"My rate is minus five stars...Is there anybody to tell Kenny G that all those musics are perfect before he was born? Why the owners of the titles rights allowed this crime? This is an insult to the memory of Louis Armstrong, Antonio Carlos Jobim and all the others. JR from Portugal."
1,This Really Hurts,"Hearken to my words. Usually I'd let someone wallow in mediocrity without any kind of comment or retribution, but I can't.(Disclaimer) Style of playing and musical styles in general can be a very subjective thing. But, this is not good enough for easy listening, this is not ""close enough for Jazz"" and circular breathing is no big deal.Like ""Hooked on Classics"" this CD lacks soul, character, class and technique. It is as if Mr. G was told to play at gunpoint. It is offensive for people to think this is Jazz, of any kind. It is more akin to the porno of the music world.So what could be next? Maybe ""Grunge in the Key of G"" or ""(Insert Band Name) in the Key of G""."
1,...,"What a Wonderful World is a standout track. Kenny G makes it sound much better than the original. On In a Sentimental Mood, Kenny G makes his sax sing better than Duke could make his piano sing. Round Midnight is even better than the version done by Miles and Coltrane back in 1956."
1,musac is a personal experience,"i enjoy Kenny G's music, always have. music is a personal experiences and for those that don't like it, well..don't listen to it! let the people that appreciate his music alone."
1,too smooth for my ears,"If I were God, Kenny G would be damned to Eternal perdition for such an abomination."
4,Very relaxing!,I found this CD very relaxing! I listened to it while giving birth to my son. It really made the whole atmosphere calm. The nurses enjoyed it also. A couple of them wanted to know which CD of Kenny's it was.
1,G Whiz,"I cannot stand what this man has done to these classics, especially ruining ""What A Wonderful World"". Poor Louis must be rolling over in his grave."
4,Smither Live,What can I say but I love this album. I have not had the opportunity to see Chris play live but if I close my eyes I can imagine that he is in my living room playing for my family and I. This is a really good album with a wide selection of tracks that are found on other albums but the live nature of the recordings adds a little something in my mind. Great album.Gerry
3,Not Bad,Not Bad. Not great. Some cuts I can leason to over and over. Others I would skip through. I would buy again for the good once. This is a double CD and worth the money.
4,A Collection Of Old Ragtime And Boogie Woogie Recordings.,"This is a collectors' album. There, I've said the code words indicating that the album has issues. This 2 CD set of Ragtime and Boogie Woogie songs were recorded back in the 1920's, 1930's, and 1940's, before mastertapes and the words ""high fidelity"" were even invented, so you have to put up with the sometimes scratchy sound and low fidelity. It's time to put your tone controls or graphic equalizer to work and experiment to find the best settings to make the music more presentable. Put a note listing the best settings inside the CD case for future reference. These recordings are so old and out of print that you won't find them anywhere else, but they show the feelings and intensity of the oldtime performers trying to scratch out a living doing what they do best. Could the sound quality on the album have been better? Who knows. It is what it is. Let's all be grateful that these original recordings are still available."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"I just should send it back. The sound quality is 20's 30's. Tinny and little bass. Great songs, but less than desirable."
5,"Deddie Romero, La Reina De La Musica Tropical!","A la verdad que Deddie Romero todo lo que canta lo hace perfectamente bien. Tanto en la salsa como en el merengue. RMM hizo un exelente trabajo en este el primer disco de merenguera de Deddie. Una mezcla de sabor, romance, ritmo, y pasion componen este disco. Otro exito mas en la carrera de ""La Salserita"" Deddie Romero."
1,"DON""T BUY IT!","The lotion/lubricant smells! If you don't mind that stink on your face all day, this is a close shave. Don't forget= once you buy this shaver, ""they gotcha"". You have to keep buying more BRAUN lubricant (stinky) cartridges."
5,freeglider,"Great product!wanted to get a new shaving head ,but found I could get a new shaver for just a little more! Suplier was quick and efficient.product arrived ahead of shedule!KM"
4,Great Topical Skin Treatment,"This is an easy-to-apply spray that seems to have some emollient qualities, which probably attribute to its healing properties. Smells a bit like tea tree oil, which seems to be a bit of a deterrent to licking, so the medicine stays on the wound a bit longer."
1,Sucks,My dog developed a rash after a couple of sprays. The itch from the rash was worst than the original hot spot.
3,Hooky concept produces some good and bad Modern music,"The Mississippi River of Song / a musical journey down the Mississippi (Folkways): This 2 CD set is supposedly only one part of a various media presentation. I have only experienced this 2 CD set and so my review is based on it alone. The whole idea of Modern recordings being done by all sorts of bands that are supposed to represent the music found as you go down the Mississippi seems unmanageable to begin with, but the concept ultimately fails in these recordings. There are a few good songs here and there but the randomness of these performances are only mildly entertaining. The educational value of this set is completely dependent on someone explaining the `journey', which is not done within the albums themselves. No doubt the film of this project uses these songs well and perhaps again these CDs are here only to give the uneditied songs to those who have seen the film, but as an independent set of songs, this isn't very good. Three Stars"
4,Excellent book,"Excellent book ! but its price is too high, not affordable for everyone. Hence I vote for 4 stars."
2,"Poor written, very repetitive. Only good for no programming experience","It is amazing that majority only vote helpful if someone says good things about the book. The readers may already make up the own mind before reading the review.The book is way too long because it is very repetitive. It shows you very simple things. Programming is not hard, I can imagine a relative smart kid can learn C++ or even assembly in 10 yo. There is no need to spend many pages to explain a simple idea again and again. The sample examples are very long and have no insight at all. The author may be a beginner of C++ himself. If you have absolutely no programming experience in your life, this book may be fine. However, if you have even little experience of programming, I recommend you buy the Accelerated C++ by Andrew Koenig. It is many times better than this book and you spend much less time to read but you gain more insight how to program C++."
1,Worst C++ book ever,"Do yourself a favor. Buy ""The C++ Programming Language"" by Stroustrup instead of this one."
3,C++ primer plus is better,"For the students who want to learn C++, the book C++ primer plus isway much better than this one (and also a lot cheaper). This book isgetting bigger and bigger. It tries to explain everything in one book, which, to my oppion, is a big mistake. No one can fully comprehend every aspect of C++ in one book. As a textbook, it needs to be more focused. In this sense, the book C++ primer plus (remember there is a ""plus"") is superior than this one. You may want to check my review on the book C++ primer plus (and also my review on C++ primer).This book is way too expensive for poor college students. The color pages look good, but you paid $$$$$ for that."
2,"For beginners 2 starts, otherwise 0 star","I have this book and many other C++ books, have to say, Nay.Definitely not for professional programmers.Maybe OK for beginners, I am not too sure. Cause I think there are a few other books out there, that are better organized.Only bright point: print quality is really good, formatting and page quality."
3,Good but should be avoided,"This book does some things right and some things wrong.Positive: excellent use of color and generally well written and its nice how the key words are in bold.Negative: its code examples are convoluted. Instead of concisely demonstrating a new concept, it has long winded code that includes a lot of unnecessary fluff. As a result, the user must wade through a lot of code to understand a concept that is ellucidated in several lines. Also, the author is verbose. Extremely verbose. Long winded is an understatement.Get something else. It's just too long."
2,Dry and Boring,"I bought this book because of all the good reviews. Unfortunately the book just puts me to sleep. I found it very boring and uninspiring. Though I wanted to learn the material in here, the book just doesn't connect with me. No bigee, I'll try another one. At $3 plus shipping it's worth a shot."
5,Very good introduction for Patterns,This is one of the best books I have ever read on patterns and object oriented programming. It gives you a new perspective about design and helps you to write your programs with change in mind. I highly recommend it.
1,Significant lack of substance,"OK, OK, granted that I spend my life around design patterns. But I expected a book with the title Design Patterns Explained to explain. Instead it seems to be soft and without many examples. I bought it with the hope that it would help my endeaver to finish a design patterns workbook but found no substance that I could gleam.It also lacks a full coverage of the 23 design patterns in the GOF book.Buy the book if you only want an overview, otherwise go through the pain of the GOF book Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. It is cryptic and hard to grasp but the substance is there."
4,Good.. but Too Expensive,"A sweet little introduction to Design Patterns focusing not only on the technical side but also on the ""philosophical"".Great first book for a beginner. Read it cover to cover in a weekend and you will start seeing that object oriented programming is not only about extending classes. Only downside of this book: the price. For what you will find inside it is worth about $....."
2,"Maybe a good introduction book, but far from its title","I borrowed this book from USC library for one friend. I browsed it for a little while. Although this book gets very good rating on the book site, but I didn't find it useful to me at all.As a good book about design, as the title indicated, the author should explain more about why a design change is needed, and the consequences of this change. But unfortunately, the author just simply ""applied"" a design pattern to his sample. I doubt if he really knows the result of this change.We are facing a changing world, and the system requirements always change. That's why we need design patterns to make our system flexible to these changes. The author use design patterns as a tool to fix a bad design. That is the lowest form to use design patterns. The author should do better than that to name his book ""A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design""..."
5,couldn't stop reading,"I bought this book to start using design patterns.I didn't really know what I should expect, but what I gotwas awesome.Once started, I couldn't stop reading this book! It's contentis so interesting and is written clearly and exciting.Shalloway and Trott give a good view of what design patterns are,what they can be used for, and how to use them!Everybody who wants to get started with design patterns...buy this book! The Gang of Four book is a great reference,but this book is an even better introduction."
3,Only for Beginners,"It's a nice book but...As one reviewer mentioned ""Chapter 1 and 2 are of little value to experienced OO developers"". Let me say it stronger - the whole book is for OO/DesignPatterns beginners. It really adds some new comments explaining well-known patterns but if you read GoF book and implemented some of those patterns you hardly discover something new.Indeed there is some fresh interpretation of Alexander book but for developer all this boils down eventually to a couple of principles and a dozen of patterns (may be I'm wrong).To sum up: if you are new to Design Patterns ideas then it's an excellent introduction, however otherwise look for something more advanced."
4,A sad novel of the plight of a maid and her path to triumph,"The heroine of this novel is truly beaten down by her birth status over and over she loses but holds her triumph in her camelia white skin, her gypsy heart and her only child. Finding joy in the little things in life is all that keeps her going. This book takes a harsh look at class value, Self worth, and the treatment and expectations of women in the the early part of the century. It teaches one to look at the bright side of life no matter how tarnishd it may be. It also made me feel lucky to be in this era where it is much harder to be pushed under by other's prejudices. It is a life lesson to remember so it can't happen in our society again!"
2,Don't cout on these,You'd think this product just lights right up and helps start your fire. Wrong. It doesn't. I wasted 3 good matches trying to get this to light. I finally had to cut it up into slivers and start my fire the old fashion way. I wouldn't carry these with me on my next backpacking adventure.FYI - people who review shipping costs in product reviews must not be very bright.
2,No good for Wii,"The format of the switch is great, and it is too bad that (at least through component cables) it is not compatible with the Wii. That's because it loses video sync on extremely bright signals, like the Wii's pure-white menu.It also appears to blow-out the highlights of DVD video sources, and loses sync on over-bright video signals from DVD as well.So basically, I am returning this unit and trying to find something that does not interfere with my component imagery."
4,Decent Game System Receiver for the price,For the price it cannot be beat. Good for organizing multiple game systems. Wished it had a few more ports for my other game systems I have.
1,Unacceptable,"For the most part, this product does what it says, however, during certain parts of movies the screen get this weird effect where a large black rectangle moves from the bottom to the top of the screen. It seems to happen where the screen changes drastically from dark to bright lighting, but I haven't nailed it down. It REALLY ruined the experience of the movies we were watching. However, it's the only product out there that does this at this price point. It was unacceptable to us though, and it is now sitting in storage. I don't want to resell it to someone, because it really is not something people should be using until they fix that problem."
4,"Works Great, Would Recommend!!","I researched many of these selectors, not knowing which one to buy! I ended up buying the Pro System Pelican Selector. I works great for what we need it for! Very easy to hook up and I love that it comes with a remote! The only drawback is I do notice a very thin line going up the TV, but I am used to it now. Would definitely recommend this!!"
2,It doesn't look good!!!,"The picture Quality looks bad, so I got better A/V cables to connect the dam thing to the T.V, which seemed to work the cable they send you is garbage. Also with the Selector my Time Warner cable works fine and looks descent now that I added better wires. I plugged my PS3 and Xbox 360 into it and they look fine but no sound comes out I am still trying to figure out the problem, I even plugged it into the port where i have the Time Warner Cable is which I know works fine, but still no sound."
1,WARNING: ONLY 3 OPTICAL DIGITAL AUDIO INPUTS!,"I ordered this hunk of garbage based on the misleading product description, only to discover that the thing has a grand total of 3 optical digital audio inputs.I guess they don't expect that we'd want to listen to anything from the other two component video inputs.The lack of audio inputs for the other 40% of the inputs renders the device worthless to me. Hope I can spare you the wasted time purchasing and then instantly returning one."
4,Very detailed,"I bought this after seeing the 2011 eponymous movie (""A Dangerous Method"") which stirred me to get more information about the people in it, especially Spielrein, Gross, Jung, & Freud. Although my PhD is in clinical psychology and I went through a long psychoanalysis (""ego psychology flavor""), all that was before much of the information presented in this book was uncovered and came to light.Kerr's book is based on his PhD dissertation and sometimes seems not far removed from that style. It has patches, like puddles after a scattered heavy rain, that are extremely detailed and which would be tedious reading for any but, e.g., the very few needing those details for their references such as the master's thesis on which they're working. However one can skip over those sections and resume reading where the text resumes a more narrative approach. I'm not sorry at all that I read the book and appreciate that it supplied most of the information I wanted as well as spurring me to find out more."
5,"Saw the movie, now reading the book","Love the book, its much better than the movie, with alot more details. Book was in great shape and arrived on time"
2,"Like the book linked to ""Dangerous Beauty,"" this isn't a movie novel","If you are expecting a novelized treatment of the drama between Freud and Jung over treatment of a controversial patiient (like I was), think again. This reads more like a textbook, or a research report on ancestry using lots of records. I couldn't get through two pages, and I read some really dull mathematics texts. I was expecting drama and personal conflict, not a recounting of facts. Blame me for being too shallow and vapid for a scholarly discussion, when I was looking for drama. It is not a bad book, I am sure, for some one interested in serious scholarly research without scandal and sin. I admittedly was looking for both, and returned the book."
4,Works well,This was bought for trash when we go camping. We put bags in it before use. But it should be tied down or tied to something in windy places... It is very lightweight.We do like that is foldable and washable.
4,solid choice of readings,"Contrary to the opinion of the fellow who gave this book 1 star, this book has an excellent selection of essays from many key 20th century thinkers (including three essays and 1 extract from Heidegger, which should be enough to undermine the critic's credibility). For the most part, they are presented unedited in full. Many of the selections are must-reads for people who wish to understand particular periods in the history of modern architecture, and it is nice to have them all together under a single cover."
4,A great sourcebook,"The editor of the books is to be congratulated for compiling all the key texts of the leading Continental philosophers on the topics of architecture, urbanism, or the built environment per se. Whether or not you are smitten by the so-called Continental philosophy -- a loosely connected group of twentieth century figures mostly active in Germany and France, from Heidegger and Adorno through Foucault and Derrida -- you can't deny that they have decisively influenced the contemporary architectural discourse. It's useful to have most of the relevant writings available in one volume."
1,Outrageously bad.,"There's no suspenseful or horrifying moment in this film. The special effects are like those of a low-budget zombie movies. I mean, you can see human being with dark painted faces walking stiffly. That's it. The dialogues and acting are stiff.In short there's nothing intersting."
4,nazi zombies,"Pretty good, if your a nazi or zombie fan as i am. i could definately see a normal person being very bored by this as its not terribly exciting, but i think that also adds to the realism. not your typical action shootemup. good story. THE ZOMBIES DONT DIE! Absolutely hopeless situation. worth a buy especially if you can get it for just a few bucks."
4,A pleasant surprise,"Someone say something about Nazi zombies? That's kind of what you'll find here in Outpost, in which a crew of mercs (led by Ray Stevenson of HBO's Rome and soon to be seen in Punisher: War Zone) are led to a bunker where the Nazi's did experiments years before in hopes of creating unkillable soldiers. Well guess what? They succeeded, and soon enough, the crew is haunted and stalked by these unkillable Nazi monsters. It doesn't sound like anything special, but Outpost actually manages to be suspenseful and very nicely paced. It also provides a decent amount of bloody violence to boot, and there's enough creepy moments to hold your interest as well. All in all, Outpost is definitely worth a look for horror/suspense fans looking for a little something different."
4,number 2 better,"first in series,good 2nd better,well worth-it own it become fan.premis nazi machine makes indestructable undead soldiers.they move through field generated by machine military and dying nazi battle for it.great fun that gets better trust me."
4,Zombies?,"For the most part I thought that the movie was good. Good group for the mercs. I liked how the group was consistant with the weapons. It appeared to me that the medic and the leader had similar weapons and the rest of the group all had the same type of weapon. Very impressed. They had claymores, why didn't they have greanades? I don't think I would call this a zombie movie though. Supernatural probably. When I think of a zombie movie I think of flesh eating!"
3,OUTPOST,"CLEVER IDEA, EVIL NAZI PURSUIT OF POWER THRU SCIENCE AND/OR OCCULT.VERY DISTURBED AND CREEPY, GOOD ACTING, GOOD ACTION, BUT SORT OF PETERS OUT AT THE END. WATCHABLE FLICK, THO SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A HORROR CLASSIC."
4,"Low budget, but creepy as heck","I liked Ray Stevenson's character, his partner and the scientist they brought along. The rest of the mercenaries I could probably outclass with random people taken off the street. Somewhat unbelievable that they were battle-hardened mercs. That aside... even with the low budget of the movie, the horror factor was fairly impressive. The story line held together, the ""opposition"" is frightening as heck, and the inability to ever really see them clearly is that much more creepy."
4,Solid film-making,"I found this movie almost by accident, but it's quickly becoming a favorite. The setting and story are quite believable, the film-making is solid, the writing is very good and the acting is just right. I couldn't believe it when I was told the movie was made with only $400,000. It just goes to show you that it doesn't take a studio budget and a lot of effects to tell a good story, just a tight script, some humble actors who aren't afraid to get dirty, and a skilled eye behind the camera. I absolutely loved this movie. If you like a good suspense/horror film, this will be right up your alley too."
1,"Outpost: A slow, tedious place to visit","I'm a fan of Romero, the various homages and spoofs--Sean of the Dead, Fido, et. al.--but found this film slow and tedious. By the time the gore came, I found little to care about or react to. The idea of a Nazi experiment to create an invisible, perhaps indestructible army seems somewhat threadbare by now. It was creepy thirty, twenty or even ten years ago. This isn't the worst movie ever made, just a disappointing one."
3,It had its moments,This is worth a rental but I would not buy it. I like Ray Stevenson and this is why we rented the movie. He does a good job and makes a believable merc.The film does build suspense but I did not care for the ending. It was almost anti climatic. Music score was not bad.Also I thought the movie seemed to go by very fast.
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't Waste your money on this movie. Plain and simple. When the ""Good"" guys finaly confront the Nazis is when the movie goees south, and it goes south quick. Terrible. Worst chunk of change I have spent on a movie."
2,Nazi never die!,The story begins a group of Mercanaries who are hired to find some old bunker where Nazi experiments where conducted. They discover that the guy who hired them are looking for more than some gold. There dealing with the supernatural and physics to create some super soldier. Well of course they awaken the soldiers that protect this place and are taken out one by one. The story had real potential of being so much more but it did'nt. The acting was good and the effects where not bad either. The story just was kind of boring and the pay off was no that great. You just kept waiting for something more. I will say this you might want to rent it but not much more if even that.
4,Suprisingly Good,"When I first saw the box for this at Walmart I thought it was probably straight to DVD movie that was going to be along the lines of Zombie Strippers and be just trash. Then I watched Punisher War Zone and liked it. When doing some research on Ray Stevenson I saw something about this movie and it said he was in it and that it got pretty favorable reviews. So I decided to give it a chance and purchased it. It suprised the heck out of me. This was a good movie. It was shot well. It was different. It had good acting and it had a good story. It was different from your normal horror movie or your normal zombie movie if that it what you want to catergorize it as. Ray Stevenson is really good in these kind of roles and should be an excellent action/drama star. The guy can act and has a physical and charismatic presence.I recommend this to horror fans, fans of war pics and just plain action fans. Give it a shot you won't regret it."
2,Not worth the money.,"The movie had decent production value, but lacked creativity. Writing was straight forward, but uneventful. Would not recommend it to anyone. Not bad, but as one reviewer said, ""dissapointing."""
2,Not a zombie movie,"I bought this movie thinking it was a zombie movie. It is more of a ghost story with mercs in it. It said soldiers that couldn't be destroyed, so naturally I thought zombies and proceeded to buy it. So if you like a ghost story with soldiers here is your movie!"
5,very nice,I wear silk underneath. I wouldn't think of wool as a base layer but this is nice and soft. It smelled from the dye but after a wash it was good. made in ..... well you probably know.
4,Solid baselayer for colder temps,I purchased this initially for a costume but now have found myself wearing it more and more. Solid turtleneck thats not itchy and feels great against the skin.
1,Sucks,The plot of this movie was average for a sci-fi film but it was totally ruined by the bad acting and the bad CGI. The creatures seemed to have been cut out of paper and the producers just made them move.
1,Bottom of the Barrel,"The acting is horrible and the CGI is really awful, just awful. Toward the end they are doing a shot on green screen where they are supposed to be in front of a roadway tunnel and all of a sudden you see a van drive right out of the tunnel and through the actors. They did not go to the trouble to remove it from the stock shot. Just awful."
2,Just above a Roger Corman flick.......,"I really really wanted this movie to work. i turned blindly to all theplot holes, bad acting, bad cgi and still that was'nt enought.Probably for the little money they had, they only could do soo much.I dont know whose fault it was...but it seemed the actors/actresses didnot care too much and were just going through the motions and wait fortheir paycheck.....So the stars go for the work done on the dinosaurs by the specialeffect teams.This movie was done by Asylum studios...and from what i see from theirpreviews they sure have great stories to tell but with small budgetsand minimun actors/actresses....A rental only.....Dont waste your hard earned cash!"
1,this movie was extremely bad...,"wow... the concept and idea is great! I wanted to like this SO much, but as soon as they got to the past and we got a glimpse of the dinos, i knew i was in for a rough ride. the effects kept cracking me up. When the main dinosaur was stomping after the people, the cheesy screen blur effect for every footstep got obnoxious though. In all honesty, i stopped watching it because i didn't feel like wasting anymore of my time. Best way to enjoy this movie? Pop some shrooms and press play."
3,Ok and Fun,Another Spoof from the Asylum Film Company. 100 Million BC spoofs 10000 BC as you can guess but has nada to do with the story of the Roland Emmerich Film.A Way to travel through time has been discovered and a team is sent back in time to study Dinosaurs. Years later thay have benn missing for some time and a new team is sent to find them and bring them home but thay also bring a Tyrannosaurus into Modern Suberbia.The Story is an intrestig journey but the film lacks quit a bit. The CG is decent but is still very Comic-Book looking. The acting is medicore as Christopher Atkins saves the film. Like all the other Asylum films it is classified as C-Grade Cenima but does an ok job with itself. Not a film for High-Octaine Sci-Fi or Horror Fans.
3,Time Travel and dinosaurs,"Special effects on the dinosaurs in this are not real good,but the multi-looping paradox time travel makes up for it.The scientist sends his nurse girl friend and his brotherback to before the Asteroid hit Yucatan, where large predatorylizards roamed free. Of 21 sent back only four live to returnand most of the rescue mission are lost as well.A large dinosaur makes it through the time gate / wormholeinto downtown LA. I would have liked this to take place during the day,but since the special effects are minimal,they used the night to hide their faults...and a happy ending results.Let us hope they don't make a sequel."
1,You might regret this waste of time on your death bed,"I picked this up from one of the Red Box rental units at the local grocery store and could tell by the time the credits had finished rolling that this was going to be a real stinker of a movie. B-Movie aside this has wretched acting and a paper thin plot based on highly dubious science. The only plus were the special effects that were so bad that they made me laugh a few times ... seriously folks, do not waste your money."
2,Could have been worse,"The science fiction doubletalk actually wasn't as stupid as many time travel movies, but still pretty bad. The lack of a timer on the return device, especially since the inventor knew ahead of time on would be needed, is an OBVIOUS plot device. The special effects weren't very good, but could have been worse (see AVH: Alien Vs Hunter for the real pits). The SEAL team was stupid and wimpy - maybe even less realistic than time travel. I gave it 2 stars though because it is mildly entertaining."
1,jurassic park meets back to the future,this movie was the worst movie i have ever seen. it should have been called jurassic park meets back to the future. it had a tremors feel to it i think that was due to gross being one of the main characters. the computer anamations were the worst i have ever seen. do your self a big favor and skip this one. i could not be paid to see this one again. it should be a no star movie
4,PRODUCT GETS FIVE STARS ASSEMBLY DIRECTIONS GET NONE,"I RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS BASKETBALL SYSTEM AND I AM GENERALLY VERY HAPPY WITH IT. THE CONSTRUCTION IS SOLID AND APPEARS VERY WELL MADE. AS IT SITS IN MY YARD, IT LOOKS LIKE A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE SYSTEM. THE HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT IS NEAR EFFORTLESS.THE ONLY CRITICISM AND THE REASON THIS SYSTEM DID NOT GET FIVE STARS IS THE LOUSY ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS. THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE UNCLEAR AND INACCURATE IN PARTS. THE HORRIBLE INSTRUCTIONS MAKE ASSEMBLY OF THIS UNIT MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.LOVE THE HOOP/HATE THE INSTRUCTIONS"
1,A Disgrace,"We haven't even gotten this thing together yet and I'm disgusted:1. Many, many missing parts.2. Hardware diagrams are labeled as ""actual size"" while the actual parts specified do not match up with the drawings.3. Customer service center that is closed on weekends, when most people would be attempting to assemble this and might have questions. (Most likely complaints.)Reebok and Lifetime Products clearly do not have any respect for their customers and should be ashamed of themselves. I won't be spending any money with them again. This item is clearly intended for children and will disappoint many of them. I'm glad the other reviewer had a better experience because I wouldn't wish this on anyone."
1,Not Worth The Money,My previous Milwaukee drill worked like a champ for over fifteen years. I wanted to get the same quality so I went with Milwaukee again. The 5380-21 failed after approximately 50 holes in the hammer mode. The chuck stopped turning after less than an hour of use. I finished the job with a Hitachi drill costing less than half of the price. Milwaukee lost their legendary quality when they moved their manufacturing facilities to China. I am so disappointed. I will not buy Milwaukee again.
4,Drilling into hard cement.,The drill works great. I am building a greenhouse on an old washrack next to barn. The slab has been there for twenty-two years! I needed the hammer drill to put the bolts in for the green plate....what a difference! Went from three bits a hole to one for four.
1,the picture you show is not the product I got!!,"I'm really upset because the product all u show in this picture is not what I got, different shape , please try to match the real picture !! How I can get the one I did order and I didn't get???"
4,So far so good,"I just received this and have yet to put it to the test. I did drill a few test holes in concrete (3/8"") and it acted like you were drilling through wood. No strain at all. I will be mixing cement today so time will tell. Seems well built and powerful."
4,Milwaukee hammer drill - pretty good,"Bought this drill to punch through 5"" of concrete to run a pipe. The drill handled it just great, and worked well even in some tight corners. The variable speed is nice and the drill had plenty of torque for everything I did with it. My only complaint is that the anti-vibration mechanism can give your hand a little pinch if you don't have your hand exactly on the grip. No big deal, just wear gloves or keep your hand on the grip. But, after drilling 20+ holes in rapid succession, you tend to want to adjust your grip a bit."
2,Number 2,"I've purchased this drill twice. Both cases the switch has gone out. I assumed the first one was a fluke, but for it to go out on the second one. It's a rarely used tool with a good reputation. What happen? I've got a new switch on order. If it fails, I'm jumping ship from Milwaukee."
1,avoid this one,"I had a similar problem to what another reviewer mentioned: after a few months the shaver completely stopped working. Obviously that's not good. Prior to that, it was an average shaver. Not really any better than my previous one (a Norelco). I didn't like the almost pure alcohol conditioner, so I stopped using that after a short time."
3,Adequate Shaver,"I am fairly happy with the freeglider. I think I have had it for 3 or 4 years. I haven't replaced the blade or foil so I was looking online to do it. The battery doesn't really hold an adequate charge anymore so I just plug it in when I shave. Even without replacing the blade (ever!), it still does an adequate job. I haven't used the lotion in years (it cost too much and Walmart quit carrying it). I have used panasonic and norelco in the past but to be honest, they are all about the same. My beard is not too demanding and they all seem to be adequate. I would like to find a self-cleaning rasor that uses rubbing alcohol to clean. I will probably just end up replacing the blade and foil and using it until it breaks."
3,New Type of Comic Books,"Cry Wolf is a comic book about a detective named Kurt Angelo. Two weeks before his wedding, he is asked on a dangerous journey to find a missing man. So he marries his beloved Rita early and heads to Borneo. On the way he meets Sijan who plans to help Kurt as he continues his journey. However, Kurt's assignment becomes dangerous for both him and his wife. Readers will quickly devour Cry Wolf as they follow Kurt into Borneo. Readers will be fascinated as both Kurt and Rita fall into danger as well as the surprise ending."
4,Old Time Crime Adventure,Cry Wolf reminds me of those old time crime movies you see on Turner Classic Moives. Pictures like White Heat and even King Kong. The detective in the story is bitten by a gaint wolf and he also turns into a gaint wolf. His friend is killed by the same wolf but he changes the curse for the detective so that he doesn't kill the innocent. Only when the innocent are in danger or when there is a need for justice does the detective turn into a giant wolf. His friend has some kind of spiritual powers. I had a lot of fun reading this and I hope there are more stories. The art reminds me of Tarzan or Prince Valiant comic strips from the 1930's and 1940's.
3,solid but not great,"An adventure story that would be at home in any pulp magazine from the 30s or 40s. That's a good thing if you like the pulp formula, but not so good if you like your characterization a little deeper or your setting less cliche. The art is mediocre - it serves the story tolerably well, but it doesn't compare well to the high quality of art seen in many indie graphic novels these days. Recommended only for die-hard completist collectors of werewolf tales and fans of the pulp detective/horror genre."
3,A couple of track are okay,"This soundtrack is very repetitive. It is the kind of CD you buy to temporarily copy to an mp3 player and listen to while you make quick work of general chores (laundry, cooking dinner). Listening yet not listening, just background noise."
4,Voice of a Great Isreali Poet,"Yehuda Amichai, on the one hand an Isreali soldier, and, on the other hand a lyric poet, expressed his own voice in his psalm-like poems. He remained the identity as an Isreali and a patriot too, but he won't hide up his personal voice, expecially his hatred towards war. In some of his poems, we can even hear his innerkmost soliliquy. The translation version of Stephen Mitchell and Chana Bloch is unquestionably the best one, which remains vitality of the original version."
1,This is the worst music that exists.,I'm serious. There is no album that has ever been recorded up to this point that contains music this awful. This is not an exaggeration. It's not even enjoyably bad. Don't think of this as a review. Think of it as a warning. You'd have to be mentally retarded to enjoy this.
1,Who gave these guys a record deal?,"I saw their video for ""WoW, I can get sexual too.""This could very well be the lamest band of all time."
1,Blah,"Wow, this album sucks. Just listen to their lame Supergrass ripoff ""woe"". which sounds like they took the melody of 'Alright' and stuck into a generic emo song"
1,Lovers Knot,"I was very disappointed. This is one of Elenor's earlier books, and at that time they were printed in black and white. I honestly don't recall if that is mentioned when I purchased it. But for me that's a downer, I like to see color."
4,Indespensible,"If you have any interest in pre 1970's sci-fi and fantasy, this is the definitive catalog. Tuck includes some comments on the merits of certain works, but devotes most of his efforts to including primary source citations for just about everything cited, as well as original data if the first source was a periodical. Tuck also includes biographical data and references to works on important authors, and includes lists of stories for compilations. Keep in mind that the complete set is three volumes and is 920 pages. I see that some sellers are only selling two or even one of the volumes. The first two volumes are alphabetical listings of authors. The third volume is titled ""Misc,"" and includes LOTS of important other things, such as pseudonyms, periodical info, international listings of publishers and works, and lots lots more. This is not for the casual science fiction reader, but more for collectors, completists, book sellers, and refrence librarians."
4,Entertaining way to illustrate the implications of actions,"This book made an otherwise boring and long flight fun. The humor is witty. Not only is it entertaining but it gives you a perspective on some of the pressures and tough decisions that executives may have to face. Also, it illustrates the consequences of the decisions after you make them."
1,Why is this guy everywhere?,I get the connection. The same unfunny guy from that VH1 90s show has now written a completely unfunny book. The untalented continue to fall up. I got passed an advanced copy of this shlock. Don't bother.
2,Book 2 Rahab,"I am committed to read all of the books in this series. I started with Ruth then bought the first two. Book #2, Rahab was a little boring to read compared to Tamar and Ruth. I found the beginning a bit repetitive and too dramatic for me. Could not wait to get to the portion where they march and conquer the land and save Rahab and her family."
2,Lineage of Grace 1-5,"Sent these to my mother as one of her 90th birthday gifts. Deliberately got the hardbacks so they would be easier to read--she finds the print not only quite small, but too light for her to even attempt to read. I was sorely disappointed."
4,Unashamed,"Unashamed&#8213;Rahab""A woman with a past to whom God gave a future.""Her father needed money. He wanted prestige and acceptance. Their was one way to achieve it, and Rahab was her father's clear path. He offers her to Jericho's king. But Rahab plans her escape, and finally, she offers the king something he can't resist.The Israelites are marching onward, their sights on Jericho. Many have heard of their God's power and quake in fear of what the Israelites will do when they reach their city. Even with their tall walls, trained army, and military strategy, Jericho is no different.Rahab is curious when she hears of Israel's God, and even more so when something mystifying enters the gates of Jericho. She begins to wonder if a God, who held so much power, could accept a person with scarlet staining her past. And if a nation could receive her for not who she had been, but who she had become."
4,Rahab,"I think this was my least favorite Lineage of Grace book so far. But, I still enjoyed it. I liked seeing things about the Bible story that I wouldn't have thought of, such as Rahab watching the Israelite soldiers from her window, her fear of not being accepted because of her past, and even how she became a prostitute. Lots of personal touches. The ending was especially touching."
4,Rahab,"""Unashamed: Rahab"" is a short story that provides a possible elaboration of the story of Rahab from the Bible book of Joshua. It is historically based and interesting to read. The characters come to life. Even though it is short, it is easy to connect to the characters and become worried with them in the face of danger. The study guide at the back of the book has more questions with obvious answers than provocative ones. It does include some thought-provoking questions as well."
4,Enjoyable Listen,"Celtic Moon reveals that Miller Anderson has a broad range of talent. It shows a different side of the artist. Many songs have a bluesy/folksy sort of flavor that sounds great. There are a couple songs that are worth the price of the CD all by themselves. The last half of the CD really stands out although the very last song doesn't seem to fit in well with the rest of the disc. If you like Miller Anderson, this one belongs in your collection."
2,Scotsman with pants down,"This reminds me of the wind howling up my kilt, the cabers, tossed upon my bog, the oats sown wherever I get the chance."
3,Sheffield Steel,"Eleven tracks of raw rock with enough intensity to melt iron.More complex than North American punk bands like Sum 41 or Blink 182, Hoggboy have delivered a very British sounding CD. The track, don't get lost has a hook like Feeder's Buck Rogers single whilst, call me suck, is based on a blues riff which is reminiscent of Led Zeppelin in their youth but remains an instrumental only. Hoggboy have not fully developed a theme as at times they can also sound a little like the Pixies and Green Day. No bad thing.If you like US Punk and British Rock then this CD should be a rewarding cocktail."
3,Fair compared to his previous CD's,"E-40 is one of those rappers with such a unique style. I liked 40's old CD's much betta, although the new one is cool. If you like 40 check out IN A MAJOR WAY. His old style and lyrics where much phata. Alright then, ya'll stay up......"
2,E-40 GOT NUTHIN,"VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED. E-40 RAPS TOO QUICK, HE IS TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND HE SOUNDS LIKE A TRICK."
1,Button sticks... a big problem,"I purchased this product to be primarily used as a tool for advancing my classroom PowerPoint slideshows. At first, I loved my new freedom to move about the room while giving lectures. After a couple of weeks of gentle use, the advance button started to stick which causes the presentation to advance out of control to the end. I called customer service, and they kindly sent me a replacement. During the first day's use of my new pointer, the button stuck and a slideshow advanced out of control again.I will be looking for a different model. I suggest you do the same."
5,My Son LOVES this!!!,"I bought this months ago I'm hopes to really get these facts in my kindergarten's mind while having fun... It had worked!!! He loves it and knows it!!! We played it almost everyday, I've had to move on to asking the difficult questions of three number equations... He know can fly threw his flash cards and fact sheets and word problems! He is just in kindergarten and is doing GREAT with first grade math (most the time it is to easy)... I'm getting the subtraction bingo just to make it fun like this is. I would recommend this to anyone!!! In fact I have multiple nieces and nephews I'm going to be playing this with and two other sons I will play with I'm a few years..."
3,Thirstystone Coaster Set Whimsical Gecko,"The colors are a bit too harsh, not like the more muted colors in the photo. Also, one broke immediately, so I'm thinking some poor quality."
5,Must Have!,"My Mom recieved this cookbook when she was 22 in 1941 and cooked many, many great meals and unfortunately, many poor ones (not the books fault.) This was the 3rd cookbook from Bloch Publishing. Its first cookbook was the very successful ""Aunt Babette's"" Cook Book, which for many, was considered the modern worlds Jewish Cookbook to judge all others. It was replaced with a more Kosher-observant book written by Florence Kreisler Greenbaum entitled ""The International Jewish Cook Book."" Then in 1941, Bloch replaced it with the more modern, expanded volume, The Jewish Cook Book, written by Mrs. Bellin. It's a ""must have"" in every Jewish home. Never mind the arteries, sometimes you just have to make it the way it was intended to be made. ENJOY!"
2,"Boring, boring!","This book is simply boring. There are fun things to it, especially if you know your Irish history, but these out-of-date parodies are still not good enough to make it worth reading. Under the narrative of Thady Quirk, which is -- at least to me -- fairly hard to get through, we are taken through the history of a protestant landlord family. If you truly dissect the book, there are interesting sides of it, but just as a plain reading, I found it simply boring. It is short and doesn't go into any detailed description of the many events that are told to the reader/listener, it's value were supposedly the mocking of the protestant ruling class of Ireland. Since that value is lost to most contemporary readers, there isn't all that much left."
2,Not fast enough...,"When the cable arrive, the package indicated that it only provides 10.2 Gbps. I was definitely expecting faster performance from the description of the item. Should be adequete for most applications, but I wanted faster."
5,"Great Product, Great Price!!!!!!","I purchased two of these cords, one for my xbox 360 and one for my laptop to hook up to my hdtv. These cables simplify the tangled mess that entertainment centers ultimatly become. Snug fit in my components, and just the right length. I purchased two cables for $40, which is less than the price of one cable at retail! A must have for tech junkies!"
4,It works,"What can you say about a cable? I get a great HD video from the cable box, but don't know how much the cable is responsible."
2,Very short,"While I know the product info say four feet, it really is too small for most applications, may work well with two box sitting on to of each other but not for anything else. Ended up having to get another one that was longer."
1,Monster Ripoff,"First off, HDMI is a digital standard. ANY cable that allows the signal to be turned on and off (think light switch or telegraph) will work. You don't need special gold conductors etc. anymore than the telegraph operators of 1880 did!!Monster made its name decades ago selling better speaker cables to audiophiles willing to pony up big bucks. Even then, tests at very advanced labs showed that cheap lamp cord from the hardware store performed as well for 99.9% of listeners, but Monster prevailed. Good for them I guess as there's one born every minute you know.The bottom line is that a $2 HDMI cable will work just as well as this cable assuming no conductors are broken. Do a search on any AV forum for cheap cables and you will find a web site where you can buy 5-10 HDMI cables for this price and toss out any you feel aren't working for you.is binary. If the signal gets there it works. No fancy cables required EVER."
1,A waste of money.,I will let you know that you are wasting your money on this. I bought a similar cable that supports HDMI 1.2 from eBay for $10 for my other TV and decided to compare cables on my 1080p TV and PS3 with a couble of Blue Ray movies. I have to say that I could not see a single difference in performance. I really regret paying over a $100 for a cable. All I can do is warn others of my mistake.
1,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled by fake reviews and company shills. HDMI is a digital signal and it's all or nothing. All of the ""features"" you see listed are just standard features you would find in ANY HDMI calbe. You can get these cables for a LOT less. Be informed and look around."
1,Not for new TVs,On the package it says this will carry 720p or 1080i signal. If you have a 1080p signal this won't carry full signal.
1,not spend money in this,"a similar cable like 50 cents hdmi doing the same only if you see a monster cable in the store do you buy a electronic the specialist who selling asking you, you supoust to buy because you cant receive a good reception that fair if it not trufh ...dot spend money look in amazon .com you buing for 10 dollars maybe the same monster cable"
2,"Made good use of low budget, but terrible plot","This movie had a lot of great things going for it considering the obvious size of the project. Good use made with effects, some good scares and very tense scenes. And the caliber of the acting for a low-budget horror should give the cast and director something to be proud of (no Academy Awards, but you know...)The serious flaw that made it often unbearable is the plot. Take Nazis, occult, time travel, mind control... then put a plot twist in just about every scene in the film and place every single person under suspicion and you just get a tangled mess. Plot devices in horror films, awesome. But if your movie's flow chart looks a Pollock painting then time to scale back."
2,Not so hot,"I mainly picked this up because I'm a Buffy fan and wanted to see Nicholas Brendon do something besides Xander Harris. Well, you could still see Xander in his character...Anyway, the movie over all wasn't so great. Over all, it was pretty boring."
3,Unholy,"""Unholy"" is a low budget horror/mystery movie, and as such, it's not really any better or worse than most of its type. Its biggest asset is Adrienne Barbeau in the lead part, who again proves that she's a good (Tony Award and Golden Globe nominated) actress and not just a faded sex symbol. The rest of the cast is a mixed bunch and the script rather uneven. It felt like it was trying too hard to be clever with a twist in the end, and failed to really grab your interest on its way there.""Unholy"" is worth renting for fans of low budget horror movies and may be worth buying for Adrienne Barbeau fans. She deserves to be in better movies than this."
1,Unholy not worth it,I saw this movie and thought it was going to be an interesting movie to watch. To me it was boring and confusing. Would not waste my money buying this video.
4,A very impressive debut horror film...,"This brilliantly complex thriller, starring Adrienne Barbeau and Nick Brendon, is a refreshingly smart and taut horror film, providing chills and surprises but never compromising the film's intelligence. Given the chance, I would love to see what the makers of this film could do in the future."
5,Brilliant film!,It takes its time and you must have the patience to allow the mystery unfold. It will take you further than you expect.
3,Not bad for a Prodigy ripoff,"Only gave this one 3 stars because its a ripoff of the Prodigy classic. 5 stars for the original but this fails to do it for me. DJ Mellow-D has proven on many occasions that he can produce good Hard Trance (ex. Phuture Vibes, Mystery In Space, Together, and the current ""@ Night""). He gets a ""B"" for effort because his transformation of hardcore to hard-trance was done well and if this were an original song it would probably a well-rated tune. However, I feel when listening to this that the good memory of ""Out Of Space"" is tainted and something isn't right. His album ""Techno Vibes"" (Hard-trance - not really techno) would be a more worthwhile investment."
5,Aamzing compiation and an amazing mix,"This compilation is one of the few MOS releases of recent times to blow me away. It is an elegant mix of deep house and trance which is seemlessly mixed and the song selection carefully chosen. This will take you on a journey in the same way Northern Exposure somewhat does, I am not saying it is of that level but it is something exciting finally from MOS, especially MOS australia which outside of the endless chillout compilation still somewhat cares.Buy this, download it do whatever to own it, you will be glad you did."
3,It didn't hit it this year.,"This is not the best Annual out, would definitely recommend 06 or 09. This has some of your more popular songs from the year, but it doesn't do those Ministry of Sound people justice."
1,skillet cracks,Placed the skillet on stove and added oil and the skillet cracked and oil went every where.I've cooked with iron skillets for 50 years and never had this to happen also baked with them.The oil made a very big mess to clean because it was all over the stove.After the skillet cooled the crack closed up inside the skillet but on the bottom it was still there.I'm not very pleased with the skillet.
1,Very poor quality - cracked on very first use!,"I cannot recommend this skillet at all. On the very first usage, a crack formed on the side. It seems very cheaply made and I am returning it for a refund."
4,"Bayou Classic 12"" cast skillet","Thank you for a quality product. I am looking foward to having fun cooking with it. This fry pan is heavy and will hold heat, this is what I was looking for,Thanks Dallas B."
4,Happy :),I just recieved the costume today and I am pleased. I was worried about it fitting after reading other people's reviews but it fits well and I am happy with my purchase. I can't wait to wear it to pass out candy on Halloween and to wear it to next years Ren. Fair.
5,Love This Pirate Costume,"I bought this for a pirate party. I love this costume! I am glad, however, that I ordered my size as listed on their sizing chart. Had to order a much larger size than I normally wear. This outfit is made small so make sure to follow their sizing chart. It looks like the picture and is made well."
5,NOT TRUE TO SIZE!!!! Seriously great costume non the less,"I tried this on at a costume shop then found it at a much better price on amazon. I am a size 10-12 Yet I had to buy a 1x-2x plus size in this costume and it is snug in the ribs. Also the sleeves are a very rough lace. You will want to put fabric over the gathered lace/elastic on the upper arm and elbow or it will scratch like crazy. The skirt is thin. The strings to tie it up don't really... look very good. I decided to wear it down. The skirt has more fabric on the bottom than on the top which is what I like. It makes the skirt smooth on the abs, not bunched up with too much fabric. This way it is fitted well on the abs but fuller at the bottom. Very pleased with this costume and paid less than HALF of what I would have at the costume store."
3,Too sterile...,"Leslie Gourse had made a career of collecting informations about jazz musicians - but all the infomations in the world dont neccesary make this book interesting.From time to time it seems to me like Im reading Nat Cole's concert date-to-date schedule,but there were any author's style or opinions to be found.Gourse has obviously spend hours researching the documents about this book,yet there is nothing to be said about MUSIC (except providing chart numbers,again so boring and grey).This book cries to be updated,as Natalie Cole recorded her classic ""Unforgettable"" album after this book was finished!I am currently reading Louis Armstrong's biography ""An extravagant life"" which has everything this book lack: class,style and most of all,the feeling that author was really involved in writting the book,not just collecting recording dates."
2,Not durable,"Silicon became damaged in less than a year, from only moderate use. Otherwise it is a nice size and shape."
2,Oxo Good Grips Large Silicone Flexible Turner,"I'm very disappointed in this turner. It's way too limber for my use. It's also shaped/bent wrong being too straight. I bought it to replace one I had for a number of years,which I thought was made of silicon, but after trying this one one time, I'm ready to throw it away, and keep the old one. Because it was OXO I felt safe ordering it, but I was wrong. They've goofed on this one, in my opinion."
4,Its our second,"The first one came apart at the edge. It was good enough that we decided to get another, but I wish we wouldnt have had the issue."
3,"Love it, but one big problem...","Always had a hard time flipping pancakes (I make 'em big). This turner looked like the right stuff for use on my GE range's nonstick griddle, and it is, size-wise and flexibility-wise. However, the flipper's bevel is reversed so slipping the upside-down flipper under a pancake to check doneness is a cinch, whereas trying to slip it right-side-up under a pancake to flip or remove the pancake is quite problematic. Most of the time it results in a squished pancake.Unfortunately, I didn't used the flipper until more than 30-days after receipt, so I'm going to live with it (though I may call Oxo... their Customer Service has been good to me previously)."
2,Smelly,"It stinks! Literally! The soft silicone used in this comes with heavy chemical plastic-like odors. I don't feel comfortable using something that gives off odors like this. I figure, whatever it is your olfactory receptors are detecting, is going into your food and ultimately down your gullet. Maybe after awhile, the smell will subside, either by use or otherwise, but I'm not going to be using this very often. It's difficult to handle small items (e.g. sausage patties) as it's so large, and slippery when it gets grease on it. However, it makes it easy to do a triple-egg-over-easy! I just wish the thing didn't have such a LOUD odor."
4,"Nice large size, Oxo quality","I'm a big fan of OXO products and have many of them. I was looking for a larger sized spatula for eggs, pancakes and basic cooking. Nylon spatulas are too floppy, the metal ones are too hard on my cookware, wooden implements harbor bacteria, and plastic ones melt.This OXO spatula/turner is perfect! The metal base gives it strength and keeps it from being too floppy, the silicone protects my cookware, and the large size works for everything from pork chops to pancakes. The handle is comfortable in my hand, and there's a hole in the handle in case you want to hang it between uses.I do wish it was just a little stiffer, but it works perfectly the way it is. Another great OXO product that has found a permanent place in my kitchen!"
3,Great! But not very durable.,"I love this spatula and use it practically daily to cook eggs and pancakes. However, after just a few months the tips have cracked and one has broken off, exposing the metal inside. I will probably buy another to replace it, though, because I like it so much."
2,Not durable under steady use!,We have all 3 sizes. The small and medium began to tear after a few months just where the tip tapers. These are metal coated with silicone. The design does not stand up after flexing so many uses and begins to split - exposing the metal inside to your nonstick surface. We loved these and are so disappointed. The largest omelet spatula is still going strong!
2,Not crazy about this.,"This utensil is too big and too rubbery. While I haven't had a problem turning anything, the size and the flexibility of it make you feel like you have little control. I would prefer a sturdier one."
2,Sticky Bugger,"This seems like a really nice kitchen tool on first inspection. But after having used it for a variety of tasks, I wouldn't recommend it. It seems to stick to everything. Eggs are impossible to flip with this as are pancakes. Today I tried to use it to take cookies off a sheet and that didn't work either. Too flexible and the silicone doesn't slide."
2,too floppy,"I'm giving this the same review as I did the omelette turner (I bought both together), because it has the same problem.This thing needs to be stiffer for the size it is. As it is it is TOO bendable and ends up being floppy. I can't use it to cook an omelet or flip a pancake.I have a smaller version OXO Silicone Turner, and that one is great. I was very disappointing in this one that we find almost useless. It will push scrambled eggs around in the pan - but be careful trying to use it to scoop those eggs out of the pan with it."
5,Really is NON-stick!,"LOVE IT! Plastic ones melt, flake, and are hard to clean. This works like a charm, cleaning is a breeze!"
3,Too big,"A little too big.. not so pratical for cooking in general. The small one works just fine to any size of pans. Also, the handle is too short. I can feel the heat from the pan."
2,There are much better titles,"I had recently read ""How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in It"" and since I have a fondness for Scotland and its people I purchased the current volume. The book is very short and the writing is a bit disjointed. While many Scottish Englightenment ideas are addressed in the book, the connection to the American founding fathers is not always direct. In such a short book, that lack of attention to the title is distracting. It is a however a quick read and not completely wihtout merit if you are not looking to devote yourself to a heavy tome."
2,Very quick overview,"There is very little depth or insight in this book. It outlines the important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment and sums up their contributions. I read this after reading Arthur Herman's book on the Scots, so I was disappointed to say the least."
1,Not recommended.,"Ditto what Big Mack Jack said. This book is typical of autobiographies in which the author paints himself as a swell guy who gets shafted by friends & enemies, family, co-workers, cops, lawyers, judges, and life in general."
1,Not a good book.,"Wow, I can't believe the last two reviewers, Pseudo Joe and Big Mack Jack, both echo my sentiments about this book. It's a shame that a publishing company could produce a book glorifying a man who likes to rob and frighten women at banks and loaded with a great deal of ""prisoners are wonderful"" nonsense."
1,"Guaranteed not to be a ""Spotlight Review""",I don't think Joe Loya does a real good job explaining how he made the transition from a bespectacled bookish nerd to a big bad dude in prison. All he did before getting locked up was hold up female tellers and stab his hapless and unarmed dad with a kitchen knife. A guy like that is more likely to be picked on and smacked around by other prisoners than becoming a shot-calling big baller. (And another thing...why does every nickel 'n dime Chicano convict want to write poetry?)
5,Painfully honest story of a stunning turnaround,"We've all read stories of bad-guy-turns-good-in-prison, usually after some religious conversion in jail. While such happy endings feel good, one is rarely completely convinced of an essential change in the character of the convert; if circumstances change, we can easily imagine the person reverting back to his former ways. Not so with Joe Loya. HIs memoir digs so deeply into the dark parts of his soul -- in the least flattering ways possible -- we know instinctively that this is someone who knows himself completely. His redemptive turn in prison is the real thing. Indelible and moving. (And with some great bank robbing stories to boot.)"
2,hmmmmmm.........,"This video had some interesting information on it. (I think the information was a bit dated, though)Here in the U.S. I don't know that we still celebrate Columbus Day. Isn't that rather controversial in the schools today? (Columbus didn't ""discover"" America ~ there were people here before he arrived)Some of the video shots were great. I was looking for MANY interesting facts and a video that would grab my students attention, as we will be studying about Puerto Rico soon.I am also interested in traveling there, but there wasn't a lot of travel information on the video. The video was mainly facts about manufacturing, agriculture, and business.I wouldn't spend $32 on this video."
5,A patriotic soundtrack by one of today's finest composers,"I really liked The Patriot movie; one of the reasons was the music. There are tracks that have a patriotic feel to them and can make you feel a part of the movie.In the opening track there is two themes that are found throughout the entire score. ""Ann and Gabriel is the first time the theme is presented as a whole. ""Preparing for Battle"" is where the other theme is in its entirety, and it is quite a patriotic-like track. There are some sad parts and some epic parts sprinkled throughout the regular type medium and low-paced music.John Williams has produced yet another original soundtrack that is sure to be a favorite in your collection."
5,John Williams has done it again!!!,"This cd is great!!!!!! It really connects you to the movie. If you haven't seen The Patriot, your missing out on a great movie that has great music in it. (along with some really, really hottttt actors!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![Health Ledger for one]) I listen to this cd all of the time and once you get it you will, too."
4,Soul-stirring,"Would recommend to friends solely for the entrancing, heart-rending solo by violinest (er, sorry, 'fiddler') Mike Myers. This Applachian-style melody is equally elusive and unforgettable in its haunted wandering. All the tracks are at least interesting and follow the strong Williams theme well, though its rather intense for casual listening. It is from an action-movie, after all..."
4,"Very good, but not his best","John Williams may be one of the greatest composers of all time. His themes for films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones have been immortalized. No one can hear the music and not know what movie it came from. The soundtrack from The Patriot does not have that same feel to it. This may be due to the fact that The Patriot is not as popular as those films, but a large part of it is due to this soundtrack's lack of emotion at times. Now this does not mean it is a bad soundtrack, quite the contrary, it is very good, and very easy to listen to. It simply does not have the same feel as some of his other works do. What I mean by this is that you cannot listen to the music and picture what is happening the way you can with his other works. This is why I am only giving it four stars. Overall however, if you enjoy classical scores I reccommend this highly as a piece of classical music, but not as a movie soundtrack."
4,Great score,"Surprisingly, I loved this score. Why was I surprised? I'm not the biggest Williams fan. His old stuff was great, but lately he hasn't done too much to talk about. Schindlers List and Jurassic Park were great, but I find it hard to consistantly listen to them. Saving Private Ryan's score was boring overall (probably due to the nature of the film), and only the first two tracks were worthwhile. The Patriot, however, is constantly enjoyable. If you are a Williams fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you aren't, chances are you will enjoy it as well. It's very patriotic, with a solid main theme and several smaller ones surrounding it. Personal favorites are tracks 1)The Patriot and 7)Preparing for Battle. I have listened to it several times through already, and plan to listen to it even more in the future. Grab it."
5,Wow!,"The first track of this CD is absolutely amazing. Mark O'Connor's violin playing is sublime. I'm only sorry that it took me so long to come across this masterpiece by John Williams. Yes, people know about Star Wars and Jurassic Park, but this score is equally moving and triumphant. One of my new favorites!"
2,Williams blows this one,"Well, I don't want to be a wetblanket and ruin all your fun, but seriously, if you actually saw the movie and listened to the music, you would hear how Williams blew this one. He did not write a dramatic score, he tried to put an action or military score into a dramatic movie. He should have taken notes from Horner's ""Glory"" or Hans Zimmer's ""The Thin Red Line"" first. I am not saying that John Williams is a bad composer, he is good for movies like ""Star Wars"", or for the Olympics where upbeat, exciting music is needed, but he can not write a decent dramatic score. Williams should stick to movies like ""Home Alone"" and leave the drama to James Horner. This is a decent soundtrack in itself, but it does not fit with the movie."
2,Back Off,"John Williams utilized brass instruments to a point where it actually hurt my ears in the theaters. There were also moments that were so overglorified by his music that it was funny. Someone tell this character about choirs, strings, and woodwinds. Those instruments can be quite powerfull."
2,weak,Strangely unoriginal for John Williams. It sounds as though another composer is doing their best to mimic him. Very bombastic and stirring at parts but he's done better. Best part - opening guitar and violin solo on title track.
5,Stirring to the last!,"A very moving score, evocative of many of the poignant moments in the movie. The melodic celtic violin passages were haunting. The rousing 'patiotic'themes were equally stirring, much the same as in many of John Williams' other fantastic histroical period scores like Amistad, and Far and Away. A great CD and an absolutely fantastic movie! I reccomend both emphatically!"
5,John Williamas at his finest!,"If you remotely like JW work, you will like this soundtrack. The anthems are moving and patriotic! Buy this now!"
1,One of Williams' worst.,"Man, this score really, really stinks! Given John Williams' pedigree, you would have expected something much better. But now he's on a downward slide. His score in A.I. was even worse."
3,The story of crashed U.S. bombers in WWII England.,"I am going to disagree with the previous reviewers and state this book was only an average read. Why? Because the writing was marginal (with some mistakes) and most of the stories were of bombers crashing in WWII England. The pictures in this book were excellent. The photographer (one of the authors) snapped some great pictures on the death and destruction caused by the crash of these great bombers.The book is good because it shows how even the bomber crews led very hazardous lives in their war with Nazi Germany. One can feel the tension in the lives of these crew members who risked all in their flights over enemy territory. Even over friendly territory, the bombers sometimes fell apart and crashed causing crew and civilian deaths. Indeed these fliers were very brave men.This book has great pictures but only marginal writing. Check it out of the library, and look at the pictures."
4,WORTHWHILE,"Though the technical quality is less than state-of-the-art, both in terms of audio and visual, ""For A While"" and especially ""If You Knew"" are remarkable artifacts of a sometimes petulant, often maddening and always hugely affecting artiste.In my mind the two performances, I singled out are 'five star' -- I've yet to find a more emotional performance of ""If You Knew"" -- cathartic, emotional...PERFECT."
1,PASS ON THIS TERRIBLE DVD!,I'm an avid fan of Nina Simone so I was looking forward to this DVD...But seeing her sweat profusely throughout the show & even complain that's it's way too hot makes this disappointing & disheartening. They should have never released this DVD especially with the artist looking soaked & uncomfortable which is a real travesty. Don't waste your time with this dog! Instead get her best available DVD to date Nina Simone Live At Montreux 1976.
3,undeserving of the movie,i'm bothered by the absence of heroin by velvet underground. it doesn't shine in the same quiet way as the movie.
4,A BOUQUET OF WILDFLOWERS,"While there is much beauty to behold in nature, surely wildflowers are among the most glorious creations. Sturdy, yet often appearing to be exquisitely fragile, they bring palettes of riotous color to our country sides.This posy bedecked spiral bound volume encourages us to collect wildflowers and comment on where and how we found them. It's a wonderful way to introduce youngsters to the bounty of nature.In addition to pages on which to mount the flowers and make notes, there are lovely full-color illustrations of the different varieties of wildflowers, suggestions as to how to press them, and directions for making flower postcards, stationery, and perfume.- Gail Cooke"
2,Veronica,"Disappointed at the misleading title of ""collectible"". This was advertised as a first edition when in reality it is a first edition of the 1991 print which is by no means a COLLECTIBLE. Although the book is in great condition it was supposed to be a gift for someone and I am very disappointed that it is a book that I could have just purchased at a book store locally."
2,Poor quality; provides limited protection,I bought these for my dog and they immediately bleed through to the underlying surface. Provide limited protection since it is a single layer.
3,Used as wee wee pads for dog,"I buy the underpads specifically for my dog as wee wee pads. They tend to be cheaper than those pads made with a special scent to attract dogs. This specific brand isn't as absorbant and the liquid spreads a bit more than the brand I used to buy at Rite Aid (can't remember the brand now). But ultimately, these do the trick."
2,Blue Disposable Underpads,Fuzz flies all over when opening them. They are not like the others I have ordered .Have to order a different brand next time
5,good size and does the job,The pads are as advertized. It does the job and comes at a very good price. Happy with the purchase. There is no packaging or branding that comes with it which makes you feel little confused about the product but then in the end it really does not matter.
5,New Parents Must Have,"These are a great item for use when changing diapers. We bought some after our first child was born, as the hospital used them quite a bit when we were there. We decided to buy our own, and have been very pleased with that decision. No diaper bag should be without them."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for hospital quality underpads. Something that would draw in moisture when changing the baby. It does great keeping what underneath dry, but the top stays wet. They're very thin and low quality. Not what I expected."
1,Rip off - advertise as Chux pads and sell Dynarex pads,I ordered Dynarex pads separately and they were cheaper. I ordered this simultaneously thinking that this would be similar to the ones we use in my workplace which I know are thick and absorbent but they sent Dynarex pads! When I asked for a refund I was told I would have pay for shipping to send it so I have kept it. What a rip-off!
1,Not as advertised!,"This is not the product I shopped for. I have been using the brand for several years now and when I saw the price it was too good to be true. You know what they say : and it usually is.There are too soft no padding at all, you get what you paid for, stay away."
2,doesn't absorbe!,a very poor absorbent practically none! i was using the hospitals ones which are incredible thicker and more absorbent then this ones.
4,"not as same as hospital grade, but still worth buying","it is thinner compare to the hospital ones, but you can't beat the price.however if you are looking for something more absorbant, dont get this one, find the Champagne (I think this is how it spells but you can look it up in Amazon)overall a good product"
3,Not as nice as Huggies brand,"This pad is technically a little larger than the Huggies brand and it is softer, but the fold is larger and the pad itself is not as sturdy. This is certainly cheaper than Huggies, which is why I tried it. I like the Huggies one better because it folds into a smaller size, which makes it easy to store or bring along in a diaper bag and I like the substantial weight that makes it harder for the baby to kick and mess up. Absorbency between the two is about the same."
1,Different from what is shown in the picture,"As other reviewers said these are of poor quality and different from what is shown in the picture. I've ordered the ones that are in the picture before in smaller pack and quality was pretty good for the price, but these ones don't have cotton cushion and just useless - I would hate to put my baby on them."
4,Good to put under you and baby when breastfeeding,"I have a couple of these on my bed to put under us when we wake up for midnight breastfeeding. I already have a pad on my bed, but these are a precaution, and also I don't need to wash the mattress topper every time. If these get wet, I just put these on top of our changing pad to reuse until they get completely unusable.50 lasted me through one baby with some leftover. So this pack of 100 will last me through one baby, and with tons leftover.I leave some in each stroller, in the car, in every room, etc.They're not for heavy duty usage, but a precautionary usage, for us at least.Great price, I like this product.Downside is I wouldn't depend on these to soak up urine or runny poop, they still leave a wet spot underneath. The moment you see first sign of urine or poop, move baby!"
3,Only Moderate Absorption,"I buy these pads as corner protection for my little balls of ferret wonder. They poop about a tablespoon out every 3 hours (times 2 fuzzits), so the pads need to absorb a nontrivial amount of...stuff. Compared to puppy training pads specifically intended for animals, they don't absorb very well and tend to spread the urine out rather than absorbing it. They're also a bit thin for the purpose. Nonetheless, it's a great bargain."
2,ok,not bad but i thought that they were very thin. they held up to my baby urinating on them ok. still could have bee a little thicker
5,Awesome for doggy pee pads!,"I have housebroken 3, 6-week old chihuahuas using these pads! They are thin, but I do not need anything thicker to absorb their little messes. These are so inexpensive compared to any type of underpad you can buy at the store and work just as well. Great product for doggy pads and housebreaking. I would recommend these to anyone for dogs that wants to stop spending a ridiculous amount of money on the special ""sent releasing"" dog pads."
2,flimsy,"At first I bought Chux from Samela Inc and was so happy with them. Unfortunately, they were not available from that seller and I had to look for another one. Got it from Direct Care Store. What a huge disappointment! I naively believed that all blue underpads are the same. I could not be more wrong. The pads that Direct Care Store sells are correct size, but the are so flimsy my 3-month old baby tears them with a couple of moves. Also they are not absorbent enough - even a little spill just stays as a pool.I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Leaky leaky leaky!!!,"There really is no value to having these as a safeguard for diaper changing, puppy pads, or any other use I can think of. Basically all they do is give you a false sense of security, until you remove the first one and realize everything beneath it is soaked!!"
1,noooo,"I gave this 1 start because these ""pads"" are better than nothing......but not by much. It is very thin. The absorbant layer is not uniform. One spot it's okay, but in the next spot there is nothing. I accidentally ordered these. Man what an expensive goof. I hate them."
5,GREAT!,"I just recently purchased this book and it was one that was difficult to put down. While there were a few bits that I didn't find too terribly funny, the vast majority of them were very funny. Some of his bits were even laugh out loud hysterical. This book is grouped up into what the different stand-up routines are about, which I liked because it was well organized and jokes weren't just thrown around randomly. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who's a fan of the comedian and the character Jerry Seinfeld."
2,WHAAAAT is the DEEEEEAL with this BOOOOOOK? It's a book about NOTHIIIING!,"Found a used copy of this, many years after the fact, and thought I'd give it a try. I've never been a fan of Seinfeld the comedian or ""Seinfeld"" the sitcom, although I've at least started to grudgingly admit that he can be funny sometimes...maybe by accident.The few laughs I got from this book seemed to be accidental, anyway..but there were still enough to rate two stars...just barely!As Seinfeld might have observed, 'It's like the jokes were invited to a party for all the other funny jokes, but the not-funny jokes crashed the party. You could almost imagine a guy at the door saying, 'OK, one-liners over there, riddles, this way, shaggy-dog stories, yeah, come on in, you're good...vaguely humorous observations? I don't see you on my list...''Classic example of a guy who already had more than enough money trying to cash in even more."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny","This book just reminds me that Jerry Seinfield is a funny, funny man. It is a lighthearted bunch of ""nothng"" that makes you laugh form the begginning to the end. I don not wish to say more because the book says it all. I loved this book."
1,El Stinko,"This Seinfeld book really stinks. Some parts were funny and Seinfeld is indeed a funny guy, but this book was just El Stinko. He is much better as a stand-up. This book is just small bits of comedy and it is just too irritating to follow. You try to imagine his voice, but it just doesn't come across. I get the feeling he didn't type one word of this book. If he did, it would come across better."
2,close to being a rip-off,"If you're enough a fan of Seinfeld to be looking at this, you're not gonna get something you haven't seen before.This book is nothing more than the transcripts of virtually all the stand-up segments from the Seinfeld show, so you've probably heard all the jokes. There's no new material. It seems like somebody just got some production assistant somewhere to transcribe all the stand-up stuff and then sent it off to the printers as a way of churning out even more money for Seinfeld & Co.If that isn't bad enough, Seinfeld seems a lot more witty and insightful in person than in print. When his jokes are written down, they seem crude and whiny."
2,Is this book for Die-hard Seinfeld fans?,"Jerry Seinfeld is a stand-up comedian.And his ever famous Sitcom-'Seinfeld' is worth a million laughs,with George Costanza,Elaine Marie Benes and Cosmo Kramer. But his shows are to be ""watched"" and not read.This book is a collation/collection of most of his classic one-liners - but all you're left with imagining the real episode on dvd,when you read though any of it from the book.I've even watched that DVD-Jerry seinfeld: Live on Broadway? Well,Jerry Seinfeld must be one of the masterminds of the show and the script, but he can't pull it off without the remaining 3some."
5,A good laugh for us cynics,"A good one, but a short one. Good book for the beach or a short plane flight; or if your like me, a good book for inspiration on just how dumb us humans really are."
4,Humor to go ...,"I really enjoyed this book. I was a big fan of the show and much of what you will read in the book is from actual show material. Whether or not you think it's humorous is a matter of personal taste. If you are into sarcasm and wry humor then you will probably like it. Jerry says upfront that it's all in the delivery, inflection, yadda yadda and he's right. If you can hear it in your head then believe me it's funny. Every now and then I pull this book off of the shelf and re-read it just because it still puts a smile on my face when I'm down."
1,very disappointing,"Loved the show. Hate the book. I bought this to read on the plane during a recent trip because it had short passages that could be read seperately and still be enjoyed.However, I didn't find most of them funny, even when I imagined him on stage telling them. I don't recommend this book but suggest the DVD's of the show instead."
4,fun book,it is a good sample of his standup type comedy and provides some good laughsthe book can brighten up a dull day
5,"If you've seen the shows, you've heard it all before...","...but that doesn't make it any less hilarious or TRUE! These are Jerry Seinfeld's observations about life including things both big and small. His views are extremely funny such as on homophobia: ""guys are a little afraid of homosexuals because they know that if they by accident went into a gay store that they could be talked into anything."" Most of the observations will serve as repeated information for anyone who has seen every episode of Seinfeld. Many of the quips in this book turned into the monologues in the beginning of each Seinfeld episode. Nevertheless, this is a quick and fun read that will never be outdated because of it's extremely funny subject matter. JERRY, PLEASE RELEASE THE SHOWS ON DVD BY SEASON!! Recommended."
2,There's a reason this book sells for a penny...,"This book was hugely disappointing. I'm a huge Seinfeld fan - my Tivo is always jammed with episodes and I'm anxiously waiting for the DVD release. I thought the DVD ""Comedian"" was pretty entertaining, but I simply could not get into this book and read 1/3 before putting it down for good.If you're like me and assume this is any sort of story you'll be disappointed, too. The book is nothing more but a series of jokes, each a paragraph long or so, that do not make up much of a larger story. If you're familiar with the show, you'll have already heard most of the jokes as intro's to the show.My suggestions- if you're looking for Seinfeld material, the ""Comedian"" DVD is good or be patient and wait for the episode series to come out. If you're looking for a comedian's book to read, Drew Carey's is a bit older, but pretty funny nonetheless.There's a reason why ""Seinlanguage"" sells for $0.01."
4,funny observations,"What can I say? If you like Seinfeld, you'll like this book. His observations are witty and point out the absurdities in our culture. True, a lot of this material has been done on his show. But if you're like me and don't get a chance to catch it in syndication, most of this is a pleasure revisited.Other recently enjoyed books - NO ONE'S EVEN BLEEDING and DELANO"
4,A Sein of Our Times,"""NO SOUP FOR YOU!""""Ya-da ya-da ya-da""""Poppy was a little sloppy""""If we pick do we not bleed!""""Thank God I took off my heels and put on my himalayan walking shoes!""Who could forget the hysterical comedy of a show so simple it becomes complex. The man behind it all does not disappoint us with this culmination of all things extraordinarily ordinary.A great book not only for the Seinfield Fan, but for the fan of stand-up in general. It only takes a few pages to get hooked into the writing.Although I do agree that stand-up is meant to be performed, it doesn't take much for your imagination to bring it to life.I definitely recommend Seinlanguage."
2,Get the DVD,I am a Seinfeld fan but I do not find the jokes in the book funny. And you know why? Because what makes it really funny is the delivery! I rent out the DVD of his Broadway farewell performance and he was delivering the same jokes in the book and they were insanely hysterical! Stand-up is meant to be heard not read.
2,Occasionally funny but fairly thin,"This book is a collection of Seinfeld's brand of humour, arranged in paragraphs and, to an extent, topics. There is a problem with such a format. If you're a great fan of Seinfeld, chances are, you'll know most of the material in the book (a big part of it is the same as some of Seinfeld's comedy bits in the TV show). If you're not a fan, then I think that it's best to see most comedians live, and if a book is some attempt at a reproduction of their act, it's not nearly as funny.From my experience, the best comedy books take advantage of the book form to provide lots of content that's different to a live act (for instance humour involving/incorporating images). For a purely verbal, observational style, nothing beats personal presence.For maximum hilarity, watch Seinfeld in his show or in his act, or read a more involved comedy book. This one, while it has its moments, has neither aspects of the two."
4,Seinfeld is the best at making the everyday funny,"Some people have stated that the long-running Seinfeld sitcom was a show about nothing. Which is probably true, but largely irrelevant. A large amount of very good comedy is based on the incongruity of everyday events, which to some people is nothing. Seinfeld continues in this mode with the short vignettes in this book.The stories vary from the problems of finding a parking spot in New York City to the absurdity of professional wrestling. Each is funny and demonstrates Seinfeld at his comedic best. He is the best at taking the everyday things of life and making them funny. I urge you to read and enjoy."
4,Funy stuff,"This is one of those I always meant to read but just never got around to.Most of the stuff in here you already saw on the TV show, but since I loved the show, it didnt hurt my feelings any.Funny stuff and even more so if you read it and pictured him saying it."
3,Not too bad!,"I absolutely love the 'Seinfeld' series, and when I found this book at a local thrift store for under $5, I totally had to snag it! The book is quite funny, but after seeing practically every episode of 'Seinfeld' at least two or three times, many of the jokes in the book that relate to this, seemed a little redundant. Of course though, bear in mind that this book was probably published at least 15 years ago, and of course too, the 'Seinfeld' series ended almost 12 years ago, so that makes sense to see a lot of the jokes and what not used in the series. Great book, and truly an interesting, comedic read! I saw Jerry back in Denver a few years ago, and it was truly awesome! Buy this book if you want to laugh and learn!"
3,Interesting for a while,The book was interesting for a while but my little tyke seemed to lose interst in it after a few days.The book captured the attention of the child for a few days though.
4,"Great, but kind of a duplicate","We had his other ""Look Look"" so got this to read to our baby. This book is kind of repetitive to Look Look, but is also entertaining. You won't go wrong with getting this for baby, especially if you love to read to baby."
5,Our twins' favorite for months and months!,"We first showed this book to our twins when they were about 3 months old and they loved staring at the black and white pictures. They continue to love it to this day (at 9 1/2 mo. old). They also love other books by the same author. It works to get their attention, curb fussiness, etc. almost every time."
4,Disguyz-Believe In Us-Yes Show,"If you get the chance to go see this group perform live, then by all means go. They perform nightly at the Polynesian Palace in Waikiki. Its called the Yes! International Revue Show. They are great. I saw them recently and I bought their cd after the show. They even autographed it. I like the song called ""unselfish love"". The cd is very good and their show cd, which is also available after the show is also good."
4,Family Saga Kept Me Connected,"The Man from ShenandoahMs. Ward made me feel comfortable within her first 'Owen Family Saga' novel. Perhaps living in the SW as she has for years she learned a certain amount by osmosis, but, my having been around horses and in the country she writes so well about made me feel connected to the setting. The Civil War history provided insight not always read about. A moving novel.Jane Cheek - Co-author of Dance on the Wild Side"
5,great,greta for energy focus ..some digesting ..calming down your stomach if mixxing too much food..all around player of the game
4,such a soulful crooner,"great disc, even if it is just demos. a different glenn here, collaborating with geoff downes. mellow and funky in spots.overall a great cd"
1,This should come with some ky jelly,"This is only Glenn, a drummer, and a synthesiser- that's it. Someone said something about this being low budget- give me a break- surely they could afford SOMEBODY to play a guitar. I like Glenn a lot, but I listened to this one time and that's all I'll ever listen to it.I don't know what he was thinking."
1,08 Chicory Chick,I've been ripped off. I purchased Chicory Chick and it plays Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Who do I contact to get the song I thought I ordered?
3,"Repetitive, does not include men singing Hebrew funeral rites","repetitive in songs, famous woman singer, does not include the group of men singing funeral rites."
2,wrong dimensions,Be warned when you buy this that the length is not 2 yards as advertised. It is only 1.5 yards!
5,wedding dress,I bought this horsehair braid not knowing exactly what I needed it for but it soon became evident. It made the hem of the wedding dress I made for my daughter hang just right. I'm glad I followed the pattern.
2,Bostitch Nails,The nails where delivered in a timely mannner but the packaging was totally destroyed and overpacked with another box. Most of the nail strips where damaged and un-usable.Overall not very happy and would not purchase agian or recommend anyone else purchase this item.
5,"Great for parents, too","You know how kids like to hear the same things over and over and over again? My husband and I enjoy listening to this CD as much as our one-year-old. The musical style of each piece is different, and these are *real* songs. Clever, sweet lyrics and catchy tunes make for an all-around enjoyable album.Update--two and a half years later, we're still loving this, as is our child. Not tired of it. All the other Tom Chapin albums are as charming.2003: Here's another update! Four and a half years later, we continue to play this album over and over, and we all still love them. A couple of the songs are bedtime standards, and we're starting to play them for the second child."
5,Tom Chapin: In my hometown,"An awesome CD! Great for kids and the whole family to play in a car on trips (for example). Also great for ESL teachers when introducing the U.S. culture to foreigners/newcomers. I highly recomend this CD to the U.S. State Department, Military, and overseas contracting families - a great taste of the States! A nice and a thoughtful gift to those serving our country around the world - far away from their hometowns :-)"
5,Great for a variety of ages,"My boys are 5 and 9, and like many, are exposed to a lot of pop music via TV. YUCK. I love this CD because it is geared to children who are still children, not mini adults. I also love it because the songs are so ""singable""! After only a couple of times listening to the tape in the car we were starting to catch on to the tunes and sing along. Having music we can all enjoy while en route is very nice. I will say that my 9-year-old enjoys the lyrics more than my younger son, but he'll soon grow into the songs. We LOVE ""Harry the Hat"" -- ""Da Baby Sitter..."
5,A Must Buy for the Whole Family,"After checking out this CD from the library, we listened to it every day until it had to be returned. The songs are fun for all ages, with some good overall messages built in.I can't wait to hear his other albums."
5,My favorite Tom Chapin album... highly recommended,"Our first Tom Chapin album, ""Billy the Squid,"" was borrowed from the library. I found the lyrics so clever, and the tunes so catchy, I ended up tracking down all of his albums available in the library catalog, then proceeded to buy all my favorites. ""In My Hometown"" is at the top of that list. The tunes are all pretty snappy, and I would be hard-pressed to choose my favorite... although I *love* ""A Mozart Duet,"" which actually incorporates the Sonata in C. It *exactly* captures the way a kid tends to practice the piano and addresses the problem. Not to mention that my 4-year old is now *so* familiar with the piece in question she actually recognized it (Mozart, not Tom Chapin) when she heard it on the radio! She also spontaneously sings several the songs on her own... without the CD! The very best part is that it's ""real"" music... not the dumbed-down, sacharine pap that usually passes for kids' music."
4,Decent fridge lock,"Even though I've broken two of these now, I still like this fridge lock. The latch is very solid, and clicks together nice and tight. It is very good at keeping little children out of your refrigerator. It has a button you can use to keep it in the unlock state, which I highly recommend you do when you have guests over. Both of my latches I've bought so far have been broken by guests who did not know there was a latch."
2,borken already,i put it on like the instructions said and its broken after being on my fridge for one day was kinda a waist of money now i have to find a new kind to keep my 2 year old out of the fridge.
3,Worked good at first but broke too easily.,"I really liked this lock, I bought it to keep my dog out of the fridge, and it worked perfectly for that and for keeping my two year old out. The problem is my four year old jerked on the door and the lock broke.So, If it's for a toddler this will work well for you, but older kids can and probably will break it."
1,Lame,This product worked great for 48 hours. Then the latch stopped closing. I tried repeatedly to get it working again to no avail. Difficult to remove from your fridge after.
1,Don't buy this,"It broke on the second day. Either wait it out and just watch to be sure your kid doesn't open the fridge for a while, or find a better lock...this is a piece of junk. I want my money back!"
1,Our not-quite-2-year-old broke this all by herself,"We bought this from a store and were pretty happy with it. It seemed to work great, until we noticed the blue piece of plastic that holds the latch in place had snapped off. We assumed that an adult had tried to open our fridge not realizing the latch was there and pulled too hard and snapped it off, so we went to amazon and bought another one. The second latch lasted only a day, and this time we were certain no adult had broken it. Our 20-month-old simply pulled on the fridge door until it broke open. Do not buy."
1,Non-Functional,"I should have listened to the poor ratings this product received. I purchased this product to keep my two year old out of our refrigerator. I patiently waited 24 hours after installing the lock to allow the adhesive to dry but to no avail. Within a few hours of using the lock, my daughter pulled the refrigerator door hard enough so that the entire lock became disconnected from the refrigerator."
4,Not for Children Over 2 Years Old!,"This works fine for smaller children, but by the time my son reached 2 years old he was pulling the lock OFF the fridge! He knew how to take it apart so now I am looking for something BETTER. I saw that Safety 1st has some magnetic locks, but I have not tried them yet."
4,1 and 2 year old,"I have both and one and two year old who are both always trying to see what the latest goodies are in the fridge. This is the first Fridge latch that I tried and have had it for about 6 months now with no problems! As long as you follow the instructions on allowing the glue to dry well, there shouldn't be a problem. We move this weekend and I am online right now to buy another one. It has saved me a huge headache. It can also be disengaged for normal use."
2,"Worked okay, but didn't last","We bought this in mid-February after my daughter flooded our kitchen (she rearranged our refrigerator and shut the door in a way that pressed an item onto the water dispenser that's inside and left the room). It was easy to install and it kept the children from being able to open the refrigerator door. I also liked that we could disable the lock when the children were sleeping. It's early April now, and the lock is worthless at this point. The plastic has too much give and bends and the lock no longer works at all. I've chosen a different lock to try and hope it lasts longer."
1,Save your $$$$$...,Is there anything less than one star? I guess a one star rating is the lowest I can go. Absolutely a piece of junk. How can a piece of tape hold a refrig door securely? A chair leaning against the refrig door would do better!
3,Buy several for backups. Breakage is guaranteed.,"Works great! But when your gorilla friends and neighbors come over for the cookout and their brows furrow and jaws jut and they give a mighty yank when the fridge door doesn't open at first pull because you (of course) forgot to disarm the latch .........So buy extra, that little plastic lip will - I repeat - will - break off.Oh, and if the glue fails it is because you didn't wash the normal kitchen grease and grime off with soap and warm water and then wipe the area down with alcohol to ensure compete dryness. Properly installed the glue will not fail before the device breaks."
1,Broke within 3 hrs!!!,"Do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS!! This product broke within the first day of us having it from my 18 month old still trying to open the refrigerator. You can't return it and they won't refund your money for it, so save yourself some time and look elsewhere!!"
2,Not sticky enough,"This worked great for a few weeks, but the sticky stuff has started to give way. It's fine for our purpose because we only use it because the freezer door won't stay shut all the time, but if you are using this as a child protection device, I suggest something that won't give way."
4,Works well,Works well as a deterent for our 1.5 yr old on our single door fridge. Only problem is that it is nearly invisible so if you have a guest you need to warn them the fridge is locked
3,"Good idea, but the adhesive needs work","This is a great idea, but after being on my fridge for about 6 weeks, the adhesive let go of the lock itself. So now, I have a big glob of adhesive still stuck to my fridge that does not lock.Toddler has not figured out it doesn't work anymore though, so maybe I can find another solution before he does."
1,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I bought this product to help us assure that we properly close the door of our freezer that we keep in our garage. It worked very well for a couple of days and then, it broke. So I installed the second of the two locks that I ordered. The second lock didn't even last for a day as the latch doesn't work. This lock is a great idea, easy to install and comes with clear instructions. Unfortunately, it fails to do its job, rendering it useless."
2,Did not hold,I purchased this and the first day it seemed to hold well but after a few attempts of opening the fridge without using the release and it came right off. This was not strong enough for our needs.
2,"Bought two, both broke","This worked for a few days and then when someone wasn't careful, the locking mechanism broke. So I bought another one, thinking it was just one of my older kids fooling around. The same thing happened with the second lock. This product is not durable."
3,Be careful when opening and closing...,"The piece that latches on to lock is made of cheap plastic that cracked and split off from closing the freezer door. You have to ""open"" the fridge latch and then close the latch to lock it properly (as opposed to simply opening and shutting the fridge or freezer door). Otherwise, it works great. I have it on my trash can to keep my toddlers from opening it. Make sure you clean the surface before applying too with alcohol for proper adhesion."
1,Simply does not work,"The adjustable feature sounds good, but continually pops off. I have purchased these from Target several times and the last time decided never to buy again."
1,Junk,"This thing is very convenient to open with one hand. It is so convenient that my 2 1/2 years old just looked once how we do it, and opened it himself right away (ok, he had to use two hands). Yet, that wasn't a big deal, as the latch fell off on its own 3 days latter anyway.Junk."
2,If you never need to open your refrigerator again,"This not only blocks babies from opening the fridge but adults, too. Way to stiff to open and requires two hands. A good way to diet, perhaps, if you can never actually open your refrigerator. I got the Fridge-Guard instead. Works perfectly."
1,horrible!,This did not work one pull from an adult that did not realize it was there it was done. It can stand up to a child stredth but it ruined from my husbad pulling it apart because he kept forgetting
2,To simple,I put this on and five seconds later my two year old opened the fridge. It is was to simple of a lock. I am sure a monkey could figure it out in two seconds...However it was very easy to put together and put on and it was shipped promply.
1,Fridge Lock,This did not work even one time to keep our 2 1/2 year old out of our side-by-side fridge. It popped right off. I wish it had worked. We even waited the full 24 hours for the glue/tape to dry.
1,does not work,i bought this latch because i have a dog who loves to go threw the fridge and have a feast i got 4 of the latches and it did not work at all .... he popped then off within two seconds i even put crazy glue thinking maybe it would stick better the second time but i was so wrong he ripped them off without even trying do not get this product. such a waist of money....
1,Very disappointed,"It broke after two days of normal use. First it would keep locking in the unlatch position, then the entire latch broke off. It stuck to the fridge without a problem though. I would not recommend this product."
2,Skip it,"The first 50 or so pages of this book are barely useful and you can read them in 15 minutes or so. The remainder offers advice like ""Dress warmly but in layers . . ."" (page 96). It's also dated,--recommending a high carb, modest protein diet (page 74) when most modern programs recommend more protein. In all, it's just not very good."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"These spades are used on my Monster cables. They work as advertised. I just think they are over-priced. In hindsight, I would have preferred these were already on the cables. I doubt I will ever change the connectors."
1,wrong format,I guess I ordered the wrong format. My DVD doesn't play it.I am in S. Africa. All other DVDs I have received via Amazonwork fine.
4,una obra maestra,"Neruda ha escrito en el ambito de la autobiografia, una obra maestra. Franca, aveces muy divertida pero tambien triste como es la vida. Su dominio de la palabra y prosa es indiscutible. No todos van a estar de acuerdo con sus observaciones politicas pero lo que sobresale es su mezcla de prosa con poesia. Es una obra de arte."
1,Blasphemous,"I searched through my parents' old records and found this beauty. When I looked at the tracklisting and saw 50 songs or so crammed onto one record, I began to cringe. After popping this sucker onto my record player, a horrible techno-ish drum beat began and I proceeded to cry and vomit. Well, maybe not but it's pretty bad. If you want to waste your time listening to garbage, I highly recommend this! It sounds like a 12 year old bought a $10 sound editing program for his computer and cut and pasted the marvelous works of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, etc. onto a phatty drum beat that he made in 5 seconds."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product, based on the shipping weight of almost 1lb and the demensions of 8x2x9 i was expecting a doodle board to come with it instead of just a cd rom. If your looking for a doodle board this is not the ad for you."
3,"Good enough book, but a little dated","This book is sweet and charming, but clearly reflects the time it was written (1922). The two heroines, Rose Elinor and Mary Lou, are brave and adventurous, and get to meet Thomas Jefferson and General Lafayette, but sometimes the writing is a little precious concerning Rose Elinor's maturation into a ""proper little maid of Virginia."" And the way that Curtis depicts the black slaves, particularly the old style of rendering dialect, and the general assumption that the slaves are simple-minded, is both distracting and offensive to modern eyes. However, young children may not notice that (it's not a major part of the book), and Mary Lou is an especially appealing heroine."
1,Disappointing Cantonese Book,Received book which had quite a lot of ink notes. Pencil I could erase but it was ink.So disappointing was receiving cassette tapes. Who uses a cassette in this day and age.The package is useless to me as I don't have a cassette tape and haven't used them in a zillion years.Sellers need to emphasize more when using tapes instead of DVDs
5,Don't buy other than Sony,"Previously I've buyed Sandisk Memory Stick pro and within the first month of use the memory fails with the typical error stated by other users (look rating for sandisk memory stick). With this one I have no problems, its fast, reliable and today there is no big difference in costs. Don't use other than this!!!"
4,Informative and entertaining for both adults and children,This video is great for any child that goes nuts when the garbage man comes to his/her house every week. Gus the garbage man in the video takes a boy and his dad to work with him for a day. He shows many examples of different trucks and where the trash is emptied from the truck. It also discusses recycling.
4,All Reference but Invaluable for the Researcher,"Shelby Stanton's book ""Vietnam: Order of Battle"" is a recent re-issue of a classic reference text that is essential for anyone who is researching America's long, troubled war in Southeast Asia. The book does not have a narrative, or an overview of the war, it is simply a well-researched and comrehensive breakdown of facts, the engagements that the United States and its allies fought, the organization and insignia of the units that serves in Vietnam, the fixed wing aircraft, the ubiquitous helicopters, small arms, heavy weapons, armor that were used, the deployments and casualties, military terms and finally, a very useful series of maps of the conflict. Shelby Stanton is an authority on the War in Vietnam and has authored many books on the subject and this large coffee-table volume is the product of an unusually dedicated and indefatigable researcher."
2,Photo Quality,The poor quality of the photographs as compared to the original Order of Battle is the factor that makes me question my purchase. It seems as if a no attention was paid to reprinting clear pictures.
2,Poor quality materials,Very poor quality materials. Unfortunately the market is overwhelmed with Chinese-made crap that lacks quality and craftsmanship. Ok for a small child who won't notice the poor quality.
4,Great Bonus Tracks!,"If you have heard the song ""Eighty Days"" it is probably because you already own the album ""This Strange Engine"". But the real treat on this CD single are the great bonus tracks. Included here are unreleased live versions of two songs. They include a 16 minute version of the song ""This Strange Engine"" which, as of this writing, have not been on any of the official live Marillion albums. And also the fan favorite ""Bell in the Sea"". This song was originally recorded during the ""Seasons End"" era of the band when new singer Steve Hogarth had joined the band. The song never made to that album but has been a long requested song for the band. This live version clocks in at 4 minutes and 23 seconds. Marillion has often put many great live or unreleased songs on their singles. This single is a great example of why many Marillion fans will buy all the singles they can get there hands on."
3,Not that great...,"These aren't all that bad, but I probably won't be ordering them again. The blueberry flavor is a bit strong compared to other blueberry-flavored coffees I have had, and the coffee itself is definitely a low grade blend...."
5,A great Cd,I think this is a great song! Everybody should get this cd! There are so many wonderful groups that recorded this song!
5,I love this song!!!! Nick RULES!!!!!!!,this is a amazing song. The best part in it is when you hear nick's voice. It's true that the music does heal your soul. Especially when that music involves Nick C. But why did N Sync have to be a part of it.We all know that they shouldnt be mixed with bsb N Sync almost ruined the song for me. Nick if you read this i just want you to know I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!
5,I love this CD!,"I heard a clip of this, and literally got in the car and bought it. This is GREAT! It has 4 songs, the radio version, Instrumental, Classic (the orchestra), and the Unplugged (no drum beat). This has the Moffats, Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, Sarah Brightman, Touche, Squeezer, Mr. President, and many more. This is a great CD! I'd recommend it to anyone...j"
5,GREAT,"I love how they all came together and done this great song. I listen to it when i am feeling really bad and sad and the song lifts me right up! I especially love listening to The Moffatts cd The song titled "" i'll be there for you"" I LOVE IT!!!"
2,I don't know... I need to ask a question,"I can't REVIEW this, 'cuz I've never heard it. But I need to ask a question, so I could buy it, then REVIEW it...Is Sarah Brightman on this? I heard that she was, but please let me know so I can confirm this. Email me or post, or whatever..Jeff"
1,Let The Music Heal Aaron Carters voice,"I listen to a lot of pop/rock music. I heard this song ""Let The Music Heal Your Soul"" around the holiday time. I did not like the song. Aaron Carter whines in it. Did you hear his voice? He is singing out of his nose. Bakcstreet Boys rule and 'N Sync rule too, but only when they are two separite groups. All together with Aaron Carter is just bad news."
1,"Hey Ya'll, Wazz Up Wazz Up",I wouldn't know what to say about this cause I haven't listened to it. Sorry. Write me if you want at Hotty9111@yahoo.com. See Ya'll.
5,This is a Great Boat!!!,"I absolutly love this boat! I bought one about 3 days ago at a ""Toys R Us"" store and I Just have had so much fun with it already. The boat is a very durible boat as are the other boats made by Intex. I love this boat so much, I plan to take it to the pool every chance i get during the summer.The boat is a good boat for either the beginer, or an expert who just wants a fun boat at a low pice. The pump that comes with the boat is pratically useless for inflating the boat because the boat is so big. I used my high output pump to inflate the boat. I would recomend finding the Intex ""High Output Double Quick III pump to inflate the boat with ease."
4,fun for a toy,This only fits one adult. Its small and fun for a toy but not to be used as any serious paddling kayaking etc... it gets the job done but you have to lean back and row and opposed to sitting up and rowing. not too shabby for the price.
5,I'm sold; they made a difference,"I guess there's much debate about whether any particular connector is better than plain, bare wire. All I can say is, I bought a package of these plugs, connected them to my Polk LSi-15 speakers and Carver amps, and I'll be darned if my two-channel stereo didn't sound ""better."" With no change in volume or tone, individual instruments seemed more ""distinct."" I'm sold--these plugs made an audible improvement in my system's sound, compared to bare wire I used before. Nice!"
2,More Like Trying to Convert,Looks like this video is more like trying to convince people that Sai Baba is no ordinary human and convert viewers to devotees... this is the impression I get and does not provide a lot of info on the man. Very disappointing.
4,man of miracles- Sathya Sai Baba,"Iloved seeing Sai Baba do his thing amidst all the people he ministers to, but there was too much talking (too much of Rod Serling's voice and not enough of Sai Baba's Voice) Yet visually the film is beautiful. So I recommend viewing it with some good Indian Music and turning the sound off"
2,"Should Be ""The Miracles of Sai Baba""",This video lets me know about his amazing feats than other things about him. I will look for other books/video to know more about this man.
2,Only for Miracles...,Doesn't let one know much about this godman but it does well in showing the feats performed by him.Now I know why people are attracted to him like houseflies.
2,"More of Miracles, Less About the Man","This video focuses too much on so-called miracles by Sai Baba and does not provide much information about him. If you are trying to find more details about him (birth, childhood, adulthood, his beliefs and teachings, etc.), you will find this video disappointing."
2,Mismatched Title,"I would consider the title to be a serious mismatch to the contents of the video. It should preferably by ""Miracles of Sai Baba"". In order for it to be ""Man of Miracles -- Satya Sai Baba"", the video should have show some of the miracles but MORE about Sai Baba. Viewers who are keen to know about the teachings, beliefs and detailed life of Sai Baba would be disappointed.What this video concentrates on is showing the so-called miracles of Sai Baba and I think its aim is more on convincing viewers that this is no ordinary man based on the miracles shown. In a way, it is perhaps trying to make the viewer think that this is a godman or even god. The video does not enable the curious viewer know about the background and detailed life history of Sai Baba.So if you want to know more about Sai Baba, this video will be disappointing and there is more available on the WWW on him than in the video."
2,It is a just a magic nothing spiritual,"There is no spirituality in this whole video. He is just a magician nothing else. There are more consumers for miracles rather than spiritual thoughts or teaching that is why he is so popular. He he just preach nobody listen to him, in order to gain people trust you need to do some magic stuff and prove you are godly like person. Hinduism says if you do good thing then your re-birth cycle will be stopped but he himself says he is re-birth of Siridi Sai Baba, who himself was the greatest son of god. If he can not break the cycle of rebirth, or complete his desire to be in this world then how any common man like us can break this re-birth cycle."
5,60 Years later Still Use Recipes - Easy Good Fudge,"I received my copy 60 years ago and still use it. It's a bit of nostalgia for me, but still like to make the fudge. It's an easy fool proof recipe. My wife likes my homemade fudge better than 90% of what she finds at candy counters. I use good chocolate and fresh nuts."
2,Not R72,"Hello!! I have a Canon XT modified camera from life pixel and used for astrophotography but for infrared as well. I've been using canon 60mm macro lense with a HOYA R72 infrared filter and photography looks bright even in not too hard sunlight conditions 5 or 6 pm (summer).Today I receive my ""Opteka HD 62mm R72 720nm Infrared X-Ray IR Filter"" and try some photos around 4:30pm and photos looks very dark with same configuration, I need more time for a better histogram.Looks like is not a R72"
2,"Blurry optics, extremely looooong exposure required for unmodded cameras.","No protective cover, poor packaging, arrived with one minor scratch. All images lack any definition whatsoever no matter how I try to compensate. With an unmodded DSLR at ISO 200 f/2.4 expect about a 10-15min exposure in bright direct sun.Would say its a waste of money but it was cheap... Waste of time? If you plan to use any images shot with it for anything besides personal entertainment, then yes."
4,"""that other elephant 6 band""","greatest hits type records can either dramaticly short change a band or it can provide an interesting perspective on a band's career. All in all, this is a pretty solid take on one of elephant 6's finest. My first reaction, however, was that otc never quite got back to ""california demise"" form. But if you're interested in the band i would recomend this collection as a great place to start (especially considering how difficult it is to find anything else from otc)"
2,noise that would awake batman.,"ok, I get it - the OLT gang are all into experimentalism and all that, and they are very groovy, oh yeah they are groovy. when they sing, they shine brightly, PET SOUNDS style with a twist, vodka music from early 20's. but they rarly sing. most of this cd is nothing but annoying time wating money wasting niplish special effect noise. OK, great, you are experimelntal, you are expanding our horizons, but why oh why can't you do this hearable?. songs like ""late music 2"" are just unworthy. the thin line between art and just plane poopoo isn't even available for the eye - this cd is way way in the poopoo land.go hear other E6 bands. go go go."
5,great job!,"The Book is in great condition! The shipping was timely and the price was excellent. Elleanor Burns instructions are complete and cover every issue. Easy to follow, and produce a lovely product!"
4,"Warning: May damage your speakers-irresistable, huh?","This CD jams but don't get it if you don't like electronica music. You are supposed to turn your volume down during the test tones to avoid damaging your speakers, but if you don't it brings bass in and out, in other words its awesome. So all you people with sound systems in your rides - you know what time it is!"
4,An interesting work for fans of drones only,"I am a huge fan of minimalism and had heard much about Alvin lucier before coming across this cd in my local record store. Let me start out by saying that it's challenging listening to say the least. I've probably listened to the whole thing maube six or seven times, and I just now feel that I'm starting to be able to appreciate it. These two pieces, like some of his other work, explore microtuning and the resonance of hollow vessels. The music itself is very drone like, but there are subtle changes if you listen hard enough. It quite reminds me of John Cale's work with the dream syndicate. One thing to note, I find it needs to be played quite loudly in order to distinctly hear the wave interference patterns, otherwise it will sound like little else than an extended drone."
4,A haunting portrait of a family & a forgotten way of life,"What could have been a lurid tale of murder and madness becomes in Cornwell's hands a elegant elegy for an eccentric family and a lost way of life. Robert, Alan and Frances Luxton, 2 brothers and a sister from an ancient farming family in Devon, England, died violently in the mid-1970's. Though this true tale was well (and sensationally) documented by the British press at the time, the story is probably unknown to most American readers. Cornwell journeyed to Devon to ostensibly uncover the mystery of their deaths. Instead, as he interviews neighbors and friends in the isolated community, he assembles a portrait of not only Robert, Alan and Frances, but of their once wealthy family, its tragedies and eccentricities. The Luxton family becomes a detail in the landscape of an almost vanished way of life in one of the most mysterious corners of England."
2,Disney - not great,"I absolutly LOVE disney, anything disney and especially the music. I'm not saying these singers arn't good, cos they are great, its just they are trying to sing disney songs and i was really appauled when i heard it, because it sounds awful. I really think that the actual people who sang the disney songs should sing them and no one else, it sounds like abit of a rip off. The songs themselves are fantastic, its just the way they are sang is abit tacky. I wouldnt recommend this cd to anyone."
4,Peter Pan The Book.......,"It was an okay book i liked it, it just left out alot of stuff but it showed alot of good pics of Jeremy he is so hot.Then like it showed other pics but not the one where they KISS...."
4,Good typing practice,"I bought this as practice for my 8-year-old granddaughters who took typing in school this year. Have only had it a few days, but they are glued to it during their free computer time. It enourages touch-typing and accuracy.We've found only one flaw. One of the girls pressed the back-arrow to see what would happen and she lost several chapters of the work she had completed. I'm not sure what caused the glitch -- expect it was operator error, but couldn't identify it.They are having a lot of fun practicing, and they are improving speed and accuracy in a short time. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I think a children's program should make it difficult to wipe out completed work. If it weren't for that, I would give it 5 stars."
3,Typing Instructor,"My daughter loves Typing Instructor. They use it at her elementary school. The only problem with this version is that if your child has any experience at all with typing, they will go through version 3 in a few hours."
5,FREE LEONARD PELTIER,Many Blessings to all those who took part in this CD for Leonard and his family. May the meaning of these lyrics ring out loud for all to hear and understand. Very Powerful as sad.
1,Agreed.... not worth the money!,I have waited years for a book on Newman and was very disappointed by this attempt. Courrier is a lefty and tried to interweave his political views in every Newman song to the point where is became so not about the subject matter - Newman himself. Still waiting for a true biography on Randy...
5,Excellent training on how to discipline yourself in life!,"This tape series taught me how to lead a disciplined and mentally tough life. It applies to both professional and personal aspects of my life. The teaching is simple with lots of real life examples. It even taught me how to stay patient while sitting in a traffic jam!! I highly recommend this to anyone who is challenged at any time by lack of discipline, stress, anger, and/or frustration in life!"
5,Genuine Konica Minolta gives peace of mind,"We have tried a few remanufactured units and they always quit on us. Our Konica Minolta Magicolor 2300W & 2300DL printers are networked, so we are sending print jobs remotely from different offices and don't need printers quitting on us where we can't see them. No Problems if you use Genuine KM."
2,not as good as the other leap videos,"Compared to other leap videos, this one falls short. It spends more than half the video teaching counting from 1 to 10 and blasts through the addition and subtraction without much explanation. The video should have assumed the kid knows how to count to 10 and focused on the title of ""math circus"" and its claim to teach addition and subtraction. Do look to other leap DVD titles like letter and word factory I & II those are great!"
3,Too much for one video,"We have both Letter Factory and Talking Words Factory, which were amazing at teaching beginning reading to our preschooler. Those were definitely five star videos. This one, although fun, tries to pack in too much information at one time. Ideally they should have made two separate introductory math videos: one for addition and one for subtraction. If it stuck to the nice slow pace it began with, and stuck to addition it would've been great. But it speeds up too quickly with addition, and then starts throwing subtraction at you as well. Maybe the Leap Frog Company will realize this and decide to make some new, better versions of this video."
3,It's ok....,"We got the letter factory for our little one and were very pleased. It is engaging, and set at a good pace. Our little one knew the alphabet before age 2, I believe, in part due to this video. Then we bought math circus. We are sooo dissapointed. The pace is ridiculous. It begins counting 1-10, with some imaginary thing called a Quidget(?). Then it proceeds to addition and subtraction at an incredible pace, and ends with multiplication, 10x10. So basically your child is expected to go from counting to 10 to times tables. I wish they had devoted one video to learning to count, one for addition/subtraction, and one to multiplication. I really DO Not recommend this video."
2,Could have been much better,"In its defense, I'll say that my child loves to watch this. However, I wasn't wanting only entertainment, I was wanting quality education. And my child likes almost all children's videos.My complaints are that speech of the characters is difficult to understand, the sound is harsh, the visuals are unnecessarily busy and the action happens too fast. Its more entertainment than education. The concept of adding is introduced but the addition tables not taught. A child that can already count will get very little from this other than amuzement."
4,Great Series,I love these Leap Frog DVD's. I don't think this one is as good as the Reading/Letter one's but it is still good. My daughter (3 years old) doesn't stay in front of the tv watching it like she does the other ones. I think it is a little hard for her so she doesn't pay as much attention. The ideas go pretty fast for this age I think. A little hard for them to grasp all at once. I think she will get it over time though.
1,"Starts out too simple, then gets complicated too quickly!","I bought this hoping my five year old would learn the concepts of adding, and I was very disappointed. It starts off counting from 1-10 which was way too basic for my son, and quite repetitive and boring, then without explanation it starts addition without explaining how to add! And the use of the faceless boxes to represent numbers was just confusing. The dvd really dragged on. I would not waste money buying it! I do like the Leap Frog Phonics dvds, especially with the funny professor but his character is a real let-down in this dvd. Save your money and buy a better dvd!"
3,Eh,"Eh, as a fan of the LeapFrog line I wasnt very impressed with this video especially being a math video. Its much too animated during the counting segments. It doesnt focus more on the simplicity of counting for children and children are far advancing in preschool so the numbers probably should have been 1-20 instead of 1-10. I recommend this for parents with toddlers but not those with kids that are in kinder or above."
5,Leap Frog Math Circus DVD,LeapFrog: Math CircusGreat video for the car. Both my 2 year old and 4 year old love it and watch it over and over. My youngest has been counting to 10 for a long time as a result and the 4 year old has been doing addition and subtraction as a result for months.
3,Good but not the best,"My son and I really liked the Letter Factory and Talking Words Factory so we thought this was no brainer, but we were some what disappointed. This video starts out with numbers 0-10 which he already knows. Then jumps quickly through addition and subtraction. Way to fast to learn the basics."
2,Disappointing,"Definately does not compare to the other Leap Frog movies. TryBrainy Baby - 123'sinstead. We loved (my 2 & 3 year old boys) Leap Frog's ""The Letter Factory"", but ""Math Circus"" was a huge disappointment (both entertainmnet & educational value)."
3,Mom of 6 year old.,"I was dissapointed that they only showed math at the end and it was gone over to fast. And it is for smaller children, for it only counts from 1 to 10. But it might be ok for younger child, my son is 6."
3,not interested in it,"My daughter is 3. She watched it a few times, but is not interested in it. She enjoyed Letter Factory better, which I also thought is better made and more interesting. Same comments for Math Circus & Math Adventures to the Moon."
5,LeapFrog: Math Circus and Learning DVD Set,"My little girl is 3 years old and not really where she needs to be on knowing her letters. Her PK teacher suggested these videos and she LOVES them. She gets ""Baby Tad"" and the flash cards (that came with the learning set) and watches with enthusiasm. She finds the flash card of the letter they are reviewing, as they are talking. She still doesn't know all of the letters, but I have definitely seen improvement! I'm sure that improvement will continue."
4,"not as good as the letter factory, but still very good","Since The Letter Factory set the bar for these LeapFrog videos, it's just really hard to match that gold standard! I would give The Letter FActory 100 stars if it went up that high! That said, this video is very well done, too, just not as superb as The Letter Factory. I show both of these videos in my Kindergarten class often and the kids love them! The one fault I find with this one, is it covers a few too many concepts in one video for my (classroom) needs. Part of the video is too easy and part of it is too hard. The kids tend to get a little bored when the concepts start going over their heads. I'm looking forward to trying the other number video that is out (the moon one)since it sounds like it is broken down into a more basic set of concepts, but I only have a VCR in the classroom and I can't find anything other than the DVD. DARN! I guess I'll have to invest in a DVD player for the classroom one of these days. . .LOL"
2,Disappointing,"We loved the Letter Factory for our kids, and really think it played an integral role in helping our daughter learn her letters and sounds. I was looking for the same type of ""fun"" video to reinforce the number concepts. This was clearly a disappointment, although my expectations were quite high! It didn't flow as nicely and went into the more difficult concepts too quickly without much background or explanation."
5,Excellent gift,I bougth this plus 3 more titles from leap frog for my 6 year old daugther. She loves it. Delivery was very fast just in time for christmas.
3,Not as good as the other Leap Frog videos,Not as easy to learn with as the other Leap Frog videos. It is good but moves too fast for little ones to catch on.
2,Not as good as the Letter Factory or Word Factories 1&2..,"I bought this DVD after my son learned most of his letters from the letter factory. My son enjoys the other 3 Leapfrog DVD's but since day 1 he just walks away from this one. It's boring.. they don't spend enuff time on the numbers themselves (but it did teach him the number 0 wich I'd forgotten about) and the quidgets don't even count out the numbers (ex. they say 3+2=5 instead of 3+2=5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) If your child already knows his/her numbers than maybe it'll be more interesting to them. My son doesn't ask for this video.. I recommend BumbleBee Kids 123's or Brainy Baby 123's. If all else fails there's Sesame Street's 123 Count With Me (wich my son LOVES and asks for almost every day). This DVD was a waste of time and money, I'm going to try Richard Scarry's 123's and probably will sell this one on eBay.."
3,My kids like but I'm not crazy about it.,My 3 and 4 year old daughters like it. My eldest is learning addition so she understands it. However I was surprised that the format isn't very clear. It seems to quickly jump from counting to addition then to subtraction (a more difficult concept). I wouldn't recommend it unless your child has had some exposure to addition. And I agree with another reviewer about the attitude on Mr. Websley. This is the first LeapFrog video I've bought; not sure if I'll buy more.
3,Could be better,"I have to agree it was disapointing. I would not go as far as not teaching anything, But there is definitly a hotch potch of information here. I think it reinforces the visual numerals, and shows there is more than counting to numbers, but I do not think the adding and subtracting in the way they have shown it will teach much to a child without previous adding and subraction knowledge. Maybe a good reviewing tool. However compared to their other products this is not at all comparable. Maybe rent it or borrow from a friend before buying this one...I had high hopes for this product, glad I purchased the video not the DVD!"
2,Leapfrog Let Down!!!!!,"Like other reviewers I was dissapointed with this DVD. There are too many concepts being introduced in the 35mins. Leapfrog would have been better to make 3 separate DVD's - Numbers to 20, Addition, Subtraction. I am a school teacher and you never introduce number sentences (3+2=5) until children have a firm understanding of basic nember concepts (one to one correspondence, number order, before and after etc...). The DVD is still entertaining for children but I wouldn't recommend buying this one for educational purposes. Maybe Leapfrog should stick to words and letters!!!!!"
5,Leap Frog- Math Circus,"As a pre-kindergarten teacher,I think that this is an excellent way to introduce number groups and even simple addition and subtraction methods. The children really learn number groups faster and not just random counting."
2,Disappointed,I have to start by saying that I love leap frog products. In this case I was highly disappointed. It does not explain the concept of math it just starts adding things together. The songs were not intertaining and my 3.6 year old was not interested. Overall not a good purchase.
4,Tries to cover too much in one show,"I think this DVD tries to cover too much content: counting, adding, and subtracting. It jumps from counting, to counting in 10's and mixing up adding and subtracting, and can only serve as a mere INTRODUCTION to numbers/math. Also the sound quality was not as good as the other Leap Frog DVD's I own. Nonetheless, my kids still request to see it occasionally and they have learned to count in 10's up to 100."
4,Nice video to help kids learn numbers and counting,"Learn Math is a good DVD for the kid who does not know his numbers well.This is for beginners. It does at one point count in 10's but it is just a short part of the video. It focuses on 1-10 and does not do much adding or subtracting. It is very good for maybe a 3 year old, but kidsin Pre-school or Kindergarden might find it a little too easy. My son seems to want to leave the room when it is on. It does not keep his attn. as all the other leap frog video's do. This is the only one that I have seen that he does not sit through. Maybe he is not a MATH person,but this is not exactly MATH, it is more like counting and number recognition. Which IS great, no doubt, just buy it earlier in your childs life. My son is 4 years and 4 months - maybe he is a little ahead of other kids, not sure...? He has been counting since he was 2."
3,Okay For Counting,We don't enjoy this video as well as we do the Letter Factory and Word Factory videos. The emphasis is more on counting than on what I consider math. The sequence on addition and subtraction is so quick that I believe it's difficult for a little one to grasp.
1,BEWARE-FIRE HAZARD,OUR HUB OVERHEATED AND MELTED AND WOULD HAVE STARTED A FIRE IF WE HAD NOT FOUND IT WHEN WE DID. WE BOUGHT IT 6 WEEKS BEFORE IT OVERHEATED AND THE ELECTRICAL CORD WAS PLUGGED IN AN OUTLET-----OUTLET WAS FINE----UNIT DEFECTIVE.
2,Slow!,Does not operate at full USB speeds. I have to plug things directly into the computer to go fast. They go much slower when connected to this hub.
2,Disappointed,Insufficient padding to provide any noticeable protection. My current Under Armor padding is far superior.
3,Great Mix of Music!,"When I first listened to this CD, I noticed that there were a lot of different styles of jazz, and that for one thing is what makes the album so good. No matter what mood you're in, you'll always be in the mood for Swing This, Baby! I just want to say that I love the song ""Black and White"" by ""Bellevue Cadillac""! It gives the album a 40's kind-of feel to it and you should also listen to ""We still Talk The Way That Lovers Do"". That is another great track! Overall, its a great CD!"
5,Great selection and variety!!,"Wow, I am truly impressed with this CD. It has all the right tunes and besides a slight bit of immodesty on the cover, hey. So, buy it. You won't be disappointed in it. While you're listening, Swing This, BABY! is definitely danceable. SWING HEIL!"
4,"great swing, but lacks that extra enerygy.","If you like to swing, you'll love this CD...it only lacks a little extra energy (the kind that pulls you onto the dance floor.) But if you gotta dance and love swing this CD is great!!!"
1,SINS OF OMMISSION!,"As this collection does not include the two best neo-swing bands, Indigo Swing and Big Time Operator, it is next to useless. Sure, there's some good stuff here (Red and the Red Hots), but why waste time buying this incomplete CD when you get much of the same stuff (a better Steve Lucky song: ""Jumptown"") with no Cherry Poppin's Daddies to wreck the mix, plus Indigo and Big Time operator, the two best bands around, on the competing compliation ""Hipsters, Zoots, and Wingtips."" Run out and get that; don't be fooled by this minor compilation!"
2,Was a tad bit wack!!!!,"I used to live in Florida for a couple of yrs (in the early 90's),and I used to hear a lot of bangers from the bottom boys.But it seems like it was just those few hits that I heard,that were the ones that were hot.There are only like 3 songs on this best of that I like,and i was completely disappointed.I thought it would be straight Miami flava,but instead,I got a Florida sour lemon.You would be better just buying the albums themselves,because this one is not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A beautiful companion to Chagall's artwork,"i hesitated to buy this, but I am very glad I did. Chagall's writing is very much a literary version of his paintings, sculptures and windows. Poetic, expressive, slightly edgy, and providing lots of insight to the life of this extraordinary artist. Worth every penny."
3,"Not his best, but lots of action, which I like.","Matt (Steven Seagal) is an out-of-work, out-of-luck ex-cop who struggles to keep his weekly visits with his young daughter, and battles constant drinking and gambling problems. A mysterious gray-haired man dubbed Blue (Lance Henriksen) buys up Matt's bookie tickets and gambling debts and propositions him to become a hitman. Lots of twist and turns. Good enough !!"
3,Good action scenes & fight scenes with a pretty blah storyline...,"This is one of the better ""direct to video"" efforts from Seagal in recent years. No corny props or annoying voice dubbing. The fight scenes look good and there's a nice balance between shoot-outs and the use of Aikido. No highly obvious stunt doubles as well. Plus, I really like how the movie was filmed - VERY nice camera work on this. And very good use of slow-mow cameras and sound effects. All-in-all a well-shot, produced and directed movie. But, as with most Seagal films, there's always a catch. In this film it is the very bland and unengaged storyline. Crooked cops, Seagal gets framed, blah, blah, blah...However, I did like how at the end of the film, there is no attempt to take him from ""bad guy"" to ""good guy."" And I give really high marks for a well-made film.Final Grade: B-"
3,I wasn't very impressed with that movie!,"Stevan Seagal is an ex-cop who is heavy in debt due to gambling, gets contacted by the ""Old Man"", who gives him murder assignments of specific corrupt people. He takes on these assignments in exchange for money and payment of his debts.I am not really sure what was about this movie that made it lack spirit. Was it the fact that Seagal had put on lots of weight and doesn't look like the dangerous fighter we knew before? Or was it the dull character he portrayed in the movie? I suppose it also could be the unnecessary vulgar phrases we heard such as at the one at the very end when he said ""You cremate now mother .....""The aikido scenes were ok, but still nothing compared to the scenes in ""above the law"" or ""hard to kill"".The story is ok, nothing outstanding."
1,BoreFest starring Seagal's Body Doubles,"Another Seagal film and another waste of my time! If the movie was 20 minutes long it would be one of the greatest action films of all time. I can't stand these low budget films, I hate how instead of giving us what we want we're subjected to seeing Seagal walk around talking and smiling for 90 minutes. If the man could act, if the script was well written, then it would be a different story. When we do get action, it's mostly body doubles. The only good thing about this film is the final shootout at the graveyard. It was done like a pro but they obviously put their entire budget into that and relied on the script and Steven for the rest. The movie is a failure and should be avoided.I also saw Van Damme's new film The Shepherd which comes out the same day and it was freaking spectacular. It was filled with martial arts, high octane car chases and tons of action. Why can't Seagal give us that?"
2,only one scene.....,"the other folks said it all...there was just one scene that touched and that was when he looked in the fridge and sighed...""Man, I ain't got xxxx""That did it for me. Because at this point in my personal journey, I feel likewise"
2,And the past will slowly go by,"Each time a new Seagal movie is released on DVD, I watch it in the vain hope that it will be at the least better than the last.Each time there is some disappointment, in Pistol Whipped it is the start and the end where Seagal in slow motion crosses a line of gunfire, turns and fires apistol without looking and without being hit. There is certainly a lot of mirth in the movies.The sad thing is that I really need to come to terms with the fact that his best days are behind him, as are his best movies, and it is time to find a meaner, leaner martial arts fighter-actor.Worth a watch but do not expect too much."
2,Not one of his better DTV films,"Was looking forward to watching this but was a little disappointed. It seemed to start out ok but got kind of lost and bored in the middle of it. There was a lot of action but did not think the storyline was well put together. There have been a lot of his DTV movies I just could not enjoy, yet they seemed to have the ingredients to be better for some reason. I would not put this one on my list of favorites.Peter J. Miller"
4,Nice and Fun learning video,Leapfrog and Amazon are names I have come to trust. Video is fun and able to capture attention of my kids and have already heard my 5 yr old using some of the lessons.
5,Another Great Video From Leap Frog!,"This video (along with all the other Leap Frog Videos) is amazing. ""When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking,"" is one of the main ideas. It is great for beginning readers. I have a 2nd grader, Kindergartner, and preschooler...they all love this video."
2,Scary,"We have four Leap Frog videos, and my kids enjoy them a lot. I borrowed this one from Netflix, to try it out before buying it. I'm glad I did so. My daughter became very upset when the ""voices"" of the vowels were removed. The point was to show how vowels make different sounds. She was so upset by that part that she was unable to watch the rest of the video, even though she really wanted to. I am disappointed."
3,Leap Frog-Talking Words Factory 2-Code Word Caper,"This is a nice dvd that assists with words and letters. It is not one of the best on the market, but it served its purpose."
5,Great video!,"This video has been a great help to teach my children how to spell some words. The songs also really help you to remember the spelling rules. It helps me too. When doing their spelling, I say ""Remember the song?"" Then we start singing it. All of the Leapfrog videos have been a great addition to our homeschooling!"
5,One of the best on the market,"I couldn't think of a simple way to explain silent ""e"" to my children. Fortunately, this video does an excellent job. After viewing it I couldn't believe I had wasted two days trying to explain something that literally took the kids 30 seconds to learn."
5,Awesome Video in the Series....,"We have the first two videos in the series... and this third one is terrific. It is a logical flow from the first two, building on what we already know about sounding out words to read.The songs are catchy and help the kids to remember the rules.These videos have helped to support the reading efforts we are making at home. (my kids are preschoolers)."
5,Great!,"Leap Frog DVDs has helped my 4 children to learn phonics, numbers, letters, everything so kept buying the DVDs as gifts."
5,The kids love it!,The kids really enjoy this video (and all from this series). They have been telling us what words are 'complex words' in everyday conversation - something I didn't know before watching this video with them myself!
4,Entertaining (for kids) and Educational,"As another reviewer wrote, you need to get the other DVDs in the series first in order to build up to the skills taught in this one. (Unless, of course, your child already knows letters sounds, blends, etc.) The content is a little hokey but the kids like it and it is for them, after all. I would recommend it."
5,Amazing!,"They're geniuses! Our son loves it, as he did The Letter Factory and the Talking Words Factory. I can't take most of the credit for teaching him to read, but I can at least take credit for having the smarts to buy these videos."
1,Same DVD new name,"I was excited to buy a ""new"" DVD but I was very disappointed to find out it was the same as ""Code Word Caper."" The only thing new about this is a slightly different name and packaging. I otherwise like the series but they should not be allowed to call it new. It was a waste of money to buy the same thing twice so I have it 1 star."
5,great movie,This is a great follow up to letter factory and teaches deeper reading skills for those that are ready. My son likes it.
4,This book contains too much information for a person representing themselves!,"In my opinion, this book contains too much information. I think it is good for those who have one or two issues when going to court, but for someone new to the court system to have to read this book is too much. It literally talks about the design of the courtroom, courtroom personnel, and so forth. This is one of those ""forest for the trees"" type books. In other words, you can't get a true picture of the court system because there are too many trees in the way.My recommendation:If you are panicking about the whole idea of going to court, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!If you have questions about particular issues related to going to court, then DO READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Legal Self-help,"So far, it's very good. So much information in this book that I have to take it in measured quantities. This is a serious topic requiring thought, research and more. I will diligently follow through with the author's recommendations but know that they will require time and effort. This topic is hotter than hot since legal advice is now so expensive that it's impractical. Note that I have given the review only four stars since I'm not finished with the book as yet, and then there will be the acid test - was the advice sound? But as I said, so far -- heavy duty and helpful."
3,A little to broad to be really useful,"I purchased this book because Sara Berman is an awesome professor and she recommended it for law students who are studying for the CBX because it has examples of different documents that might show up on the Performance Test portion of the exam. It does do that, but I found that in general the book lacks meat. As a practicing attorney, I find it too broad to be useful, but maybe for a pro per it may be just simple enough to be helpful. I guess I am not the best judge."
5,We are in court and have the bank working hard fighting us.,"We are doing just fine for 2 lay people. An attorney said that we have done very well, he thought to get this far that we had an attorney. This book has great tips and it has helped us to this point. also the delivery was ordered late but it showed up the next day by fedex! Couldn't have went to the book store that fast!Thanks Amazon!!!"
2,Good but too basic.... you cannot use this alone to go to trial,"Very informative.... but not quite detailed enough.You cannot use this book alone to go to trial... or even to file a Complaint or a Motion. It gives general explanations but seriously misses a beat in the details. It would be more accurate if Nolo sold this as a supportive ""basic knowledge"" book and NOT a ""how to try your case"", book.And as a suggestion I would say that they should have more detailed books that are customized per states? That actually get into the nitty gritty, for instance, how to actually fill out a Complaint Cover Sheet? ect. This book just tells you you need to start your Lawsuit by filing a Complaint. Thats hardly an explanation of how to actually fill out the forms, what each form means, ect.NOLO is a wonderful resource... but they could be SO much bigger and better."
3,Great Book for Yesteryear!,"There are people who love James Dean and Marilyn Monroe. This is the ""Casablanca"" - a great B/W movie for Functional Analysis. But, we are in a different age of big screen movie full of digital effects and sound effects. You are charged for a full price to watch an old master piece. My rating for this book is based on today's standard. Although, it is not fair for the book, but it is an unfortunate must for the reader! Of course, there are old books who stood firm in modern standard, e.g. Kolmogorov and Fermin's Introductory Real Analysis and Rudin's Functional Analysis. My rating for whether the school library should buy this book and its Part II and III is a definitely five stars!!! For beginners, my advise is don't read this intimidating thick book."
4,This is the one!,"If you are using Monster cables and want to change gender of terminals (from male to female) then this is the option you must use if you want to have very low signal lost and no distorsion. With 24K gold finish and a very short design this product offers a very high quality option in terminals gender change. I have used four of them in an interface between the DVD and the Sony Play Station and it has worked out perfectly. I have no complaints, this is a great product."
1,A Word Of Caution,I bought this book and I read it myself before reading it to my children. I am so glad I did. It is trying to normalize homosexulaity. It says some families have 2 mommies or 2 daddies. This is not appropriate for children.
5,Perfect for ALL Families!!!!!!!,"Wonderful! I purchased this book for my 4 1/2 yr old adopted daughter. What is perfect about this book is it's not just for certain types of families.....IT'S FOR ALL FAMILIES!!In a bright, cheerful, and simple way, this book shows children that families are different. They are small and big, look different and alike, and live close and far... There are stepmoms and dads, stepsiblings, adopted children, two moms, two dads, and one or two parent families.... In between showing the differences, it also shows what all families have in common. With all of their variations, there is still love and they are still a family!This is not just for a child who fits in one of these unique families, but for ALL children that could benefit from the knowledge of diversity."
3,Not a bad starting place,"The book has fantastic, bright pictures, but there is not much text. It does give a good starting place for conversations with our children about adoption, but it doesn't give quite enough for us. Also, it does talk about families that have two moms or two dads. That may be an issue for some parents."
2,Homosexual propaganda,"My 2 yr. old checked this book out from the library today. Luckily I read ahead and am great at changing the words into a believable text for the books we read.When we got to two moms and two dads, I had to change the wording because that is against our beliefs. We believe families are a mom a dad and children, or a hope for children.I am glad that Amazon gives a wording review so that you can see what you are buying."
5,Very Happy Family,I got this book for my 2.5 year old nephew. he loves the book so much and asks to have it read to him over and over again. Todd Parr's books are great!
3,good for young children,"Simple, but that's what one wants for young children. It's a little too simple for my 4 year olds as far as text, but they adore the pictures! Very bright and eye catching."
4,Did the Job!,"Although I was hoping to get a hard cover edition of this book, I was able to allow the students to use it during centers. Good condition."
5,Joyful Read,"This is a great book that reinforces that family is not one definition, but many. It is helping me to build that appreciation of other family types within my young son.My son gets so excited when I open the book. The primary colors and simple use of graphics grab his attention page one. He wants me to read it to him repeatedly. The great line in the book, that I love, "" Family makes us strong."""
5,Love this Book!,My mother-in-law read this to my kids & they loved it so much I decided to purchase my own copy. It's a favorite in our house. I would definatly recommend the book to anyone w/ little kids.
2,a gross disapointment,This was supposed to be in good condition. Yeah.. if it had been recovered from the Titanic. The front and back covers were water swelled and weak. The inside pages were o.k. but overall it was a terrible disappointment.
5,A pleasure to read,"This book was a pleasure to read. The 'Trail of Tears' is a dark period in American history, born out of stupidity, bad leadership, intolerance, and pure arrogance and narcissism. But from that, comes the tale of one modern American aboriginal who re-traces her people's steps. All 1,800 miles, while fending off nature, and evil minded men. Unlike most books that has crisp, tight grammar, Ms. Adams writes as she speaks. Concise, to the point, blunt as a club, but with compassion, and caring that only one like her could do. This is a must read for anyone interested in American Indian works, and especially one who's lead a difficult but interesting life as she. I'd recommend all three of her previous books. 5 stars? She deserves 10.- Kevin C. Redden"
3,an old chicken makesa good salse,i really prefered the older cd but even this one is a good one. Good atmosphere and good relaxing. Really turbed this Rollerball.
3,So-so,"Bought this book after reading some of the author's articles and the rave reviews here. It is more like a style guide (it focuses on tenses, font, grammar) than a substantive legal drafting guide. It is very nitpicky regarding the English language, to the level where if you adhered to every rule, you would be closer to a fuddy duddy phD candidate type than a practitioner. It reminds me of the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers. I much prefer Charles Fox's Working With Contracts - What Law School Doesn't Teach You, which is more practice-oriented and actually explains each clause, and its the purpose and meaning. Every junior associate should receive Fox's book as a present when they start their first year."
3,Good in compilation but not in quality.,"I admired that there are many great songs in this CD. And that's also my reason to buy this title. However, I'm disappointed when I compared some of them with the original CD that I have. The middle sound is boost up so you'd mostly hear the voice of singer. Regardless to the comparison of Carrie (Europe) and Wind of Change (Scorpions) with the original CD, I even think High Enough (Damn Yankees) in Power Ballads (FLASHBACK) is better, i.e. has more details in treble and bass. So all my points go to the number of big songs. If you love a good collection, this might be a good one. However if you like the quality sound of music, I'd rather recommend Power Ballads (FLASHBACK). ... Thanks for your attention."
4,Not just for heavy metal fans...,"I am not a heavy metal fan, but I have to say that this is a cool album, a compilation of some of the best rock ballads. I would recommend this album to any rock fan, not just heavy metal fans."
4,Great Ballads that make you get into a loving mood.,"These ballads are great! I can't get enough of them! It's not the best I've heard, but it is great! If you like Metal, this is for you! Order now!"
4,love making music,"I was looking for some intense, sexy music, and this cd has some songs that totally pass the test, especially ""Can You take me High Enough"". I think I might just have to buy this cd!"
4,Takes Me Back,"Now here is a CD that takes me back. I grew up on this stuff and listening to it took me back to those nights sitting around with the guys, smoking our cigarettes and playing cards or cruising. If you want a CD that will take you to an earlier time, then look no farther. ""Monster Ballads"" is it. From the 1st song to the last, there is nothing but the best of 80's and early 90's ballad rock. These guys were the Marvin Gayes of the rock wopld and this album proves beyond a doubt that love is still alive.Enjoy."
1,Dropkick Murphys dropped the ball on this record,"I am only a fan of the Dropkick Murphys first ep's and full length CD. They should have hung it up after the first lead singer left (but he does have a new band, Street Dogs, for those who care). However, the new Dropkick Murphys keep topping themselves with worse and worse CDS with every release. This new CD Blackout is a lame and boringly written, and along with the sound changing so did the energy. Keep your money and go buy a pogues cd. (Woody would be rolling over in his grave)"
1,I want my $ back.,"If you're looking for the ""Boys on the docks"" with that ""Do or die"" attitude well the ""Gang's.."" NOT ""..all here."" Yes, Ben Casey and the newbies don't cut it. This is not the DKM we know and love. I am mailing my copy back to them tomorrow...If ya like cheesy love-like ballads, and way too obvious want-to-be ""Oi"" sing alongs, by all means buy it."
3,Good Album...Worth Buying,"Let me start by saying I'm from South Boston and have been listening to these guys for a long time, so this review might be a little biased. This record clearly shows the progression of the band and its maturity, thus, most of the songs lack the edge and agggression most punks might expect. However, this album is still true to the Dropkick name and is worth a spin if you're a fan.If you want to hear their best record, pick up ""Do or Die"" on Hellcat Records. And if you want to hear their punkest stuff for short money, grab the ep ""Boys On The Docks"" from 1997 on Cyclone Records."
5,"Attention losers, bastards and cheats!","I adore Dropkick Murphys so before I even heard ""Blackout"" I knew it would be glorious. I had no idea how glorious it could be though. From the second I put the cd on, I was in audio Irish punk heaven. Blackout is a bit more traditional Irish sounding and a little less punk than other DKM albums but that is what I love about it. My favorite tracks are ""Black Velvet Band"", ""World Full of Hate"", ""The Dirty Glass"", ""Fields of Athenry"", and the awesome, ""Bastards On Parade"". ""Bastards"" may be my all time favorite track from the Murphys. The lyrics call to arms all of the ""losers, bastards, cheats, vagrants and barflies"" Who among us does not fit into one of the afformentioned catergories. The song is reminiscent of ""Sit Down"" by James, not in style but in subject. Great tracks throughout and the bonus dvd just adds to the glory that is Dropkick Murphys."
3,It has it's good and bad moments. At least it's energetic,"The album isn't actually bad. It doesn't have the spirit as the previous albums but it's worthy. It has a couple of Irish traditionals done to punk rock along with the title track of ""Blackout"" which was written by the Gutherie clan and given to Dropkick Murphys.It has some good moments and bad moments, but it's not a weak effort. It just may not have that same appeal as past albums to older fans. The tracks ""The Dirty Glass"", ""The Workers Song"", and ""Fields Of Athenry"" along with their cover of ""Black Velvet Band"" make it energetic."
5,this is for all you idiots who think youre so cool...,"I LOVE BLACKOUT JUST AS MUCH AS ALL THEIR OTHER ALBUMS!!! all you morons who say that you're behind dkm all the way, but then contradict yourself by saying that you hate Blackout...you don't deserve to even express your opinion. Blackout is awesome! just as great as sing loud, sing proud, do or die, the gang's all here, live on a five, etc...dkm has been keeping up the god work for 7 years now and by my standards, they've gotten better, just like their work has. so all you out there saying that Blackout sucks, think about how much you really are behind them, becase you're not.worker's song-kiss me i'm s**tfaced: all f*cking great!!!"
4,It is the Murphys enough said.,Was never really into the Murphies but my wife had some random albums about. Now I am hooked all I can say.
2,Dropkick Murphy's have suffered a major blackout,"...This album is way too folky and they've lost their edge. No more exciting guitar riffs and captivating drum beats. The pipes are piercing. Ken Casey can only be tolerated for so long. The last thing we need is for DKM to become the next Flogging Molly. DKM are almost hardcore, they're badass guys like in Barroom Hero.If you like Al Barr check out his old band The Bruisers. You'll find that even he came hard back in the day. Bloodshed is an awesome song.I don't want to bash the band, but please respect the older goodies."
2,What the f@#k happened!,"One of my favorite bands has left me with a bad taste in my mouth after hearing Blackout. While there are a few good tracks on here most don't come even close to their previous stuff. The version of ""Dirty Glass"" sucks my ass. The original on the split they did with Face To Face had a different singer on the female vocals and she was vastly superior. The biggest problem with this album are the vocals. What the hell happened to the amazing vocals of Al Barr (Bruisers forever), he seems to have disappeared on this album. Ken Kelly should stick to playing bass. He's okay singing a line or verse here or there but his vocals are far too prominent on this album. I know he's the only original member left but that doesn't mean he should make himself the focal point of the whole album. If I was Al Barr I'd be pissed!"
2,Another commercial victim,"It seems that alot of the bands that USED to have a hard edge are going broke. This has to be the case because The Murphys were the last band I figured would roll over for money. Well it happened. This album is a total and complete disappointment. If you love DO or Die and The Gangs All Here, avoid this disc. The edge is gone and has been replaced with....basically nothing. The whole disc just seems empty of any heart that was on the other discs. It gets two stars for the use of Bagpipes, but as for anything else worthy of mentioning, I have yet to find it."
3,not their best work,"I'll admit, I was disappointed with this album, but all in all it's still a decent buy. But I'd equate this album with the BossTones' album ""Let's Face It""... An attempt to go 'mainstream' that results in a loss of that raw sound that made them such a pleasure to listen to."
1,Do or Die Fans Stay Away,"It seems a lot of the positive reviews here are from DKM fans that thought Sing Loud, Sing Proud was the Dropkick's best album. I liked Sing Loud, but I really thought it was a shadow of Do or Die. With Blackout the DKM continue to distance themselves from their premier album.With Blackout, I think, the DKMs just sound like a high-school punk band that's trying to model themselves after the DKMs of old. Their celtic, blue-collar, everyman, sing-along style which was at its most potent in Do or Die, and was still powerful in tracks like The Gauntlet and The Spicy McHaggis Jig on Sing Loud, now seems to have been replaced with the common teenage punk rage of most punk bands.I'm sure most punk fans will like this album. For those, like me, who felt the DKMs were a band that brought something new to the genre back with Do or Die, I think those days are past."
2,Worst Murphys Record Ever. . .,"Dammit! Whats happened to these guys? Everything has slowed down and gotten pretty boring. Al, who was once a great aggressive frontman has now decided to lose his edge and try to actually carry tunes instead of just growling the lyrics like he used to. I also liked them much better as the 4 piece they once were. It would be tough to still classify these guys as punk rock anymore. . .as far as musical styles go anyway.Nothing beats The Gangs All Here or anything recorded when Mike was still singing with them. Dont bother with this one if youre a fan of the older stuff."
4,Really sophisticated pop,"I haven't heard anything about this album other than what I've heard in my own head, and I don't know why. This is the perfect bright spring or summer day album. The songs are beautiful, with nice horn arrangements and a great laid-back feel. This is an album for fans of Belle and Sebastian's lazier moments, the Kingsbury Manx with a heavy dose of Spring, the Essex Green with less essex and more green, basically anyone who loves happy (but certainly not too happy) and pretty (but not annoyingly pretty) pop. This album offers an unparalleled sense of nostalgia on the most beautiful of spring days. As a self-proclaimed music geek, I highly recommend."
2,OVERPRICED,"This is a standard a.v. selector, made by monster cable. Monster cable does make some of the best cables around, they are all I use for my audio, even though they are a lil pricey. But monster means quality. But.... Its just not worth the price tag on this thing! For top of the line quality nothing beats this, but if you can afford this then you can afford a t.v. with 4 s video inputs such as the top of the line sony wega, so why not spend your money on that? Its good quality, but I think I'll spend my money for the $50 rca one, or even find another one for less, but if you got money to burn on a selector, go ahead, but the money can buy alot better things."
1,HP Print Server JetDirect 615N Ether 10/100 1xRJ45 Enhanced I/O (EIO) J6057A#ABF,"I bought this product a while ago and have not had the chance to review it until recently. I would not recommend anyone to spend a cent on this product unless you have some time to waste and nothing to do with your money. It worked for just a few days and stopped working. My research on the product revealed that the product should not have been on the market in the first place because it was recalled by HP.There is however, another product on the market which is quite expensive but is guaranteed to work (though I haven't bought one jet). If you are planning on buying this product, Think again!!!"
3,"big fan, but..........wheres the rest","fishs bbc recordings overall is a fine collection for beginners of the fish catologue but as a seasoned fan, as i am, i must say it lacks the deeper cuts that make all his records stand above the rest.... its just like a greatest hits live from 2 different times in his career........wheres lady let it lie??? etc.... we didnt need 2 versions of vigil or 2 different heart of lothians.....which basically sounds the same....i dont think fish had too much to say about this releasebut its not all bad and is enjoyable/recording quality is great as of compared to many other of his live releases....i would recommend....anything by fish cant be bad,,"
5,2 different shows and great music!,"It was at ""Punch and Judy"" that I realized that this was going to be a great musical experience. Although not a complete glimpse of his solo output by any means, the older Marillion material and songs like Big Wedge and Speaking in Tongues make these disks a pleasure to listen to. My only real complaint is the sound quality of the first show. Buy it!"
4,Lovely,"Enya's debut CD, with a booklet chock full of historical information about the numerous pieces. Highlight? The utterly haunting ""Boadicea"", the only one you might recognize, as it's been used in a handful of movie soundtracks, and was sampled by the Fugees in ""Ready or Not""."
3,Enya Has Done Better,"Don't get me wrong---I'm an Enya fan. When she good she's really good. But not this time. IF you buy this CD it will be for ""To Go Beyond""---a lullaby that is by far the best thing on the recording. And it's on there twice: surprise surprise. The other titles are slickly done chord changes with Enya going ""la la"" in the background, or bridge music marooned without a main melody. Buy it to complete your Enya library, otherwise borrow it from a friend and save some dough. There isn't much on it."
4,Great solo effort by Celtic/New Age Artist,"A good bit of this CD by Enya (late of Ireland's Clannad) consists of the soundtrack to a PBS production entitled ""The Celts."" The music is ethereal and quite interesting ... but not all of it could be considered traditional Celtic music at all. Enya composed these original tunes herself, and I would categorize them as more New Age in nature. One particularly noteworthy piece, apparently inspired by ""Star Wars,"" is entitled ""Aldebaran."" Quite beautiful, really. Enya's vocals are not particularly present on this particular outing, which is a shame. They are mainly used as texture along with her keyboards. Well worth investigating, but not her finest work."
1,Maybe I just don't get it,"Insubstantial, hollow, immature, synth-realized ""themes"". Light on vocals. Utter waste of time and money."
4,"Beautiful, yet gets repetitive","This is a gorgeous CD. The music beautifully reflects the Celts, from it's fiesty brutality to it's lovely and inspiring Pagan beliefs. However, the same ideas and sound 14 or 15 times over and over again do get a bit tiring. For meditation music, this is perfect. To listen to as a musical piece, it gets boring. I recommend Clannad, it's better."
4,Great Enya Sound,I knew this CD had been out for a while and if I would have known I would enjoy it so much I wouldn't have waited so long to purchase it. Great Enya sounds with a bit of a twist.
5,Enya is Without Equal,"If you need proof of the existence of a loving God, please simply listen to Enya. Why didn't anyone ever tell me about her? Why did I live more than 40 years before hearing her? This album is filled with wonders, starting with the title song, and building from there. The ""new age"" title is deceptive; don't let it discourage you. Enya will be listened to and adored by music lovers one thousand years from now. I cannot recommend her enough."
5,More adventurous than what came later...,"...this is easily Enya's most musically and artistically complex album (unless ""The Frog Prince"", which I have yet to hear, surpasses it). And just think, it is her earliest...Her artistic voice has developed since ""The Celts"", but here is where one finds her artistic wellspring. (I would give this album a 4.7 if I could -- if only because her ""voice"" is not as consistent on this album as on her later albums.) I hope she returns to that wellspring in the future, even as she absorbs and assimilates new influences."
5,Entertainingly Eerie,I must congratulate her for this album. I do not have it but I've heard it before. This is a new-age masterpiece.
5,If you're going to pick 1- This is it!,"I've never heard anything like this before. You never get tired of listening to this one. The songs are beautiful, relaxing and yet uplifting all at the same time!"
5,Get this,I belive Rockula is probly one of the best 80s movies I would put it up there with pretty in pink and st elmos fire Dean camron also did another movie called ski patrol and its sequal how ever the soundtrack is nonexistant the company that put out the movie went under it was bought out but the soundtrack was thrown out So in short for thoughs that miss the 80s and dream of returning or for thoughs that only dream of the 80s this movie is for you It also has toni Basil (And shes not a bad looking woman even now)
4,Great tunes!,"someone taped this movie for my dad a long time ago. that was the only video he ever owned. when our upstairs neighbors would disconnect our cable to hook it up their t.v., my dad and i were left with no choice but this. sure it's fluff, but it's good fluff, and the soundtrack is first rate. we never got tired of ""rockula"""
3,Beyond Cheesy,"This movie is beyond cheesy. The only person i liked in it was Toni Basil. I liked her singing and dancing. Other than that, it is one of those movies you can not take seriously, and that was not the purpose of the film, obviously the director wanted it to be funny as well. If you like the movie Cry Baby, than you probably would like this movie as well."
2,Rockula Rocks!!,"Yes, it really is a dumb movie, but so what? Not all movies are ""Gone with the Wind,"" or ""Titanic"" or the like. Rockula has goofy characters and a nutty plot. However, this movie does have one redeeming thing: it has some kicking music, with a particularly wicked performance by Toni Basil called ""The Night."" And, for those who find humor in such things, it's worth it just to see Bo Diddley in high top sneakers, biker shorts, a tank top, a yellow cape, and wire bats on springs waving around his head.They evidently did not come out with a sound track for this movie, and that's a shame. If there is a sound track out there, I hope someone lets me know where to find it. I've looked all over the place, and have yet to locate it.Who cares if the movie's dopey? Watch it for the tunes!!!"
5,Campy...very campy...you'll eat it up!!!,"ok, ok...so it's not Oscar caliber...but still...it's worth a watch. It's campy, light & frivolous...FANTASTIC!!! It's one of those movies that's so bad it's positively brilliant! Not to mention some good tunes by Toni Basil & Thomas Dolby...& the only vampire rap I know of!"
3,Campy Yet Entertaining,"For a B movie, it is surprisingly entertaining. For those of us that enjoy such, it is worth at least a first viewing."
1,"""Terrible""",Summer time heat requires waterproof mascara. Waterproof mascara tends to require a remover. Removers should be gentle so that you don't rub your eyes too much. Do not waste your money on this product. I've had better luck using Vaseline!
4,Raw Combination,MOP and Smif N Wess combine over the same beat from the LP and create magic. It ain't classic but its still 2 of the East Coast's dopest duos of the last 10 years. Thats tight. The B side is the real treat. Slide around in your socks to this.
2,good concept but way too pricey,"The main use of a product like this is to wire an office or home lan connecting for example a pc in one room with a router in another. In this situation you can use keystone jacks that fit into a special wallplate similar to a telephone jack. You punchdown the wire into the jack. Use premade patchcords from the pc to wallplate, router to wallplate etc. It's about 3 times as much as it should be for the quality of product."
4,"BTE's ""Achtung Baby""","Better Than Ezra has always had consistent songwriting capability, and there's no denying that they have a recognizable sound, but it has been fun to listen to the group mature up through this third CD. Their debut, ""Deluxe"", was impressive. They followed with ""Friction Baby"" which offered some strong songs, but lacked variety.""How Does Your Garden Grow?"" is aptly named, because this CD is all about variety. First, the band has taken their music into an electronic direction, although not to the point that the music is lost (as has happened with other bands who have gone this route).The songs range from just plain fun (""Happy Day MaMa"") to touching (""At The Stars"", ""Everything in 2s"") to poignant (""Beautiful Mistake""). There are definitely 2 or 3 songs on here which are sub-par, but the lion's share of this CD is endlessly pleasurable. A common reaction at parties when I play this: ""Who is this?"""
1,BTE almost lost me with this one,"I was very disappointed when I first listened to this CD. There are some good songs on this CD but BTE got away from the good guitar sounds of ""Deluxe"" and ""Friction, Baby"" on this one and instead relied heavily on synthesized music. The synthesizer sounds more like tape hiss than music on some of the cuts. This CD is not representative of the BTE sound on their other three releases. Although I do not recommend this CD, I highly recommend ""Deluxe"", ""Friction, Baby"", and ""Closer""."
5,"Once this Grew on me, I was caught","I love Better Than Ezra, but when I first bought this album I thought it might have fallen a bit short of their others. After seeing them perform some of the songs live, however, I decided to give it another chance. After listening to it repeatedly, I was hooked. It is an awesome album, once you give it a chance."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!,"As a huge fan of the ""Deluxe"" album, I felt ""Friction"" was a nice follow up. This latest album doesn't compare. I've heard it 3 times trying desperately to give it a chance but it's just not there. Maybe I'm getting older and mellower but this stuff stinks. It doesn't even sound like the BTE that I know."
4,"Not the same BTE, but it's still good BTE!!","I thought this CD took a little getting used to, but after listening through it a couple of times, it earned a permanent spot in my CD player! There's really no songs on the CD that I strongly dislike, but there are a few I tend to skip over. And there are those few -- ""At the Stars"", ""Live Again"", and ""Everything in 2's"" that I think are quite simply incredible. One thing I really like about HDYGG is that it has a good mix of faster songs with heavier guitars and the slower, softer ballads. This CD may be off the beaten path for BTE, but then again, they as a band are off the beaten path. It's what makes me such a huge fan!"
4,It's a album with a beat.,It looks like BTE did it again! They put their minds to work and came out with another great CD. The first time I heard the song AT THE STARS it became my favorite song.
5,building on dreams,"This is by far their best work to date. I got introduced to this album when I heard the song ""At the Stars"", which was constantly being played on the radio where I live. It was your typical pop acoustic song. I figured I'd buy the album. And, I have never been without it since. This is one of the cds that I own that is constantly being played in my car. I believe that they achieved complete maturity with this album when I compare it to past efforts. It is true that all of their albums had different feels to them... but I think ""Garden"" reached the apex of their talents so far. This album touches on every emotional level. Lyrically and musically it will let you step out of your life, and let you step back in again. The use of the Electronic sounds is just incredible. GET THIS ALBUM! and take my word for it... See them live!!"
3,Hmmm..... Better check out Deluxe first,"I bought this CD after being a huge fan of Deluxe (four stars) for 4 years, but this one didn't really impress me. The only truly good pop song (ewwwww) is Alison Foley, which I STILL have stuck in my head. One More Murder is cool, and the First one... (?)... is 'interesting'. Good album, but as some one else said.... ""Not the BTE I know!"""
3,an ok cd,"I bought this cd mostly because I'd heard about them and I was curious, plus I'd heard a few samples that sounded good. I was somewhat disappointed because a lot of the songs are really slow, though. My favorites are Like It Like That and Happy Day MaMa. Not a bad cd overall, if I could I would've given it 3 1/2."
