2,Eh- not that great,"The book was not bad at all, but the story sucked! I have never read a book with such a slow and boring story line. I am in grade nine and read every kind of book, but this one was a terrible disappointment after all of the good reviews!"
3,"OK for the price, but very light weight","I only use this bokken for practicing at home by myself, so it doesn't matter how it stands up against harder woods. It seems rather well made for the price, but I do have one complaint: it's about half the weight of bokkens we use in aikido at the dojo I practice at. Part of the point (for me) to practice at home was to increase my forearm and grip strength. I would say it is better to find a store where you can try one out first, or if you are a member of a dojo, order it through them (unless it's too expensive). Overall though, this isn't bad and will probably suffice for a while."
4,Cool,"I only bought this to give me something to do on my work vacation. I'll just be straight. I bought this to go out in the woods and hit trees with. Sounds strange, but it's so much fun. The bokken was not as sturdy as I thought it might be, I've worked with real oak before and this seemed a bit weaker. We'll see how long it takes for me to break it on my vacation."
3,Great for the money,"I purchased this bokken for an Aikido class. The tsuba (handguard) is mostly useless as it never stays in place, but otherwise it is a very good bokken for the money. The finish is smooth and the color is very nice. I have been using it for the past 6 months and so far no issues."
3,crane machine,I recently won a necklace in a box that looked just like this one.. in a crane machine. I had the same issue with the chain.. I have a feeling this is the same type of necklace.
1,"Makes your neck green, and the finish wears off!","Don't buy this piece of junk, yes it looks nice but after she wears it a couple times the cheap silver finish will come off and then make her neck turn green! Wow, what a gift! Do her a favor and save for something better or get her nothing cause this is just a waist of money."
1,Mother's Day,"I ordered this for my mom to be delivered before Mother's Day, which it was promised. While the reviews were good, it did NOT arrive in time and I am still waiting for delivery. It is not only disappointing but it is embarrassing. My mom deserves better."
5,Mom necklace,My daughter absolutely loves this necklace. She is a new mother. I wanted to get her something special from her newborn son.
5,Beautiful,"This necklace was really pretty! It looked pretty online, but when it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at it's quality and how eye catching it is. The box it came in really enhanced it since I was giving it to my Mom for Christmas. I would definitely recommend this one!"
3,Looks good,"It is kind of expensive for its quality.For less money I bought this and liked it more:""Mother I Cherish You"" Heartwarming 8x10 Qoutes/poem, Double-matted in Ruby Red/white and Enhanced with Flower Artwork."
3,Cheap chain,"I got this from my son for Christmas. I did love how it looked and the message that went along with it. The message did make me tear up too. However, now I must go out and buy an new chain for it because I would rather do that then go through the hassel of exchanging it."
4,Mom Forever Necklace,"Very nice item. Although the price is cheap, the necklace looks to be from a fine jewelry store. Highly RecommendMOM Forever Crystal Infinity Circle Necklace - Gift Boxed"
5,Mom really like it :),"My mom really like it, and the necklace looks really good in this great gift box.hmmm maybe the chain must be some more longer but it is ok as it."
3,Great gift for any budget!,I purchased this necklace for my mother-in-law for christmas and she seemed to really like it. I don't think the necklace looks cheap like the price but the box is kind of cheesy...
3,MOM forever,I loved the necklace but after having it for just a couple weeks the color started coming off! It looks dull in color now.
4,Great gift,"My mom really likes this necklace and it's very pretty, but the chain it comes on snags. I've caught her struggling to fix her necklace several times. The pendant clings to the necklace a will wind up on her collar bone. She has to slowly pull it back down over the chain to center it. It really needs a better chain. But the pendant is nice."
4,Bling Bling!,Fast shipping and the item is beautiful. You can't beat the price for this MOM Forever Crystal Infinity Circle Necklace - Gift Boxed.
3,lacks many chorus parts.,"It would be fine, except that there are many discrepancies between this score and what is in the chorus book."
5,GREASE IS STILL THE WORD,"GREASE IS THE ULTIMATE ROCK AND ROLL MUSICAL.A GREAT SHOW FOR TEENS,ESPECAILLY,EITH SONGS SUCH AS GREASED LIGHTNING AND MANY OTHERS.JOIN IN ON THE SUCCESS OF THIS GREAT MUSICAL AND LET GREASE STILL BE THE WORD."
3,A little flimsy,This stand does the job but is a little flimsy. It has a tendancy to wobble when one brushes off the grate so have to be careful not to upset it. I have a Weber go anywhere grill and the legs fall thru the top of the stand unless I sit it on sideways. Might be a little overpriced too. But could not find one better.
2,camp stove table,"I liked the compactness of this table because I can carry it in my RV without taking up much room, but this product at least the one I received was beyond flimsy. Two of the rungs on the lower section completely fell off the first time I used it. What kind of welding job is this? It sure wasn't the same kind of welding job as on the one the reviewer said she had owned for ten years. Amazon is making good on it by sending me another. I hope someone else manufactured it."
3,Wobbles easy,"Wobbles easy, wasn't silver like I thought from the pic, it's black instead which is ugly for indoors, but ok for outdoors. Personally I hate it but no better alternatives for this price that I know of."
1,Unreadable garbage,"The systems presented may have some merit, but they provide very little historical data to back them up. Anybody considering using these ""TD"" methods are urged to back-test them before applying them. After testing the methods myself on historical OEX options data, I am not yet fully convinced that they contribute much to the field of trading.Aside from the content, the level of writing is at 5th grade level at best. The authors simply can't write. This was the most unreadable piece of garbage I've ever had the misfortune to read. The whole book could be condensed to a 12 page brochure and still not miss a single topic. The other 330 pages are just worthless filler which add no value to the subject.This book is a complete waste of paper and natural resources. I could post all the methods on the internet and you would not even have to scroll the screen down to catch every topic covered in this sad excuse for a book."
5,The author is a market genius!,"Prior to xmas and on my birthday I received a copy of DeMark's 'New Science of Technical Analysis'. I have been a professional trader for over 20 years and currently head up the trading operation at one of the major Wall Street firms. I thought I knew how market operateed and I shared my expereince on TV, radio, and in newspapers for years. Upon reading this book and as well ass the other two in the DeMark set, I have gained a profound new awareness how markets truly behave. The author is beyoind peer in defining and describing the intricacies of price behavior. What an enlightening series of reads."
2,"some good ideas, but do they work??",This book could have been easily cut in half by assuming that the reader is intelligent enough to know that the sell side is the reverse of how the buy side setups etc works. Everything gets repeated this way and it is very annoying to have to skip ahead to the next piece of valuable information. It looks like their may be some good ideas presented but everything is described in a very long winded way and it is lacking in proof. I do not recall any charts in the book presenting failure and I'd be shocked if the methods are 100%. My guess is that there is some heavy optimization going on when applying these techniques.
1,Don't waste your time,Please don't waste your time by reading this book. If you've money to burn then burn it but don't burn it by buying this book
1,A bunch of gobblygook,"A terrible book with dubious methods based on dubious assumptions. It is a complete waste of money. I write this to caution readers as there are many books out there on day trading but many are bad, like this one. It is also not well written. If you don't believe me, then please go out and buy this book."
4,A difficult read. Be prepared to refer to the book often.,"The first few chapters are basic if one has traded options before. Latter on one gets an education in technical analysis the DeMark way. Since all the indaicators are entitled TD (Tom DeMark) this and TD that. In any event, it is a difficult read that forces one to reread a subject before comfortabling moving on to the intoduction of a new TD indicator. I did learn a tremendous amount and will begin to look at charts differently. My only criticism to the authors is to get to the point. When you are introducing an indicator, just tell me what it is and why. Don't give it a 5 paragragh build up. Don't boast about it. Here is what it is and what it does, and why you need to know it. Period."
1,Not worth a Read,Nothing here that will help you trade the market more effectively.A zero star book.The book attempts UNSUCCESSFULLY to cash in on day trading's current popularity.
3,"Good book, but...","...very technical. Written for experienced option traders only. Before diving into this book, make sure you have a solid foundation in trading options. We've been trading options (with varying degrees of success) for about a year and my husband and I are both stuck about 1/2 way through this book. We're constantly having to refer to other books to try to understand what the DeMark's are talking about and I don't see how the information ties together. Hopefully, we'll eventually get to that point, but for now this book isn't doing much more than collecting dust on the shelf. A friend of ours (who has more experience than we do in trading) swears by it. He gave us the names of a few other books that he recommends we buy & read before diving back into this book."
1,Lousy,"Don't waste your money on this is book, there might be 5 pages that are worth reading past that its all filler."
1,How else could TD call his son?,TD strikes again. The only one cashing in on Day Trading is TD. Don't expect this book to be of any help.
1,Mavala double lash,I do not recommend this item - I used it for more than 4 months and it did not work.
5,just amazing,"This is a must book, just amazing, in this, I find out the information of the basics for understanding better and to carry on in hydroponics, you can read it with pleasure an enjoy each page of it, and the most important the reading is so easy and along with the drawings make more undertanding the knowledge."
3,You might get it in time for next winter...,"I give this cover 3 stars for looks, although further investigation at other web sites shows that it's a vinyl cover, and not canvas as the picture above suggests. I can't review the cover itself because I never received it. The order page says it will ship in 3 to 5 weeks. However, my mom ordered this item as a gift for me in December 2003, and it has been repeatedly delayed. I just had her cancel the order, 3.5 months after it was placed, because I was tired of waiting. I plan to go to the local grill store instead."
4,"Part Astronomy, Part Cosmology with a dash of Stonehenge","Sun, Moon and Earth by Robin Heath is a short introduction to understanding the relation between the three celestial bodies in the title. The astronomy and geometry are written for a layman's level, without being too dry or technical, but not childish either. Heath details how the earth moves about the sun, with seasons and the calendar, as well as two types of lunar cycles, equinoxes, solstices, eclipses, etc. The book details how our calendar works and offers some interesting alternatives. There's even a short chapter about Stonehenge, which can be further explored in another volume by the same publisher.I found it fascinating how much megalithic astronomers knew about the sun and moon cycles, especially the geometry, but then again, they didn't have much else to do and light pollution was almost non-existent then. Imagine what the sky looked like in 3000 BC! The book is full of cool illustrations and tables and overall is well put together."
3,Form over substance,"I really wanted to like this book. It's a beautiful object in its own humble way. The drawings have a very nice classic feel about them. All the books in this series are 64 pages in length with each page dedicated to a brief summary of the concept being presented. The problem is that some of the concepts don't easily fit into such rigid parameters. There's some valuable information here but it's presented in such a cursory way that most readers will walk away feeling frustrated that they're missing a lot.On a positive note, perhaps this book will serve as an appetizer that will lead readers to search for other books that provide a fuller understanding."
4,excellant,A great film for the water skier. Somewhat documentary but stll a great way to cross the USA
3,"Interesting, but not one of the great ELO albums","I am glad that this CD is out. I remember how badly this album was slammed when it came out. I know in reading comments by Jeff Lynne over the years that this album was pretty much an ""end the contract"" type of album that he needed to do when he wanted to cease recording as ELO.It's not nearly as bad as the critics reviewed it at the time. While I wouldn't recommend it to someone as an introduction to ELO's catalogue, I think every ELO fan should have it.I wonder about some of the ratings I see here. If this is a five star album, what is ""ELDORADO"",""OUT OF THE BLUE"" or ""DISCOVERY"". I would rate those ELO albums as five star albums. If those are five's, I can only give this album a three."
1,stop believing in jeff,elo being mostly 70s dynamic people time secret messages &armchair theatre solo are the only worthwhile stuff power turns empty once you pass the so serious track
3,ELO - Down But Not Out,"""Balance of Power"" would be ELO's last album with producer/lead vocalist/songwriter Jeff Lynne, and the band sounds tired. It's quite a decline from the snappiness of their previous 1983 effort ""Secret Messages."" The opening keyboard riff of ""Secret Lives"" is frighteningly close to Christopher Cross' ""All Right."" ""Getting To The Point"" is a rewrite of ""Don't Walk Away"" from the ""Xanadu"" soundtrack while ""Calling America"" copies the theme of ""Telephone Line."" The band still has some spark left, though. ""Calling"" and ""So Serious"" continue the band's knack for upbeat hooks, while the arrangement of ""Without Someone"" effectively illustrates the glum, overcast mood of its singer."
1,Wonderful remaster???,Everybody's reviewing how glad they are with this remaster including the bonus-tracks. Only one writes that it is a wonderful remaster but I don't agree at all! This is a remaster in the worst case. I couldn't believe my ears when the sound comes to a climax (the loudest parts) it's all distortion for example with the Heaven only knows track. I thought I had a bad example. I played it on several CD-players with several and high-end equipments too but I can't deny Joseph M. Palmaccio (who-ever that may be) has some problems with his ears during the mastering or there weren't better tapes in store! By the way in the booklets that come with all of the remasters is written that the tracks are mastered and not that they are remastered. It's a pity!
3,Still One Of The Best ELO CD (Monkees886@aol.com),"This is the Last ELO cd. Sad to say but true. But this cd has left some good tunes for everyone to enjoy. The nice thing about it, Its Remastered."
3,EL-Oh...,"Not the greatest album they did, I read others reviews of this and hoped it would be a great on, I have listened to it a few times and find it not to be on my list for the futute fave category."
3,disco influence apparent,"If I was hearing this music on the radio, I would never have guessed it was ELO. It sounds just like all the other music around. Only in the track, Calling America, can you hear remnants of the instrumental arias for which ELO is famous. Nevertheless, this is good listening music and better than a lot of stuff around. I own the album and I listen to it. My standard of excellence is this -- how does it sound in the car while I battling expressway traffic? ELO is my favorite group on the way home from work. Their greatest hits is a MUST, cranked to the max. On a scale of Monday to Friday drive home, ELO's greatest hits is a TGI Friday album. Balance of Power is a Monday go-to-work drive album."
4,Don't knock it Just Because it was the 80's,"The tendency is for people to knock albums just because it was the 80's. It's very trendy and politically correct to knock the 80's just because it was the 80's..This album has superbly crafted pop/rock songs. The single, ""calling america"", was actually one of the weaker songs in my opinion, and with it being the single I believe it damaged some the chances of the album being a ""hit"".Interesting title though. Jeff Lynne definitely is a control freak. I think it's best when he writes and has other musicians help fill things out. On the last album ""zoom"", he played almost everything and it felt a little stale.With ""balance of power"", it doesn't feel stale. It feels like ELO."
2,The Power Is Not Well Balanced Here,"A short-played album which will be re-issued with bonus tracks, the B-sides ""Caught In A Trap"" and ""A Matter Of Fact"", in the near future. While the album has some high points, this is a somewhat tired Lynne. It's just too much synthesizers here.""Calling America"" and ""So Serious"" were two fine singles. The ballad ""Getting To The Point"" marked the end of a group. Otherwise this is just average songs. ""Heaven Only Knows"" starts fine but get's tiresome. ""Secret Lives"" has the typical Lynne riff in the refrain, but is really a bad song. ""Sorrow About To Fall"" adds a saxophone that makes it more forgettable. ""Endless Lies"" is Lynne trying to be Roy Orbison, which he's not! It's ordinary 80s synth pop with a trio that doesn't impress anyone. A sad farewell to an era. I'd give it 2.5 points."
1,The last and the least,"""Balance of Power"" was the last real ELO album (not counting drummer Bev Bevan's subsequent ""ELO II"" farce). As such, it was apparent that the time had come for leader Jeff Lynne to fold up the band which he thoroughly dominated by that point anyway. ""Calling America"" is a good single, but it is the only cut on the album worth hearing. In any event, the song is also available on the superior anthology album, ""Strange Magic: The Best of ELO,"" which would be a far better use for your money."
3,cheap but you get what you paid for,"A few oddities to point out.1. Choji oil/clove oil, which is what you typically get with sword cleaning kits, is colorless. The oil that comes with this kit is yellow/light orange, same color as vegetable oil. No idea what it's made from.2. The plastic little jar that holds oil paper/cloth, which you typically get with kits like these, is shown in the picture but not in the actual kit, nor was it mentioned in description.3. It does come with 2 bamboo peg (mekugi)This is a relatively cheap cleaning kit and the quality shows."
1,OIl Bottle opened and spilled internal,I thought this was different then the one I ordered earlier. The one I ordered prior to this was damaged due to the oil bottle opening and spilling inside the box. This was the exact same kit and the exact same thing happened. Open the box and check prior to selling to your customers!! This is a problematic issue that has been going on for 2 years!!!
1,oil spilt when i ordered it,"I ordered this product awhile ago but i decided to review it now, and let people know that the oil was spilled throughout the whole kit. I was really disappointed when I got it. This has also happened to some other customers reading the reviews. Your better off getting a sword cleaning kit from [...] to be honest (No intention of advertisement)"
3,the kit is not the same as picture,"the kit is not the same as picture ,if you want something white , asked before buyingand no bamboo mekugi peg"
5,Not a fan of the cover...but the recording is GREAT!,"Tony Bennett is a great crooner, no doubt. The cover leaves something to be desired. Tony is what crooner Brian Evans is...a young crooner even today. He's still got it. The two are very much the same!"
5,Fantastic first novel,"A first novel that makes you glad, Dale Cramer decided to write fiction. A story packed with strong southern characters, a fascinating story line, and description that puts you right in the town of Sutter's Cross. An absolute must read."
3,Hard to get into,"While I have greatly enjoyed his other books, I had a hard time letting this book take a hold of me. However, once I struggled through the first third of the book I was hooked. It is definitely worth the read and the ending is great!"
5,Sutter's Cross,I've fallen in love with Dale Cramer's writing. Picked up Levi's Will on a whim off the library shelf and now I'm hooked. Was so happy to find a good clean copy of Sutter'sCross. It came in excellent condition. I was very happy with it and the seller.
3,Fun but easy to do,I got this for my 4 year old brother and he has done one like this before and this one was really easy! no matter where you dig you find something so it really wasn't that fun for him. It says ages 8 I believe but I think anyone older than that would be bored if my little brother was.the I DIG sets are awesome and they're usually things that can keep going for a few days.
1,Short that's all it had going for it,"To be fair I had a book report due for a real estate course, and I was already burried in other finals and work. So I chose this book specifically for its length as I knew I could read it and knock out the report in a few hours.If your situation is similar, its great. But if you're actually expecting to gain something from this book, don't waste your time.The book is 30 some odd pages comprised of a 1 page title page for each chapter and a page of text per chapter. So yes this book is roughly 15 pages long. It covers some ideas for personal growth and guides you to essentially think outside the box. Don't limit yourself. So it covers a what, but doesn't really say anything about a how.The feel is more like a brochure where they're trying to bait you into a bigger program and don't detail the how cause they want more money before they give the secrets away. Think sleazy time share or infomercial"
1,Disappointed,"I was very impressed with Pritchett's book ""The Employee Handbook of New Work Habits for a Radically Changing World"" so I purchased this one. I didn't find it worthwhile. It seemed like it was simply a few pages of advice like take more chances which had no value."
4,Awesome read!,"This is a great awe-inspiring book. Very quick to read and very to the point.It encourages you to do look at the many things you do, review them, and take another stance with different action points. You will look at the same problem or issue that you have but with brighter eyes and a clearer focus. The energy needed to make a quantum leap, that can propel you limitlessly is inside all of us. Like everything, it is all about making that first leap. I will be recommending this book to many people who I know who are on the borders of a quantum leap, but just need that final push."
1,Repetitive and boring,"This has got to be one of the worst Buddha Bar's. There are maybe two songs that differ from the rest. If you listen to one piece, you've listened to them all. This is about as original and interesting as elevator music. That god I got it for free at my public library. Needless to say, I didn't burn a single piece."
4,Typical Lawhead,"I was disappointed in Lawhead's attempt to ""reform"" Pelagius. While it is true that all we know about his teaching comes from his enemies, his enemies were people like Saint Augustine so.... At any rate, history seems to teach that Patrick was not Pelagian. Nevertheless I greatly enjoyed the book. Patrick emerges as a real person and not a stick-figure ""saint"", but I wish his Christianity was a little more evident in the story. There is no real conversion experience. Lawhead made us believe he was building up to one. But the very end is typical Lawhead and very satisfying. I recommend the book highly."
2,departure from the expected,"I've read most of Lawhead's books, and while I was totally bowled over by Byzantium, this book left me wondering if a geographic change of domicile for him has influenced his writing.I finished this book only because I appreciate the way he plies his craft. The first 150 pages of the book are the hardest to get through: while being very realistic and probably appealing to the general public; I feel that the believer who begins to read this book will stop before the point of the story has been made due to being offended with the ""in your face"" details of the baseness of humanity.I do agree with other reviewers that this book has all the marks of being the first of a series, simply because the book ends with a beginning and does not complete the story of Patrick's life. It was not his best."
3,somewhat tedious,"This book is somewhat of an oddity. You certainly can't take this as a historical read, nor can you dismiss the history involved. The book is fun to read though, well plotted, although his constant tries to escape will make any reader feel like they're doing something tedious. It does capture the church's faults and the horrors of slavery and love, but in the end it feels like the novel ends and begins a new book????If you don't look at this book as a historical novel (mostly historical, that is) and have a strong stomach, it is a good read."
4,"starts out slow, but winds up to be a memorable book.","As a longtime Lawhead fan, I've read everything he's put out for the last decade or so. This book, while not utterly engaging, sets the groundwork for the sequel to come. The book starts out slow, with Lawhead writing like the groundwork is always the most painful part for him. After the initial first third of the book, he starts to write as though he's genuinely interested and we, as readers, are swept away as well. There is violence and some sex in the book, but I believe it is justified in light of what will come next. Often it's hard to see why a transformation takes place in someone's life unless you've seen and experienced everything. Here the world shows Patrick what it has to provide: wealth, slavery, sex, religious standing, military fame, and social standing. Ultimately, for Patrick, it is worthless if a life is not led by God. He follows God's leading and begins to find his place once again. I can't wait for the sequel!"
3,Good... but not historically correct,"I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Byzantium and the Pendragon Cycle and was looking forward to reading Patrick. However after reading the book I have mixed feelings. It is a good story, with the same page turning pace that we are used to with Lawhead, but like many of the other reviewers here I have to say it is a lot more fantasy than history. The main sources of Patrick's life are his Confession and his letter to Croticus followed several centuries later by Muirchu's Vita. While Lawhead picks several of the historical facts and builds his story around these there are many other elements of the story which are HIGHLY improbable. The likelihood of 2 marriages and this being the driving force in Patrick's life does not square with his conversion story in his own Vita - nevertheless if you want an easy vacation read go for it."
4,Not Great History but an Enjoyable Tale,"This is another good work from Stephen Lawhead, in which he uses his usual blend of history and myth to spin an engaging tale of one of Ireland's patron saints. Lawhead's feeling for the period, and his love of all things Celtic shines through as strongly as his usual redemptive Christian message. However he departs a long way from what we know of the historical Patrick. Don't mistake that for a lack of research though. He is well read in the extant literature on St Patrick - he just chooses to spin his tale in a direction that the literature does not always lead.As long as you don't use this as a historical source book, there is much to enjoy in this story. My only criticism is that, having read quite a lot of Lawhead this year, I am beginning to find the formula for his books somewhat rehearsed. Not totally though - this is still a fine read."
2,"Good Fiction, Terrible Biography","Simply as a fictional novel, this work by Lawhead is an excellent read. BUT as a biography, it's a false account of Patrick's life.ReadSt. Patrick of Ireland: A Biographyby Phillip Freeman, which has good translations of St. Patrick's surviving letters. Read Patrick's known, fascinating writings and compare them to Stephen Lawhead's Patrick: Son of Ireland. Lawhead hugely diverges from many of the known facts of Patrick's life."
4,A Good Read,"This was a very well written story. I have read a great deal about Celtic life and history in the last few years, and this book appeared well researched. The action was constant, the character development was excellent, and the settings were beautifully and richly detailed. There was more sex than I am usually comfortable with, but it was not raunchy or offensive, so it did not destroy my enjoyment of the story. All in all, a very good read!"
2,Not really a Saint,"I have read the reviews about how troubling this book can be, and I concur. As long as you forget about St. Patrick, and just consider it a story about some guy, it is well-written and interesting after a fashion. If you want Christian inspiration, look elsewhere. I'm one of Lawhead's biggest fans, but I don't have much good to say about this one. I recommend you buy something else."
1,really bad,i dont know a lot about computers but needed 2 mor gigs of ramm looked up my computer and specs ordered 2 of these got them put them in and my computer started beeping shut it down took them out and now my computer wont start up thanks alot amazon
3,Intriguing spy thriller,"Popular screenwriter Barry Levinson wrote this interesting spy tale where James Coburn plays an advisor to the president. He plans it so four associates who know of scandals in the president's past kill each other off, the twist being that the second last to die first plants poison for the last one. But, poison paper is the key to end Coburn himself. Obvious inferences to Nixon and Watergate are what sparked the film into production. The death scenes are at times gruesome, including a Hitchcock-style shower strangling and torture with loud noise."
4,"A good read, but hard to understand medical lingo","Fisher writes an excellent medical thriller, but her knowledge of medicine and virology sometimes leaves the reader trying to guess the plot. The action is fast-paced and the characters are believable. If you can get around all the jargon, you will definitely enjoy the book. A MUST READ for fans of Robin Cook!"
4,A good book,This book teaches you that you can be friends with people even if they speak another language. I've read every Kirsten book and this is one of the best!
3,Not as pictured,Just wish the photos match what arrived. Much shorter & fatter then the picture shows.
2,A little disappointed...,"I like this flask, but have noticed that it's been taking a bit more effort to screw the cap on. It's as if the threads aren't true."
1,Wrong picture !!,"I bought one of these, and thinking it was such a great deal, orders 10 more before the first one came...big mistake. The item pictured is for a slim flask, narrow and tall. What I got was short and wide, like an 8oz flask with the bottom half cut off...very disappointing."
4,Small and handy,"Small hip flask that fits into my slim jeans back pocket. No leaking, no squeaking, it just works fine. If you don't have funnel you need to buy it separately."
3,LEAKED!! but see my update...,"I was pleased with the size, appearance and feel of these flasks (I ordered two) when I received them. However, when I filled them with water to check them out they both leaked. One leaked due to a small seam split on the bottom corner and the second leaked where the filler neck joins to the flask body. Both defects are due to poor construction/workmanship. Back to Amazon they go...UPDATE: Okay, I decided to give this flask another shot and ordered two more from Amazon. The size and style are what I'm looking for and I couldn't find any other options I liked on Amazon. When they arrived the first thing I did was perform a leak test and was pleasantly surprised that both past the test! We'll see how they do over time but for now they are keepers. I've added back two stars on the rating (for now...)."
4,"Cute, but not perfect","This 4oz flask is a perfect size to fit unobtrusively in a man's coat or jacket. This flask arrived quickly and looks great - the finish is very attractive. The lid is nice as well, but the arm that attached the lid to the flask body looks cheap and flimsy compared to the flas itself, which is a little disappointing. Otherwise the flask looks much more expensive than it is. Overall I would recommend it and believe it is a great value, but if you are looking for one as a gift, the cheap-looking arm might be a deterrant, depending on how observant the recipient is."
5,Great Gift!,I bought several flasks to give as gifts to my bridesmaids for my wedding... they are the perfect size! I love how light weight and durable they are! We are going to enjoy having them for sure ;)
2,You get what you pay for,"I knew this was a cheap flask and went into the purchase with open eyes but, you get what you pay for!Plus:+Good size - I like the capacity, curve and general dimensions+Sturdy - nice gauge steel+PriceNegative:-It leaks - the stopper in the cap is made out of some sort of hard plastic or vinyl that doesn't seal. Needless to say, bourbon leaking into your pocket is not a good feature.I'll try to find something that I can replace the seal with and get it to do the one job its made for. If I can get it to not leak I would give this product four stars but it loses two because I have to hack it to get it to work."
4,Good product,"Does not leak like another review said. It is a bit shorter and fatter than what is pictured though. Overall for the price, it's a good product."
3,review from the Synthesis,"All I can think about while listening to these guys is how much they appear to like At the Drive-In. Not that it's a badly done rip-off, but there are a lot of similarities; interesting guitar interaction, creative song structures and spastic energy. Even the vocals take on a Cedric Bixler-esque quality to them at times, with half-shouted/half sung lyrics. Their approach is definitely more measured, with less noise and ambience, and holds its own charm. They generally tend to cultivate a mid- to fast-tempo jaunt that lets the listener really pay attention to the songs without them dragging or impeding on the live-set feel of the album. It should be interesting to see what they do in the future.- Rob ReevesSynthesis.net"
1,waste of money,"Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story. WTF!!! Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!!!"
2,Didn't last 6 months,"This toaster has great features and looks good. We enjoyed it while it lasted, which unfortunately was less than 6 months. We will replace it with a Black and Decker."
3,Just OK,"The machine seems durable but it is quite large and takes up a lot of room. I like the easy cleaning feature where the bottom crumb trays slide out. However, it doesn't seem to toast the bread evenly on both sides.My last four slice toaster was longer and more rectangular - two slices of bread could be put in together, which meant that really long slices could be toasted. So I miss that feature. A really long slice of bread has to be cut in half to fit in this toaster.I wouldn't buy this particular toaster again."
2,Half Baked,"The only reason this didn't get only one star is that it barely works as opposed to being a complete dud. Half the toasting elements work properly which means it's necessary to turn whatever your toasting to get an even result. Half a turn on the timing knob-which lacks any calibration-produces a half baked effort to time things. When you look at the slots, and then try and insert something, you find it only accepts things half as big as one would expect. The cord is half as long as needs be. But it looks great on the counter but it's a half baked idea to buy it for the design only."
3,Not what I'd hoped for...,"I love the big wide slots for toasting bread, bagels or sliced rolls, however the toaster lever has a problem ""clicking"" down. Once it's down, it stays down and works, however getting down is a different issue."
3,"4 slots is nice, but it burns toast","Bought this as a gift for my mom. It's great to have 4 slots, but even on medium it burns the toast. If you do buy it, just be aware!"
3,"Not bad for the price, but definitely NOT cool-touch","We have been on a seemingly endless quest for find a good toaster, since we are a very toast intensive household. However, no toaster has lasted longer than 18-24 months before flaking out on us, including some of the higher-end models. So, when ourKitchenAid KMTT400SS 4-Slice Metal Toasterstopped holding down the toast on one side, we threw it out and decided to opt for a cheaper alternative for the time being.Well, that's what this Sunbeam toaster is, a cheap toaster. It works, it toasts, reasonably quickly and evenly so far. It's listed as being ""cool touch"", but the outside gets very hot. We'll use this one until it breaks then start again."
4,Great,"My grandson has a great time playing with Big Jake,along with Jay Jay and Tracy. I didn't realize the propellors moved until I received it. The face and details of the plane are very good. Thank you for sending it quickly and he is enjoying it."
2,"An older, tired R.E.M.","Maybe it's possible that I'm just not as big of an R.E.M fan as I thought because I thought this was a very boring concert. The song selection is terrible. If there was a slow boring song on any of their albums, then they surely played it on here. I own the R.E.M. Road Movie DVD and I think the song selection on that DVD was way better (even though the quality of the DVD is worse) Other than the boring songs, once again I think the mix is off on this DVD. The music is over the singer, and you might as well forget the back up singer, you cant even hear him. Just listen to ""orange crush"". The singer is also off key in the beginning of the DVD. The DVD lacks energy, as well as the band. What your left with is a more older, burnout, tired R.E.M. The DVD footage is amazing, the scenery and quality is the best aspect of the DVD. Final verdict: Great picture, muffle sound, drowned out vocals, unenthusiastic band, great scenery"
2,I was fooled...,"I was expecting this DVD to be in DTS, but unfortunately it was only in Dolby Digital 5.1 format.I'm so disappointed."
3,Mixed feelings,"The performance is five stars, the song selection is five stars (even without Radio Free Europe). The color on this looks incredible on my hdtv and sounds pretty good on the surround. So why three stars? The camera work. I swear they show every face in the crowd lipsyncing. They also flash around and can bring on a case of vertigo. This is a GREAT dvd to keep on in the background, but to me is very irritating to watch because of the camera work. Stipe gives a great performance."
5,Best R.E.M. Concert Film Yet!,"After seeing R.E.M. in Detroit last Fall, I was determined to purchase this DVD the day it came out. After my initial viewing my high expectations were exceeded! Tourfilm and Road Movie are both excellent films, but this one surpasses them both. The Wiesbaden outdoor setting is beautifully filmed, and the sound is incredible. The song selection provides many highlights, although I wish they had played ""Driver 8"" in this show, as it does not appear on any of their earlier live films. Maybe next time! I would recommend this DVD to both the veteran fans and folks who are new to R.E.M. I saw them in three times in the mid-1980's, and I can certainly say that the band has lost none of its passion over the years. They certainly put on a great show for the enthusiastic fans in Germany. Hopefully, this DVD will spark renewed interest in R.E.M. in the U.S."
5,Awesome Concert,"I've watched this concert many times now and it gets better every time. Well worth twice the price, its my personal favorite concert dvd. Set in a beautiful outdoor park in Weisbaden, Germany, REM with Michael Stipe performs all their hits and some new that are a bonus. For example, So Fast, So Numb.. an incredible gem which I had not heard before has now become a favorite. This concert dvd is a treat for both sight and sound. My only complaint is I wish I had been there. Buy it.. you will soon thank me."
3,Great Set List - Terrible Camera Work!,"Incredible range of hits from early stuff all the way to the most recent albums. My complaint is the camera work! The shot is constantly changing, never on a subject for more than 3-4 seconds. Not enought Stipe and too many random fan shots. Great music, terrible camera work."
3,IPod charger,"This inexpensive package offers 3 chargers: the USB and automotive chargers work fine but the 110V adaptor was rudely rejected by my IPod, saying it wasn't compatible and would not let it charge the unit. I have a ITouch v. 2 that was supposed to be compatible with this charger. I didn't waste much money, I just have to find another make or probably pay a bunch and get one from Apple."
2,problems with ipod touch data transfers,"The charger worked for my ipod touch, but have had lots of errors and problems with data transfers. Had to erase ipod and start over and still won't work with new cord."
5,Guide to Wildflowers of SC,We purchased A Guide to Wildflowers of SC for the office - educational. It has been a very useful book.
5,Great Reference Material,"Being in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, I find this book very useful and easy to use. I am really glad to have it. I use to determine what kinds of weeds, wildflowers and trees I have. It also helps me determine what the DNR and DHEC might consider marsh and wetlands."
2,Really really hoped this would work,"Last summer I spent more time than I care to think about wondering what was causing my zucchini plants to die from the bottom up, and picking caterpillars off my kale and collards. I wasn't really interested in repeating either experience, so I was thrilled to find this.I've been applying regularly, re-applying after rain (not that we've had any) and watering, and....watching my kale getting eaten by caterpillars. Those little green ones that are supposed to be easily killed with BT. But I guess not with this. Even spraying it directly on them doesn't seem to have an effect.As for the zucchini, I'm not really sure what's going on. It doesn't appear to have that stem worm thing, or at least I can't find an entry slit, but it's definitely not doing well. This may not be the spray's fault, but having seen no evidence that this is improving anything, I'm afraid I won't be spending any money on it. :-("
1,No improvement on my hibiscus moscheutos,"I rarely use chemicals or pesticides in the garden but had the opportunity to give this product a try. I have a perennial Rose Mallow (hibiscus moscheutos) whose leaves get devoured yearly by the caterpillar of the sawfly. I've tried handpicking, but they just keep coming. I used this product specifically for the leaf eating caterpillars it says it controls. It did not. After one weeks use, there were still caterpillars eating the sprayed leaves, the few I chose to spray daily."
3,I Couldn't Tell Much of a Difference,"Our biggest problem is snails on canna and agapanthus, and this actually does deter them a bit, but you have to coat both sides of all the leaves, frequently if you have showers. However, Safer Brand isn't really meant to deter snails, so it's not surprising that it didn't stop the snails.This does seem to work on regular buggy pests that I had on a couple outdoor flowers. However, per the directions, you have to coat both sides of the leaves fully. In short, one spray container of this doesn't last that long when you have to use it heavily on a bunch of plants. Consequently, I think this might be a better bet for inside plants with the occasional pest, rather than outside plants under constant attack."
5,"A Great Garden ""Tool""","Okay, it is still the month of June in the Northeast where everything grows more slowly, but I simply must write some praises for Safer's 5452 3-in-1 Garden Spray. Safer's is a name I have always been able to trust for non-poisonous kinds of garden treatments. The real insect mating and leaf-eating days are still to come so I will add onto this review as needed.The first and most successful experience I've had with Safer's 5452 3-in-1 (one wishes they'd come up with a better name) is spraying flea beetles on an early emerging potato plant. The day the beetles started making holes in the leaves I sprayed and now no more little black beetles at all. I feel confident that whatever bugs or mildrews come along I will be able to cal on this great garden ""tool"" to come and get them."
2,Safer but does it work?,"I try to avoid introducing chemicals into my immediate environment. This means that I use organic fertilizer, that I compost and that I usually do not use commercial insecticides. Thus, I am disposed to like this organic product. I have tried it on several occasions: to control a caterpillar infestation on an ornamental tree; to control pests on a rose bush and to combat a fungicide on two shrubs. I cannot say that the results have been particularly commendable. I will continue using it over the next weeks and update this review, but for now I cannot recommend the product."
3,I didn't see a difference!,I sprayed this on all of my shrubbery and flowers and I really didn't see a difference in the growth or health of the shrubbery or flowers. I wouldn't purchase this product on my own.
2,"Hummm, What Am I Missing?","I thought I would try the Safer Brand on some of my rose bushes and a tree in the front yard that was exhibiting some fungal effects. I sprayed both the rose bushes and the tree at the same time. It's been almost 2 weeks and I haven't noticed even a minor change to the plants. I'm sure the product is safe, but how effective? I would at least expect to see a minor change after two weeks. It seems at this point the Safer Brand is not working nearly as well as the industrial ""poisons"" on the market. When there is disease or pests affecting your plants, trees, or shrubs, you want something that will work, first and foremost. At this point, I can't recommend the Safer Brand as the product of choice."
3,Works Well,"This product does what is says it will do. I like the fact that it is all natural. I try to buy organic, so why would I want to use pesticides on the food that I take the trouble to grow?All in all, I am satisfied with this product."
4,Kills bugs and clears up disease...it's supposed to,"Hard to get super excited over a product that seems to do what it advertises to do. Bugs die. Diseases and fungi disappear. That's what it is designed to do and it does it. So does almost every product like this one. If their claims are correct, it is nice to know there are less chemicals and poisons in this product, yet it is still effective. So, for a ""semi-green"" shotgun for garden ailments...this one fits the bill."
1,Didn't work and Didn't Spray,"I got the product to help with the white milky fungus which had spread to my cantaloupe and zucchini. I wanted something I could treat the slightly infected leaves with after I pruned all the infected ones.I cannot describe how frustrating the spraying mechanism was. It clogged every other spray. After 10 minutes of attempts 9and colorful language), I poured it into a different bottle and used a different sprayer. I used it for four days, then there was no more. AND It did not work. Don't waste your money on the product. Try another."
3,Product is Great,"Pretty safe and useful.Targets and kills aphids, beetles (Leaf-feeding), caterpillars (Leaf-feeding), crickets, earwigs, lace bugs, leafhoppers, mealybugs, mites, plant bugs, scale crawlers, thrips and whiteflies"
4,So far so good...,"A friend of mine gave me some strawberry plants for my garden this year. I discovered that they came with leaf rolling caterpillars. After killing a few, I sprayed the plants with this spray and I haven't seen any since. These caterpillars have 2 or 3 generations in a summer, so I would say that's a good sign."
4,Helpful for a Guy like me,"about a month ago I noticed that some of the plants in my backyard were developing spots on them. I had no clue what was causing the spots. Was it bugs, mold, maybe even a plant disease? I had no clue. Enter in the Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray. I followed the directions and hit my roses and infantile blue berry bush with this stuff hoping it would solve the problem and so far it has. I'm impressed. (mostly because now I don't have to checkout and read books on plant disease). This products great and took the guess work out of gardening for an amateur like me. Only if it would water and feed my plants too."
5,Seems to Work,"I have been using this product quite extensively in my garden. I have quite a mixture of plants and succulents and was hoping for an all purpose spray - which it appears to be. I don't have a severe pest problem, but do find the occasional need to be pro-active. So far, so good."
2,Disappointed.... not up to the standards of the brand,"I have used many Safer products before with success, and I was surprised to be disappointed with this one. I used it throughout the summer growing season on different plants to see what it would do. To be honest, it did not appear to do a thing. The little critters would just keep on moving right through it, and that is not my experience with safer's insecticidal soap and other products. I tried this, but then had to turn to my standards of Neem, Pyola, or Spinosad to do the job. I had a large aphid problem on some bok choy that this didn't touch but that the neem knocked right out. I have had such good experience with Safer's products in the past that it honestly makes me wonder if there is something wrong with the batch that filled my bottle."
1,Didn't Work,"Because it was billed as a safe and organic product, I first used Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray on some pesky flies on my indoor plants. While I realize that the product isn't really designed to kill the larva that are in the soil, it didn't even kill the flying adults - even when I sprayed them directly onto the bugs. I also used the product on the aphids that were eating my roses and again there was no affect. After going 0-2, and it wasn't for underuse - I repeatedly sprayed mass quantities on the bugs - I decided to throw the product away and invest in something that would actually kill garden pests.Safer, organic, or not, I see no reason to spend $13 on a product that doesn't work - and the Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray doesn't cut the mustard!"
2,"Kills most bugs, but.....","This stuff is just a little too weak for my taste. The bugs don't die even while you watch, most sprays have them running for their lives.Tried on cabbage worms on my brussels sprouts. Didn't even last 2 days when it didn't rain. And the cabbage worm barely noticed it, took him about 5 minutes to finally drop, I could've picked him off by hand and tossed in the trash can.So if you need ultimate safe spray, and you have the time to go out every other day or so, and spray directly on the bug, great. (but you could use watered down DISH SOAP and get the same results)I gave up and got Bug Be Gone. Yes I know it kills bees, but I never spray it close to any flowers.Also, I sprayed this on ants in my cantaloupes, and they kept right on walking like it was raining on them, or something??Fine for mild bug problems, but infestation? Forget it."
4,Works very well -- lasts about 3 weeks,"Worked very well against cabbage worms on broccoli, brussel sprouts and cabbage in southern NY in June 2011. Effect was visible within about 3-4 days, and overall lasted about 2-3 weeks without rain. I will definitely buy this again."
1,Don't buy used,Game was DOA and erased all the game info my son already had on his game. Did not work at all. Would never buy again
5,remarkable,"Donna Williams was diagnosed with autism as an adult, after many misdiagnosises. In her past, she faced child abuse, homelessness and prostitution. Now, that she began to realize her problems had a definite basis, she began to do something about them. Although her behavior was considered ""antisocial"" and eccentric, her insight into the human condition is remarkable. She has worked as a teacher of special needs children, and received awards for her ""do-goodness."" In this book, she casts aside the ""characters"" and poses that have made up her world, and begins to relate to people as herself, not as how she imagined they would want her to. Eventually, she began to publish memoir, which was picked up and published internationally. Her triumphs both in the professional and personal spheres will have you cheering, as she fights to master autism. ""I will not let it control me"" she writes, and she hasn't."
5,A Taste of The Teaching,"This documentary vividly shows Gurdjieff's struggles to introduce the teaching to the West from escaping the Russian revolution to working with his students resistances and ultimately taking the teaching to Europe and establishing the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man, then introducing the teaching to America. There is much feeling and depth of thought applied to this inquiry. It creates an opportunity to have a taste of the teaching."
2,Bad,"I LOVE Anne Shirley and that is the only reason I bought this DVD. I didn't expect it to be very good, but it is REALLY bad. Even Anne Shirley can't save it. The only highlight of the picture is Anne frisking a group of gangsters. If you are a big Anne Shirley fan, I recommend renting it from Netflix."
3,"Tedious, but great info","I read this book for a class and I am glad it was assigned because I learned so much from reading it. However, this is not a book I'd expect anyone to read for pleasure.The book is a social history of post-Reconstruction to about World War I. The author breaks down categories of everyday life -- housing, working, playing, etc. -- showing how much things changed during that 40-year period. And it is loaded with information. I learned that Americans used to buy houses from the Sears catalog; I learned of the origins of some of the more popular department stores and products of today, like Filene's and Post cereal; I learned about the early stages of the telephone and voice recorder. It was very educational.However, it reads like a textbook. There's no color here, just one fact after another. It serves its purpose as an informative book that provides background for a class on that era, but it's hardly the kind of book you take to the beach for a relaxing, smooth read."
2,Too Oily,"I ment to get the low fat Kettle Korn, but clicked on the wrong thing. This is too oily for me. Get the low fat one. It has all the taste you want & is only 100 calories."
1,Artificially Sweetened,This is sweetened with sucralose which is an artificial sweetener. No way am I giving this to my kids.
4,A lot of popcorn,"Let me tell you. Six boxes of kettle korn is mucho popcorn. I bought all this popcorn late at night a few months ago. I was not Above the Influence at the time. Hence (seemingly) infinity popcorn.I've made it through about half the boxes of popcorn. Thankfully, it's pretty good popcorn. Salt and sweet is always a fun combination.Would I buy 36 popcorn bags at once again? Probably not. Do I flat regret my purchase? No, it makes my girlfriend laugh when she brings it up. And we both love kettle korn."
5,In the Land of White Death,"A superb book! This first person narrative is an extremely well written page-turner. With unsurpassed realism, Albanov has captured his epic journey across the frozen Arctic. It is a gift to our generation that In the Land of White Death was translated from Russian and republished."
5,Ghost blues to haunt you.,"Charles Caldwell is the origin of a new style of blues, free, rock and arty. Raw music to scratch your skin till it bleeds...Charles Caldwell is dead and gone but his music make us feel alive.One of the best album of this new century."
2,Not a very good collection of plans,"We are going to hire an architect and contractor to build a home and bought 3 megabooks of plans from Amazon to get some ideas. This was the worst of the lot though by no means as awful as ""the house you build"" book. My wife and I just didn't like many of the plans. The organization isn't really too useful as the plans are grouped by style, not size (nobody who is building a 3000sf home wants to parse through 1500sf cottages). The color photos are nice and I gave the book 2 stars because there are helpful hints for construction and design interspersed throughout. Check my other reviews for the home books we recommend."
1,Ultimate?,Who can claim this is the ultimate book? Who is the editors of homeowner? I don't trust this book since I don't see an author's name attached. Authors are more credible even though editors make more.
2,Hunting Evil,"I would like to share with everyone my thoughts about this book. I think that Carlton Smith is a very lowsy writer. He never interviewed me or ""Charloette"". He never interviewed my mother or james either. I didn't even find out about this book until 3 months after it was published. I would like everyone to know that I feel that my rights were violated because in the 2nd paragraph on page 179, my real name was printed. Being that I am a minor at the age of 16, I do believe that is against the law.As far as accuracy, it was very accurate (the events where i was victimized) I also don't understand why this book was written before the trial. I am the daughter of Michelle Michaud and I know how ""Evil"" she really is. She goes beond the meaning of that word."
2,Could have been so much better...,"I was expecting more from this story, instead you get a lecture about crystal meth, alleged conversations and thoughts. No real details, long explanations of scenery & drug use. I felt like it was rushed and not investigated enough. I am a True Crime fan and read 2-3 books a month, and this was one of the worst."
2,Hunting Evil or is it the evil within?,"As carlton describes in the book, disfunction in a family can cause embedded scares to ones soul. As a child Jim needed help with many different issues. They were never addressed in the proper manner. His mother fixed, excused or blamed anyone except Jim or herself for the unthinkable things he did. A child is not born with these scares, they are put there by an evil adult. I should know, I'm the younger sister!"
4,Used MacBook Review,"I was overall happy with this purchase. The Mac Book's case seemed to be a little scuffed up too much for my expectation. The cost was 50 % less than a new machine, but at 50% less I still had higher expectations, especially for a machine that is several years old. So if the Mac Book last's, I'll be grateful and rate it an 8 out of 10.Respectfully Jurgen K. Beck"
4,Good computer,"I have had this computer for a couple of months and it is still working perfectly. When I first turned it on the ""3"" key wasn't working but after I restarted the computer it worked fine. One downside to this computer is that it comes with very old software on it (MAC OSX 10.5.8)."
4,"beautiful color, great price","I had never order a pashmina before, so I was not sure what to expect. When I opened my package, I was greatly relieved to discover that these pashminas were extactly the color depicted in the photos. They are beautiful. Since I've never really looked at pashminas before, I'm not sure what quality they should be. They are really thin and seem as though they would prick easily. I'm going to try to be careful with them. I brought five--four for my bridesmaids to wear at my wedding and one as a keepsake for myself. We all thought they were beautiful."
5,Basic concepts laid out well,"Great for a reference guide or a learning book for those new to the topic.Amazon wants more words here, so there ya go you b@stards. :)"
5,El mejor libro sobre cableado de redes,"Si Ud. esta pensando en el montaje de cableado de redes en forma profesional, entonces Ud. debe comprar este libro. En verdad explica todo acerca del cableado, desde las normas hasta estrategias a segir. Siempre lo ocupo como referencia para tomar decisiones acerca de la mejor opción a seguir!"
2,Not her best work,I bought her other book Tarot Spells many years ago and loved it. I figured that this might be a decent book because it was written by the same author but it was not. The book has the feel as though she had some ideas in her head about not taking thing to serious when it comes to doing magic and jotted it down on paper and called it a book. The book has more of a self help feel than a book on magic.
5,Angelic Voice: Smooth Operatic Tenor of Jerry Vale,"ANYONE who appreciates crooners...must have this album. Jerry Vale is the most underrated voice of the 20th Century. His style, quality, and tone are oh, so rich...as one reviewer said - he can charm the birds out of the trees.Also, Jerry Vale (Gennero Luigi Vitaliano) is distinct, unique, and special. ALL of these selections are excellent - ""Pretend You Don't See Her"" is the sine qua non.In the afterlife, I want to be in Jerry's corner of heaven and be blessed by that angelic voice."
2,vale aint bad!,"Don't recommend to me no more thank ya! I am a metal head! and proud of it baby. I live on van Halen Dream Theater and the Great IRON MAIDEN! recently i have been rocking out to Gotthard,Jorn,Axel Rudi Pell and Europe and there modern metal sound!"
2,Visco Memory foam,"the description and picture of the product are vague at best. we were not sure what we were getting. while the product is itself has no defects, the picture shows layers of foam which, come to find out, is really three different products. further the numbers which appear in the picture and description are not defined anywhere. we took the number to be a durability rating and we chose a higher number. in fact the number is a hardness rating and the pad is too hard for our needs. lastly the ""expandable cover"" is nothing to speak of. it is a piece of cloth that serves no real purpose except to get bunched up when put into use. it needs to enclose the entire pad to be effective."
5,Made a big difference to my back,"I bought this cover and I just love it. I had no odor problem with mine, if it had one, it was so mild and not a problem. I really notice waking in the morning to no backache so it was worth every penny. I would definatly buy another one with no hesitation."
3,Not as soft as expected,"First of all you have to know to let this mattress air out for quite a while before you put it on your bed - otherwise you contaminate you sheets and old mattress with a terrible smell. According to the customer service it is not toxic, just takes some time to disappear. Unfortunately I did not get the expected relief - my old mattress is very hard and I barely feel a difference even after adding this Foam Pad."
1,Poor quality foam,Feels like a regular piece of foam. I felt cheated. Nothing like the memory foam I expected.
2,A Need To Remember,"I am a Holocaust survivor and share my story with students who are to become either a bar or bas mitzvah. I have given ""A Pomise To Remember"" to many of my students at the conclusion of our one to one session. If nothing else, the book is a must have to endorse... NEVER, NEVER FORGET!"
2,Blah.,"I don't really know what to make of this particular book. The reading was pretty typical of any of the many skydiving books which are available. I get the sense that this book was never intended to be published. If publication was intended, it was certainly rushed. Almost all of the photos were printed so dark that you could not make out what the photos were. The hand drawn diagrams were pretty odd, and not all that understandable. The photos that were not printed too dark were too choppy with huge pixels (obviously taken from a home PC and blown up).The positive aspects of this book are that it touches on just about every aspect of skydiving. The book was also relatively inexpensive, although Amazon did not offer a discount. I wish I could be more positive about this book. There are better books available. I recommend the Skydivers Handbook. It is everything this book is times 2. Happy Skydiving!"
4,"Totally cute, but do you need it?","I purchased this Winnie da Pooh set and I LOVE IT. However, I returned this diaper stacker because I just don't need it. I can put my diapers in the chaging table drawer and save the money on this item. Plus, it looks a tad weird in the room."
5,My 2nd grade son says best board game ever,"My 2nd grade boy was so excited after school one day to tell me all about the game he played at school called Heximania. He said the teacher really likes it and all the students in his class liked it and had a lot of fun playing it. He said to be sure to follow the instructions, since that was the funnest way to play the game. He wants me to buy it immediately."
1,confusing,"This text is confusing, contains several errors and overall quite useless for the classroom setting."
5,Bravo! Another stellar performance!,"Paul continues to write solid books with true to life examples that only can only be the result of experience. Clear and concise chapters covering everything to general setup to plotting CD's! The best explanation of the Project Management (Building Model Management) system that I have read, and some solid examples of the advanced scheduling features.Great book and reference for anyone using ADT2004. I will continue to use his books as my training reference, as I have with his ADT3.3 books."
4,easily describes the symbolism in common shapes and patterns,"Ever since reading ""Sacred Geometry"" I am much more aware of the shapes that surround us in our everyday life. This was a concise, compact book that easily describes the symbolism in common shapes and patterns. I only wish it had more information.Tracey L. Ulshafer, author ""Butterfly"""
5,Sacred Geometry,I have not read this yet but looks very interesting and very pleased with it if any one asked yes I would recommend this book
2,"Amusing, but full of silly new-age nonsense","As someone with an interest in mathematics and geometry in particular I thought this looked like a fun book to sit down with while enjoying a cup of coffee. The title should have tipped me off to the silliness of the content, but after briefly flipping through the pages I figured it might be worth checking out.It was amusing, but I found myself constantly rolling my eyes at the flaky, new-age comments about magic, the anthropomorphizing of nature, and some outright absurd comments like ""Everything is made of light...""A much better written (no new-age nonsense) and more comprehensive book on the subject would be The Divine Proportion by H.E. Huntley"
2,not what I expected,I found the book to be quite superficial. Explanations are brief and only covers recent history. I think the title is misleading as it relates ony to the proportions in which some of the architecture s being built.
1,Short,"This book is only 58 pages long so expect to have read it during breakfast , Im not sure about it, some interesting elements and ideas on tiling and how to draw a dodecagon but as I said its a very short book so is nothing more than a cursory glance , hopefully one day a project with come up where I can use some of the ideas in this book . Its cheap and I guess you get what you pay for , reminds me a bit of a black and white catalouge or something. It could be good for someone who just wants to get a basic cheap idea of what sacred geometry is with a handful of diagrams thrown in , on that front it does deliver but remember 58 pages. less than a time magazine.."
4,Not Just About Mathematics,"For those who are interested in plane geometry this book is a fun read. For those who are studying the ancient mysteries of Pythagoras, the Kabbala, Hermeticism, Freemasonry and the Alchemists this is a very worthwhile book. The author is aware of the influence that geometry had on the ancient world. She is quite good at giving the reader things to try on their own while explaining the concepts of Ancient and Esoteric geometry. When compared to ""Sacred Geometry"", by Robert Lawler, this book is not quite as comprehensive but is easier to read and more fun. Both books appeal to the same audience. Try this one first, then move on to Lawler."
4,Great primer on the basic geometric figures,"This simple book describing basic shapes is nice, contains some attractive geometric figures and displays some significant relationships between structures basic geometric figures. It is one of those books that you glance through quickly, are impressed by the contents, and yet are disappointed in the depth. With only 58 pages, half of which are diagrams, there is little space for detailed explanations of the figures. Great book, but it is only a tease into the wealth and depth of geometry."
2,Only useful for a privately held small business under $5M,"The book spends most of the text explaining unacceptable methods of valuing a company. The author says that all of these methods are not applicable for companies under $30M in sales. I disagree! Using Discounted Cash Flow methods to place a value on a company is widely accepted compared to ""rule of thumb"" approaches.His explanation of the DCF and other NPV methods is also flawed. He ignores the cash flow impact of debt, capital expenditures and working capital changes!His book is only good for a small business owner with sales probably under $3M to $5M."
2,"Nice try, nice title but needs more work...",I found it to be sometimes incomplete and sometimes very confusing (especially unacceptable methods of pricing)...
3,Great Music / Horrendous Sound Quality,"Eric Clapton asked Free guitarist Paul Kossoff ""How the hell do you do that"" referring to Kossoff's signature vibrato. In his last interview in Guitar Player magazine, Kossoff commented on a recent Clapton concert he witnessed by saying ""He whipped up quite a storm.""Two guitar legends, two sound qualities. Free's BBC recordings are crisp and sharp. I simply could not believe how muddled the Cream recordings sounded,Now I will ask the question to the persons responsible for making Cream sound muddled in 2007: ""How the hell do you do that?"" Were you afraid to spend a few more pennies to clean up the sound of these recordings?Inexcusable. Clapton and Kossoff forever."
3,Not as good as expected,"This has the group performing live for the BBC. The sound quality is not as good as other BBC sessions I have heard. Some of the songs, such as Politician, have different lyrics than what appeared on the albums. The group was a bit sloppy."
2,not worth it,"Most of the songs are almost identical to subsequent Cream releases, although a few are different enough to merit some condsideration, e.g., Crossroads (though at less than 2 minutes we're cheated out of a full version).Also, the sound quality is mediocre and the announcer is annoying. I couldn't do much about the sound quality but I was able to get rid of the announcer's intros. I ripped the CD to my PC and used Creative WaveStudio to delete the announcer's intros (other software can be used). You can then burn the edited songs back to CD or use them in Media Player, iTunes, or whatever."
4,A good addition if your a Creamaniac,"I got wind of these recordings from Pandora. Bought the CD based on what I heard there. It's nice, as a real Cream fan, to have more versions of their limited set of songs. However, they don't add greatly and the interviews are flat=out lame. If you don't have the Albert Hall CD/DVD, get that first."
4,Raw but with energy,"Like all of the BBC Sessions collections (Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles) I just had to have it for my collection. As a Cream fan I find it raw but energetic, no wasted time on solos, although I love the extended jams from Live I and II. If you are not interested in Cream beyond what you hear on Classic Rock stations, don't purchase it. If you want to fill out your collection, you'll find some real gems."
4,they creamed the BBC with this session,"eric clapton don't get his new album if you want him at his best get this..cd and any cream cd for a matter of factjack bruce get songs for the tailor classic jazz/rock masterpieceGINGER baker the maniac drummer who can still play just as goodwell done to the review of the cream at the bbc and what a session this was a full frontal ride with the cream and to have snippets of interviews with eric clapton adds to the atomspherethe cream were as my opipion best liveand as i'm only 19 i never got to see them in their prime in the late 60's i did see them live at the royal albert hall and they rock the joint with all the classicsgod ginger baker i thought his was gonna have a heart attack is was playing that hardwell this cd features all the cream classics and a few unreleased songs too keep us die-hard cream fans happy,a classic session from the orignal hard rock band"
4,"Excellent songs, excellent band, excellent CD","I bought this CD in store because of the shear number of tracks on it and I wanted to get a good taste of this band after liking Sunshine of Your Love on Internet radio. Now this stuff is way before my time and I'm more of a Nirvana/Led Zeppelin person, but I wasn't disappointed. I don't listen to this CD everyday like I do others, but this CD is definately good; songs like Tales of Brave Uylesses and Sunshine of Your Love are excellent, and Sweet Wine and Wrapping Paper are really nice. It's interesting to see what they called blues back then and is now very obviously classic rock. If you like classic rock, you'll like this, but I don't recommed this to any die-hard Green Day fans or anything."
2,Weak...,"I use thin picks, and these Fender California Clear picks break every time I play. I went through a pack of 12 in a week. I then decided to buy medium ones, and they were okay. The sound was average."
1,horrible for acoustic,I bought what was intended to be a year supply of picks for a musical therapy program I started at the hospital I work at. These picks are practically useless for acoustic guitar. A pick might last me 25 minutes of playing before there is large gouges in the plastic from strumming. Absolutely the worst picks I have ever played with. I have not tried to use them with electric guitar I would assume they would fair some better but still have less life than others. I think its a shame fender put their name on these.
3,"Good brand- but I'm never buying ""thin"" again","I was told by my music teacher that I should buy ""thin"" picks to use for fine picking. I thought I would be smart and ONLY buy thin picks. Maybe I play too roughly on my guitar, but after chipping two and completely breaking one in half- I invested in a thicker gauge picks."
3,Cute but not great!,These guitar picks are in general... okay. really good size and they don't slip out of your hand. but yesterday i was strumming and one cracked in half! so their not AMAZING but good enough for an average guitar player!
2,Pick a different one,Poor packaging. I only received six of the twelve picks because the rest fell out of the box when being shipped. Decent guitar picks though.
1,"They Chopped Gene Krupa's drum solo in Sing, Sing, Sing!","I agree that this was one of the greatest musical events of the big band era. Its highlight was Sing, Sing, Sing, specifically the various solos at its end. Well, guess what? The most famous solo of them all, Gene Krupa's drum solo, isn't there. Presumably someone edited it out so the concert would fit on two CDs. It is like selecting the Hallelujah Chorus as the thing to edit from Handel's Messiah! If I had known they had mutilated the concert, I wouldn't have bought the set. Unlike the professional reviewer, I found the second CD staticy, something that could have been easily fixed with today's technology. You'd think Columbia could be trusted to reproduce properly one of their most famous recordings. No such luck! Buyer beware!"
4,look at the colour plates,"The most distinctive thing about this proceeding writeup are the colour plates at the back of the book. Lovely and memorable. Some show the geology of Mars. Others show mockups or artists' conceptions of the Mars Ball Rover and the Mars Sample Return. Look at the picture of the Mars Ball Rover. Quite different from the way that Sojourner landed successfully in 1997 and moved around on the surface. But this book was written in 1986. So the predictive effort wasn't bad.Other plates describe what is still in the future. Transportation systems for routine visits. Alas, the space program is so SLOW! Twenty years after this conference, we are still not quite at this stage."
3,outdated...:(,"great book, lots of information, sadly when the book was written 20% of the trail was unfinished. The finished portions are great, but everything from General's Cabin to US60 is outdated, and needs an update..."
5,Great,"This is one of my favorite CD's. The music great French music, just what you would imagine listening to on the streets in Paris. This CD is perfect if you want to hear the French flavor of music."
4,Masala Entertainer,"The movie is actually a jumble of all sorts Suddenly Ajay is a serious cop and a funny cop suddenly? Suddenly Arshad Warsi becomes serious for 1 scene.There are some funny scenes like the ghost night in the cab but thats it The story is as simplistic and stupid as a CID episode.Amongst performances Ayesha Takia is natural in her role and gives her best.Ajay tries hard to play a funny cop but fails, his ice cream cone thing is bad, but he is okay in some scenes Mukesh Tiwari seems better then him in comedy Arshad Warsi is funny at places Irrfan Khan is wasted but he does manage some good scenes Ali Asgar is so unintentionally hilarious that he proves that TV actors should not act in filmsWatch out for Rohit Shetty."
2,verry little quality for a lot of money,"Unless you absolutely need a tape that is this small, you are wasting your money on this product. This is a ""toy"" tool and it is astoundingly over priced for the build quality. I use this about 10 times a week to half extension and it has lasted a year... that it has lasted this long has surprised me."
2,41 cents per 0.8 ounce is more than twice the regular price,"I wait for this cereal to go on sale before I buy it and the sale price is usually $1.99 per 12 ounce box. The regular price is about $4.$28.88 for 70 small boxes of less than one ounce each is 41 cents per box/nearly per ounce. The sale price is 17 cents per ounce. The regular price is 33 cents per ounce.On the other hand, this should make two rice krispie treats with one box. Starbucks sells rice krispie treats for $2 as one of their lowest priced snacks."
5,Cajun Bry,"This cajun bry is the best stuff sprayed on uncooked shrimp then fried, little more spray and eat your heart out. What a wonderful taste."
5,Whoa!,"I wasn't sure if 3IB would be able to put out a good follow up to Advance and Vanquish, but Fire Up the Blades is excellent. I read a review that compares the change from A&V to FUtB to the change Judas Priest made between Ram It Down and Painkiller, and that's a pretty accurate analogy. Fire Up the Blades is faster and more intense than its predecessor, and it manages to maintain the trademark sound that 3IB has established for itself--thrash-like tempos and riffs blended with power metal style melodies and two vocalists--one clean, one screaming. I don't know of any other metal band that uses two vocalists in this way, and it's one of the aspects of this band that I appreciate the most. If you liked Advance and Vanquish, you'll love this. Even if you didn't really like Advance and Vanquish, it's worth hearing. If you're new to 3IB, definitely check this out--it's one of the best metal albums of 2007 and should appeal to a broad spectrum of metalheads."
5,The One and Only Field Guide for the West Indies.,Why is the One and Only?The color PlatesThe Cover and sizeThe Distribution MapsThe Basic and accurate InformationDo I mention the color plates?
1,Do not buy the Kindle version,"I got the kindle version of this book to use on my kindle fire in the field. It was a big mistake. The kindle version of this book is virtually unusable as it is a pain to navigate through and the plates are microscopic. This is currently the field guide to use in the Caribbean in it's paper form, but don't waste your money on the kindle version. If they decide to put a little effort in and make the plates at least page size then maybe it will be worth while, but for now it's worthless. It makes me wish I could return kindle purchases. Get the hard copy."
1,Is this a joke?,"This cat food literally has the consistency of chicken noodle soup. It is at least 70% water. And I mean straight up WATER.. not moisture. You shake the can and it sounds like it's full of liquid, and it is.My cats didn't even bother to smell it, much less taste it, and they will eat darn near anything.The first time, I dumped it in a bowl and it looked like some kind of soup with a few fragments of ground meat.The second time, I tried squeezing out the can with the lid, like how you would squeeze out the water in a can of tuna. This yielded maybe 2 ounces of food in the 6 ounce can. The cats wouldn't eat that either.In summary, this is the most pathetic excuse for cat food I have EVER seen and I have lived with cats for all of my 29 years."
1,Two thumbs and four furry paws down,"I bought a can of this stuff last month. It smelled awful, like it was spoiled. The can was in good shape and it wasn't expired, so I put it out for my cats anyway thinking it might not bother them. They took two sniffs and walked away.Just today I opened another can (same brand, different flavor) and it gave one of them diarrhea. Awesome!I won't be buying Merrick again. There are too many reliable brands out there to justify getting something this risky."
5,A must have for Graphic Designers,"My teacher with over 35years of experience uses and recommended the book to me, One of my best tools I have, I recommend this to anyone dealing with web and graphic design or anything that has to do with printing. would make a great gift to anyone in the field as well."
5,Fast Delivery,This is a great book and I recived it extremely fast! I will never sell this book for it will always be a referece to look back to.
2,Graphic Master 8 (review),"[[ASIN:0914218158 Graphics Master 8 - The workbook of Graphic Arts Reference Guides,]Great Book but was disappointed that it was used when i bought it as brand new. Not sure Amazon is the way to go when purchasing books new.I will say for a used book it was in good shape though."
2,UMMM???,"The only issues I have is that when this item arrived and I put it on my gibson with cream binding, they dont match at all. I dont think these are true cream. I am kind of disappointed but oh well I guess."
3,"Overall: Good, but not great.","Grade based on stars, 1-5. No songs receive a 5 star. 4 songs get 4 stars, 6 get 3 stars. The rest are lower. Best songs for me are Dia de Los Muertos, Disaster, Musical Pollution and Used to Love Her.Overall, I would agree that there are better VGS albums. However, this album is still worth buying for the handful of songs that are great. Especially if you are a VGS fan."
4,Good,This album may be a little different from the others but you won't be disappointed if you're really into voodoo glow skulls.In my opinion they're all the same. They're all good.
3,Just doesn't do it for me,"Steady As She Goes was a much better album in my opinion. All of the Glow Skulls stuff is great, but this one is definately not all the way up to their standards.The album does have some highlights though. I reccomend ""Ghettoblaster,"" ""Addiccion, Tradicion, Revolucion,"" ""Eville,"" and the Guns 'n' Roses cover ""Used to Love Her""Anyways, if you're new to the Glow Skulls, pick up Firme, Baille de Los Locos, or Steady as She Goes first. If you're not new to the Glow Skulls, I'm assuming that you probably already have this album."
5,Great lens,"Great lens, use it for outdoor evening sports. You can capture fast action (lacrosse,football) without the need for a flash."
3,I will not buy a lens from here again,I ordered this lens from here because they had the best price.Amazon shipped it in a single box with no added packing materials. When the lens arrived it was DOA. It would not Auto focus or manual focus.I shipped it back and asked for my money back. I spent more money at a different dealer for the same lens. It worked when it showed up. The lens works very well on my D300 great color and very sharp wide open. I can highly recommend the lens I can not recommend ordering it from here. They packaged it like it was a book not a $2100 lens.I will say that the return was painless and I did get the money credited to my card relatively quickly
1,dont buy this item,Bodum makes a much better product. i am very unhappy with this one. the filter allows the coffee grinds through and the pump gets very hot. i bought this after my Bodum broke and thought with the Pyrex name on the glass it would be a good purchase. id use my broken bodum over this.
5,"Dakar Sound ""their thing""""","I have about 2000 African cds and lps in my collection and this is one of the most played. The sound is raw, full of energy, syncopation and rips. If you like Youssou N'Dours songs such as ""Taw"" and mmigres"" from the Immigres CD, then this cd is for youPeter"
2,Creamy....but unimpressive.,"I was looking forward to a hearty, rich soup, and instead got this Corn Chowder- the corn was soggy and not crisp, the soup was almost 'curdled' even though it was defintely within the shelf life of the product, and the smell...well, my husband actually asked if I'd opened up a can of dog food in the house. The flavor was bland and slightly salty. I took a few bites and threw it out- however, I am a picky eater, and some people might enjoy this, if they like thick, greasy food."
2,Works but not touchable,"It did work, but it made my hair feel disgusting. If you just need it to look fuller, but don't ever want to touch it, it's great. I think the TIGI little pump bottle (purple round dispenser) works even better, but still leaves a residue that makes my scalp feel like it is suffocating."
5,loved it,We looked everywhere for this movie and we were so happy to find it here at such a reasonable price
5,The Unrealized Dreams Of Three Brothers In 1940's New York,"In this movie Sylvester Stallone plays Cosmo Carboni who seeks a better life than the one he has in Hell's Kitchen back in the 1940's. He dreams to escape just might be realized when he convinces his brother to become a Profesional Wrestler going by the name of 'Kid Salami"". Armade Assante is also in this film and gives a very good performance as the ordinary guy who has dreams of a better life. Anne Archer is also present in this movie and as always she is a very classy lady to watch. This is a very good movie about unfullfilled Hopes and Dreams and the Importance Of Family."
2,Kid salami,The first scene is pretty neat. Stallone sprinting on rooftops for money. I think that scene inspired the rocky training montages. Can't really say that the rest of the film is worth watching. This is one of those films that will never make it to DVD and I can completely understand why. I doubt there are many people out there willing to purchase it. I think the movie could have done alot better without the wrestling aspect of the story. Stallone has a habit of starting a story off well and then mixing some stupid sport into it. It worked with the rocky movies but that's about it.Kid Salami is one of the dumbest names I've ever heard.
2,"Yo, don't waste your dough on dis moofy, know what I'm sayin","There are a couple of inspired scenes in this movie, one in which Sly is carrying a large block of ice up the stairs of his apartment building and he drops it and it shatters, and the inspired climactic fight sequence in which the ring is out in the open and the contestants are wrestling during a thunderstorm. There are the obvious parallels to ROCKY and one scene of animal cruelty which I found disturbing (in NZ this movie is R16 despite being PG everywhere else. Stoopid huh?) but otherwise this is a rambling incoherant mess. Still, Sly has made far worse."
3,"Fueding, fighting,dames,and the disire to leave the slums.","With 3 brothers trying to put their difference aside, they try to conquer the wrestling world. With Cosmo(Stallone), and brother Lenny(Arsanti)arguing over the same dame like teenage kids. Their youngest brother VICTOR is stomping butt in HIGH OCTANE wresling matches. I personally think that Stallone(who directed the movie) should have used better, and more ferocious wrestlers than Ray Stevenson,Ted Debiosi, and the Funks. Although Terry Funk's lines were hilarious, and every wrestling buff out there knows that he is the King of HARDCORE wreslting. A very good betrayal of if you can't fight, get someone bigger than you to fight for you."
1,A picture is worth nothing on the Internet!,"I saw the Mixmaster on line...I even researched this model. In the photo it looked perfect, however, when it arrived, it was made out of plastic, not metal. It was so light, that I thought it would fall off the counter. Sorry, sent it back for a full refund!"
1,"Had for one year, then broke","The dough clings to the sides so you need a spatula to constantly scrape it down. Also, has a plastic piece on one of the beaters that always collects stuff that is hard to get out. It doesn't mix what is on the very bottom of the bowl. Also, I recieved it for Christmas last year and at Christmas time this year the base broke off and won't go back on and then this weekend we baked cookies and while I was eating one I bit into a piece of metal. I finally figured out that it was from one of the beaters. I am now using my hand mixer again. Too bad. I thought a stand mixer would be better."
1,It Sucks,I borrowed this product from my mom. I don't know if she had problem with it or not. But started making a cake and within a minute of using it I turned up the speed and out of no where it stopped working. The mixer when lifted up off of the base came off of the base and will not snap back on and the latch in the back is now in the bottom. Yea very lovely product. When I go and buy one I am going to spend the extra money and get a good one.
1,"Get a hand mixer instead, it's less work.","This mixer is useless. It sloshes all of the baking materials up on the sides so you have to scrape the sides constantly with a spatula. All it does is mix and spin so only the bottom stuff is getting blended. I ended up with inconsistent dough - the stuff that was being mixed at the bottom was too runny and the stuff that was clinging to the sides was too thick. I ended up putting in more effort with mixer than I would if I was using a hand mixer. Also, it does not have ten speeds, it has only three. The numbers on the side lie."
3,Satisfactory,I've used my Mixmaster Model 2379 several times since purchasing it a month ago. It mixed dough for chocolate chip cookies to the very end. I felt I may have to stop the mixer and add the final cups of flour by hand. The mixer handled the mixing without bogging down.
4,"Sunbeam 2379 Mixmaster Stand Mixer, Chrome","This is a great mixer, and runs very quietly. I love the way the beaters go to the sides and bottom of the mixing bowls. The only thing I wish it had would be a handle on the bowl."
1,Not made correct,I think they could have put a little more thought into the bread mixing beaters. The dough rises into the beater sockets and is a mess to clean. Very dissatisfied.
1,Inconsistent motor speed!,"I too bought this mixer with high hopes. We'd had a Sunbeam mixer when growing up and it was great. STOP THERE -not so the modern version. It is a total disappointment. The worse thing about this mixer is the motor speed. When you turn the dial you may get nothing until you have turned past the slower speeds, then suddenly you have too high a speed. If you try to turn it down, it stalls. If you leave it on any speed that is in the lower range (if you get it to run slower at all), it surges and often quits. I've gone back to using my hand mixer and wish I'd sprung for a Kitchen Aid to begin with!"
2,"D for product, A for customer service","While I WAS refunded my money (including the S&H;), I still feel obligated to leave this review for potential customers:As other reviews have touched upon, while the bowl and whisks are authentic/metal and actually quite nice, this mixer is actually silver-painted plastic and does feel very cheap. Also, though I purchased this blender NEW, it arrived broken.On the positive side, however, the seller gave me a full refund including the massive shipping fee. Any company these days that will return an item without making a customer jump through hoops (if they allow the return at all) is worth noting.Verdict: D for product, A for customer service"
4,sunbeam mixmaster,"I really like this. I had an Oster all-in-one for about 20 years and had to break down and buy a mixer, blender, and processor. I only wish this mixer was a little heavier (the mixers, bowls, and total component.) It was the closest I could find to my Oster. It was also sold at a good price here."
2,"ebayer good, item sub standard",The item was received in a timely manner. THe item does nto perform well under standard use. The motor speed is inconsistent.
4,One month old Sunbeam 2379 Mixmaster,"For the low price, it works just as good as the brand name. My wife used it four times so far to make cake and she's been very happy with it."
2,SUNBEAM 2379 MIXMASTER STAND MIXER 300-WATT 12 SPEED,"I PURCHASED THIS MIXER FOR THE PURPOSE OF USING FOR HEAVY DUTY MIXING JOBS. I MAKE CANDY AS A BUSINESS, AND THIS MIXER DOES NOT STAND UP TO THE TEST. I CAN NOTEVEN MAKE DIVINITY WITH IT, WHICH IS ONE OF MY BEST SELLERS. THIS CANDY REQUIRES CONSTANT MIXING AT HIGH SPEED FOR APPROXIMATELY 14-16 MINUTES AND THIS MIXER CANNOT HANDLE THE STRESS. IT MAKES LOUD STRAINING NOISES WHEN I TRY TO USE IT. I WISH I HADN'T BOUGHT IT. I NEED SOMETHING MUCH MORE POWERFULL."
3,Great for light duty,We purchased this model to see if we would use it enough to justify getting a more expensive model. The unit performs well and we do not intend to replace it with a more heavy duty model since we do not use it that often. The motor seems to have enough power that it never bogged down or slowed down when we used it. I would definitely recommend this for people who don't know if they need the higher priced models and just want to use a mixer every once in a while.
1,Not Good :-(,"I purchased this mixer thinking that it wudnt be that bad as it is made of chrome steel. But as soon as i opened the package i was very disappointed. Its steel plated and the inside is ALL plastic. I tried kneading small amount of bread using the smaller vessel and the mixer started to slide on the countertop. The upper part of the mixer was shaking as if its going to break or cause some accident. This is with a very small amount of dough, imagine how its going to be if i use the bigger vessel with more dough. This is NOT FOR DOUGH KNEADING. I woudnt pay $80 for a mixier that coudnt knead. Si i just returned it.If you knead a light mixer like for whipping, cake mixing etc it might be good but not for dough kneading."
2,Not So Great,I wanted a Kitchen Aid and got this instead. I wish I had saved my money and got the Kitchen Aid. It isn't strong enough to mix all the ingredients of anything I've tried to mix. I constantly have to stop the mixer and hand mix because the ingredients on the edge of the bowl doesn't get mixed in with the batter. This is horrible with homemade mashed potatoes. I have to hand do those with my potato masher.
2,"Sunbeam Mixmaster Stand Mixer, Chrome","I was disappointed in this mixer after having used Sunbeam mixers throughout my 45 year marriage. I use a mixer frequently and want one that has a detached head. Hand mixers are not powerful enough for my needs.This mixer was plastic. The bowls required twisting into holding slots. The beaters were similar to hand mixer beaters--not heavy duty. I returned the mixer, had my old one repaired, and bought a 1980 model on e-bay to keep as a spare."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I recieved this as a gift for christmas last year and have had nothing but problems! After only a handful of uses the prongs on the bowls that attatch to the mixer came off of each bowl. After Sunbeam sent me a new set of bowls, the mixer itself stopped working. It just gradually slowed mixing until it stopped altogether. Sunbeam sent me a new mixer and I am not sure how long this one will last but now I have a broken mixer and two sets of bowls that are useless taking up space! I feel bad because my husband purchased it and he thought he got the deal of a century because I had wanted a mixer for years!!Please spend the extra money and get a good quality mixer!"
1,so disappointed!,"The description of this mixer did not say it is made of cheap plastic! All it says is 'Chrome', which it definitely is not. would not purchase had I known."
5,Gift,"Was a Christmas gift, they loved it..they have many plans for it.. it came with bowl and 3 different beater attachments"
3,Mixer is okay,The mixer is good the beaters on the other hand are not so good. They are to stiff and will not blend cake mix without lumps in it. The old model we have has very flexible beaters and it always work great.
2,Do not use for long periods of time!!,worked great until it burned out on me in less than a year. I didn't even use it that much.. Very disappointing
2,like 2 cook,"i usually give good reviews but i would like 2 tell the next customer, that this product works sufficiently but is very flimsy the body itself is made of plastic and the bottom of the mix master is uneven so it wobbles when it is in use..... sorry but i cannot in all good concious recommend this product...."
3,Sunbeam Mixer,"When we received this mixer and discovered that it only comes with one mixing bowl, I was quite disappointed. I have this mixer so I bought one for my daughter, this one only comes with one size bowl, you must purchase the smaller bowl separately, it is used quite often in mixing mixtures and quite necessary. I have used sunbeam Mixers for years and love the fact that it is light enough to move from counter to cabinet or pantry to put it away."
4,Are you serious about writing your book?,"If your answer is ""Yes!"" then this DVD will help. Filmed at one of her seminars, Eva Shaw covers the Bubble Method for brainstorming and organizing ideas. She demonstrates the method's use, explaining as she goes, and includes clips from the audience question and answer period at the end. The same method can be used for articles, short stories, and pretty much any other form of the written word. I've watched it a couple of times and recommend it for anyone overwhelmed by the task of assembling their thoughts and notes into a well-planned piece of work. So, that being said, are you serious or not?"
2,Waste of Time,"I am sorry to say I was deeply disappointed in this DVD. It is an amateur video and covers a brainstorming style that every high school student has been introduced to already. I had hoped for more original material, but there was nothing in this DVD that your English teacher hasn't covered for you."
1,Ace Color-Coded Washing Machine Inlet Hose (5101P8),"Ace Color-Coded Washing Machine Inlet Hose burst in my house in less than 5 months. The red colored hot water hose has ballooned and cracked in several places; water accumulated on the floor. Clearly this ""hot water"" hose is unsuitable for using on hot water temperature (in my case doesn't even exceed 120F.)"
2,Zagats guide to Manhattan schools,"Very useful for the addresses and contact namesand numbers at each school.Otherwise the book provides the stereotypedimage associated with each school. Mixed in youwill find Zagat style sentence fragment gushings.""Many"" readers will find it ""tacky"" and ""annoying""representing a "" nose pressed up against the window""point of view.Better to just invest the time and visit the schools."
3,Who needs Stephen King??,"You can read this book and get just as horrified. The authors give lots of practical information in one central place, but stop short of telling what we really need to know. What does acceptance REALLY entail? What sort of student flourishes at each school? Does actual merit count for anything, or is it all just luck, appearance and connections? Also they are inconsistent with their descriptions of the schools~ for example they describe a sports or music program at one school, but don't even mention those programs or lack thereof at others. All in all,buying this one of the many necessary evils to raising a child in NYC if you are not fortunate enough to have connections."
2,Disappointing.,The descriptions are inconsistent; it seems the researchers were a bit lazy and simply took what they were given from the different schools. Not very useful.
5,Getting one for son going away to university,"I and hubby have been using this book for over a decade. It's dog-eared and stained and falls open to our favorite recipes. One of the reviewers mentioned the matzo ball recipe-that's the only error I've found, but what cook doesn't add and ""improve"" the recipes given? It still doesn't take away from this simple, easy to follow, and delicious recipes. My 18yr old son, going away to college, is taking ours' with him, his favorites being the kugel, the chicken soup (and matzo balls-correction will be written in), brisket, all the different kinds and many more. I have to buy this from an independent vendor now, but the extra shipping is well worth it. I have a ton of cookbooks, and this one, along with my Fannie Farmer, regularly leaves the cookbook shelves. Enjoy!"
1,Not an American made Tool,"I wish that I had known that the hacksaw was not made in America(USA). There are so few items manufactured in America, anymore. I make it a practice to buy tools that are made in America. If a tool is imported, it should say so. I was very disappointed."
1,Almost the same as the 2.0 release/version,"The contents of this book are almost the same as the previous version (2.0). The 4.0 release of the M.D. software have had lots of improvements and new tools that aren't reflected in the new version of the book.The 4.0 release book has less information than the previous (2.0). One example is that NURBS Surfaces subject is not included in this new version (in the 2.0 it was). The exercises are the same, with the same sketches!So, whatever you are a new or advanced M.D. user you might consider buying the 2.0 book version with the 3.0 update, it's less expensive and will be more helpful."
1,Very disappointed!,Very disappointed with this book. The examples are few and the explanations stopped short. Not very helpful to new users.
5,Authoritative analysis of the February Revolution,"An excellent, clearly written analysis of the events that led up to the February Revolution. A must read for every student of European and Russian history."
4,A cultural awakening for all who read it!!!,"""If nobody writes about you, you are thought not to exist. Through this work you will see that the black upper class is an acknowledged institution in cities all over the country. Great families that set the standards, style, and tone of Society are examined with great respect. An account of the origins and impeccable histories of some of the most prominent black families is told with such depth that it makes it hard to put this book down. If the black experience is going to be told it must be told from all aspects. Gerri Majors must be commended for sharing her life with us."
2,Good premise but weak development,"Overal premise and approach are interesting, and a couple of scenes and some descriptions are noteworthy. But...The book is generally very slow. The story unfolds in such tempo that it lulls reader into sleep. The setting doesn't give a feel of Paris at all, a giant vortex of Bohemean life and huge center of culture, for the way it's described - it all might've happened somewhere in a small town in Ohio.Characters remain somewhat flat and quite faceless, except Pankratov (but, as we know, oddish old cranks is quite easy material to describe in literature).Generally the book is a way too straightforward and, as it lacks true intrique, twists and any tension, it leaves an impression of uninspired work that the authour managed to deliver through a lengthy spell of his own boredom."
3,Interesting premise,"I owned this book for a long time before I could muster up the desire to read it. The premise sounded very interesting and the historical facts behind it were new to me, but something about reading about WWII sounded depressing.The book was anything but depressing. It started off alittle slow and picked up great speed after Chapter 5 or so. The characters were well-developed, although somewhat stereotypical and predictable. The story was less about war than about loyalty and honor. I have to disagree with other viewers when they stated that too much detail was devoted to the descriptions of art and their forgeries-I found it all very interesting. The plot was quick-paced, but when I thought only days were passing, it turned out to be years.I do recommend this book. I must admit that I did look forward to picking it up and continuing to read it once I started. While suitable for both, I think that men might find the plot and wartime atmosphere more appealing than women."
2,The Forger,"The book has a fascinating premise woven in the historical context of art plundering by the Nazis. The characters are well developed and interesting. Unfortunately, toward the last third of the book, credibility is strained about how the German authorities reacted to the plot. Moreover, the climax of the book is extremely disappointing and lacked a decent plot twist."
1,Artless Storytelling,"I picked up this novel against my better judgment (I tried to read one of Watkins other books---In the Blue Light of African Dreams---which was equally poor) simply because it was about Paris and the story sounded enticing. Sadly, the author is so artless in his storytelling that there is little to make me even want to finish the book. His writing style is non-existent: The book reads like a slapdash first draft. The main character is a blank canvas, and while the other characters have interesting backgrounds, they don't live or breathe. Finally, there are so many preposterous twists and errors of time and setting that even the enticing story ends up being unbelievable and uninteresting."
4,"Good story in a dramatic, historic setting....","This was the first thing I've read by Paul Watkins. It won't be the last. This is an engaging story with interesting characters who are caught, as everyone was, in the fast moving events of war in Europe.It reminded me somewhat of Alan Furst, one of my favorite writers (""Dark Star"", ""The Polish Lieutenant"", several others) Furst's work is darker, even more atmospheric and told from a stronger European perspective. ""The Forger"" is a lighter read, yet still has substance. I'd recommend this book for its story, characters, and the fascinating picture of certain aspects of the art world, forgery, etc."
4,_Hounds of the Morrigan_ is a great book!,"I first read _Hounds of the Morrigan_ when I was twelve or so, having checked it out of my local library. It was a funny, fanciful, engaging read, and I fell instantly in love with the tale of Irish children, Pidge and Bridgit, and their battle with the evil Faerie queen of darkness, the Morrigan. Some time later, hoping to reread the book, I visited the library again, to face the disappointment that O'Shea's wonderful tale was no longer in stock. I was thrilled to find _Hounds_ at Amazon.com, and ordered it as a Christmas gift for my relational partner. Upon rereading the novel, I found that _Hounds of the Morrigan_ is still as intriguing today as it was one winter afternoon when I was younger. _Hounds_ is a funny, intriguing read, which holds fun for all ages. If you like fantasy, or Celtic legend--or just any original, imaginative tale--you're sure to LOVE _Hounds of the Morrigan_!"
4,I loved it!,I read the book this year on my trip to New York and I loved it. It was a great book. The author writes magnificently and she has so much imagination. I think they should make a movie about it! Why not? I mean they're making one on the lord of the Rings! I want to see that. SOolooMAke a MOVIE!
3,It could have been shorter,"This book started out really good, but in the middle 400 pages it seems like all that happens is Pidge and Bridget traveling, hiding from the hounds, and meeting friendly encounters who help them along the way. This is all well and good, but there was a lot that could have been taken out. At the end the plot picked up again, but it didn't really go anywhere in the middle.Some people might not mind this, but if you like a little more substance in the middle of books that are nearly 700 pages long, you might want to find something else to read. But otherwise, this might be worth your time, because it's funny and very original."
4,"A good, but the end is a dissapointment","I was really intrigued when I first saw this book and the store. So I bought it, and liked it with the exception of the ending. Pidge and Bridget live in Ireland and go on an amazing adventure for Dagda. They are on a mission to find 1 or both of the blood stones of Morrigan's blood. These are og importance because they will destroy the Olc-glass, which will stop Morrigan from taking over the world. Pidge and Bridget meet many friends who guide them when they get lost, or help them when they are stranded. It may get confusing at times, but it is good none the less. Lots of detail, so that you can imagine all the places and events in your head.Though I must say the end was HIGHLY disappointing. I read the whole thing only to have a sucky ending. That is why I only gave it 4 stars. If you buy this book I'm warning you not to expect a decent ending."
5,The Best Book Ever!,"All I have to say about this book is that it is written beautifully and the storyline is brilliant! I've read it so many times I almost know the book word for word by now! It holds so many elements that make books good such as humor, suspense, fantasy, ETC. I highly reccommend it!"
4,not a harry potter,"i did find this book to be interesting and quite enjoyable. however, it was no harry potter. it gets boring at times and confusing with all the irish names and details just to complicate the story. cut off the fat is what i say! so while i would recommend the book, make sure your have time to read it and don't just read it once in a while. you'll forget the plot and ruin the book for yourself, trust me. so if you do read it (which you should, despite some of my comments), have a great time-it's a trip!"
5,Great! Fantastic YA fantasy.,"One of the best YA fantasies to date, fully up there with Susan Cooper and Alan Garner- and the book is somewhat evocative of both authors.Not just for kids, I suggest this for adults who want something as a bedtime read.I have one issue with the author- apparently this is her only major work, and I want more!"
5,The Hounds of the Morrigan,"hi my name is mikethis book is confusing in places, because of the Irish but in the whole it was brilliant.the story is abowt too kids save ing the wold.I recomend it to reders 15+.I like the eel that talks & the snake on the paper that moves in the corner of your eye."
5,This is truly one of the best books in the world!!!,"I first found this in my middle school library in about 6th or 7th grade. I've looked for it in every bookstore I've been in for years, and am so glad to have finally found it! Any lover of fantasy books will like the adventures of Pidge and Brigit as they fight the Morrigan. The part with the maze is especially neat. Those who've read it will know what I mean, The rest of you need to read this one!!"
3,Disappointed,I purchased this book for a friend's 60th birthday. She loved Beverly Cleary books as a young girl. The book is in good condition but I was expecting and wanted the dust cover shown on the website. When the book came it had a cover from 1987. I was very disappointed.
1,So Incredably Boring!,The Book Just Dragged On ANd On! It Told Me Nothing About Magick. Man Did It Suck!
2,Bootleg of VHS,The original film is not great to begin with but this VHS dupe is a pretty poor copy. To make matters worse the copy of the original movie poster with great art by Neal Adams used on the cover is a badly retouched version. I think the VHS release is even better than this. Probably til they come out with a better resolution dvd you would be better off just getting the original VHS tape.
1,Not for developers needing examples...,"1444 pages of bits and pieces of how to create and deploy on Web Logic 8.1. Absolutley no cohesive transition of how to create and deploy even a simple J2EE application. The book will explain piece parts very well such as the XML descriptors and each J2EE API. But if you want to try out web logic and create an application quick and easy, this book is definately not for the beginner...."
2,random work,"first unleashed book i bought - and probably the last. i tend to prefer a-press, o'reilly or manning for you who read books and know quality from quantity. the unleashed book is almost a random collection of j2ee chapters with very little relation to weblogic of any version. shure those chapters do have some value in and by them self but i got the book to get up to speed on weblogic version 8.1. i know j2ee already so about 7o% was wasted on me. yes, there are some config weblogic sections and how to install(not great) but a from a-z on how to get going with the appserver it just does not deliver. maybe too many persons involved. it's usually a warning sign with all the names of contributors. but then again. I did look at other books on the subject and they all seemed to be alike. wait until o'reilly sets the benchmark...again"
3,Not quite what they use to be!,"This grill was suppose to be the exact grill they(meco) have been making for 30 yrs according to their sales department. First off it came with little dings and scratchs, second the coating of the bowl isnt nearly what it use to be. This grill was suppose replace my dads grill hes had for about 30yrs, the exact same one, but the quality has definetly slipped since back then. I guess I wouldnt be as disappointed if I hadnt been told that it was as good quality as it was from the beginning, including the coating. Not a bad grill just not what I was told it would be!"
3,Some reassembly required,"I've used a Meco 4100 Swinger II charcoal grill for fourteen years. I like the adjustable grill height and venting. It's been a great, cheap grill, mostly made in USA. I ordered one for my father with the shelves and it came all unassembled and with lousy hardware. Some units are sold with the top and bottom already assembled, and these are riveted like mine was. Using the supplied hardware resulted in a grill that was so loose and sloppy I had to take it apart and rivet it together. Then it worked like my other one. But the parts supplied weren't as the instructions said, and the documentation has errors. Don't get this particular model if you don't have a riveter. Once properly assembled it is a great charcoal grill for a hundred bucks."
3,"Lens okay, dealer slightly misleading","I was very pleased with the price until a week later when Sigma came out with a later version of the very same lens, with image stabalization. No wonder I received such a good price! I've delat with other companies in the past who have given me a heads-up on an upcoming change, and the opportunity to buy the later model. Thanks a lot!"
1,obviously fake,don't spend so much on a fake ladies. pic is blurry but real coach bags never come with handles wrapped in plastic.
4,A Perfect Companion on a Long Drive,"If your driving through the country and have a great imagination, ""The Wild West"" will take you on a memorable journey. Share the dilemma of a down and out gambler stuck in a snowstorm. Live through the terror of Anthrax hitting a herd of cows. Enjoy the timeless ""The Celebrated Frog of Calaveras County"". These tapes are filled with rich stories that easily cath up the reader. Be warned-if you rather hear stories of shootouts and fist fights, look elsewhere. The cover is deceiving- it lists ""Performed by Jack Palance"" underneath the title. Not all the stories are told by Palance, but the other narrators are just as good, if not as famous. These stories appeal to any lover of literature because of the richness of the charaters and the fluidity of the plots."
3,Spanish Eyes,"Got this for my 87-year-old mom. Not really my kind of music, but she likes it, so I guess it's good for the right person."
2,boy thats a dark cream!!,"The only issues I have is that when this item arrived and I put it on my gibson with cream binding, they dont match at all. I dont think these are true cream. I am kind of disappointed but oh well I guess."
5,"I recommend the filter, but not how long I left my last one in.","It definitely works as a filter because, after not changing my original since before the advent of the internet, it became so clogged, water would no longer flow freely through it. I recommend changing them more frequently than this, as I intend to do from now on."
2,not really sure it does the job,"I'm giving this a 2 star as I can't tell any difference on my skin or hair that this filter is doing a darn thing. It definitely leaks around the center seam, but not so much that it affects the flow to the shower head. Just not real impressed whatsoever by this filter. I would look to another brand next time around if I decide to purchase another."
4,Good--won't last forever.,"I've used this thing for the last six years, replacing the filters all the while. Eventually, the casing will sever and water will shoot out the sides. Still, it doesn't cost much more than the filters themselves, so I think it's worth it. I think my first one lasted at least five years, though. I love this product."
4,cleaner hair,"My hair feels cleaner and our soap and shampoo seem to have more bubbles, woo hoo. I hope it last the estimated 6-7 months before clogging up."
1,they sent me the replacement filter not the shower head,"i payed for a shower filter, this is not what I got, I received a replacement filter only- no filter head. I payed for the shower head which is much more expensive than the replacement filter. I live abroad so this is going to be a pain. Not that I wont need it but in the mean time its useless until I buy the shower head."
3,Does it filter out fluoride? I've not used this filter yet.,I'm looking for a shower filter to filter out fluoride as well....anyone know of one that does that doesn't break the bank?
1,Doesn't really work for me :(,"I have long term eczema problem, finally I decided to give this product a try based on the review, after I used it for straight 2 months, I really really couldn't tell any difference, I still have skin rashes and I even make sure I put on moisturizer on my body right after the shower too. My hair still feels dry afterward....I also notice the water start leaking from the middle...I don't know, maybe it's just my bad luck...."
2,Shower head emits copper,"I've been using this shower filter for a couple months. The filter seems to work fine, but in the last few weeks I've noticed a metallic smell in the water. It smelled like copper. Upon closer inspection I found copper deposits building up on the inner surfaces of the head. I replaced the head with another that doesn't have a copper element and the problem was resolved. This type of copper exposure is not simply unpleasant (your skin ends up smelling like copper), but it is also potentially unsafe."
3,"Nice pictures, strange size","The book is great if you are just looking for a collection of Halstons's fashion photos. There are really great shots of the clothes, and a lot of the glamorous people that wore them. The book, however, is a really strange size. It's really small, but really thick (6"" by 4"",and about 3 inches thick). I was anticipating a coffee table type book, but this is too odd of a size to display lying on a table. The text was a bit random and sparse, and the type identifying the photos was difficult to read on several pages. I liked it overall, but it will end up on shelf and I probably won't pick it up very often."
2,For people looking for a small coffee table book...,"I bought this book not realizing that it was a small book. Yes, very thick but small nonetheless. The photos need to be viewed in a larger format and the captions in red are impossible to read. The typesetting makes for difficult reading. Phaidon really let me down on this one."
2,Lousy Gatlin CD,The music on this particular Gatlin Bros. CD sucked. Maybe it's too old technology wise.
5,Gatlins Rule,"If you are a Gatlin fan, this is the CD for you. Has a ton of great songs and takes me right back to the good old days. Highly recommend this CD."
4,Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers,"All the songs on this CD are classic Gatlin Bros. One of my favorites is Track 10, ""Almost Called Her Baby By Mistake"" because I think all of us, at one time or another, have either felt this way - or said it. It's a song about love on the rebound, and I'm sure we've all been there, done that. If you like the Gatlin's, then this is a must have for your collection (If you don't already have it). Of special note is the drummer in ""Denver."" I don't know who it is, but man, are they GOOD!!!!"
4,As advertised,"This tool is just fine for what it is. It should be less than half the price, but it does what it says. It would be nice if it could be shortened or angled. It's a little too long to use on my Homelite backpack blower. I have to loosen the carb and turn it slightly so I can use the tool to make adjustments."
4,GreaseMonkey,Tool worked well had no issues making carburator adjustments. Price seemed a little expensive but couldnt find a cheaper one.
1,Non usable,"I waited for this tool to arrive to adjust my edger, and when it finally came the end of the tool was egg shaped. It would not fit in the recess where the adjustment is. I had to return the tool and believe it was poor quality control."
4,good condition,Fast and good.But the content is about ACESS 2003 os if anyone want to know things about ACESS2007 should buy newer edition.
3,Out of Date,"I don't know who to be upset with the author of this book, or my school for forcing me to use such an out of date book. As far as the book goes it is decent, and easy to read and follow, but I honestly can't say if it helped me or not because all the workbook problems are based on Access 2005, and trying to search for one of those, good luck. Access 2005 is completely different then Access 2007, so translating the workbook problems itself is difficult enough, and God help you if you do something wrong, because trying to figure that is is impossible. I give it 3 stars because I think if I was to use this book back in 2005, then it would of been pretty good, but now almost 10yrs later.........find something for up to date"
1,Soup Sandwich,This book was written in a very disorganized fashion as it seemed the Author/s were constantly suggesting things that you could not do with the DBMS that you were reading about. Then to top it off all of the figures that were referenced were often pages away. All in all the book explained how it might feel to walk through a pool of quicksand.
5,As expected,Book shipped right on time as expected. The product was in great condition just as described. This is why I buy my books from Amazon!
3,Database Concepts,"This book uses an older version of Access and the value of this book is not what it could be even from a conceptional nature. It is very difficult to read and understand because the various screens having grays on grays with not much contrast. If I were to write a book on database design for a college level course, it would start out with concepts and definitions, not examples of badly designed tables."
3,Needs work on MS Access and problem clarification,Does mention that some SQL queries do not work with Microsoft Access although it does not go into how to handle the SQL queries in Access.Also some of the homework problems are not very clearly worded and we had to get some clarification from the instructor because the questions could be interpreted several different ways leading to different results.It was a good book although it does need some rewriting and revision in the next edition. It also should have more on using MS Access instead of just mentioning that the particular query does not work with Access.
3,"Good information, bad presentation","I had to get this book for class, and it wasn't my first choice. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the writing style and depth of information. However, the font is too small and the screenshots are especially too small. That makes it unnecessarily hard to read, and also makes concentration on learning the content more difficult. In these days of electronic books with adjustable font size, not having that option is unacceptable. Even having a PDF of the pages that was not searchable would be an improvement. However, the ideal platform would be that of a Kindle."
2,"Confusing, Difficult to Follow, Overpriced",I suppose this book does fill a crucial gap within database textbooks. Too bad it's written in such a way that I can't follow it. At least not without falling asleep or wanting to slice my wrists.
3,Old Stuff,"I was hoping to get a catalog of OT passages in Paul. I didn't get it. As for Paul's thought, I recommend E.P. Sanders ""Paul and Palestinian Judaism, Krister Stendahl's ""Paul Among Jews and Gentiles"" and John Gager's ""Reinventing Paul."" Gager is especially short, to the point and helpful."
2,Be careful of the company,"This brush is part of a set called Non-surgical Face Lift which appears to be based on powdered egg-white and other things in the oil and cream. The products are not bad; they also are not unique, and fairly costly.My main problem is with the company's customer service. I had a credit card stolen which was unfortunately the card I had used to charge these products. Other companies called me, sent me e-mails. This company said they sent me a postcard, but I never saw it. The only way I knew that I was dilinquent with them was the collection agency letter. If that is ok business practice with you, buy from them. I won't be purchasing anything else from Distinction Beauty. Under our capitalistic system, there are too many competitors to buy from to suffer being dealt a hand like that!!"
5,Kent!!,Even if you don't speak Swedish you've gotta love the music of this EP. (If you do speak Swedish it's still uncertain if you might be able to hear every word.) But once you understand these lyrics the songs even get better. Kameran glider över guldgula fält...
3,"Once again good, but not that good...","Forgive me everyone. I love kent but I don't love where they are going. With the previous recording, Du & Jag Doden, and now this EP, it seams as if Kent as run out of ""good"" ideas. There is no substance. Perhaps I compare each album to the next a little to much, but how could you not? Each of these new melodies seam to be a bit more boring then the next. Don't get me wrong, i LOOVEEEE kent, but they need to give me more! I'm looking for another 747 or Music Non Stop, not a recycled melody. Forgive me, I had to give it a 3. I was too disappointed. Give me more Kent... give something good."
4,The Maya Chronicles,Very informative and useful; I mined it for some informationon a book I recently published about the last Mayan Prince(The Quetzal and the Cross by Conrad Samayoa)
2,ok... better than ok!!!!,I do not find myself going back to it. I read it a while ago. Probably ok.Nothing positive or negative remains in my mind . I picked it up again after saying it was just ok. I would like to rerate it ...better than I recalled. I will probably try some more of the suggestions. !!!!
3,I like it...,It gives you many good home remedies and tips. Some weird remedies too but they do work.
5,Good reading,"I have the other book also ""Chicken Soup & other Folk Remedies. Between the two I'm learning how to eat right. Little late but one is never too old to learn! It is informative and entertaining at the same time! Highly recommend both of these books!"
5,Johnny's the Bomb.,"This is a great ""rainy day"" CD (especially if you like rainy days). Why? Because Johnny's music spans all the moods of a rainy day--smooth and cool, fresh and sharp, even a touch of melancholy. This is a versatile CD; you can enjoy it as ambient background music to a lazy, round-the-house day or you can really get into Johnny for all his vocal charm. This collection shows Johnny off at his best."
5,The Sweetest Sound,"I began listening to Johnny Mathis in 1963, when I enrolled in college at the University of Houston to study applied voice. His music inspired me then, and continues to do so today. Although I never ""made it"" in the Big Time, I still hold on to my dream of some day being able to sing a duet with him. The music on this Album/CD covers his entire range and shows anyone who listens what a fabulous talent this man is."
5,I <3 Johnny Mathis,"This is one of the best things I've ever purchased on Amazon!!! This is a Great Album with Johnny Mathis actually singing his songs!!! lol If you like Johnny Mathis, you'll love this CD!!!"
5,Johnny M.,"Is it any wonder that Johnny Mathis should have such a successful career? This CD is testimony to his longevity. I purchased this CD especially for his classic rendition of ""Misty"" and it is well ""worth the price of admission."
5,Excellent purchase,"Product was exactly as advertised, delivered as promised, very competitive pricing, would recommend this vendor !"
5,His best songs all on one CD performed perfectly.,The timeless voice that will allow you to bring the romantic feel of the 50's into the millennium.
3,An excellent singer,"J.M. has always had a unique quality of voice that rings of deep soul searching, regardless of the song. HOWEVER, this early version can be found on much better, later 'retreads' and updated albums. I should have looked at the songs more closely because, one of his best renditions is 'Blue Bayou', which this album didn't have. I had this album in LP when it first came out."
2,Johnny Mathis Memories,"If you're a Johnny Mathis fan you must have this recording for your collection. As I browsed through the various ""best of"" cd's this one contained the most past hits I was seeking. The sound quality is excellent. So, purchase this cd, pop it in your player and let Johnny flood your mind with wonderful melodies."
5,Good selection of Johnny Mathis,Especially liked Amazon's service to rectify sending me the wrong CD initially :)
2,Johnny Mathis,"It's a great CD, but mine skips on the 2nd to last song. I have a busy life and didn't have time to call the vendor, etc. This is the down side of Amazon."
2,poor application information,"even though i double checked with the seller, to insure this was the proper part for my application, it wasn't and wouldn't work as required. it wasn't worth the trouble to pay to return it, so i just eat the cost and moved on to another supplier who apparently knew a bit more about my application needs and provided the proper adapters to match my equipment on the first try. nothing wrong with the product, and it was new in a sealed package, etc, it was just the wrong part even though their site indicated it was the proper part i needed. my rating reflects my disappointment with their ability to supply the proper parts, per their own application ""charts"", not reflective on the part itself. i'm sure for the right application, the part would have functioned well."
5,Works in my Astra,"Having been given a lot of bad information about the correct cables to fit an FM modulator to my 06 Astra, I settled on these and they work."
2,Product Pictured is not Product Delivered.,"The well point pictured is a jet point, through which water is forced to actually remove dirt/sand around the well point as it is installed. In essence, it drills it's own hole. That is what the small holes pictured on the perimeter of the blue tip are for. The products delivered were well points with the solid tips (no water jet holes), designed to be installed in an already drilled hole. I called Grady's Online and left a message to that effect along with my contact information so that we could resolve the issue. They have not followed up. I also provided a response similar to this review to an Amazon email request for feedback. I have not been contacted by Amazon either, and the problem of the item pictured vs the item delivered remains. On the high side, the wrong product was delivered promptly."
3,Campbell BBP-125-4~1.5 inch Well point,"The well point, approx. 4' with a plastic point and 3.5 feet of fine Horizontal screening perfs in the PVC is a good product for the price. Plan to use as an irrigation for pond and watering."
5,Includes tornado coverage of my school in 1964,"I wish this book was still in print. It covers the April 1964 tornado that hit my Jr. High Schoolin Lakeland, FL. It is difficult to find info on tornadoes from that time period. I do have my ownphotos, but nothing in print. This is an excellent book, but I can't afford the used price on it.I hope the author or publisher will consider publishing it again."
5,For the tornado enthusiast or general historian,"This extensive study of the ""significant"" tornadoes of the past 300 hundred years is a a fascinating read from a weatherbug perspective but also from the historian perspective. From the the book's beginning with tornado terms defined, write ups on historic tronadoes, debris path studies, how tornadoes have been recorded thru time, so many nuggets of knowledge for even the most amatuer of weather lovers or professional in meteorology.The main body of the book is a statistical amazament, in that Mr. Grazulis and his staff delved so deeply in this one subject in American history is astounding. Truly a great book for weather bugs and meteorology professors to have on the book shelf."
4,Nice visual & text intro to the classic English village,"I'm a genealogist, and since recently uncovering a lineage that takes me back into Tudor and Stewart times in several rural English counties, I've been reading about and hunting up photos of small English towns and villages. It's hard to find views that don't include motorways, television towers, and supermarkets, but this splendid book brims over with gorgeous, glossy color photos of many varieties of the ""classic"" English village. Even better, the text identifies what you're looking at in considerable detail, gives a capsule history, and explains the differences between traditions and cultures in (say) Somerset, Norfolk, and Yorkshire -- which is important for us Yanks, even those of us who are well read in history. For instance, I've heard the term ""black and white architecture,"" but really didn't have a mental picture of what it referred to. A lively piece of work."
2,Eheim makes a great filter,"I love the product and obviously the filters are essential for running the filter. They work great and I would recommend it to anyone.But if you look at the pricing, it costs 4.99 to ship. I consider that excessive and will make all future purchases of the filters at petsmart."
3,Pretty good.,"Angelina ""Angie"" Amalfi and her fiancé, Paavo Smith, go to Jackpot, Arizona, to help out a friend. Paavo once lived in Jackpot and looked forward to seeing his childhood friend, Ned Paulson, again.Hal Edwards was a long time resident in the town and one of the wealthiest around. After being missing for three months, his decomposing body is found in a cave out in the desert. ""Doc"" Loomis Griggs is the executor of Hal's estate and does not believe Hal's death was an accident. Doc wants Paavo to check things out.*** This is Angie and Paavo's thirteenth mystery together. Readers get a clearer picture of Paavo's early life as they follow along with the story. There are lots of suspects to keep readers guessing too. I found this to be a good whodunit book, even though there is not much suspense within it. I had it figured out early on - WRONGLY. ***Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
1,Trouble in this book,"""Trouble in Trinidad"" is weak, pulp writing at best. The author shows little depth at developing believable characters, especially the main character, Kevin. The worst part is when the main character seriously encourages his love interest to ""just forget"" the fact that she was raped--and she agrees that's the best way to deal with the problem. Just block something terrible out of your mind. It'll go away! My girlfriend said it was obvious that a man was the author. ""Trouble in Trinidad"" gave me hope that I could write a novel!"
1,How Lame Can You Get?,"This isn't decent Latin music. It isn't even good pop music. Ok, the songs can be catchy in an ultra cheesy, very uncool, lame-o VH-1 kind of way. VH-1 was made so lame groups like Miami Sound Machine could thrive.Listen to a few songs from the Gypsy Kings if you want good Latin music, or Santana, or even some of the tunes off the soundtrack to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, there's some surprisingly good Latin music CD's.This is why a lot of people don't like Latin music. Because lame-o's like Gloria Estupido get all the airplay! Lame 80's music that has a tiny bit of nostalgia for those of us who came of age in the 80's. Otherwise? Avoid!"
1,RIPPED OFF!!!!!,"RIPPED OFF!!! FOUND SAME PRODUCT ONLINE JUST BEFORE IT ARRIVED $40.00CHEAPER, I CAN SEE $10. BUT $40.00!!! PRODUCT'S WAIST LENGHTH ONLYGOES UP TO A 16"", I AM A 19""."
5,THE BIG BROTHER is a Great Terrorist Thriller,"Excellent!!!This is arguably one of the best novels I've ever read. I started reading THE BIG BROTHER, by Hope Newman. After that, I became engrossed in reading CRIMES OF THE RIGHT. In my opinion, this is one of NEWMAN's best novels for one reason: it doesn't drone on and on about technical jargon that doesn't contribute to the plotline. For the most part, it's written in a fairly understandable context and its short for how she likes to write. It's very good and I recommend it to anyone who has some time to read a good book."
5,Absolutely beautiful!!!,"I read in a Marvin Gaye biography that it was never his intention to become the R&B Star he became in front of legions of fans. He desired deeply to become the song stylist of his day ala Frank Sinatra. He wanted to express himself through timeless music and lyrics versus the bump and grind he was best known for...""Let's Get It On"". Truth be told, he enjoyed the success of his ""Sexual Healing"" persona but his heart was in the classics. This album represents his heart's desire. Beautiful melodies, orchestration and Marvin Gaye's voice displayed the true romantic. I have thoroughly enjoyed this album from track #1 to #11. Amazing artistry! Take a listen and hear for yourself this vocal workman."
4,Like it,"This is our car seat for our second car. We have the Roundabout in our primary car. I like both just the same. I don't actually understand some of the reviews that say the straps are difficult. We've never run into that problem. It's a very easy car seat to use once you get used to loosening it from the hips. Also, the straps don't twist up like some of the other carseats. Compares just fine to the Britax Roundabout for us. I think it's great for anyone who doesn't want to spend the extra money."
3,LOVEed it but..,"After extensive research I chose the Triumph for our second stage car seat. I LOVED this car seat, it was easy to get my little one in/out of and make adjustments. (She is 26"" tall and 15 lbs at 15 weeks and has almost outgrown her SnugRide.) HOWEVER when I took it to the fire station to ensure that it was correctly installed they were unable to get it tight enough in my Nissan Altima in the center section but he was able to install it correctly behind the driver's seat. Then we put my little girl in it and he explained why she cried every time we put her in it. If the straps are tightened correctly the chest buckle digs into her sternum and the crotch buckle hits her belly so buyer BEWARE it is a great seat but defiantly more for toddlers than infants."
3,"good seat, but not for small babies","We love this seat now, but were disapointed when we bought it for our six month old baby (when she grew out of her infant car seat).The shoulder straps were too wide apart to stay on her shoulders (and we have a big baby). I have since noticed that with most other convertable seats, the shoulder straps are closer together at lower positions,... not so with this seat. The chest clip was also too wide to keep the straps on her shoulder. This seemed very unsafe, as I believe in a collision, the baby could shoot right out of the top of the carseat, since the strap was only on one shoulder much of the time. Also, the there are only 3 widely space levels for the shoulder straps, which are too far apart to keep a good fit for a growing smaller baby.So this is a good seat for older, bigger babies, but be careful of the fit for younger ones."
2,It's a Big Clamshell that moves!,"We recieved this as a shower gift but will be returning it because the CPS tech could not secure it tight in our Acura MDX. We just bought the Britax with the latch and it fit perfectly with no movement once the rear facing tether was installed. Comparing the two seats we found some information that you might find useful: The Evenflo is very heavy and wide 19.5 inches vs. 18 inches for the Britax. The back height is only 21 inches vs. 22.5 inches for Britax. On the Evenflo, our little (10 mo / 95% percentile height & weight- ha, ha) fella's head would flop side to side and his little legs were pushing against the seat. He looked like he was being gobbled up by a Clamshell! It's a cute looking carseat but doesn't look the like the construction will hold up over time. If you have a small infant/toddler and you can get a solid fit, this might be an OK seat."
5,This car seat is a God sent,"My husband and I purchased this car seat for our daughter when she was 6 months old. She's now 2 and still loves her seat. The padding is very nice and the seat is so comfortable. Everytime we go for a car ride, she falls asleep. I'm currently looking for another of these for my 8 month old."
2,HATED IT!!!,"After much research, I decided to purchase this seat. I actually bought two, one for each car. My 7 month old cried each time I put her in it. The memory straps were much more of a problem than convenience. I had a hard time each time I put her in or out of the seat. Her arms would get caught between the loops. I took both of them back and bought a cheaper seat that has the adjustable strap at the bottom of the seat. She no longer cries each time I take her for a ride."
2,straps ...,i can't stand this carseat. i had to fight to adjust the straps properly every time i used it. this seat is NOT for the mechanically challenged!
5,great investment,I bought this seat a month ago and before i did check the reviews and i was happy with what i read. I have no problems. If you have a small back seat it may not accomidate this car seat. I like that it gives you the option to go from rear facing to forward facing when they get older. The directions are easy to understand. I wish i had this seat when my baby was first born because it stays in the car and you don't have to take it in and out. The only down side i see is that i wish it could go to a higher weight maximum.
1,Safety problems,"I had several safety problems with this car seat and have finally gotten another one. My son always slid out of shoulder straps when in the rear facing position. I constantly had to adjust the straps even though they claim that you would not have to. I finally gave up on the seat when the crotch strap stopped locking into position and my child could slide down in the seat any time. I called Evenflo and they replaced the seat with another one. I am going to return it and get a refund, Evenflo did not want to give me refund."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"If you plan to use this car seat for less than one year, then keep it; otherwise you only have a 90 day Evenflo warranty. I purchased this car seat (...) and it didn't last as long as the other seat I used for both of my daughters. When I called the company shortly after purchasing it to find out how to wash it, they told me I couln't. When I called to complain about the seat (...), it could miraculously be washed -- after 2 disgusting years -- by removing the back plate with a screwdriver. The problem now is that the velcro and backing has totally ripped apart, and when I went to remove one of the clips from the seat, it tore a hole in the fabric. If I place it in the washer, I'm sure it will fall apart. Evenflo will NOT replace the cover, but is willing to waive the shipping and handling fee if I purchase a new one. There is no recall on my model, and the customer service was shoddy.Oh yea, and my 2 year old can get out of this one too! I should've bought the Britax."
1,Can't Wash Harness,"I have had the car seat for 1 year and loved it until my daughter got sick in it and I needed to completely remove the car seat cover and straps to wash it. I didn't know at the time of purchase, the straps CAN NOT be removed!I emailed Evenflo and got the following response: ""I do apologize, the harness straps are not made to come off the seat. There is no way to get them back on and working properly. Thank you for contacting Evenflo ParentLink. We appreciate the time you took to email us. ""I then called and talked to a customer service rep and she was not very sympathetic, telling me that I should have read the instruction manual before using the car seat. She could not tell me what page the reference is on and I could not find it anywhere. She did offer me a new car seat if I paid $50 dollars. I thought they could do better than that.I give this product an unfavorable rating based solely on the unremovable straps."
2,To Much Trouble!!,"This carseat was to much trouble. Although it seems to be a comfy seat, if it is buckled in properly and tight you cant get it to recline right. If your car is not set up for the LATCH then its a pain to get your hand in the back to buckle the belt.I took this seat back the next day!!"
2,Wish I could return mine.,"If you are looking for a car seat that needs to constantly be moved from car to car (ie...you drop baby off at daycare and husband picks baby up at daycare, so you leave the car seat), this car seat is NOT for you. It is a pain to get it buckled into the car. The holes that the seat belt slide through are small, my hands barely fit. I have to peel back the material and guide the seat belt that way. It's a pain. Not to mention it is a some what heavy seat. So constantly moving it is quite a work out."
5,Best of the best,"My son love's this car seat. My 8 month old can't get enough of this car seat. We call it his ""little barca louger"". It has so much padding and is so easy to use. I like that the fabric is soft to the touch, becuase my son likes to rub his face on it.It is VERY convienient for the on-the-go mom. The knob you turn to tighten or loosen the harness straps makes it alot easier for getting your child in and out.. The instruction manual is easy to follow and lots of illustrations. That's GREAT for people like me who do not like to read.Yes, it is quite LARGE! It's worth the money."
2,"Just hope your kid never barfs,pees or spills in it....","The cover APPEARED to be removable for washing what with all the clips around the edges. However, we found that it is actually sewn to the seat and the straps are sewn together and that the cover does NOT come off!You would have to cut the straps or the cover to get it off.I will be contacting Evenflo and asking them for a new one that I can sew snaps on myself since the current cover now smells like sour milk permanantly. Some things just don't make sense! What parent has ever had a kid who NEVER made a stinky mess of some sort in the car seat!AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRHGGGGGGGGHHHHH!"
3,Not as pleased as I expected to be,"I read all of the reviews for this car seat and immediately ran out and bought it. It was not as good as expected. We had an extremely hard time installing it rear-facing (without LATCH - with seatbelt). I think the shoulder straps (double straps) are hard to get off and on and to adjust. I also just got back from a vacation and the carseat was destroyed going in the baggage hold of an airplane. Under the cloth seat is styrofoam (like a cooler) without any plastic to protect it. When we got the seat back from the luggage carrier, the styrofoam was cracked and laying in pieces inside the seat. The seat was useless. Our other daughter has a Costco Alpha-Omega and I think we'll replace this broken one with another of those."
3,Not that Impressed,"It was finally time to leave the infant car seat behind and embark on a mission to find the safest and most comfortable carseat for my 25lb, 9mth old baby. I searched high and low...spent hours reading reviews, searching the web,and took 3 trips to different stores in order to test every car seat on the market. Although I was a little hesitant about the quality, I was sold on its comfort. I was impressed by the instruction manual. It left nothing undsaid. I brought it home and I just couldn't get past the styrofoam. I know consumer reports gave it a high score but I plan on keeping this car seat for a while and I know that soon enough that styrofaom will crack (by moving it into different cars, child banging toys on it, dropping it, etc.) and would jeopordize the safety of that car seat. What good would it be then? I tell you what...this whole car seat mission is giving me nightmares!! I finally settled for the Graco Comfort Sport and am quite pleased with it. So is my daughter."
4,great for rear facing,This seat fits perfectly in my SUV and reclined to it's full correct position. After trying the alpha omega and taking it back after one day I purchased this and love it and baby loves it too! It is so easy to install (literally took about five minutes) because it comes fully assembled. The straps do tend to get a little twisted but its small problem to deal with because they seem to hold my five month old son nice and secure. The easy release latch is great for getting baby in and out of the car too. I would highly recommend this seat.
3,Make sure you check the padding,"We ordered our first Triumph 5 online and we have loved it since day one. Due to our satisfaction with the first, we decided to purchase a second one for our other car at Babies R Us. When I took the 2nd one out of the box, I was checking it out and noticed that it was really hard and uncomfortable. There was no foam between the car seat cover and the base. I went out to the car to look at our other one just to make sure it was ok, and it was very soft and comfortable. So, you may want to look over your carseat really good before you put your baby in it. I would have felt so bad if I hadn't noticed it first. I'm planning on returning it, and hopefully getting a new one that is as wonderful as our first."
4,INSTRUCTIONS?,"I just bought a new Triumph 5 (2 of them) opened the boxes to find no instructions. Is this normal? I am a first time Mom and want to be sure I do everything right to make it a safe ride for my almost 7 month old daughter. Is there anything I need to know? I rated it 4 stars because you have to call Evenflo for instructions, I just feel that with how much you are paying, they would include that."
5,Question,I recently purchased this based on the reviews I read here. So far so good. My son looks much more comfortable here than he did in his infant car seat. I do agree with the previous reviewer that the double straps on the shoulders seem a bit too much and hard to adjust but I guess that makes it even more safe and secure for our kids. Just a general question though - my son is very sensitive to light. It was nice when he was in his infant car seat that it had a sun shade. Wouldn't it be nice if the convertible car seats also had sun shades? I wonder why they don't install those on convertible car seats? Wonder if it's a safety hazard...
4,The only thing that stopped me from buying is the seat cover,"I have a nine month old son. I am considering buying the Evenflow Triumph 5 Comfort Touch Car Seat. I liked all the features. Last week I went to BRU to buy one. But, the only thing that stopped me from buying was the seat cover. On the display item, the plastic hooks(2 on bottom and 2 on the top) that keep the seat cover attached to the car seat were dangling from the cover, basically making 2 holes in the cloth. Looking at that, I backed off from buying the carseat. Did any of you had any problems with the cloth? Is it durable? I would greatly appreciate your response. Thanks in Advance."
5,Re: crotch strap lock,"Just a note about ...danger of the crotch strap lock. This was a concern for me, as my baby is young (5 months), but I discovered that there are two positions for the strap and the other besides the regular position, made the strap fit like it should and got it off of her tummy."
4,Finding the carseat directions,"I can't tell you how great the carseat is yet, b/c I haven't used it. Have 4 more weeks til our son is born! I just wanted to let people know how to find the directions on it. You look for the airbag warning label on the front, reach beneath the flap behind it, and there is a pocket on the other side. The directions are inside. I had read in the reviews on line that they were hard to find, and we had taken off the cover, and looked everywhere, but still missed that pocket. Had to call Evenflow. Maybe this will help other frustrated parents like us."
3,Cover is falling apart after 4 months!!!,I really like the car seat but I have only had it 4 months and the fabric cover is already falling apart! I called evenflo and they told me that the warrenty is only 90 days so I would be responsible for the replacement ($39.95). I don't think that is good customer service since I have only had the seat 4 months!
4,Baby loves it.,"We purchased this carseat after our baby outgrew his carrier. He loves it and falls asleep as soon as we start driving. He used to fuss when we put him in his carrier, but with this carseat he settles right in. We researched the carseats carefully and this one got great ratings from Consumer Reports. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that the seat is a little hard to secure. We had to use a towel to get it to fit correctly rear facing. The new ones are great and the straps are very convenient, but the state patrol officer that inspected it did check the year because of a recall. I read that some people thought that it was noisy to adjust, but you don't need to adjust it that often and not at all when you are removing the baby because of the way straps are designed. I definately recommend this car seat."
1,what they don't tell you!,"I purchased this carseat based upon its excellent reviews and moderate price. I took the carseat to a carseat installation service in my area, and as soon as the installer saw my backseat (Acura MDX) and the carseat I had purchased, she said, ""take it back."" Apparently this carseat cannot be placed in the middle of the backseat if your car has an armrest that folds down; it would have to be placed on either the left or right side. Since I only have 1 child, I wanted him to be placed in the middle. Apparently, this is the case with all Evenflo carseats if you have an armrest in the middle of your backseat. So, I returned this seat for the Britax Marathon."
1,Not recommended by car seat inspector,"We bought this car seat after a lot of research and decided that it was (on paper) just as good as the Britax. However, it isn't. The straps were difficult to adjust and once we had our son strapped in, the buckle rested right on his belly and the chest clip almost overlapped the buckle. Even the Babies R Us person working with us said he wouldn't buy it (we ignored him). So we took it back and bought the Britax Marathon. When I took it in to our local police to have it installed, I mentioned I had bought the Evenflo Triumph 5 before and the police officer said he would have told me to take it back -- he said that while all car seats meet safety regulations, they are not all equally safe or desirable. I'm glad I spent the money and bought the Britax."
2,Not a good investment,"I bought this when my son was eight months and 18.5 lbs. The straps are horrible, and the ""memory harness"" feature is a joke. I had to fight with the straps to get my son into the seat, much to his displeasure. Also, the stitching on the seat cover came undone within the first day of use! Not acceptable for such an expensive purchase!It was easy to install in the car, though so I'll give it credit for that. Maybe this car seat is fine for older children, but I had to return it after only a couple of days."
3,don't like the straps!,"I, too, liked the Evenflo Triumph 5 car seat, until my son got sick in it and I needed to completely remove the car seat cover and straps to wash it. Unbeknownst to me at the time of purchase, the straps CAN NOT be removed! I have purchased 7 car seats between my 2 sons, and this is the very first seat I have purchased that did not have removable straps!I spoke with Evenflo customer service reps twice and they were somewhat unsympathetic to my situation, just telling me to wipe the straps down and use a cotton swab to clean the buckles. If you have ever tried to ""spot clean"" this kind of mess, you know that this is pretty unrealistic.I give this product an unfavorable rating based solely on the unremovable straps and poor quality car seat fabric."
5,The best car seat for the $$$,I have an advantage of having the Britax Roundabout in my car and this car seat in my husbands...we started with this carseat in my car when my daughter was 5 months old...it is fabulous..it seems to cradle her whole body. She sleeps so well in it. I love how secure and tight it is when properly installed. Then my parents got the Britax as a gift for us..had I known they were getting us another carseat I would have asked for this one. The britax is great but this is even better and 1/2 the price...try your baby in it and they will love it. I would love to put this one back in my car..I just don't want to hurt my parents feelings...you can't go wrong with this one.A note on the crotch cover issue...it really is great in the hot texas wether...it toally covers my daughters little legs from hot metal
5,great value for money,"as far as car seats go, this one is pretty easy to install.Our 15-week-old boy seems pretty comfy in it (although, I do wish it could recline even further)The price is good & I love the fact that we can already use it for such a young baby (11 pounds)All in all, a great buy."
5,It Fits!!!!,"We have a 2001 ford F150 as the main transportation for our family and had no problems with the Eveflo Discovery infant seat. However, at the age of 5 months it became painfully obvious that our son neede a new car seat. Our main problem with finding a car seat was finding one that would comfortably fit in our truck without tipping our son forward due to the slant of the truck seat. After a couple of disastrous tries with other car seats( our son was practically kissing his own belly button) we decided to give this one a try. I had read other favorable reviews here which helped us with our decision. IT FIT!!!! Our son is so comfortable, I'm almost jealous!! I know others have said there were problems with the straps, but if you read the directions, it's not a problem. You don't have to spend a fortune either. Just because I don't want to have to re-mortgage my house to buy a car seat, doesn't mean I don't love my son! With this car seat you get safety & comfort for a reasonable price!!!"
4,As I expected,"Looking for a car seat was no easy task. Reading all the reviews I finally came to the decision of the Triumph 5. My 1 year old daughter finally grew out of her infant car seat and this one has been great. Easy to install. Fits great in my Corolla! A little on the heavy side, for changing to other cars, but not a huge issue. (just use to the infant carrier) I'm glad I decided on this one. My daughter likes it, very comfortable. I like the knobs allowing you to release and tighten the belts. I also like the way you only need to unlatch the fabric to put the seatbelt through. My hands are so small that I actually can just slip my hands through the slots without even having to unlatch the fabric.Great buythanksDopey3492"
1,Faulty design,"I registered for this car seat because it got great reviews but was half the cost of Britax. I returned this car seat before I installed it in my car. I had it out, ready for installation and decided to put my 3 month old in the seat to adjust the straps. (My son had grown out of his Peg Perego infant car seat at 2.5 months - but that's a different story.) Talk about a huge design flaw! The locking mechanism at the crotch is ridiculously big and positioned in such a way that it dug into my son's ribs. Granted my son is young (and a bit on the thin side), but this is supposed to be a converter seat which alleges to fit children as little as 5 pounds! I can't imagine where that lock would go if there is a car accident. I thought I was being overly paranoid, so I asked a friend of mine who has more experience and she thought the design was unsafe as well. I wound up purchasing the Britax and have been happy."
5,THE convertable car seat!,"We bought this seat a couple of weeks ago for our now 4 1/2 months old baby boy. He just looked so uncomfy in the infant carrier! We also considered a Britax, but after reading reviews we decided to try this one and as a plus it was on sale for $99. Our baby loves this seat, he is so comfy in it. We love it too, its easy to use and keeps baby safe and secure."
2,STRAP UNHAPPY,"This was my first of two so far for my 10 month old, 29-1/2"" long baby boy. The seat seemed to be comfy, but he cried whenever I tried to put him into it. The straps are the reason I took it back. I read the instructions and even emailed Evenflo to inquire on usage, but the time and effort to get them right just wasn't worth it anymore. His arms were hard to get out once he was in there. I felt the whole setup was too ""strappy"" with buckles and latches being everywhere. You must play with them before you buy to be sure you want to (can) adjust these while sitting in the back seat of car with a young one. It took a long time and was quite frustrating. I did purchase the Vanguard 5/Comfort Touch tonight and will be testing it this week. If all else fails, I'll be getting the Britax. Good luck!"
1,Recall Notice...,"I am researching car seats and was interested in this seat. I went to Evenflo.com and they have a recall for the Triumph. You need to get a free safety kit from Evenflo to help make this a safer seat. Go to Evenflo's website to see if this would apply to you. I'm not sure if there are different models of the Triumph, but I wanted to let everyone know. I haven't decided against this seat (the reviews are great), but I marked this with a 1 star to get people's attention. Hope this info is helpful."
2,OUTGROWING IT AT 6 MONTHS!!,"I just bought this seat for my 6 month old and I am taking it back. I had taken him to the BRU store and this one was by far the one he fit best in and with most comfort. The problem is his shoulders are about as high as they can go for the 2nd of 3 shoulder heights available. I didn't think that was a problem at the store since he had plenty of room till the third one -- However, when I read the instructions, I found out I can't put it in the 3rd height until he is forward facing - another 6 months! I don't think he is going to stop growing for the next six months, so I have to take it back. I really hate this because I loved the comfort and user-friendly design, which none of the others seem to come close to. I think I am going to get the Century 1500 STE for $$, since it ranked well safety-wise and I saw no really big differences in the rest of the seats."
2,Loved it...until it broke...,I've had the evenflo triumph 5 for 2 years...it is easily installed and the straps adjust easily from the front (big plus). I was thrilled until the crotch buckle started to stick...I thought I wouldn't be able to get it buckled at all and then upon arriving home I could not get my daughter out of the seat...I had to make the straps as loose as possible and slide her out. Worst of all Evenflo says that it is past the 60 day warranty and will not replace the carseat and they say the buckle is not replaceable. I am angered by evenflo's refusal to back their product.
2,hard to install,"This seat was highly recommended by the Baby Bargains Book, but we found it impossible to tighten the LATCH straps. My husband is a strong man, and I am not small, so if he can't tighten it when I am sitting in it...well. We went with a Marathon instead, and we love it! Very easy to strap DS in, and get him out."
4,awsome,this carseat is very good in handing my brother loves to sit in it. he looks so cute when he is sitting in it. he loves to sit in it. it feels very comfortable and he is so attatched to it. the colours are very nice on the carseat.
2,"terrible straps, not easy to loosen or tighten",we have a britax and this car seat and for the money buy the britax. the straps are terribleon the evenflo and not easy to use and the buckle seems like it is uncomortable for my son. the britax is much better and well worth the money- we are trying to return our evenflo!
1,JUST TRY TO CLEAN IT,I LOVED THIS CAR SEAT UP UNTIL TODAY. EVERYTHING ABOUT IT THAT IS WOUNDERFUL IS CANCELLED OUT BY THE MANNER YOU HAVE TO CLEAN IT. THERE IS NO EASE IN THIS PROCESS THE STRAPS DO NOT COME OFF. ALSO YOU NEED A SCREW DRIVER TO REMOVE SCREWS TO GET THE COVER OFF. FOUR OF THEM !! SO MY ADVICE IS IF YOU ARE EVER GOING TO PUT YOUR CHILD IN IT YOU BETTER NOT BUY IT. OVER AN HOUR SPENT CLEANING IT AFTER MY DAUGHTER GOT SICK IN IT.
2,"Easy Install, But Hard to Remove Child","This seat was the second one I purchased for my five month old son. I was thrilled when I installed it because it was quite easy to do. However, when my son was in the seat, I found the crank to tighten the belts to be very loud, sometimes waking him from sleep. Also, loosening the belt was difficult as the button that had to be pushed would not always disengage the seatbelts. One time, my husband and I couldn't get the belts loosened for almost 5 minutes. What if there had been an emergency and we needed to get our son out quickly? We marched right back to the store, returned it, and spent the extra money on a Britax, which installed easily, is comfortable for my son, and is easy to operate."
4,kwalla,"I love this carseat. It is very easy to get my child in and out of this seat. I have had no problems with adjusting the straps to fit my child. (Some of the other reviews suggested that that was a problem.) We have an SUV and a sedan. In the SUV, the bar to turn the straps is easy to get to. However in the sedan, I have to reach across my child and tighten the straps from the opposite side, because the bar was buried in the seat on the side nearest the door. This is the only problem I have encountered with this carseat. I would recommend this carseat to anyone."
2,poor design,"This seat did not work in either of our cars in the rear facing position. Our seats have a flared edge for lateral support and the way the harness fastening knob is designed, it is embedded in the seat cushion so you cannot get your fingers in to adjust it. When we tried to put in the center of the seat, we couldn't get it tight enough to keep from moving sideways. It might work with a latch system but we don't have one. It is also very heavy also. The harness system has overlapping straps so it can be confusing at first ""which hole"" to put the babies arms through. I will say that it is a comfortable seat for the baby. If you only need it for forward facing it might be a good seat because it did get rated well for safety. We bought the Britax Roundabout and like it a lot better- its much easier to install, more secure and much light."
2,What a mess this seat is,"Not only is it difficult to adjust in the rear-facing configuration, but it is near impossible to keep the straps from dangerously twisting in the retention mechanism. We have two different seats for two different vehicles, and I have never had the kind of trouble with the other seat. If I had a do-over, I would not have purchased this seat."
4,GREAT seat!,"My daughter LOVES this carseat, it is so comfortable!it reclines a lot and the straps are so easy to move.The only thing i didnt like was that she is between the first adjustment and second, the second being a little too high over her shoulders and the first way too low. With winter we have to go with the second.but other than that it was fairly easy to install and the second I put her in it she stops crying.I think its a great buy for the money!"
2,If the belt release was only 1 inch back,I really liked this seat But I put it in my 2002 town and country (rear facing and the belt release was hitting the back of my seat I could not tighten the belt because there was not enough room.It was a very soft seat and it didi have a lot of room.I did have to take it back but I would try it in your car!!
4,Much better than Victory 5 seat,"I just returned my Evenflo Victory 5 seat (which was horrible) and paid the extra money for this Triumph 5 seat. It's so much better -- more plush padding, MUCH easier straps. I returned the Victory because the leg straps didn't adjust and dug into my small infant's legs. The Triumph adjusts much easier and feels all around safer for her. Yes, it is bigger and heavier, but I have a mini-van and don't have the same problem others have in the smaller cars. Definately worth the money, and a huge improvement over the Victory 5 seat that I quickly returned. I really like the Triumph. The instruction booklet is hidden in the seat (why??I don't know...), and I had to look up online where to even find it. But, honestly, my husband and I got our baby into it and adjusted correctly without the booklet, anyways.Good seat!"
3,"Great in warmer months, not so great in colder months.....","I have a rather tall 21 month old and she has been using this carseat since about 10 months with no problems. We loved using this seat as it was comfortable for my daughter both rear facing and forward facing, was easy to use, never had problems with twisted straps. We overall were happy with this seat. HOWEVER, as the months get colder and she had to wear a winter coat or jacket, it was very difficult to strap her in and lock the buckle and is now pulling on her shoulders and this is with the strap at the highest position. I am already now looking for a new carseat as I just cannot keep her in this with her winter coat.As I said I enjoyed the use of it during the warmer months, but now 11 months later I am looking for a new carseat. Luckily I am expecting another child and will be able to get more use out of the seat.I would have given it 5 stars IF they added a longer strap, then I wouldn't be in this situation...."
5,Awesome seat,"I purchased this seat after witnessing a friend's daughter in the same seat. I was apprehensive about the strap adjustment, but as one reviewer said, if you read how to adjust the straps, it is simple. It is easy to get my daughter in and out of this seat and she falls asleep easily as other people mentioned. Overall, I think this seat is a bargain compared to the other Britax seats. I would recommend this seat to anyone. Only one problem that I've encountered was with the latch system. The strap is not quite long enough and is difficult to get the seat in and out quickly, but at least it is extremely tight in the car. Oh yeah, and I have a Honda Civic also--no problem fitting it in."
2,Should have gotten the Britax,I purchased this car seat for my 18 month old son. I researched and liked what information I could find on this product. Once I got it home I was very unhappy. First of all it weighs a TON! Not recommended if you need to use it for 2 cars. It is wide which is comfy for the rider but if you have a small car it is going to be a tight squeeze if there are other passengers. Especially if there are other carseats/boosters that need to be used. I have an Expedition and 2 other sons in boosters and it is quite a feat getting them all in the second row. The straps take a bit getting used to and to try to recline it is a nightmare. Lastly to wash the cover requires a screwdriver to remove the back to be able to take it off. Our fourth son has just arrived and when he is ready for a forward-facing seat he will be getting a Britax model.
3,It was great until it's first bath!!!,"I bought this car seat about a year ago for my then 1 yr old son. Like many other parents I researched the top picks and finally decided on this seat. It was all great until the first time my son got sick in it and I had to wash it. Not only did it take an act of congress (and a screwdriver) to get the seat cover off of the seat, but once I washed it, the backing where the velcro was thinned out and eventually ripped. This then led to my son pulling out the filling which I would find all over my van. One would think after spending $122 on a carseat it would last more than a few washings (and survive that of a toddler boy)! So, in the mean time it is in the garage until my new baby girl is old enough to use it and it has been rehabed by the filling fairy. We ended up using another Evenflo carseat that I found on clearance at Wal-Mart for $35."
5,BEST CAR SEAT!!!!!!!!!,A parents worst nightmare happened to me just two days ago. A woman ran a stop sign and plowed into the left side of my car going between 45 and 50 mph. She hit the side of my car that the infant seat was on. The whole frame of the car is bent in and the doors are smashed in. The door pushed into the car seat and my little one got jostled around quite a bit. Thanks to the fabulous padding on the sides of the car seat and the strength of the heavy car seat my baby only has a slight bruise on her thigh. The injuries could have been so much worse. Thank the Lord that we had that wonderful car seat! My husband is going back to the store to purchase another one just the same right now. (because after a crash they always tell you to replace the car seat because the integrity might be compromised)
3,Wonderful carseat.... needs some improvements.,"I really like most of the features on this car seat! I love the recline, and the cushiness of the fabric. I also like that you can release the seatbelt to loosen it to get your baby out. I had a few small problems though.. One, with the clips that hold the fabric down in the front, one of them broke off. Also,I don't like the fact that you had to take the fabric on and off to get the seatbelt through the bottom or back to strap it in. I don't like that this carseat is so wide. I have a 4Runner, and when it is placed forward facing in the middle rear seat, you don't have shoulder room for the other two passengers. I also don't like that the fabric is velcroed in the front all around it. As you put your baby in and get him out, it kind of pulls at the velcro. Also, my baby likes to pull at them while he is in the seat. I hope this is helpfull to anyone."
2,Weird Straps,"We got this car seat as our second with the Britax Roundabout being the other one. Although the Triumph 5 is wide and rather comfy, the straps are ridiculously difficult. As far as I can tell, it is the only carseat to have double straps from the crotch latch up to the shoulders. What a pain. When we tried to tighten, only the lower or upper strap would tighten leaving the other one loose and sometimes falling down off the babies shoulders. Also putting him in was difficult. His arms would get split between the double layer of straps. Realizing I would need to deal with this seat for several years, I have decided to return it to get another Roundabout. Only $169 on babyage.com and it can be used up to 40 lbs. Much, much easier to use."
5,Worth the money - very easy to operate!,"This is such a great car seat! The Triumph is the easiest car seat I have bought so far. It's very soft, and seems comfortable. The straps stay flat (untangled) for the 5 point harness. The adjustments are super easy to use -- both the harness tightning adj. and the recline. Very important. This is the car seat that I have used ever since my son grew out of his first carseat (w/ travel system) -- he is now 22 months old, 29 pounds, and the seat is still working great. I highly recommend this seat. I was deciding between the Britax ($200.00) seat and the Triumph -- the Triumph seemed way more comfy and easier to use. My mom had bought the Cosco Omega Seat w/ the bar in front --what a hassle -- and SUPER heavy. The Triumph seat is easy to transfer - lightweight. This seat is so worth the money!"
5,"IF ""PLEASE READ THIS"" SCARED YOU","If ""please read this"" review scared you, check out Consumer Reports. You can veiw the car seat ratings for free on their website. This one is in the Convertible category and is tied for second place. It scored all excellents in the Crash protection category and was the only Convertible seat to do that. I don't know about you but I trust Consumer Reports."
4,A Happy Mama,"I researched and debated for weeks between this seat and the Britax. I decided on this seat and am very happy with my decision! I feel that I still get lots of ""extras"" (easy to adjust straps, non-twisting straps, lots of padding, good looking, etc) as well as safety, without the ...pricetag. It fits perfectly in my Honda Accord and my 7-month-old son loves it! I use it with the seatbelt because my car is not LATCH equipped and it is very secure. I didn't give it 5 stars because it only has the helmet foam on the sides, unlike the Britax which has it along the whole torso. Overall, I highly recommend this seat if you are unwilling/unable to pay for the Britax."
2,Seat is too heavy and big,"I liked the side strap adjustments on this seat, however this seat is extremely heavy. Do not buy if you plan to move from car to car. I could not tighten the latch enough to keep the car seat from sliding, using the seat belt was worse(maybe because I have leather car seats?). It also did not fit well in my Ford Focus Sedan. I returned it for the new britax marathon with latch. The britax fits my car perfectly and does not move at all. The latch on the britax is much easier to use, but of course you get what you pay for."
5,My daughter loves it!!!,"My husband and I have been checking out convertible seats since our daughter was 4 months and we could see she would soon outgrow her infant carrier/car seat. We were all set to go with the Cosco Alpha Omega when we learned it had failed some safety tests. We were happy with our Evenflo Cozy Carry infant seat so we checked out their convertible seats. We really liked the Triumph 5 for price and it's many features. I especially like the tension knobs, it is much easier to tighten her in and she doesn't fuss. She is only 5 months, and can still use her carrier, but we are using this already because she seems so much more comfortable in it. She falls asleep easily and her head doesn't fall forward, she's nestled in the seat comfortably."
5,I love this seat!!,This car seat is awesome and the price is great too. The straps have never gotton tangled for me which I know is a concern on some car seats. Buckling my daughter in is easy. I recommend comparing buckles on car seats b/c some buckles have to be held together to buckle which is a pain. I really like the way the car seat looks and feels. I bought the black one and it doesn't get hot like you might think the black material would.This really secures my daughter and her head doesn't flop when she's sleeping because it has cushion on either side of her head.
2,Not for newborns!!!,"I bought this seat when a coworker highly recommended it after using it with her toddler, and after I read the great safety reviews in several respected consumer journals. I thought I was saving money by having one seat that we could use until my son was over 40 pounds. I was very disappointed on the day my husband and I brought our son home from the hospital and found that it forced his head downward toward his chest in the rear-facing position because newborns haven't developed enough head control to hold their head up on their own yet. We had the seat inspected, so we are certain it was installed properly; it just doesn't work for a newborn. We kept it to use later after he outgrows the carrier system we had to buy to replace this one. My advice: buy a carrier system from the beginning and it will save you money and frustration."
2,Great looking product but...,"My wife and I did an extreme amount of research on this carseat and were quite impressed with it's ratings and reviews, so we purchased it. After installing the seat we noticed right away while driving around the noise from the seat was going to drive us insane. The carseat while having good safety ratings and a great appearance shakes and rattles so annoyingly while going down the road we couldn't stand it. We had to unfortunately return the seat. It seems due to it's ability to adjust so much it has more moving parts creating the noise factor."
1,My Triumph broke after 11 days,"...After deciding on the Triumph 5 Comfort Touch, I went to Toys R Us and was very pleased initially with the seat. I did have the salesperson help me carry it out and install it due to the heavier weight. I'm not that small, but I couldn't imagine trying to travel with this seat on the airplane. I did however rationalize that this extra weight would add to the seats overall safety.After driving me crazy for the last week, the adjustment knob finally broke and now I can no longer tighten the straps. I called Evenflo's Customer Service Department (if you want to call it that) and was put on hold for over 20 minutes before the rep came on the line and concluded that the gearing was most likely stripped and was not caused by user error - Me! I had called Evenflo earlier in the week to verify I was indeed using the adjustments correctly. ..."
3,No instructions=bad Evenflo,"Just got the seat, like alright but it didn't come with instructions. Whata pain trying to deal with Toysrus to try to get them. I am taking this back...bad evenflo :("
1,DO NOT BUY ONLINE,"I would definately not buy this seat online. I had decided to purchase it after researching it online, and went into the store to check it out. (It has the second highest safety ratings as well as being recommended by other parents and Consumer Reports) As soon as I put my hand into the seat and realized that there was NO padding under the fabric, I put it back and walked away. There is NO WAY an infant will sleep or even ride comfortably with no padding under his or her bottom. I bought the Britax Marathon, and after the initial ""sticker shock"" am completely in love with it."
2,Dangerous Material,"We where all set to go on purchasing this car seat. I loved everything about it, and thought it was a very well made seat. Boy was I wrong! While I was talking to the salesperson at Toys r us my husband started taking the padding off to check out the material. Underneath the cushion of the arm rest is styrofoam. He pulled it off even more to reveal its mostly made of this stuff. I just know that my child would eventually peel back the cover and have a great time of breaking apart a very expensive, and large packing peanut. Not only would it be messy, but also extremely dangerous. I wouldn't be surprised if the Triumph Five gets recalled because of this.Mother of two ""Alison"""
2,Am I doing this wrong?? ...,"I bought 2 of these for my 7 month old twins when they outgrew infant carriers..(one is still in a 5-40 lb. rear facing carrier ""type"" seat ..... I thought this looked SO comfy...when I put either of them in it, they look like they are slumped down, folded up!For the shoulder straps, they are right between the 2 levels....it seems like the straps are pushing then down in the seat and then the crotch strap WILL not stay in the postion closest to them.I LOVE this seat and it was a great price......."
1,not for a toddler,i gave this seat one star because it is comfortable. but putting it together was not easy. also i dont know why evenflow uses so much velcro on all their products. my 16 month old just takes everything apart since its so easy for her with the velcro. also the foam on this carseat just doesnt make sense to me. my daughter picks at it for the whole car ride and now each side of the car seat has deep holes where she has been picking.. and my car is full of little white styrofoam!! i wouldnt recommend this seat for a toddler who gets into everything.
5,This car seat is worth every penny and more!!,"I was all set to buy the Britax roundabout carseat. I went to BRU and the salesman suggested the Triumph to me. He told me that it was just as good as the Britax but at a better price. I tried my daughter in both car seats. She seemed to be comfortable in the Triumph so I decided to give it a try. It was easy to install in my car and fit well rear facing. I love how easy it is to fix the straps. It is just a quick push on the lever to loosen and a twist of the knob to tighten. It reclines far back enough so my daughter can sleep without hurting her neck. I also love the styrofom. Moms, that helps to absorb shock during an accident. The only flaws are that the directions are a little hard to find and I also think that the straps do take time to get used to. Once you understand how to work the straps, though, it is a breeze. Moms, if you were going to go for the Britax like me, save your money here and buy this safe, comfortable carseat!"
4,Great carseat with a great price!,"I had done my research and reviewed several carseats and had my heart set on the Britax Roundabout carseat. I went to BRU and the sales person refered me to the Triumph. He explained to me that it had the same benefits as the Britax Roundabout but had a better price. After putting my daughter in both seats, she loved the Triumph. She did not cry nor fuss. It fits great in my car and the harness system works well. My daughter is very comfortable in the seat and it reclines when rear facing so that my daughter will be able to sleep easily on long rides. The reason I gave this four stars rather than five is that the directions were hard to find, and the seat covering is hard to take off to clean. Other than that, I feel very secure with this carseat and so does my daughter. The money saved on this carseat is also a great bonus too!!!!!"
5,Good Seat!,"We have this seat in my husband's Avalanche. It's great for babies from 20-40 lbs. For an average sized baby, that's from about 12 months to 36 months. It's soft enough to keep her comfortable and it's easy to use. The material is durable and doesn't show dirt easily. It's just overall a good chair and reasonably priced!"
5,Great Car Seat,"I purchased this car seat after reading reviews on this website when my son was 9 months old and 20 lbs. It fit perfectly in my 2002 Nissan Altima and took only a few minutes to put in with the LATCH system. My son is now 22 months (30 lbs) and I still love this car seat. It is so easy to adjust the straps depending on what he is wearing. The straps have never twisted and the cover still looks brand new. He is always content when we are in the car and I believe that is because he is so comfortable. I would definitely recommend this car seat to anyone. Especially since we bought a cheaper model for my husband's car and the straps get so twisted that I can hardly get my child in them. It is nice to be able to put him in quickly and go, knowing that he is comfortable and happy."
1,CHOKING HAZARD!,"I loved this car seat until a month ago. My six month old loves to play with things in her hands. When she is in her car seat, she grabs and plays with a corner of her car seat cover. Three or four weeks ago, I discovered that she split opened her car seat cover and was grabbing chunks of the filling. I immediately returned the car seat and replaced it with another Triumph 5. I thought my first Triumph 5 was simply a defect and a new seat would solve the problem. Well, I was wrong. This weekend I discovered the same problem appearing again in the car seat cover. Obviously, the material used to construct the backside of this car seat cover is cheap enough to where a six month old is able to slowly tear it apart. This car seat needs to be recalled before a baby chokes to death."
4,Excellent,"This seat is very easy to install, especially if you use the LATCH system. It feels quite sturdy, and stays in place. The seat is VERY plush and comfortable for my baby. It's easy to recline, and to adjust the harness. The seat is quite large and heavy to lug around, but I feel my baby is safe and secure. It received an excellent rating in Consumer Reports, and is priced well."
5,"Love it, easy to use`","I love this seat. I have an 2002 Chevy Impala, and it is very easy to get my 14 month son out of the seat. We have had this seat since my son was 5.5 months old, so we used it rear facing as well! Very easy to adjust with my son in it. My only complaint, it seems like a PITA to take it apart to have to wash it when it needs it. However it does dry fast and isn't hard to reinstall."
4,Very happy with this car seat,"We bought this car seat because our 4 month old daughter was starting to get uncomfortable in her infant seat. We planned to use the bigger car seat for longer trips for now and then continue using it when she outgrows her infant seat. I found the seat extremely easy to install - it only took us about 10 minutes. It is a little heavy, but we bought one seat for each car, so we don't plan to move it around much. Most importantly - our daughter was very happy in this seat for our recent nine hour car ride! I would recommend this to anyone - good safety ratings, but not as expensive as Britax seats."
4,Very Happy with Car Seat,"We purchased this car seat about 2 years ago, and overall we've been very happy with the car seat. Our son is very big for his age and he fits comfortably in this seat. The only two issues I have with the seat is that the straps are a little hard to adjust, and it's not that convenient to clean. We've taken 8 hour road trips and also traveled out of the country with this car seat, and didn't get any complaints from our son.Mother of ""Big Boy""."
5,Love This Carseat!,"My daughter outgrew her Peg Perego at 4 months, so off to Babies R Us we went. I read the reviews on all the carseats that the store offered, and decided to check out the Graco ComfortSport and the Evenflo Triumph 5. I went home with the Graco - BIG MISTAKE (see my review on the Graco). I took it back and bought the Evenflo. What a difference! This is a great carseat! It's easy to use and cradles my daughter like the Peg Perego did. She can't sit up on her own yet, so the reclining feature is perfect. As the other reviews of this carseat state, the strap release/tighten feature is wonderful. No more crushing my hand between the backseat and the carseat to tighten the straps!This is a worthwhile purchase (and 1/2 the price of a Britax)"
3,Difficult to use,We bought this seat because it received a good crash test rating from consumer reports. The harness is difficult to use and the release button often requires two hands. We returned it and got the Britax Wizard - what an awesome seat!
4,Great Seat! NOT FOR AIRPLANES!!!,"Yes, it is approved by the FAA, but it is too large to fit in regular coach airline seats! So unless you and your baby want to travel business or coach class, you'll need a different car seat for the plane.HOWEVER, as a day to day carseat, this is my FAVORITE!!!! There is no better seat on the market and we have tried them all! I have a Cosco Alpha-Omega Elite for plane rides and my husband's car, but this is by far the preferred seat. We are still only rear facing at this point, but have used this seat for countless other children for doctor's visits and road trips when our son wasn't using it. It's easy to install, simple to operate, and the ONLY seat on the market that's easy to adjust the straps on every time since they are on the side and not on the front. So even when you're child's rear-facing, you can go from snowsuit setting to shorts in just seconds! I love this seat and wouldn't get rid of it for the world."
2,Love this but there is a safety issue,"We purchased this seat after a long decision making process and absolutley loved it our son fit great and seemed comfortable and it was easy to install. BUT after 5 months of use and the curiousity of our now toddler son, We discovered a dangerous safety concern. The side arm covers are easily lifted and our son discovered the styrofoam under them and has eaten a large quantity of it. When I contacted Evenflo they offered to send me new styrofoam to replace what he had eaten, and told me to give him a toy to remove his attention.Like I havent tried that The elastic is easy to lift and a toddlers persistance will not stop the issue. We are now purchasing a new seat! PLEASE BE AWARE THIS SEAT IS DANGEROUS!!!"
1,Faulty Seat Pad Cover,"After four short months of use, my sons seat pad cover clips have fallen off. ... I am not thrilled with the quality of the product."
5,"By far, the best carseat","I've tried so many carseats and am astounded at how much better the Titan 5 is compared to the rest. Our first carseat was the infant carrier from our Evenflo Comfort Series Plus system. My daughter cried non-stop while she was in it. Worse than that was when the stupid base broke as I was tightening the seatbelt! Next, I tried another Evenflow that has an arm that comes over (it's only a 3 point system) and found my daughter sleeping with her face resting on the bar - not safe in a collision in my opinion. I then took her to the store and put her into several carseats. This Titan 5 stood out because it was more padded. An even bigger advantage is the fact that the belts are super easy to adjust. She loves it - well, she at least tolerates it. It's installed behind the driver's seat in a Chevy Blazer and since I'm short, it fits just fine. I fully recommend this seat."
3,Is this seat too short? Need advice.,"I went today to look at convertible car seats and while this one got rave reviews, it looks really small? Does it adjust to make it taller? I want a seat that will last and I was afraid that if my daugher is tall it would not be tall enough. I'm considering this one or the Graco comfortsport as it has a high back.And what about the velcro cover? Is it a pain? Does it come undone often? It did not seem to stick well in the store?Help - advice anyone?"
2,You get what you pay for and this seat is not a Britax.,"We bought this as a second car seat for my husband's car. The buttons to loosen the straps on the seat dig into the seat of his car and, therefore, are very hard to press. The straps constantly get tangled. It is also very difficult to put a child that is bundled up in this seat even when you finally get the straps loosened. We have not had these problems with our Britax Marathon seat."
5,great purchase,"We just purchased this carseat for our 8 month old. I installed it using the LATCH system. I found it easy to install and after a test drive it proved to be easy and seemed to be very comfortable to my son. The knobs for adjusting the harness are an added bonus. Everyone seems to want to compare this seat to the Britax, you have to realize there is over 100.00 dollars difference in the price. How much better could it be? Does it put the baby in the seat and fasten him/her in for you??"
2,You can do better for the money!,"I initially loved this car seat. I bought it when my daughter outgrew her infant carseat. I liked the fact that this could be installed in both rear facing and then forward facing when she was older.That said, the problems with it make it not worth the money! First of all, the cover is not removable so you can't wash it. Trust me, this will matter! In desperation I took it outside and scrubbed it down with soap and the water hose. That was a mess and it never really got clean.Second, the strap system broke almost at once. I can neither tighten nor loosen the straps. They're frozen in place. I'm back online shopping for a new car seat today less than a year after I bought this one. Save your money and don't make the same mistake I did!"
5,B Martin,I love this car seat! Easy to clean and install! I have told other parents about this GREAT car seat at school! Wish more car seat products were so easy to adjust going from coat to shirt weather in NH. Worth every penny!
1,Horrible Car Seat,We bought this car seat to use in our second car due to the safety ratings and reviews. It was a big mistake. The release mechanism for the shoulder straps is extremely difficult. Our daughter also found this car seat uncomfortable. We have a Britax Roundabout as my daughter's main car seat. I would rather spend the extra money on a Britax for a second car seat than put our daughter in the Evenflo Triumph car seat.
2,Cover does not fit after one washing,"I, also loved the carseat UNTIL my daughter got sick in it. It took a long time to take off the cover. After washing it, it never fit on the right way again not to mention that the velcro that holds the head rest nolonger works. The straps still smell, no matter what I spray on them.The car seat, in the store and until my daughter got sick, had everything I was looking for; the strap tightener in front, a reclining position while forward facing (most forward facing seats are not supposed to recline, this and Britax are the only ones I,ve found that you can use the recline position when it is facing forward -- this is very important to me, because we do go on long trips)and a safe car seat. This seamed perfect, it has the same design as Britax for less $. BIG mistake I should have purchased the Britax.I wish I had read some reviews before purchasing this seat."
5,I got two for my twins!,I love this carseat!! It is really east to install and has extra foam on the sides for my babies protection. Since they can't ride in the middle we really need it!I just can't say enough good things about this carseat!
2,The Foam Breaks!,"I purchased the Evenflo comfort carseat last October and returned it in January when it broke. At first I loved the seat, it was roomy and fit nicely in my small car. The biggest downfall at that time was that you couldn't turn the knobs in the rear facing position. At Christmas we flew with the car seat and checked the seat with our luggage. When we got home I noticed that the foam under the padding was all cracked and broken. I called Evenflo to ask if it could be replaced and they said no and that the seat was now no good. Luckily Babies R Us allowed me to return the seat and purchase another one. I have to wonder if a carseat can break going through baggage what would happen in an accident? As a matter of fact, I was in an acident last week and was glad my child was not in the Comfort Touch seat. I should add that my seat was one of the first ones made and did not have the latch. Perhaps evenflo has made improvements?"
3,Straps no longer fit around my 23-pound son,"We bought this seat based on the combined comfort, safety and price. For the first several months my son was in it, we really loved it - it fastens securely via the Latch system and he seemed to be very comfortable in it. But now he's 23 pounds and wearing a winter coat and the straps won't adjust to fit him anymore. It's a struggle every time we put him in or take him out to get the buckle & clips secured. I think the seat is rated for up to 40 pounds, but there's no way it's going to get past 25-30 pounds in reality. The strap adjustment feature looks simple, but is very difficult to master. I really like the seat, but I'm really mad that it doesn't comfortably fit my son anymore. I'd take it back tomorrow if I could."
2,Go with a Britax instead....,"I first bought this for my daughter after she grew out of her (Graco snug ride) and it was great at first but sooner or later I had problems with it. First problem was the straps always got tangled. Second it was not comfortable for my daughter. The third problem was when I tried to put the seat belt through rear facing the plastic inserts would always move out of place. The worst problem I had was the seat would move and tilt when I made a turn since it was top heavy, in my (97 Pontiac GrandAm). That to me did not look right safety wise. So when I had enough money I purchased the Britax Marathon after two other carseats I tried. Trust me it is worth every penny. My new seat does not tilt due to having side locking clips on each side."
4,Great for Bigger Babies,"I'm the mother or a large baby (12lb at birth). When my daughter grew out of her infant carrier at 7 months I had to find a seat that was big enough for her to grow in. There are few seats available with high safety ratings that will accommodate a larger child. This one is great. We actually tried a smaller seat and found that she was very fussy and fidgety when we were in the car. When we switched to the Triumph 5, car rides got a lot easier. I only have one seat so we are always transfering it from vehicle to vehicle and it's a breeze with the Triumph 5. It's also very easy to get her in and out of. We just turned it front-facing and it's even easier!"
2,Wouldn't purchase again,We purchased this seat when our daughter was 4 months old. We thought it was a little difficult to install. I dislike that you have to take it all apart if you need to wash the padding. Our daughter was also able to tear a hole in the back side of the padding and had a handful of stuffing ready to stuff in her mouth!! My sister-in-law had to do some sewing and modify that backside of the padding to prevent further ripping. I would probably not purchase this car seat again. My daughter also seems uncomfortable when she is in it.
2,Impressed by reviews and disappointed,"My son who is now 11 months old has outgrown his infant carrier due to the height limitations. At 18 lbs and 28 1/2 inches long he is small for his ageI began looking for a new car seat and read all of the wonderful reviews on this seat.I ran out to purchase 2 of them and became quite disappointedThis seat is just to complicated to workThe chest clip is huge and makes my little guy quite uncomfortable when its buckledThe straps are a huge pain to tighten and loosen with those crazy knobsNot to mention we couldnt get it to fit properly in our vehs (blazer and grand am)We ended up going back and getting the Graco comfortsport and it does not have all the ""high tech"" stuff on it making it simpler to useit also fits my son betterMake sure to take your baby with you when you are shopping for seats because one size does not fit all !!"
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"This seat is okay at best. Glad I bought it as a second car seat for gramma's car and not our primary one. Thought it looked easy to install, but wasn't. I even had the help of a trained installer and it took both of us plus a call to Evenflo to get it in correctly. She also pointed out that the seat back is not very tall, so babies will probably outgrow the seat in height (which is not safe) before they ever reach the weight/age requirement to go to the booster. Invest a little more and get a better seat. Would have sent it back but had already thrown out the box."
5,SAVED MY BABIES LIFE!!!!!!,I love this carseat!!!! It is so easy to get your child in and out of. I was recently in a severe car wreck when a car ran out in front of me. I hit the car head on going 65 miles per hour. My daughter had a scratch on her neck from the strap and that is it. This carseat saved her life and I would recommend everyone use this for your precious little one.
4,"As good as Britax, half the price","After a lot of careful research, I chose this carseat (times two for my twins...if you buy at [a physical store] ask for your twin discount!) because like the Britax Roundabout it has energy absorbing foam and the upper seat secure strap to keep the head from flying forward in a crash. Excellent quality but it costs HALF what the Britax is. My only reason for going four stars is that I find the over-the-shoulder straps to be somewhat difficult to adjust because they double-up and it's hard to get it just right it seems. But the simple adjuster knob really does help."
4,Best car seat ever!,I have only found one minor problem with this car seat and that is that it is a pain to transfer from one car to another (which I dont have to do often)but other than that it is the best! I would not trade it for any other car seat. My son was 8 mons old and 25 pounds when we got it and he is very comfortable and loves all the room. I love that it will tilt back if he is sleeping so his head wont bobble around.He always falls asleep because he is so comfortable. And I love that its just one turn of a knob to loosen or tighten the shoulder straps!
2,La traducción no rima,"Me decepcioné al ver que la versión en castellano no rimaba, que es la gracia de los libros del dr Seuss. Quizás serviría como para aprender inglés, pero la historia también es media fome"
2,Unaceptable translation,"Not only am I a Spanish native speaker but I am a college instructor teaching Spanish language and literature. I really wanted my kids to have both versions of the story since they are being raised bilingually. However, to my dismay, the Spanish translation is an awful, pathetic, literal one, totally lacking any cultural interest and not to mention the rhyme. We also own ""Un pez, dos peces..."" and the translator an Aida Something did the most amazing job.The only reason why I give 2 stars instead of 1 is that at least we have the English version and that's definitely the one I am reading to my kids. I am not poissoning their ears with a made up Spanish with a lot of unforgivable mistakes."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"There can never ever ever be an excuse for a book so poorly translated. The only way the publisher (Random House, I think) will get the message that this book should be republished with suitable translation is for reviews like this (and others here) to proliferate and for no more of these books to be sold...ever. Don't buy it for friends (or their kids). Don't let friends buy it for you (or your kids). The translation is AWFUL. There are so many other Dr. Seuss books that have been brilliantly translated: Mulberry St / Green Eggs and Ham / One Fish Two Fish / Horton Hears a Who / The Grinch Stole Christmas. Buy those. And pray pray pray that Random House gets the message and takes time to publish a proper translation of this otherwise great great classic."
1,Teacher's two thumbs down,"The translation of this book is horrible! It is literally translated and doesn't even rhyme. Dr. Seuss would be very disappointed!!!Try ""Huevos verdes con jamón""."
1,El gato en el sombrero/The Cat in The Hat,When I first bought this book in Spanish (many years ago) the translation was so awful that I wrote the publishers begging them to improve future editions. I recently saw the book again and not a word has been changed-it's still a abomination.
2,I agree with Ms. Denise Caramagno,"The spanish version of this book is pathetic. We also have ""Huevos verdes con jamon"" (Green eggs with ham) in spanish and it is delighful to read it.At least, in this edition you still have the english version to read.I think this book needs a re-edition with a more accurate translation."
1,Losing the rhyme is a crime...,"A literal translation of Cat in the Hat does great damage to Dr. Seuss' original idea to teach children how to read. The Spanish version does not accomplish the goal. It contains little or no rhyme, uses words beyond a beginning reader's level, and does not entice the child to read the book in spanish."
2,El Gato Cabizbajo,"The literal, word-for-word translation destroys the flavor and fun of this classic. See Aida Marcuse's translations to see what can be done with Seuss by someone who puts in a bit of effort. It is not hard to rhyme spanish!"
1,Terrible translation,"My daughter owns a wonderful collection of books in Spanish. This is possibly the worst translation I have ever seen. While books like Green Eggs and Ham are fun to read in Spanish, this one is a torture. They should find a new translator, one who can maybe even rhyme once in a while, and reissue this fantastic book."
2,What good is Dr. Seuss if it doesn't rhyme?,The Spanish portion of this book doesn't rhyme. I have seen other Dr. Seuss books in Spanish that do. This one is a direct translation of the English. I think it would have been a lot more effective to stray from the English enough to make the Spanish rhyme too!
2,To Seuss or not?,"Before you buy this book -- use the ""view it online option"".As the conflicting opinions point out:1) It has neither rhyme nor rythm in Spanish (e.g., it is not a Dr. Seuss book but a literal translation.2) If you want a faithful translation it seems to do thatMy opinion: There are plenty of parallel, side by side, etc. story books and the fun of Seuss is lost.But if you LOOK at the view it online, then you can decide if it meets your needs."
1,"Horrible, useless","Not only does this lose all the wit and charm of the original, it's not even very good as a Spanish primer. I can't imagine a real Spanish speaker using this kind of convoluted syntax. If you're looking for a fun Spanish children's book to read, then ""Huevos Verdes con Jamon"" (Green Eggs and Ham) is a much better choice, as well as many of the other Aida Marcuse translations. If what you want is a good vocabulary-builder transliteration, try the Spanish versions of P.D. Eastman's Books (""Corre, Perro Corre!"" or ""Eres tu Mi Mama?""). Anything but this."
2,Libera me from this film,"Heavy-heavy-handed South Korean action/drama of the risky lives of firefighters struggling to keep up with a serial arsonist bent on vengeance. The body count is pretty large by film's end. The flaws count, too -- with too many implausible heroics in flame-drenched buildings -- too many intense expressions -- overwrought poses -- and... pregnant... pauses.... The story's incoherence suggests that it took a backseat to the special effects. Not surprisingly, I suppose, the movie's supposed to be inspiring, too -- idolizing -- while not idealizing -- fireighters in general. But the movie should have made them smarter than shown here if they wanted to impress me. Still... if you like intense action with lots of fiery explosions and aimless running, I think I've found your film."
2,Not terrible for the eighties,"It's hard to get past the terrible haircuts and clothes, but once you do, this movie is not bad. It's funny, and disturbing at the same time. I like the scene when the rapist realizes he's been castrated, it's classic."
2,Not impressed,"My 3 year old was excited, at first, to get the airport tower to go along with his Jay Jay set. He was very disappointed though, and I think he only played with it 2 or 3 times. Brenda only says 2 or 3 phrases and you have to crank a really small handle in order to hear it."
3,Average Chris Young,"This serviceable score is available (but rare) in its unadulterated form (even more of Young's music without the rock and roll) but consider passing over both versions of the album. This is only average Chris Young work; the composer has said himself that he's a bit tired of being referred to as the Bela Lugosi of horror film music, and this weary yet-another-horror-film approach shows. Young's best work is Copycat, Nightmare on Elm Street II, Hellraiser II, Norma jean and Marilyn, Rounders, and the hard to find Hush. This CD sounds like the former three, but is lacking in spirit and energy. Man Who Knew Too Little and Murder in the First are popular favorites also, but die-hard Young fans will find this lackluster effort doesn't even compare to the composer's self-acknowledged lesser efforts such as Dark Half or Fly II. The score album is best left for collectors only. If you buy this, do it for the rock tracks."
1,cover is misleading,Had Urban Legends the soundtrack already with all the music from the bands and such. Was looking for the full score saw this green cool cover on this listing and thought this was it. But when I got it it was the same Cd I already had with the Urband Legends cover on it. Guess I should have read the listing better (my bad) but you could put the real cover on this so others don't get confused like myself Shame Shame on Amazon!Moviemakerrr
2,Save your money,"I bought this dress form and wish that I had saved up for a better product. I found that I ended up making so many padding alterations to the form that I just wished I had bought one made for me. I am basically built straight up and down, no hips. There is just no way to adjust for that without padding and duct taping. Your millage may vary."
4,Very helpful to me,"This commentary fills a large gap between the usual superficial Bible commentaries and very advanced works like the International Critical Commentary. (The volume on Esther in that series is anyway hopelessly out of date.) It provides a lot of solid information in a large solid volume but without overwhelming technicalities. Its attitude is that Esther is a comic novel, presumably with no historical basis for its plot although the background details are confirmed by modern archaeology. Don't expect light reading, but after you have read this you will have learnt a lot."
4,A GREAT CLASSICAL AND MODERNIST,"This is a wonderful album. It contains the most beautiful melodies Kostelanetz had performed. I enjoy in a very contemporary style the Classical melody RAVEL BOLERO. There is also included and what a great success in Kostelanetz carreer THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM, the main hit from the Broadway production and later Hollywood movie THE MAN OF LA MANCHA. These are the main hits that made Kostelanetz reach not only the top of fame, but also make him stay alive in many hearts, even if he had passed away. If you enjoy romantic and instrumental music, don't forget to add this album to your collection."
1,Garbage,"Purchased one of these for my .22 LR plinker. The red dot looks fine, and has 11 adjustable settings. Could be viewed on a sunny day on the highest setting.Initial install and sight-in were easy. Shot a few dozen rounds (~50) and put the gun away for the weekend. Two weeks later, pull out the plinker to fire a few rounds. The red dot is stuck high and to the left, both sight adjustments no longer function. Scope was not jarred or damaged in any manner. Rifle was not transported and firing was done a private residence.It would Cost ~$10 to ship back to BSA who requires a $10 fee to return the scope. Lesson learned and would never purchase a BSA product again."
2,Not worth the money,Neoprene bag that doesn't fit well over the winch with the wires coming out the sides. Wouldn't waste my money again!
1,WARN no better than a cheap imitation,"I live in the southern united states and purchased the WARN wench cover, because WARN is suppose to be ""the best."" I applied the ""aerospace"" protectant as directed, but within 60 days of installing on my wench....the black color had completely faded. I have spoken to other who purchased the same product and they took additional sun precautions and ended up with the same results. The cover fits great and protects from the rain ...but if you live in a sunny location and don't want a two tone wench cover, I would not purchase again."
2,Warn Neoprene cover.,Just a simple Neoprene bag. Worth maybe 10 at best. I regret the purchase and would have sent it back had it been bought in the UK.
2,Disappointing!,"I decided to read this book after I finished A Blessed Event, which I found quite good. This story is about Gina, recently widowed, and her husband's ex-wife who comes waltzing back into her life with a daughter in tow. I found that this book was better written than Page's first, but unfortunately I got really bored about halfway through the story. I don't want to spoil the plot for any reader, but let me just say that Gina and Reese are not consistent characters, are each as insecure as the other, and each time you think you got a pretty good idea of who they are, Page throws something in the story that confuses you. I didn't find the characters that well developed and after a while, I just wanted her to get on with things rather than move so slowly through the plot, which I found unrealistic at some points. Overall, I would not recommend this book."
4,Worth it in the end.,"This book was rather depressing at first, and I may have put it down if I hadn't needed to read it for book club. The last 100 or so pages make it all worth while. Don't bother making predictions- you'll be quite surprised at what happens."
2,Some general information but lacking in specifics.,"This text provides some good, basic information on gifted education and talks briefly about the needs in each curriculum area. It does not, however, provide very many specific ideas about content modification or differentiation. Other than a few passing references to technology, it is not substantially different than the 3rd edition."
4,Still thinking about it...,"Perhaps it isn't a definitive novel, but it realy makes you think. I was talking about it for days. I appreciated the insight to the male's psyche, and I loved the ending- completely appropriate for this felon you can't help but root for.I think it would make a fabulous movie...... tons of suspense."
5,"Approach this with an open mind, try it, and you just might be surprised! I was!","Excellent reference book, but be sure to first read ""Let There Be Light"" and ""Color Me Healthy"", which have more information about what color light should be used for specific ailments.Summary from Dinshah site:117 chapters thoroughly cover the development and theory of Spectro-Chrome. Written in 1933, the first two editions spanned 1200 pages in three volumes. Their wide margins and numerous pages pertaining to courses taught by Dinshah have been deleted; but the text has not been edited. While some scientific views conflict with some of Dinshah's, it remains for history and the reader to judge. Let There Be Light (item A above) is recommended for those new to Spectro-Chrome; though based on Dinshah's teachings, it has much greater emphasis on the practical application of Spectro-Chrome. 4th edition, 240 pages; 169 charts, tables, illustrations; hardbound.[...]"
1,waste of money,"impossibly hard for any age. Moves so quickly, no one can keep up. music is just electronic beeps. The plastic of the mat has a very bad odor. Save your money and skip this product."
2,not worth the money,the product looks like its something made in the present time but the games look like games from the late 1990's to early 2000. not worth the money.
4,Iggy Pop - 'The Complete A&M Recordings' (Hip-O) 3-CD,"A fine release and all, yet pretty much for the Iggy Pop completists and die-hards. You get, disc one: 1986's 'Blah Blah Blah' reissue, disc two: 1988's 'Instinct' and on disc three: his 'Live At The Boston Channel, 1988'. However, first two CD's feature four bonus tracks each of remixes, extended versions, etc. of otherwise unavailable cuts. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good find."
4,Sai case,"The product purchased was very nice. The quality and workmanship was of a high quality. It's overall look is clean, stylish and practical.I would recommend it to any martial artist who uses the sai during their training."
5,Love it!,"My son loved this toy so much we eventually bought both colored sets! The stuffed puppies certainly arent the best stuffed animal you can buy but for my son loved them more than the elaborate ones.......The carrier is very durable, so is the bone and other peices,The 2 bandaids though are just stickers and of course the certificate thing is just a postcard, The food is a plastic can with a paper label, it would have been very nice if it would have actually opened to reveal fake food. all together though my son loved them!I give it 5 stars! :)"
4,Luv My Pet Vet Center,"I received my package and it was a pink carrier with a kitten instead of a puppy and red case. I contacted the company via e-mail (no phone number available) regarding the problem and my concern in spending a lot of extra money to have it expedited in time for christmas only to receive the wrong item. They were wonderful about it. They responded immediately and told me to keep the wrong item and they would ship the right one out immediately. It turns out they were out of stock so they refunded my entire purchase. Even though I was disappointed in not receiving my item, I appreciated how they took care of the situation. My children have enjoyed the kitten, cage and accessories."
5,"Exploring the ""drama within""","In ""The Drama Within: Psychodrama and Experiential Therapy,"" prolific author Tian Dayton offers a look at the often-misunderstood method of psychodrama, which is the root of role-playing techniques.Her book is readable and informative for clinicians, students of psychodrama and people interested in alternative therapeutic treatments, with a special focus on psychodramatic treatment of adult children of alcoholic and dysfunctional homes. Her ""how it can help"" segments offer specific commentary on psychodramatic techniques and approaches."
4,very easy to follow and instructive...,"This book will introduce you to the path integralformulation of QFT, slightly more mathematical thanZee's QFT in a Nutshell.This one is a good complement to Ryder's book however onthe negative side the treatment is quite superficialand shallow.Overall, enjoyable reading... and would be a must buyhad it not been for its ridiculous price tag..."
4,WOW,"Like so many good movies, I never heard of it when it was in theaters and instead read a review somewhere or another. Then, when I was looking for something in the video store to watch I saw it and remembered having read about it. I'll tell you, it was probably a chance to see Maria Bello that also had me interested in it but I'm glad that I chose to watch it. This movie ranks up there with some of my favorites. The story is a good one but even better is the cenamtic effects that they slowly attempt to alter the viewers perception with. I'm not a cinema buff like my sister but I know a good movie when I see it and this one is definately one of my new favorites.Thank you for entertaining me."
4,LOVE STORY NOIR THAT ROLLS BOTH SWEET AND TOUGH,"Set in the unfashionable old section of Las Vegas, far away from glitzy/artsy strip that people identify with the city of sin, ""The Cooler"" draws us behind all the neon, the little people below the headliners and high rollers.Overlook the somewhat over-the-top script and savour the great breakout role for Maria Bello, yet another terrific-so-what-else-is-new turn by Will Macy, and the best work Alec Baldwin's done on the big screen since Glengarry Glen Ross. Plus, those notorious nudey scenes between Macy and Bello..In its delivery, it feels like it was poured from the bottle, not one of those bar regulator machines -- it's got the kick, style and flavor of a straight-up story, before movies were watered down with the opinions of marketers, lawyers and committee heads.A cool yet hot Vegas parable, with a charming hint of romance. Recommended rental."
1,one of the most overrated films of 2003...,"This was a pretty funny movie, but i'm sure anyone who knows the premise - it isn't supposed to be. I found myself laughing during the dramatic scenes, and cringing during the intended funny ones...The Cooler uses every Vegas cliche in the book, and then some. Their dramatic ""touches"" were like a hammer over the head. I can't tell you how many times I was saying out loud, ""Okay, I get it!""I could go on all day, but frankly that would be a waste of time. The mosy annoying thing about the film? Repeated scenes of Macy's pathetic Bernie character asking a worn-out waitress for a cup of coffee, and the cream being either full or empty, to symbolize his luck. Are you kidding me? Unfortunately not...- cRAIG"
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother watching this dark, depressing movie unless you are too happy and need something to bring you down quickly. The story is far-fetched, there are few likeable characters, and no, I didn't really need to see the great William H. Macy in bedroom scenes -- yes, that's scenes - not a scene. Alec Baldwin got a best supporting actor nomination for a very forgettable role in my opinion. I expected more."
4,Very cool and entertaining,"The Cooler exists just beyond the reach of what we know as reality. The film presents a world where luck is tangible; some people are lucky and others are not. While any statistician will tell you stories of quantifying luck are fallacious, many in Vegas find merit in them and thus employ people with bad luck to ""cool"" down a room. I can only assume Steve Buscemi was busy, so the only other actor worthy of playing someone whose degree of loser-dom was so great that he rubbed off on others had to be William H. Macy.Macy is great and Baldwin gives a career performance as his Casino boss. The plot of the story involves ""the cooler"" falling in love, becoming happy and losing his anti-Midas tough. The film also tackles issues of ""Old Vegas"" versus ""New Vegas"" and really educates as to the marketing theories that drive America's sin city. An overall enjoyable experience, I recommend it to any who is interested in Vegas (although the sex and violence may turn some off)."
2,Dark and Dingy,"I got taken in by some good reviews and wasted 100 minutes of my life watching this ugly little movie. It feels like a low-budget, R-rated episode of CSI; everything is dark and dingy, including the characters. Nobody, including the main character, Bernie, is very likable, and most of them are downright creepy. There's a lot of sadistic violence, and the ""saved by the bell"" ending is just dumb. I'm giving this two stars, rather than one, because Macy, Baldwin and Bello all turn in good performances, but overall ""The Cooler"" comes across as something Quentin Tarantino would do if he lost about 40 IQ points."
2,Ruined by the ending,"The ridiculously contrived 'happy' ending is totally out of character with the noir spirit of the rest of the movie, and the viewer is left to wonder what was the point of the story. Worse, a wonderfully ironic ending was right before the writers' eyes and they missed it. When Alec Baldwin's character comes over and begins watching Macy at the craps table, Macy should continue losing, then walk over to Baldwin and say, ""You don't need me anymore. You have a new cooler. More of a loser than I ever was."" And walk off. Baldwin's life is now worse than Macy's and he has taken over the role as the contagious loser."
4,GOOD MOVIE,"This movie had a lot of qualities that make a good movie. It's like a Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino movie-lite. I rented it, as I would recommend before buying it."
3,Why do I even ask?,"When we rented this movie, one person asked me if it was good. I'd never heard of it before, so I asked who was in it.'William H. Macy,' replies my friend.'Then it must be good,' I say.And honestly, it wasn't bad. But I expected more from a William H. Macy film, Macy being one of those actors that I hold in high esteem.After seeing the movie, I can most definitely say that it is not a chick flick. There are some very brutal beating scenes, some serious and funny moments, and sex that seems as gratuitous as it is odd. The intertwining love story is touching, and the 'bad guy' is rather tangible as he is real.The film wasn't for me, so I gave it three stars, but I must say that it would probably appease most men, or at least moreso than women."
4,Equal Parts Scorsese & Capra,"... THE COOLER was one pleasant surprise, a script that cleverly juxtaposes the grim, harsh, gritty reality of the fading gambling glory days of darker Las Vegas with the whimsical 'what if' element of a character (Bernie Lutz, played winningly by William H. Macy) hired by the slimy casino manager (Alec Baldwin, playing Alec Baldwin) to pass along his seemingly endless streak of bad luck to hot table players. Throw in the only stereotypical element of the script -- a down-on-her-luck cocktail waitress who originally came to Vegas to make it big as a showgirl now trying to go legit b/c she may've found her one shot @ true love -- and you've got a capitivating character study that's as much about the people who inhabit these roles as it is the times they live in. Wonderful performances, outstanding camera work, and a complementing music score make THE COOLER one hot flick."
2,"and what was the name of that little guy with the cloud over his head in ""lil abner""?","one of the themes here is akin to that of ""casino"", i.e. the end of the old las vegas. much like movies that bemoan the passing of manhattans deuce, i guess you had to be there to get it. otherwise this is a turgid soap opera/fantasy about william macy, professional loser who is used by casino owner alec baldwin to serve as a hex on gamblers who are winning too big. until the day he falls in love and loses his sprcial skill. the movie should have been better than it is, but a screenplay that reads like it came out of a college ""how to write a screenplay"" course just brings it down to a tad below mediocre."
1,Way behind it's time,"I like William Macy and Alec Baldwin, and the movie begins with some mystery. But any early promise is soon whacked into left field by the B-movie scenario, in which the obvious holds firm sway.. We are supposed to believe that an ageing Las Vegas hack (The Cooler) with a very bad and greasy toupe falls into a meaningful relationship with a sexy (heart of gold, natch)hooker at his casino.Of course, true love comes with his first real sexual experience in years; and hack and hooker become someone we pin our hopes on, depite the bad dialogue, and the sub-plot of a lost son belonging to the hack, who gives us a chance to dive more deeply into the swampy mire that is this movie. Worst of all, it has a happy ending! Take my word--this mess is predictable and soupy. Give it a pass."
3,it's pretty good,"One of those kind of movies that is centered in Las Vegas&will keep you interested but it's not a film you want to watch to many times.William Macy does a good job,but He always plays these type of roles.Alec Baldwin does decent as well. some typical cliches which weigh the film in spots.but still a interesting film."
4,Jackpot,"Get lucky, see this movie. Good acting and writing. Cringe and laugh, and wonder why this movie didn't get a bigger play before dvd."
4,"Vegas, Lady Luck, and some fine acting...","Beautifully photographed in an unvarnished Vegas, William H. Macy plays ""the cooler"" in an old-school casino. Employed by the Casino manager (Alec Baldwin), the cooler brings bad luck to a hot table or a gambler on a roll. The bad karma emanating from Macy is visceral. Everything in his life is dead or dying. His contract in Vegas is days from coming to a close and he intends to get out - fast.Then, a seemingly chance encounter with a cocktail waitress (Maria Bello) changes everything. They fall for each other - hard. And the cooler's dance with lady luck begins anew.Plagued by a bunch of serious plot holes, the script is probably the weakest link in the film. Macy, Baldwin and Bello are each outstanding in their respective roles, salvaging - with sheer determination and skill - what could have been a disaster. Because they are so believable... we believe: in the possibilities that love brings... and lady luck."
4,The Cooler,"Bernie Lootz is a loser. He is so much a loser that he makes the people around him have bad luck. And that comes in handy in his job as a ""cooler"" at the Shangri-La Casino in Las Vegas. Whenever someone is getting a little too lucky in the casino, in comes Bernie, and the hot streak is over. But then a funny thing happens...Bernie finds love in a cocktail waitress at the Shangri-La, and all of a sudden, Bernie's cooling powers are failing him. This is not good news for the owner, Shelly Kaplow who is feeling pressure from a mob boss to update his business methods. William H. Macy has sort of perfected the loser guy roles, so it is no surprise that he gives a good performance as Bernie, and when things start to go right for him, you feel happy for the poor guy. Alec Baldwin does a great job as the casino owner clinging to an antiquated way of doing things. All in all, a surprisingly enjoyable little movie."
4,Just a simple good movie,"You have read the storyline here written by others. I knew nothing of this movie when I started watching it. It was the stars that even made me watch the unfolding story. What a loser, yes the heart of gold hooker (but it happens) and I like Alex Baldwin as an actor. He was a bit ""hefty"" in this roll but maybe the script called for over weight.This isn't the kind of movie I can watch over and over because it is so strong. It is well work watching,tho but not for light even entertainment.(DVD)"
4,"Vegas, Baby","This film plays like an independent film--and it is, for all I know. THE COOLER is about that sordid strata of Vegas below the glam-fest of the rich and the amusement park rides of the ""family-friendly"" Sin City.But it has an excellent cast playing believable characters (Macy, Bello and Baldwin are each fantastic), so it's actually a cut above most independent films.And it's better written than most indie films: characters are introduced at first seem like the usually-meaningless ""character studies"" of indie films--but in THE COOLER, their presence ends up meaning something to the story.It might be about the losers of Vegas, but THE COOLER is a winner."
3,Just OK,"I really like William H. Macy (especially in ""Shameless"" and so was recommended this film. It had some good points, but all in all was pretty mediocre and the retelling of numerous Vegas hard-luck movies. Somewhat depressing."
4,vegas style movie,"after seeing this movie i was quite surprised at how much i liked it.i've liked maria bello since i saw the movie duets.this was not a typical movie for her.liked alex baldwin too.so if you like movies such as casino,go for it,love,sex,action and a few unexpected things."
2,not so hot,"Ever wondered what might have happened if Martin Scorsese had teamed up with Franka Capra? Wonder no more--the result would have been this simplistic fantasy (a pitiful shlub possesses the magical power to make Vegas casino players lose the minute he shows up at the table) jazzed up with stomach-churning violence and unnecessary nudity (do we really need to see William Macy naked?)Besides an unbelievable set-up (as the old-school casino manager/owner/whatever--it's never made clear exactly why he's calling all the shots--Alec Baldwin portrays a character that's been extinct in Vegas for 30 years), Macy is saddled with yet another variation on his tiresome sad-sack role. Take a pass."
2,Just Not That Good!!!,"movie overpowered by sex scenes, that's right, un-necessarily so! if the acting can support itself, then it's just not needed. period. alec baldwins part is well done, and so is macy's, only to a point though, and quickly fizzles...the blond's part can be played by any blonde (anywhere) no real talent required or delivered here...really, don't bother with this one, it's just not that good!"
4,good coffee,Not the best krups coffee maker I've owned but still worlds above other brands and adequate for the price
2,Wait Broke the Wagon Down,"Product took much longer to arrive than promised. Amazon was great, and gave us a $10 credit. If you order this coffee maker immediately remove the sand filter, and throw it away. The filter will break, and flood the machine with sand rendering it useless."
2,Great pot with quality problems,"We went through 3 of these pots purchased from Amazon before they just informed us they cannot provide yet another replacement due to quality issues. If that's the case, I am not sure why it is still for sale on the web site. The pot worked great for us, except for the useless clock that is only visible while you're brewing coffee. Here are the problems we had with our three units:1) All 3 had dents or ripples in the very flimsy stainless steel skin on the coffee/filter door. We finally figured they must be denting the metal during the packaging process because of how firmly you have to grip the pot to jam the foam packaging material in above the carafe.2) The second pot had a malfunctioning water level indicator3) The third pot has a malfunctioning coffee/filter door lever and also the heating plate surface is flaking off.If Krups can get their quality under control, I'd happily try this pot again."
2,Not worth the $$$,"I bought a similar model with the thermal caraf. I love the function of the thermal caraf, it keeps the coffee fresh and hot for hours, however, the swinging door above the coffee pot which holds the coffee filter and coffee is an extremely poor design. The door falls off very easily. For a machine costing $100+ it should never fall off. I am very disappointed. Krups let me down with this model machine."
1,Quality and Pot Problems,"I purchased this coffeemaker for my wife for Christmas. She is an avid coffee drinker who always has a pot brewed. This was definitely the wrong choice! The overall quality of the coffemaker is poor at best but the most aggrevating problem is that it is impossible to pour a cup from the glass decanter without half of it dribbling down the side of the pot onto the counter. Pour it fast, pour it slow, the same results. Only had it a month and already shopping for a new coffemaker and it definitely will not be Krups!"
2,Better than the the Black & Decker we had,"I bought this coffeemaker on clearance at a local store and am somewhat happy with it considering the price that I paid (dirt cheap). It pours a cup of coffee nicely and doesn't spill all over the place like the last (God awful) coffeemaker we had. I thought that this one was attractive too, but I've had it for less than 6 months and the silver color has flaked off of the buttons and water reservior cover broke off. It works fine, but is cheaply made."
5,Have had absolutely no problems,"I have had this coffee maker, so far, for two weeks, and have had none of the problems described in any of the reviews so far. Took the coffee maker out of the box and everything worked fine. It makes good coffee."
2,Now made in China.,"This is my 3rd Krups coffee maker, and sorry to say it will be my last. It is now made in China, and the fit and finish is not up to the last two by a long shot. Krups, you have lost a customer!"
5,The best,"I bought this coffeemaker to replace the Krups that served me well for 10 years. The old one still works but doesn't keep the coffee as hot as it once did. This coffeepot is fast, easy to program, and reliable. In ten years I'll buy another Krups."
4,coffeemaker,"It makes a good cup of coffee and has a buzzer when it's ready.Easy to use. Lots of features like a program to auto start,which we don't use."
3,"Some good, some bad","This coffeemaker makes a great pot of coffee & the advance timer function is a real advantage.Waking up to coffee already made is mighty convenient. The functions are relatively easy to program, though the image of machine w/names of parts should have been put on the facing page of the usage instructions.The water gauge has constant air bubbles (very annoying) so amount of water has to be reckoned by the pot. The ""finished brewing"" alert is so faint that if one isn't directly next to the pot,it can't be heard. Minor annoyances,I grant,but need to be addressed."
1,Doesn't work very well,"The coffee maker appears to be over-engineered and does not work well. It brews v-e-r-y---s-l-o-w-l-y, requires nearly constant cleaning for mineral deposits and requires a lot of coffee grounds in order to make a decent, Puget Sound strength cup of coffee. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,"Looks good, but isn't easy to operate","This coffee maker looks good on the kitchen counter. And it makes good coffee. Having said that, mine leaks water slowly whenever the reservoir is filled. So far, Krups has not responded to my email sent to them from their website asking how I get this issue fixed.Slightly irritating is the 15-second process required to turn on the auto-brew program - even required when you are NOT changing the brewing time.I have had 2 or 3 Krups coffee makers. They seem to last about 2-3 years and then self-destruct and stop working. I will probably be looking for a new brand of coffee maker next time around."
1,Stoped working after 4 months,After 4 months it gave an error message showing the there was no water in it when there was. Could not reset. Junk
2,Okay but many little issues,"I like to program my coffee maker. That is my number one criteria because I want it waiting for me when I wake up.My gripes with this one are small but many:1. The programming is not self-explanatory and you have to use the manual. Petty, but why can't I just have clock and timer options?2. The carafe leaks when pouring. Just drips on the counter.3. The basket doesn't stay closed. This is a brand new unit and twice the basket has popped open during brewing.4. The rubber feet pop out. I drag my unit forward to fill it since it sits on the counter with cabinets above it. And half the time, the litter rubber feet pop out.The coffee is good. And one thing this unit does is brew it hot and keep it hot. But I am about to toss it after three weeks and buy something else."
1,Nothing but trouble,"I have had this coffee maker for about a year and keep having problems with it. I'm getting ready to toss it! First issue: the handle on the carafe fell off when I'd had this for 3 months. Just popped right off (only held together with some cheapie adhesive stickers). Luckily, it was replaced at no charge. Now the water reservoir viewer on the front keeps popping off the connector at the bottom. Whenever I fill the coffee maker with water, water will pour out of the bottom of the reservoir viewer. What a mess! I've been using duct tape to hold it together, but this is ridiculous and not the best fix. I've had Krups coffeemakers in the past, but the quality has really dropped. I'll be looking for another brand next time."
3,Bit disappointed in Drups,"I have had numerous Krups coffeemakers over the years and have always been pleased. So, when my last one died, I purchased the Krups FME4,since it had all the options important to me. After the first couple days of use, I was a bit disappointed with my purchase. The first problem was the lid can not be removed from the carafe which causes a problem getting it easily into a dishwasher and it is very flimsy. The stainless steel front which looks great, shows every fingerprint and the door can not be closed without touching the finish. Last issue although the least of the problems is that it's the loudest brewing coffee maker I have ever owned. I have never heard anything quite like it. You could almost use it for an alarm clock, but you know when you coffee is done because it beeps too."
1,Very unhappy,"Bought this coffee maker in black less than a year ago. Did some research - seemed like the right coffee maker at the right price. I really wanted one like my old Mr Coffee with the removable water reservoir, but settled for this one when I couldn't find that. Within a few months, the hot plate at the bottom of the coffee pot started peeling. Not just a little bit - there is very little paint left and it is starting to rust. I will be replacing this soon - and definitely not with another Krups!"
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this coffee maker about 8 months ago. Yesterday it stopped working. The indicator on the LCD panel is for the water sensor, saying that it is out of water (it is not). Despite all the plugging, unplugging, dumping water out, etc., it's dead. In addition to not lasting long, the controls are difficult to figure out and the beeping noise that it makes is really obnoxious (although you can turn off the beep, the noise indicator resets itself to ""on"" everytime you unplug the machine, which I do every day). This coffee machine also does not come with a reusable filter and requires a ""duo"" water filter, which is an additional ongoing expense. I did not notice any improvement in coffee taste when I used the duo filter...which oddly enough is made and sold only by Krups."
2,Worked for less than 2 years,"After about 18 months, the unit quit working. Symptom? The dreaded 'no water' warning even though water was in the tank and showing on the side gauge.Will not be buying another Krups."
2,Coffee Tastes Like Plastic - Poor quality,"I purchased this Krups FME4-14 12 cup Coffeemaker in May of 2008, and from the very beginning the first pot of coffee tasted like ""plastic"". I cleaned the pot several times with plain distilled water, but to date each pot of coffee still tastes like plastic. If that were not bad enough, the painted coating on the control buttons which is silver is peeling off. I called Krups and they said I would have to have it serviced at my expense. I previous coffeemaker which was a Braun, lasted three years without any problems what so ever....I will never purchase another Krups coffeemaker again, due to the poor workmanship and the lack of customer service. I'm still waiting for a follow-up call from Krups and it's been 10 days."
3,Not as good as I hoped,I was excited about purchasing this coffee maker but I agree with some of the other reviewers. The bubbles on the left inaccurately tell how much water is in the base. Now the off/on button is stuck and it doesn't turn on! That's a real bummer when you're ready for your coffee.
2,Poor Usability,"Looks nice, but...Very frustrating to set the time and alarm, and other options. Previous model by krups was much better, as it had separate buttons for setting various functions. Hard to pour without dripping. Seems like the usability of this model has dropped. Also, once it turns off, you can't turn the base heater back on to reheat the coffee (frowned upon, I know, but something that is done in the real world). Coffee tastes average to me."
1,burned my hands and made a mess!!,"I am not a patient person when waiting for my morning cup.... so when my less than 12 hour old, 1st time used KRUPS fme4 filter door swung open when removing my 1st cup (after 5 cups had brewed). The full to the top filter swung around and splashed all over me. from what i can tell, while brewing, the filter cup gains about 1/2 pound and the cheap door cannot support the weight. therefore.. while removing the pot to use the pause feature, the filter pushes down on the pot lid and opens while removing the pot.. Also, the decanter design is poor. you must pour slowly so it doesnt run down the side of the pot and make a mess. Time to buy a BUNN!!!!I would not recommend this particular model AT ALL!!!!!!!!"
2,Nice features...but,"I bought this coffeemaker earlier this year. It had all the bells & whistles I wanted. However, it makes one of the worst tasting cups of coffee I have ever put in my mouth! I would not recommend it to anyone who really enjoys a smooth tasting cup of coffee as this pot will ruin it for you!"
1,Poor product,"When you get over the superb look of the machine, pray that nothing goes wrong - as it will inevitably. Krups machines are all hand-built in China (!) and there is no justification for such a high ticket price. Not only that, when the machine gives up you'll be lumbered with the expense of sending it back to Krups' appointed agent.Take my advice - buy something cheaper and don't be fooled by the looks. As my old Grandmother used to say; it's all fur coat and no underwear!"
3,Water runs out the back,"I used this coffee maker one week when the water, when filled, would run out the back onto the counter. I contacted Krups, they sent an UPS shipping label, I mailed it to them for their servicing (they were very nice) and it has been about a month, and still havent gotten it back.My former Krups I really liked-too bad it died, this one worked well too. We'll see how it works when I get it back. Things just aren't made very well these days, even new things."
2,Krups FME-4-14 12 cup coffeemaker,"What a disappointment! My wife and I got our new coffeemaker home and hurried to assemble it. After filling the water reservoir, the water level tube started leaking on the side of the unit. Today we will be taking the coffee maker back."
1,Lots of Problems,"I've had other Krups coffee pots so thought this would be ok - it is terrible. Very light and flimsy, the water indicator does not work properly (though my old Krups had the same problem after awhile) the carafe drips no matter how you pour it. Hate the auto program on this machine. Got it for Xmas and 2 months later looking for a new one."
1,Bitter taste and bad odor,"No matter what kind of coffee we use or what type of grind, we usually get bitter tasting coffee with this Krups unit. It always gives off an ""overheated"" smell. After two months of twice-daily use we are giving up and looking for a new coffee maker."
3,Okay Replacement,"I've read the other reviews, and find no quality problems with the construction of the unit. The pause-n-serve feature is miles ahead of the complicated-and-never-worked-right Braun. The ONLY drawbacks are the drips when pouring a cup (what a pain) and the water level indicator filling up with air bubbles. The coffee flavor is fine, and the programming (although more complicated than necessary) is actually convenient because you don't have to re-set it every day. Overall, a fine replacement for the Braun 12-cup flavor select."
2,not worth it,"I wanted a basic coffeemaker that make decent coffee. I do not expect this coffeemaker to brew the best considering the price point. But, directions were unclear, the water filtration stick, what a gimmick...Also, I have used this coffee maker, my husband used it and we are yet to pour a cup of coffee without it spilling out over my counter! Coffee spills out of the carafe as you pour...I will probably invest in a better machine next time."
3,Cheap Looking,I sent this book back after receiving it. The cover was damaged and was a cheap paper material that would not have lasted long. I ended up finding the perfect baby book at Target!
4,"Really cute, but kinda lengthy...","I really like how this baby book looks, it's very pretty for a little girl. It is a lot of work to get it all filled out though. There is a lot of info to write in & seems to repeat questions & things a lot. I wish it were little more simple."
3,Save your money and get the same thing for less,"This is a great memory book. I love the pages and all of the information you can track. You should be aware, however, that the exact same book is available at Wal-Mart for $12 in the baby section."
4,SKWOOSH X-Treme Paddling cushion,"I have pain in my leg and hip without this wonderful pad! My white water kayak has that hard plastic seat where no matter how much you squirm around, you can't get comfortable. This pad over a foam kneeling pad for gardeners makes all the difference. I can paddle for a couple of hours with minimal discomfort before needing to get out and move around. The small size and bright color are really nice, too.4 stars since I have to use it with another pad, otherwise great!"
5,This works for me.,Have gone 16 miles comfortably with this cushion. Have not taken it on an extended trip yet.It was not comfortable with the original seat alone.
3,Provides some cushion,"I purchased this for my SOT kayak for the kind of seat I have. After a couple hours on the water my left tailbone or sitz bone just starts killing me. This pad helped that issue out a little bit but I still have the issue so most likely it's more my own physical shortcoming. I only hurt on the left side, my right never bothers me. All in all it doesn't alleviate the pain as much as I had hoped but I still would rather use this as an addition to my seat than go without. Unfortunately I left it in the kayak seat the other day when coming home and it blew out. Couldn't find it anywhere so will probably get another one soon."
3,What cushion?,I am a little disappointed with this product. I thought it was going to have a little more padding to it. More like sitting on a book.
1,My thoughts on this pad,"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! I have problems with pain in my left buttock when kayaking for 30 min or longer. The pain starts in the sits bones (the bones that connect the leg and hip) and becomes more intense as I continue to kayak. Sometimes, the pain ""shoots"" down to left my knee, reminescent of ""sciatica"". I thought this pad would be a ""cheap"" and easy to pack remedy for my problem. The pad did nothing for my pain, in fact, my Thermarest pad does a better job. I ended up making my own pad from a yoga matt which works better than anything I've tried. Just cut the yoga matt in strips so that the resulting pads cover all but the sits bones. I made a pile of 4 strips (front, back, and sides) and fit them into a mesh bag (one with a zipper intended for laundering delicate items such as stockings). I sewed around the pads so they wouldn't move around. Works very nicely and is cheap! My advice, don't buy the SKWOOSH!"
4,Just what the home baker needs,"This is a good book for the home baker who wants to know the how's and why's of baking, but, it's a read only book. There are no charts or pictures. I think it would have been a nice feature if the recipes had pictures. It is a good book, if you want to study. I wanted a book that laid it all out for me; with a chart that told how each ingredient effects the process of baking. I didn't want to have to read!"
5,lets dance with NATARAJ !!!,Ralph's work is a shock a glimp of truth there is no other way then to dance with It.You can not fool yourself anymore on the moment you have danced with Nataraj.Have a look in this book its the grand entrance to...I followed Nataraj for some time now...But i coudnt expect this before that time.and...You dont wanna do a whole lifetime about figgering it out do you?so accept this great offer from a great being to get it clearlove& blessingsM
5,Brilliant,"Modern day botanist Dr. Campbell's account of thirty years in this remote Amazon rainforest is both a captivating read of adventure and more importantly a daunting paradigm of what has happened to this esoteric land.Every molecule of the natural, physical and anthropological world is magically transformed with zesty and passionate prose. The author's own escapades with jaguars, caimans and deadly snakes, to legends of tribes with tails and spirits with backward feet leaves the reader mesmerized.Blend historical blunders of rubber exploitation, cattle farms, slavery, the Trans-Amazon Highway, etc. with the resulting decimation of native populations by disease and dilution of heritage, this book is a soothsayer of how humankind has not been so kind.Everyone and everything loses from self-righteous and mindless practices such as occurred here. The outcome are ghosts with haunting apparitions from the past."
2,"some good, some bad","The ""good"" is that there are some very interesting stories in the book. The ""bad"" is that, in my opinion, it rambles in some places, especially in the last half of the book. Another ""bad"" is that the author uses a lot of uncommon words that only someone with an incredible vocabulary would understant. Example: page 127 (picked at random)uses the words: Flummoxed, estivation, tropeiro, mealy, prehensile, transect, naunce, anthocyanins, cotyledoms, transect, bromeliads. Trying to get through that for over 200 pages was a workout for me. The author also uses meters and hectars, not feet and acres, so distances and area are hard to understand. In addition he uses a lot of Portuguese words. There is a Portuguese glossary in the back if you don't mind flipping back and forth while you read, which I don't take the time to do. The author is an excellent writer, too bad it is so difficult to read."
3,the belts are not equally wide,"Somehow I don't feel comfortable when there are two belts or shoelaces not linked anywhere. Their width is not equal. So if I sew them on the shoes, that won't look nice. The shoes may not need a lace to tie tight. But to secure, the laces may still be needed. So I will return the shoes."
2,Ballet flats,"I thought these shoes would afford more comfort. The sole is so thin that I can only wear them inside the house. If I step on a pebble, I feel it. I find myself tying the laces all the time, even when double knotted. I will keep wearing them around the house but certainly not for running errands around town. I wear a size 8.5M and had to go a whole size larger in order to get a comfortable fit."
5,Review: Gurdjieff's Legacy,"The most intensely creative period of Gurdjieff's work is documented here, culminating many years later in his death, which, true to his life, was used as a final teaching opportunity. Walking us through the relevant locales in France and America, the focal points of this phase of the teaching, Patterson implicitly invites the viewer to enter into his footsteps, to see what he is seeing. The result is a feeling of unsentimental reverence and awe for Gurdjieff, his body of work, and the extraordinary people he gathered around him. One only need to compare this level-headed and even-handed voicing of the Work to the many shameless and dangerous repackagings--by those with a hunger for power, ego, and money--to get a sense of the discrimination needed when entering into a path of real self transformation."
5,Gurdjieff's Legacy,"William Patrick Patterson's third video, Gurdjieff's Legacy, continues the trilogy of films detailing Gurdjieff's work with students, this covering the period from 1924 to his death in 1949. Having read Patterson's Struggle of The Magicians, I was moved by the visual representation of the ideas in the book, and it led me to not only re-read the book, but watch the film several times again for what I missed the first time. I eagerly await Patterson's next offering."
5,Best of the trilogy...a piece of art!,"Gurdjieff's Legacy tells the story of the final part of G.I. Gurdjieff's life where after receiving many ""no's"" in passing on the ideas to his students, he finally receives a ""Yes"" from the writing of his three book legominism All & Everything. This has really opened a door for me for more explorations of the ideas of The Fourth Way. The visuals used such as the video and photo montages for me made this video a piece of art, one that you will want to see for yourself."
5,beautiful and awe inspiring footage,"This beautifully filmed video is like nothing I have ever seen: gorgeous footage of Mt. Adams blanketed in snow, wild and forbidding, from eyes of a solo skier. It is a portrait of a mountain, an adventure film, and an affirmation that one can still find wilderness and solitude in 2012. This is a perfect video to watch on a plane flight from Seattle, and to contemplate our beautiful mountains, up close and personal."
2,What happened to this series?,"As a fan of the TOCA Pro Race Driver series, I had to pick up this new installment. And, I'm terribly disappointed. The graphics have been improved over TOCA PRD 2---You can finally use anti-aliasing without any problems. The physics seem to be decent---they feel less arcarde-like than PRD 2. But, the driver AI is absolutely dire. It is impossible race a clean line...the AI will knock you off the road without a second thought. In fact, if the AI was better, I'd give this game a much higher rating.Also, this game has limited support for the Logitech G25 racing wheel. It does support the clutch, but there is no support for the 6-speed shifter. I haven't seen a patch that adds support, either. If Codemasters patched in G25 support and fixed the driver AI, this could be a fun little game. Instead, it's just sitting on the shelf collecting dust.If you like racing games, pass on this one. If you're a hardcore TOCA fan, you are not missing anything by not purchasing this game."
3,Let down after the long wait,"After being on a waiting list of almost one year to get this game, to be honest I and everyone else expected to be blown away. After Soul Reaver I, which was really something for a PS1 game, this PS2 version is nothing special. There are fun moments and some nice cut scenes, and cut scenes, oh and did I mention the cut scenes? Hey we all wanted a game but we got sold a movie with a few ""gaming"" sequences."
3,Nicely Done But Far Too Short & Repetitive.,I enjoyed this game more for it's graphics and dialog more than it's actual gameplay. And I must say it was far too short. Soul Reaver for PSX was longer and you were more involved in the story. There was excitement and antcipation for a sequel that just confuses me and seems very rushed. They should maybe redo this came and call it a second edition or something. As it stands it was a bit of a disappointment. Great voice acting though!
3,Really couldn't get into this one,"This game looked promising, and it was inexpensive so I took a chance. It's an okay game: the graphics are good but not amazing, the storyline is okay, etc. I just really didn't get hooked on it the way I did with Devil May Cry, the Final Fantasys, and others. I also didn't play the first one, though it is not necessary to pick up on the story. If you like the first one, then you'll probably like this, otherwise I would say spend your money elsewhere."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I'm keeping this very short, just like the game. Great graphics, landscaping, and sound compared to the original, but not enough to make up for the quantity of gameplay offered. I have a very tight schedule and was able to beat the game in 4 nights. This is it, after a year of anticipation and bumped release dates!!! I agree with the others. Rent it - Don't waste your money!"
5,Soul Reaver 2 NOW AVAILABLE,I have my copy in my hand. It's excellent. I think everyone will enjoy it.
2,"Graphics Good, Gameplay Just Ok, Ending TERRIBLE!","I couldnt tell you how excited i was to finally get my hands on this game, i started playing and was enjoying it, the graphics were great, everything was top notch and the story was progressing pretty good. You have to go into this game knowing that its short, for this reason DO NOT BUY IT RENT IT!! It took me 2 days, maybe a total of about 8 - 10 hours to finish this game. The final reason i say rent this and dont buy it is because the ending is absolutely the biggest let down I have yet experienced in a game i was really into. Remember soul reaver 1, the ending was good, it wrapped up mysteries and left a bigger mystery open but at least soul reaver 1's story was pretty much wrapped up. Soul Reaver 2, Everything is left wide open, NONE of the story is wrapped up and the ending, well, lets just say, theres some text at the end, and thats it. HUGE DISAPOINTMENT. Be warned. Cause of the ending i give it a two."
3,Disappointment,"Don't get me wrong, this game was a great deal of fun for the 4 hours it lasted.Crystal Dynamics promised a sequel to Soul Reaver and delivered an expansion. New abilities? They are non existant. In fact, abilities from the first game have been taken away. Explore Nosgoth? Well yes, very a small portion. You explore it in 3 different eras but it's still the same place.The bottom line is that fans of the series should rent this game. You can easily beat it over a weekend. Hopefully SR3 will finally give Soul Reaver fans a finished product."
3,"Too Much Flash, Not Enough Game","If you've played ""The Bouncer"" then you know what I'm talking about (but SR2 isn't even close to being THAT bad). The game has great graphics, an innovative story line and awesome voice talent. But the game itself is short from start to finish (I don't count movies as playing time), easier than the first (especially if you have played the first) and as far as I can tell, there aren't any secrets to find. It's an enjoyable game, but when it ended, I had the ""Is that all"" feeling. Overall, I'm disappointed that with all of the delays this is the final result. I recommened that you rent it because it won't take long enough to finish to be worth buying."
2,What a dissappointment!!!,"I love SR1, and I've been waiting for this ever since. What a dissapointment. The graphics are good, and the voice acting remains the best in the business, but the actual game play is repetitive and linear. You basically engage in the same fight over, and over, and over again, to go from cutscene to cutscene (not that the cutscenes aren't great). There are no true boss fights, nothing to discover, and the puzzles, while more varied than SR1, are still pretty basic. I would make this a weekend rental, b/c you won't need more than that to finish it. The DVD extras are fun, but unless you are a complete Legacy of Kain fanatic, this game will dissappoint you."
3,a soul reaver fan,i am a die hard soul reaver fan. when the first one came out on the playstation it was my favourate game and i enjoyed playing it over and over again.As for soul reaver 2 it started off very well but then it started to bore the hell out of me because all you do in the game is go back and forth back and forth over and over again with nothing new to discover other than to change your reaver into a different colour.another thing that really pissed me off is that it had no bosses at all through the whole game and there are no spells that you get like in the first soul reaver.I beat the game in a day and a half which makes it much much shorter than the first game so i returned it and got resident evil code varonica x which is 10 times better.If you are looking for a good game similar to sould reaver 2 then get DEVIL MAY CRY because that game is seriously the greatest game i have ever played in my entire life.
5,Awesome,"This is one those games that justifies the ($)you have to shell out for a PS2. The graphics are fluid and very detailed. No fog to hide details or anything. Also Raziel starts out with most of the powers from the first Soul Reaver which is cool. The voice work is good and the story is twisted but it flows pretty well. Beware, this game sucks you in and you'll spend several hours before you know it. The first night I played it, I ended up playing for about 5 hours. The puzzles are tricky, and it not just a series of block puzzles. To be honest there are only a few games that, in my opinion, are real stand-outs. This is the best of them. I haven't finished the game yet so I haven't seen everything. From what I've seen you can't go wrong getting this game. Finally a bunch good titles are coming out for PS2, but so far this the best you get on the PS2."
4,And the story unravels,"After some bits of information, curious and stunning, from Soul Reaver 1, in this game a lot of plots are revealed involving Raziel's destiny, and his relation of vengeance and hatred with Kain slowly transforms into a more purposeful journey. Nosgoth's past and future situations are shown as Raziel's jouneys through them and new enemies are available. The game is graphically prettier than S.R.1, but it's replay isn't as thrilling as S.R.1. In my opinion, gamers and lovers of the series should play this game for its value in the plot, and as always, the voice acting is superb, even better than S.R.1. Recommended if you're not satisfied with the game's plot displayed on many sites through the internet."
2,Dissappointed,"I have been waiting for this game for a long time. What a major dissapointment. Great story, terrible game. No bosses to fight. No real challenge to the game at all. If you want to play a good Soul Reaver, replay the first one. This was obviously just a vehicle to get to Soul Reaver 3. I spent the entire game waiting for a challenge that never came. In the end it's a great story, but if I wanted just a great story I would rent a movie. Just like this game, if you have to play it because of the first one... rent it don't buy it."
3,Really good,"I love the Blood Omen series. This game plays almost EXACTly like the first Soul Reaver, so the controls should be really firmilar. Everything looks great, and the sound and voice-over acting is top-notch.If there was a criticism to be placed anywhere, I thought the game was really on the shorter side. I honestly think it took me less then a week to wrap it up."
4,Boston Terrier Flag,"This is the second time I've bought this flag. The old one got somewhat weather-beaten, which is to be expected. There is a lot of goofy-looking animal ""art"" out there and I feel this depicts a Boston Terrier nicely."
2,Cheesy keyboards and a programmed drum machine...,"Cyndi's voice sounds terrific on this album but it's surrounded by really cheesy keyboards and a programmed drum machine. It sounds very `80's and very dated. Her voice deserves to be heard with real instruments that sound much warmer such as on the one song on here that stands the test of time...""True Colors"". The only other song that's worth owning here is her cover of ""What's Going On?"" Even Iko Iko is pretty weak. Cyndi does have a pretty impressive array of guest musicians helping out here...The Bangles, Nile Rodgers, Billy Joel, Ellie Greenwich, Rick Derringer, Aimee Mann and guitar god Adrian Belew plays the lead guitar on ""What's Going On?"" She even has the immortal Pee Wee Herman playing the Operator on the song ""911""! I would love to hear her remake many of these songs minus the electronics"
3,True Colors-Cyndi Lauper,This is a fun collection of music. Cyndi Lauper is a gem and she makes a good addition of my collection of era music.
3,Pretty good but out of date,"A solid tutorial style guide to ArcScene and ArcMap version 8. With ArcMap 9.2 out and ArcGlobe about to nudge out ArcScene, the book needs a new edition. It is a useful and informative book."
1,"Shame, shame...massive plagiarism","I purchased Kitchen Witchery from a local bookstore and returned it the next day. Normally a fan of Weiser books, I was shocked to find blatant plagiarism of so many other (mostly Llewellyn) books. This book is a mixture of the entire Complete Book of Incense, Oils & Brews by Scott Cunningham with a few other sources from authors Laurie Cabot and the Farrars. Daniel has so very thinly paraphrased Cunningham's own words (example: ""always stir clockwise"" becomes rewritten as ""stir clockwise always"") that I am amazed this was published by such a reputable firm as Weiser. The worst part of this collection of ""secrets"" is that Daniel has listed identitcal recipes from other authors but CHANGED THE INGREDIENT AMOUNTS as well as left out important information about safe handling of the ingredients. This book reads like a garbled online Book of Shadows and is an insult to the hard work done by the authors listed in Daniel's bibliography."
1,Blatant Thievery,"I own this book, I would have returned it but the cover got damaged. As previous reviewers have stated this book is pretty much nothing but plagiarism. 400 recipes, several of which Iam looking at right now in Cunningham's Incense, Oils & Brews, the only difference between many of the recipes is the proportions and the difference is 1 drop for each component oil. While it's nice to have one book to refer to, spend the extra money and buy the originals (Cunningham, Cabot, Farrar) at least that way the proper people, or their estates, get the money and maybe someone elses life work won't get ripped off."
1,Mostly repeats from Cunningham's books and others,out there. How do these publishers get away with out and out plagiarizing other authors? Very few original recipes. I would be angry if I were the original author.
4,Problems with the contents,"My three-star review is a net review of 4 stars for what IS included with this set, but zero stars for things that are supposed to be included but are NOT. Apparently this didn't happen with any of the other customer reviewers, but my set does not have the ""Behind the Music"" DVD. Instead, that slot is occupied by a ""Live at the Rainbow 1973"" CD, the very same one included in the ""Live Box."" Pretty sloppy quality control by the folks at Atlantic/Rhino! I haven't sent it back yet because I fear the replacement would just have the same problem.UPDATE: I sent the whole box back to Amazon and reordered it. The new one does have the Behind the Music DVD and appears to be complete. So hopefully what happened to me before was an anomaly. I have updated my rating to 4 stars to reflect my opinion of the set as intended."
5,Excellent!,"What can I say? I'm a huge Genesis fan and this box is amazing, hours and hours of great concerts and bonus materials. A must have for any Genesis fan!"
5,"""Sleepless"" sums it up","This album starts with a high-BPM bang and never lets up until the final track. This is club-ready synthpop with catchy choruses that had me singing along after just a listen or two. If I were to compare it to any other band, I'd say it sounds similar to Beborn Beton. In fact, if I didn't know any better, I would bet money that ""Sleepless"" WAS a Beborn Beton song. Personal favorite tracks are ""Regret,"" ""Come With Me,"" ""Sleepless,"" ""Just a Warning,"" and the fun, retro ""Everything and More."" The weakest track by far is ""Vampire."" If you like your synthpop with good, strong vocals and a heavy dose of beats, this is your album."
5,Wow!,"With all of the glowing reviews already linked to, there's not much more for me to add beyond, ""Wow!"" One of my friends turned me on to this book and loaned me his copy, and I'm really glad he did. This is a book for every computer scientist who wants to enhance his/her creativity. Every page is packed with ideas for using the computer to visualize the world of mathematics, and lovingly illustrated with great pictures to show you that each equation is not just a dry, boring, thing, but a gateway into a new (2-, 3-, or N-dimensional!) universe. This isn't a book to teach programming, so you'll have to go elsewhere for that, but if you already have a basic understanding of your favorite programming language, and know how to draw graphics to the screen, this book will provide many, many ideas, for that critical point when you stop and wonder, ""what can I do next?"" Highly recommended!"
2,Somewhat sensationalist and laden with innuendo. Does not pass even the minimum of serious scrutiny,"This book, written for the young person, purports to present these strange circumstances in an even-handed manner, but fails. The ""supernatural"" situations described are:*) The legend of Atlantis*) The legend of Bigfoot*) Flying saucers over New Hampshire*) The continuing legend of Harry Houdini*) The ghost ship ""Mary Celeste""*) The Loch Ness monster*) Abraham Lincoln dreaming of his own death*) The Bermuda triangle*) The famous ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast of a Martian invasion on Halloween, 1938.*) Astronauts performing ESP experiments from spaceThe evidence in support of the ""supernatural"" events presented in this book is lame, laden with innuendo and does not pass even the minimum of serious scrutiny. It is disingenuous, occasionally sensationalist and never truly addresses the real issues"

5,Not just for retirement,"Thinking of moving to Ireland for a few years, I have found this book helpful organizing the important steps to a successful extended stay there. Especially important to me were topics regarding cost of living, what sort of services I would miss, how I would deal with money issues and where the interesting sights are found. All of this is covered well. The book is made more enjoyable by it's inclusion of historical and cultural information. This book is packed with stuff that I couldn't find in any other books."
4,The intimacies of Rosa Montero,La Loca de la casa is Rosa Montero's most intimate novel about herself. We learn about the personal fantasies and details about the author through the many episodes that she experienced while writing many of her works. The book is an autobiography and partial biography about other authors that Rosa Montero talks about continuously throughout the book. Each chapter details a specific episode in Rosa's life that in some circumstances led her to put pen to paper. The episodes are told with enthusiasm and incomparable spirit as the author looks back at her life and her life as a writer. Once you begin to read the book you will quickly identify that La loca de la casa is Rosa Montero herself. I enjoyed the book immensely. It is a great journey through the soul of a terrific author.
3,"¿Una novela? Un ensayo o artículo, quizas.",El libro tiene varios interesantes vistas del proceso de escribir. También tiene numerosos relacionados cuentos de vivencias de autores.El libro puede estar bien para escritores pero tal vez no para lectores esperando una novela o una autobiografía.
5,A Bird Watchers Best,"My husband's parents owned an older edition of this book and its cover has become tattered with use over the years. I have looked at many and even purchased some other guides to North American Birds for my husband to use in our home. When he saw this one on the shelf he was very excited because he considers it the most authoritative, extensive, and appropriately organized guide to North American bird classification and identification. The pages are also thick enough that my children can use it without fear of ripping them or crumpling the corners. This is the best we've seen."
3,"Good, but","The book has an excellent selection of birds. However, the book is large for a bird book and doesn't tuck easily under your arm when you are busy looking at birds."
5,A Very Good Birding Book,"I have many different bird field guides, but always take this one along on my trips. I have read reviews by others that state this book is too big to carry in the field. Nonsense. I like having a bird book with all the North American birds between the covers. You never know when you may see a stray bird hundreds of miles away from its usual locations. The illustrations are very detailed. The raptors in flight section is another bonus of this book. Don't get me wrong, Sibley's books are magnificent, but this one is good as well. The only drawback is the sparrow section. While they are good, they don't do the birds justice. However, no book is perfect. My birding friends and I all agree that this is probably the best field guide at the moment."
1,The 5th Edition came out in 2006,The picture and description are for the 2002 4th edition.Look for the 2006 5th Edition.4th Edition was 4 stars when new; 5th Edition is 4+ stars now.Maybe if you order this they will send you the new edition?Maybe not?
3,Nice addition,Nice addition to your saw. If you have a repetative cut that's length falls between the closed and extended distance of your extension arm it's a benifit.
4,Comes with it,"The length stop works just fine, and you'll need two. Just make sure you check to see if your Bosch 4212 miter saw already comes with the length stops and crown stops. Mine did, so I ordered this a little prematurely."
5,Black Cherry Stain,"Stain seems to be of good quality. Used it on oak trim. Color has a slightly purple hue to it. More so than I thought, but color still worked for me."
4,"Great color, old can of stain","I love this color (Kona) and can't find it anywhere locally. There was a LOT of sediment on the bottom of the can and even after stirring and stirring and stirring, some of it was so hard and stuck to the bottom that I couldn't scrape it all off the bottom. I doubt it would have mixed in with the rest of the stain anyway. Must have been a really old can of stain? Still, the final color turned out great although I'm not sure if it actually matches what ""Kona"" is supposed to be considering I couldn't stir it all in. Not trying to sound completely negative because I really am happy with the results, but if you need to have this color match exactly with something else ""Kona"", you might want to buy from somewhere that has fresher cans."
4,Soothing and comfortable,"I love the spa. I use mine all the time. The wax on this model melts FAST. I gave it four stars only because it doesn't have a variable heat setting or timer. I replaced this one with a heat/timer model but I was still delighted to give this model away to someone who really wanted one. If you haven't used a paraffin spa you really must give it a try! It's wonderful and it feels so soothing on achy hands and feet. It comes with great booties, mitts, pad, brush, and lots of bags!"
1,Not What I Expected,One of the main reasons I ordered this spa was because of the first review that said this spa has a timer and can be set up to 12 hours in advance. Wrong. This spa does not have a timer. It only has an on/off switch.
1,What happened to this edition???,"The previous edition of this book is *far* superior to this edition. In this version it appears that all of the photos were digitally scanned (and some altered) with absolutely HORRIBLE results. Some are actually blurry!! All the photos are *extremely* darkened, the cover included. It's shown here on Amazon with the grass being 2 different shades of green due to the sunlight, but on the actual book the grass is only a single shade of dark green, with no sun lightening half of it. I thought I had a bad copy from Amazon so I checked out 3 different bookstores and found the same thing. This is really absurd that a publishing company could let these go out this way. Or do they not consider this a defect because it was intentionally ""cheapened"" this way? What a disgrace to a book that was truly a work of art. I suggest obtaining the previous out-of-print edition and leaving this one alone."
2,Richard's Review,The book was ok. The photo quality of some of the pictures was not the best and the text came across somewhat amateurish.
1,Disappointed,"While the photographs in the actual dream book are beautiful, I was terribly disappointed in the sparse listings of dreams. One of the first thing I looked for was ""stranger"" and there was nothing that I could find. I checked the word itself, and then I checked ""man"". Am I the only one who dreams about strangers? :) I also checked several other dreams that I had and found references for them, but not very detailed.The flashlight and pen are nice, but...I'd recommend it if you want a nice journal. But be sure and buy an additional book of dreams. Or, for that matter, buy a spiral bound notebook and another book of dreams. This one isn't anything to write home about. I had been *so* excited about getting it, and when it came today I was really disillusioned."
2,Maggie and the Law,"Judith Stacy is a fine writer. Having said that, Maggie and the Law fails to live up to her high standards. This reader found the pace slow, the situation a reach a female university grad in 1880's) and the heroine unlikeable.Ms. Stacy's books set in the late 1890's in southern CA (Written In The Heart and Married By Midnight) are far superior."
1,Squash has it right !,"LIVE is not something these manufactured no credibility, talentless bands do. Lipsync. They are dancing robots."
4,Easy to read but some deep insights,Very good and thought provoking book. Written in plain English and applicable to daily life but deep nonetheless.
1,SKIP IT!,"Ha! Now I read the reviews and thought, this can’t be all that bad, wrong, the kids were sneaky, rude and had bad mouths, this movie turned into an example of HOW NOT TO BEHAVE instead of a nice Christmas movie. It was purchased for my 3 year old son. We watched it once and threw it out!"
1,Terrible movie for Children,"My 4 year old son received this movie for Christmas. It is awful - the children are very direspectful to each other and to their parents. It' full of sarcasm and negative messages about Christmas, graitude and family life. I have thrown this dvd away."
4,toy sword,"I purchased this sword for my son. We usually buy cheap swords that break within a few days, but this one is still going strong. It's been about three weeks so far and it's still in one piece. He loves it."
1,Not as pictured on stock photo,"The stock photo on Amazon looks great compared to the real thing. When you have this sword in your hands, you will laugh at how fake it looks. The scabbard is a shiny plastic, the handle looks obviously fake because the color is just that bad. The blade itself is white plastic. Altogether, it's about $2 worth of materials and not worth the purchase even just for looks because it looks like crap."
3,Didn't meet my expectation,"The shears are made of stamped stainless steel. The Cricket shears in the same price range are made of forged steel, and they feel smoother than the Arius."
4,Interesting and Fun,This set consists of 3 audio cds and a CD-Rom disc. The basic idea in this teaching method is that you are given German words in the context of familiar English sentences and that by becoming familiar with the new words and slowly increasing your vocabulary you eventually listen and learn sentences and phrases in German alone. I do not rate this set as highly as the Michel Thomas Beginner's series simply because it is not as in-depth nor does it build language comprehension as solidly. A very good buy for the current used price of approx. $8. Tchuss!
2,"Good product, Bad UPS",I purchased the product through amazon and it was to be delivered through amazon prime. The product was shipped immediately by the seller and it arrived at the UPS facility close to me on time. It did not arrive at my address for 10 days while the tracking indicated that it was setting at the UPS facility waiting to be delivered. Amazon contacted UPS for me at about 6 days and they were told that UPS was very busy and that all ground deliveries were delayed until the express deliveries were completed because UPS was too busy at that time. I have since ordered the product again and it arrived in two days. It was as advertised and I will order it again.
3,"Mostly ""Frosted Mini-Wheats","I liked the product fine but wish there had been less sugar coated cereal and more Raisen Bran, Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Special K. The package contained mostly Frosted Mini-Wheats. They are tasty and so are the Fruit Loops and Frosted Flakes but I wanted a variety of more healthy cereals."
5,Good Deal!,This is a good deal if your family likes cereal and likes to have a good variety. These went quick in our household and there were no boxes left over!
5,Pink Baby doll Lingerie,"Although my wife doesn't look like the model, she did look pretty amazing and we had a great time.Would definitely recommend"
3,Great... when it works. :(,"I bought this baby a month or so ago. When I first got it, I was blown away! Finally, no more wrestling with tangled mouse cords! But the first time I had to change the batteries (which was much sooner than I expected), the battery connection wires inside the mouse got caught on the battery, and become dislodged. Its been loose ever since, and several times a week it will slip out of place, rendering my mouse completely useless unless I jiggle the batteries enough times that everything falls back into place. VERY frustrating for someone who spends 17+ hours a day at a computer! *When* its working, its a joy to use. But when its not, its a humungous hassle."
1,Broke within 6 months,"Everything installed pretty smoothly. However, while installing, I wondered how well the bag would stay on the screw at the bottom. 6 months later, that's where it broke. The plastic base the screw goes into broke, and now the bag won't hold any air. Not a good product, unless it had a better warranty (like [...], who has a lifetime warranty on their air bags)."
5,Execellant product,Was very easy to install and could level out my truck after my slide in camper was on.
4,watch that 2000lb skid,"96 Chevy 1500 short bed extended cab, installed for one year... I love these for towing my camper, easy to level no matter how the wife loaded it but, the ""Up to 2000 pounds of leveling capacity"" isn't quite right. I use this truck to haul wood pellets by the ton. When they are placed on the bed, I get about an inch off the bump stops at best with the bags at 100psi. It is a far improvement over stock however I would buy the larger set if I were to do it again. (Yes I do understand that doubling the rated payload of the truck is not recommended however a $200 set of bags is a slight bit cheaper than a one ton truck.)They do require constant checking as far as pressure is concerned. I keep them at 30psi when empty and regularly find they have slipped below the 20 mark."
1,Would never buy again from this company,I purchased from this company and one of the bladders kept leaking and rubbed a hole on the side of the bladder. Paid to have a replacement for the SO CALLED LIFE TIME WARRANTY and would be given a refund once defective part was returned to AIR LIFT. Four month later and I am still waiting for my REFUND. Just get the run around. I will never do business with AIR LIFT again.
2,"Worthy Goal, dismal execution","I must say that I was really excited when I got this book since learning MAX character animation has been a goal for a long time. Imagine my frustration when I started doing the exercises and I could make nothing in the first two chapters behave as described when following the instructions to the letter. There are so many glaring mistakes in the first two chapters I dont even have the patience to hammer through it. While New Riders books have been satsifying in the past, this one is a failure and I wish to express my extreme dissatisfaction to the authors and New Riders for not even bothering to issue an errata list to help people out who are having problems following the examples.This is not a cheap book, and the extreme technicality of the subject requires accuracy in writing and proofing. I am sure that nobody in the proofing team ever tried these exercises since as written they are impossible to execute."
4,Great book but hard to read,"This is a truly awsome book for Max character animators. At last we can share some of the secret techniques of the profesionals. I was particularly impressed with the info on IK and how to get the best out of it, plus the chapters on Biped and Physique are very welcome. On a sour note, this book suffers from the same problem that a lot of New Riders books suffer from - poorly written tutorials, sometimes its very difficult to finish a task because the description is obscure or a stage is missed out. Sometimes I wonder if they actually test these tutorials on ordinary users. Overall, it's a great book with loads of essential information but the poorly written tuts loses it a star."
1,Smells like a cross between air freshener and rubbing alcohol,This cologne smells cheap and sharp. I can hardly stand to be near my husband when he wears it. I would never buy it and am sorry that my husband did.
4,Satisfied Customer,"I have always habored a deep-seated affection for Grey Flannel. I used it when I got married in 1980, and still do today. I also turned my older son unto Grey flannel. This is an excellent fragrance!"
2,Not what I expected...,"I usually buy the Eau de Grey Flannel and I love wearing it _although the scent doesn't last very long _ but I had never tried the ""Grey Flannel"", so, since the ""Eau"" wasn't in stock, I ordered this product after reading a lot of good reviews about it.Well, I must say it's just too heavy and sweet for me...it doesn't have that fresh feel scent that I enjoy in the Eau de Grey Flannel.I wish I had tried it on in a perfume store before buying it..."
2,80's Revisited,"I guess I felt I needed to take a trip down memory lane.I used Grey Flannel in the 80's and it's everything it was back then.I don't know if this could be understood, but I would say it's warm, sweet and heavy.Unless you want to revive some memory via a cologne, I would not recommend this product."
2,Horrible,"My old roommate used to wear this stuff and it always stank like crusty mule taint. However for a cologne from the 70's with patchouli that really shouldn't come as much of a surprise. If you like it though, then go for it."
3,"Hecho en USA, no en Francia pero huele igual","No es el original de los 80's (hecho en Francia), este es hecho en USA, pero si es la misma marca deben mantener la misma fragancia.Es una fragancia fuerte y dura todo el día, el olor huele al estar cerca a la botella a pesar de estar cerrada y olía aún estando nueva y sellada. Definitivamente, es un olor que si te gusta, OK. si no te gusta pues compra nuevos perfumes que huelen medio dulces.Pensé que el frasco que compré (240 ml. u 8 Oz.) venía con spray, pues no viene, pero por $20 es un buen precio para una buena marca y un buen tamaño."
2,Read carefully,"Although the description says it is EDT the main title of this product says that it is a cologne. It is not a cologne, so read everything before you buy."
5,"Awesome, classic,Flannel","I used Grey Flannel in cologne, and changed colognes over the years. My girlfriend buys me new colognes every now and than, gut I miss the classics. After viewing Grey Flannel on Amazon, I immediately grabbed it. I love it man! Its not over powering, nor does it make me smell like a metro-sexual. Its old school, manly, and it comes in a huge * oz bottle!Thanks Grey Flannel,Mack from Mesa, Arizona"
2,Needed better description,"I purchased this item because of the great low price. The details online didn't give much more info than the title. When the item arrived, I realized that I had purchased a dated item. It covers the Jef nickel thru 2011 including proofs, but this book DOES NOT have any indication of the special designs issued in 2004-2006. Only the 3 normal P,D, and S spaces are included for each of these years. So now I have to purchase a replacement page or two."
1,What is the definition of a book review?,I have not even seen this book but was considering it. These so called book reviews seem to be a forum for ranting by those who don't like it. Does anyone know what an actual book review is?I can't actually rate this item as I have not seen it yet. I do remember the web site and feeling better knowing there were lots more people out there who were as appalled as I was.As far as these negative reviews are concerned I see nothing informative in them.
2,An ineffecient Jesus Christ Pose.,"Political feelings aside, I feel that this book does more to make people feel better for apologizing and less to make people do something about it. We flog ourselves, say we're sorry, and then it's back to American Idol and McDonalds.Trust me, the world's population knows that 49% doesn't leave for a large margin. If it were a 75%-25% Bush (or Kerry) Victory, I might see the reason for this book to exist. There isn't need to apologize for a lost election, but there is a need to do something if you feel compelled to apologize for it. Every one of those people in that book possess an ability to be able to change the country if they don't see it to be fit and for all intensive purposes, I hope they find that ability to do so.Nothing else can be really said about the book. If you want to argue politics, take it elsewhere. This space was meant for book reviews."
2,"I though it'd be cool, but it turned out to offend me","I bought this book kind of impulsively because I felt it would be a good momento -- a symbol that I was there, like having a burnt stub of a draft card from Vietnam. The rest of the world, I feel, has suffered under the 2nd Bush administration and I feel it is our duty as Americans to apologize. That's what I thought I was buying.Instead, I bought a collection of photos which seems to be a self-righteous and elitist circle-jerk. Many boast of being from a 'blue state', which no doubt would ease the woe of an Afghani mother whose son was bombed on his wedding day.I fully support the idea of 'Sorry, Everybody'. However, I feel that the book nevertheless has become a thing of poor taste."
1,"I, Too, Am Sorry","I'm sorry that Ted Rall can be credited with saying anything, no matter how vacuous, that speaks for Americans. I'm sorry too that anyone, anywhere, can think that these whining little babies are representatives of the United States. I'm sorry too that they think they can make such ridiculous apologies on behalf of America. The country spoke and they lost. These little babies should take their crying to their bedrooms and leave the important stuff to the adults."
1,This book is pathetic,"I am not a big fan of President Bush. However, my disagreements with him are primarily on domestic issues. I don't think we need to apologize to the world for freeing Afghanistan and Iraq, standing up for Israel, holding the UN accountable for its corruption and failure to do its job, or refusing to take seriously hypocrites like Chirac. To the contrary, the United States is owed an apology by the Islamofascists and their European appeasers. This book is a waste of paper and should end up in the remainder pile soon."
1,GARBAGE!!!!,"This book is full of BS! If you're into hating Bush, save your money and go watch that fat idiot's Michael Moron movie...it's the same liberal crap!!! This book deserves ZERO stars but zero stars wasn't offered as a choice."
1,We gonna get an apology for electing yet another warmonger?,"Don't hold your breath. Just checked out the website for this page and there's no apology for the drones bombing countries we're not at war with, the targeted killings which blow up neighboring families and turn even more people against us. President Obama is also the first president in history to declare the personal authority to assassinate anyone anywhere in the world and order hits on American citizens with no trial or even court review. Sorryeverybody.com has turned into the ""let's hang out"" page and ""we are the change.."" blahblah. So, I guess all that anti-war sentiment was just partisan politics as usual. Who cares who we're bombing on virtually every continent as long as the President looks cool on Leno and has a pretty ""D"" by his name."
1,Not sorry,"I'm not sorry that Saddam Hussein and his torture chambers have been eliminated. I'm not sorry that 25 million Iraqis are now free to govern themselves. I'm not sorry that, for the first time in Afghan history, millions of women are allowed to vote and to cast off centuries of persecution at the hands of ""superior"" males. I'm not sorry that the United States, under the leadership of George W. Bush, has stood up and defended herself against those who would murder thousands of innocent American citizens.I'm AM sorry that those responsible for this outrageous book would ally themselves with sworn enemies of their own nation, and would apologize to barbarians who would like nothing more than to chop off the heads off every American on earth."
5,Teach Peace,"I am a librarian and I am buying one for my library and donating one to my public library. I have watched the face of a person pick up this book, browse, and be strongly moved. Hundreds of American pictures with short messages apologizing to the world for the actions of the current president is persuasive and compelling. The story of how this book came to be is a testament to our country's ideals. It preserves a little piece of American history for future generations."
5,the best,i absolutely love backstreet boys they r my favourite band. No matter what any1 says they r the best singers and they show this greatly.I love them!!!!!
4,The goods,"Rather amazed to find this book unreviewed. There are many grand overviews of Chinese history, but this is one of the few books that takes you to the grassroots where the massive changes in Chinese society have been occurring. It also one of the few books written by China experts that avoids forcing the authors' views down the reader's throat. A unique piece of scholarship."
3,not all authors are included,"I am a grad student in Spanish. Not all the authors are included and not all of the information is there. Some authors have very detailed bibliography information and others have minimal information. I cannot trust this book and have had to double check online or with other books. Nothing has been wrong but many things are not included about a particular author that would be helpful in my research. I assumed it would be the ""bible"" of women writers but it isn't."
5,Highly recommended....,"This book is the best I've ever seen as a teaching tool on this subject. It assumes no prior knowledge, everything is very clearly written, and the illustrations make it simple to understand. (In fact, if you scanned through the book and only studied the pictures and read their captions, you would learn a great deal without reading the book's text.)If you choose to buy this book, it's money well spent."
1,Do NOT buy this book,"I had to buy this book for a Java course in college. That is the only reason I have it! I breezed through this book at the checkout and knew it was a mistake. The index is horrible. If you want to read a lot about Java then get this (personally, I'd rather read a Stephen King novel). If you want to learn Java buy another book. This book is not concise enough for me."
4,Different But Good,"Different from her previous novel, The Way it Happens in Novels but good. No Accident is all mystery with a little romance and a marked departure for her. Her penchant for quirky characters is a constant though."
5,Great Book!!,I was given this book for research for an essay. The book was very helpful. It was full of facts and enlightens the need for healthy nutrition.
4,for the health conscious,"Very happy with my used item. It was in good condition. Its an excellent book for the health conscious individual. Good value for money and delivery was prompt.Its just a pity that delivery is always the big expense. Otherwise no Complaints, very happy."
5,Food for Life,Excellent well written book that is user friendly. Easy read for the layperson and very helpful in wanted to change eating lifestyle. Highly recommend..
4,Food for Life,"Dr. Neal Barnard has convinced me that vegan is the way to go. I am ""test-driving"" this lifestyle to see if my cholesterol numbers go down as drastically as he predicts. I'll know in June, when I revisit my physician."
4,This book convinced me to become a vegetarian,I picked up Food for Life because I wanted to learn a littlebit more about nutrition. By the time I finished it I waswell on my way to improving the quality of my life with abetter diet. This book is filled with interestingabout how changing what you eat can improve your health andpreserve your youth!
4,A good but unreasonably sized book on semigroups,"This book is ok for those who want to study semigroups from a general point of view, as a branch of modern applied mathematics. However, with 574 pages of text, it has the disadvantage of being too much oversized. Also, for those who are interested in specific applications of semigroups, like partial differential equations (parabolic PDEs, stability, properties of solutions etc) this book might appear too vague. So, if you are going to create something new in those areas, your tool will be certainly Pazy's Semigroups, which is shorter, more comprehensive and more applications oriented, without compromising the theory part of the subject. Note that to read these books you need a good background in complex functions, functional analysis and spectral theory in Banach and Hilbert spaces (for the spectral theory I recommend A. Taylor's Introduction to Functional Analysis book, chapters 5,6)."
4,Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler,It is the perfect size and I really feel that it has helped me with this cold. This is my third cold this season and the last one was horrific. I decided to get the personal steam inhaler and just had my first experience with it. It was definitely a worthwhile purchase.
2,Good Steamer but made with material which tends to break,Its a good steamer but the attachment which hooks with the lower part broke after a few uses. Overall its a good product but not worth the price.
3,Good Steam not great,Fairly good steam output but not as useful as I thought. I will stay mostly with the NeilMed sinus rinse.
5,Works very well,This item works really well. My wife had a sore throat because of the dry air. This thing solved the problem in one day. Then the next week I installed a whole home humidifier. I still strongly recommend this though...it sure helps!
1,fell apart after one month,"Great for opening up your sinuses,but cheap plastic housing fell apart after one month. Made in China-do I have to say more?"
5,Vicks steam inhaler,This device works exactly as advertised and is easy to use except for the necessity of acquiring the pads for the supplied inhalant. I solved this problem by using the cotton cleaning patches for my replica 1804 Harper's Ferry 58 caliber black powder rifle as carried by Merriweather Lewis.
4,good product,"This is a good product, converts water in to steam fast, easy to assemble and disassemble. The operation is quiet and is quite portable. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because it gives less steam although it does not matter after 7-10 minutes because the steam is so hot that you have to keep your head higher. I am hoping it helps me out this allergy season."
1,where's the steam??,Kind of a disappointing product. Not much steam and not so easy to stand over and breathe because of the small amount of steam. In order to get much steam you really have to rest your face on the mask part which the instructions tell you not to do. I would not purchase again. The product itself seems well enough constructed.
4,Awesome Product,"I read the reviews good and bad before and purchased and I'mso glad I purchased the inhaler anyway. I was concerned aboutthe amount of steam the unit produced based on one review, and I assure you, his/her item must have been broken. The unit literally boils the water and produces alot of steam. As a matter of fact I turned the unit off because it got a bit too hot for me, then just enjoyed the leftover steam. I'm a singer and need a little compact unit like this to take with me. The face piece is so soft and very comfortable. Enjoy."
5,Headache Relief,"My wife bought this little steam inhaler for me a few years back because she thought it might help relieve my headaches after I noticed that a long, hot shower would bring me pain relief. A real miracle in my opinion! I don't know what kind of headaches I get (sinus? maybe) but whenever they're bad, I use this little guy, and I would say 95% of the time, within 20 minutes of inhaling the steam, the headache is GONE. I can't say this will work for your headaches, but it has for me and it lets me start functioning again. Just be careful when you first use it - you need to adjust the opening for the right amount of steam and gauge how close you get to the facepiece so you don't burn yourself, because the water is literally boiling. I'm ordering another one for the office. Good luck!"
3,Confused on the input voltage,The product description says it can be used with 110-240 V input power supply. But what is written on the product which I received is 110V. I am confused whether this can be used with an input 220V/50Hz power supply.
3,if i had to do again i would not purchase this.,"the vicks personal steam inhaler does put out steam even on the lowest setting but it gets to hot,and i'm not trying to burn my nostril,its not for me,if i had to do over again,i would not have purchase this,I will keep it for the simple fact i dont want the hassle of return it. give it a try it might work for you."
5,Nasal Therapy!,I recently had nasal surgery and my healing time was a bit longer than anticipated due to the fact that my nasal septum perforated and the flow of air through that tiny hole really dried out my nose! My ENT recommended I purchase this product to help keep my nasal passages moist. I think this tiny contraption produces a very powerful flow of steam! The plastic face shield is comfortable and I love the menthol scented disk! Happy so far! Let's hope my nostrils agree ;o)
1,Vicks Steam Inhaler - do not buy it,It barely produces any steam. The small amount of steam produced is further reduced by the poorly engineered vents. You are better off putting a pot on a stove or hot plate. Do not buy this product.
4,You can use it with oil essences,"I didn't buy the pads instead I bought an Eucalyptus and Mint oil essence because is cheaper and you can regulate the amount of essence you like. As recommendation, when you use the inhaler with oil essences you have to aware of the residual hot oil when the water is boiled because this oil spatter so is better to turn it off immediately. Finally, is good to clean this residual to avoid smells."
2,Ok,"It's 'OK' for what it is. It could produce more steam. Also, you have to have your neck and head bent over for 15 or so minutes straight until all the water evaporates. It would be nice to be able to lay back and inhale. Besides those down falls it works good for what it is."
3,"too small not,enough steam","its a little too small for an adult male, and it doesn't produce enough steam to break up any congestion that one may have. It doesn't work for me or my daughter very well."
1,The plastic fell apart,I've had this product from Amazon for about 5 weeks. The plastic started deteriorating the first week. Every week more and more of it fell off. Today (12/05/2012) it became unusable since there was too little plastic to hold it together. I thought I should I look into returning it but found I had missed the return window by two days. From other people's reviews I guess I just got a defective unit. But I am very disappointed.
1,Bad and burning steam,It is giving bad burning steam. The steam is not very clear. It is all burning steam. Would not recommed this product
1,Frustrante,"Quando vi o anúncio desse aparelho, tinha a informao de que outras pessoas também compravam o Vicks VapoSteam Cough Suppressant. Entendi que era o produto que se colocava no aparelho. Ao ler as instrues de uso percebi que no era possível usar nenhum produto inalante. O aparelho é só para produzir vapor."
1,disappointed,"I purchased the inhaler based on the good reviews. The first time I tried it I got badly burned, when my 5 year old walked into the power cord. This means I cannot use it when my kids are around.The second time I made sure they were in bed before I tried it. After 5 minutes I put a pan of water on the stove, boiled it, and used that with a towel to inhale the steam. The experience with the pan was 200% better than with the Vicks. With the Vicks only my nose and mouth get warm versus my whole face and forehead with the pan (sinuses are located in your forehead!).Breathing in through your mouth with the Vicks (when your nose is congested) will get you much cold air from the side openings.My lips, being closer to the steam opening, felt hotter than my nose, whereas with the pan I got a much more evenly spread of the heat.I returned the Vicks and will be returning to using an old fashioned pan again."
3,Disappointed in Amazon again,"This is the 2nd time I have ordered from Amazon & my 2nd disappointment. Maybe it's just the brand, but it looked like it was used. There are actually pieces of something in or on the plastic, that don't seem to come off. It also smells like my chemistry lab at school, kind of gross. I wish it was a tad bit bigger."
1,Great ornament,"We ordered two Vicks Steam Inhalers and they arrived quickly and in good condition. Unfortunately we live in Australia (240 volt) and they came with an American plug (not a big problem) and American voltage - 120 volt (major problem). We emailed the service centre and received no response (zilch, nothing, not even sorry we can't help). So if you would like two ornamental Vicks inhalers please drop me a line."
1,Useless waste of money,Do not buy this it's a crap... It's tiny and steam it's a joke may be used as a toy for kids.do not waste your money.
4,easy inhaler,Easy to use. Easy to clean. Best part is that your eyes are not in direct line of the steam which makes it easier to stay over the steam and get the benefits of breathing in to help your sinus problems.
2,Disappointing.,"First off, I had high hopes based on the reviews but am largely suspicious some of them are phony. The amount of steam generation on this unit is very disappointing. Maybe it's just me but it did little to open my air passages."
4,Vicks Personal Steam Inhaler,Was pleased with the Vicks Personal Steam inhaler. Great for me as I was getting laryngitis and it did the trick. Am back to full voice. Only thing is that it was a little small.
2,Interesting Apparatus!,An interesting apparatus. Which in my opinion is being made non-effective because of it's material. It smells when heated.
2,The steam is too dispersed; and too hot,"This doesn't really work well. The steam is too dispersed so you don't inhale much, and it's also very hot. It also dries out your skin."
3,Good but limited,"I bought this and found it easier to use than standing over a pot of steam. However, it does not have a medicine cup.Also getting it to the right height is difficult. I did not want to bend over very much.I now realized that I should have spent a little more money to get an inhaler than has a medicine cup.Does allow for a ""ring"" for vapor, but I could not find it at the store I bought this at."
2,didn't like it,"I didn't like it, it was very uncomfortable. It didn't seem to help any. I was disappointed in it, I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
3,Not bad but not gret,The item works as described but that being said the amount of steam doesn't seem to be as much as is needed for a real solid effect.
5,Great,This is a great item to have around the house. It really helps when you are congested in your head. I used it while I was sitting in the chair watching tv it works great.
4,Steam Inhaler,"Just received the steam inhaler. Important to have patience with it while it heats up, once heated up it gets pretty hot - was a little hesitant about wanting to put whole face on it at first - once convinced I was okay it was kind of nice. It seems to work okay, will need to try out more before can leave better feedback. Currently nasal passages are clogged, may need to use menthol pack to help break through. Little pricier than wanted to pay for the little unit, however will give it a try for longer period before I make my final decision. Important not to plug into extension cord, pulls little power in order to heat up, wouldn't leave plugged in so can prevent a fire hazard, okay when using as long as can keep an eye on. Will know more after using for a longer period of time if like."
4,Dual-Voltage!,"When I ordered this, I wasn't even focused on the fact that it runs on 110V and 220V current. It was a nice surprise to find out that I could use it abroad without a transformer. (Most consumer durable goods are 110V only.) The steam is very hot, and I found I could use it only on the lowest settings. Also, the fact you have to lower your face onto the unit is a minus. If the clear plastic piece were to be lengthened and molded into a shape that would allow the user to put his face into it while holding his head level, that would be a better design."
2,Vicks steam inhaler,"I returned the product because it would not allow me to use the oils recommended for sinus infections. Perhaps for more mild sinus problems, the product would be fine."
4,Buy this unit if you are going to have sinus surgery,Talk with your doctor to be sure it is ok with him/her.If you are scheduled for sinus surgery you are going to be required to do a sinus irrigation every eight (8) hours after the surgery. This unit helps tremendously. I used it in the past for colds so I had one on hand. It boils water so it is dangerous and you can get burned if the water spills on you. Good luck with your sinus surgery.
4,Great product,"I had to use this for my sinus problem while I was pregnant.It's very soothing, and my face was very moist after the use too. It's very compact and very cheap for this quality of product. 4 stars just because it's easy to spill the water when you are carrying this."
2,Not that great!,"I found that there wasn't enough steam produced to be effective! I have bad sinus allergies and my doctor recommended I inhale steam either in a steam room or through a device to help cleanse my sinus cavities.When I saw this on Amazon I thought it would be perfect; small, light weight and I could really isolate the steam to my nasal area.Well it doesn't produce enough steam for anything!! I don't know how any of the people who have reviewed the product were able to loosen congestion. It was a complete lack of money and now it is just stored under a cabinet somewhere.If you are looking for a product that produces a lot of steam, then SKIP THIS ONE!!!"
2,Not so great,Good if you want to use it on the go i.e. while travelling. The upper cap is loose and I spilled some hot water on myself accidently. I stopped using the product after that as I find it very unsafe to use especially around kids.
2,lasted 2 weeks,used it 3 times a day for 3 minutes each on a low steam setting. made sure that there was enough water in it before I used it.usually 1 fill for the day. after 2 weeks it suddenly stopped putting out steam. another made in china junk bit the dust.
3,its ok,I bought this for my son. Its very easy to spill hot water inside. You can't rest your face on it because it gets too hot. I wish that I had spend more money and bought inhaler which could control the steam temperature.
3,Not good enough,The steam is not strong enough. I felt little relief from my sinus problem. It never cleared my nasal congestion.
3,Careful not to spill if you DO hold it by hand.,"Yes, yes, the instructions do say to keep on a flat solid surface. Yea, right..! If you're feeling like crud, you're going to want to stick your face in this while lying back on the sofa or something. And you can do it. It works. But you need to be careful. The water you will spill on you if you tilt it is hot. Not scalding, but hot enough to make you jump.So other than that, the steam is really good. I like that I can use it without the medicated pad. I tried it, and that WAS nice, but more something I'd consider if I was sick with a cold and not just allergies. I imagine as the winter goes on that this will become a major item at my home and we'll need ot invest in a second one."
1,Really?,"I bought one of these thinking it'd be great for my dry throat. I got it and I have to say I feel kind of stupid. All it does is heats up water. For 30 bucks I was expecting something like an aroma therapy machine with loads of included materials. Nope, it comes with 1 scented ring and you can't load it with any kind of oil. My advice is just go heat a pot of water and stick your head over it. It'll do the exact same thing as this but probably better."
1,The steam is way too hot,Even on the lowest setting the steam is so hot that it feels like it's burning my face.
3,Does skinning a stinky dead carcass relate to airlines?,This was a good way to learn about the history of Latin American aviation from someone who was there. The story of how he got there was not as interesting as what happened once he got there. His recollection of events was excellent and you could tell he enjoyed every step of the way.
4,"A ""passionate"" creview","This book is an inspiration for people that want to follow what they feel passion for.One of its highlights is the fact that we are not only introduced to the successful episodes, but also the author describes clearly some of his ideas that never saw the light.This ""transparency"" makes it even more attractive, and some of the terms he uses are really interesting -""Corporate Jungle"" is a good example.I recommend this lecture, not only to Airline passionate but also to anyone who believes in pursuing their ""passion"", with the ups and downs this means."
4,"Booth, the Hemingway of Latin America's airline industry","Booth, the Hemingway of Latin America's airline industry. A unique, down to earth and unconventional personality; who has lived his airline-life to the fullest with passion, dedication and creativity. Definitely ahead of his ""times"", sometimes against his own professional ""well being"", an innovator by nature; a true Bolivarian scholar...SANDRO FRANCINI Managing Director Bridges Capital Ltd. From Nairobi, Kenya (East Africa).14th Nov 2000."
3,Background to the current state of Latin American Aviation,"Bobby gives us the backgroung to better understand the current state of Latin American aviation and the forays of persons like Ed Acker into Caribbean Aviation. In addition as someone who has worked with Bobby over the last five years I now better understand the individual, his philosophy and his absolute commitment to Latin American and Caribbean Aviation."
2,no easy instructions,"I purchased this monitor just last week and at first it appeared to be everything I wanted, but the hardcopy instructions that came with it are HORRID and the CD is no better! I have to assume that the manufacturer thinks anyone with a computer is some sort of computer whiz. All I know is that I am not getting the picture I thought I would and there is absolutely no way to contact help... no email help, 1-800 help..nothing! There isn't even a way to register the darn thing. Should have let the gurus at Best Buy or Radioshack help me buy a different style, instead of flying by the seat of my pants. Oh...and, the three year warranty that really appealed to me is viturally useless because the information gives the buyer no clues as to how apply for it should this monitor stop working. This may be a total rip-off; I'm beginning to wonder...."
5,"Wonderful, well-researched material.","This great work by Norma Lorre Goodrich has been absolutely invaluable to my research into such areas as the Oracle at Delphi, the Cumaean Sibyl, the legendary Amazons, and many other topics for which information is hard (at least) to find. Ms. Goodrich uses resources to their full extent. At times it seems to be amazing that she has been able to combine so many ancient materials to come up with valid, comprehensible portraits of histories that would be forgotten without her scholarly persistence. This is a book that I recommend to all scholars. I've used it to great extent on my web site, Morgana's Observatory, THE only source of such material that I've been able to find. Ms. Goodrich brings ancient history (herstory) to life!"
5,Stunning!,"Great collection by this often overlooked Swedish band. Holds up well to the likes of contemporaries The Pretty Things (S.F. Sorrow), The Action (Rolled Gold), The Remains (Remains), and The Zombies (Odessey and Oracle). Highly recommended!"
1,A one-sided view of Y2K.,"This video uses old information and alarmist predictions about Y2K. Tries to tie Y2K into Biblical prophecy. Worst case scenarios are presented after which we are told ""not to panic."" Definitely not for children and I would not recommend it to anyone unless they are also familiar with the most recent progress which has been made on Y2K. Reviewed by an evangelical Christian."
4,"This Video Is Clear, Concise, And Accurate!",As a Christian and a computer technician I found this video to be excellent. The moderator clearly explained the Y2k issue in language that all could understand. He also tied events into the scriptures in a very articulate manner. This video is for the novice as well as the advanced. But even more important - the Christian!
2,Yawn!,"This CD does not deliver! It's bland beyond words. It has not one song that really spin my wheels. How dare the makers even refer to this as house music. You could have this playing in the background at a social mixer. But if you are true househead, if you like some bumpin' base and some mega-soulful singing, then you will be disappointed there. There's hardly any disco to it either. Maybe I'm spoiled because I'm a Chicagoan and Chicago is house's birthplace. Still, this shoddy imitation does not do justice to this amazing dance genre."
5,Great Camera,"What an outstanding Pick...Very easy to use. The packaged software is just great, anyone (computer smart or not) can use it. The pictures taken so far have been great, easy to download to the Kodak soft ware and easy to print..You will just love the one touch Kodak docking station.What a great idea..."
1,BATTERY LIFE = 0,"This camera takes nice pictures but you will only have a few minutes to take them after charging the battery. About 10 minutes or so is all I could get out of a fully charged battery.I called Kodak about this problem, they walked me through the steps to make sure I was charging the battery correctly (how stupid do they think I am?). Then they told me there must be a problem with the charging dock. Took the dock back to the store and exchanged it for another one. Same problem! Called Kodak again, this time they tell me it must be a problem with the camera itself so back to the store to exchange the camera for another one. Same problem!I finally ended up taking it back, getting my money refunded and buying a comera from a different manufacturer."
2,Disappointed,"This camera is very easy to use. I took it out of the box and was taking pictures within 10 minutes, but when I down loaded them, many were blurry. The quality was poor. I thought 2.2 mega pixels was really going to be something great, but as many of the other reviews have said, the pictures did not turn out good at all. I am very disappointed with this camera and will be trading it for something else."
4,"Great camera, great price","I've had my 3500 over a month now and love it. I have experienced some of the problems that other's have commented on (blurriness with zoom...) but for a $300 camera I think it does everything it was expected to do. If I want to make sure I don't miss a moment, that is what film is for. But for just snapping away and not worrying about film (i have the 64mb Viking card) it is great.I have experienced one problem that is annoying, while taking pictures it seems the camera gets confused about the internal memory and the flash card, even though I am set on 'auto', for flash card first, then internal. So I will show 398 pics left, then it will be 41, or such. I can go through the menu and find the pics, but sometimes I have to pop the flash card and reinsert and start up again. I wrote to Kodak but they only sent back the standard support email."
5,Great Camera!,"2.2 megapixels for $300 is a great deal! So much for the lack in zoom, you're not paying for the zoom. I was surprised at how good of quality that these pictures were. With two other digital camera owners in the house, I have been able to compare this camera with both the Canon Elph, and the Nikon CoolPix, which are both about $200-$300 more in price. And the resolution compared significantly. If you are looking for a great camera at a low price, definately get this camera, it's worth the extra price of the dock. Have Fun!!"
2,Blurry pictures Is what this camera produces.,"Hi, I just purchased this camera this past weekend and after taking numerous pictures, over 50 and mostly indoors I am very disapointed. On average 1 picture out of every 5 are acceptable.I was however impressed with the outdoor pictures, even on the lower resolution setting it produced a nice picture. I however purchased this camera for the upcoming birth of our twin boys and with out a doubt this will not be the camera I will use, I will have to take it back a go with another brand.It's too bad though, 2.2 megapixels for under three hundred bucks sure sounded like a steal, I guess It wasn't after all."
2,Kodak camera,Camera was more/less as expected..Generally works.. butLCD screen is in poor shape.. Almost useless trying to use as viewer..Need to upload photos to computer to see them..The photos are ok.. but it's trial and error in shooting them.You get what you paid for..
3,Kodak camera,"I bought the Kodak camera and the dock for my wife for Christmas two years ago. It is easy to operate and to load the pics into the camera, but as other reviewers have stated it uses a lot of power. The docking system seems to help to keep the batteries charged. A minor annoyance is that sometimes the shutter does not open when I turn on the camera. I give it a few good whacks with my hand and it will open. Not high tech, but it works. My friend's camera did the same thing and Kodak, with some prodding, fixed it for a modest fee. My wife uses it for work and in general it is a rugged camera. I may upgrade in the future, but for now I will keep it."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Pros: Cheap price, durable (I have dropped it often, and it still works fine), 2 megapixelsCons: All pictures look unfocused, batteries get eaten up quickly (try 20 minutes), only digital zoom which is horribleI recommend the Canon A60, or if your willing to step up to 3 megapixels, get the Canon A70, which is the best camera for your money."
2,Very Disapointed in Quality!,"Well, after having the Olympus D-460 for about 3 months,I saw the Kodak camera on the... web site and noticed that it was 2.2 megapixels. I had sort of been looking for a 2+ megapixel camera so I ordered it. When it arrived, I was disapointed as quick as I took it out of the box. From the plastic casing to the super light weight of the camera was the first thing. Just the controls and the feel of the camera make you think of a toy! Not having an optical zoom is another setback. When you use the digital zoom through the LCD the image gets almost unrecognizable. It pales in comparison to the Olympus D-460 as far as features, construction (the 460 is rock solid!) and LCD quality. The only thing it has better is the megapixels and that is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. You really get what you pay for here. If all you care about is getting the megapixels then this may be for you. If not, look elsewhere."
2,too much hype,"I've seen this camera all over the place. Frankly, I've been very disappointed with it. While it is fairly easy to use, the picture quality is very poor - even with high resolution. Quality is extremely sensitive to light conditions and you can always count on a blurly picture if you use the zoom."
2,Disappointed with camera,"I recently purchased the DX3500. I liked many aspects of the camera- it is easy to use, the picture quality is good and the user manual is helpful. Connecting to the computer, however, is not an easy task. I purchased the easy dock and have not been able to transfer pictures even once using the easy dock. I have transferred pictures connecting the camera directly to the computer, however, the transfer software only seems to work 50% of the time. Based on my experience with the DX3500, I would recommend that shoppers pass on the DX3500 and continue to shop around."
1,Horrible print image quality,"If you just want a camera to email pics, this is a fine camera. I purchased it, however, to take pictures of my newborn son and email them to family so that they could print them out and frame. I have been unable to get ANY acceptable printed images from this camera. I've tried all sorts of lighting, indoors, outdoors, and even running the pictures through Photoshop filters. I could not even print out a 3"" x 5"" picture that was not grainy. DO NOT purchase this camera if you want to be able to print your images. a TOTAL waste of money. I am COMPLETELY disappointed."
1,This product is useless,"I bought this product for my husband for Father's Day. He read the directions to the letter and the camera just does not take good pictures. They are out of focus, very blurry and we used it for my daughter's kindergarten graduation and I think we got 3 good pictures out of about 60 which is really bad now we can not get that day back! I am extremely disappointed with this product I expect more out of Kodak"
3,No Batteries,"This is a great camera that is easy to use and the dock makes downloading, E-mailing & printing a snap. However, you canot buy extra batterie packs anywhere including direct from Kodak ( they are on back order all the time )"
2,very average camera,"I bought this camera 3 years back and its a plain simple point and shoot camera with a fixed lens and you cant adjust anything. It has no optical zoom, no video recording, etc. but thats what you pay for. Picture wise the camera shoots beautifully and the colours come out really nice and natural. Its flash is pretty bad with flash shots coming out dark. I have taken decent 6x4 prints even with the lower resolution. The power on/off switch is really horrible and flimsy. It broke after few months of use and I had to get it repaired. After that my computer never recognises the camera and I have to use a card reader to transfer photos.I wouldnt recommend this camera even to a first timer even though its very very simple to use. Its just too flimsy and featureless."
2,Not Satisfied,"At the moment i am very tired, having spent 6 hours trying to update the software to the new Easy share. I have had nothing but trouble since updating to Easy share. I owned a Dx3500 and then a DX3600, which I was satisfied with until I upgraded the PC to Windows XP. Now I have the latest Kodak LS753, and the software CD included will not install and even when i down load from the net I get a message saying that there is an error. I have checked for virus, turned off all programs etc. and still no luck. I have never had such problems and I will be certainly returning to the shop with the camera and exchanging it, and I will be letting everyone know the problems. I feel so angry that I have wasted so much time."
2,I outgrew this camera very quickly,"Don't be fooled by this camers 2.2 Megapixels. It may be able to shoot at high resolution, but it applies to much compression to the images it shoots to make them fit onto the card. The result is that the images apear grainy when fully zoomed in. Also, the digital zoom only enhances this graininess. It looks like someones merely cropped the image and then enlarged it to full size (blurry and low quality). This camera also is terrible for film exposure (I know it doesn't have film, but still). My pictures are always come out to dark or too light and I have to use photoshop (Making copies of layers and setting them to screen or multiply) to set the values right. The only plus about this camera is that it has a good OS, and has the novelty of being able to hook up to a TV. I would reccomend stepping up to Nikon Coolpics 775 (about 80 bucks more) because there is a huge chance you will outgrow this camera like me."
3,"Great ease of use, if thats ALL you like","I was pumped to finally get a digital camera with 2.2 megapixels for under [...]. who wouldn't be? I was even more excited because I would be able to use it on the North Slope of Alaska, taking pictures of my job experience and the amazing wildlife surrounding me. I took a few pictures, some were great, and some were blurry. I figured it was my own inexperience with the digital world. Yet, when I found myself surrounded by what was estimated to be 2,000 caribou, I felt confident that I would capture every great image opportunity. As I loaded the pics on my computer, I was extremely dissapointed. 2 out of 20 pictures turned out good, the rest... blurry! I loved the camera, but it took bad pictures. Fork out the extra [...] and buy something nicer that will actually capture your memories."
2,Bad quality/prize ratio,"The first impression i've got with this camera is weakness. Seems that if camera falls to the floor (more usual than you 're thinking),it'll be destroyed in million pieces. Plastics are bad and termination isn't good.Another big drawback is that it hans't any kind of optical zoom or in defect intechangeable lenses. The digital zoom is the least chance because you'll loose resolution and quality. A wide angle lens could be a good optional item.The photos aren't awesome, too dark and automatic modes are terrible ... Zoom is underpowered.I've got an SLR and the results and i dind't find any digital with their performance ( my SLR is a Yashica FX-3 , full manual). The best digital camera i've seen is the new nikon 5000 but for that prize i could manage a Contax Aria with Zeiss lenses."
2,Not a good package.,"I usually like Kodak's digitals, but this one has a strange mix of features that should render it unacceptable to both amateurs and to advanced users. To wit, the image quality is very good, boasting 2.1 megapixels of resolution, enough to handle not only web-based photography, but enlargements of up to 8"" x 10"" as well. However, this is completely offset by a fixed-focus lens and no optical zoom (it has a digital zoom, but these are not nearly as useful). The rest of the features are acceptable, including memory & expandability, flash, battery useage & USB connectivity. Kodak is selling an optional 'docking station' for this camera that allows for 'easier' downloading of images to your PC, but any memory card reader (Viking, or SanDisk) is simpler, cheaper and more versatile."
4,A good product at a good price,"I purchased the DX3500 to replace a Polaroid 640x480 digital camera, since that point I have been very pleased with the Kodak. The ease of use, picture quality and battery life with 2 AA batteries has been very impressive. The Cons to this camera are lack of optical zoom, and lack of exposure control."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"I bought this album with high expectations b/c i love Fresh's style, he doesnt try to be anything that he isnt like most rappers today and as far as producing goes Fresh has got it down and i love pretty much everything he's produced but as far as the rapper side of it i love the light-hearted humor to his lyrics its definitely somethin different besides the constant talk of murder and gangs. Overall this is an album that alot of people should like definitely a good change from all the hardcore style and great production as usual from Mannie."
5,Fresh is Fresh,"You might take a look at this and say does he really need 30 tracks? Well he may not need all 30 tracks but I'm telling you that you'll like every track on here. His lyrics are good and at times humorous on this and his beats are catchy and original. And his guest stars compliment him perfectly, exepct lil wayne who absolutly KILLS it on Waynes take over # 1 and #2. Weezy stepped his game up from Tha Carter which I didn't think he could do. But this cd is very entertaining and is deffinitly worth buying."
1,Whak,"This cd sucks. I listened to it a couple of times trying to convince myself that it was good, but its just so weak. Mannie is a nasty producer but this album was a dissappointment. Dont buy this, buy old B.G. Wayne, and Hot Boy$ if you dont already have it."
4,IT'S HOT,MANNIE MAN WHATS ON UR MIND?ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND WE'LL BE WAITING ON THE NEXT ALBUM HURRY
5,FRESH MUSIC,THIS IS MY FAVORITE CD OF ALL THE WONS I HAVE BOUGHT THIS YEAR I LISTEN TO IT EVERY DAY. IT HAS THE BEST SONGS ON IT. BUT U DONT HERE IT ON THE RADIO MUCH SO IF U WANT TO HERE THIS CD UR GONNA JUST HAVE TO BUY IT. BELIEVE ME ITS WORTH IT.
3,Had its Good Parts,umm yeea im not from the south.................and i liked ittop 51. Chubby Boy2. How We Ride3.Day In The Life (Cadillac Doors)4.We Fresh5.Fight Song
2,big disapointment,"This album has good production,it lacks bangers.It has a couple good songs both lil wayne tracks are hot david banner helps the album but I was hoping for something great you let me down funny fat douuuu"
3,Korman Shows Some Flashes of Old Brilliance,"While certainly better than Korman's other 1999 offering, Stars From Mars, Nosepickers from Outer Space is not as good as Don't Care High, I Want to Go Home! or the Bruno & Boots series. The original title of this book, Alien Exchange Student, gives some idea of what it's about- an elementary schooler's student that he hosts turns out to be from outer space. While the story is reasonably original, many references to current events/people will hurt the book's lasting ability. Furthermore, while the book definitely has many laughs, some of the stretched humor regarding clothing doesn't work."
5,"Best Female Guitarist, and among the best songwriters","If you haven't yet heard Anne, I can't recommend her three cds enough. Can't wait for the new one in September with help from Lucinda, John Doe, and others! Don't miss her live either. She is a tremedous live performer too.If she is NOT a major star soon, there is no justice in the world. But then again, this is the world of Mariah, Britney, etc... So Anne will probably remain a great artist, making fantastic music, and barely heard by anyone :-("
3,Roll,"When I first heard the title cut on a drive through a Midwestern college town, I thought ""Hey this chick knows how to rock!"" In reality the rest of the album has too many folk/pop songs. There is credit due for some good guitar work."
1,cant import it on a computer !,dont buy this if u want to add it to yer computer or i tunes- only 2 songs show up for import !!!sucks !!!!
4,Nice Gift,this cd is an excellent price so it would make a nice gift for a friend who doesn't know that much about the Backstreet Boys. Featuring live tracks like Larger Than Life and Back To Your Heart and other tracks like All I Have To Give and Its True its a must have for any fan
4,Plight of the Common Man Recognized,"I would recommend ""Anthem for the Common Man"" to any fan of Battlefield Band, but I don't think it would be the best introductory recording.The ballads ""The Old Changing Way"" and ""The Port Of Call"" are both very poignant, and are two of my favorite songs on this recording.Some of the instrumentals are a bit heavy on synthesizer at times, but are still very enjoyable."
5,Delightful Scottish Folk Music,"This band is wonderful to listen to, a perfect blend of old scots music and new. This album contains fine slow ballads, rousing dance songs, and lively jigs. This is truly one of Battlefield Band's best works."
2,From a Graduate Student,"This book is full of mistypings, spelling errors and grammar errors. It annoys you with all of its sentences. If only the authors didn't use the word ""respectively""... The book repeats itself, goes in deep details with the simplest tasks any computer science student should know, and passes the more advanced ones without proper explanations. It leaves you with the impression that the authors do not fully understand what they are speaking about. In some parts, it is as unscientific as a scientific textbook can be. For example, in explaining white balance procedure of a ccd camera the book tells you to turn the camera towards a white object and press the white balance button.Despite these failures the authors are fairly successful in giving a comprehensive picture of what 3D shape recovery requires and how it can be implemented, hence the second star."
4,My jury is out on this complex opus,"Reading ""The Ambassadors,"" I was awed by the subtletly of emotion and social gesture James was able to describe. Clearly here was a crafted that had been years in the honing, and I appreciate the book's liberation from the plot-heavy mechanics of earlier books like ""The Portrait of a Lady"" and ""The American."" Everything is only subtly insinuated; whole lives can hinge upon half-meant gestures or long-buried social prejudices. In this way, the book has some of the wistful tone of ""The Age of Innocence,"" but more depth if less elegant prose.The prose is the thing -- James was dictating by this time (how on Earth does one dictate a novel?), and it shows. His chewy ruminations and meandering, endlessly parenthetical sentences are hard to digest. I think James went too far in his late style, and ""The Ambassadors"" might have benefited from a sterner editor. Still, this is an important book, absolutely worth the read."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"Do not, under any circumstances, buy this edition of The Ambassadors. It's impossible to read and impossible to judge what the real book is like because the formatting - paragraphs, in particular - is completely messed up, making dialogue, in particular, virtually incomprehensible (I discovered this because I was having such a difficult time following the writing - and I adore Henry James - that I compared the Kindle edition to a ""legitimate"" edition). No wonder all the other reviews refer to the ""complexity"" of the prose, etc. This edition is an absolute rip-off and an insult to the author, one of the great masters of the English language. Amazon should be ashamed of itself, and this edition should be taken off the market immediately."
2,Perfect Sleeping Elixer,"Whenever I cannot get to sleep I simply reach for this book and, voila, within a few sentences I am drifting off. James wrote dialog that no one in the world has ever uttered. When the topic is obvious and simple, his characters question one another intensely trying to determine what it is they are talking about. When the topic is strange and hidden, amazingly they all understand each other perfectly and silently. If you are into extremely cerebral, S L O W M O V I N G, non-plot, non-action novels, this is for you. Unfortunately I prefer characters who speak as normal folks do, who motivate in their lives, who don't think themselves to death and who are real. I am truly sorry that HJ considered this his finest work. I much prefer his earlier, more accessible and likeable works such as Daisy Miller."
5,A must have for the mysterious rider,"This is extreamly easy to chang out with the clear one. Now, I am a cool rider."
4,Music for the heart,"Recently, I saw the movie, Giuseppe Piccioni's ""Light of my Eyes (Fuori dal Mondo)"" and just fell in love with the score, written by Einaudi. It's just a simple score, a theme played mostly on piano that runs through the movie. But it touched me, had such an emotional effect. So far I've been unsuccessful at getting a copy of it, if it even exists. ""Echoes"" was my attempt, my hope at capturing something similar...and though it doesn't attain the same emotional hold as that simple theme from the movie, it is still beautiful music...it too is able to stir emotions.And that's what comes across in the music...emotions. It will carry you away and take you places, memories that you want to relive. And that's a nice thing, a beautiful thing for music to do. And based on that, I reccomend it..."
2,Not my thing,"I see that everything this man produces gets rave reviews. But I'm just not feeling it. Sorry. This is my review and I don't get out of it what others appear to. My fifteen year old daughter will listen to this album all evening and she loves it, so does my wife. They never get tired of it.But to me, much of his music is same old same old. It's like I have been listening to the same rumbling phrases all night and they just go on and on, never changing or getting anywhere. For me Steve Reich does a much better job of this repetitive stuff.I recently saw him in concert in San Francisco, the audience loved him. I feel like some self indulgent guy with a piano amused himself for more than an hour, at my expense, while I was waiting for a pianist to come and play music instead.Not my thing."
1,This is such a pleasing CD,"I recently purchased this CD and haven't been able to stop listening since. The music is so beautiful that often tears come to my eyes. Imagine my thrill when I realized that Einoudi is the pianist for many pieces that I often adored from previous musical compilations, all the while unaware who the composer was. This CD has all my favorites and more!"
5,Digital Adventure 2!,"This is an awesome game, you can digivolve to mega, mess around with DNA Digivolves, get more Digimon, including the second season! And the character you play wears different clothing and you can have three digimon! And you don't have to wait to digivolve, you can when you want to! But you shouldn't digivolve them just yet, they need more training! And you can armor Digivolve! Even use other armors! More example, say you use the Digi-egg of Courage of gatomon, she'd become Lynxmon! PLUS! You can get terriermon, and all his forms and golden armor digivolve him! And get, and Digivolve all the Digidestined around the world's Digimon! I REALLY guarantee it! ^_^"
3,Alright but not the best game,Ok trully if you are a hardcore Digimon fan Add a star to thatbut if you just like digimon keep that score. it fun to a point but gets boring after alittle while if you still want a digimon game get 3 instead!
5,Digimon World 2 Has More Digimon,I'm 9 years old.Digimon2 lets you have more than 1 digimon instaed of just 1.It is a lot better than Digimon one.
4,"A Good Game, but lacks in story.","Digimon World 2 is a good game for fans of games like Monster Rancher and Pokemon and of course fans of the Digimon Television show, but the story is lacking, well a story. You continue to go to different domains and battle different Digimon bosses, over and over and over. There isn't much thickness to the story at all. Over all it is a good game! Here is a break down in rating:Lowest: 1.0 Highest: 9.5Graphics: 9.0 Sound: 8.0 Control: 8.5 Story: 4.5 Overall: 8.5The game is neat, the Digimon are cool, the Graphics are excellent, the story sucks but overall it is ok."
5,digimon rocks,I THINK THAT DIGIMON WORLD2 IS A GREAT GAME AND EVREYBODY SHOULD TRY IT IT HAS SOMETHING EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY WILL ENJOY.IF YOU DONT LIKE IT I DONT KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD YOU MIGHT LIKE.
1,Digimon world 2,this game compared to digimon 1 or 3 is down right a mess. All I can say is I wish I had the money that I spent on this game.
1,BOOOOOOO,"I like digimon just a little..but this game [is bad].Way to pokemon!You capture digimon,travel around and once they had this thing that said""I am the greatest digimon master!""It stinks.Also i hate season 2!(except for blackwargreymon and DNA digivolving)"
3,to frusterating,i dont like this game becaus you get a game over in one try .i stoped playing this game on the 2nd boss.so dont get this game im sure you will regret it if you do.
4,Stevie Ray Vaughn plays on this,"This is the first Teena Marie Album I ever heard, so to me it was'nt weird at all. I really like this. If you like the music of that time, like Prince, The Tyme, Vanity. You will love this. This was a solid release, her talents shine brighter than the releases of the more popular artists mentioned. I don't know why this was not as successful. Stevie Ray Plays on a couple of the songs here."
4,The Tale of Two Cites- Not your ordinary Teena Marie,"Teena Marie is my all time favorite artist. Emerald City was her most ambitious album. It is even number 5 in the heavy metal hall of fame. Teena Marie heavy metal. Teena has an excellent cast of music characters. She moves from pop to jazz to ""out and out"" rock and roll. Shangri La is the star song on the album with her a drum machine and computer. Lips 2 Find U hits with whimiscals lines like ""to live within the major and the minor chords and forget how we made love in a 67 Ford"". Only Lady Tee could sing those lyrics."
4,"It May Not Be the Yellow Brick Road BUT it's still Teena""","I cannot give any of Teena's work a bad review. If only for ""Sunny Skies"", the album was worth the price of my admission. But I had to shift my head for the rockin' ""Lips to Find You"" or ""Once is Not Enough"". Sure, it was an unexpected detour. But if you are a fan of somebody.....you allow them room to grow, experiment and/or step out of the box. As an added treat, the long version of the gorgeous, heart wrenching ""Sunny Skies"" surfaced as a bonus track.......further making my personal case for letting Teena be Teena."
3,Too uneven,"Teena is all over the place on this one. Not her best, but there are a few gems to be found. After all this is Teena"
3,More than meets the eyes,"I definitely did not receive the case as pictured. The quality and retail packaging is great, but it's way too bulky and my Blackjack sits loose. Also, I can tell the plastic clip is very small and will probably not last long. Furthermore, if you think the front of the case that wraps around the phone is big, the back of the case is even bigger and it makes it very bulky when worn on a belt. It's definitely a universal-fit case and should not be advertised as a Blackjack case. I only gave it 3 for the quality.However, shipping was fast and they sent an antennae booster for free, but I haven't installed it yet. I just wish they'd sell the product as specified/pictured and be upfront about the fitment. Good price, but at $5 for shipping, it would be a total loss for me to return it.I found one locally at a generic cell stand at the mall for $15 that fit perfect."
2,belt clip not as shown!,"I have a Samsung Blackjack cell phone & was looking for a well-made case. I too, bought this case because of the specific belt clip shown in the picture above but was so disappointed when it came with the same weak, & cheap belt clip every other case had. False advertising! I lost my phone once already because this one doesn't grip tight enough and fell off. Thank god I noticed shortly after and was able to retrace my steps to find it.I'm giving it 2 stars b/c although the case itself is well-made and beautiful, this doesn't really matter if it falls off and gets lost. Also I should mention that in the picture where the case is open- you don't see anything on the inside of the flap or on the case under the flap, but the actual product has 4 big, silver, magnetic snaps. Not that big a deal, but the picture leads you believe the magnetic closures are hidden."
1,Malo,"El estuche es muy grande para el celular y muy rustico, si bien protege el celular ante caídas, así mismo es muy difícil de manejar. Ademas de que por lo general uno lo utiliza del lado derecho de la cintura y los estuches tienen una abertura debajo para poder empujar el celular hacia arriba y poder sacarlo, pero este estuche tiene la abertura del otro extremo por lo que es difícil sacar el celular a tiempo cuando una llamada entra ya que prácticamente hay que meter la mano en el estuche para sacarlo o utilizar las dos manos. No sirve es muy incomodo, voy a compra otro."
2,Too much banter!!,It was not an easy task to keep up with all the banter between the two and still wonder why they were drawn to each other. I normally enjoy this author but this one....well... was not one of her better books. Would I re-read this one NO. I may even delete this book as not to take up my storage space.
2,Ouch!,"I have a MB10, which is the same design with batteries and no charger. The little detail trimmer often catches in my beard, causing great pain. There are apparently no replaceable parts, so the environmentally responsible and cheapskates like me have to toss the thing when the blades dull. ""Self-sharpening blades?"" I don't think so! Time to try something new.The only good thing about this trimmer is the adjustable guard size. That was better than the Wahl, which required me to change clip-on guards."
1,Very Unhappy,"When I originally purchased the trimmer, I thought the charger came with it. It did not!! Trying to find a charger for the MB 40 has been a bigger pain than a swift kick in the butt.I am trashing this thing, and finding something more worthwhile."
1,Does not work for samsung blackjack i607,I order this to listen to music on my samsung blackjack SGH-i607 but it does not work. The phone does not recognize the headphone and sound does not get transferred to it instead keeps playing through the speaker on the back of the phone.
1,Rip off card,Be careful while purchasing this card. I did a quick purchase in amazon and 4.5$ was added on this 7.5$ worth item as shipping and handling charges even though the pin is sent through email!!!I wonder if you need stamps to send emails nowadays!!
2,NOISY!!,"With only two settings, I find that ""low"" does not produce enough mist for my very dry house, and the ""high"" setting is too noisy, even for my 2-year old. I prefer my V5100N."
2,Who has time for this?,"So far, this product has not put white dust everywhere, which is a good feature. My unit is quiet enough to sleep with it on. However, as other people have said, there's a hole in the bottom of the unit. That might not be so bad except that the unit has to be carried to the bathroom every day for cleaning, if one follows the instructions. It leaks as one carries it if one doesn't hold it absolutely level. I had planned to use it in my office during the day, but the leaking problem means I need to get a separate humidifier for my office.Also, if one were to follow the cleaning instructions provided, taking care of this unit would take a couple of hours a week."
2,Filter needs to be changed too often,"I have had this unit for about a week and I already need to change the filter. Also, the low setting is just like not having it turned on at all...I wake up with a headache and dry throat like usual. But it's too noisy to sleep with it on the high setting. After re-reading the reviews posted, I'm not even sure why I bought this unit in the first place."
2,Loud knocking noise,"I wouldn't recommend this product because within the first 3 months of having it, it started making a knocking noise with the fan. I haven't been able to subdue it since. I've tried pushing down on the mechanical unit and nothing."
1,Number 3 broke,"This humidifier is not my favorite. I have gone through 3. They don't last long, are loud and difficult to clean. I have switched to the one with no filter which is much better. I also like to see the mist coming out knowing for sure it is working. The filter on this one will dry out and or mold up. I do clean it regularly. I say spend an extra $15 for a better one."
4,EXACTLY what I wanted,This humidifier is for my room with the wood stove which is always the driest in the house in the winter. I like the fact the mist doesn't show and that the motor is very quiet. During the xmas tree time I had it turned towards the tree and know it helped keep it from drying out prematurely. And I no longer get a static shock when I try to touch the doorknob!
2,Did not last,I bought this unit for my Mom's bedroom. It did provide the cool mist she needed. Unfortunately it did not last. I bought it in the summer and it has burned out today.
1,Much better products out there,"Problems with this humidifier - the filters suck. They don't last long and are around $10 each and I go through maybe 2 or 3 each winter. If all the water isn't used at night and sits in the tray during the day, it starts to disintegrate the filter. Also, the new filters have a chemical odor the first few days you use it. The humidifier sounds like a fan, which is fine for me, but if you want a noiseless machine, this isn't it. It worked OK as a humidifier.Finally it broke one night and started violently shooting out water through the vent. I would never buy one of these again."
3,Great until it sprung a leak!,"Had bought one of these a couple of years ago for at home and still love it. Then bought another one for the office at work a little over a year ago, and it sprung a leak this morning and made a heckuva mess! So that was about $35 tossed in the trash. Not sure now if I'd order another one of these. Probably will try a different brand to replace the one I threw away. And worried now that the one at home is going to leak all over everything too!"
1,Three of these leaked in a row,"I've never written a review before, and I've been buying almost exclusively from Amazon.com for years, but I had to warn others that this product may be the worst I've ever seen. Today I had the third one of these in a row leak water all over my child's carpeting, even though the unit was brand new and I made super sure that I secured the water tank properly. Argh -- please don't buy this or the odds are very good you'll regret it and waste a lot of time and trips to UPS."
1,"""1 Gallon"" is the only true part of the title","I purchased one of these in a pinch, hoping to sooth the winter dryness that has been driving me nuts. Followed the instructions to set it up (which I'll be honest, is rare for me, but I wanted to be sure I was doing it right) and get it running. The air coming out seemed to be just that, air, with no extra moister. I left it on high all night, which was noisy as all get out, and the water level barely moved while the room was still desert dry. There is no mist. There is no humidity. There is no longer a Vick's humidifier in my room. I'll be looking at a Crane humidifier with better reviews and I recommend against this one, even though it's cheap, pay the $10 more and get something that 1,200 people all say worked well for them."
2,Pain to clean,"While the machine can be helpful in increasing/ maintaining humidity levels, I have found it to be a hassle. It needs to be cleaned regularly because of the risk that standing water can be a source of bacteria/ mold/ problems. This technology should be a commodity - and there are plenty of cool mist humidifier options. So if you are looking for one, I would recommend getting one that is designed to be very easy to clean."
2,"works fine, but mold build-up in warm homes","I liked the idea of invisible mist, and the humidifier worked just fine. However, since I live in an apartment building where I have no control over the heating of my apartment, and my apartment is quite warm, I found that with 7-10 days of use I would get mold build-up on the wicking filter. I could see the mold on the filter, and smelled mold when I operated the humidifier. After going through about three filters in the course of a month, and since those filters are quite expensive (about $8 each), I decided to just get a regular ultrasonic humidifier."
1,Was it supposed to be a humidifier?,"I am greatly disappointed. I purchased this humidifier a few months ago, and back I am shopping for another one as this one is going into the yard sale pile. It can run for hours and hardly impact the humidity level in a bedroom, with the door closed. I can't run it at night because it is so LOUD. Also, I have probably purchased three or four filters for it already."
2,Functions well but loud!,"The motor runs too loud to put in living room or bedroom. I have another one from this company - Penguin version. Penguin motor is quiet though water-dripping sound is constant, which I found it much more pleasant."
3,"Loud, but it works","We got this as a gift for our first baby. Well we both got stuffy noses about a week before he was due, so we broke it out of the box. It is loud. But on the low setting we can still sleep despite it. I think it is louder than a fan. So loud it makes us wonder if it is defective or not. But it seems like a common problem. The high setting is super loud, but we can tolerate it while awake with the TV turned up."
2,"Cute Design, Good Price, but LOUD Noise","I just bought this one yesterday at a local Target store for $29.99. I love its design and the price. Tried one night however not impressed at all. When I turned it on to high, I couldn't believe what I heard - it was so loud, sounded like pot boiling or hair dryer running. After it ran overnight for about 8 hours on low (it was quiet), only less than 1/4 of the water in the tank was gone. I guess not much mist generated. I don't know what to do yet with this one. Will certainly buy a different one."
3,I had the Vicks 1.2 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier for several weeks now.,"The Humidifier works OK, considering its low price. It looks nice and is easy to fill, however, you can't move it once it is filled, because ithas a hole for ""excessive"" water and will leak when moved. Also, the filter has to be constantly rinsed and needs to be replaced after a few weeks. When I set it on high, it is very noisy, so I turn it on high 2 hours before I retire and then on low.I no longer wake up with a dry throat, so it does what it's supposed to do."
1,Terrible - don't buy,"Yes, it's inexpensive - but it's a complete waste of money because it hardly gives any humidity, is really loud (impossible for a bedroom), and is very cheaply built. Cannot recommend it at all, wish I hadn't bought it."
1,Beware of leaks!,"Well it is quiet, easy to fill and whatnot, but this thing seemed to humidify my room by soaking the carpet. I never moved the unit, followed the directions and it all seemed to be functioning normally... I refilled it once a day for a couple days and noticed that wet spots were popping up nearby the unit and later realised that it was constanty leaking water through the drain plug. So I put it in a plastic tub to catch the water and saw that about 2/3 of the water I had put in the tank was just running back out of the unit and down into the carpet padding. My guess is the plunger on the drain cap was defective, but regardless it is a huge and messy disappointment! After throwing it away, (I lost the receipt), and cleaning the carpet extensively I would reccomend getting a different humidifier."
2,"Works fine, but went bad after 3 years","We used this humidifier for about three years during Winter months on a nightly basis. It worked well, although the high setting was too loud, so we were never able to get full use out of it. This year when we took it out, it no longer works. I find any machine that is built to only work for three years is not worth the money. Probably better to spend a bit more and get a reliable and quieter machine."
2,Very difficult to fill the water tank,It's not a terrible product but it is very difficult to remove the cap from the water tank and just as difficult to refill. Someone with arthritis would have a very difficult time maintaining this humidifier.
4,It's okay if you dont move it around...!,"I have been using it for about a week now and these are my first impressions:- Quiet on the low setting/on high it's loud, it's got a motor, it's got a fan, it's going to be loud - but low works!- Inexpensive- Do not try moving the entire unit around it will leak! Product Development please note: If you can figure out a way to enclose the lower tray you can avoid this.We have it by the bedside table and with two toddlers I need to get this this thing out of their way every morning. I am getting great practice for a circus balancing act. Trick is to move the upper (water container) unit first. Next, the lower tray ( which fills almost to the brim) - again, fine balancing skills required. And then the base.Overall, I will keep it. I did some research and it looks like all humidifiers have some or other glitch. I guess its the nature of the product itself. This one does the job, its inexpensive so I'm okay with it..."
1,Do Not Buy,"I read all the reviews before I bought this from Target and took them all into consideration hoping that I could prevent the problems listed. I cleaned weekly to prevent mold, I put a towel underneath to prevent water leakage, etc...It worked well for one month then I refilled it one morning and when I went to check it an hour later all the water was on the floor and it smelled strongly like something was burning. I cleaned it up and refilled it, then it was making a horribly loud noise. I emailed the company per it's instructions and after emailing them three times they have not replied.It's trash. Spend more money and get a quality humidifier. I recommend Air Swiss which is considerably more expensive but I have owned for over 7 years and still works great."
2,humidifier,This product is very loud so if you want to sleep with it on forget it. It does the job if you can handle the noise
2,It's great for first several weeks but...,When I just got the product I thought I made a great choice. Then I started noticing bad smells from the filter. I washed the filter every day but the smell just got worse and worse.. The filters are not cheap and it only last only for a month (the filter starts smelling bad after 1 month of use). This humidifier turns out to be a very expensive buy!
3,It's OK,"Pain to clean, why can' they make a humidifier that doesn't need to be cleaned daily? With all the other baby tasks, it's hard to remember to do this. I like their warm mist version better but the cool one is safer for the baby's room."
5,Works Great.,"This machine is very quiet even on high setting. On low setting, I had to put my hand in front of it to make sure it was on, it's practically silent. It's perfect for a bedroom or similar sized room. I use distilled water in it. The filters are easy to find and easy to replace. This machine makes sleeping far more comfortable."
4,not bad for the price,"ive had this humidifier for about a month. it's pretty good for a smaller room, but it is rather loud when put on high."
4,very good humidifier,this was a baby gift for a friend- they had said that this was one of the better humidifiers.
5,Very quiet and effective,"I've only been using this product for a few days, but already I've noticed a tremendous improvement in my sinuses. I got the humidifer because my husband and I were getting nose bleeds and the air in our house is just very dry. The unit is easy to assemble and clean, and the noise output is extremely low--even on the highest setting. I am on the lookout for mold in the filter but have yet to spot any.I would definitely recommend this product. You can't beat the effectiveness for the low price!"
2,not dependable,It just didn't last. Got a couple of years out of it but felt that for a brand name it should not have leaked.It became a throw away.
2,Cleaner Air,"This product helps you breath cleaner, fresher, cooler air, and serves its purpose for the first time. But, it you're not careful about cleaning the resovior and changing the filter as needed it could bring you some foul odor. If you have respiratory problems this product could be right for you? It makes a calm mild sound nothing loud and annoying."
1,Leaks Everywhere,"I bought this as a hot deal referenced from one of my favorite sites. I saw the 4 stars and thought I'd give it a try. I read the bad reviews and as whenever you see so many reviews with an outcome of 4 out of 5 you dismiss them as crazy. Well this things has leaked ever since we bought it. The design is shockingly flawed. I think a 8 your old could see this thing point out its flaws. It you touch it, fill it, move it, do anything with this humidifier water will come out the sides and everywhere it can. Today I needed to move it and it leaked from the screw holes in the bottom. This thing was treated with care, I read the instruction a few times (due to disbelief that anyone would put such a thing on the market) and still it just leaks everywhere. Do not buy this humidifier, you will regret it."
4,Recommended,This unit works well... very quiet and the tank lasts a full 24 hours on low setting. Only drawback is having to lift tank off of unit to fill by turning tank over to unscrew cap. Filler port should be on top to make it easy to fill for those who may have difficulty lifting and maneuvering a full tank back into place. A top fill would yield a five-start rating.
5,Very happy with this model,"I have owned this model for about 3 years but just recently started to use it most of the time. All of the claims that it can leak are true- it happened to me the first time i used it. But it was my fault for not reading the directions carefully. Since i got used to it, I've learned NOT to try to move the unit once it's filled with water. I'm pretty sure it's a safety feature, and it makes sense. And yes, the high setting makes noise - but we're not talking like a 747 jet here, people. I like the noise since my two youngest kids share a room. It creates a nice white noise that allows them both to sleep without disturbing eachother throughout the night. Great for light sleepers!! And I have to say that their colds are not as severe or as long in duration this year than they have been in years past. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but maybe not. I do clean it once a week and change the filter every three weeks or so. Not a problem. And I swear it helps with dry skin as well."
1,Noisy,"If you are using this in a bedroom, you might want to buy earplugs as well. On the high setting, this is as noisy as a medium sized fan on high."
2,uses water but only raises humidity slightly,"I wanted something for my dry eyes. So, I got one of these.I couldn't feel much difference so I bought a thermometer with a humidity gauge. My house was only 30% humidity, pretty dry, and in a smallish bedroom with the unit on high it only raised the humidity to 33%. If I put the gauge right by the blower of the unit, it will read cooler and about 50% humidity, so I know it's putting out something and my guage seems to work, but my room, which is 10ft x 12 ft x 8 ft(ceiling) is not getting very humid at all."
1,Newer model is unsafe--leaked horribly,Do not buy another one of these if you have an old one that works! We bought one of these humidifiers in 2009 and it has worked fine. We recently bought another to have in a seperate room and the first night it leaked. A true leak (not just water build up or condensation) out of the opening where the cord comes out of the plastic case. Water was all over the table and running down the back on to the carpet.A warning to all of the skeptics out there: I read the complaints but I should have taken them seriously.
3,merely ok,"The humidifier is a good value and works fairly well. It's fairly easy to clean and does a good job at keeping the humidity level up in my condo during the winter months. It's fairly noisy, though, and I've had trouble with the motor making grinding noises on the lowest setting."
1,Stay Away: Faulty Tank Cap,"Like others have mentioned there's an issue with the cap for the water tank (boy, do wish I had read those reviews). After leaking two gallons of water onto my sick son's bedroom floor (so much for that nap), I called customer service to see what I was doing wrong. Apparently nothing. The young woman on the phone told me that I must have gotten one of the ""older"" v3100's and that the ""newer"" ones had resolved this problem. Really? I bought mine off the shelf this morning at Target. So, was there a way to tell the difference between a ""new"" v3100 and an ""old"" one? Did they have different packaging? Different model numbers? No and no, she said. The old ones are just mixed in. Ingenious, I told her! Customers always like a good surprise.Now excuse me while my son and I go sit in the steamed-up bathroom."
2,Hit or Miss! Buyer Beware!,"We bought our first one of these 2 years ago and it worked great! We expected to have to replace it after a winter or two since it is pretty cheap, so we went to buy a new one 2 weeks ago. The motor sounded like it was going to burn out at any moment from the moment we got home and plugged it in. So, we return it and since I had replacement filters from our first one, decided to try for a third! This one leaks everywhere! So, back to the store we go today! So far the odds of getting one that is not defective is 33%. Not that great! I think I'll just have to suck it up and pay extra for one that will actually work well. Disappointed to have all of these filters, though!"
1,Expected alot more from this item!,"I bought this item for my infant daughter's room for the winter and it worked well the first two nights on high. On the third night, I woke to water dripping off the dresser - it was leaking out the back. The next night I put a towel under it and only turned on low. It was okay for another few nights but then started leaking on low as well.I followed the directions exactly as written. I just threw this item away (as I no longer had the receipt or box to return to the store).I would not recommend this to anyone if you don't want your furniture ruined and don't want to clean up water in the middle of the night."
1,Waste of money,"It's supposed to humidify the air. It doesn't. We have this in a 12x12 bedroom and, even with the door closed, it does not humidify the air. Both my husband and I would wake with dry mouths and noses. If you need a noise machine, this is for you. If you need a humidifier, buy another brand or model."
3,Vicks 1 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier....just okay,"Works just okay. It has two settings...low and high. High is very, very noisy. Low is very, very quiet. In a 12 X 14 room the low does not provide as much humidity as we would like. The high setting is just too noisy to use...at least for a bedroom. One good point, however, is that it produces a cool mist that does not create a damp spot anywhere. The mist dispurses immediately into the air. Given all the choices on the market, and I looked at many of them, I still believe it would have been my choice."
4,Effective!,"This Vicks humidifier really does what it is intended for, and more - it even cools the room (I have a small room, however). Ever since I used this, my nose have not dried and have slept well. I have only one problem with it, it is a bit noisier than my previous humidifiers, hence the 4 stars, instead of 5."
2,leaking,I'm looking for another vaporizer now. First it leaked onto my hardwood floors. then we put towels under ours and were careful to not block it but the towel would be soaked the next morning. Cant figure out where this leaks but it does. The paper filter gets gross pretty quickly so I went to buy a new one and found this essentially piece of paper with holes in it is $15 or so at local shops. Then the replacements quickly start getting moldy and gross too. The thing sounds ok and emits vapor ok but I dont know if the leaks are due to bad design causing my wife to easily spill it repeatedly or bad quality simply leaking out slowly. But its causing issues in my house that I dont need. Seriously at this price it should just work. its a piece of plastic with a simple motor....do some testing people or quality check your products.
2,Expensive to Maintain,"I purchased this humidifier one year ago for $40 at Target, and I have spent almost $100 in replacement filters. You have to replace the filter at least once a month, and they aren't cheap. I could have just bought a machine without a filter, and probably spent the same amount of money as I have in replacement filters!I will give this machine credit, though; it is quiet and we use it at least 12-15 hours per day while my daughter sleeps. It doesn't need to be refilled as often as most, and it's compact so it fits nicely in small places."
3,wick dies too quickly,very good when it works... but the wick doesn't last too long.. for me.. it died in less than a month.. and I had to buy new ones...
3,I like it!,"At first I thought it was broken, but it can be really hard to tell that it's on when it's on the low setting. You'll feel the mist lightly though. The high setting can be a little noisy, but you can expect that from most humidifiers. You get used to it.Easy to store and easy to clean. Really no-fuss and gets the job done.I'm a big complainer and I have no complaints about this."
1,Leaks!,"Some others have written this before- listen to their warning...There is a hole in the bottom of the humidifier under the water tray that will leak water. Mine leaked during the second use. So i'm not sure why it didn't do it the first time. But either way, big disappointment and huge mess to clean up!"
2,Great if you like airplane noise,"This cool mist humidifier works fairly well at its stated job. However it is extremely noisy and too loud to run at night in a bedroom even at the lower speed. It's so loud we can hear it through the hardwood floor to our family room below. I recently purchased a Crane humidifier for my son's room and it's extremely quiet. Even though it's an animal shape, I'll try that one for my room rather than this one."
1,Broke in 2 weeks,"This humidifier broke within a couple of weeks. It makes a clicking sound I can't make go away, and it goes through water very quickly. I found out today that it goes through water so quickly because it was leaking on my dresser and has now ruined it.I bought a Crane humidifier for my son, and that works great--quiet, no leaks, etc. This one is terrible, and I have to suck up the $30 I paid. It's going in the trash now."
5,Great for a bedroom,"I live in a high rise building with very dry air. I really like the High-Low fan options on this unit: I leave it on High during the day, allowing my bedroom to become properly moist, and turn it to Low at night. The High setting is a bit too loud for sleep if the unit is close to the bed, but the Low setting is barely audible and still gives good humidity. The filter is easy (and inexpensive) to replace. In terms of the other reviews that have said there are leaking problems, this will be the case if you pick up the base unit and do not keep it level. (One look at the water tray on the inside will show you.) Keep the unit level and it will not leak. Love this product overall!"
1,Obnoxious piece of junk,"The fan on this thing is LOUD! And only slightly better if you put it on low, but that sort of defeats the purpose. And the fan blows COLD air straight out the front! It's like having an air conditioner on. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."
1,Keep looking for a better option,"Just bought this and it's going back. The ""high"" mode sounds like a motor boat. We have other humidifiers and can't believe how loud this one is in comparison. Also, the way you fill the water tank is prone to spills and leaks. They took a simple idea and made it needlessly complex, with extra seals, valves, and balance. Not sure why it's so hard to make a good humidifier, wish Vicks/Kaz would have just stuck to the basics."
1,Soaked the floor,"I purchased this humidifier to combat the dry air in the bedroom. I read all the directions, filled it up and turned it on. The water gushed out of the bottom and soaked the carpet. Don't buy this!"
4,Quiet and sufficent but it is cool mist,"This cool mist is one of the best. I knew because I owned several different brands. This one served the purpose and it is quiet. I did not give it a five stars because I am still shopping for a warm mist and quiet one. If I cannot find another warm mist and it's quiet, I will buy another one of this cool mist to replace my current warm mist."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is by far the worst humidifier I have ever owned. It worked fine for a week but when I turn it on it will run fine at 1st then starts leaking like crazy. I woke up to a lake on and under my nightstand tonight. It's a hazard. DO NOT BUY THIS HUMIDIFIER!!!!!!!!
1,Just fell apart,"My daughter bought one of these several weeks ago. Worked fine for a while then it just died. She brought it home this weekend to see if I could figure out the problem. Well, I did.Two of the internal screws that hold the blower motor in place came loose and fell out inside of the humidifier. One of them became jammed in the blower wheel, the motor probably overheated and blew it's thermal link. Not repairable short of replacing the motor which would certainly cost more than simply replacing the unit with a different brand...... which is what I did.My opinion, this thing is cheap Chinese junk."
1,Vicks Humidifier,I am sorry to say this has to be the worst humidifier we have had. I cannot even open the cap for water without feeling like I am going to break my hand and I have good strength. Only had it four months and it is leaking out the bottom. The filters are so expensive. I would not recommend this to anyone and I see that I am not the only person. We have to throw it away.
1,Sounds like a diesel truck!,I returned this a couple days after buying it. I kept thinking maybe I could get use to the awful noise but I couldn't. Its SO LOUD!
1,Not as advertised...,"I am not sure if my unit is defective, but I was not getting a good result with the two speeds available, low and high. The low speed barely uses any water and the high speed is super loud. I ended up taking this item back and getting the Crane 2.3 Gallon COOL Mist humidifier. The Crane is very quiet and works great."
2,Not enough humidity,"As other reviews mention, the rate at which the tank empties is too slow. It took more than 18 hours in high setting to empty the tank. It seems like the water is not even getting through the tank's valve. When you shake or move the unit, you can see bubbles coming out the valve and water flowing to the filter, filling space that was supposed to be filled with water."
2,Wish I could open it,"I bought two of these humidifiers for my children's rooms because the one I like best (also from Vick's) is not made any longer. They don't leak, they work well, and they make a great white noise to help mask other sounds. Like another reviewer, however, we have a terrible time trying to open the water tanks. I'm afraid I'm going to dislocate my thumb someday trying to get those things open. I would return them for this reason if I could."
3,Don't buy this if you suffer from extremely dry skin or excema,"This humidifier does a fairly good job of preventing dry throat but it does a poor job of preventing dry skin or in preventing excema from a very dry and warm room. It's very quiet on the low fan setting, I can't hear it when I'm sleeping, but it is very loud on the high setting. You can only use the high setting when you're not in the room. Overall it's a fairly good product considering the price. I love the fact that it comes with a 5 year warranty. However, I will be purchasing a more expensive model that emits a warm mist, probably air-o-swiss. I needed and still need a humidifier that will prevent dry skin and excema. Well I got what I paid for."
4,"Works great, little loud","I'm really bad about remember to clean out my humidifiers, and therefore I'm replacing them a lot. I used to buy real nice ones, but that got expensive, so I decided to try this one this time, because it was quite a bit cheaper than the others I was looking at. I really like the fact that it completely drains... my other humidifiers shut off at a certain level, leaving water sitting in the base for however long we went between remembering to fill it. This one completely drains, so I think it will stay cleaner and more sanitary for much longer. I've experienced no leaking with int, and it's simple to use. My only reason for knocking a star off, is that it's quite a bit louder than all the other humidifiers I've used. The high setting is loud enough that we never run it on that, unless we want to get the humidity up in the room before we go in... but once we're in the room, low is the only thing we can stand. Still, very happy with the purchase"
2,Mold issues...,"Yes, it helped moisturize the air - but after a few days, I noticed a moldy smell and, sure enough, the filter had mold on it. I cleaned it, let it dry between each use, but the same thing kept happening. I bought new filters with the same result. I am now shopping for a different humidifier... this one simply doesn't work with my mold allergy."
4,i fixed the leak!,"We had an earlier version of this which we liked but the new one leaked. I finally called the customer service # and they were very helpful. The cap for filling water needs to be replaced in locked, very tight, position, and it will not leak. It was very hard to open to empty but at least it's usable now."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Just bought it and I'm not impressed. On low the sound is okay. On high it's loud. Also it's an invisible mist, so you do not see it. It basically feels like you have the a.c. on. Looks like I'll be looking into another brand that fits out needs better."
2,Spend a few bucks for a nicer humidifier,"After using the unit for a couple of months, the fan sounds like it is about to break and the amount of moisture it releases has certainly declined. I've tried several times to contact the vendor but with no luck. The filter also needs to be replaced fairly often, even when using the protec cleaning supplies (my house is clean and uses HEPA filters due to severe allergies). I recommend spending the extra $5-$10 to buy a nicer humidifier."
2,High Maintenance,"I bought this as a stop-gap measure between pricier humidifiers. That gap was about 1 month.The pro: it worked for a month.The cons: the instructions say you have to empty and clean the unit DAILY. This is a very high maintenance unit. If you've got plenty of free time, it might be worth your while.After our last round of cleaning (not daily; more like weekly) we reassembled the machine and turned it on. It ran until we turned it off to check that the reservoir cap was on tightly. After reassembling it , the unit stopped working. We've tried re-seating the reservoir, dumping out all of the water and unplugging/plugging the unit into the outlet. Nothing. Boo, Vicks."
2,Works great for a few weeks,"This humidifier sucks. Don't waste your money. It works fine for a few weeks at most and then you have to buy a replacement filter. With the amount of money I've spent having to replace the filter, I could have gotten a better quality humidifier."
2,meh,This is cheap and I think it's only somewhat effective. It's also incredibly noisy (can't hear my radio alarm over it) and gets a musty smell very quickly.
2,filter is annoying,That filter gets dirty in like a week. You'll spend more on replacements than the humidifier itself.
1,this humidifier is terrible!,"It doesnt let out any mist, and the water level stays the same. This humidifier is a waste of money. I will never buy another Vick's product again."
1,Humidifier of poor quality,"I purchased Vicks 3100 humidifier for my daughter's room a month ago. Today, I noticed the carpet in her room is all wet. The humidifer leaks from the bottom of the unit. I will not recommend this to anyone."
2,Noisy and leaks,"The only way to keep it working during the night is if you are deaf or wearing ear plugs.It is also prone to leaking water on whatever furniture you put it on. Unfortunately I cannot rate its effectiveness, as I never started to use the machine for the above reasons."
2,not that great,"I just bought this humidifier a month ago. I read a ton of reviews and they were such a mixed bag of good and bad, but this one seemed to rate higher than most and it wasn't too expensive. Quite honestly, I didn't have high expectations b/c my experience with humidifiers hasn't ever been good, and this one is true to form - mediocre. There are only two ""speeds"" - high and low. The high speed is very noisy so I have to keep it on low all the time. I still wake up in the morning with dryness, so I'm not sure how effective it really is at humidifying the air. On the plus side, the tank is easy to carry around and refill."
1,Not happy at all,I bought this and plugged it in and NO vapor came out at all. Then I read further and thought it may be an evaporative humidifier (although it didn't say so on the box or anywhere else but the pamphlet). But apprently that means there is no mist that you can see visibly but the water goes through the filter and emits moist air and the only way you know it is working is when the water level goes down and the room feels moister. Well I had it on all day and the water level went down like an 18th of an inch if that and the noise on the lowest setting was so loud we had to shut it off at night when we needed it most. Didn't notice any difference in the moisture level in my kids room even after running all day. MAybe mine was defective but I won't try it again.
1,different than expected,"I am also accustomed to the old fashioned humidifiers that blow out mist and accumulate white dust on everything in the house. I bought this for my daughter because it said it was quiet, that is a bold faced lie. I don't know how many times I've asked my daughters to turn off the bathroom fan, and they say Mom, that is the humidifier, and I'm downstairs. I have it on right now and it sounds like someone is using a blow dryer! I'll keep it because it was cheap and so what if we throw it away at the end of the season. Easier than returning it. And don't forget to clean it out, because if you leave it off for awhile and then turn it back on, it smells worse than wet dog! It was nasty."
1,This humidifier leaks everywhere!,"I used to have this model humidifier for years and for no particular reason stopped using it. When I came down with a respiratory virus this winter the doctor suggested I use a humidifier. I immediately purchased this one because I had such great success with it in the past. However, they must have changed the design because this model leaks everywhere! I woke up to the sound of a river in my bedroom and it soaked everything.I thought perhaps it was just a faulty model so I returned it and got another one...same problem! There must be some sort of a design flaw that if it's not seated properly, which I was very aware of this time, but I still woke up to this model leaking everywhere. It's really a shame because it's a great unit but the leaking is unacceptable in my book. I would not recommend this model."
1,Motor quit after 3 months,"I would not recommend this humidifier. Besides not liking the invisible mist, which is not the source of my 1 star, the motor gave out after using nightly for about 3 months."
4,Don't add eucalyptus to the water,"I purchased this humidifier 3 years ago and it's still working fine. It has never leaked. The replacement filters are easy to find. I use it in my son's bedroom. I use a humidity meter to make sure the RH% is optimal. This humidifier, set on low, does the trick in a small room.The reason I rated it 4 stars is because the tank's opening is too small (approx. 2"" diameter)to fit your hand inside for cleaning. I added eucalyptus to the water since I like the smell, but it caused a residue to build on the inside of the tank. The instructions warn against adding anything to the water, so it's my own fault. I just wish the inside of the tank were more accessible for cleaning. Soap and water shaken inside works fine under normal circumstances but it doesn't remove eucalyptus oil residue."
1,Don't waste your money on this item.,Don't waste your money on this product. I've had it less than one year and used it less than a dozen times. It's already broken. I'm going to look for a more suitable product that will hopefully last longer.
2,"""The Filter Racket""","This humidifier works ok. I found humidity level pretty low, but when left on constantly it was comparable to my last ""cheapie"" humidifier. Low setting is quiet, and well, low. High setting is pretty loud and still pretty low humidity.Before you purchase this look at your options for getting filters. Yeah, you really only have one. Expect to spend $7+ per filter that you will have to change approximately every month. This machine WILL NOT FUNCTION with no filter or an ""old"" (yes, about a month) filter!So expect to keep paying for this one over and over by way of filters. Wish I would have done more research into ""the filter racket"" before purchasing this type/model of humidifier..."
4,Durable and works for an entire room,"We've had this humidifier for 2 years and I use it in my kids' bedrooms when they are ill. I'd buy in again as it works really well and after dropping the easy to carry handle we were able to easily get a replacement tank from the company for a low price.Pros: (1) Does well with humidifying a large room, (2)large tank is easy to fill and (3)we can usually get 2 nights before draining the tank completely. Cons: (1) We must use it on a completely flat surface or it leaks and (2) the filter is large and fills up with water so it swells making changing out the tank messy if you're not careful."
3,Poor Output & Needs a medium speed,"I have had this model for us in the winter for 4 years now. I keep telling myself I'll get a better one (for our bedroom) but have been too lazy to find another. It desperately needs a middle speed setting. The low is simply too low to provide any measurable moisture and on high it is loud enough to wake the dead. But even on high, the output can't even keep my bedroom up to 35% when it is dry outside. It looks nice and is easy to refill, but just doesn't do the job."
2,ehhh...not so great,I've had this humidifier for a year now and I'm really not impressed. It needs to be cleaned constantly and goes through filters very quickly. They get really moldy and gross in no time. It is quiet on the low setting but that is about the only good thing I have to say about it. I am not looking around for a new humidifier.
1,Jet Noise,Title should say it all. This humidifier is too loud to use in a bedroom if anyone wishes to sleep.
1,Don't buy it,"This was by far the worst I have used.First of all, on the higher setting it is incredibly loud (I don't mind a little noise, but this was excessive). I ran it three nights in a row (on the high setting) and it still did not empty the tank. I even held my hand in front of the fan for a few minutes and there was no moisture on my hand. When I have gone to clean the machine, I have noticed that the cap can be very difficult to open. The tank is hard to clean because you can't get your hand in it. Once I even noticed that water had escaped the tray and was near where the electronic part of the machine was. I will be taking this back ASAP."
2,loud and not that humidifying,"It takes about two days to empty a tank on low, on high it sounds like a wind tunnel. Way too loud. The paltry amount of humidity put into the air hardly makes a difference in our bedroom.It says to change the filter when you start to notice discoloration, after a week it is already starting.The latch to fill the tank is really poorly designed, it is extremely difficult to open, and I'm a big guy.I bought this model because of the dishwasher cleaning, but after seeing the performance there is no way I'd buy it again or recommend it to others. Ultrasonic humidifiers put way more water into the air, and I really regret not getting one this time."
3,Varies from one to another,"I originally purchased this unit for my child's room 2 years ago -- worked fine. There was no soaked carpet, no leaks, no fires, and no problems finding filters. I even liked the level of sound - it would get loud gradually. My child (now 2 yrs old) loved the sound so much we had to find a sound machine to duplicate it.We purchased another unit for our second child's room. Strangely, this unit worked differently than the first. The second one leaked (very litte - nothing a hand towel under the unit couldn't fix) and was MUCH louder than the first. I also found that I needed to refill this unit more often than I did the first.I didn't see too much of a problem with the difference, just thought it was worth mentioning..."
4,TY Diago Beanie,"This is the perfect toy for a little boy who loves watching Diago. He carries it everywhere and at night takes it to bed with him. Worth every cent, just seeing his eyes light up and realizing that I am this little guys hero. I usually find just the right gift when I shop on Amazon."
5,Great role-playing toys,My daughter loves to role-play with these little stuff toys. She has them talking to each other and re-enacts certain scenes from the show.
3,cute but wrong color,"Like other reviews I read about this product, Diego came with the wrong type of clothing than what is pictured. I'm pretty sure my son will enjoy it for his Christmas present but wish it was true to the picture!"
4,Cute,It is really cute. I didn't even know who Diego was. I wish it were a little larger but will be great for the toddler I purchased it for.
3,Not as pictured,"I made a special effort to order this doll because he was pictured in the classic Diego outfit, blue shirt and white vest, but the one I received is wearing a red shirt. I am fairly disappointed. I am considering returning it, but it was intended for a travel toy and we leave in just a couple days. If considering this doll know that you might get the one that is pictured in the set of four with Dora, Diego, Boots and Baby Jaguar. The set is a great deal."
4,Go Diego Go!,"My 3.5 year old son loves Dora and Diego! I thought for christmas I would get him his favorite characters because he has been asking for them. I got Dora, Diego, Boots, Swiper and baby Jaguar. They are all super cute and TY makes good stuffed toys, I just wish that Dora and Diego were a little bigger. BUT my son will love them and be able to take them all along with him in his rescue pack ;)"
3,Bought as part of a Halloween costume,"This toy, and a Boots TY Beanie Baby, were bought to go with the Dora Backpack as part of a Halloween costume for a 2-year-old. She liked them, although I don't believe the dolls are meant for under 3, as they have parts that could be pulled off."
1,Not as described,"I purchased this because it was described as being a denim apron--it was a blue twill material which has not washed well and is prone to fading. I kept it as i did not want to hasle with an exchange, etc. but wish I had especially after I had washed it. Disappointed since you expect descriptions to be accurate via amazon."
4,"Protection from spills, splashes and dust, beware the pointy things though","If you're expecting something as thick and protective as jeans denim, this will disappoint. It's a thinner material than that although I think it is in the same family (twilled cotton, basically). That's fine by me. It's substantial enough and I was counting on it being light enough to be sort of comfortable when the temperature here pushes up toward 100 F. I wanted to protect my street clothes from glue, finish and sawdust and it does that pretty well. This means I can pop out to the shop to do a few tasks without the inconvenience of changing into work clothes every time. This means I get more done."
1,Tie Ropes too small,The ones available in local stores have longer tie ropes that extend to your belly. Its easy for tying. The ones that I ordered from Amazon have short ropes and its hard to put your hands behind your body and fumble with the knot. Its particularly hard for elderly persons who have Arthiritis ot Tentenitis.
2,Usable in ways the author never expected,"Ok - I'm not a youth minister. I'm not even a Christian. But I am writing a book, and that book has a youth minister in it, and I bought this hoping to glean insights into how youth ministers interact on a practical day-to-day basis with 'their' kids. For this purpose it was sufficient, but just barely - I learned mainly that youth ministers are as much given to cheesy gimmickery and mistaken assumptions as Jr. High counselors and similar species.I give one star for the knowledge I actually gained, and one star for the possibility (though it appears to me unlikely) that the book might be better if used as directed."
3,"Not bad, but.......","This book, while interesting, just isn't up to the level of the books before it. The introduction of the meta plot by White Wolf, along with making the game that much darker, dampens my enthusiasm for this title. However, it does include some interesting ideas, and the exploration of the Order of Reason is a good addition. I do miss Phil Brucato's fine way with the game, though."
1,This did not work for me,"I bought this due to issues with a raccoon and squirrels getting into my attic, this light has not had any effect as far as I can tell."
1,Not effective,Has not detered grey squirrels from my attic. We installed and operate it as directed but there is no effective on the squirrel(s) in my attic.
1,Can't tell if it works,"Admittedly my attic is larger than the coverage stated for this product. However, I've caught squirrels in a hav-a-hart track sitting plainly within this product's reach. So I have to imagine folks looking to rid themselves of these biggers should try a trap first (and obviously plug up the entrances) before dropping what is a lot of money on this strobe light"
3,Very Effective in Small Spaces,"These units are very effective to rid attic spaces of squirrels. I had a big-time issues with them - after purchasing a couple of these, they were gone in a day.Be careful, the 10k unit only covers a small area. I had to buy a few more to get rid of the critters. I highly recommend the 100K unit as it covers wide open spaces in the attic, which I have in my home. The attic is a bit over 2,000 sq ft with many angles and raised ceiling areas. Ultimately, I had to get 3 of the 10K units and one of the 100K units to get the coverage that was needed. If you don't cover all spaces, the friendly little devils just hire a mover and relocate to the darkened spaces."
1,it work for few days,"it work for few days, after that this product does not work. if you already know the hold and use it to chase them out and cover the hold AS SOON AS they out, it may work, but it you use it for more than one week, it will not work at all. I don't know where all of the testimonials come from on this website and on the manufacturers site. I have had these in the attic for over a week with 4-5 squirrels."
1,Does not Work,"This product does not work. I don't know where all of the testimonials come from on this website and on the manufacturers site. I have had these in the attic for over a week with 4-5 squirrels. They almost seem to be mocking the strobe light. I had two lights in a 1000' attic and yesterday I went up to check out the situation. Sitting at the edge of the attic where the roof line meets was a medium sized flying squirrel, staring at me and the strobe light right next to me. I stood and watched him for about 5 minutes. He did not blink, move or run away. As I started to walk back to the staircase he jumped back down between the joists. I have heard them constantly the last 24 hours. If they ultimately work I will revise/update my review but this is a WARNING to avoid this product. As of now, 7.5 days and just as loud and active as ever."
2,Strange book but nicely up to date,"I enjoyed reading The Locals - but, I feel that it is not the real investigative book that it pitches itself as. It is well written; however, the investigation is lacking in much meat that would make the book and the investigator credible. For instance, the researcher goes off on some expeditions and finds some evidence which either startles him, he runs out of time or just gives up. The reader (and theorist) is left wondering -- why??? If you are on the tracks of collecting pictures and sounds or having a genuine contact, why would you leave the scene and just explain that you ran out of time or gave up? I dont think that is very good science or investigative research. Other than that, its a nice read. It was good fun to read as I traveled through the Skookum/St Helens area myself."
4,Bigfoot - so much more than an animal,"A very educational and entertaining book.Thom Powell offers a truly remarkable series of examples of the amazing intelligence, cunning, and skill of these Bigfoot individuals, casting serious doubts on the theory of a ""dumb ape"", and introducing through compelling stories of real interactions with Bigfoot individuals their amazing capabilities.Good ""need to know"" information for anyone wishing to improve their knowledge and advance the field of Sasquatch or Bigfoot research."
5,One of the Best on Bigfoot,"Thom Powell's ""The Locals"" is a unique examination of Bigfoot that stands apart from most other books on the subject.Powell examines and speculates on reported ""typical"" Bigfoot behavior and uses common sense in doing so.The fact that he is a teacher seemed to have greatly helped because his book caused me to think. It is not simply another collection of Bigfoot reports - But it seeks to examine and understand things about the Sasquatch that are often not thoroughly studied.It's very good and very worth the read if you are interested in this sunject. I think it is probably the best contemporary book of its' kind."
1,Powell lost me when...,"...he got to his theories on sasquatches possessing the ability to teleport, read minds, etc. More evidence (much, much more) than what is provided in this book is required before anybody should be going do those paths."
4,Soothing Yet Passionate,"I find the music of Sade to be very comforting. SThe blend between the vocals and the supporting instruments really tugs at my heart. Many yearning emotions are conjured up here. Sade, the lady indeed has a deep soul as you feel her pain and anguish in such touching numbers as War Of The Hearts and Mr. Wrong. Maureen is an interesting change of pace number as the beat definitely has some bop. You really can not go wrong with this CD or any by this lady and her band."
4,Best of the jazz/blues vocalists,"Of all the jazz/blues vocal artists to come out of the eighties (Simply Red, Swing Out Sister, etc.) Sade was the best. Her sultry vocals were cool and detached but had more soul and emotion.Her earlier albums, like this one, were her better efforts. To go along with her voice, she had the perfect accompaniment. The music is rich and textured and the playing is great. The only downside is that the electronic percussion on some of the songs make the music sound a little dated. It was an eighties thing, and there is good reason why electronic percussion didn't last.In later albums, such as Love Deluxe, the music is muted and bland. There is even more reliance on simple electronic percussion. But these are all minor complaints. Any one of the Sade albums makes for great mood or background music."
5,This CD Is Great!,"I just love Sade! I had this on tape form, but I was glad to find it on CD form! I really want to have everything that she has made. My favorite song on this CD is Maureen! I would like to really ask Sade if, Maureen was her friend and ask her what happen to her? Well any who I just love this CD!Thank You,Joy"
5,Paper Dolls,My husband and I looked for bedding for about 2 months and he actually saw this pattern and decided that our little needed it. We have been able to add many things to her room because of the many colors in the pattern. It is definitely the cutest thing we have seen out there to buy.
5,my baby girl deserves the absolute best!,"i was registered for this item and i'm sooo excited to have received it! i have the ENTIRE set and i'm sooo glad i chose this one. ever since i found out that i was having a girl, i knew that there would be a lot of pink involved. i love the color pink, but not too much of it. and this set worked out perfectly. the room was already painted pink. and so the colors of the set worked and blended in perfectly. and with that said, there's alot you can add as well. i think she would even be able to grow into it. and i think it goes best with a white crib! absolutely beautiful!"
1,it doesn't work,"I need this adapter to connect to my monitor which comes only with VGA interface. however, it doesn't work.sucks"
3,Decent,"I bought this for a six month deployment to SW Asia. It's worked well and been quite convenient. For the price it's a good shaver. It does chew up my face a little bit, but not too bad."
3,"Good shaver, not so good battery",I bought this shaver a little less than a year ago and I was impressed by the closeness of the shave it gave but I was a little surprised that it only ran off the battery. I expected to get a couple of years of use out of it but it is already starting to slow down. Pretty soon I will have to charge it every night just to get a slow shave. Not a bad shaver but spend a little more for a better battery or one that runs off battery or cord.
3,"Good razor, but poor battery life","I found this to be a good razor and that it gave a close shave. However, like others have posted, the battery has died very quickly. I now have to charge it every night and even then I barely get through shaving before it starts to run down. I will be getting another Remington razor, but I will be getting a non-cordless one."
2,Very short life,"Well the shaver itself was great. It gave me a clean shave and left my skin virtually uniritated.The main problem was that it died a year and half after I bought it! the battery would charge and work but the motor was working so slow that it was impossible to shave with.So since the 1 year warranty is over, and I had no box or reciept I had to throw the damn thing out :(So overall its a great shaver for your money but it may die..."
2,NOT a Norelco,"Well, I must agree with those who said that this shaver is mediocre. I bought the refurbished one at $20 and it is worth that, but not a penny more. It does not give a close shave without going over your face several times. My Norelco worked this well when the blades were 8 years old!I admit, I usually had to shave twice with the Norelco, but the Remington is not nearly that good. To get a decent shave, I have to press pretty hard and go over each area several times. I end up with a bit of redness from the pressing that I have to do to get the shaver to work reasonably well.If you're buying a shaver for $40, save your money and find a Norelco that's on sale."
1,Razor burnnnn!,first off ill start by saying i have sensitive skin.. However i have used many electric razors over the years and this is the first to ever give me razor burn that is actually as bad if not worse then i get from using a regular razor.. it may be because i have to go over each area time and time again to get it to do its job.. not real sure.. i just know that it gives me bad razor burn. and i have given up and ordered a norelco.
2,Mediocre at Best,"I have been using this razor for two years, and it never really performed for me from the beginning. The shave is not even close to resembling a razor shave. The blades give me razor burn worse than a regular razor and the battery life is horrible. I would not recommend this razor unless there is no possible way you can afford a better one.I give it two stars because it has been consistant in its bad performance for two years.This razor is not recommended for snuggling with your lady friend."
3,"a good product, but not fit my skin",itching on the skin after use this product. I'm not sure it's a defect or my sensitive skin.
4,Remington R-845,"I have heard all the hype surrounding Remington and their shaving products but I have always stayed away because of the price. In this case I made a gamble, satisfied with the price, I decided to test it. The hype associated with this brand is well worth it, they clearly know how to make an electric shaver. It contours to my face and gives me the ""closest"" shave I have ever had. It takes a little time to get used to the closeness but your face certainly feels and looks different. You can spend a little more $ and get a more sophisticated model but this model works fine for me. Stick with this brand there's nothing like it!"
4,"Ah, memories!","Why must we analyze everything? For crying out loud, this album got me through middle school, what more is there to say? I'm 24 now and buying it on CD for the sentimental value. Sure, it's no Grammy winner but it's fun and nostalgic--in my opinion, it's a must-have for all children of the '80's."
2,Last Christmas,We only bought this CD for this very special song. No Christmas is complete without this song!
4,Wham!'s swan song,"""Music from the Edge of Heaven"" was Wham!'s farewell disc, a fine blend of sunny pop and blue-eyed soul. Although the songs on this disc have aged well over time, only 3 of the 8 songs here are new. The others are previously released singles (""I'm Your Man,"" ""A Different Corner,"" and ""Last Christmas"") or note-for-note remakes (""Wham Rap 86""). Other than that, this disc is a welcome 1980's flashback from one of the finest duos of its era."
4,80's Sensation!,"A couple of the tracks are mediocre, but there are a lot of great ones too. Wham! is Wham! Most people either love them or hate them. I wasn't exactly thrilled when they first came out, but it didn't take long to get hooked. George Michael writes some excellent songs about love, life and relationships. Also, I could relate to the lyrics because they mirrored what I was experiencing in my life many times. As a result, cherished memories are created.My favorites are: ""The Edge Of Heaven""/""Battlestations""(Surprise favorite)/""A Different Corner""(Love it)/""Blue""(Live in China)/""Where Did Your Heart Go?""/""Last Christmas""(Classic)."
5,Thanks for making the music in CD,"We are ardent listener of WHAM music album, but George Micheal voice is that we are after. It was a great relief to get it in a CD. Thanks again"
5,The Elephant in My Living Room,"This is one amazing book! I was fascinated by the author's story and her journey through a tormented childhood into a whole and safe adulthood. Although the author's faith is obviously strong, I didn't find this to be another pie-in-the-sky ""religious"" book. She describes her difficulty in coming to the act of forgiveness which set her free from the bondage of her terrible memories--and the amazing release of letting go of her rapist's hold on her. She isn't preachy, just very real about what it took to come to peace with her ordeal. I found the study guide to be particularly helpful, allowing me to apply the questions to my own life and situation. Anyone who's ever suffered from abuse or relational difficulties would benefit from reading this. It's truly one of the best books I've ever read!"
5,congradulations to the author!,"I admit, I'm not particularly religious, nor do I think I have many significant elephants in my life (certainly nothing that rises to the level of what the author went through), but despite all this, Ms. Renner's book was a fast and fascinating read. The book is searingly honest, which makes it not only a hopeful guide for others who seek healing through faith, self-awareness and sheer will, but for people like me, it is an open, honest and insightful portrait of someone who has survived an trauma most of us will could never imagine. I have to congradulate the author on such a brave and unflinching achievement. This kind of self-examination and self-critique takes a lot of guts to put onto paper and that it's put down so incisively and with such clarity and detail is truly applaudable."
1,Not Much There,"This book purports to help adult women dealing with unresolved sexual abuse. Instead, it is a trecley text which recommends turning everything over to the Christian god and not worrying about it. Worse, it suggests that if you can't get over sexual abuse this way, it's because there is something wrong with you. It hits you in the head, hard, with the author's religion. I would never recommend this book to anyone dealing with abuse issues. It's great that this strategy worked for the author, but people looking for real information and advice should look elsewhere."
3,"Good story, but ...","I really liked Garnethill. This is a good murder mystery book that definitely takes some unexpected twists and turns. There is a very clever plot, and it leaves you guessing until the end.Some of the writing was a little difficult for me to understand, as the story takes place in Glasgow, and I was unfamiliar with some of the expressions and terms.Also, it was a bit difficult for me to sympathize with Maureen, the main character. She is the main suspect (at least in the beginning) in her (married) lover's murder. It was hard for me to connect to and sympathize with her. She comes from an extremely dysfunctional family, complete with sexual abuse and alcoholism, and I wanted to like her. But it seemed like all she did was drink. I kind of wanted her to rise above her family and be this strong woman (which, by the end, she was, but it was a little too late). However, the plot twists and the ending almost made up for the flaws."
4,Depressingly Wonderful,"This was a great story and very engaging, but also very bleak and sad, which only added to the story. It has to be hard to write a story like this, to show the unhappiness in someone's life and how to turn it around. I read the book over a month ago, so it's harder now to put into words what I felt when I read it, but I've been there, in that place emotionally. The main character seems weak, at first, but as she investigates and works to clear her name, she becomes more...more sure, more aware, more herself. Stronger and able to handle what happens, and she shows her intelligence, getting the murderer/abuser in a most unexpected way that I never would have thought of and made for a great story. I've ordered the second in the series and can't wait to find out what happens next."
4,Better than expected,"If there is such a thing as a feel good murder mystery, Garnethill was it for me. Maureen, because of her flaws and overwhelming empathy, was someone to root for throughout. Her family situation was like a prolonged annual Thanksgiving dinner where everyone who was there, really didn't want to be there. And as the night weans on, things get nasty and feelings get hurt. Garnethill was enough for me to move onto the second book of this trilogy."
4,Down and out in Scotland,"Denise Mina's book Garnethill made me cringe at times while reading - her descriptions of events, places and people leapt out at me without warning like a sucker punch! I wanted to jump into the book and protect the characters from not only the Killer, but also the Mom, and even from each other at times.Great read! Make sure to have a bottle on hand to properly get into it.KUDOS to National Public Radio's interview with Ms Mina which led me straight to Amazon when I heard it."
2,Bad crime,"I finished this book just to see who committed the crime, but I felt the book was too long, quite trashy and not well-crafted. It is written in the third person which comes across as a bit impersonal. The story is ridiculous and unbelievable in parts. There are a lot of typos in the kindle version - just because it's cheaper than the hard copy novel, doesn't mean it shouldn't be edited. I would recommend Tana French as a preferred crime author- her writing is more believable, her stories more gripping."
3,"Good, But a Little Overdone","This is a good book, with creative characters and a grimy setting (Glasgow) but I thought it was a bit overdone. The lead character, Maureen O'Donnell, a victim of incestual abuse and resultant emotional meltdown, sets out to find the murderer of her lover. The search takes her all over Glasgow and through its mental health infrastructure until she IDs and deals with the bad guy. Maureen is a most unlikely sleuth -- although a ticket seller at a cinema she seems to possess insights that rival Sherlock Holmes. But, on the other hand, she is a remarkably well-drawn character, as are most of the others in this first novel. But I still found it a bit overdone. I thought the plot was too long and entirely predictable. Some of the dialogue was too artificially flippant. And Mina has a slight tendency to drift. But, these are small points. Denise Mina has crafted an enjoyable book about unenjoyable subjects: abuse and rape. I'd say it's worth a read."
1,Flat Flatulence,"The ninth sentence, on the first page of the book, last line of the second paragraph is:""Eight long months of emotional turmoil had passed as suddenly as a fart.""Um, had I noticed that line in the store I probably would have ""passed"" on this one (pun intended)."
4,This is the Best of Mina's Books!,"This book is a good read. It focuses on the poverty-stricken Scottish city of Glasgow. In the narrative are domestic violence, alcoholism, the impact of poverty on lives, mental illness and a woman with a history of sexual abuse and past trauma. The protagonist has a deep soul and is a real survivor. Add to all this a riveting mystery, and it combines to make a highly recommended book!"
5,Truth in Advertising,"It's true what they say about the AA50: ""It looks and sounds like a much higher end instrument."" I compared this model, which has laminated sides and back, to an in-shop Ramirez R2 and the AA50 sounded -- and felt -- better. The finish is superb, as good as the Ramirez. Details of the binding are perfect. The fingerboard and body edges are all clean and even sharp (no one leaned on the buffer during finishing). The tone is ""all superlatives."" (It's silly to use words to describe sound, but the notes were clear and distinct, the sounds was not muddy or washed out, the lows were low and the highs were high.) Good string individuation and sustain. It outplayed the Ramirez (+$650), a Cordoba 55RM (+$100), and a used German classical (+$200). I gather the uncompensated saddle allows owners to set up the guitar for the particular strings they will prefer. A fantastic buy all around. I bought the spruce, but the cedar is no doubt as fine."
3,"Plenty of love scenes, but characters are not engaging enough","True to NJ's style, there are plenty of sensual love scenes. But I find she has too much repetitive rambling thoughts going through the character's heads. Some of the actions/thoughts were quite cliché. Overall, it was still quite a fun read."
2,All I can say is..eh,"I'm about half way through this book and lemme tell ya, it's been a struggle. Master of Temptation? I don't think so..Max is neither tempting nor particularly masterful so far. I don't feel like I'm being drawn in to the story at all. It reads more like a laundry list than an actual narrative meant to draw me into the lives of these people. Frankly, I don't care about the main characters. She's mildly interesting because she is so different from other heroines..he's so one dimensional and familiar that he's boring. The dialogue is awful and the sex scenes are worse. At one point, the crucial..ahem..point, he actually says, ""Heal me, my angel."" I mean, blech. I can only hope that it gets better once the story picks up otherwise I may not finish it."
4,book review,As always Nicole Jordan's books are entertaining. This book is a series. I read every book available by this author. All of them were great.
3,My least favorite Nicole Jordan novel,"I hated the guy Max, he was way to arrogant and full of himself. He was very sought after by women - I don't particularly care for romances where the female feels she lacks beauty / charm / whatever, and the male is the opposite. Also the ""Guardians"" thing was totally hokey, I've thought that in the other Guardian books but this one really laid it on thick with King Arthur's Excaliber and all.I really liked 'Prince of Pleasure' so started reading Nicole Jordan, but I don't much like her Cyrene / Guardian series, although 'Lord of Seduction' was pretty good."
3,fun; but lack of character development,"Mutant X season one ends where it should have started - with the possibility of a strong nemesis for the Mutant X team. While the season one foe was constant, he only had 3 lines, was it, that he got to repeat for every episodes. The Mutant X characters only began to grow as an ensemble and with personalities in the last few episodes. Perhaps the authors thought action-only would hold the storylines. There was also much greater possibility for moving the storylines a bit deeper. Compare this with another sci-fi type show, say ... Angel, there is action, but there is not the care for the characters that Angel had. I hope that further seasons will reveal better writing and character work."
1,Looks like a great series,"This looks like a great series, but unfortunatly the packing is horrible. I ordered it, only to get a copy with a loose and scratched disc. A replacement order was sent, but the case was crushed and several discs were loose. This isn't Amazon.com's fault, it is poor packing design by the manufacturer. Don't get this set until that issue has been resolved."
1,"Garbage .n. i.e. waste, unusable articles, liter",The fact that this show still stands proves that America should make like Atlantis and sink!
4,A bit of background,"Many years ago I owned a Columbia LP called ""archie and mehitabel"" with Carol Channing, Eddie Bracken and David Wayne as cat, roach and ""boss"" respectively. Foolishly I lent it to a student and never saw it again. When the Broadway play came out titled Shinebone Alley, it used all the songs from this 25 minute (or so) LP side and added more songs of less distinction. I never heard the original cast LP of that show at all. Since then I have hunted high and low for the original LP or the Shinbone Alley LP with Eartha Kitt. If anyone out there has either for sale, please let me know right quick. This video, then, was a blessing to me in that I at least have all the songs back again. I still cannot understand some lines sung by the chorus and Channing does tend to bury enunciation under her singing style. So I could use a copy of the script also. Help, anyone?"
1,poor quality,"I saw this movie as a child so I was expecting to enjoy it again. You can never go back! That is not the worst of it.... the quality on the dvd is pretty bad, like it was recorded from a vhs and burned from someone's laptop. pathetic"
2,models covered,"If you have a motor made before 1955 I would pass on this book,so far I have found NO INFORMATION for motors made prior to this date."
5,Awesome Introduction to Old Outboards,"I could kick myself. I gave away a 1958 Evinrude just before I read this book. Now I'm sure I could have fixed it myself - probably in short order. I've had little exposure to working on anything mechanical, but this book is very clear and simple.Max takes you step by step through exactly what he would do if he bought an older used outboard to evaluate it and set it up to run forever. That was exactly what I always wished I could have in print.One reviewer has complained that it doesn't cover pre-1955 motors well and that is correct. Max basically recommends against buying an earlier motor, so spends no time on them. The motors covered here are mid-50's through early/mid 70's."
5,Impossible to put down.,"1967 has been called rock and roll's greatest year and music is always playing somewhere in WHITE RABBIT. Fragments of songs sprinkled in the text prompt frequent nostalgia trips. The Viet Nam war's effect on many characters' lives also resonates with the effect the Iraq war has on lives today. This was a terrific book, successful on every side! The characters and language of the time are right on and the story is compelling. As all the forces come together, WHITE RABBIT becomes impossible to put down."
5,"A ""discovery"" that I am glad to have made","Until the recent re-release of this album from '85, I thought Nancy's ""rebirth"" was to be found in the later release ""Forbidden Lover"". Both were produced by Kiyoshi Itoh and feature top-notch arrangements and the unequaled vocal artistry of Miss Wilson.The singer is at her most alluring on ""Early Morning,"" ""Winter Green and Summer Blue,"" and the title cut. Her remake of Wham's ""Careless Whisper"" puts the original to shame. The final track ""If We Were Lovers"" should be requested by anyone fortunate to attend one of her concerts.I know if I should I be so lucky, I definitely will do just that."
5,Soul Satisfaction!,"This collection of songs from Nancy Wilson brings satisfying fulfillment. ""American Wedding Song"" is a gorgeous ballad. Nancy's passionate voice fills ""Winter Green And Summer Blue"" with drama. The title song ""Keep You Satisfied"" smoulders. Nancy's voice is smooth on ""Heaven Bound"", an uptempo, jazzy song. No song is beyond Nancy's talent. And she proves it on ""Careless Whisper"". The arrangements for every song on this cd are very fine. The tour de force of this collection is the finale ""If We Were Lovers"". Treat yourself to one of the greatest singers of all time!"
3,Genius In The Age Of Dilbert,"A unique genius like Crumb is ill suited to collaborative work, the Pekar series is not representative Crumb."
2,Not top class Crumb.,The best things in this collection were done by Crumb alone.I cannot understand why he chose to illustrate the Pekar stories-they are exceptionally dull .There is little of the unique view of the world that I love from Crumbs own tales Completists will want it but its not value for money..
5,Weight Distribution Bracket,"Great piece. It fit just right. Matched privious installed bracket. I research other brackets, none compare to Reese construction and strenghth."
5,Great book from a great story teller,"This is a great book by one of the best authors on the subject. Mr Kaniut is an authority on the subject of bear attacks. He has devoted many hours, days and trips across Alaska to bring first hand accounts, when possible, not only by the victims but by tracking down witnesses to the attacks. I have read several of his books and never been disappointed. This is a must read for the outdoor and wildlife enthusiast. A book that will stay in your bookcase for a re-read."
5,A must have to educate yourself on PCOS,After years of going to OB/GYNs with all the classic symptoms of PCOS I was never told that I had this problem. This problem of PCOS has greatly effected my life. After seeking treatment for PCOS with a REproductive Endocrinologist I have had great success in reducing some of the symptoms. I wish that I had this book when I was a teenager when all the symptoms started to show up. This book is a great reference to anyone with PCOS or family. You MUST educate yourself on PCOS if you have it. You can NOT count on your DR to educate you on PCOS.
2,way over my head...but my OBGYN recomends it,"this book, was well lets just say way over my head BUT.... my OBGYN suggested so I am sure if you are more dedicated than me you would enjoy it."
2,Too technical,"This book was obviously written by a doctor and is written so that only other doctors can understand it. It would have been nice to have this complicated syndrome explained for the everyday person. If you can get through all the technical mumbo jumbo, then it's a good book."
1,Next to worthless,"There is nothing in here that's worth the price tag touted. I find the other reviewers ocmments dubious at best, there is so little of merit in this Q&A book. You could not even give yourself a self-diagnosis (that you suspect this disease) based on this book.Thatcher gives no real information that one cannot get off the web and ZERO about the diet/exercise condition other than 'he thinks so'. Go with instead the newly published PCOS DIet Book by Colette Harris & save your money here."
5,DR. THATCHER IS WONDERFUL...BOOK IS A MUST HAVE,I can tell you that this book is very helpful with anyone with PCOS. Dr. Thatcher is actually my doctor and he is wonderful. He is very educated in this field. He stays on top of the newest research and is a great doctor. I can not say enough good things about him. I would recommend this book for anyone who suffers this disease and if you have daughters that may end up with similar symptoms. This would be a wonderful reference guide to help know what to expect. He really helps give the patient a guide to help them understand this disease and to help be able to discuss these symptoms with their doctors to get quality medical care.
3,"Define ""Massive""","I've been using this stuff almost every day for the last couple of months, trying to get the feel for it. I've come to the conclusion that I don't really like it, but it's better than mousse because at least it leaves your hands slimey instead of sticky. I would say it does slightly add volume to my straight, fine hair....but it does this by making my hair oily....almost like I skipped washing it that day. I just use it on my roots...I don't know what would happen if you used it all over.It definitely doesn't provide any heat protection, or split-end help...so don't buy it for that. I use large curlers with it and hair spray, but any way I style with it, my hair is still flat in an hour or two. It's not a magic cure.All in all, not worth the money. Just buy mousse or gel instead."
2,"""Massive Wet Noodle""","Crap!... Nah.. I mean, I'm glad it works for most of you.. at least it seems like it. In my opinion it should be named ""Massive Wet Noodle"". I actually didn't get any volume out of this product and it doesn't lather very well either. On the flip side it smells great (I could smell my hair all day), and it made it soft. So... it has its pros and cons."
2,"volume, but tons static!","I tried this when it first came out, It did give my hair volume but it also gave me alot of static & a dry feeling ( making it very hard to style). I tried it do to reveiws & beauty awards by several magazines, but I was very disappionted. After trying it several time I ended up tossing it"
3,meh,"its an alright product. smells alright. I don't use too much, just a little bit at the roots, and then sleep on that. In the morning i have perfect bedhead....because i just woke up.."
2,What does this actually do...,"I had this product on the shelf for over a year. Everyime I used it, except for making my hair a bit easier to comb through, I wondered: what is this product supposed to be doing?Maybe I got the one that was diluted with water at the store-- because I could never figure it out... As a disclaimer, I do have naturally thick hair so maybe that is a reason this never impressed me much.I finally emptyed my bottle and recycled it to make room for some better products on my shelf."
2,"Great Apron, for a child","This looked to be a great apron in person, heavy duty sturdy ties etc. However it is sized better to fit a 10 year old rather than an adult, my staff looked absolutely ridiculous in these things, how about measurements on these things?"
2,Custom Leathercraft Bib Apron,"The material was quite heavy but the apron is a very small pattern size, more like a child's apron. I liked the pockets but I prefer the regular type ties and neck bands. I would look for one that meets all my needs the next time."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this razor about a year ago mainly for rare occasional use when out of town. At home I use ""regular"" manual razors with shaving foam/gel. I purchased this Remington due to its low price (one star), and it still runs (second star). That's about it. Like other reviewers stated, it does not do a good job overall. It is particularly bad on the neck and jaw line, even with several passes and multiple directions. It is also loud. If you plan on daily use of a main razor, DO NOT get this. Either look else where or stick with manual razors."
5,Don't listen to anyone!,"It's a good shaver for starters... unless your name is Big Foot! I mean, i work at the place that sells shavers (can't mention the name here, because it's an unofficial review) and we have so many alternatives, but after all the feedback and looking into it, I bought this one.The only minus is it's Rechargeable ONLY. But, it gives a close shave... Yeah. it's very noisy, but people who say it's too noisy really are not familiar with Remington brand (they all are noisy)...I would reccomend it to anyone, especially first-timers.P.S. Although, PocketGO 370 from Braun, which I recently tried, is much better."
1,Didn't Last A Month,"I was shaving my face with the SF3 shaver and felt a stinging on my face. I turned the shaver off and found two holes in the micro screen. I had a nice red ""W"" carved on my cheek from this shaver. I bought this shaver to replace a 20 year old Ronson shaver that has never given me any problems. I am still waiting to hear from Remington Products on this matter. This SF3 shaver didn't last a month from the date of purchase."
4,Unfortunately I destroyed it by mistake,"The shaving machine working just fine, but unfortunately the recharging working with 110W, and I put it in 220W, then the battery was dissolved, now I can't recharging it."
3,nice shape but not a real close shave,"I got this as a backup for my old Braun electric that I've used forever since I like single head screen razors and it was inexpensive. I do like the shape, being thin to hold and with the angle that is helpful. It holds a charge well and is easy to clean. As a backup razor it's been nice.Unfortunately I broke my old braun so this became my primary razor. It's definitely not as good or as close. I have to spend a lot more effort to get even a semi-decent shave and I always have to use a little bic blade razor to get a few places this misses (especially hairs on the neck lying down).So, I'm looking into a replacement. Again, good as a backup or perhaps as a cheap razor, but don't rely on it for closeness."
2,Handle and Turn action is very Bad,"The is a fairly large plastic pump. The handle is plastic and inserts into a plastic hole with ridges. Attempting to turn the handle is very stiff and clunky. It doesn't turn smoothly. It takes a lot of effort to get this thing to actually pump. I got mine to siphon gas from my car during snow storms only to learn that all new cars have anti-siphon screens and you can't do it. Basically all I use this for is draining lawn mower,generator, and tractor gas for winter storage. Frankly I have another hand pump that is far superior so this one will get little use till the other wears out. I would not recommend this device --its a crude tool."
5,It IS great!!,"I just went to the store to buy Toki Tori, after reading the review on pocket.ign.com. And damn what a game it is! It just looks great! It plays great! It feels great! It IS great!!I think I'm addicted.. 6 out of 5 stars."
4,Toki Tantrum...Is this Game Putting Stress on Kids?,"I have had high hopes for this game but it dissapointed me.I personally did not like or approve of the weapons and tools.I am afraid it will be the next ""Pokemon."" It can be a very frustrating game.I beat in about 7 days of doing almost nothing else ...it was hard.But to see if kids would like it I gave it to my son.He had passed the 1st 4 levels with ease.He is a video game wiz kid so he got passed the other 6,but it was a challenge.Right there before my very eyes I saw my boy crying because he could not get passed a level.I remember this with ""Pokemon.""That is all I have to say..."
5,Brother and Sisters Series 4,I only started watching Brother's and Sister's from series 4 and was immediatly hooked I went on line to purchase series 1 -3 so I could catch up. I think all the acting is superb am really impressed with the actor who plays 'Luc' can't wait for the DVD to be produced for the British market and so looking forward to Series 5 although I shall miss Rob Lowe.
3,Brothers and Sisters 4,This series had a damaged dvd....I have contacted Amazon to no avail. Just want a replacement but it is not happening.Beware ordering a seies of several dvd's unless you can view them all within 30 days to meet the return guidelines.Amazon should have the integrity of LLBean!
4,Good but fragile careful!,"I got this last year for my boyfriend who is into music. It took a while to learn but once he did it was a lot of fun. This is a good little instrument with nice sound and good quality for the price.We were sad however when it broke. Is a very thin shell, and he had it in his car and it was smashed.If your careful this can be lots of fun"
1,Not Worth Buying,I bought this as an accessory to a halloween costume. It was cheaply made and broke very quickly. It never made a sound.
3,Ok for the price,"I purchased this at a local store about a week ago. The air in CO is dry dry dry and my cool mist wasn't cutting it. I didn't want the hassle with warm mist cleaning and filters so that left a vaporizer. I do like the ease of this machine. No filter, not much cleaning other than a rinse when filling up, not a lot of separate parts to deal with. Simple. The night list isn't horribly bright. I think my cable box light is brighter. So what's the problem? It doesn't last through the night. I actually leave a pitcher of water next to it in order to add more water. My other issue is the claim it automatically shuts off. I have yet to see that function even after it ran ""dry."" That brings me into another complaint. This machine does not run dry. There can be a couple inches of water in the base but no steam is generated. Wasteful in my opinion. But the cost should tell you it isn't the Rolls Royce of vaporizers and you're not going to get a phenomenal item."
1,Not a fan,"I've used several bedroom humidifiers, and this is my least favorite. This unit was more difficult to clean than others I have used, and it had to be cleaned more often. I also felt that this unit was less convenient to fill up than other designs I have used. I understand why a pinch of salt is needed to operate this device, but I have never used any other humidifiers which required me to add salt. When it was full it never lasted more than about 10 hours, even though the description says 18-24 hour operation. This unit felt very cheaply made compared to other units I have used and stopped working after 2 months. There are much better options out there, choose something else."
2,Disappointed and returning,I purchased this humidifier a few days ago. I get extremely dry sinuses in the winter and finally broke down and bought a humidifier to run while I'm sleeping. It helped a lot with the dry sinuses. So mission accomplished. This humidifier is not what it seems though. I purchased because the product description said a full tank of water would get me 18-24 hours of run time. It burns through the water so quickly it doesn't make it through the night. I sleep about 6 hours and this thing runs out of water around that mark. I read the instruction manual and followed the instructions for fixing this problem. It recommended doctoring the water because it was either too hard or too soft. I started mixing the tap water with distilled. It didn't really help much. I know this is just a cheap model but I'd like it to at least do what the box is advertising. I don't think that is asking too much. I'm returning and going to purchase a better model.
4,Good value for Money,HiI had purchased a 25$ humidifier earlier but I could hardly see any impact. This generates a good amount of steam and is more of a vaporiser but serves the purpose. Good enough for the bed room esp at night when the heater is full on. We also use it for inhalation when we have cold so its multipurpose and worth the spend. I have been using it for the last few months and have no complaints.
4,Works as described.,The only thing I would change about this unit is an on/off switch and better finger grips to turn and take off the top. I have to use two hands most of the time. I pull this out only when one of us is sick. When we are done with it I let it dry out and then put it in the closet. I have had it for probably about a year and have used it on maybe 3 separate occasions 3-4 nights each time. Aside from having to add salt to the water I have never had an issue getting a good amount of steam going. We only use it at night and one tank of water lasts at least 2 nights. When/if this one dies I will buy another just like it. It is simple and easy to use.
5,Had this for years and still working great,I have had this humidifier for years and it is still working great. I am in the market for another one for our downstairs. As I am making this purchase I noticed a lot of unhappy users saying it sputters and doesn't emit vapor. READ THE DIRECTIONS! You are directed to add some salt. Some areas in which people live do not have enough salt in their water and you must add some yourself.
1,"Worst humidifier ever, but what can you expect for what it costs?","I've gone through about 2 or 3 of these. They work great for a little while, but then it just quits functioning normally, even with cleaning. I have hard water so that didnt make it any better. I would say skip this one, save your money and buy a better quality one."
5,works well,"Own a couple of these for office room and home, very happy with it.Use it a lot in the winter months, partly due to dry heat from the AC(irritates and swells nasal passages) and also due to the reason that I live in the allergy capital of the world (dry eyes, sinus issues, hay fever).I fill it up every day and keep it running and humidifies the room very well. You may want a couple if you have a large large rooms or in living areas, it works well in my office which about 14ftX12ft and bedrooms ~ 20ftx20ftIts funny to read the negative reviews. Not sure what people expect out of this for 10-15$, but it blows steam as required, 1.5 gallons over 10 hours. cleaning is easy and best bang for the buck ."
2,Worked great the first two nights but then quit,"I have grown up using a vaporizer for colds and when my 7 month old caught her first cold I thought I would use it to help her sleep at night. First of all if you have soft water you must put salt in it every night dispite the claim in the instructions that you shouldn't have to do so more then once or twice to get it to work. First night I had to use two servings of the recommended salt content and it worked great after that. All night long! Second night I used only one serving due to the instructions warning that if you use too much salt it can burn out the motor and then you are screwed. It started to work and worked for a couple hours, but when I checked on my baby around 2am it had quit. Third night I again used one serving of salt and it did nothing the whole nite. For the money I didn't waste much but now I have to find another one so my child can sleep at night. The first night it worked the best but I took it back and got a refund."
4,Works great for such a simple device!,"This is just what I wanted. It is fairly quiet, sounds like its raining outside. Our air is very dry during the winter so wanted something to put moisture back in the air. Turn it on at night in the bedroom and it goes til morning. Automatic turn off if the water gets too low. I haven't used any inhalants."
4,If you have kids you need this!,We probably use this almost every other week during the winter. We have purchased two of these now because we wore out the old one. Because the first one broke I took away one star but it did endure some abuse. It is a great value for the money and helps tremendously if you have a child that needs it.
2,Disappointing,"I agree with the other reviewers that say this V150 Vaporizer doesn't put out much steam. Mine starts steaming in about 10 minutes, but it's a minimal amount. It really doesn't add as much moisture to the air as I'd hoped and my throat still feels dry. I've been leaving it on all night and there's still plenty of water in it next morning. But that's because it doesn't make much steam.I'm surprised no one has mentioned how noisy it is. It gurgles and makes boiling noises all night. The instructions say to use 1/8 teaspoon of salt if you live in an area where the water has low mineral content, or it won't steam. They also say too much salt will make it boil over. Well, I live in an area with low mineral content, but even with no salt added it makes the gurgly boiling noises, even though it never boils over.I'm going to have to buy another humidifier. I really need something for my cough, but the V150 isn't really doing the job."
3,Great but a power sucker!,"I've been using this for past couple months. No issues whatsoever, keeps the room very moist. Perhaps too moist, condensation coming off the windows and forming molds on window sills.If you are very conscious about your electricity bill, please skip this unit at all cost! Using a P3 kill-a-watt and this vaporizer is using average about 830 watts per hour. About three times as much as my living room computer + 42"" LCD TV. BE AWARE!"
1,Smelled like burning plastic,"I purchased this to use in my one-year-old's room. I specifically got this one because it has the plastic protector so he doesn't burn himself if he somehow touched it. Well, I have been disappointed on all fronts.Even after rinsing it out, the unit smelled like burned plastic when I plugged it in. I added salt, I made sure not to fill it above the fill line, I followed the directions perfectly but it still stunk! I was worried and did not want my son to be inhaling burned plastic! I thought to myself that maybe it just smells that way because this is the first time it was used. I set it up in the guest room and used it three other times and each time, it still smelled like burned plastic. Worst of all, even with the steam guard, you still burn your fingers if you touch it.I figured I gave this thing enough chances and wound up returning it."
3,Have to add a lot of salt,"I had to add a lot of salt to this vaporizer, regardless of the instructions to only add ""pinches."" But after I did, the steam came pouring out. Frustrated, but glad it's working now."
1,burnt plastic - very little steam,"i remember as a kid vaporizers pumping out some serious steam... this does almost nothing. very little steam at all. the worst part, it smells like plastic is burning. now if your sick and needing a vaporizer, i can't imagine burnt plastic is going to be helping your condition. Vicks is a good company, but this product is terrible."
2,Inefficient electricity usage,"Plusses:* Boiling is a good way to kill any bacteria in the water.* Constant gurgling sound is sort of relating, kinda like falling rain.Minus:* Power consumption exceeds 350W, see photo. This equates to about one dollar a day to operate, depending on your electricity cost. (Ultrasonic humidifiers use about 1/10 this amount.)* No adjustments, not even an on/off switch.* Steam and boiling water may be dangerous for a child.* 1-2 gallon per day output is enough for a very small room only.* Emits slight burning smell when operating, apparently the rods burning.We didn't mind the built-in night-light, although it would be better if it could be disabled."
3,Started smoking after 4 years,"We bought this unit 4-5 years ago and used it for colds. Easy to use... loved it. A week ago my husband had a cold and had it in his office. He was in the room when he noticed the vaporizer seemed to kick into high gear--the steam turned white and really started coming out. Turned out it was smoke.We are just thankful it didn't happen in the kids' room at night!I just did a search on this product and a couple people have had this issue--and associated it with black flakes in the water. We didn't have any water discoloration- one minute it seemed to be working fine, the next it was smoking. We have hard water--maybe going too long between cleanings caused it to burn out.Maybe we had it running for too long.Always remember to have working smoke detectors when you have a vaporizer running!"
3,"good value, no filter needed but u still need to clean it","i bought this based on the reviews i read on amazon, and was very happy with the purchase. That is, until i realize that even though it doesn't come with filters like other humidifiers do, I still need to do a weekly cleaning, otherwise, you'll see green gook at the bottom of the container and around the steamer. oh well, i guess it was too good to be true to find a humidifier that doesn't need to be cleaned. however, it is the easiest to use humidifier out there and one of the cheapest too."
2,Disappointed,"When I was little I remember having a humidifier that put out so much steam it was hard to get around because it had so much coming out of it, my how things have changed. When I got this unit I was hoping for the came effect however that was not the case. Steam barely comes out of it at all, now on the box it does state that if you aren't getting the flow of steam that you want to add salt to the water. Yes that does make the steam start to roll out of it good, only problem is that is will steam itself out very quickly. When I get the steam the way I want it won't even last 7 hours.If you have a small area and aren't looking for that much steam then this might be okay, I will be bringing this to my office to use. However if you have a larger room and like to have a lot of steam then this is not the product for you. Take the money you would spend on this and put it toward a better machine."
3,I really like this. ..,I really like this product. But the capacity of water is too small. I mean the time is too short to maitain all the night..
2,Feed me!,"This unit works very well for steam output. I used mere tap water with no salt and it cranked out steam like a locomotive. Sadly, it woke me up twice last night when it got low on water...sounded like the thing had a cold or something. I fed it more water each time like a good Daddy, but it made for a rough night's sleep. Too much maintenance for a machine, if you ask me."
1,Not worth a dime,"I don't understand. I bought this thing off season using coupons because it was so cheap and I figured if it worked once it would pay for itself. Well today I needed it and brand new straight out of the box it did nothing. No steam, not a sputter. I left it plugged up all night thinking it would kick in at some point. Nothing. I tried the salt thing. Nothing. Nothing. The thing is worth nothing. If I knew what happened to my receipt I would certainly return it but it was paid for months ago. Good thing I didn't invest a lot in it."
1,Be Cautious,"I think this is a fire hazard plain and simple. I would never leave this in a child's room unattended day or night. The unit works, but I don't trust it. There is no on/off switch, just a plug. You have to manually plug or unplug the unit. The area around the machine becomes saturated with water and it makes me uneasy going near the electrical socket in the morning to unplug the machine.It is inexpensive, but I would go for a higher-end humidifier next time. Also, I live in NYC and had to add some salt to the water in order for it to generate a decent amount of steam, so remember to have some salt handy. The unit worked so much better after I added a couple of pinches of salt.I would not recommend this unit."
1,Doesnt work,It doesnt work!!! Im mad i paid money for something that doesnt work. How annoying it is . I want a refund
2,Not Great,I have gone through three of these and they stop working after three to four weeks of use. I think they are junk and I am going to try the Crane brand and see if it is better.
4,good for what it's worth,"It humidifies my air plenty (after a few pinches of salt) but it does not have any type of humidity meter or on and off switch. It will simply spew vapor out until it runs out of salt, water, or when you unplug it. I also find it annoying that the night light doesn't go off, since it turns part of my white ceiling green in the complete darkness. It seems very safe, but is also an awkward shape and looks funny wherever you put it. It does it's job though"
1,Where's the steam?,"This vaporizer worked great for the first 2 days. After that, we had to do the vinegar deep-cleaning procedure to get maybe 10 minutes' worth of steam out of it before it would stop again. We followed the directions precisely, including adding salt to the water. The vaporizer would get hot, but no steam would come out."
3,Give it a Change,"I followed the instructions exactly for this unit. The first night there was no steam (including trying the salt as directed). It also made lots of gurgling sounds. The next day we bought an unknown brand name unit from a pharmacy, as I was going to return the Amazon ""vicks"" one. That evening I set the new unit it and it worked perfectly right away. Great steam. Just for the heck of it, I set up the Vicks unit again and added salt right away - about a half of teaspoon, which is more than the ""Pinch"" amount the directions say to add. I also only added about one gallon of water instead of adding it to the line. Although it did not steam as well as the ""off brand"" I bought, it worked. So if you have bought this unit, give it a second chance. Regardless, after years of being a household name (VICKS), you would think the unit would perform the one function it has without issue."
2,Okay for price,"We've bought two of these and they last less than a year. We are looking to buy a better quality one for the next purchase. Also, I find it hard to clean."
2,Fuse-blower!,"I bought mine at a Target after my sis-in-law raved about the one she uses. She has not experienced any issues with hers, but me on the other hand...After I fill the tank up to the fill-line with water and plug it in, it puts on a show by blasting a 3-foot jet of steam into the air! Whee! Shortly after, Vicks blows the fuse. Then I am left in the dark. This only happens when the Vicks in plugged into the circuit that runs though my bedroom. It has worked fine on the first-level of my house.A lot of grey crud fills up the tank as well."
4,Mostly happy with it,"I love that there are no filters to replace. With humidifiers, you end up paying far more in the cost of filters than for the humidifier. My last cool mist humidifier also ended up leaking gallons of water all over the floor after several years of use. The steam is not too hot when I put my hand in it. Don't keep the door and all the windows closed -- I woke up one morning to soaked walls. Otherwise, it works well. My throat isn't painfully dry when waking up, and my skin isn't as ashy when I use the vaporizer. I don't know what the black particles in the water are either. I'm going to keep looking through reviews, hoping for an explanation."
1,Not pleased...,"I bought this unit while pregnant to use and then thought it would be great to use when I had my children... Ruined the night table I had it on while pregnant (literally spitting water), and had to scrub my bedroom walls due to the water running down the walls (was only sitting at bed level). Have tried using for children when sick and the same issues. Last night was my last night trying it... Worked fine at first, then when I had to refill the tank, it began to ""spit"" very hot water at me (could have been on children had they been close enough), have had to scrub the bedroom walls today where the water ran down the walls, and it is loud, especially when it decides to ""spit"". Due to the extremely hot water spitting, I say this unit is just not safe, especially for a child's room. I am fine with the hot steam, but hot water should not be spitting across the room. I am always sure not to overfill so this is not the issue."
1,It doesn't work sometimes,"It works good at the beginning. But it works really bad recently, after I got it one month. There's nearly no vapor."
1,TOO NOISY,"I had an older version of this that worked great for 10 years then finally quit emitting steam so bought this new one and it was horrible. It makes a gurgling noise about every 2 minutes, just enough to keep you awake and bug the heck out of you. I tried everything to fix it, more water, less water, etc. nothing fixed it. I have to get rid of it because my kids can't sleep when it's in their room because right when they are nodding off, that stupid gurgle sound happens again. A bit annoying."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"Nothing special, just keeps my room from getting super dry. Works nicely for the price."
4,great little vaporizer,"We purchased a second one of these for our baby's room since his sister and he had colds at the same time. It's quiet, efficient, and holds enough water to last overnight. I like the reservoir for vicks vaposteam, and the act that it doesn't need a filter like a humidifier. The steam is probably hot enough to burn, but our kids are still in cribs. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the nightlight is too bright and can't be turned off. I had to put black electrical tape over it to try and dim it. My kids sleep best in total darkness."
4,30 Days Later...,"I have no major complaints about this product at all. Considering the price it is a no remorse purchase. I do have to add a dash of salt to get it steaming, but the local elevation is about 4,200ft. Water does take a bit more energy to boil at this altitude. I use it overnight (8-12 hours) and have never ran out of water. An on/off switch would be a desirable addition, but unplugging it works just as well."
1,Horrible returned it,No mist?Not hot?Did not work at all?Returned it for another vicks brand with warm mist.Vick brand is good just not this product.
1,Vicks 1.5 Gal. Vaporizer - Not for Softened Water!,"We bought one and it kept blowing circuit breakers. Upon examination, I found that if you have a water softener that uses salt, this Vicks vaporizer is no good unless you buy a few jugs of distilled water to use, and then follow directions. Reason: Water softeners that use salt, load up the water with sodium ions. The sodium ions in the water cause the vaporizer to drawn a lot of current and blow your circuit breakers."
1,A waste of money,"Apparently, any brand of warm mist vaporizer that you buy that costs around $20.00 is made by Kaz. Mine is sold under CVS' label. As others have said it produces a minimum amount of steam with a maximum amount of fuss and bother. If you didn't have a headache before you used the vaporizer you will after you try to use it."
1,Beware of KAS products,"KAS makes this thing and they make dangerous stuff.I bought both KAS (Vicks) humidifiers V745A and rwm-975n and they both had the same problem. THEY LEAK WATER ALL OVER THE FLOOR! One leaks from the cap, the other leaks no matter how you mount the water tank. A coincidence? No, KAS makes horrible humidifiers."
1,This is piece of junk,"Only after 3 weeks, this humidifier is not working any more, it only heat up the water in the container, and no water was consumed within 3 days."
1,Creates only a small amount of steam,"I would not buy this again. It creates only a small amount of steam. Adding salt increased the amount of steam somewhat, but then the thing started to sputter water. When I was a kid my grandparents had a vaporizer that put out a LOT of steam. I have no idea what brand that old vaporizer was. This Vicks vaporizer probably has more safety features than that old vaporizer, but it doesn't create nearly as much steam. There must be better vaporizers out there, but I don't know what to recommend. (Incidentally, I did not buy it from Amazon. I needed it NOW, so I went to a local pharmacy to buy it.)"
3,Vick's vaporizer,Does what it is supposed to do. It is interesting that we need to put salt in every time we use it. Not a big problem...just not expected.
5,Vaporizer Review,I love it. I just wish I knew how to keep the calcium build-up out of the system. You always need to take it apart and clean the heating units. Regardless what kind of water... any ideas?
4,Adds moisture to dry air too!,This product is just what I needed. Supports better sleep at night and is an ideal way to put moisture in the dryness of winter air.
3,To Hard,The little knobs on this pad are not very comfortable to sit on. Also the heat is not very warm. The message is pretty good. But noise level is to high. I would like to be able to keep the heat on without the message. I am going to return this and look for another.
5,This kicks Homedics Butt!!!,"(. . .)The product is well made, gives a deep massage and the heat is spectacular. This is a must buy"
2,Fun but not educational - those are my child's words,"Looks like this would be a fun and educational tool but fun is all we got out of it. That's fine but if you're really looking for the educationally portion as well, it was a disappointment, at least for my child. Every child learns differently so this may or may not work for your child(ren)."
4,Thumbs up for Sponge Bob's Salty Sea Stories,My 7 year old daughter really enjoys this Leap Pad book! There are lots of fun and educational activities for kids in the 6 - 9 yr. age range.
5,It was like DUDE!,"Great book, it gets you from the start and keeps you the whole time. Everyone should have the oppertunity to be able to read this. By the way, Nufer is a cool name."
1,Warning! This is not a .Net book,"This book is a rehash of older reference material on MFC. Despite the fact that MFC has changed very little over the course of the last several years, 29 out of the book's 35 chapters cover MFC. Material covering managed code is tacked on in the last 6 chapters."
3,Good but too quick,"Having taken a beginners Flamenco class, I wanted to continue to practice without forgetting all the moves, while away. This DVD is lovely and so is Ms. Puela, However, I wish she'd taken a little slower approach. Doing ""like this:"" with your hands, won't really TEACH you how to do the quite complex hand/ arm/ fingers movements , on which I have been working with a private teacher over a good several hours. Spending extra 5 minutes at the beginning, JUST on fingers, wrist and elbows, would be exactly what is needed, in my opinion.If you are a quick learner, can watch and imitate, or if you just want to get the general sense of Flamenco, then this video is good for you."
2,Very weak performer,"The video came in in record time and the seller is great, but the video is not good. I used to dance Flamenco and just wanted a routine video to practice on my own, but this is not it. I don't know this performer, but she does not compare to my maestra Ana Esmeralda and others that I observed. Her hands are not like ""palomas"", her feet not strong, she sometimes are out of measure and beat... very disappointing..."
5,Great buy!,"Great boots, warm, comfortable, and fashionable.I read other reviews before I bought it regarding buying a half size up, and it was a wise decision. Since it is furry all the way inside, the fur takes room, so I would recommend buying a 1/2 size up.Love it."
1,Very disappointed,"The gummy worms were fine. I put them in little scary cups and gave them to the neighbor children for Halloween, and they loved them. But honestly, $5 for the candy and $5 for the shipping is a little out of line for the sad little shrink bag of about 30 worms. I won't purchase candy through Amazon again."
5,Yummy gummy worms,I bought these gummy worms for my boyfriend who is somewhat of a gummy worms connoisseur. He said they were definitely one of the better gummy worms he's had and that the gummy worms were fresh definitely made it more enjoyable.
1,No muy interesante,"Esperaba algo con más vuelo. Me resultó demasiado grosero en algunas partes. En inglés, la traducción suaviza el lenguaje, pero en español se trata de una grosería epatante y muchas veces gratuita. No es mi idea de lo que debe ser la literatura."
3,"Simple and effective, but pricey.","This sliding trash bin is quite simple to install and works like a charm, but does it really need to cost so much? There's no getting around the price, however, unless you can fabricate your own. The product itself is great though. I think it took me a grand total of ten minutes to open, read the instructions and install this product in my kitchen."
