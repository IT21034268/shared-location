2,You get what you pay for...,"Had this watch for one and a half years when the push buttons started sticking while depressed. Finally, they became useless. If you look at the guts, it just cheap plastic. This was my first of two Casios in the last three years (my last was the Sea Analog which quit on me after only one year). NO MORE! Don't let yourself be mesmerized by the price and looks, unless you want to replace your watch every year or two."
3,Casio AMW320R,Nice watch but needs a new battery. Both Casio watches I bought from Amamzon need batteries. They sit in a drawer now.
1,Skip It,"Purchased the watch because: 1) Looked like a great deal; 2) Has great reviews; and, 3)Watch looks sharp. However, the watch does not work well, has died three time in 90 days. Further, the watch strap is VERY uncomfortable and tends to make you happy to remove the watch. Last but not least Casio has never respond to any requests for hel..nor as Amazon (THANK YOU AMAZON for not even a e-mail response). My strong recommendation: SKIP IT."
3,not much to read here,"I read this book in about an hour, every other page has a picture on it, however, the book is interesting, i just thought there could have been more to it. The pictures in it were great though as i had never seen a lot of them. So if you're looking for a long book this isn't for you, but if you're looking for an easy read with some great historical pictures, then you might want to check it out."
3,Kiss of Death,"Erle Stanley Gardner's THE CASE OF THE CRIMSON KISS, FINGERS OF FONG, THE VALLEY OF LITTLE FEARS, CROOKED LIGHTNING and AT ARM'S LENGTH is a short case for the range of the author's skills to keep the reader turning the page.Just the item to tuck in a beach bag for a good read.The above stories are combined with Mignom G. Eberhart's TWO LITTLE RICH GIRLS for an enjoyable full-length novel. The ending for the Eberhart story is well worth the read as things do not always work out as one thinks.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS"
4,Books of Mixed Merit,"The book I've read consists of several novellas, including the title novel. Perry Mason finds himself with a client who has both intimate articles of clothing and other personal items inside the murdered man's secret apartment. She also had been drugged, as had her roommate; a drug that would have been fatal if her aunt hadn't gotten a doctor in time.Mason finds himself with a client facing a murder charge, and an attempted murder charge; the death of her supposed boy-friend, and the attempt on that of her roommate. But he does have one clue... the lipstick kiss placed on the decendant's forehead."
4,FUNNY AS HELL,LOVED el Chavo series since I can remember... Even Funnier as an adult! 1 thing about this dvd though...is they Repeat a couple sequences that are already on vol. 1 Why??
4,Divertido,"Es una copilacion divertida, pero la calidad de las copias y tal vez las grabaciones de estudio son de baja calidad (por si Ud se espera demasiado en cuanto a por ejemplo iluminacion o a imagen). Pero bueno, como viaje de regreso a la ni√±ez, algo es algo :-)"
1,No es lo que ustedes piensan,"Este DVD es una burla a los consumidores, son varios capitulos revueltos con un tiempo total de media hora, que horror!!!!Preferible seguir disfrutandolo en la tele hasta que televisa haga un producto del cual valga la pena comprar. Que pena........"
4,Robin Trower-Take What You Need,"I owned this on cassette when it first came out. My favorites are the songs: ""Take What You Need"" and ""Over You"".This album is a turn from what you expect to hear from Trower but if you're a fan you'll want this."
5,THE BEST OF THE LIVE,"There are certain live albums that must be owned. They are..1. KISS - ALIVE!Alive!2. QUEEN - KILLERS3. CHEAP TRICK - BUDOKAN4. THE KINKS - ONE FOR THE ROADThe order of these four are determined by which acts you perfer, but they all belong at or near the very top of the top of the list. ONE FOR THE ROAD was my introduction to THE KINKS when I was still but a teenager and it reamins for me one of the greatest live albums of all time. What determins a great live album? When the songs sound even better live than on the studio albums."
5,"The Kinks, forgotten greatness.",I still have never seen a greatest hits package from the Kinks that does them justice but until I do I will keep cranking through One For The Road.
5,This is the Kinks at their best,"Let me just tell you that if you have never heard of the Kinks, then you better go out and listen to this album.They are what truly (in my opinion) created the portal for rock.I know that may not be the case in other peoples' eyes, but trust me. You will find yourself listening to this album on those long boring trips, and before you know it you will be screaming ""Victoria"" or whistling ""Celluloid Heroes""A must have for ANY Kinks fan."
3,ARGGGGH! But it works,"If you are reading these reviews, you've already figured out this is difficult to assemble, but it nearly drove me to distraction! My husband finally finished the last few pieces. I broke three of them trying to put it together. It looks cool, and my shoes (7 1/2) fit fine with room to spare, even got two pair of loafers in one box. So even though it was probably the worst thing I've ever had to assemble except for a futon with missing bolts and chinglish instructions, it will do the job, looks pretty nice and doesn't look like it will fall apart. I believe there had to be a better way to design the clips, though, maybe they could have been metal? It is BIG, too, extra-wide due to the clips, so take care in measuring your space before you configure it-I need to take mine partially apart and make some adjustments. (arrrrghhh!) I wouldn't buy it again, but it will work now that's it's here."
4,Not just for shoes!,"It takes a little work to put this together, but the fact that I could arrange the cubes to fit a particular space made it worthwhile. I did end up with only 14 cubes with a couple pieces left over - you can only get 15 if you arrange it like the picture. But....... this is perfect for storing rolled up jeans! If you are some kind if neat freak who irons jeans, this is not for you. But if you smooth out the jeans, fold them in half lengthwise, and roll up gently from the bottom, you get the neatest little jeans package. I love it. I just wish I coud buy it in a smaller model."
2,Functional but very difficult to assemble,"I had bought one of these shoe cubbies a few years ago for my garage and wanted to get another one that matched. I had forgotten how much of a pain the first one was to assemble! It's like putting together a puzzle and if all the sides don't line up exactly, no way is the thing staying together. I would have thought after 4-5 years, they would have improved the assembly, but the second one was just as much of a hassle as the first. If you are looking for something quick and easy to put together, this is not the organizer for you. I will say, once it's together, it is very functional."
3,Frustrating to assemble!,"I only write reviews when I absolutely love or hate a product. However, this time I am writing one because I still have very sore and large red welts on the palms of my hands from trying to assemble this shoe cubby. It was very difficult and frustrating to completely insert the panels into the connectors so I had to use the floor and press down using my body weight because if you didn't fully snap the pieces in then the panels were slightly crooked or it would just fall apart. I'm just not sure it was worth the effort or the price."
1,DO NOT BUY!! Brakes before it's put together!!,This is a knock off and very poor quality. You are better off piling your shoes on the floor. The plastic fittings are not strong enough to receive the larger parts and brake when being fitted.
3,Great idea;not-so-great materials,"What an excellent idea! Unfortunately, brittle styrene plastic was used for the connectors. They worked just fine for the side and bottom pieces, but the slots for the back panels were too shallow. The panels tended to slip out during construction, and the connectors cracked or broke when trying to insert those back panels into lace. Patience and some super-glue required! But...the finished product has brought order to my closet."
1,Way too hard to put together,I attempted to assemble this once and it was way way too difficult. I bought it about a year ago and its now just sitting in the box :(
1,Never receive!,"I ordered this item for a month and they didnt ship it yet...there is no email or anything to let me know what's going on. I ordered from Amazon for more than 7 years, this is the first time that i never received an item,or they didnt even ship it yet...VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
1,"horrible, deceptive product","These were horrible. I should have minded the negative reviews. After an hour of frustration putting it together, gently tapping in the cheap plastic corners and watching them pop off across the room as I put a new piece on, I was really annoyed when I realized the cubies were way too small to fit my son's sneakers. Although I could have made each cube bigger by eliminating a slat, i would then only have storage for half as many sneakers as I had expected with the purchase. They say you get what you pay for, however in this case you get even less!"
2,Disappointed,"This is not a bad product at all, but I cannot assemble it because of arthritis in my hands. It is not user friendly in terms of assembly. I've wasted my money!Stanley H. CornwallP.O. Box 3749Westport, MA 02790508-636-5751e-mail: shcsr6@aol.com"
1,This is junk,"I've assembled many things over the years, and although I've been frustrated with some of those assemblies, I've prevailed in the end. Not so with this product. It comes with no instructions, so the pictures on the box have to suffice. It took me almost an hour to finally understand how, in theory, this piece was to be assembled. It took yet another hour of assembling one part only to have another portion fall apart, to realize that even if I managed to put this thing together, its falling apart while in use was inevitable. I've built additions to homes and know my way around tools, but I couldn't wait to print the return label and get this piece of junk out of my house. I know there are some positive reviews of this product; those reviews are what prompted me to buy this. For those of you who have had success with this, that's great. I'm just warning future buyers as to what they might be facing."
1,Shoes do not fit in the cubbies,"I have one of these already, just not this brand and not bought from Amazon.com, so I figured it would be the same thing that I already have. My other one my shoes fit inside the cubbies with room to spare...this one I put together a few and tried to put a pair of heels in, and they didn't fit. Also, I realized that the parts are very cheap compared to my other one. I automaticaly took it apart and sent it back. I would not recommend buying this to anyone, unless it's for kid shoes."
4,Shoe Cubby,Fits most of my shoes and fiance's shoes. He wears a size 13! I can put more than 1 pair of shoes in each one of the cubbies. Just beware your fingers will hurt after putting it together. I just moved so I had to assemble it twice! But it was easy to put away and was very easy to pack! Overall it is a great and stylish shoe holder :)
5,Back to buy more!,"We have had 2 of these units in our closet for 4 years now. They are sturdy, the cubbies are a good size to accommodate almost any shoe (non-boot) without wasting space, and they can be configured to maximize our oddly-shaped storage space. I needed something to organize other supplies, and this was the first thing I thought of. I hope they are back in stock soon!"
1,Too Small,"As another reviewer wrote, the cubbies are too small. In my case, I wanted to store women's sneakers and they wouldn't fit. Putting the cubbies together was also a major pain since you need to connect 4 sides and a back for each cubbie and, simultaneously, connect them to the adjacent cubbies. I'm returning the unit."
4,LOVE IT,Love this!!! I had no trouble putting this together. A rubber mallet does save your fingers. Sturdy. I love that I could configure it to fit my space and my shoes are no longer in boxes at the bottom of my closet!!!
1,Worthless,"This was worthless. Connectors broke easily, what was connected was shaky, and it all wound up in the trash. How I wish for the old corrugated cardboard shoebox organizers! Simple and durable. I still have mine from the 70's."
3,Looks ok but practical,"It took about 1 hour to assemble a 7 x 2 shoe organizer. It looked OK as it was kind of slanted. Some of the connectors and platforms were not the same size and at some point, it was difficult to snap the pieces together. However, I liked the fact that you can build it based on the amount of space you have - you can do 7x2, 5x3 or even 15x1. I was able to fit a pair of my wife's flip flops and flats (size 6) into each cubbyhole. But I had to use 2 cubbyholes for her sneakers. So it's not really 15 pairs you can fit. It depends on the size and bulkiness of your shoes. I would still recommend as it's a cheap space saver. I had 3 ""rows"" of shoes lying in my foyer! Now it looks clean."
4,15-Pair Shoe Cubby,"It surprised me, but this cubby is very sturdy. It does take some time to get together but it is worth it. After my hands started to hurt from pushing on the connectors, I came up with a good idea. I didn't have a small rubber mallat hammer, so I used a screwdriver with a dense rubber grip to tap the connectors all the way in. This worked great, but don't hit them too hard. Just tap them in until you see the slots are all the way to the hilt. It did take a couple of weeks for delivery, but it was worth it."
3,Like it only after assembly.,"I almost gave up on this when I had attempted to assemble using just my hands. When I went back and read some other reviews I realized that I was wasting my time and quickly found a mallet to assist in the assembly. It made all the difference. I did end up keeping the square back pieces off as I just couldn't seem to line them up properly. They seemed to be too small but I'm sure they would have fit if I was more patient. As it was, it took me an hour and a half to get together. Once I put the storage unit in place though and piled in the shoes it was all worth it. My kids shoes fit easily in one hole with extra room for another pair. My husband's size 11 shoes fit as well. The unit is sturdy once all assembled and it looks nice too. I give this 2 stars for assembly and 5 stars for the completed unit."
4,Great but not super large,"I have a similar storage system for my books and junk so I knew what kind of assembly I was getting into when I purchased it. It is a little time consuming and can get a little bit difficult at times but it is definitely worth it. Once assembled it is extremely stable and sturdy.Each shoe storage opening is about 6"" x 6"" as advertised. I wear a women's 10-11 and my husband wears a men's 10. I am able to fit my flats, smaller heels, flip flops, clogs, etc in the openings. The only shoes we have to split up and put only one shoe in each opening are our athletic running shoes. What I like about this organizer if that I can put two pairs of shoes in one bin (I do this with my flip flops and flats) and it will keeps it organized. It is much harder to double up with other organizers."
3,Works but...,"This product does what it needs to do...just hope you don't have big feet or want to stick boots inside. If so, you probably don't want this item..."
1,This sucks,While the colour is cute that's the only thing about this product that is. Assembly is HORRIBLE. The pegs to assemble the cubbies with DO NOT FIT!!!!!!!!!!!What should have taken 20 mins to put together took 1 hour and the product fell apart.SAVE YOUR MONEY
4,It was worth it....eventually....,"My biggest ""complaint"" about this product was the assembly. After an hour or more of trying my best I had to turn it over to my husband. He had it assembled within 30 minutes. The instructions are easy enough to follow, but the plastic bits just don't go together easily. My hands were bruised for a couple of days from trying to cram, and pound them into submission! But, like I said, my husband had little problem. I suppose his fingers and patience are stronger than mine.Once assembled, I was very happy. As for the sizing issue...the shoes don't fit in side by side, but both shoes do fit similarly to the way most shoes fit into a shoebox. You just have to turn them to fit. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
2,Shoe Cubby hard to put together,"The item is very difficult for me to put together. I try to put in one piece and then another piece falls out of place. I think the design and make of the item is great but I still have not finish putting it together. My hands aren't strong enough, meaning anyone with week hands or anything close will have a hard time."
1,Worst storage solution for shoes...,This shoe cubby shouldn't be that hard to assemble...but it is. Not only myself but 2 other people attempted to put this thing together and the little plastic holders that keep the shelves together pop off and the whole thing will collapse. Don't buy this shoe cubby!! I bought it based on the great reviews and was extremely disappointed.Don't buy!
1,No instructions!,"Although it is relatively simple to assemble in theory, it is very difficult to put together, even though I started with a rubber mallet like other reviewers suggested. I thought the assembly instructions would give some helpful hints, but there are none! I ordered two sets - both with no instructions, and none to be found on the web. Very, very frustrating - and I'm not bad at assembly!"
1,Do Not Buy,"Do not buy this item. It is difficult to put together. Each side needs to fastened with a disc shaped clip. That's 60 sides, 4 corners each. Apparently a toolkit is sold separately to make assembly easier. The item isn't sturdy either. The sides are made of thin plastic, similar to the material used for plastic folders. There are much better products on the market."
4,Great shoe storage,"This is the best system for organizing shoes. I bought this to get my shoes organized and it is great. However, I am glad that I wasn't planning on putting my husband's shoes in this too because they DO NOT fit. He wears size 10-11 and only one shoe would fit per cube. My shoes fit nicely though. Like the other reviews state, this is very time consuming to put together, but I feel like it was worth it. Once assembled, it is very sturdy. I liked that you can configure this how you want. It fits my space perfectly because I was able to build it the way I wanted."
2,Disappointed!,"Okay for smaller shoes, but the cubbies have gotten so small that you cannot fit a pair of size 7 women's tennis shoes in them! I had another one of these products from a couple years ago, and the cubbies are a few inches bigger and much more useful.This one is okay for heels or sandles but just beware that's about all you will get in these small cubbie holes!The product is a bit of a pain to put together, but once it's done, it's sturdy enough.Would be a better product if they would improve the size."
2,Don't expect a bargain,"This is definitely a lot smaller than I had anticipated! My 6 year old's shoes are the only ones that fit in each cubbie comfortably so for my husband's we used two sections without an attachment.The ""walls"" come out too easily, it's hard to click the pieces into place, and one of the pieces broke within a month of getting it."
4,Great for Custom Spaces,"My closet has some odd spaces that I wanted to utilize. This shoe cubby was perfect as I could change the shape to fit my spaces. The shoe slots are big enough that I could place my shoes in it with a toe and heal style showing. I gave it a 4 as it's a little challenging to put together but I used a little patience, a small tap hammer and a soft touch. Would definitely recommend because of its versatility"
2,"Product was very cheaply built, not worth the money","This is one of the few products I've bought from Amazon where I was disappointed with the quality. The product was very flimsy and cheap, and I ended up just reselling it on Craigslist. I would have returned it, but the shipping costs were so high (due to it's weight) that it just made more sense to sell it locally."
1,WAY TO SMALL for adults!!!,"I purchased 2 of these to organize my closets and what a mistake! First of all, they are a pain to put together. But after assembly I took them upstairs to start organizing my shoes. Big disappointment. The cubbies were way to small for my shoes. I wear a size 7 1/2 which is even below average and my shoes wouldn't fit. My husband's size 12 would have been a joke! So now I'm waiting for my 11 month old daughter to obtain 30 pairs of shoes because that is the only size that would fit into this crappy storage. DO NOT buy this product unless you have a ton of patience and size 5 or under shoes!!!"
1,Picture is deceiving - DO NOT Buy,"I bought this product a month ago and left it half way while assembling it. The actual product has very small compartments than it looks like in Picture. I can hardly fit small shoes in it. Totally useless for bigger size shoes.The picture is deceiving. I would suggest, DO NOT buy this one and save your money for something better."
2,VERY difficult to build but nice once built,"These seem like a great idea but when I opened the box and realized I'd have to build it I had second thoughts. Then I started and almost sent it back. I just finished a total remodeling of my kitchen and putting these together was the hardest and most frustrating I've ever been. Also I couldn't find any instructions until I was on the 3rd level and they appeared stuck on one of the pieces, even though I'd searched for them when I opened the box. The finished product works nice in the closet but the built is awful. They need to rethink the plastic pieces, perhaps use hard rubber that would give a little bit so they'd be easier to get on. If you're not handy or impatient, don't buy these."
4,Great solution to a problem!,"I have limited space for shoes in my closet and these customizable cubbies made it possible for me to use every spare inch of available space! They are durable and sturdy as well!! I ordered several sets and we were able to get enough of them under my hanging bars that I have put away all of my shoes, boot and purses and I can easily get them back out!!!! First time ever!My only issue with the cubbies is that they are tough to put together! Of course, that's what makes them sturdy....."
3,It's OK,The shoe cubby works just fine...once you get it together! It is difficult to put otgether and I never did figure out how to get the back pieces to stay in. I probably would not buy this again.
4,shoe cubbie,"Good size pockets. A little difficult to put together, but very functional once assembled. Like how you can make it any combination."
4,"Good Value, once you get it assembled","I am glad that I read the other reviews before I purchased, as the assembly of this product did take some time. I bought it to organize gloves, hats and scarfs in our entryway. It is perfect for the job. The assembly wasn't difficult to understand, but the connectors took some force to snap completely on. And you have to make sure they are completely on. I found that rotating the growing structure to give me the most leverage was helpful. But I know that it is sturdy and think it is worth some extra effort during assembly to have a product that is not going to fall apart. I just ordered another to add cubbies on to my first."
3,WAY Overpriced,"Pros:SUPER STURDYIf you buy multiple, you can connect them togetherCons:SUPER OVERPRICED1 Shoe per box, not 2 (unless you have small feet-that means 15 single shoes (not pairs of shoes)-Annoying to put together (but can be worth it)I would say... if you're rich go ahead and buy this. If you're looking to save money - but something else that will hold shoes. This was one expensive shoe holder (i got 2 - found 1 downstairs in the trashcan of the apartment complex I'm in). Overall - not worth $30"
3,Disappointing,"I returned this item because the dimensions weren't right for the space I had. It also took quite a while to assemble, even though I didn't finish assembling it when I realized I couldn't use it. It seemed sturdy enough, and cubby contents were visible."
4,Great versatile shoe storage solution but annoying to assemble,This customizable shoe cubby is very versatile so it was easy to make the bottom of the closet look clean and professionally organized. Simple yet annoying to assemble. I suggest a rubber mallet and some patience since there are connectors at every corner that you need to put multiple sheets into at the same time. It's easy to clean. Also fits most women's pairs of shoes into the same cubby.
2,Nightmare to assemble,"This ""thing"" is one of those ""great concept"" but ""simply doesn't cut it.""Although once it's assembled, you can fit small pairs of shoes in it (no boots, no snow shoes, etc.) - it's an absolute nightmare to assemble and once it's built, it falls apart at the slightest movement.The thing is held together by these little plastic ""tabs"" that hold grab onto the frosty plastic panels...Or well, in theory... that's what they are supposed to do. Once you try to put this item together, your hand gets bruised and battered as you have to pummel the tabs onto the wires. My wife broke several nails and I wound up with a right palm full of bruises.It's a cheap item, it holds shoes but if I could do it again, I would have spent my money on different shoe furniture."
5,My Kind of Blues as well,"I had read that this was B.B. Kings' favorite album. After hearing I can see why. I don't know what year this was produced, but from the cover photo it seems to be early in his career.Many of the songs are blues standards that have been covered by others, but in BB's hands, they sound like true blues songs.While the recording is may not be up to current standards, his voice is top notch. I have never heard it stronger. His guitar playing may not be the fastest or most complex, but it shows the solid BB King playing style with all his signature licks.If you are a fan, you need this. If you are interested in his music, or electric blues, this should be part of your collection."
3,"Nothing extraordinary, but a solid dub set","There is nothing groundbreaking or extraordinary about this post-9/11 set from dub don Scientist. It's just a solid collection of dub grooves.The album appears to be related to Sept. 11 in name only; the semi-controversial cover art (Bush in bed in his cowboy hat, Saddam poking out of his hole in the ground) is little more than an eye-catcher. Even the song ""911"" is just a paean to Rastafari, talking about 'birds in the trees,' and 'truer Rasta philosophy.' It's actually kind of a shame. The earthquaking potential of dub could have the ability to translate to an emotional reading of the events surrounding 9/11.Instead we get some decent dubby tunes."
5,Good quality,The book was slightly used but only had a few small markings on it from regular wear of being on a shelf for an extended period of time. Otherwise it is in almost-perfect shape!
3,A little misleading,"The first disc in this offering rates five stars for being an absolutely fantastic documentary. However, the second disc is about Admiral Nimitz and not about Pearl Harbor itself. Also, the bonus program offered is not ""Blunders Of Pearl Harbor"" but something about leaders of the Pacific theater, again, not about Pearl Harbor itself. I wanted a thorough documentary on Pearl Harbor, which I got on disc one. The second disc seems thrown in haphazardly. The item description, however, didn't mention the Nimitz material on the second disc and got the bonus program wrong entirely. I would've liked a more thorough, not to mention accurate, description before making my purchase."
3,War in the pacific,"A good documentary, but with all of the Pearl Harbor documentary material out there, why did the creators choose to include a documentary DVD on Chester Nimitz? This set should have been called ""War In The Pacific"" or something. But, the history is accurate and the footage is good. I would recommend this. It would have been great if they had one DVD about the attack, one dvd about Kimmell, and one DVD about Yamamoto. That would have made this collection stand out from the others! History Channel, ARE YOU READING THIS?"
4,Stinky but works!,"I bought this for my sons guinea pig. He had a bad itchy rash all over his body. I got the suggestion off a website. It cured ""Chewy's"" ringworm right away. It smells pretty bad though. But if you can handle a little skink then this product works."
3,Is it bad???,I just recieved it in the mail and it was leaking in the package and the lid would not close tight. i had to use a lid from an old bottle of childrens Ibuprofen. Now i have never had neem oil before so i need to know.....Is it bad if it has white stuff floating in it. Is it supposed to have little peices in there like that or is it supposed to be a only oil......
3,ticks/shampoo,Not effective on dog ticks..Seems to help in healing sores. Leaves dogs coat clean and shiny.
1,Horrible Smelling Poorly Packaged Product,"I have heard positive things about Neem oil, so I had high hopes for this product. I should have paid attention to the review about the bad smell. This product smells so bad it is virtually intolerable. I mean it really reeks. I can't see how anyone could actually use this on their animals. Further, when the product came, it was not even sealed. The bottle had SCOTCH TAPE wrapped carelessly around the top. THERE WAS NO SEAL INSIDE! I would strongly suggest someone wanting to use Neem oil try a different product."
1,Rotten bad odor-could not use,The package was hot when received so maybe the neem oil was rancid from the heat. I could not put that on my cats since it smelled like a cross between tar and something horribly rotten. Possibly it could be used outside as an odor deterrent if one has problems w/ wildlife destroying gardens.
2,Terrible smell,"Decided to use on my 20 year old ailing cat rather than subject him to toxic chemicals. Product smells worse than sulfur and did nothing to repel fleas. I used drops on my pet's skin around the neck, back and base of tail rather than mixing with shampoo so perhaps that made the difference. I also used a waterless shampoo that contained neem oil before applying the neem oil drops. After allowing the oil to absorb into the skin, I brushed the fur evenly to distribute throughout. The neem oil drops ended up matting my pet's fur. I eventually just ended up combing the flea out shortly after it had gotten fat from recently feeding on my pet after several days of finding even more flea dirt than before applying the product."
2,ONLY 2 OUNCES not 4 oz.,Buyer beware...only a 2 ounce bottle is currently being shipped.I received a 2 ounce bottle and called amazon. They were very understanding and overnighted a 4 ounce bottle and I was to use the shipping label they emailed to ship back the 2 ounce bottle. BUT once again I only received a 2 ounce bottle!!!I will call Amazon again to tell them they AGAIN only shipped a 2 oz. bottle...but expect to either spend a lot of wasted time dealing with this or that you are only going to get half of what you order and pay for.buyer beware
2,Not very useful,"Although I truly admire Robert Dilts and his approach to NLP, this book does not offer very interesting tools that you can use in your practice or classes, I am afraid. What a pity!"
5,What a great blast from the past...,"This is one of those DVD sets you but to watch this again because you like the series when it was on TV, its a show from the 1980's so most references are very dated, however if you loved this show when it was on the air it is great to be able to go back and watch this show again."
2,Why pay more for a bulkier version of the Collegiate?,"The Merriam-Webster's Deluxe Dictionary is identical to the Merriam-Webster 10th Collegiate, except it has been entirely re-typeset into three columns and color has been applied to all the original black-and-white illustrations. The result is very unimpressive. The book is a big bulky and heavy affair. It is cumbersome to carry and use. It costs ten dollars more than the Collegiate, and takes up more desk and shelf space. The illustration and type size seems the same as the Collegiate. I honestly cannot see any reason to recommend this format over the standard Collegiate. Like New Coke, this book is marketing's attempt to fill more store shelf space. Judging from its sales ranking displayed on Amazon, it seems the rest of the dictionary buying public concures. Save some money and get the superb Collegiate in the standard format."
2,Two-part shade,"The lamp base is as described, although the color of the wood is not as dark as in the picture. What really upset me about this lamp is that the shade. In addition to the fact that it comes in two pieces that snap together (as mentioned by another reviewer--and which I did not read before purchase), the trim is sloppy. The shade seems sturdy enough once snapped together, but looks cheaper than a $15 discount store shade."
3,Where did the drums go?,"A step back. I can't recall the last time I bought a cd that started out so weakly and then you get some gems near the end. Strange. ""The Gospel is Peace"" is excellent, but I think the production on this disc is underwhelming."
4,Pretty Fly (For Christian Music),"I usually don't get into Christian music but the songs are really pleasant to listen to, I especially like ""There Is Only You"" Have you seen the video? If you have, email me to tell me what the heck was going on..."
2,"Simple, Quiet and Slow",Although my son seems interested in this DVD right now I find that the graphics are very simple and cheap looking. I don't have too much hope that his interest will hold. Some of the animation is so strange I find it a little frightening and am hesitant to play it for my son. Also compared to other DVDs geared to babies and toddlers it is very quiet and slow.
1,Not Worth It,"This video is not worth buying. We have bought a lot of videos, and the So Smart series is the worst we have seen. A typical scene would be a big cartoon face with eyes that blink every few seconds. Our son loves videos, but walks away from this one every time. It is slow, unimaginative, low-quality, and not educational. Try instead the Baby Einstein series or Brainy Baby."
3,Not crazy about this one,"This product says it's for kids under 2 but it didn't last 2 minutes with my twin 18-month-olds. I think this is a better choice for infants who might need a little visual stimulization, but seems boring for toddlers."
2,"Too big, too bulky, too dull, slow do deploy...","It didn't come sharp. I, of course, understand that every knife needs eventual and regular sharpening, but this one came just dull. Yes, it is sturdy and quite heavy, but since it was dull, it doesn't really matter. I really can't imagine where and how one may use this knife. You can attach it to the pole and use it as a spear to kill a bear. Maybe you can use it strictly as a weapon against other human, I don't know. But to peel something, to cut something, to hack something-not really. Oh, you can use as a pry tool or a chisel. The blade is just ridiculously thick, its' angle resemble the angle of an ax."
2,Make sure you're in shape,"My wife bought me the Smith & Wesson SWAT knife several years ago and I was really pleased with it. The knife is quick and light and easy to handle. I bought this one thinking I would be getting something comparable...WRONG AGAIN. This knife had got to weight almost 3 times what my SWAT weights and, again, MADE IN CHINA written all over it. I don't know if these are knock-offs or if Smith & Wesson went cheap on me but I'm on to greener pastures. Maybe Gerber or Spyderco or Kershaw. A few more bucks but top in quality."
3,Nice Piece of Nostalgia,"A nice recap of the hey-day of international rallying. Lots of good footage of the Audi Quattro, Lancia Delta, Lancia Stratos and the Peugeot 205 T16. Also has some interesting information on the lesser-known road-racing Group B cars like the Ferrari 288 GTO."
3,Is Okay,I ordered this and the 30mm ball prisms. When they arrived they were both as described but I prefer the 30mm ball prism to the teardrop prisms.
3,Beautiful,"As an object, more beautiful than the 76mm Asfour Teardrop Crystal Prism. But the 76mm prism creates out better rainbows."
4,nice prismatic crystal,it splits the light nicely...if I have a 100 of these I could make an awesome chandelier! I think its cheaper that way too...
5,Very High Quality-- Comparable to Strass,"These crystals have exceptional clarity and reflection. The quality is comparable to Strass but at about half the cost. The design is simple and they emit beautiful colors and rainbows. The seller I chose, Davidson Lighting, is excellent. I have placed several orders with Davidson and each one arrived quickly and very carefully packaged to protect this very fragile item.If you are trying to restore an old chandelier, or simply replacing glass pendants on a light fixture, I highly recommend these prisms. I do not recommend them for hanging on car mirrors for safety reasons because the reflection can be distracting."
5,Bravo to Perl! A Great Way to Experience Beethoven,"Beethoven would no doubt approve of this fine collection of his thirty-two piano sonatas. Alfredo Perl gives passionate, thoughtful performances that rightly put the focus on Beethoven's music and not Perl himself. I especially enjoyed Perl's rendition of the Diabelli Variations, which is included on a bonus 10th disc; I found his interpretation of the variations to be one of the finest in recent memory. Moreover, at this price, this collection (over 12 hours of music) is hard to beat-- either as an introduction to the magic of Beethoven's piano sonatas, or as a fresh take for those already familiar with these seminal works. Bravo!"
1,What does this include?,"I really enjoyed the series. BUT, how can anyone rate a product that hasn't been released and doesn't tell you what you're getting? The advertised run time is only 180 minutes. That's 3 hours. I certainly hope it's a typo. if it includes all 4 seasons and the movies, then it's worth it. Otherwise, it's hard to tell what they will give you. Remember what they did to us for season 2 and season 4? I won't consider this product until they list what's really included. Besides, is it just me, or has the cost of Blu-Ray movies jumped up about $5 this past year (about 30%!)? Somebody is getting awfully greedy out there ... and corporate greed is why our economy is nearly collapsing."
2,ENDLESS EPISODES FOR ADOLESCENTS,Have not and will not purchase any boxed set of this 3rd rate attempt at science fiction entertainment.After viewing several episodes I am left with the desire to be again 13 and chewing bubblegum. I could then enjoy this embarassing waste of talent and time.
2,MIssing Disc,I just went through the entire box set and Razor was not in the box. There was a case that had the Razor cover but when I opened it there was only a season 4 disc and no Razor. When I went through the rest of the box set I found The Plan randomly sitting in a season 4 disc case but still no Razor disc.
2,So Bummed,I watched the first disc in the Season One box and was totally enraptured. However this quickly gave way to total exasperation as the final three chapters on the very first disc were all unwatchable - the picture froze and could not be advanced beyond the freeze except to load the next chapter. Augghhh! I have contacted Universal HD and am hoping I can replace the individual disc and not have to return the entire boxed set. I will post an update when/if I hear back from them.
1,Europe is cheaper,"Hello USA,in germany you get the whole series, all 4 Seasons, all webisodes, and all the following movies, like razor etc, in one complete box, for just 50 bucks, with english language too, it is just Region Code 2 , sorry"
3,"Great show, bad packaging!","I agree that the packaging on this boxset is bad, bad, bad! Really disappointing. The box looks cool, but it is designed very poorly. There is no episode list... so you don't know what episode is on each disc!And the holders for the individual discs are these bent cardboard pieces. It's really lame. Not easy to get the discs in and out of the set. I am really thinking about buying seperate cases to hold the discs since the cardboard sleeves suck so much. Universal should be ashamed. Considering how expensive this set is... I expect the cases to hold and PROTECT the discs. Even if the blu-ray discs have a protective coating... the case should not possibly cause scratches.I love the show, and the picture and sound quality on these discs are great! So in conslusion... I love the show, love what is on the discs, but hate the packaging."
5,"Great series, great set","Battlestar Galactica is one of the best shows of the last 20 years. I didnt care for the original, and as such I didnt bother watching this series when it first premiered. For years I kept hearing how good it was, and finally, shortly before the 4th season started, I netflixed the first three seasons. I was totally blown away. The show is very mature scifi, by mature I mean the intelligence of the writing, it doeant talk down to its audience. The production value is amazing, each episode is like a minimovie. The show also doesnt pull any punches, its not afraid to totally shake up its characters. This is not a ""more of the same"" each week kind of show. The series can be enjoyed by fans of scifi, or just good drama. Ive begun watching the series again with someone who cant sit through scifi, and shes hooked on BSG.The show looks amazing on bluray, it includes all 4 seasons, plus Razor and The Plan. I highly recommend the series."
5,Great series.,"Most folks looking at battlestar gallactica the series, already know what they are looking for. This is for those who haven't seen this yet. This show is barely like the 1970s original. Names are the same, but the storyline has been altered a bit. I recommend this show to anyone who enjoys sci fi. There are too many twists to mention, the writters keep you guessing. Plus, the end is a twist you never see coming. On my personal scale I give the show a 9 of 10. On a more generalized scale I think this could be an 8 of 10."
5,Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series [Blu-ray],"Love the series. The difference from the dvd is minimal because it was filmed with a grainy quality, still it is awesome... The quality does improve"
5,Battlestar Galactica blu-ray set,"The series is even better than I remembered - no comercials to cause you to miss the plot lines, 1080p video and dolby 5.1 surround sound. If you were a fan, this set will not disapoint you in any way. Every object and person is so very clear. I am seeing things I never saw when this was on TV in HD. Gotto go and watch the next disk!!"
5,Excellent Gift,My wife is a big Battlestar Galactia fan and is getting hours and hours of enjoyment from the collection. She especially likes the parts that have never been shown before.
5,excellent,"one of the best, simply a must have... it was great form the begining to the end. The quality was great too."
3,Packaging un-friendly,"While this is a collectors edition,it's not very easy to get the individual discs out of the sleeve,you end up with finger prints on them at best or scratched before viewing at worst."
3,Good product but some issues in the imbedded software,"Just know that the embedded BR program does not allow you to watch all episodes in a raw without expressly choosing this option so if you start watching form another episode than the first one on each disc, then you'll have to go back to the main menu each time you want to go to next episode. It doesn't comply with the feature that usually allows your player to memorize the last reading position so if you stop your BR player in the middle of an episode, you'll have to go through the disclaimers and federal warning messages (and the producer stupid message about this new edition) again and restart from the beginning the episode you were watching. Another thing : They put some extended versions of some episodes. But, for some odd reason, these extended versions are always on the next disc so you'll always find this out after watching the original version... this is really, completely stupid."
5,Excellent TV Series,"All the episodes including Razor and the Plan, more special features than you could watch in a weekend. Only con with this product is that it's now on sale for 116 from 149."
3,An Enduring Series that Deserved a Better Transfer to Blu-ray,"This gritty re-imagining of a 1970s space opera of the same name is one of the finest TV series of the decade and will likely continue to resonate. Unfortunately, the Blu-ray transfer in this boxed set doesn't do the show justice. Ninety percent of the footage is clear and crisp, but 10% spread throughout each episode contains flashing, sudden drop-outs of color, and equally sudden changes in contrast. The show is still wonderful and I will defend it with the tenacity of a hardened grunt from the flight deck. But as for the transfer... I had hoped that -- at least -- it would match the image-quality of the HD broadcasts on SciFi Channel. And it doesn't."
4,Fantastic set!,"The video and audio quality is excellent, and there are lots of interesting features. An excellent buy for the hard-core BSG fan. Even the Cylon figure looks great!My only beef is with the packaging. The outer box is fine, and it's really cool how the top lifts up to reveal each season on each side of the square. The problem is the box for each season. Each disc is in little cardboard slots, and its very difficult to get a specific disc out of there without getting fingerprints all over the disc. I'd suggest anyone who buys this set to take out the disc they are currently watching and put it in a separate jewel case, or something, to avoid having to keep going into the box.At any rate, once you get the discs out of the box, and into you're player, it wont matter. It's an excellent set!"
4,Stoopid box,"Love the series, love everything about the series. The acting, plot, action, myth, i can honestly say there wasn't an episode i didn't like. The only reason i gave this Product a 4/5 stars was the box. It's big, clunkey and takes up way too much space. Then there is the cases inside the box... ugh, the cardboard cases with flimsy dividers for the Blue-Ray Discs... makes me hesitant to pull/place the disc's within, scared I'm going to scratch them everytime."
3,Misrepresented,"I ordered the complete series and received the entire set, with only one shortcoming. Boxes of Season 1,2 & 4 were complete, but when it came to Season 3, I received two Discs of Disc 2, one each of 3, 4, 5 & 6 and no disc 1. Anyone have any idea how I can remedy this, since I paid over $120.00?. Let me know at KrisKlepan2@aol.com. Other than that, the discs were all in good shape and even played particulary well."
4,Collectible Cylon?,"I received this as a Christmas present last year. Beware of the 'collectible Cylon' as mine looked more like a Power Ranger and nothing like the Cylons in the old or new versions of the show (or the one depicted in this advertisement). I'd look for something else if the collectible item is the deciding factor in your decision. Who knows, someone may have wanted the Cylon only and regifted the item after the switch."
5,Package not so bad,I've been looking at this for a while now and finally got it when the price came down. I was worried about the packaging but it really isn't that bad. The disk fit a little snug into the box but the cardboard isn't going to scratch the disk. All blu-ray disk have extra hard coatings to prevent scratches. Thruogh May you can have the new packaging sent to you for free if you want.
3,"Great series, lousy packaging.","What a terrific show! The thinking person's science fiction, asking questions about what makes us human, what makes us conscious and spiritual beings, where we came from, and where we're going. Raises issues of militarism, species-ism, and religious diversity and tolerance.But what terrible packaging. The little cylon centurion toy does not make up for the fact that the individual discs are so hard to remove from their cascaded cardboard packaging that it is easy to damage one while trying to get it out. Putting them back is just as hard. Skip the toy and put the money into better casings."
1,Release the seasons on Blu-ray individually!,"I have not seen the entire series yet, but from the beginning miniseries I was hooked. I'd love to buy them by season, as how it was done on DVD. Why do the studios always lump everything into box sets on blu-ray? I don't want a fancy box set that I can't place in a slim storage center where my other blu-ray titles in traditional case fit perfectly. Please, somebody at Universal make a good decision and release them by season!"
4,Don't buy The Plan if you buy this set (BSG: complete Series B0036EH3U2),"This is not a posting about the quality of the set. It's about what's IN the set.Having read some of the reviews, I thought that this set did not have The Plan. Au contrare....it does have it, as I found when they both arrived in the same box. It's not listed in the Amazon listing but if you look carefully at one of the product pics, you'll see that The Plan is in the box. Guess I'll send mine back...and not get full reimbursement since this is a ""order error""."
2,"fantastic series, not worth the extra price for blu ray","Let me just say that I did not purchase the blu ray set myself, rather it was purchased as a gift for me (which I couldnt argue with). If you're thinking of buying this one on your own then think again...The series is fantastic, as anyone will tell you. However the blu ray edition is absolutely horrid. As most of the other reviewers have already noted the packaging is possibly the worst I have ever seen for any product I have ever encountered (especially disc based media).As far as the blu rays themselves are concerned, the High def is really not that impressive. The series was shot in high def but was intentionally made fuzzy and even blurry to achieve the look the producers wanted. The high definition transfer retains the original look and it literally doesnt add anything to view it in HD, and even may be a detriment.All in all save your money and buy the complete series on dvd, in the individual season box sets!!!!"
4,Battlestar Galactica collector set w/ Cylon,"Disc's are fine except for a mislabeing on one. My Cylon was a power ranger, not a cylon."
2,If this gets lowered in price I might bite.,This really should be 149.99When it hit's this price point I'll bite. Till then I suggest just keep waiting.Blu-ray in general needs to realize just because it's blu-ray you can't expect people to be okay with paying *that much more* DvD's sold because $14.99 is a impulse buy were has $24.99 is much less so. That and many people are re-purchasing movies that they already own in DvD and it's hard to justify upgrading in many cases.
2,Frak you Universal,"Best TV series released this decade, period. Like many others I too was late to this party as I tried to watch it when it originally aired but quickly got behind & lost. A friend loaned me her recordings and I quickly finished all 4 seasons. I enjoyed so much I wanted to own it for myself....Now in this time where people are exchanging videos on the internet you would think it would be in the distributors best interest to give the consumer a great product to keep them happy. This disc set proves the axiom wrong.If you haven't seen this series, WATCH IT. But, PLEASE, try to avoid this set; it is slap in the face to the consumer and a tea-bagging to the show's fans. Don't reward this offense.(5 stars for the show, 0 stars for this disc set)"
1,replace technobabble with religibabble,"Just finished watching all of BSG... what a let down. The finale basically made all of season 3 and 4 a useless and pointless waste of time.pros: some of the best acting I've ever seensome of the best space battles ever (new caprica escape!!!)cons: the religibabblethe story or lack of a story ratherthe finaleBSG left me with a ripped off/wasted my time feeling, although I would recommend watching/buying it, for the acting and space battle scenes, but know that anytime anything religious is said it is religibabble equal to the technobabble from star trek, just meaningless words strung together to give the impression of meaning, looks like Ronald D Moore didn't leave star trek all that far behind after all."
4,Non-stop drama until the end,"It took me about 3 weeks to finish watching this series. I'm glad I waited to get it all at once. Waiting 5 years would have been hard.I did not have trouble with the BD not working, but two of them locked up in the middle. After I reset my Panasonic player (only 4 months old and firmware current) it played okay. Not sure what happened with that.The very last movie, ""The Plan"", took the liberty of throwing in a few nude scenes, describing on the commentary that it was absolutely necessary for a realistic plot. I would have given it 5 stars without the nudity. Definitely not a kids show."
2,A review of the packaging only,"Tho artistically very attractive, functionally this is a disaster. The slots for the discs are very narrow and designed in a way that leads to scratches on the discs. There is no information on the individual episodes, nor are they indicated on the discs or anywhere in the packaging. I would recommend saving money and getting the individual seasons instead."
3,"5 Stars For The Series, 3 For the Horrible Packaging.","I am so glad that there are other people that agree the packaging on this box set is a sham. I was very very disappointed when I got the box set opened up and tried to get out the first DVD for viewing. I feel that there may be damage done to the DVDs over time with the way they have to be pulled out and put back in. $200+ is a lot of money to be throwing down on something like this and then have the DVDs damaged not due to misuse, but terrible packaging. The packaging should have looked like what this guy came up with on his own. Check it out: [...] I wish Universal would recall this series and give me a replacement with a better packaging system."
4,What a show!!!!!,"I am still working my way through the seasons and I have to say that this is such an engaging show. Even if you are not a sci- fi fan you will like this program. I believe this is more about religion and politics than it is space. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because season 2, disc1, episode 1 will not play. It freezes up for some reason, all other episodes on that disc play like they are supposed to. I hope that will be the only episode that has that problem, otherwise 5 stars all around!!!!!!"
5,Must-buy for fans...,This is one of my favorite shows ever. The picture & sound quality was amazing. Highly recommend to any fan of the show. Was definitely a step up from the DVD versions in terms of quality.
3,"Loved the Series, but this box set could have been better","I loved the Battlestar Galactica series, and I just couldn't wait to get the box set on Blue-ray, since I didn't have HD cable where I was living, and I wanted to see it all over again in its full glory. I wish I had waited for a less expensive box set to come out. This one was kind of cheesy and disappointing. The boxes containing the actual discs seem designed to scratch them, and I felt the need to be very careful extracting them. Also, a 'collector's edition' type of box set should be something you want to display, but I put this one on the back of the shelf behind other discs. The Cylon action figure was briefly amusing, but, really, plastic?! For this price I expect die cast metal. And, for this price I expected a better deal."
5,Blu-Ray Looks GREAT!,"I am very picky about image quality and I will say that this is a phenomenal looking series! I did see some of the ISO Noise in the Pilot disc and I understand this is noise from the LOW LIGHT taping. Other parts of the first series look sharp and incredibly detailed.I know this is HD because I can see the blemishes on the actors' faces! HD is almost too honest!Well worth picking up, if you missed the series, HD is beautiful! I will update this as I get through the series! ps make sure you watch the deleted scenes for the pilot!"
3,Package FAIL,Fantastic show but...Shouldn't the corners be cut off?No book of any sort? Poster? Episode guide?No exclusive behind-the-scenes disc?Just a doll?Not much savings over buying individual seasons.Wasted opportunity.
2,What the frack happened to the DTS-HD MA on Disc 2-3-4 on Season 1 ??,"Let's be quick :Package : 10/20 -> Do no keep it in your video roomStorage : 04/20 -> [...] : have to put all the disc into individual boxes. [...]Picture 1080p24 : 16/20 -> Can do better (beurk on season 1 disc 1 where the President meet the little girl on botanic ship, i thought i was viewing a VHS in my VCR that does no longer exist....)Sound : 13/20 -> That's the problem. What happend on discs 2 to 4 of season 1 because i can't play it on bistream on my 3 blu-ray player (Dune BD Prime, Samsung BD-P1400 ; LG CG20W on PC) I have to play it on PCM.... Anyone as the same problem ?Nevertheless Good show on BD !Jacques"
5,Missed the show,I missed the show now I can watch anytime. Ordering was easy arrived early and the blue ray quality is wonderfull.
1,Collectors don't want horrid packaging,"I don't know why the studios have such a hard time figuring this out. The Bluray set retails for $350, and for that, the DVDs come in flimsy cardboard packaging which didn't survive shipping intact. Each of the 4 set boxes had the cardboard bend/deform inside because they insufficiently support the weight of the DVDs themselves. The box design is OK, but I'd probably put it in a closet. Alas, the DVD boxes won't go well on a DVD shelf and as I said, their packaging was already damaged as soon as I opened the box.This isn't a shipping issue - it's clearly a horrible design from Universal. I'll be contacting Amazon for return or replacement, although really I just need new disc sleeves (which I'd love to be able to get from Universal)."
3,careful with non-Amazon vendors: not the same edition,"I emailed Electronica through the Amazon site to ask if the complete blu-ray was the 2010 edition (as the webpage would suggest) or the earlier 2009 version. They replied immediately that it was the earlier 2009 version. So while that vendor offers cheaper price, it's not the same product. Since so many people seemed dissatisfied with the earlier packaging and what was or was not included, I thought you'd want to know."
2,Lost in Space Revisited,"Sci-fi TV extraordinaire. Hands down the best TV special effects to date. Seasons 1,2,2.5,3 Knocked the socks off every science fiction fan in the universe. Awards, awards and more awards. BUT, then season 4. Sci-Fi became Dreamland Nonsense. What a WAIST! The creators didn't just drop the ball, they deflated it. The incredible anticipation leading to season 4 evaporated along with the storyline. The acting and special effects, still at a high level, became irrelevant. The plot and story line are so bad that it detracts from the continuity of the previous seasons. With the exception of ""Razor"", a real masterpiece of Sci-Fi television entertainment. This lack of effort from the writers, makes the purchase of this compilation a waist of money and time."
1,"Quote from the movie ""Cube""","""There is no conspiracy. Nobody is in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a master plan."" -- Cube"
1,Where's the eskimo?,"It is a pleasure to finally watch a science fiction series that is willing to portray the kind of future world I want. Here we have all the minorities represented and playing roles of consequence: the commander is Hispanic, the president is a woman (authoritative, too!), as is our crack fighter pilot (no pun intended); and, heck, you've got no shortage of blacks and Asians bringing up the rear. Pleasingly, the chief villain is a blonde -- that hussy!My problem, though, is that the series totally lacks an Eskimo! Although, as we all learn in school, the Inupiat of Alaska's Northwest Arctic have played a significant role in American history, an Eskimo character is nowhere to be seen in this film. What a pity. I really wonder how these filmmakers can consider themselves progressive in the face of such a troubling omission."
2,Galactic Soap Opera,"Space not the final frontier but the soap opera frontier. The old Battlestar Galactica was corny and bad acting; at least some people in the new BG are good actors (but definitely not most). But the writers are terrible, couldn't you have been more imaginative and not reused plots or themes from the original crummy series? Women in high heels and short tight skirts in space? A supposedly smart woman gets breast cancer because she never got mammograms? Not very smart and very soap operatic. She also wore high heels and short skirts; she was a really stupid person. Gimme a break. Lots of talk, over the top acting or really bad acting (like the woman who played Kara). The action scenes were repetitive, but then again when you're stuck on a group of crummy space ships and hardly land anywhere, there's little room for imagination."
2,Price is too high,"Yikes. Big, big fan of the series and was waiting for a complete release on Blu-Ray. With my birthday coming up I figured I'd throw this on my Amazon Wishlist but not at this price. Sure, somebody would buy it for me but I'd flinch knowing they'd spent way too much money. I'll wait and see if the price drops - maybe by Christmas. I'll still own the set someday but right now I just don't see enough 'value-add' in the set to justify the price."
5,A Sci-Fi Fan's Greatest Gift!,"Wow! I have been a fan of science fiction movies and tv shows since I was like 4 years old. Now that i'm older and I understand all of the behind-the-sences things that going into them I love them even more. When I first heard about BSG, I ignored it (being overly addicted to Stargate). But after my roommates got me to watch the mini-series I had to buy the first two seasons to catch up! Now, going back and getting to watch the whole awesome show from the beginning in Blu-ray, its like being a kid all over again. (Ok, I admit, I wouldn't have watched a show with so much frakking going on when I was 5, but who cares.)"
3,"A Question, not a review","I'm posing a question as a review and hopefully a hero will come along to answer it for the masses:Has anyone purchased this (FOR BLU-RAY) and can they attest to the picture and audio quality?I watched it on Sci-Fi (SyFy) HD and enjoyed it but I would say it was 720i, far from paying the extra money for the Blu-Ray version. I can save $100 and buy it for on DVD for my upconverting player but if it is a true 1080i or 720p version then, for me, it is worth the extra money to by the Blu-Ray version.___________________________________________________________________________Notes:I've watched the series, I like it. So I don't need your IMDb copy and paste.I'm looking at Blu-Ray. So I don't want your DVD review.I want to know hard facts about the disc. Not the box, not the action figure, not the price, not your opinion."
1,The Plan is not Included in the Complete Series set!,"We just purchased Battlestar Galactica, the ""Complete"" Series, or, rather, Battlestar Galactica, the Incomplete Series, because The Plan, which apparently comes out the end of October, is not included. No room in the guaranteed to scratch Blu-Ray case either, even if you purchase the new disc. I suppose, when The Plan does release, they will come out with the Battlestar Galactica, the More Complete Series for hundreds of dollars more. Fans want the series for the episodes, not for some idiotically-conceived package design. But thank you so much for the useless Cylon toy. What the frak!"
1,this is not the complete series....,There's still another minisode and a movie coming out... this is not the complete series by any means. Save your money and wait for xmas imo.
3,Lost it towards the end,"I bought all the series before seeing any of it earlier. The first and second seasons beats any previous Sci fi TV serie I have ever watched. Talking about Star treks; however starting the middle of the third season and up to the end of the fourth, the writers of the script were somehow lacking the right ideas and it became a mess.Glad I watched it however ""Star Trek Enterprise"" beats it by far."
4,Brother was very pleased with product.,I bought this complete series for my brother during Christmas this year. He was very pleased with the picture quality and overall product. He would recommend to anyone who enjoys anything sci-fi.
2,"DVDs Great, Packaging a Complete Disappointment","The two stars are for the DVD quality. Both the audio & video is great. BUT, and it's a big but, the packaging is horrendous.To start with, the box is so big it will not fit on any shelf in my home. The boxes that the individual seasons come in are flimsy and the folded cardboard that holds the DVDs came apart for two of the seasons. Getting individual DVDs out of the box is quite difficult unless you don't care about getting fingerprints all over the DVD. There is no documentation whatsoever. Not even a Episode guide. You have to load each DVD to see what is on it.And, as far as the Cylon figure, several joints don't move at all so it won't stand. I guess mine is a dead Cylon.I wish I had simply paid a little extra to get the individual seasons so the DVDs would be protected and I would be able to find the episode I want to see."
5,Worth the wait!,"I'm taking my time watching each eposide and will revisit them every year. I was worried they would rehash the same old versions. Thank you for not using Boxie and that stupid electronic dog. That's when the old eposide jumped the shark for me. The new series kept it fresh and I enjoyed the director's podcasts explaining the situations behind the scenes. Thanks for the series, it's a keeper."
3,Great series awefull package,"Awesome series. This is not a review or the video quality of the series or the series itself. Good video quality but the packaging is like from the 70s. No episode list, what's this, a guessing game? The box and the robot are nice additions but the boxes for the seasons are really crappy. Discs can get scratched really easy, they are only protected by a slim cardboard layer. They aren't even held in place by a plastic holder. All in all I would recommend buying each season separately."
5,the best ever,"the universe of Battlestar is the most interesting... The Cylons, Twelve Colonies and Greek mythology as a base of beliefs... great minds did it ! Thank you so much for so much time ""wasted"" for this !!!"
3,Ehhh.,"I think the cases were not designed very well. It's a big pain to take dvds out or put them back in. The worst part is that it didn't seem to come with any kind of episode guide, so you don't which episodes or special features are on which disc. Although, I must say, I enjoy the little centurion action figure."
2,"Great, but for the technical problems....","This could be the greatest blu-ray set ever, but in around 20% of the episodes the audio is out of sync. On such an expensive collection, this is unacceptable. Furthermore, having ordered this from Brazil, i suppose a retun is out of the question. But I have to say, the image is cristal clear and the sound terrific otherwise."
1,BluRay Disk do not play,"I finally got to season 4 and what happens the season 4 bluray disk do not play. Season 1, 2 and 3 did fine but none of the season 4 disk played. I looked at the disk and did not see any marks on them. Since this is such a big collection it took me longer than the return period to get to this point."
5,Loved this boxed set,I missed this series when it first came on television. The complete set is the way to rectify that mistake. It has everything you'd want if science fiction is your thing. My family and I loved it.Don't buy extra DVDs for related features until you examine the contents carefully. I found this set already contains additional material I had intended to buy.
3,"""the plan"" IS included!","""the plan"" is inside SEASON 4.0 Disc 4.(i bought the gray box: ""BSG the complete series"")mine happened to have a distorted face, with the colors bleeding all over the ""battlestar galactica"" heading, but it played normally.it would've been nice for ""the plan"" to have had its own jewel case, though, since there is clearly room for it in the boxed set."
1,Set is missing seasons/gives you 2 of one season,"The 1 star is NOT because I don't like BSG. No way. The 1 star is because I ordered this product while it was on sale, specially through Amazon, for $130. Quite the deal right. I don't know if it was just my particular product or what (and I would venture to say no since there's a message up on the product page right now saying it's under review and not sold by Amazon right now due to complaints) but my set is missing season 3 and instead I have a second copy of season 2. PISSED!!"
4,"I love this series, but it's not worth 130.00 for 4 seasons.","Who the hell do these ppl think they are charging 130 for 4 season. I'm sorry but even when friends/scrubs/SG-1 came out at 10 seasons I don't think they were this expensive.Anyway that being said, great series, good action, great drama, it's not a 5 but damn close. Acting was very good, plot was kind of the same line as the original series, but they tweaked it a lot with the cyclons it wasn't just about the humans.I thought they did a pretty good job with the remake."
3,missing data in the descriptions,"the special features 'read more' button doesn't do anything so I can only read about the first few discs.in the editorial reviews seasons one, two two.5, three, and four.5 have descriptions but season four.0 is missing.I checked other dvd collection versions and the same things occur on those pages.I'd get the impression I would be missing the 1st half of the fourth season if i buy this, so fix it, Amazon."
4,Good review of moving averages,"For me, the book reminded me of the importance of paying attention to moving averages and changing from the standard 50 dma to others both shorter and longer. Also, the descriptions of price dips below a moving average that just started upwards is worth viewing. Like the prior poster said, he is new to this."
1,Found it worth the time and money,"Here are some of the topics it delivered on: Traders of every level will also discover how to:-Calculate moving averages--including the Simple, Variable, and Exponential-Use moving averages to identify price cycle bottoms-Identify support and resistance levels with moving averages-Spot trend changes with moving averages."
2,Disappointing treatment of a great topic,"I agree with the author on the importance of moving averages being included in some way in every trading system, but the book does not present a clear use of moving averages. The problem may be that the author assumes the reader will understand the point he is trying to make with out much elaboration or that the fuzzy charts in the book will speak for themselves. Unfortunetly for me they did not. I received very little value for this book's steep price. You would do much better buying any of Dr. Alexander Elder's books or Stan Weinstein's book. This book is like a Cliff's notes on using moving averages, being little more than a compilation of notes from other books. By all means use moving averages to buy on pullbacks, but unless this is your very first book on stock trading I doubt you wll find very much value here."
2,NOT BAD,"I SEEN FAR WORSE MOVIES THAN THIS. I LIKED IT! I THOUGHT IT WAS ENTERTAINING. BETTER THAN A LOT OF THIS GARBAGE THERE MAKING NOW! HELLO!!!! I HOPE THEY DON'T MAKE A REMAKE OF THIS ONE. OMG... I THOUGHT I SEEN A PIC OR A POSTER SOMEWHERE WHERE THERE ""REMAKING"" THE MOVIE ""THE THING"", AGAIN. THIS WILL BE THE 3RD TIME. I HOPE IM WRONG."
3,Looks nice but...,"The earrings look nice, but my set came without 1 backing. I tried e-mailing them but no response. So I had to go to Walmart to buy new backings.This experience tells me I need to shop for jewelry in person instead of on the internet."
4,Best of the Metal Years!,"The vocals on this album are amazing. This album is not quite Heavy Metal but Rocks hard and heavy without some sloppy power ballad to slow it down. A serious reunion is needed, these guys could go over well now. They were a well overlooked band that had monster talent. Rock On!!"
3,Great album,If you like music that gets you moving this the album for you! Every song is worth a listen.Lots of bands have those kick ass first albums and this is one of them! Quickly they went down hill and you'll see other albums used for outragess prices so if you haven't heard this one don't try others! This is the one that will tell you if you should even try others!
4,great to follow,This book was easy to read and easy to follow. I am now down 15 lbs in one month following this diet
1,Lasted 1 year,"I have to replace it again; it only lasted just about a year. AC-Delco is usually a quality product, but I guess that depends on where it's made. I bought it from my local auto parts store and I recall that it was made in China, but didn't think much since AC-Delco is a quality product. This time I'll pay attention to where it's manufactured rather than the name. The price of the pump is not that much, but it's the trouble of replacing it again and of course you'll need new coolant again."
1,fast shipping great price,Great deal from Amazon. Just a little upset something from a US company like AC Delco and the water pump is not made here. Thanks again Amazon. Best deal on the internet.
2,Good for Costumes; Staging,"As a film, it's a weak jumble of poor directing, and I feel bad for the actors, many of whom gave earnest performances, but bad directing can make even the best look foolish. WHERE THIS FILM SHINES, is the costuming and the construction details of the trenches and bunkers. If you're in the theatre and you are dealing with a period piece, watch this for the uniforms and the sets."
1,A movie to skip,"As an Avid Military movie fan I've got to say, this movie ranges at the very bottom of a long list of stinkers. The time spent digging the ditch to film this loser in was totally wasted. I'm sure Daniel Craig isn't too damn proud to have his name tied to this movie. Actually Daniel really didn't do a very good job here as an actor. The direction is half-ass and weak. The edit must have taken a weekend at least. All together, the WORSE WAR MOVIE I have ever seen, and I have seen most available. Save your money and go out for a Pizza. Money better spent."
4,The Trench,"This is an excellent movie for World War I buffs. Why? For one reason, there is little enough out there for the amateur historian of this period, and the depictions and language exchange are useful to understand trench warfare. This is not about character development to the ultimate degree. This is about a snapshot of history, and it is well done, for what it set out to achieve. And the price is right. Buy it, now.Several things are lacking, like the dry trenches (never happen) and the clean uniforms (Britain had been in the war for two years), but perfection would make it five stars, rather than four.Jim Minnoch"
3,The trench-- nothing else?,I enjoyed this flick because I love anything WW1 but you can tell that the budge was restrictive because almost evvery shot was in a trench! One the plus sife it explores the personality of the guys getting ready to go over the top one 7-1-16 the ffirst day and the sad day of the battle of the Somme....any who says Hague was not a dope! Not the best but a must see for the WW1 buff.
4,The Trench,Another addition to my collection and another depiction of what trench warfare must of been like!
3,TRENCH,"Daniel Craig gives another great performance in this historical drama. I found the cockney accents a little difficult to understand at times, but all the young actors are strong in showing their naievete and being scared in war. Theres a doom that hangs over the story that you just know things are not going to turn out well. And then one bad thing happens after the other....But a soldier does what he must do. Very heartbreaking.I also enjoyed the history lesson as I was not familiar with this episode of British war time."
1,Good sleeping pill,The text is unnecessarily lengthy and should not be even used as reference for an introductory course.
4,Review by an Electrical Engineering Major,"This product is very insightful with regards to communications systems. Some of the notation take some time to get used to, but beyond that, Carlson, et al, does a good job explaining the many facets of electrical communications and the analysis thereof. Warning: this book should only be purchased by those individuals who have a strong background in electrical circuitry and mathematics as the content of the book relies on a prior knowledge of these subjects. However, for those select few who are electrical engineering majors, please think about purchasing this text book."
3,Just OK.,"This book is good for one who is locking for a mathematically extensive explanation of analog communication systems and basic digital systems. It lacks of real world applications and practical examples.I purchased the Forth Edition becuase my graduated-school teacher followed that edition for the class, but I had the chance to compare it to the Fifth Edition and it did not include major changes and up-to-date information yet... Still old staft with few to nothing real-world applications and examples.It also could be a good textbook for EE students without any knowledge in telecom systems, but not for those who already know the basis."
4,Very Good Underrated Album,"I've listened to this album a lot over the last couple of years and I personally think it's better than the first. I enjoy all the songs except maybe Time Ain't Runnin' Out.A couple of the songs could have been recorded with a little more oomph, listen to Separate on this album and its OK, listen to the live version on Loaded Deck and its brilliant. Juvenile Delinquent is also a little slow, when they played it live at the Limelight Club at the start of the second tour it really rocked.The best song on the album I would say is It's Over Now, which is a great ballad. Insane is a great tune too.Definitely buy this is you're a fan of Ace, just don't expect hard rock."
4,Ace Frehley's second solo cd,"This cd has got mixed reviews in the past for good reason. I've found that with the second & following listenings I liked it more & more. I would recommend you get the original 1988 release if you want the full artwork, the 98 & 09 versions only have parts of it. I can give this cd a B- or B rating."
4,Second Time's a Charm for Ace!,"As a devoted KISS fan this album is second only to Ace's first solo album in my book. Every riff and solo is memorable with the classic Frehley guitar tricks I felt were missing on the first Frehley's Comet album. From ""Insane"" to ""Juvenile Delinquent"" to the trade-off lyrics of ""Loser In A Fight"" this album never stops rockin'. Todd Howarth captures the feel of the 80's glam rock bands in his songs like ""Fallen Angel"" and ""Time Aint' Runnin'Out"" which really rounds out the album. Also, the density of sound on ""Second Sighting"" surpasses the first Frehley's Comet album by far. If you love Ace, add this to your collection."
3,Howarth bails out a weak record,"I'm a Frehley nut from a long time back, but this is pretty weak stuff. While the guitars are phenomenal, as per usual, Ace's songwriting seems to have taken a severe nosedive. His best track, ""Insane"", is the first song, and it's up to Tod Howarth to save the rest of the record. And he does his best. ""Fallen Angel,"" is great, and ""It's Over Now"" fills in nicely as the required-by-law power ballad. Too bad the band died after Trouble Walkin'."
3,"Todd Haworth, the talent behind Ace","This album contains a ""few gems"" as the previous rating stated, all of which were sung by Todd Haworth. Unfortunately, finding material from Todd is nearly impossible. Talent gone to waste. Check out the ""It's Over Now"" track. Brilliance from the first mate on Frehley's comet."
1,Tried on dog-didn't work,"This product said it could be used on dogs, as well as other animals. I tried this for my dog who chews on cords. I sprayed a brush he likes to chew liberally with this product and left it out for him. He immediately started chewing on it like always. I sprayed the brush again with the same result. Didn't work for my dog."
2,It IS Bitter...,"It is bitter. After spraying it, even very sparingly, the smell and taste hung in the air, permeating... everything.Our puppy wasn't a fan of it. For about... five seconds. And then he ignored it. I gave it two stars because it's bitter, and because it might be that our dog is just impervious... but it didn't work."
1,This product did not work at all!,"We purchased this product so that our cat would not continue licking some spots on her fur. We sprayed quite a bit just to be sure that it would work. Within a matter of a half hour, so licked it all off, and it did not deter her whatsoever. I would not recommend this product."
2,I expect more for this price.,"Pros:-Pockets for everything - file dividers, padded laptop pocket, pens, business cards, keys, etc.-Expandable for use as overnight or carry-on bag.-Beautiful, professional looking leather.Cons:-Wimpy - The leather on this is more like a fancy purse than a briefcase; it's too sensitive to abrasion. I got a small rip in it the first week catching it on an office chair.-Bulky - Even if you carry more than average to/from the office, this bag is too bulky. The padding and several pockets and dividers add too much space.-No bottom reinforcement - For a bag that can hold so much and be used as a carry-on, it needs extra protection on the bottom for setting on the ground. I'm afraid to set this on pavement because of the sensitive leather."
5,Truly a great tool...,This is a very easy read and GREAT book for explaining and lining out the roots to helping your children be happy within themselves and tips on how to help navigate them through life. This book is extremely helpful in explaining the reason for many of the beahaviors we see in our children but don't understand. The tools in this guide help identify particular traits and behaviors and how to steer these behaviors to a better chance for lifelong tools for creating happy kids! ...and adults! I very good book to add to your parenting library!
5,The Childhood Roots of Adult Happiness:,"Dr. Hallowell has done it again; this is truly an outstanding book both for the professional clinician as well as parents. I have been a senior clinician for over 30 years and am recommending it to all my patients as well as to our residents in family medicine and psychiatry! Dr. Hallowell continues to show an unbelievable depth in his understanding and empathy in the nature of human emotional well being; how it can be achieved, nurtured and sustained! Everyone in the family can share in what this book offers. What a great way to spend quality family time together!Thank you Dr. Hallowell!"
5,A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST WHO TRULY KNOWS &LOVES CHILDREN,"IN THIS DAY AND AGE, WE ALL NEED REGROUNDING - WE LIVE IN A TROUBLED TIME AND BRINGING UP CHILDREN IS OUR MOST IMPORTANT JOB.BUT....WE HAVE NO TRAINING - WE LEARN ON THE JOB - WE MAKE MISTAKES - WE HAVE SUCCESS AND NOW WE HAVE DR. HALLOWELL TO HELP US NAVIGATE.AS ONE OF THE MANY SINGLE MOMS, I THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL BOOK FILLED WITH INSIGHT AND THOUGHTFUL GUIDENCE. I WILL PASS A COPY ALONG TO MY CHILDREN WHEN THE TIME COMES.NANCY OGDENPRODUCER, Attention Deficit Disorder in the 21st Century,A Conversation with Edward M. HallowellA video series for parents, kids & Teachers"
5,Recommended for Anyone with Children,"This is an excellent book, which shows that in childhood you plant the seeds for adult happiness. It gives concrete suggestions about what to do for your children in order to improve their odds of becoming happy adults.A few things struck me in particular: the idea of flow, that we are happiest when we are in activities that we get so wrapped up in that we forget ourselves, the concept that children need to learn how to fail, and how to cope with failure, that being bored is an opportunity, you needn't fill up every minute of your child's time, or orchestrate their play.I'd recommend it to anyone with children, or anyone, such as teachers, that deal with children. Even an unhappy adult, might find out that they have the seeds of happiness within them, they just need some care to make them grow."
5,Great for travelling,"These are handy for travelling. It keeps your clothes organized and when you get to a hotel, you can just put the cube in the chest of drawers and when ready to repack, put the cube back in your suitcase....quick unpacking and repacking and keeps everything organized."
1,Would be a nice item but smells like gasoline,"Pros - Seems to be well built and fold to a compact size. They are just the right size for carryon luggagecons - STRONG smell, like gasoline. Hopefully airing them outside will remove this smell. definately not usable out of the bag. If not they will be returned. Airing them out did no good.I returned the item to Altman Luggage and was issued a refund. So I'm out the return postage and nothing to show."
4,Good bargain.,Price is right and the product is well made. Helped me keep things organized during a very long international trip and I also use them around the house.
4,Pretty much what I expected,"Being entirely made of mesh, these provide excellent air flow and keep clothes from getting stale. They are deeper than others I have used, and I think that is going to be a plus."
5,Awesome product,These cubes work awesome with the Rick Steeves convertible carry on. I haven't checked a bag while flying since buying the bag and these packing cubes. I highly recommend for non-business trips or for which you don't have a suit that is dry clean only.
4,Solid but stinky,"Does what it's supposed to. Makes packing and navigating bag searches at the airport easier.Did take a while for the stink of plastic to waer off. I gave them regular baths in Febreeze. The smell did pass to my clothes. Again, a travel bottle of Febreeze solved the problem."
1,Not recommended,When I first received these I thought they would be great because they are a little more spacious than most other brands. After using them I would not recommend buying these packing cubes. My clothing stuck to the solid surface and it transferred black color to my light colored clothing ruining them. The black would not wash out.
2,Smells horrible,Bought these for a trip and while the design was nice the Cubes all had a very strong chemical/petroleum smell which I assume is from the material used in manufacturing. Let them air out for a week and they still stink and will be returned to Amazon. There is no way I would pack my vacation clothes in these.
5,Great Product! A must have,These travel cubes are genius! Anything with Rick Steve's name on it is good quality and a must have. These are super light weight and practically collapse down to nothing. They also fit great in my Rick Steve's convertible carry-on bag that I own. There's lots of packing cubes on the market but you can never go wrong with Rick Steve's.
5,Essential,"Absolutely essential for those long vacations or when you share a suitcase with your significant other. Keeps everything in it's place. When you put your shirts in one, they don't shift around and this helps minimize the wrinkles."
1,USED ONCE..Ready for the garbage,"Mesh ripped apart upon first use. We've used our Eagle Creek packing cubes since 2003, when we took them on our backpacking trip through Spain and Portugal, then all over the U.S. over the past 9 years, and not one piece of mesh has ripped on the Eagle Creek cubes. These are inferior and I would return them, except the time to return has elapsed.I would NOT recommend these cubes to anyone for any purpose."
3,Disappointing,"Love the concept and do use them for ""containing"" groups of clothing, but the seams came apart almost immediately on one cube, which makes me hesitant to use the others. Expected excellent quality with Rick Steves name on it."
3,Prefer Eagle Creek packing cubes,"After many years of using the Eagle Creek packing cubes, I decided to give the Rick Steves cubes a try. While they are definitely larger than the EC ones, with better visibility into the interior contents, I feel that they are a bit too unstructured and ""floppy"" -- they don't seem to work quite as well when not full, and non-clothes items seem to get stuck more easily in the mesh. Your mileage may vary but I'll stick to using the EC ones much more frequently."
5,helps much more than expected,"These packing cubes or zip-bags have made a much bigger difference in my travel packing than expected. When I travel, keeping track of where I put which item becomes impossible. Who has time to keep the suitcase in order over a week of on-the-go travel? There's so much more fun and important stuff going on!So, I've found that being able to think: okay, all the big clothes are in this bag, the smaller ones in this bag, and my extra little things that usually end up rattling around in the bottom of the suitcase where I can't see them are all in the smaller cube (e.g., hairbrush, travel alarm, phone charger, camera charger). Sometimes I wish the cubes weren't black, because this makes contrast bad in dim light, but black has its pluses too."
4,Neat and Organized Packing,"I had never even heard of packing cubes until I started looking for luggage for an upcoming trip. I think they will help make things much easier and neater. The mesh lets you see what is inside and the colour coded zipper pulls makes it easier at a quick glance,"
2,"OK, but there's better","The stitching is very cheap, the zippers snag easily and the mesh ripped on my first trip. By contrast, on the same trip, my Kiva packing cubes held up wonderfully. That is why I downgraded to two stars. The direct comparison."
5,A blessing for any traveler,"This product really helped my husband and I on our latest trip to 3 countries. We didnt bring many clothes, but we could keep them organized in the kits. We knew which clothes were clean and that we could squish them in our suitcase easily to make room for souvenirs. Highly recommended and they even ship free!"
2,"I prefer ebags cubes, the zipper on Steves Cube get stuck","I bought both the Rick Steves Cubes and the ebags cubes, and although both are good to keep your luggage organize, the zippers on Rick Steves Cubes get stuck all the time. The ebags are much better quality, easier to use and their sizes are much better. The small size of the Steves cube are not good for clothes, there are too small. It is worth to pay a little more and buy the ebags cube."
3,Rick Steves Packing Cubes,"These are the lightest weight cubes I have found, and they hold more than other cubes because of the netting on all sides and the top. I have another set of these cubes and they work perfectly, but this set has zippers are sticky and hard to operate. I hope they will loosen up with use, because I love cubes, they make packing so easy!"
4,A real asset to your RS bag!,"I recently used these to pack for my honeymoon to use with my RS suitcase/bag, I enjoyed the structure they provided to the softsided luggage! I was really able to pack a lot and have it compressed into convenient cubes for travel; at the airport it was easy to open my bag and have them check my stuff, tidy and swift through security.I would recommend two sets per RS bag if you want everything in these travel cubes. One set let you lay down a full base layer and then I was able to add larger folded items on top so it was still great, but I would have liked having 2 sets.Each cube has two zipper pulls so you can get at the contents easily. The material is vented with a bit of stretch, so it is nice to overpack a little and then zip it all down -- like a packing girddle :)Highly recommend!"
5,Good quality!,"I am thoroughly satisfied with this product. These should last quite a long time. Rick Steves makes awesome travel shows, books, and products. Long live Rick Steves!"
3,For the Student Only,"This book form the otherwise excellent Great Philosophers Series suffers from being inaccessible or uninteresting to anyone who was not already well acquainted with his writing. I was looking forward to reading about Locke's contractarian philosophy and its influence on the founding of the United States, but alas this was nowhere to be found. Even I, who has read evey book in this series, had a tough time ploughing through this entry."
3,I can't agree with everyone,"Yeah, this sounds great, yeah this is classic live Ted with Derek St Holmes but in this day and age of remastering an expanded set would be welcomed. The sound will blow you away, as if it didn't the first time around listening to D.L.G., but this time it's even more sonic assualt on this mind, but no extra songs ?!?! C'mon, the first time around missed classics like Free For All, Dog Eat Dog, and even Hey Baby, in fact Ted's entire Free For All is not even represented on this. A bummer initally and a bummer 30 years later. If I could make a recommendation, pick up Ted Live at Hammersmith 1979, it's a much more gonzo affair than this."
5,Like hearing it for the first time 33 years later!,"Double Live Gonzo sounds as I said ,Like hearing it for the first time! Remastered finally! Sounds like your there an Teds runnin around with the coon tail hangin again !Real improvement compaired to the original cd quality!"
4,solid latin grooves from the late 70s,"every song is great, but the track ""hey girl"" is remastered awfully! It sounds like someone remastered it off audacity or something."
5,Nice Pool Cleaner : ),"Look, folks, I've tried the good, bad, and the ugly when it comes to pool cleaners: the Baracuda, Hayward, Kreepy Krauly, and now the Polaris.So let me tell you---this pool cleaner is a good buy. It's quiet, effective, and reliable (unlike the Kreepy Krauly).It's actually relaxing to watch this little guy work as he silently rolls around your pool. He minds his own business and does his job (unlike the Kreepy Krauly that is loud and always gets stuck on the steps).I should warn you that this machine isn't fast, and I have caught him taking a break now and then, but overall it does a great job and keeps my pool clean."
5,La Pavoni PSC-16 Stradavari Espresso Machine,"Great purchase! As advertised, took some experimentation to make passable espresso and cappuccinos. On-line YouTube videos (varied selection readily available) huge help in showing what the process looked like, what steps to take and what the variables were. Learning curve fairly steep; passable product wthin six tries. Still learning, but truly enjoying great drinks in the process!It's important to get the full package for ease of preparation and process control. This includes burr grinder, 53mm tamper (I bought the wrong size initially and the plastic one La Pavoni sends is junk) frothing pitcher and thermometer. Haven't used the La Pavoni frothing attachment. Looks like an unnecessary device that would need a lot of cleanup.Overall, the product is very easy to use and maintain. I really like being able to vary the flavor of my drinks by conscious choice. As the process has evolved, my wife has changed from skeptic to a huge fan!"
3,Squier,The remastering of this DVD was done well. Overall sound quality is crisp. High & vocals are much like being at his concert very high & peircing. Video is all that can be expected of camera quality & stage lighting of the early 80's. If you have a library of similar vidoes then you know what I'm talking about. If you have mostly newer 90's to current DVD concerts & are taking a trip down memory lane then you may be disappointed in the quality of this concert.
3,Humor examples,"This book was a nice overview of creating humor--the varied examples of humor and the ways it could be used were the best.The book was rather optimistic that we all could ""create"" good humor after reading this book. Gave some good insights, but hard to write a ""how to be funny"" book. Still, a worthy try. Did not come close to exploring theories of humor or where it comes from, but the book did not set out to do this."
3,"Sorry, but I got bored",I found some funny material in this but mostly I got bored and eventually ended up scanning the second half or so of the book. I was looking for something like an Idiot's Guide or Dummies Guide to being funny and this isn't it. A lot of the material just didn't seem funny to me. Maybe I just didn't get it!
5,Great Series,Transformers: The Complete Series is money well spent. I enjoyed watching the series with my children years ago. Now I enjoy watching it with my grandchildren. Anyone who enjoys older cartoon will love this complete series.
4,Awesome but lacking,"First of all let me say I am very happy to have got this. One of the best DVD box sets I own. I got it on sale at walmart.com about 2 years ago. This is a great show for those of us who are die hard transformers fans. However, the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it dosen't include the first animated movie. It would have been a good idea to do so because if you haven't seen it there is a huge story gap in between the first few and last few seasons. It is probably a good idea to buy it with this for that reason. Unless you know what happens in that gap you will be very confused like I was. I am not saying don't buy this just that you should be ready for some research if you do."
2,Missing Episode,"I was watching the final episodes of the set and kept wondering why I had not see the first return of Optimus Prime. I looked in the episode booklet and discovered the title of the espisode to be ""Dark Awakening"". I checked my discs and could not find it. Did anyone else have this problem? I wonder... Otherwise, I do enjoy viewing the episodes I have."
4,Recived a defective set,"Transformers: 25th Anniversary Matrix Of Leadership Edition [The Complete Series]The Set itself receives an easy 5 stars mark, but my set can qualify for a 4 stars mark only.The third season in my set has a crack on the plastic holder... which in time would probably break down completely. Leaving me with a totally defective set.I know that Amazon would try to do their best to help, but that doesn't change my feeling at the moment."
2,"It's All There, But...","This was a *really expensive* upgrade from my previous collection of G1 Transformers cartoons. Some of the special features are nice, don't get me wrong, but ultimately what I wanted was the cartoons... and I already had them, at a better price, years before this release. There's plenty of good things to say about this set, but ultimately, this is one helluva high price tag to put on some 25-year-old cartoons. I cannot recommend this set over other installments, particularly the Chinese option with its secondary English audio tracks (You guys know the one, right?). Buying THAT over THIS would save you $50-80 depending on the seller.I hate to be such a naysayer, but Hasbro et al have made a pretty damning cash-grab here. This is clearly for them, not for the fans."
5,Choir music at its best,"Beautiful recordings of classic sacred music performed by a choir that will long be remembered, disciplined, articulate, committed. Robert Shaw was surely gifted with his interpretations of this great music."
2,Light on Guidance,"This book contains interesting information about the origin of this design style but little detail about any of the many varieties that were/are being made. It is about 2/3 taken up with photographs of various styles but with only one or two pieces of any given style and no details about each or any idea of what the variety of other pieces within each style look like, so it is nearly impossible to truly identify the style you have or want. I was interested in the information, but found little guidance in my quest to discover more about the pieces that I own. Even the prices given are merely a recount of the price paid for each piece; but not when the purhcase was made or under what conditions or whether this is a reflection of the relative ""value"" of a given style of the blue willow design."
3,What Can I say?,"Considering it's a Dell power supply, they work fine. I bought these for replacing the same PS units that die on me at work."
2,Power supply,The product I received did not work and since this was a christmas gift this was a great inconvience for me. I didnt received a replacement product until after the first of the year and then when I tried to return the faulty product they had not paid enough shipping for it to be returned. I dont think I will be doing business with these people again.
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.....................,"I LOVE THIS WATCH, IT HAS IT ALL, ITS MY THIRD ONE, LAST TWO WERE DESTROYED FROM, WORK, YOU WANT SOMETHING THATS SPORTY, DEPENDABLE AND HAS 24 HOURS WITH DATE, THIS IS IT......ENJOY"
3,Watch construction,"The watch itself,for the price is great. Not too crazy about the sturdiness of the bezel. It seems cheaply put together,unlike the Seiko Divers watch that I previously purchased. I have NEVER seen a bezel that turns both ways on a watch,it's always clockwise.This one will turn in either direction,which is a bit disconcerting."
4,Nice watch - Not so nice vendor.,"Looks great, feels right, does its job. The fact that it doesn't have a light is not a biggie. Watch was full of condensation (water) within a week of using it, probably a bad seal or something, vendor replaced after nearly a week of emails and me paying for the return shipping. I was told I would receive a 5$ refund on my amazon account for the shipping, never happened. The new watch has a defect on the paint on the outside ring, I can live with it so no more problems and extra money spend."
1,Fog up,"I purchased this watch on a different website, took it to swimming, and started to see fog fog within. The watch looks great, so I am going to exchange it for another one."
4,"Great watch, celebrity endorsed","I wrote a full review over on the Caveman Watch Forum, for those interested, but here is a short one, since most people will never even get this far into the reviews. ;)This watch is of surprising quality for the modest price. You WILL pay more than a typical Casio with the same feature set, because it has a solid stainless steel case, back, and buckle. None of this chrome-plated crap like Timex likes to put out these days.Although the watch is pretty big, at 45mm diameter, not including the crown, it fits my 6-7/8"" wrist fine. There are other models that have dial/hands combos that offer better contrast than this one, but this one is a little more dressy and unique, with its gold dial.I've uploaded some of my pix, for your viewing pleasure."
4,Like an Old Friend,I had an identical watch when I was in the Army but it was destroyed in Vietnam. When I saw it I had to order it. It came 3 days early and meets all my expectations.
4,nice,Watch came on time and as advertized. Looks nice and functions as expected. Works with both casual and dress wear. A keeper
1,This watch stopped keeping analog time after a week of daily use,"I bought this watch as my every day watch- and mainly wanted to use it snorkeling and diving since it was rated to go over 100 feet,Even before I ever got it in the water, the analog clock would lose time within the first week of ownership.I would see that the second hand would just get ""stuck"" at random times... Sometimes if I pushed one of the buttons it would start working again.I ended up diving with it and snorkeling numerous times and the watch stayed dry.Unfortunately, the random time losses were too annoying to deal with so I returned the watch.I found that the digital time was accurate, but too small to read in low light conditions."
4,Great Value- good watch,"Looks a lot more expensive than it is- well worth the price. The gold face is quite attractive and distinctive. Keeps good time. I use it as a beater watch- if something happens to it I'm not going to be out $300 dollars. The digital functions are useful without the LCD being too noticable- stopwatch, calendar,etc.The only negative is the bezel- its not as tight fitting as more expensive watches, and its not unidirectional so i wouldn't actually use it for diving.One other thing to consider- Amazon frequently has watch specials with brands like Invicta or Seiko. Under these specials you can get better watches for about $60-100. They won't have the functions of this watch, but will be higher quality and last longer."
2,Not the quality of the G-shock line,"I have been a more than happy with the G-Shock line of Casio watches and assumed this one would carry some of their quality features. Unfortunately, the rotating bezel came off after 2 months of low impact use. This was the only part of the watch's structure that protects the face of the watch and I fear scratches or worse are sure to follow. If you're on the fence stick with the G-Shock."
1,Beautiful Watch does not keep time. Returned once and still not fixed.,I have no clue where I can get this watch worked on.I only wear it on special occasions but neither the analog or digital part of the watch will keep time correctly.
2,Beware,"After having the first watch's sweep hands stop working altogether, I ordered a replacement via Amazon. I wish I had bought the first on Amazon, but didn't and it cost me due to Sports Authority's return policy. Anyway, the second watch came and once again the sweep hands started to malfunction after only 4 months. Thankfully, Amazon allowed me to return the watch for a full refund and I'm off to another brand. Two malfunctioning watches out of two orders cannot be random!"
5,Great watch!,"I've had this watch for over ten years. I've had the battery replaced a few times, have replaced the straps once, and it just keeps on going. I spent a lot of time outdoors and this watch is very durable, it has taken a lot of abuse without any trouble."
2,Don't be a sucker !,"I was a sucker...twice.Both times I had the watch snugly strapped to my wrist.I somehow bumped it while surfing, causing it to break from my wrist to the ocean floor, gone forever. I bought another one. Same thing happened at my office, fell to the floor and crystal broke. This has never happened to the myriad watches I've owned over the past 3 decades. Casio not responsive. Very disappointed."
1,Time OUT!,"I bought this watch from another store, but it's necessary to share my opinion here to assist others. It is a fairly nice looking watch and the price was low so I bought one. It was purchased as a replacement ""beater"" watch, that could be worn for fishing, etc. Water resistance was a big factor as well as looks. It was to replace my G-Shock that had lasted for many years of rough use. I wanted a ""dressier"" look. Mistake! The problem with this watch is that the crystal has NO protection and it scratches VERY easily. Definitely a HUGE negative. The scratches made it difficult to see the face, so I gave it away. A waste of money. I've never had a crystal scratch so easily!"
1,"Beware of ""Perfumeville""","With a name like that I should have been aware. Have been an amazon customer for over 5 yrs, and have never dealt with a crooked seller before, but this seller never sent my watch, should be banned from amazon! Didn't pay attention, used one click and assumed I was buying direct from amazon, got hosed, buyer beware."
1,Claim,"What a review? Though I placed an order for men's Casio divers watch on Sept. 19, 2007, I have not yet received it from you or Chelsea Watches.I paid U$67.00 for the watch on the same day. So far I have not received the watch or your refund."
4,Good value,Great watch for the price . It was better looking in person that the picture. My husband was very pleased.
4,good for a sportsman,"do yourself and the rest of us who wear this consistently a favor and wear this only if you have muscular forearms, otherwise it looks out of place. This is not a watch that will make your arms look more than what they are like some others have a tendency to do. I wear it as a business casual accent and also when swimming."
3,Composer: Hummel,"I bought this opera thinking that Schnittke's opera ""Gesualdo"" was finally in print...the info page on this recording listed Hummel as the Performer ... He's actually the composer...upon hearing he's a competent modern composer musically related to Schnittke....there's A LOT of recitive in this opera...just didnt want anyone to repeat my mistake."
5,Sweet little box,"Arrived in MUCH less time than the order estimate, and was in perfect condition. Quickly hooked up my Technics SL-DD02 and my XM Radio home dock to the aux input. Unit works exactly as promised and the sound is sweet - in fact, I think now I need a better cartridge! Only quibble is I had to turn the level up all the way to get the volume to match other items on my SONY receiver (STR-DH520) but so far, no noise or hum, and the live Badfinger album I am listening to is sounding pretty darned good. Excellent way to add vinyl playback to a new system - just get a good turntable and cartridge - and enjoy!"
2,Didn't finish it,"Written in 1942, and set in a house in Washington DC during the early days of the war, this looked promising. But I gave up after less than 75 pages because I found the ""heroine,"" who was I think supposed to be 'plucky,' a ninny. The murder takes place right away, but when it turned into what seemed to become an espionage tale I lost all interest. So maybe not a fair review."
3,not impressed,works but not a very stable solution. design can be improved with a second clip from the top. overpriced for the real value.
2,Does not work for ukuleles!!!!,"Does not work for ukuleles, for more than say that can be adapted as a review that I saw on youtube, no way! Does not work for ukuleles! Luckily I have an acoustic guitar and I use this product."
3,A Fatal Paranoia,"Here is a neat little Outer Limits episode concerning a colony of Earth scientists on another planet where things have gone terribly wrong. Warren Oates plays botanist Reese Fowler who is accidentally caught in a rain of radioactive isotopes which turns him into a bug-eyed mutant who never sleeps, reads minds and can kill with only his thoughts. His condition drives him insane and he torments his crewmen into remaining on the planet to keep him company. This is an example of how sometimes The Outer Limits could make an exciting episode on a shoestring budget by just concentrating on the mood of the piece. The Mutant induces a real feeling of paranoia and claustrophobia and has a wonderfully disturbing effect upon the viewer. Recommended!"
5,Enertaining episode,"This is the only episode of The Outer Limits that I have seen. This episode was entertaining and interesting. Despite me being 18, I still like watching black and white episodes and movies. I don't know if this is one of the weaker episodes of The Outer Limits like another reviewer said, but I enjoyed this episode very much."
1,"Dissatisfied, don't buy.","I have had these steps in the pool for about a week. Inspite of following manufactures installation instructions, the steps still float. My liner is leaking and algae is forming under and around these steps no matter how I treat the water and scrub. Also, if you use an automatic pool cleaner such as Kreepy Krauly, it will not work properly unless you stay at the pool and everytime it tries to go around the steps manualy move it away from the steps or it gets stuck. The steps are bolted to the deck and not made to remove everytime you want to clean. As far as entry into the pool, the steps are great. But definetly not worth the problems they cause. Think carefully before you purchase. I paid $380 and am trying to work out a deal with where I bought them to return them. I would just about as soon take a big loss. I'm also going to have to replace my new liner if I can't find where it is leaking. And yes, I do have the pad under the steps."
4,Men's Watch,"The watch looks nice, but the band is way too small for my husband. We will have to go somewhere to purchase a band to go with the face of the watch."
5,A Wonderful Classic Christmas Addition,"I've always loved this wonderful classic television show along with the unforgettible songs. Now that this CD edition has been added to my classic Christmas collection, It will always bring back memories of my childhood years. If you've also been a fan of this since your childhood, be sure to add this to your collection so you and your family can relive the magic of sharing and caring over and over again."
3,Spotty,"Generally, I liked this book, but I think that's only because I like the concept of Eleanor Roosevelt as a sleuth. The major plot twists were too obvious--without their purpose being very clear, which is quite a feat indeed. And I'd have to go back and read some of Elliot Roosevelt's other books to make sure, but I'd swear he's plagiarized himself in a few spots. Those club scenes sounded *awfully* familiar."
3,"Decent plot, convoluted sentence structure.","Enjoyed the plot - but wasn't impressed with the wordage. So much so, I even checked to see when written, as it appeared to be from much longer ago than 1984! Possibly the author was schooled elsewhere than the US?"
1,Absolutely not,"After reading the story for this, I had to admit that I wanted to give it a try and I was hoping for some flesh from Ms Delaney, but that aside, I was hoping that I would get something for what I paid, unfortunately the twist at the end and the so called baddie turns out to be something totally different.I am not going to savage it, but believe me it is tempting. I hated the twist and I didn't like how it turned out at the end at all. The one thing I hate is hoping a film you entrust your time to lets you down completely and just basically annoys you. Waste of money I'm afraid. I was not impressed. Can't get rid of it now, but it is in a box and it isn't coming out. I like to give rare a nd lesser known films a chance, but I don't like it when they let me down. Alas it happens."
2,Red Shoes Drifter,"I selected this movie based on the NY Times review blurb on the box: ""A Fatal Attraction with a cleaver gender twist."" Maybe so, I didn't last long enough to find out. As much as I watched reminded me of polite Show Time light erotica. I didn't find the story line compelling or even present. May pick up, but it didn't hold my interest. Fans of Red Shoe Diaries may find this title more entertaining then I. Average, R-rated hetro erotica. NY Times misleads a lot it seems."
3,Hardly for those considering NOT to be mothers,"I am 4/5 through the book. I thought I was about to be enlightened, by being presented with an equal view of those who decided to BE mothers, and those who decided NOT to be. I am dissapointed to find that near reaching the last 1/5 of the book, among about 10 stories of women who have decided to become mothers, only one was of a woman who chose not to. Another bothersome point was the fact the thruogh most of the book, the topic of the economic weight a child brings was not discussed AT ALL. I was impressed that all (or most?) of the featured women were very well off economically. Or, perhaps it is the American work morals that are taken for granted (i.e. willing to spend the other part of life working hard to hold that family)."
3,Easy isn't always good...,"The good things:- It works! (One shouldn't overlook how important this part is!)- It is easy to set up.The not so good things:- It really really really needs more video and network settings. For example, to control the frames per second and the polling rate.- More info. If you don't use the stupid network wizard, it never tells you anywhere the info you need to do it manually, (nor online). The port numbers listed in the device are not inclusive.- Warning. If you have highspeed internet connection via cable, you may not have the upload bandwidth needed to get anything useful out of it remotely. The local cable companies frequently lie/mislead you about your UPLINK bandwidth..."
4,not for night security,"good size camera,easy to connect, easy to view images in the computer/web. I wanted to record outdoor activity, but this camera only gave a visible image for one hr out of the day when the light was perfect according to the camera - basically sunny days, evening and in between did not record. For the one hour that there was an image(6 am)it recorded clearly & in color. I tried adjusting everything, but it didn't work... may work indoors only, or mine was broken..."
2,LAN not WAN,"I got this thing up and viewable on my local network, but could never access the image over the web. Quite a disappointment. I do not recommend it."
1,Terrible software instructions,I can never install the Createive-provided software on my XP professional and gave up. I probably put it up on ebay for somebody else who get more time to toy with it. My friend bought same item. He was able to install the software but cannot access the cam from work for some reason. I recommended Panansonic Wireless 802.11 b/g Network Camera which I bought for about $270 . It is more expensive but worth the price.
3,"Creative Live! Connects Wireless, but no to chat programs","I got this product because I wanted to connect to a website wirelessly, but I also wanted to use it for chat. It said it could do both. It lied. My computer could not see the camera for any of my chat programs. I returned it and gave up on the idea of having a wireless cam for chats. Maybe someday in the future it will be a possibility. SO if you want a security camera, this one is fine, but that is all it can do."
1,"Me encanta El Chavo, PERO..........","Este DVD es una burla a los consumidores, son varios capitulos revueltos con un tiempo total de media hora, que horror!!!!Preferible seguir disfrutandolo en la tele hasta que televisa haga un producto del cual valga la pena comprar. Que pena........"
1,Terrible Edting and a ripoff to chespirito fans.,I was really exited at first when i purchased this volume but my happiness plunged to bitter dissapointment as soon as I played the dvd. All the episodes are edited and extremey short. Some of the best scenes are also so short that this is truly a ripoff for fans like myself. I do not recommend this at all unless you wanna throw your money away. They should really remaster and sell this dvd with the full episodes as shown on tv otherwise this will really hurt the chespirito marketing thugs.
1,"No compren esta ""colecci√≥n"". Es ""Lo Peor del Chavo""","Hace poco termin√© de leer ""Sin Querer Queriendo"", la autobiograf√≠a de Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os... Extraordinaria. Un trabajo noble, franco, sensible, muy humano. Como El Chavo... De todos los programas que me criaron, ""El Chavo del 8"" fue A-1. Lo v√≠ por primera vez en 1977 y a√∫n hoy reviso ""Canal de Las Estrellas"" para ver alg√∫n cap√≠tulo. Este programa se merece una edici√≥n super especial y ultra completa. Deber√≠an incluir todos, TODOS los cap√≠tulos (no res√∫menes...), ""blopers"", tras c√°maras, entrevistas, fotos, escenas nunca antes vistas, etc... Todo el archivo (en manos de Televisa...) volcado en DVD de alta calidad. No esta porquer√≠a de ""Lo Mejor de..."" Quien les dijo a √©stos que El Chavo tiene capitulos mejores y peores? El Chavo es perfecto. Por favor, no se conformen con esta basura. Pidamos una verdadera edici√≥n a la medida de nuestra lealtad y de la calidad del programa."
5,El Chavo del Ocho rules!,"El Chavo Del Ocho volume 1 is so cool! It brings back memories of my youth in Chihuahua Mexico. Too bad Mexico dont have these types of programs any more.If you have any small children at home they will love el chavo!this dvd lasts aprox 2 hours and it has lots of material from the earliest episodes including several songs that my mamasita used to sing to me when i was a young chavo, it is soo good that I immediatly ordered volumes 2 and 3 and I cant wait for volume 4 to come out November 2003."
3,"Timeless show. But, don't buy this DVD.","Oh wow, I grew up with this and it was great. This is a great show for the entire family. Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os was a genius at writing and playing El Chavo. The show is full of innocent humor and it was great watching this as a kid (and I grew up in the 1990s). The show features great and memorable characters such as El Chavo, la Chilindrina, Do√±a Florinda, el Profesor Girafales, Don Ram√≥n and many others.But, the DVD deserves a much lower rating. It does not have the complete episodes, just an abridged version. As the title says, it is a ""Best of..."" which is merely a collection of clips of the show. Note also, that the entire DVD only lasts 30 minutes. This is not a value item as it is overpriced and is not a complete series. It is not even an entire episode."
1,"This is noise, not music","Unless you really like semi-random noise pretending to be music save your money. Buy the 'FourPlay' DVD-A instead.But don't take my word for it - look here too:[another website]They say it much more eloquently and completely than I care to. On top of it all the media I was shipped was obviously not new product. Although it had no noticable data errors there were easily visible scuffs on the data side surface. Not that data errors would really harm the musicality of this 'performance'. I suspect I'm not nearly the first person to return this gem, and probably not the last either. If you ignore this review and plunk down your $$$, remember that Amazon has a great return policy - you'll most likely use it."
2,I was looking for music; what I found was noise.,"This album is 90% random sounds with no rythym, tune or melody. The composers may be ""cutting edge"" to a music critic, but to the rest of us, they sound like a 4th grade class's weekend project.Track #1, the first piece, is actually someone speaking aloud different things found in her room. For 5 minutes she says things like, ""A powered speaker; a painting; a philodendren"" Who cares? This is not music, it is noise.On the other hand, track #5 is a recording of a trumpet solo played in an abandoned water tower over a recording of various percussion artifacts from a museum. My family and I actually enjoyed this piece and wanted more. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is more similar to track #1.If you are looking for soemthing to play in a group so you can make fun of San Fransisco based weirdo composers - this is your album. Otherwise, stick to something classical."
2,"nice surround, but mostly noise not music","At first it seemed interesting even if drastically non-traditional, but as each track went on and on it seemed to descened more and more into a cacaphony of grating random noise that hurt my ears. I cannot even stand to listen to the whole thing in one sitting unless I turn the volume way down... Definitely was a waste of my money. Everyone's different so you may like this kind of thing but please beware and don't waste money like I did."
2,Immersion (DVD-Audio),"It's good for demo purposes, although I was a little surprised that the full 7:1 format was not exploited. A lot of emphasis was placed on various sound effects - mixing and shaping etc. etc. Perhaps, some people would regard this as 'creative', but musically speaking, this disc did nothing for me whasoever.I have it for sale if anyone would like it."
2,A couple of good tracks,Overall there are a couple of good tracks but overall this dvd-audio is not worth it. I bought it and couldn't even listen through it once.
1,"Not what your thinking, or at least what I was thinking","Okay, after reading some of the reviews I was excited that this might be the disk to show off the sound system. I was assuming (and you know what happens when you do that) that this would be something along the ""jazzy"" or easy listening genre. I listened to to the first 5 or 6 tracks and was very disappointed. The ""music"" is different artists and a very artistic approach to a colaboration of noises. Granted they are nicely mixed in 5.1 surround, and do take advantage of the different channels, but NOT entertaining.Obviuosly everyone has their own tastes, and for comparision, I listen to everything but country. I returned the disk and took the heavy restocking fee, but something is better than nothing, as I would never listen to this again."
2,It's a good surround tester but not enjoyable to me.,This collection demonstrates the creative & engineering feats that shows how well balanced your surround setup is. The Amazon review says it's classical. I was disappointed that it isn't. I didn't read the reviews until too late.
1,WARNING,"WARNING: This DVD-AD is catagorized under ""classical"" music, but I don't believe most people would consider the sounds on this disk to be classical music. In fact, I don't believe most people would recognize it as music. It should be catagorized as something like New Age sounds. To add to the confusion, there are no sample tracks available to listen to. I've only listened to it once. It is interesting, but I'm not sure if I'll listen to it again."
2,Immersion DVD-Audio,"I'm still not sure what to think of this. It isn't really anything. It is a decent showcase for a 5.1 system, but it's so boring and repetitive that you can't sit and listen to it for more than 5 min. Big disappointment."
1,This is not music,I call this sound effects. Maybe it's good as a demo for your sound system but after only a brief listen I can say for sure this is not something I will listen to again.
1,Couldn't make it through the disc,"I'm a fan of all sorts of conventional music:Pop, Rock, Classical, Jazz, Blues, Techno, etc.I can't classify this stuff. It sounds as if some people with computers were testing out surround sound by placing disparate noises across the sound field."
1,"Interesting concept, but...","I was excited to listen to this on the DVD-Audio player in my car...after listening to all of the tracks, I came to the conclusion that this may be the worst audio disc that I've ever purchased. I can only imagine the type of person who would enjoy this type of music. Don't waste your hard earned bucks on this mindless crap..."
2,where's the music?,a neat example of dvd-audio but only a couple tracks came close to being listenable. mostly noise
2,I've tried...and tried...and I couldn't get through it all,"I have had this DVD for a couple of months now. I bought it after I saw one of the reviews say that it's one of the best CDs to show off your 5.1 system. Well...I loved the ""airplane"" noise, but for the life of me I could not stand to hear most of the tracks. I am 24 y/o male with a very open mind. But as hard as I tried, even in empty parking lots, I could not bring my self to hear it all. I was using an Acura TL 5.1 system...and it was just painful to my ears.Buy this only if you really really know who these people are and have enjoyed their works in the past."
1,Yuck.,"I buy a fair amount of DVD-Audio material. Usually I have stuck to artists I already knew, but thought I would take a flyer on this one. Beeping, bleeping, honking, mumbling. I don't mind someone trying something different, but this stuff just isn't inspiring, fun, stimulating or in any way enjoyable. It is just annoying. Anyone want a good deal on a used copy? (how is that for poor advertising?)"
2,Interesting....but not entertaining,"Just buy that fancy new DVD-A system and looking for something to show off the great sound? This disk will come in handy for that once or twice.Looking for great music to play periodically for your listening enjoyment? Look somewhere else because this ""music"" was designed to show off the strenghths of the surround sound medium - not to entertain people.Most of the tracks show off the amazing capabilities of a good surround sound system but I found myself hitting fast forward after a couple minutes of each track. That was the first time through the DVD! I tried to listen to it a 2nd time a few weeks ago to see if maybe I missed something the first time but no, it just isn't something that is enjoyable to listen to.Find some music you like - don't waster your cash on this DVD. In fact - I'll send you this one, you can listen to it once, then pass it on to the next person for their one use, etc."
5,distinctive,"I collect new music recordings, and this is one of the most distinctive ones I've recently purchased."
1,Not the best example of DVD-Audio,"Not the best example of DVD-Audio...or of surround sound. I hated this DVD apart from the opening and closing tracks. It is atonal music with few melodies or anything resembling what I would classify as music. I wouldn't have minded if from a ""technical"" point of view it showed off the possibilities of DVD-AUDIO and 5.1 surround sound - but I don't believe it does either. If you want to hear an example of a good use of DVD-AUDIO listen to Bjorks ""Medulla"", even if you're not keen on Bjork it is worth listening to, to experience what the format is capable of."
1,"WAIT.... DON""T PRESS ORDER 'TIL YOU READ","I will admit it, I am not one of those ""high-brow"" music ""artsy-fartsy"" snobs. Perhaps, if I was, I'd lie and tell you that this DVD-a was ""pure genius"". I will not lie, the IMMERSION DVD was annoying noise at best and a complete waste of money. Common!!!! The creative artists on this albumn were desperate for material. Perhaps the company that put this compilation together put out a call to the music industry asking for their most unlistenable material. Well we have some real winners here folks! Just to give you a taste of what is to follow, the first track begins with a woman walking around her apartment with a microphone and just saying the names of innanimate objects that she sees. Wow, this was, pure genius!Don't be fooled like I was, save your money! I feel completely ripped off!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This is bad,I love music. But this is not music. Don't be fooled into thinking that the people that don't like it are somehow out of touch.
1,This is not music.....,"I bought this CD for my father to test out his new Dolby Digital 5.1 Theater...needless to say, I was embarrassed someone actually calls this music. It is random noise. It's definitely not the type of CD that you would invite friends over to listen to. My advice....stay away from it. There are other CD's out there that actually play music."
1,It's mostly noise,"After reading the reviews I thought this would be a good addition to my very small library of DVD Audio. WRONG! Unless you are into random noise with very little melody at all, then please give this a miss. I get the sense there was very little thought or effort into ""composing these TUNES (for lack of a better word)""."
1,"Came in useful, but not in the way it was intended","This DVD-audio came in handy. I cracked another DVD-audio disk case, and transfered the cover art, and disk over to this case. I then threw out this disk."
1,it blows more than a ten cent crack whore,"like the title says to this review it blows so hard that i would rather get aids and die then read this piece of filth. its about some black dude that decides to rape this girl. well he does and the only good thing about this book is he dies. the only reason it gets a star is i cant put anything less, otherwise, it would get a negative 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 star. do not buy this book it is garbage that should be burnt with the body of osama bin laden."
1,One of the WORST pieces of crap I have ever read,"I was forced to read this in high school and it was awful. The characters behave idiotically as if they have no common sense. Liberals including my literature teacher love this book because of of the pro-communist and ""blame the white man"" views. I'm not white, and I still found it impossible to relate to Bigger. Young adults would enjoy books more if they weren't forced to read bad novels like this."
3,Native Son,"Native son was a good book that showed the life back in the time of the civil war which is a time period which i think is very interesting. I read this book for school and if i did not have to read it i would have probably never gave it a chance. I did feel that it was boring especially when there was a 20 page closing statement. That i felt was boring. Overall, it was not the worst book i have ever read but i would probably never read it again."
1,CRAP,"well.. someone who murders anyone..out of panic either (which is a really stupid, irrational reason) does not deserve any sympathy. I felt the book was mainly about black people hating white people..as usual. now, tell me anyone....if there was a book about a white person facing discrimination in Africa..or being killed because stones are thrown at them, then everyone would look down on them. poorly written."
5,Quieting,"When I finished reading this book I felt quieted and stilled. This book reached inside of me and showed me so many ugly things that I try not to think about. It reawoke in me the sense of anger that makes me want to yell out in the streets ""Are you people all blind?!"" The issuses disscussed in this book are as relevent today as they were in the 1940's, when the book was written. These problems will never go away on their own. My hope is that people will read this book and stop congradulating themselves on never making racist slurs. The racial tension in this country goes so much deeper than a just few jokes or stereotypes. This edition of the book includes several key passages that were removed from the 1940s edition. This novel, along with The Grapes of Wrath, stands out in my mind as one of the most important novels to be found in American literature. I cannot recomend this enough."
2,Eye opening but boring novel,This novel is worth reading as it describes the hardships on blacks in the early 1900s. It is somewhat touching but it is really boring and I fell asleep through it many many times. I had to get a copy of Clff Notes to help me get through it.
4,This was a great book!,"I really liked this book. It told me a lot about things that were done back in the 1900's. I believe Bigger Thomas was not looking for trouble, but it always seemed to find him. It was an excellent book. I would definitely recommend this book to others!"
2,Read Invisible Man Instead,"This story is told in three books. After the first book, when Bigger is caught, the story plunges into a anticlimax. The story stops completely. This is the first and only book that I didn't finish reading.I recommend Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man."
5,Great read,Wright gives insight to the pyschological conditioning that can effect a person choices(another person mentioned choices but the book is deeper than just choices it goes in the aspect of what sociological elements effect decisions). A major aspect of the book is the power of fear and how it can effect decisions. In addition the wonderful underlying message(s) in the book the plot takes you on a dramatic journey.
3,Its a matter of responsibility,"All the customer reviews so far have seemed to overlook the fact that the book is very simply an argument of social determinism versus personal responsibility. Bigger murders Mary, and although it was accidental he refuses to take responsibility for it. Later he goes on to kill Bessie in order to protect himself. He goes to trial and Max uses the Communist based argument of social determinism. Wright shows us his Communist colors and beliefs vividly during this portion of the book. It is obvious that he was a member of the Communist Party when he wrote this novel. And at this point I think it isn't because he really feels responsible or remorse but because he wants Max to realize that he really doesn't care either way. Bigger had known from the time that he was a young black boy that he would probably end up in jail or dead."
2,This novel put a wrong twist on murder and rape.,This novel gave the impression that murder and rape are okay just as long as the people you kill were mean to you and you are stupid. Bigger had no just cause of the two murders he commited and no matter what you have been through or the color of you skin you have no right to kill two very innocent girls.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this book for my husband. I vaguely remember seeing a few minutes of the movie when I was young and I thought it might be something he would enjoy. He feels the story is unrealistic and over-dramatized. Also, the language was repeatedly offensive and my husband put the book down after about 20 pages. I disposed of it. I do not recommend it for anyone and certainly not for young people. Denise Massey"
2,"Interesting, yet offensive.","I found Native Son an interesting short story, yet I was offended by the violence and the foul language which seemed to be littered throughout the book."
2,Wouldn't be the best thing,"So I had to read the book, as an assignment in my english class. I really don't recommend anyone to read the introduction of the book. The introduction is garbage, it talks about why the author wrote the book, So I skipped a few pages in it. Bigger committed a few murders, big deal!The book didn't get interesting till the end where Bigger Thomas was at the court room with Max. Max did put up a good fight and stood by Bigger throughout the whole thing. I think the true stars of the book were Max and Jan. Jan because he wasn't mad at Bigger for casting blame on him and Max because he treated Bigger like a human, and totally out shunned the State Attorney.The book showed the oppression of blacks throughout the 1940's, yes the book was hella boring but it thought a good lesson, treat people with respect!"
5,Heartbreaking...,"Richard Wright's work makes you feel the oppression, frustration, pain and anguish Bigger Thomas experiences. I'm glad my lit professor introduced this book to me!"
3,It's not for everyone,"This Is a great book. One written for a specific purpose. Richard wright not only criticizes the white community but the black community as well. He comes through his characters quite a bit as well. However this book is not for everyone. The first two parts vary greatly from the last part of the book. And I personally was not convinced by he dramatic change in tone and language. Good book, worth reading if you are and English major but it's not the best book I've ever read either"
5,excellent,"I buy most of my books at Amazon.com because of the reviews and low prices plus they monitor my credit card purchases in case of theft or stolen cards; I love Amazon and purchase not only books but other items on occasion. This book is excellent in plot, descriptive writing, resolution and the author's ability to show his character to his audience. I highly recommend this classic and taught it to my high school classes."
5,"""The Native Son""","As far as the shape and price of the book I was very pleased.. The book was not for me, it was for my brother in law.. I had no trouble finding what i needed, and had no trouble finalizing and paying for my order. Very satisfies with amazon and will refer friends and family to the site."
4,It shows true things that go on in today's society,"The first time look at the Native Son book, I didn't want to read it because of it's size. But once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down. This book to me shows the reality of life in certain situations. Just like the racial issues. The higher culture, basically the Caucasion race, seem to put down the subcultures , such as Afican Americans, Mexicans, and so forth. It shows that these subcultures have to hide things and so forth just to get jobs, prove that they are right, while the white society practically get anything they want. I would recommend this book to anybody because it keeps a person's interest."
5,"Wow! Native Son was the best book, I ever read.",Native Son was a very good and influential novel. I should be read by ever high school student around the world. It teaches and tells a story in the most entertaining way. You will never want to put down the novel. Each page is filled with great description and great detail. It deserves ***** stars.
5,formative and formidable,"I read Wright's book at a time when I was wrestling with my own conservative roots. Wright doesn't try to draw our sympathy to an innocent black man wrongly accused. Bigger killed a white girl. He kills again while on the run. This guy deserves the chair or hanging, right?But Bigger's acts are rightly portrayed in the light of his position in society. He is a black man in 1930s white America. He is trapped. This doesn't absolve his sins, but it does put some of his blood and that of his victims on our hands. We are all culpable for the violent effects of racism and other societal evils. Or as Mick put it, ""I shouted out 'Who killed the Kennedy's?' when after all it was you and me."""
5,Living for the City...,"A compelling read from start to finish, this book tells the story of Bigger Thomas, a black youth living in the Chicago ghetto during the 1930s. Bigger Thomas is an archtype for the experience of black youths, the black struggle in America. I have read ""Sonny's Blues,"" ""Invisible Man,"" but I have found this novel the most powerful of the three.This is also a great read for the would-be fiction writer. It's all here: plot, character, setting and gripping story telling that holds you to the end.A must read."
5,Native Son is a book worth reading,"The novel, Native Son, is a great story that illustrates racism in America. The main character, Bigger Thomas is continually treated unfairly because he is black. When he gets a job with a wealthy white family he accidently murders their daughter out of fear. He tries to cover up the murder and burns her body. He continues to try to escape because he is afraid that he is going to get arrested. He continues to run and gets into more trouble trying to escape. All of Bigger's acts of violence were done out of fear. Bigger is arrested and treated as a violent criminal. This novel illustrates that people can be mischaracterized by their actions when people don't actually know the person. In this novel, the reader gets to know Bigger's innocent, fearful character. This makes the reader feel sorry for Bigger and allows the reader to understand the effects of racism. The novel is filled with action and suspense that keeps the reader interested."
1,A very well written book with a major philosophical defect.,"While Richard Wright does an excellent job of writing the book and depicting Bigger's (The main character) feelings and motivations, he has a major problem: He portrays Bigger as a human without a conscience both through Bigger's thoughts and through Max's (Bigger's lawyer) testimony. By doing this, he (shockingly) arrives at the conclusion that Bigger is not responsible for his two gruesome murders. The one redeeming quality of the book (when it's not graphically depicting violence and sex) is that it inspires a large amount of thought."
2,"Disturbing, Yet Boring","The first part of the book kept my interest with odd action, but as Wright preaches to the reader through Bigger's lawyer near the end, the book takes a turn for the worst. This book was overall terrible."
3,Native Son,"This book is very ""stagy,"" in the sense that the characters confront one another in contrived scenes and make speeches to one another. These speeches have a lot to say about race relations in the 1930s (they were bad) and give us a window into the liberal intellectual climate of the time (Communism was admired). Conservatives will not enjoy this book because it concludes that the central character, a murderer, is not fully responsible for his actions because society made him what he is. While not subtle, this book dramatically portrays the exploitation of a segregated black minority during the depression era in the United States.The Perennial Classics edition, which I would recommend, includes an introduction by Arnold Rampersad, an excellent chronology of Richard Wright's life, and notes."
4,An important classic,"My opinion that the courtroom scene at the end drags on a bit too long and is basically one big monologue rather than a continuation of the riveting plot of this masterpiece is the only thing that keeps me from awarding it 5 stars. Not only a great novel, but an important one."
1,dissappointing,"I read it over 20 years ago and after reading it again I come to the realization that only stories that portray Black men as psychopathic, rapists,women beaters and/or murders make it to the publisher's shelves. The story is a ficticious portrayal of a psychopath under the guise of racism. NO amount of racism anywhere in the world can excuse this type of behavior. It is a pity that we continue to portray this type of story as an example of true Black Literatue."
5,Native Son,"absolutely the most suspenseful novel I have ever read! In fact, I have not been able to read another book w/o comparing it to Native Son. This book definitely raised the bar for me and what I read..and I have yet to have read a better told story. Richard Wright was a genius!"
5,excellent book to read on black struggles,"I liked this book because it was about a character who face many struggles. He had conflicts between family, friends, girl friend, and his own behavior on life. I could understand where the character was coming from especially on his situations, money wise. The story gave me a sense of feeling on living a poverty life and what occurs in our mind. Loved this novel will get you to read, lots of exiting events in characters life"
1,not worth it,"Frankly, this product is absolutely useless considering the residue that it leaves on your skin. Usually most honey wax products are water soluble but this one is a toto disappointment...finally I had to shell money on buying the wash off residue lotion as well....I may as well go the salon and get it done...."
4,solid sampler,The label does a good job compiling a decent sampling of Christy's work.A good albumn if you are unfamiliar with his work.Most of his albumns can be pricey imports (if you're a yank) so this is a safe way to see if you dig his stuff
1,moore,"This guy is about as anti-American as you can get. He sings America, You Are not the World aka Burning. The lyrics are in part:""America your head's too big, Because America, Your belly's too bigAnd I love you, I just wish you'd stay where you isBut where the president, Is never black, female or gay, And until that dayYou've got nothing to say to me, To help me believe""Any self respecting American Patriot should never buy any of this pornography"
1,THIS ALBUM IS A RIP OFF !!!,"This album is actually the second half of an album called Jazz Violin Summit on Legacy CD that I got for about $9.00. On the legacy album, the sound quality is top notch, and has five more songs with Stephane, and Jean Luc Ponty."
4,Under the radar. 3.8 stars,"When it comes to Overkill with their impressive 16 album history of metal it is easy to overlook a few albums. In my opinion, this is one of those albums. Under the Influence is underrated in so many forms. Although, the production is a little strange. Bobby still sings as great as he always does. This album was released in 1987 I think. So if you compare it to other albums from the same era, So Far So Good So What, And Justice For All in '88, and Among the Living you will see that this album ranks up there with some of the best. Im not saying it is the best from that time but the fact is, Overkill put out a good thrash effort its just too bad its been under the radar for this long."
4,Not so hard to find,I grew up listening to this album and it was next to impossible to find it on CD anywhere but here. Classic 80's thrash metal with a lot of shredding.
5,The 3rd album.,"This is the classic 3rd album from Overkill. The riffs are killer, the vocals as always are awesome and the drums make your pulse race. Awesome job!!!"
3,"Not bad, not great","""Hello from the Gutter"" is a classic, ""End of the Line"" and ""Shred"" are decent, but the rest are just ok or a bit clunky. Good for the hard-core Overkill fan, but if you're just starting out then try Taking Over or Horrorscope."
5,25 years later?,"I just noticed somebody mentioned that this is a 1981 album - personally, I owned the cassette and remember that the case was orange, but can't believe that it is 25 years old!A few months ago, the lyrics to 'Around the dial' popped into my head, and I couldn't get rid of them (maybe I should see someone?). So, what do I do? 2 things:1) I go and build a website based on the theme of the song and I call it djmoves.2) I go to itunes and buy around the dial and also better days. Around the Dial truly rocks hard - I can't get the volume loud enough! And 'better days' is like an Irish toast - it's one of those songs like Beautiful Day from U2 that just makes you feel ""better""... very uplifting.Other than Destroyer (which ALSO rocks hard), I honestly don't really remember enjoying the rest of the songs on the album, but am going to give them another chance soon."
5,A must have cd,"I'd have to agree with the other review. This is the best kinks album, I've had 2 cassettes and the album version and will definatly pick up this new SA CD. I dont know why the kinks havent put around the dial on thier greatest hits albums. I think the other reviewer below Patrick only thought there were two types of music Country and Western But then again he picked it up at a flea market."
4,Love the Kinks,I had this album back in the day. Hell I think that I saw this tour of America. 'Round the Dial still sounds great and Better Things is one of my favorite songs all time. Great album
4,"To all Kinks fans, are we weird?","I wish more people loved the Kinks as I do. Thanks fellow fans. Hey I don't give the albums good ratings because I like the Kinks. I give this album a good rating because I really like the music, period. The only reason I don't rate it higher is because I reserve 5 for a very few nearly perfect albums. The Kinks Low Budget, Jethro Tull's Aqualung to name two. I wonder who agrees with me. Anyway, the song ""Give the People what they Want"" is a high energy tour de force of pounding rock music and cool lyrics. The other songs are interesting and tell various stories. I just like this. Nothing more to say."
4,Good for the price,"I bought this CD when my choir was preparing to sing this piece in the original German. This CD is a German choir singing German which is hard to beat, and the price is attractive. Please note that this is a live CD, so the sound quality isn't what it could be. However, for this price it's hard to complain."
4,Very humorous biography about teenage boys in the 50s.,"Jackpine Savages is a very humorous biography about the life of teenage boys in the 1950s. It will bring back memories for men especially who were growing up in the 50s in a small town or rural area, this taking place in northern Wisconsin. The writing consists of chapters focused on topics of interest including school, sports, getting a job, and skinnydipping in the north woods. Interspersed in the humor are some valuable life lessons which adults can appreciate and from which youth can benefit. Because many of today's teenagers are interested in life in the 50's, they should especially enjoy this 170 page book."
3,CARBON FIBER TAPE,"This tape is pretty good,but don't expect it to stiffen up anything like a carbon spar would.It is very thin,and flexible.After using epoxy it adds a slight extra measure of stiffness.In general I'd have to say I like it.Carbon Fiber Tape, 3/4"" x 12'. I do find it to be very useful for my rc model airplane projects.BIGEMANN"
4,Clock Gongs,"Pieces arrived quickly. Found they did fit the gong base, but were of smaller diameter than the originals I was replacing."
5,Powerful data,"This book provides fantastic insight into the power of data to make the lives of consumers better by improving the quality and appropriateness of their experiences as well as the level of customer service they encounter. At the same time, it recalls Scott McNealy's (Chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems) famous statement, ""Privacy is dead. Get over it."" Fortunately, as the book indicates, there are still ways to protect yourself from harm, if not from wide awareness.The real life examples and numerous interviews with experts really make INESCAPABLE DATA come alive. It's a must read for those of us in the information industry and for those who are curious about how information is transforming our world."
4,Excellent book,Talks about stuff from a very high level. Useful even to software professionals. The last chapters make the book worthwhile.
3,Seemed to disturb my daughter...,I have a two month old daughter and I purchased this a month ago. She loves to stare and stare at the black and white patterns which is good - but it can keep her from napping in her crib because she can't sleep while staring at them. I flip over the panels when I am putting her down for a nap so they don't bother her.
4,Commentary Junkies Get Out Your Cash,"If you've seen this film you know that it's not great but it sure is fun. I was surprised to see Hollywood Boulevard get better treatment on DVD than some better quality films (As of this writing Citizen Kane has not been released on DVD) but that just makes this release all the more fun. The 3-way commentary by Joe Dante (Gremlins), Allan Arkush and Jon Davidson is what DVD commentaries are all about. They're funny, informative, and quite forthcoming with their feelings towards the film. An interesting passage occurs during Candice Rialson's rape scene. Everybody gets quiet. Clearly all were embarrassed by the scene. So much so they didn't know what to say except that all films of this nature had the obligatory rape scene. The stories about Paul Bartel and Roger Corman are a hoot. The disc looks and sounds as good as can be. If you're a fan of low budget fun this disc is worth your cash."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"This is a high quality book, but the illustrations are drab, dull and BORING. That's the major reason why I would not recommend this book. There is a cheaper edition of Wilde's fairy tales available at Amazon that has gorgeous illustrations and is a better value."
4,"Quick delivery, great price.",Received product promptly and for a good price. Would purchase from this seller again.
2,NBC + RATE HIKES + AMAZON = NO SALE,"I watched an entire season of BattleStar Galactica AND Heroes on ITUNES -It was easy, conveient, resonably priced - and seemingly fair. I REFUSE to support NBC's grab for more money! $15 for a 2 hour 'TV show' is certainly not a resonable price. I continue to enjoy Heroes recorded on my PVR and chuckle as I skip over the commercials - and I intend to enjoy the next season of BattleStar Galactica the same way. NBC is an old media dinasour forcing its own pricing structure onto digital downloads - shame on Amazon for enabling them!"
3,Still very good but should have been better,To some degree this is an unnecessary addition to the fabulous Battlestar Galactica series. It will have to do while we wait for season 4 to unfold but this extra storyline is not that interesting. The acting is excellent and visually it cannot be improved much but the storyline does not really make it for me.
3,Battlestar Galactica -Razer,I didn't exactly love it.The story was a little dark for me. I'm not much into abuse and murder of innocent persons for a story or plot to base the story line on.
3,But I didn't know it came in the Season Four Box!,"Okay, so Razor came when Season Four came...and Season Four had its own DVD Razor inside. So, my purchase ended up going to a friend.The placing of Razor within the Season Four boxset was odd to me, but I guess it was because of production and it's just sort of where it got placed.I thought that Razor was interesting, but I wasn't overall thrilled with it. Perhaps, it was because I didn't appreciate it as others may have when they were waiting for more BSG to air.There were some parts were I really appreciated it, but mostly I just was disgusted with the Pegasus and Cain in general. So, unfortunately I really didn't get a lot out of this purchase. I do think it is necessary for the BSG collection, though maybe that's why it's boxed with Season Four?"
3,Razor-BattleStar Galactica,"This is probably one of the most gloomy excerpts from the series, altho Michelle Forbes is totally outstanding, one of the best actors around. Quite apart from the paranoid delusions of the Captain/Admiral, the atmosphere itself indicates that the ship and its captain are doomed to die, in an occasionally cheerful way, particularly with Admiral Adama as opponent. It is startling and gloomy, but very well done. I would advise being in a very military mood before watching.Linda Sheean"
4,Well worth,"As a fanatic of Battlestar Galactica, I believe Razor is up there with the series. You can also expect the same quality in terms of acting, story and special effects."
3,I got this for my dad...,"It had action and drama well balanced out. But like me, my father dumped the show early.Too much emo!!! Yuck!! To the rest of the show that followed. The last season is a gag a minute emo dripping mess."
1,I Too...,I too downloaded this 88 min episode when Amazon priced it at $1.99. Later I somehow corrupted the file and could not view it. When I called support they said to re-download the episode. Except now Amazon no longer had it up. Now I see they want $15 for the DVD version. I will probably download it if it is encoded with 5.1 dolby. The $1.99 version was stereo. But I will have a bad taste with all that is happening with Studios and Writers strike. Edit. I see it is in STEREO. No I will not download. The price is just TOO High.
3,Saw this in the theatres,"I saw this in the movie theatre when they did their Special Showing, and to me it was just a long-ish episode.There's one thing that totally explains an otherwise peculiar aspect of the Pegasus progression, one line that makes you sit up and say, ""What?!"", but other than that... it was standard-issue Battlestar. Of course, standard-issue Battlestar is better than almost everything else on TV, but with the hype, the theatre screenings, i had hoped for so much more.While on the one hand i hope the extended scenes expand Razor into an amazing bridge from season 3 or 4, on the other i'm a little angsty that i waited in line for the special screening only to find out that we, the hardcore fans, were only being shown a castrated version of the actual story."
1,5 star movie,"Gets one star for Adama's use of the epithet ""c0cksucker"". Frak you, h0m0ph0bic authors. Sure, the colonies can have homophobia, but even at age 19 or so, Adama would be above that."
4,Don't have to be a fan to like this movie,"Even if you are not a Battlestar Galactica fan you will enjoy this movie. While not the best acted the story opens up alot of the past history in the series. The CGI is also well done as is the new update on the apperance of the ""old model"" cylons from the original series."
5,Great Movie,"I highly recommend getting this dvd if you are a BSG fan. The clips you didn't see in the on air version help a bit. Especially towards the end you hear more prophecy from the hybrid, which I personally loved hearing. It gives the viewer more that the characters in the series don't know."
5,thought provoking SF,"Razor tells the story of the Pegasus before it meet the Galactica. I really enjoyed this film because of the moral ambiguity of the characters. The crew of the Pegasus do some pretty horrible things to survive. The audience may not agree with their actions, but they will understand them. Plus, Razor gives a hint of what may come next season, which I hope to be watching soon!"
4,RAZOR is a cut above for a side movie .,this was really a brilliant idea.its brilliantly done also.how does a crew get to where it got too.its not just plot device.
2,Disappointing,"BSG is excellent but Razor is a bad made for TV movie. The three minute webisodes before season three on scifi.com are better. I just saw it in a theater in Seattle. Much of the movie is a montage of people walking to martial music. Characters blatantly contradict themselves - at one point in Razor Adm. Odama says he's not sure he can blame Adm. Cain for making ""hard choices"" while in command. She ordered needless torture that yielded no material benefit. That's flat out wrong, and Adm. Odama has previously said so. The second telling of the Cylon attacks is a poor shadow of the miniseries, which I could watch over and over again. The series main characters mostly play background roles, except for Lee and Starbuck. Roslin has her contractual minimum number of lines. The new Lt. Shaw character they introduce is flat and doesn't have time to develop. I just canceled my pre-order for this."
2,Disappointing,"Very dissappointing. After waiting so long for more Battlestar, which is the best series on TV, Razor left a lot to be desired. Uneven pacing, disjointed story-telling, and none of the new characters were very interesting. Wait until this is on Sci Fi again and save the $."
5,Two more hours of the best show on television,"I agree with the other reviewers that said it was like two more episodes from season two, rather than a standalone movie--but this is hardly an insult when episodes are as good as they are with BSG.Without spoiling it, Razor does a great job of filling in open spaces in the BSG plot. One gets to see more of the reasons why Cain did what she did, but the writer's aren't trying to excuse her actions as much as they're trying explain them.I'm certainly looking forward to the extended edition."
3,dvd- battlestar galactica,"I bought this as a gift for my son. Although I can't vouch for the quality of the DVD, I can say that the product arrived promply and in good condition."
3,Price markup for the DVD version,This was available as a TV show download for about 24 hours at $1.99. Now the DVD version is 7 times more expensive. The TV studios sure are getting the pricing flexibility they wanted...
1,Don't do it,"On the surface this seems like a thrilling script, but suddenly the plot involves love interests between female leads, etc. Don't do it. just move on."
2,I'm watching this on SciFi Channel right now. One word: Craptacular.,"It's an hour and ten minutes into a two-hour program, and so far, there has been none of the heart-racing, suspenseful, tenterhook moments, or the fascinating character developement that we've all come to expect from this series. It feels like they're trying to throw a bone to all us fans who are impatient for the next season to start. It feels glib and overdone, and a little dumbed-down. They threw in a few scenes here and there with Apollo and Starbuck to make you think you're getting something. Like actual drama and suspense. Alas. Too bad.Here's hoping the extended version has a little more depth and content."
3,How can you review something that hasn't been released?,"It's not out yet. How can you review it? I'm sure it's going to be good, BSG hasn't let me down but seriously people......"
1,Poor conceptualization and execution,"Utter disappointment. I consider myself a fan of this show and had hoped for the coherency we've come to appreciate - this wasn't it. So much jumping through time I was looking for my jump rope! The writers never gave us time in each setting/mini-story to connect or understand what was happening. Unless you live, eat and breath BG, you're likely to be lost in this movie (I gave up after an hour and wished I'd done so earlier). Honestly you're better off buying videos of the seasons than this."
1,Selling stuff twice,"This review is NOT about the series, which I love, but about Univesal questionable marketing decisions.As they did with the 2003, two hours miniseries, Universal shall make money twice out of this. First they'll sell the RAZOR movie as a standalone product, and a year later when they release the 4th season, they'll include it in the package (or in the first package, if they break the season in two as they did with the 3rd season.)I'd rather wait then."
4,Preparation For Season 4,"Although most of the action in this film happens at the start of the current war or the end of the first war, it should not be watched until after seeing the third season.This is mostly a background piece. Through the eyes of a new cast member we see who the Pegasus and its Admiral handled the start of the recent conflict. We also see how the first Cylon war ended through Adama's eyes (mostly).The acting and drama are right up where we have come to expect it with this series. My one question is about the title. A bulky clasp knife is used to illustrate the term razor. Maybe the show was originally going to be called Blade or Knife or Cutting Edge but Razor just didn't fit quite right. There is a spoiler of sorts in the show based on the end of season three that is supposed to make you think differently about season four. Check it out."
5,Awesome Movie!!!! A must for those that love Battlestar Glactica,I really enjoyed this movie. Really put it together seeing a different point of view from the Pegagus. It also meshed up really well with the Glactica. Also kinda of a preview of what's to come of the new season 4 whenever it starts. This is a must have in your Battlestar Glactica collection. You wont regret it....
4,An overall good buy,"This disc contains both the TV cut and the unrated edititon of Battlestar Galactica Razor along with some solid extras.The movie itself is very entertaining and a must for Battlestar fans. It is a solid addition/sidestory to Battlestar but cannot top the overall story arc of the series.It is however not suited to get into this show as a newbie: Knowledge of the first and the second season is necessary, but it can be watched without having to know season three (the movie is set somewhere close to the end of season two) This is also good since the third season really takes its time to be released in the US. There will however be some light spoilers of season three near the end of the movie and in the extras.The DVD is a very rounded set and in any case a great buy. So why only 4 stars out of five? While there is nothing to complain about the content, the video quality while not really bad could be -by DVD standards- really sharper and less grainy."
3,Way Over Hyped,"The way SciFi channel promoted this you would think that the show was going too blow away all previous Galactica episodes. In fact it was about as good as your average Galactica episode and revealed just about as much, unfortunetly most Galactica fans are so starved for new stuff that this is like feeding a starving man a hamburger, filling, but not the Steak most of us where looking for.The Producers and Directors of Galactica have lost all respect for the Fans, there is no other show that would dare take this kind of 1 year break! It shows that they feel they can treat the Fans in any manor that they see fit and you guys will still tune in when the time comes. Galactica is not nearly that good and they are going to realize this by the drop in viewership that will come in 2008."
3,Good?,"I am actually a fan of the Star Trek and Firefly series, but decided it was time to watch something of the Battlestar Galactica genre, so I began with the first episode and worked up to this two part movie. Um. Okay. I'm sure had I watched it before ever falling for the crews of Voyager and Serenity, I would have loved it. As it stands, it has good special effects, believable characters and a healthy dose of space-battle action. On the other hand, the plots and characters are just not complex enough for this adult."
2,No surprises,"I like battlestar galactica and I bought every single DVD that was released. This one however is a disappointment. In a straight track chapter the plot is usually complex, leading somewhere, and the characters seldom follow the most obvious path. Razor is an extension on pegasus story which is re-digested, off the main course, and putting more visuals on plots that we know already. There are no real surprises, and even though it is will played and directed it is hard to hard to jump up and down on a ""re-run"". It is like buying a whole DVD just for the extra features (and no feature presentation)."
2,Disappointing,"I am a great 'Battlestar Galactica' fan and anticipated this movie. However, it is unnecessarily gruesome and graphic. The writing isn't that amazing either. Oh well."
2,"Battlestar Galctica ""Razor""","I didn't find the special FX to be of high quality. The show itself wasn't too bad. Recently I witnessed several adds for the show on TV; I thought it looked pretty interesting, but I must say it wasn't as good as I expected. I'm not saying the movie was a flop, but I really had nothing to compare it to. I haven't watched the TV series and unfortunately I don't think I will."
1,Lost interest,Sick and tired of these marketing gimmicks for TV Shows. Wife and I were really anxious to watch season 3 after getting hooked on back copies of the series this summer. Now we just don't care and will make a point of not watching the remainder of the series. What a waste.
3,Sci-fi Addit,"Well if this is an HD DVD I can understand the pricing, the trailers look great and it may seems to have more action than the series. I think that this will provide some additional information that is needed to understand season four. I love this series thats what I may be adding it to my collection."
5,BSG ROCKS!,A filler for the main seasonal episodes this episode answers some underlyeing questions anyone may have had about the appearance of the Battlestar Pegasus and her commander and crew.
3,DVD Problem,"I love BSG, but there is something odd about this DVD. I checked it against the aired version, and there are missing scenes on the DVD, most notably, the scene with young Adama fighting around the ice planet 40 years before the present events. The DVD goes straight to the young Adama in the cylon lab/torture chamber and completely omits the fight scene in orbit and in the atmosphere.Could be a problem with my particular DVD, but I notice that the disk itself does not say its extended, only the box. Maybe I just got a mixup. Would really love to know what happened.Its still a great movie, though."
3,Enjoyable if you are a fan,"This is an enjoyable movie if you are a BSG fan imo. Remains a bit dark, like most of the series and so does not leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling."
2,BSG Razor,"I was not overly impressed with this film. It was not that exciting on TV and there wasn't a lot of ""extension"" on the video. I think it was just an excuse to bring the female admiral back on...and she wasn't a very interesting character to begin with...just sadistic."
3,$14.99 for a 2 hour TV show?,"I haven't seen this yet, but other BSG fans have expressed their approval. I can't believe that it's priced as a FL movie. That'soutrageous! This shouldn't have a higher price than any of theother episodes, except for the fact that it's really two episodes in length. I suppose I'm gonna have to pass on seeing this one."
2,OVERPRICED,"Our family loves Battlestar. We don't have cable, and last year we watched it by buying the episodes on iTunes.Now the addlebrained bozo running the network / studio thinks we are going to pay $15 to download in a format that we cannot play on our iPods?Right.This one we may rent from Netflicks, but downloading at this price -- no way. Sorry Unbox."
4,razor,"I bought the movie ""Razor"" at the same time I bought ""Battlestar Galactica,the complete series"".""Razor"" is included in the complete set.So now I have two.Now,on to the movie.It's just like the series,well written,well acted and just as entertaining as the series is.I think even if you haven't seen any of the series you would be able to enjoy this movie.You don't have to know the series to follow what's going on in the movie."
2,Could have been much better,"Disappointing camera work and film quality - more like what you'd expect if you're viewing the deleted scenes part of a DVD. Not well acted. But if you're enjoying the series, you're probably going to get stuck with this low-quality piece of gosa."
4,"Dark, disturbing, powerful","Razor has a complex cast and story. An aspiring political heiress thrust into a mortal struggle she has trained for, but is not prepared for is the central character. Her flashbacks to the begining of the war between humans and cylons and her experiences as a junior officer aboard a ship commanded by an obsessed admiral form about half the story. Admiral Adama runs into things from his past, and must resolve the threat they represent, so he too has some of his history expanded on. The final operation to overcome this threat is audacious and places the most volitile personalities along side each other.This movie addresses a lot of dark issues of survival, motivations, and gives greater depth to many of the characters in the series. And despite the disturbing nature of many of the themes and scenes, it is powerful and darkly facinating.Enjoyable isn't the right word, but it is compelling.E.M. Van Court"
3,"Interesting story addition to the universe, bad picture quality!","I really enjoyed the story, it added the the BSG complexity, but this dvd picture is absolutely horrible IMHO. I was hopeing for a nice crisp picture, but it was very grainy and looked like a VHS from 1985. Don't get me wrong, the F/X were great, but the picture quality looked like BSG: TOS."
1,Big disappointment,"As a casual fan of PM5k, I was really disappointed in this. You get the videos, which is cool, some solid live footage, and a bunch of goofing on their fans. There are also some footage of fans who sent in videos of themselves which are pretty pointless and bad. Absolutely no in depth interview footage of how the band operates. Some studio footage would have been cool. After watching it 1x I sold it on Ebay. The highlight of the entire dvd is when Satyr from Satyricon says that PM5K are a ""bunch of hillbillies that play loud , aggressive music""."
2,Not bad the first time you watch it,"I bought this movie on vhs (...)and i was highly disapointed. All it was stupid fans with (...) vidos of them selfs and (...)little sounds. They have all the videos which is pretty cool and some good live songs. But alot of it is from japan, which is cool and all but then they have the japanesses videos of fans. I am not being discriminatory but you dont have a clue what they saying. There is a cool video bio of the band but it is narorated by a alien voice(which is real hard to understand). Anything the band members talked the vocies were altered beyond the point of understanding. There was no interviews or studio footage. Throuout this video it would have been nice to here spider 1 or al 3 to acually say a comperhendable word.This video is wackIf u r a hardcore fan go and cop this but if u r just intrested about them buy tonight the stars revolt because u are not missing much with this video"
3,"Stupid, funny entertaining",What more can I say? This is the sort of DVD that you can leave running while entertaining etc. It'd be great in a motorcycle retail shop etc. Fun plus.
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this DVD. It may look new and be a DVD, but it is quite old, and the commentator is boring, almost unprofessional. There is very little variety in the crashes and it only runs for one hour. Definitely not worth the same money as other DVD's with much more material. With how old this recording is, it should sell for $5 at the most."
5,short album but great,well first off this album is only twelve tracks so i wasnt expecting much. but i was wrong. eleven of the 12 tracks are hot. some other reviews said they need to flow better but it just neef that needs some work. chris is on his way to greatness.top 5beefthe knock is thereset it offdont stop (YG party)grown man part 2
3,Yall Could Of Came Hotter Fam,"Dis lp wasnt a bad cd at all very far from being trash. It was disapointing dat my boys chris and neef didnt come back harder on dis sophmore album. ""Tough Luv"" was a very good cd, gunners came out with all tha pistols for dat one but dis they liked packed couple of dem back on tha shelf. Dont get me wrong now they have a few bangers on here like ""This Is The Life"" and ""Beef"" produced by my boy Swizz but still came off a lil short. The rapping wasnt tha problem for the gunners but tha lack of songs and the quality of tha beats on sum of dem jus fell off a lil bit. Overall its a good cd go coap it I did its not a waste of money but then again its not like a classic but still hot.Fav SongsBeefThe LifeKnock Is ThereWay It GoesSame Sh*t Different Day"
3,young gunz,this cd is all right . there song set it off is all right but i think i wasted my 15 dollars i should have bootlegged it gd it
3,a bit disappointed,"First off let me go ahead and let you all know that i am a big-time gunna fan, but in the same breath i have to be truthful and say that this album was a disappiontment. For one this the album only had 12 tracks and you would think that those 12 tracks would be straight fire. The production was very sub par, Tough Luvs production was ten times better than this one. They didn't come hard enouhg unfortunately. I gotta give it a 5/10. Tough Luv was such a good album to me and i still listen to that album on the regular, and i was expecting so much more and i was left without being satified cus i hyped this album so much."
3,Expected a lot more...,"After listening to a copy of Tough Luv that a friend had given me, I was anxiously awaiting this cd. It came out the same day as Common's, so I picked them both up. Man, I was dissapointed. This cd definitely has its high points. Set It off, The Roc is Here, Don't Keep Me Waiting, and Party Tonight are all great songs. However, the production is very sprawling and the ryhmes aren't always the greatest. The cd sounds a lot like a mixtape, and could have been a lot better. I would recommend this if you liked Tough Luv and want to see a different side of the Young Gunz, but other than that, stick with Tough Luv."
4,Young Gunz don't have all their gunz out,"This cd is good. But not amazing. A few good songs here and their. Its kinda like a mixtape with the little chorus'. If you are a fan of Young Gunz then get this album. If you are a fan of Mobb Deep, Memphis Bleek, Common or Nas then u should also get this album."
3,Not his usual self,This is definitely not on par with his Tchaikovsky's 5th played with the same orchestra (which was truly outstanding). Mariss Jansons and the Oslo Philharmonic is dificult to beat.
3,"Good resource, but paper could be better quality","This is a good resource, as it provides good detail at street name level, which most other local maps don't provide.However the paper quality this is printed on is not great, the paper is quite thin and with heavy use, I can imagine the pages becoming creased or torn. This needs to be printed on thicker or tear proof paper.Also this is a heavy book and therefore not easy to carry around. The map continuation is not logical, if you are following a road which goes off the page, it is not followed on in a logical sequence, so you have to flip quite a number of pages to get to the same place and I think some detail is lost between the middle bindings and edges of pages."
5,Incredibly accurate and useful,"I use the Thomas Guide every day to navigate my emergency ambulance to calls, and it's never failed me. It is extremely accurate and easy-to-use, just look up the street name in the back and match it to the grid on the map page. The only downside to this product is that it does not always give complete mapping within gated communities, although it usually will (the roads are never missing, only occasionally their labels). Otherwise, perfect, and WAY cheaper than GPS."
5,PLAY AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE IS DA BEST!!!!,"Play's new album ""Play Around the Christmas Tree"" is the best the group PLAY has come out with! Their voices have a magical blend with the Christmas songs. It really puts you into the holiday spirit! I luv all the songs but I especially like ""All I Want for Christmas is You."" If you don't have the CD, GO AND BUY IT!!!! For you and your friends. This isn't a statement this is a command!"
3,Good Or Bad?,"I have been a Play fan since I stumbled upon their first single. I have eagerly gotten each of their new albums the day they were released, and the only reason why I started to forget about this girl group was when Faye left and I listened to their 3rd album (The first one with new singer Janet instead of Faye) No offense to Janet, I am sure you are a great performer, but I miss Faye! And it seems like since she has gone, the singers are trying to over-compensate for her absence. My honest opinion is that this is a cheesy christmas album with over-sung vocals and unless your favorite play album is their latest ""Don't Stop The Music"" then you won't like this album. Play's only hope? Faye, come back!"
5,Could've Been Better,"This is a perfect buy for all Play fans to get into the Christmas spirit.Overall vocals are good, but it is way to obvious that the girls were sick during recording. Background vocals drown out the lead vocals on some songs. The music sounds too computerized. Some arrangments were too rushed, and the girls' Swedish accents could've been fixed. The cover of this album doesn't show much Christmas spirit. It most likely was an outtake from a previous photoshoot. This album was obviously rushed, seeing as Play was at the end of their pop stardom.The high points of this album are Janet's amazing vocal on ""Oh Holy Night"" and ""Silent Night"". Their remake of Mariah Carey's ""All I Want For Christmas Is You"" is almost perfect."
5,OMIGOSH,this cd is the best in the world! all playfans should buy it! even though fayes not in it! <-thats unbelievable!buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love play!!!!!!
5,GREAT SERIES,"I wish this series was still on the air. Unlike much of today's programming for children, this series was warm, positive, entertaining and wonderfully informative. I, too, wish there were more Stanley DVD's."
4,Did anyone read the publishing date?,"I read the other reviews with interest. They all complained about the author's writing style being weak, etc. If they had bothered to check, they would have seen that this was originally published in 1990 as a Loveswept paperback. Loveswepts are not known for their brilliant mysteries, just plenty of brooding romance. This is how Ms. Johansen started her writing career and she's only progressed brilliantly since then. Personally, I'd love to see her return to the Sedikan series in the future, they were some of my favorites of her works.So quit bellyaching and read this as it was meant - a delicious romance to be consumed in one sitting."
3,could have been better,"I usually love Johansen's books, but this one wasn't up to her normal standards in my opinion. The basic story is Daisy, the heroine, is an incredible singer, and is heard by our hero, Jason. Jason decides he must cast her as the lead in his next production, and goes about doing everything he can to sign her. At the same time, he is trying to get her into bed. However, he has a horrible secret from his past that threatens to break up the two.That is the basic idea, and in my opinion, Jason just wasn't that great of a hero. I have to admit I liked Daisy must more than Jason. Jason was a very alpha male until the treat was revealed and then he turned into a martyr. Daisy was the one who stepped up to the plate and took care of the problem. I like strong heroines, but the hero doesn't have to be a big baby either.Anyway, my personal opinion is that this book was lacking compared to others written by Johansen. However, it wasn't the worst book I have read."
2,An Unexpected Song,"Not the usual Johansen tale. It should have been billed as a ""Love Story."" I'm into the 3rd (out of 4) disc, and no suspense fill activity, yet. And She is one of my favorites, for exciting suspense. Please, leave this style to the romance writers. where, oh where was Eve Duncan and the gang?"
2,Condition not as listed,"The book was listed as ""Good Condition"", the book I received was yellowed, stained and old."
2,A never ending story about the woes of being female,This entire novel is an excuse to complain about how hard it is to be a women. Her writing is weak and does not capture your interest. This novel should not be called a classic!
1,like oh my god!!!!!!!!,This album is like totally like totally cool oh my god i can't believe how cool winger is my god i love winger oh my god they are so cool oh my god they helped me with my constipation problem when i was down in the dumps...no pun inteded like totally awesomw oh my god yes!!!anyways this album blows.
4,All this stuff is classic anymore....,"You've come this far, now go and just buy the CD....You've faded into nineties glam rock nostalgia, and you've gone past the good bands (Queensryche, Cinderella) and the people with some staying power (Guns n' Roses and Metallica) and are getting soft and sentimental for what? Guys in tight pants and makeup.What I'm saying is that if you're on this page, go ahead and do it. Splurge. Buy the CD. It's going to make you happy....You can think of fairytales and hoodwinks and of the time you got drunk and hooked up with Kip Winger.... ""he's such a sweetie""...You silly Winger fans...."
3,A satisfactory piece of music.,"This debut from Winger isn't bad. None of the songs are that original, but the songwriting and playing are respectable. A few of the songs have good energy, but a lot of the material is forgettable also. I think that the two ballads (""Without the Night"" and ""Headed for a Heartbreak"") are the most impressive ones. Songs like ""Poison Angel"" and ""Higher and Higher"" aren't memorable at all to me. Winger is decent on this debut, but the direction of the album is too generic. Kip Winger's vocals are okay though and he has a voice all his own. Reb Beach is undoubtedly a talented guitar player also. This first album from Winger isn't a personal favorite, but it's still listenable."
3,Still got some kick left in it!!,"Yes this is '80's cheeze metal at its best!! Most of the CD I have trouble listening to with out laughing my butt of!! Still over all if you want to remember the state of music in 1989, pull this out and jamm."
3,Better than anything Warrant ever did,"That's about all I can say about this disk. 'Madalaine' is a great song, even though I like to substitute 'Marilyn' when I'm singing along to it. 'She's only 17' was the big single that is silly, but good time stuff. The rest of the record is poser/hair rock stuff that the girls go crazy over, but Jimi is still rolling in his grave over the Purple Haze disaster. My garage bands have covered it better, but we had better sense not to ever record 'the dead god'."
3,This is album is pretty good to be fair.,"I went back and listened to this album for the first time in about nine years, and I was surprised how good it sounded. Reb Beach guitar sound and playing is excellent. Rob Morgensterns drumming is top notch. The band gets slammed for being a pretty boy outfit but they can play. The big misstep here is purple haze but just skip it. Beau Hill's production is outstanding. So if you want pick up a good pop/metal album you cant go wrong here."
3,The one review I don't want to write,"Of the 3 albums that we currently have from the band Winger, this is really not the place to start. Pull is worlds better and In the Heart of the Young also has it over this 1988 debut. The problem here is that there is just way too much filler considering the talent of the band. While songs like Hungry and Headed for a Heartbreak are top notch tunes, the other 9 tracks are below par for the most part. Without the Night is a genric ballad if there ever was one. Seventeen is pure cheese and higher and higher was a bonus track for good reason, it is plain bad. Poison Angel, State of Ememgencey and the cover of the Hendrix classic Purple Haze have some really good guitar work.Overall, I think that this band had way more talent and showed it on future releases.If you are a guitar fan, pick it up for Reb Beech's work. If you are looking for a solid record from a great band from this era, go and get yourself Badlands S/T or Queensryche - Empire"
5,"Wow, these guys RRROOOCCKKK!","The best album ever! Real Heavy Metal, my favorite CD for Headbanging. We were listening to ""Headed for a Heartbreak"" when I first dated my girlfriend, that's why this is a very special song to us. A definite 5-Star-Album, Aggressive Buy!"
4,From Denver club scene to MTV in less than ten years,"One of my most interesting LPs is Thunder on the Mountain. Recorded at Denver's Rainbow Music Hall in 1979, the album features songs from nine of the area's best rock bands, one of which is Winger (then known as ""Colorado""). ""Madelaine,"" like Tesla's ""Modern Day Cowboy,"" reminds me of nights on Longmont's Main Street (my 15 minutes of stardom), while any talk of Winger always prompts two questions: First, how did a Colorado boy named Kip get from the Denver club scene to MTV in less than ten years? And, second, how did the Kipper get Dixie Dregs drummer Rod Morgenstein into his heavy metal band? Both are tales I'd like to hear."
5,Great overall album,"This album is worth it just for the ballads: ""Headed for a Heartbreak"" and ""Without the Night,"" which are both very powerful songs. I think ""Headed for a Heartbreak"" is one of the best songs to come out of the 80's. ""Madalaine"" and ""Seventeen"" will pump you up as well. All the songs are good with the exception of Purple Haze which is aweful. That makes 10/11 songs good, with a few being excellent as mentioned above."
4,Great classic '80s hair metal CD,"As far as hair metal CD's go, this one is by far a softee. Reb Beach (now with Dokken!) puts out some great tunes on his guitar, and the vocals are superb. Songs like ""Hungry"" and ""Time to Surrender"" make this CD a keeper. The sound of the CD (both the vocals and guitar) reminds me of a cross between Van Halen and Ratt... a great combination! If you're a fan of classic '80s rock, definately check out this CD!! If you're a fan of Dokken's new material, also check out this CD to hear some of Reb Beach's great earlier work (he does background vocals too!)!"
5,Sparkling and sensitive Schubert,"The Schubert 5th is the most popular of his early symphonies. And for good reason, the work is a masterpiece, especially the gorgeous slow movement. Unfortunately, most conductors play this piece too harshly. They play it too fast or too loud or too dramatically. The work should sound totally natural. It is not easy to get it just right. The conductor here manages to do it and this is a wonderful performance, as is the longer but less inspired 6th symphony. Well worth the Amazon Marketplace price."
2,OK For A Woman,"This is a book written by women - for women - almost all of the examples and people profiled are women - they even go so far as to quote a writer page 235 co-auther Jennifer) as saying, ""Sometimes it bores me - why I am pigeonholed into looking at things from a woman's point of view all the time?"" One gets the feeling that this collaboration was done by a few ladies sipping espresso for the purposes of marketing themselves and hoping to garnish more freelance work in the process. Some of the chapters are useful - if you are a woman and want to write about women's issues - but the areas where they deal with non-women-focused interviews, quotes and advice seem as they were thrown in as an after-thought - somewhat as if the manuscript was finished and the editors commented that they needed SOMETHING for SOMEBODY who isn't a feminist."
4,Great flavor,"I really like red tea, and this one has great flavor, like Earl Gray, only better! No caffeine."
2,Zzzzzzzzz,"What can I say? Whereas I am a fan of erotica or ""romantica"", I'm just not sold on vampires. So with the alpha male hero of this story being a Russian born, blood slurping, fanged, sex-fiend...well, it didn't do it for me. Generally speaking, the passionate scenes were mediocre at best, the characters were just unlikeable (main and supporting), and the story itself was boring. All the Russian pet names liberally used throughout became increasingly annoying as well. I know there are better books in this genre to be read, and I intend to find them!"
2,Not worth it,"I bought this book based on the other five star reviews, but I wished I had saved my money. The book had a cute premise with Regina's friends setting her up with her fantasy, but those friends quickly became annoying. They lost control of the fantasy fix when Regina met Dimitri at a club and left with him. The friends resented that and harrassed the main characters for the rest of the book. Additionally, there was too much of the mental dialogue and on Regina's side it was often written for laughs, or smiles, but fell flat. I couldn't understand why someone like Dimitri would take a second look at her after listening in on her mean spirited thoughts at the club. I was more than tired of Regina's immaturity by the time the book was finished. The sex scenes were disappointing if you've read more than one book in this genre and overall they were hurt by the lack of chemistry and the unlikeable heroine."
2,Disappointed,This didn't grow for me at all and I followed the instructions exactly. Better off just buying the already grown plant.
2,toooo strong to use.,"they advertised the smell to be ""light baby power fragrance"". this is more like a heavy-heavy strong power fragrance. the fragrance to toooo strong for me to use."
3,Body Drench Mango,Smells great but not thick enough. I had a lot of trouble spilling the lotion before I could put it on because it would run out of my hand.
5,"Great Product, Clean fragrance",Love it. Not greasy and yet good coverage and moisturizing. Great clean fragrance.
5,Love this lotion,"I have always loved Body Drench. It makes my skin very soft. Even though it's toted as an indoor tanning lotion, I use it as a regular lotion. The Sugar Cane is a great scent for around Christmas time."
2,drench body lotion,Normally I love the lotion. I don't remember ordering unscented but when my order arrived that is what I got. Tried to call the company back that it came from but they would not correct the problem Definitely will not order from them again.
1,Save your money,"I fortunately bought this DVD for less than $20 during a financial website's sale. Unfortunately, it was still not worth the money. The DVD description itself is highly misleading, as the only chart pattern mentioned is an ascending triangle and that's only in passing. The DVD is exclusively about intermarket relationships and sadly has no insightful information there, either. Anything to be learned from this DVD can be learned by doing a Google search on ""intermarket relationships gold bonds stocks"". A disgrace that someone as esteemed as John Murphy is selling this weak content, and even more disgraceful that he is selling it at this price."
3,Going back to chewables,"The pills are quite big, so if you have a problem with big pills, these aren't for you. I like the chewables MUCH better. I'm switching back."
3,Somewhat pleased,"Love the series but was very disappointed that it contained only 4 episodes - where are the others from the season? I felt cheated, and the price was no longer a bargain."
3,I loved the book but the movie......,They killed off Joe's husband so she could have a romance? Oh sure no problem.NOT! Also I missed Meg's kids being in the story.Oh yeah and Joe's other son. The acting wasnt the best either. If you are looking for a movie that will bring the book you read to life do not count on this movie.
2,Bummer,"I thought it was a rip off. $27 for 4 episodes. It was misleading. I like the other guy thought I was getting season 1 & 2. I got both sets. I also, had I known would not have gotten them. Netflix has both seasons to watch straight away, and amazon doesn't provide the full DVD's of both seasons. Disappointed in Johns Island, S.C."
1,Based on Little Men?,"I couldn't believe how much they deviated from Louisa May Alcott's characters and story line. To begin with, Jo was not a widow! Her husband was a very important character and a big part of the school. Meg's two older children, twins, Demi and Daisy attended Plumfield. There was no measles epidemic, no child died in their care. Amy and Laurie's daughter, Bess, was 3 years old and never attended Plumfield, but when she visited the kids adored her because she was so sweet and beautiful. There were enough interesting plots in the book to draw from without making such huge changes. The love story between Jo and her husband was actually very interesting. They could have done flashbacks to how they met. It was a shame to leave out the example of a beautiful, lasting marriage just for the sake of making a possible love interest out of a handyman. It lost the point that some of the kids who didn't have parents found new ""parents"" at Plumfield. They cheapened and dumbed down the story."
2,To short for the price/only 4 episodes,"I was disappointed in the CD set. I spent $49.00 on a used set and only got 4 episodes. The episodes were good, but I was disappointed that there were not more episodes for the LARGE cost of the CD's. Plus I thought it was at least two seasons since the cost was so high!!Largely disappointed!!Mary Jo Nelson"
5,Reach For The Sky-Classic Ratt Rock!,If you like Ratt then you'll love this classic Ratt album.One of the first six albums by the original Ratt. All tracks are pure Ratt-N-Roll.
3,Pure RATT,"Don't let the bizarre imagery of this album's cover fool you; Ratt haven't gone transcendental on us or anything. The music behind the cover is still filled with tons o' Ratt-styled sleeze, for which they are world famous. This album came out in '88, and it's easily one of their top three recordings. Songs like ""City to City,"" ""Way Cool Jr."" and ""What I'm After"" jam dirty and hard. Pure RATT! I used to groove hard to this tape when I was in high school, but I doubt high school kids today listen to such stuff. Nowadays it's Limp Bizkit and Staind.Well, hope this review has helped.Catch ya' on the flipside..."
4,One of the better Ratt albums,"Ratt put out three very good CD's and this is one of them. Along with ""Out Of The Cellar"" and ""Detonator"", REACH FOR THE SKY has a musical quality that most hard rock bands can't produce."
3,In the history of Rock n Roll....,"....this is easily one of the worst album covers ever. I mean look at this thing, what the heck is it? Anyway, Way Cool Jr. and I Want a Woman were great tunes. This album did have a heavy share of filler though. Out of the Cellar is still their all around best and tightest album."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"Sorry, but I can't agree with the others on this one. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Ratt. They were (and still are) one of my favorite bands, but this album is weak. I saw the video for Way Cool Jr. and went right out and bought this album. Sadly, that is the only real good song on here. Some of the other songs are ok at best. Ratt picked it back up on Detonator. If you have never really listened to Ratt, buy 8191, Detonator, or Out of the Cellar. Leave this one for the bargain bin."
2,"2 1/2, This is where Ratt starts to lose some steam","Ratt was one of my favorite west coast metal bands of the 1980's. Even with the pop hits such as Round and Round, Slip of the Lip, Dance, and Lay it Down, they still had a certain edge to them, which sorted them from the cheesey hair metal bands such as Winger, Poison, and White Lion, just to name a few. The Hair metal scene was beginning just starting to peak in 1988, and this is where Ratt seemed to cross over to a more toned down, and much more corney sound. Gone where the edge of such songs as ""I'm Insane, ""Between the Eyes"", and ""7th Avenue"", Ratt begins to lose their signiture sound. There are some bright spots on this album such as ""City to City"", ""Way Cool Jr."" ""Chain Reaction"" and ""Bottom Line"" but the rest is nothing more then listening to a glorified Poison or White Lion album. But then again its not ""Detonator"" ENjoy"
2,This is where they lost me,"I had been a fan of this band from the EP, but this release changed my attitude. The pop overtones that began to leak from Dancing Undercover really come to the forefront. Perhaps it was the polished production, or the poppy chorus to 'I Want a Woman.' And although their musicianship became clear with the bluesy 'Way Cool Jr' that song was just too much of a departure for my taste. Otherwise, nothing stands out on this album- all the other songs had the same tone and there was no variation to Pearcy's vocal range- not that he ever had range. Same old, same old. I longed for the heavy stuff like ""Wanted Man"" or ""You're In Love"", but there is none of that on this album. They were clearly out for radio play here, and it shows badly. More Warrant than Megadeth- a bad move."
2,Too simple for a band like Ratt !!!,"I really liked the opening track ""City to city"" but that was it !!! Almost every song seems to be so plain and it is hard to tell the difference. I prefer ""Detonator"" album which is more powerful with stronger beats and melody. However I am still looking forward to their reunion."
4,Reach for The Sky,"This Ratt album entitled reach for the sky had about three songs I thought were definately good. The rest of the album seems to lack the same input that the three good songs have. Is it a terrible album? No, but certainly not RATT at their finest. If you are a true RATT afficionado, then add this to your library."
3,"Good Ratt N Roll, yes it's worth owning","Reach For The Sky is a good Ratt album. If you like this band, or are into other similar bands like Dokken or Motley Crue, Poison or Quiet Riot, this should be right up your alley. While I don't think this is Ratt's best album, it does contain some of Warren DeMartini's best guitar solos. Warren flat-out RIPS on a lot of these guitar lines, very cool stuff. If you own the first three Ratts (EP, OOTC, and IOYP) this would be a good purchase, especially if you can get it used for just a few bucks. Standout tracks: City To City, I Want A Woman, Way Cool Jr, Chain Reaction, No Surprise, What I'm After."
4,THE STATE HOUSE,"In this era of fragile economic world structure and personal insecurity, the story of a thirty seven year old rising star who becomes the CEO of a major utility company should be fascinating reading for all men and women in the business world.The novel involves male and female executives struggling to get to the top while the Governor of the state and an aging Lobbyist solve a murder as their last hurrah.THE STATE HOUSE is book three of the trilogy. The author was the executive director of ""The Committee For Lower Utility Bills"" and brings back the fear, anger, and confusion of the utility executives and their customers during the years when nuclear plants were being built in America. Huge Holding companies were formed to raise the capital for the very expensive nuclear plants. The schism created by the new breed of holding company executives and old time utility men took many years to heal.This book is fascinating reading.Dori"
3,This book was OK.,"This book was OK. There are a lot of books on this subject and I feel like I've read almost all of them. The following book, however, did it for me. Interesting and concise. Just passing it along.What Did Jesus Really Say-How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information] by Peter Cayce"
4,The Five Gospels,As a religion major I found the five gospels to be quite interesting. This book takes the gospels and helps to identify stories and takes story by story to help you understand.
4,Book is useful but the arithmetic is terrible,"This translation of the five gospels is very useful for study, and the colors are an interesting guide to the opinions of the committee. However, I wonder how Robert Funk got through high school math. He classifies several sayings as Black, when the consensus of the Fellows was clearly for a Gray rating. And the Seminar continues to use a faulty algorithm. There is no truth set, independent of the five manuscripts themselves, from which the Fellows or any of us can educate ourselves to become true experts."
5,The Truth about Jesus,"Although some Christians will quarrel with the scholars who collaborated to write this book, it is well researched and illustrates how little of what Jesus said is historically likely. Few people are truly cognizant of how, when and to what purposes the New Testament Gospels were written."
5,"Intelligent, invigorating, liberating.","Groundbreaking attempt to clean off two thousand years of plankton. If there are those that disagree with apects of the methodology, that's reasonable. But at least we finally have an ATTEMPT to present a multi-dimensional view of the flawed text that has come down to us. I am persuaded that there are textual problems with the traditional Gospels; they are not what they seem. I welcome honest and well-informed attempts to bring them into better focus."
1,THE JESUS SEMINAR,"A warning from the Jesus Seminar is ""Beware of finding a Jesus entirely congenial to you."" They warn against attempting ""to marshal the facts to support preconceived convictions"" in order to ""create a Jesus in our own image."" This warning is labeled the ""final general rule of evidence."" Considering the hermeneutical postulates that the Jesus Seminar brings to the Gospels by way of the seven pillars of scholarly wisdom, which it would seem impossible to deny is a body of preconceived convictions, this warning seems misplaced. The Jesus Seminar is in danger, despite their attempt to announce their findings through the public media, of becoming irrelevant, if they have not already become so, because of a fatal flaw: not heeding their own warning."
1,Do not waste your time on this book!,"I wouldn't waste my time reading the book by Funk. However, if anyone is interested in what Jesus really said, then I would highly recommend reading ""What did Jesus Really Say?"" by Misha'al ibn Abdullah. It ISBN number is 1888782099."
1,Total Sham,The whole book is built on the assumption that a group of scholarly people can determine what Jesus said by group consensus. Just because a majority vote in favor of something doesn't make it true. This maybe an over simplification but that is what it boils down to.
1,Blackballing the words of Jesus,"A committee is an animal with six or more legs and no brain. The Jesus Seminar formed a committee and passed out multi colored balls for the committee members to vote on Jesus' words in accordance with the ""Five Pillars of Scholarly Wisdom"". Red balls meant ""I think Jesus said it"", Black meant ""I don't think Jesus said it"". Pink and Grey indicated varying degrees of uncertainty. One legal ground for invalidating a jury's verdict is that the jury made its decision by lot. The rationale for this legal requirement is that such decisions are highly suspect, not the product of detached reflection, and very likely wrong-headed. The Jesus Seminar made their decisions in a manner which would rightly be rejected in any court of law in the United States. Having said all this, if you can ignore the hubris and faulty scholarship of the Jesus Seminar, the book itself can be thought provoking and interesting."
5,The Five Gospels,"The Five Gospels is written by professors with expertise in theology and the history of the source texts which made up the Bible. It rates the words which the professors thought that Jesus actually said according to four colour scales. This clarifies the impression of Jesus one can formulate using one's imagination. This book reduces changes and additions to the gospels that may have been introduced with time, whether this was accidental or deliberate. Of course, this viewpoint would contradict that of a number of Christian groups. However, the reader should feel free to judge by themselves. In my opinion, this is a very interesting book written in a very clear style. In other words, it is excellent!"
2,Godawful Translation,"I'm going to ignore all the controversy on whether this group of scholars can actually identify the real words of Jesus and just warn people about the ""translation."" The attempt here was to make what Jesus said 2000 years ago have the same impact on modern readers as it did back then. Assuming Jesus spoke in plain, everyday language, the translators here have filled his teachings with today's slang, even if the nouns in the slang didn't exist in Jesus' time. ""One cannot love God and his checking account."" I'm sorry, ""checking account""??? Is the assumption here that we're too stupid to understand the word ""money""? All the work put into this and they come up with a translation that sounds like it was written for a three year old. I would suggest to the Jesus Seminar that anyone with the interest and patience to wade through the endless analysis in their books does not need a translation made for a young child."
3,autism from the mom perspective,"This book was average - of course the heart of a mom is always good to read about - but there were things in this book that made it drag a bit...overall, though, it was a good book for other moms of children with autism to read."
5,The First Fish DVD!,"I was thrilled to be able to see all the videos Fish made during the early nineties that most of America has never gotten to see. Worth the wait. Fish is excellent. When this item arrived the packing slip had this listed as Kettle of Fish - Artist Unknown. This should be available with all of Fish's stuff. Instead it is just miscellaneously filled under titles with Fish in them. It is not that hard to figure out who the artist is, really. To all Marillion fans, Fish fans, and Progressive Rock Freaks - this is for you! Hope that Fish will soon release some of his live concerts on DVD. Seeing him in concert is an amazing experience. One of the best performers in rock music. America wake up! Buy this! (Also includes an interesting interview where he describes the making of each video)."
3,Digger the dog---average pull toy with sound effects.,"My fifteen month old enjoys the toy (especially the realistic sound effects). However, he gets frustrated when he pulls the leash and Digger sometimes flips over to the side. He still tries to drag it. I believe this is a result of the toy not being not quite heavy enough. I still would recommend it; However, it needs a ring at the top of the leash so that it can be more easily grasped."
5,So great we're buying one for a gift!,"Our youngest son, at 9 months of age, got this as a Christmas present. We also have 2 live dogs, but this one HE can actually ""walk."" We have been happy with his interest in the toy so much so that we are buying one for my husband's boss's youngest boy for his first birthday. We haven't had significant problems with the toy flipping - just be aware that the wheels don't swivel so you can't expect it to have a terrific turning radius. Our son doesn't get frustrated with it and our dogs don't bother the toy either (since it does bark). We've rated it very highly because it is one of his favorite toys, and has been for 6 months now - and we haven't had to change the batteries yet either."
5,Best bang for buck!,"I am incapable of cooking rice on the stove without burning it, but the little microwave rice cookers like this are terrific! My husband and I have a plug-in rice cooker, but I never use it because it's just one more thing to plug in and it takes up too much counter space."
3,Quick but not perfect,"I tried several times, but could never get the fluff of the electric cookers, my boss is a South Indian he refused to eat it- believe me- he knows rice. I however use it since its quik and ez to clean . I recommend putting 1/2 to 1 cup water extra for each cup of rice and microwaving to the middle range of time--not the max recommended time. Also open the bowl as soon as it is done to prevent drying. Overall ok for singles, but rice quality simply absent. Though I use it everyday since it is simple."
1,"Lid Forms Poor Seal, Water Easily Boils Over","A microwave ricer cooker really only serves two purposes: to hold the ingredients, and to keep water from boiling over.The lid on this cooker forms a poor seal with the bowl, allowing starchy water to boil over the sides and spill into your microwave (regardless of the water level).You're better off just using a pyrex bowl covered in plastic to cook your rice."
5,MICROWAVE RICE COCKER,"THIS ITEMS IS WONDERFUL, AFTER I USED, I PUT AWAY MY ELECTRIC RICECOOCKER, I RECOMENDED TO EVERY ONE."
3,Compact and nice -- but it could be better,"It is a nice and compact rice cooker. However, it can cook only upto 1 and half cups of rice properly. Otherwise, the water overflows into the microwave. The lid doesn't shut tightly."
2,microwave rice cooker,this product is very flimsy. Inner cover is difficult to secure. A lot of water escapes during the cooking process.
3,OK rice cooker for smaller amount of rice,"An OK rice cooker for a two people, does not work well for a family. Can really only handle making about 2 cups of rice as any more tends to boil sticky rice water out of the top. The picture makes it looks bigger than it really is in real life."
4,"Pretty but,,,,,","The stools are very pretty. They match my kitchen very nicely, and go with my Powell Island of the same name. HOWEVER, the set screws for the cushion are NOT long enough, and will not hold the cushion onto the stool. You will need longer screws, but be VERY careful not to use ones that are too long, as you WILL feel them thru the cushion. My second complaint is that the pre-drilled holes for the legs, are not quite right, and makes it looks like they have been put on wrong. It does not effect the strength of the stool, but like I said, it just makes them look like they are not put together correctly."
4,A high shool football coach does anything to win a game.,A high school foot ball coach does anything to win a football game until he's team turn's on him. This coach would give his team steroid's to strengthen muscles to be able to play which was illegal. Winning was the onlt thing that matter to him and he could care less ablut his team just as long as they got the job done. I feel like no coach should ever put a high school team through this much stress. It is not right and unfair. If winning means that much to a coach then he should choose a different job. I think that it is not how many games you win or loss. It is all about how hard you play and if you do the very best you can do.
3,"Great Movie, Disappointing Blu-Ray","Varsity Blues is a Great movie. You will totally enjoy it. If, however, you already own it on DVD, you might be disappointed in the Blu-Ray version. It is not as sharp as others I have seen and actually looks grainy up close."
3,Strictly for hunk watchers,"This one rates three stars for the male flesh alone. There's handsome and sensitive James van der Beek, blond and beautiful Paul Walker (what a smile and let's hope he gets his own starring showcase soon), and pure animal Scott McCann (whose streaking scene is just about worth the above video price. Other than that, this is a pretty low-key flick. Gutter humor, cliches, and hyperbolic performances, especially from Jon Voight, doing a reprise, it seems, of his famed Joe Buck role."
5,Awesome,This movie is hilarious as well as dramatic. I recommend this movie to anyone that is in the mood for a great movie. The cast is great and the music makes the movie even better.
5,Great Football Movie,This is by far my favorite movie about football. It is about football players playing in a small town where the dads wished they were still playing and the coach is mean son of a gun that has to get his way. It is very entertaining and and has some funny parts and some serious ones too. BillyBob and Tweeder provide tons of laughs in this movie. James Van Der Beek does a good job in this movie as the backup quarterback that becomes the star starting quarterback when the starter gets hurt. Jon Voigt also does a good job in this movie playing the mean coach. All in all this movie was extremely good with some great football action and some very funny moments.
4,Varsity Blues Review,"It 's beautiful package color. It's a great movie with a lot of special features, tehe sound e imagem was amazing too."
4,Great movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. Bought it for a guy friend who told me I needed to watch it first. It turned out to be so good, I'm going to get another one for myself."
1,varsity blues dvd,The dvd did not play. I even went out and bought a new dvd player and it still did not play.
4,Oldie but a goodie,This movie came out during James Van Der Beek's success on Dawson's Creek. Great movie about a underdor QB in a football town... the pressures of high school football.
4,Husband,"I bought this movie for my husband, he had been asking for it. He wanted it for his collection. He has been able to watch this movie several times and in HD. Thanks for great quality."
4,Great Football Movie,"When I first saw ""Varsity Blues"", I was really hard in judging it. I've grown up around football all my life and now I am a varsity coach, so I can be a harsh judge of all things football.I can admit now after seeing it a few times that it is a fun, exciting, and realistic portrayal of what some towns are like for football.The young actors are very good, the action scenes are second only to ""The Program"" and the comedy is very reminiscent of ""American Pie"" style teen humor. If you just want to rent a fun and enjoyable flick, this is a good bet."
3,So bad it's good.,"This movie almost defines so-bad-it's-good. My friends and I repeatedly watch this movie simply to hear James Van Der Beek's bad Texan accent and his insipid speeches. We constantly quote ""I will not live your life"" to each other. Quite frankly this movie is hilarious for its over the topness. If it weren't for James Van Der Beek, I'm fairly certain this film never would have seen the light of day. It's a shame that the only real value this film has is for camp humor."
2,bull crap,I recently bought this movie because it wasn't on the prime instant video. Paid 9.99 for it. 2 weeks later it was free..wtf thanks for making me pay for it wont be buying any more movies from them
2,Varsity Snooze,"I thought this movie was a snoozer..It got play because of James Van DerBeak of dawsons creek..It was like a few of the teenager movies that all come out at the same time had been rolled up into one..Football, fat kid drinkin syrup, star quarterback hurt, my father doesn't think Im good enough...That sums up the whole film...I gave it a thumbs down..."
2,Dawson gets tackled up the creek,"I know the movie was about something, im just not sure what. Was it a moving story about a team who never gave up and finally triumphed? Or what about the story of a kid who stands up against the evil coach? Or was it about football, beer and strippers? Well, i dont know, but I was really wasn't that impressed with Vanderbeek's portrayl of a high school football player. Maybe thats because he is really about 25 years old."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A forgettable film lifted above scores of similar teen and sports movies only by the hard-R nature of its dialogue and nudity, Varsity Blues can boast a likable James Van Der Beek, a few amusing scenes, and little else."
4,"""Let's Be Heroes""","The '99 film `Varsity Blues' is definitely one of the best high school coming of age-teen angst-sports films within the genre. There are plenty of good ole boy hysteronics and football action to keep the male audience focused, a couple of pretty girls and of course James Van Der Beek and Paul Walker to keep the girls involved. The two keys to this film that set it above other films of this nature is the performance of Jon Voight as the thoroughly unlikable Coach Bud Kilmer and Ron Lester as the big, soft-hearted lineman Billy Bob. If you're looking for something enjoyable and undemanding you could do a lot worse."
3,Mainly vicarious thrills,"The movie is extremely predictable. The second line of the movie is like, ""That would be a disaster if Lance (starting QB) got hurt"", and I'm like, ""Lance is gonna die."" The characters are all extremely one dimensional, that said they are pretty accurate stereotypes because it reminded my a lot of my old team and I've heard other people say the same. The football scenes are probably the best I've seen, though, and the movie mainly offers vicarious thrills to those who want to live through another high school football year. The ending was a stinker.However, in true football movie tradition, the quarterback throwback pass is still unbeatable! Ha!"
2,The hot for teacher song scene is fun,"really not a great showing of what texas high school football is about. But how would I know I only played there, coached there, played college ball there and then played pro baseball in that state but what would I know I just escaped from Taurine and I am trapped inside amazon's website being forced to watch ridiculous nonsense. It is a cool movie if you are a senior in high school but it is so fictional it is funny. Friday night lights is so much better, but if you watch a movie like Gladiator with Russ Crowe then you really get a feel for what it is like to get kicked in the head and eat dirt at the same time."
2,Dawson with a football and accent.,"Varsity Blues starring James Van Der Beek is a pretty lame and vile film. Van Der Beek's acting sounds and looks so fake, don't even get me started with that southern accent he tries to pull off, ugh! Amy Smart and Paul Walker are great and make this film not so unbearable. I am sure a lot of guys like this film for that whipped cream bikni scene with Ali Larter. The dialogue is unforgivable, the movie plays good songs though."
1,No plot whatsoever!,"Are we supposed to like these teen flicks? Me and my friend are both 15 and the movie INSULTED our intelligence! What's the point of having a teacher be a strip tease?? It wasn't neccessary in the plot -- was it supposed to be funny? ('cause it wasn't). And what about the Whipped Cream Girl who wanted to ""leave the little town"". How many times has that plot been used? And the football theme wasn't that interesting. If producers think we like these types of movies, they must think Generation X is really dumb. Lets stick with Roberto Benini!"
4,Exciting and Hillarious,"Whether or not your agree with this movies portrayl of small town football life. The movie's sound track is fast paced, powerful and exciting. The movie is filled with jokes of my types, ranging from subtle one that most will not undertand to obvious ones that practically beat you over the head. Either way this movie is extremely entertaining and a joy to watch"
3,"Good movie, but not enough Paul Walker","Okay, I know this was a James Van Der Beek geared movie, but I wish it had shown more of Paul Walker's character. One of the most interesting things about the story was that Lance and Jonathan were best friends. We never really got to see how these guys actually worked through the strains that were put on their friendship by everything that happened - before and during the movie.Jonathan had been in Lance's shadow for years. Everyone in town worshiped Lance, young and old. Then Jon became the star because Lance got hurt. Lance's girlfriend dropped him and went after Jon. Jon got into Brown Univeristy while Lance's dreams went down the drain. I mean, one trip to the the strip club and everythings okay?Paul Walker is a good actor and could have done great with some meatier scenes and a bigger role. Too bad the director couldn't see that.But that aside, Van Der Beek is good and Jon Voight was perfect as the coach."
3,"Varsity Blues Understands Small Town Life, But Misses Big","Varsity Blues isn't a brilliant film. What it does well is depict the small town obsession with high school sports in a way that few films have done before. Having grown up part of my life in small town America, knowing how the coach of the local team can be often more powerful than the mayor or the police, this is a frightening portrait that touches a real nerve.The story itself, the acting, etc. -- those things are unremarkable. It makes sense that another movie, Friday Night Lights, is reattempting the story of a small town football team, because Varsity Blues doesn't quite nail the whole package.In any event, it is entertaining, it has some great dramatic moments, and if you went into it expecting very little (like I did), you will be quite pleasantly surprised. If you're expecting a great sports movie, then there are many others for you to discover."
4,Have a blindfold and earmuffs handy . . .,This movie is really good as far as plot and acting goes but it's not for the see-no-evil types. My semi-conservative parents were horrified at the nudity and vulgar language-Even my 16 year old brother was embarrassed! Leave this movie for the high-schoolers and college students who are targeted in this film. It's enjoyable but not brain food. It could also promote irresponsible behavior in drug and alcohol use and sexual issues.
4,Pokemon 4Ever The Movie Best Friends Better Heroes,"I feel that Pokemon 4Ever The Movie Best Friends Better Heroes Would be a Cool Movie for The VHS and DVD. mY Favorite Pokemon is Celebi. my other favorite Pokemon Characters are Ash Ketchum, Pikachu, Misty, Togepi, and Brock, and That Evil Pokemon Villian is The Evil Pokemon Emperor and The Pokemon Haunter who tried to catch a Wild Celebi to rule the Forest and The World to detory it so all wil be lots forever and It's up to The Legendary Pokemon Suicune to save the World again to tried to stop The evil Pokemon Emperor from destroying the forest and the WOrld of darkness."
4,A GREAT film but no card...,"This one is very cool and has amazing graphics. Celebi and Suicune appear. This is one of my top favs and has amazing scenes. Worth the money when it comes to the film, but I was disapointed on something.The reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is because I paid an extra 4 dollers to buy a brand new copy so I would get the Suicune card. I got a brand new copy, opened it...no card. I regretted paying an extra 4 dollers, other than that it's a great movie."
4,pokemon the 4th movie,this movie is great.it blows the other 3 movies away. the animation it the greatest of the 4 movie as of yet. i can't wait for this one to come to america on Oct. 11th 2002.
4,Move over Digmon,This is a great movie full of adventure and excitement. Pokemon 4 ever takes place during the period of the time when Ash is in the Juto League. In pokemon forever ash must protect the beautiful pokemon celbi from the evil Iron Masked Marador of team rocket.In this movie you get to she something you never got to she before Professor Oak as a little boy. If you are 7 or older than this movie is fine for you. If you are under 7 this movie may be to intense and violent for you to handle.My favorite part in this movie is when Celebi makes the twig monsters and start destroying the forrest. Attribute to toho who created Godzilla. If you enjoy this you the other pokemon movies. I also recomend Digmon the Movie.This movie also features a short chute little min movie called Pikchu's Pekaboo which should be fine for kids age 7 an up.
4,pokemon 4 ever,"this film was a excellent, i can reccommend that you watch this.there are some sad parts later in the film, which younger children may not like, but on the whole most pokemon fans will enjoy the film.my compliments to the producers of this and every pokemon films and tv series."
5,I loved it!,I watched all 4 pokemon movies (5 was already released in Japan). This movie has big suprises in the end (when the ending song was playing). I loved the story and the pictures. I cannot wait to see the movie #5!!!
2,Stop me if you've heard this before...,"An evil villain uses Pokemon to try to conquer the world. Ash & friends stop him...In my opinion, this is where the Pokemon movies started going downhill. It wasn't bad enough that the brains behind the franchise keep making more Pokemon, most of them ridiculously stupid. Then they tried to force ""light"" and ""dark"" Pokemon on us, which is very superfluous. But they keep making these super powerful legendary Pokemon, and then putting them in these movies in situations where they seem so weak. Why? I don't get it.They should make these movies where the focus Pokemon kicks butt. Like the first few movies. Mewtwo, Lugia, they were beasts. Even Entei represented well. That's what they need to get back to.Maybe I'm being a little overly analytical. After all, it IS a kid's movie. But still, you can make it kid-friendly and still make it entertaining for the adults as well."
1,vapid obscurity,"Alas, in France my son does not go to school on Wednesdays, smack in the middle of the work week. Often, he watches films, right next to me. He has this film, and I see nothing whatsoever interesting about this entire ""system"" of games/films. I just don't get it: while entertaining (and he studies it for clues on how to play the games, often online, so it does develop some thinking skills, I suppose) there is nothing about it that we can talk about. It is junk, so far as I can see. But he absolutely loves it and enters an entire world, with its own rules and vocabulary. I did that, too, and admittedly a lot of it was cr@p.I cannot see anything that parents can share with this, alas. But then, that might be the appeal for him: it's his and we respect that."
5,Surprised me,"The movie is great, Maramax really did a nice job. Good thing Warner Bro gave it up....they riped them apart and added that awful cheesy music. I have seen BOTH Japanese and American versions and yes it is well translated and my biggest surprise was the added parts in the American version. It seemed to make the movie close much better then the original. NICE!"
4,I saw this one on PPV.,"I like it. It was nice. I have seen so far:Pokemon:the first movie,pokemon 2000,pokemon 3,pokemon 4ever,and pokemon destiny deoxys. My favorite is probably pokemon deoxys."
3,drop earnings,They're okay. Would be cuter if the crystal drops were smaller. No complaints otherwise.
4,"Nice try, shame about the Producer","This was MB's (or more likely Warnr Bros.) attempt to ""break into"" the U.S.They had to team up with Gloria Estefan's Brother as producer and the result was a mixed bag of forced attmepts to sound like the Miami Sound Machine (""Don't blame it on that girl"" comes to mind) and their self produced songs. This works very well with their own stuff (""Say it's not too late"", ""good times"" and the amazing ""Wap Bam Boogie"").Unfortunately the Estefan Producions are banal and unflattering but are fortunately limited to 3 tracks. Still a strong buy for the rest..."
3,"Typical Ackroyd; brilliant premise, unremarkable book","Peter Ackroyd has a frustrating habit of taking absolutely wonderful premises, such as this one, and turning them into quite dull books. Occasionally he writes wonderfully, but he appears to have no idea of human emotion, and as normal his characters here are like stilted wooden puppets."
4,he's a dirty mistreater...,"This is funky, primitive, swinging, badass barrelhouse/blues piano at its absolute finest. The two versions of The Dirty Dozens are the Gangster Rap of their day - but what artful argot! (not to say that no Gangster rap is artful...). It's a shame that Sonny Boy Williamson only plays on one track - but it's a great one.This disc is beautifully remastered, as all Documents are. Revelatory!"
5,Still a classic,"i bought this cd back when it first came out and to this day it still gets a regular outing. Along with 'Gretchen' this represents king's x finest moments. There are many outstanding tracks including the achingly beautiful 'Goldilox', all in all an album to send shivers down your spine."
3,Good first effort,"All of the essential elements of what make King's X the best hard rock band nobody's heard can be found on this nice debut: wall-to-wall guitar, provided by Ty Tabor; soulful lead vocals by bassist Doug Pinnick; and complex percussive passages, executed to near perfection by Jerry Gaskill. On top of that are the Beatle-esque harmonies that really set this band apart.The only setback is in the compositional skills of the band itself. While some tracks leap out of the speakers and grab you, like King, Shot Of Love, and Far Far Away, a lot of them are somewhat average and skippable. But for a first album, Out Of the Silent Planet stands tall against most other debuts. The sound is distinct, and this is a signal of better things to come."
5,Kings X Debut Album Hits Well.,"The songs are beautiful, and this bandwas in style in a time when a companyknown as MegaForce worldwide was in asthe company for big major artists.......Ty Tabor, Jerry Gaskill, and Doug Pinickfrom Houston Texas originally from Mississippifrom what i read in glam rock magazine in the1990's, but forever these guys will be Texan.Songs like Shot of Love, Far Far Away, and Goldiloxare beautiful songs, along with the rest.This album is recommended. These guys are the onesespecially in the case of Doug Pinick, and Ty Taborwhom wore High School Band Jackets which looked totallycool in. Kings X Is a band that was never really that popularin its early beginnings, but their popularity grew."
3,What's with all the hype?,"As much as I LOVE King's-X, this album is certainly not worthy of all of the gushing praise lavished upon it.For sure the listener can hear the beginnings of the great music that Gretchen, FHL, and later efforts represent. But I really think that people are reflecting on Silent Planet with a bit too much nostalgia."
4,New Flava Mack- a- Licious,What more can I say It's Gon Cost Ya is bangin.I bought tha CD and I really enjoy this CD from top to bottom.He's got flava for everybody real gangsta.Don't front on this playa he's on tha rise mo fire.
5,For the Music Fan,"All right, so maybe the movie ""Buster"" wasn't a block-buster, and maybe only 7 people have seen it, but you have to give credit to the fact that it had a terrific soundtrack. Anyone who likes Phil Collins won't be disappointed. ""Two Hearts"" was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989, and was a number one hit the same year, along with ""A Groovy Kind of Love,"" which I feel is the most moving song on the album. And thrown in for good measure are Sonny & Cher, the London Symphony Orchestra, Anne Dudley, and the Four Tops for anyone who thinks listening to Collins for an hour is going to do some damage. If you're feeling really daring after listening to the CD, watch the movie, just to try something different."
2,more of the same,not much action nor history but marginally better than their other films...Another day at an reenactment..except your feet don't hurt after..
5,Excellent lotion!,"Body Drench Moisturizing Lotion Original Formula *128 OzThis is the greatest lotion I have ever used! I am very sensitive to fragrances, but this lotion is so mild, I can can use it all the time! I use it from head to toe. It is NEVER sticky or greasy."
5,Great product,I love this lotion. It's great especially out here in the desert. I highly recommend this product whether you tan or not.
5,best body lotion ever!,"purchased the body drench in the one gallon size, I've been using this lotion for several years and was excited to find out that I could get it in that size! this lotion is wonderful for after sun care, or as a daily moisturizer, it's the only lotion that I trust using for my face,as it has a very light scent! great lotion and great price! especially if you use it as much as I do!"
3,More images should be present,"This is the kind of stopper that has the extra piece of plastic jutting out from underneath the top, meant to be plugged in to the hole of your drain. If you have the kind of drain that has a flat mesh circle over it, it will not work. I was looking for the completely flat rubber cover for mine and accidentally got this instead."
4,Perfect Toy for the Pool,I wanted a toy that our four year old could take into the pool that would have a different feature than a propeller. The firehose does work and that was the big hit. I also like that fact that it floats with a fair amount of waves in the pool. It is a very good purchase.I only gave it three stars in durability because of firehose attachment comes very easily off the boat and we have to keep track of it. But the boat itself if very solid.
1,"No, No ... and No!","I am a HUGE Clark Sisters fan -- they put out an album and I buy it, sight unseen. I will probably not listen to much on this album except for maybe one song, which I'll download to my ipod.In light of the high quality of music being put out today, I found the production on this project quite lacking. The sound was not exciting, the music was not exciting or full-sounding like what we're used to hearing today since Kirk Franklin raised the bar some years ago. The project doesn't break any new ground in sound, delivery or lyrics.On the whole, a disappointing outing for me. There was nothing special about this project that made it stand out for me or want me to keep it in the CD player to hear over and over again. It just doesn't stand up to the standard that's out there today -- maybe some years ago, but not now."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"Yes, this video does teach a 'Hula Workout' and appears to have clear instructions. However, the music is atrocious. I was looking forward to some traditional Hawaiian music, the reason that I thought this workout would be fun, but the whole thing is set to a heinous track called ""Hula Rock"" which sounds like a lightly Hawaiian flavored takeoff of a fifties bee-bop style song. I watched this once, and couldn't even get through the thing. The music really ruins this experience."
2,Where's the Hula?,"If you are looking for authentic cultural Hawaiian hula, this is NOT the video for you! It is a good workout, but is lacking in Hawaiian traditions. It is an insult to the sacred dance of the hula. The instructor is 1/2 Western Cowgirl, 1/4 body builder, and 1/4 Kumu Hula. Too much time is spent with the camera-man's nose up her skirt, and some of the ""hula"" moves are a bit vulgar compared to how they are traditionally done. Better to go with Patricia Lei's ""Hula for Health"" video if you are looking for graceful, beautiful hula exercise and dance."
2,THIS IS NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND!,"I, too, expected something quite different. I wanted a fill-in tape to work my hips and thighs in a slow-paced manner. I expected beautiful Hawaiian music, not the goofy Hula Rock. Now I'm on an internet search for another hula tape, but it seems so far that Kili's tapes are the only ones in existence. I go through the instructional parts where the steps are broken down and do this several times, fast-forwarding through the Hula Rock. While I do learn the steps, I definitely didn't get my money's worth."
1,Hula??,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I am out of shape and hoping to go back to what I did as a younger woman to stay fit - dance. What I was expecting was an exercise video using the controlled, graceful moves of the hula dance. You know tone your muscles, learn a beautiful dance and enjoy the gorgeous Hawaiian scenery. What I got with this DVD - a bizarre version of Hawaiian country line dance complete with stomping feet and hokey music which the instructor calls ""Hula Rock"". I made it about five minutes in and then switched to a different exercise DVD. I love exercising to music and have exercise tapes and DVD's from Tanya Tucker's Country Workout to The Goddess Workout (bellydance) and was hoping to add the hula to my collection, but this isn't it.There is no doubt looking at this woman's muscle tone that she gets a good workout, however anyone looking for a relaxing or beautiful dance in this video needs to look elsewhere."
3,Hula Workout for Beginners,"I didn't know what to expect from this DVD, but decided to give it a try.Kili is a wonderful Hawaiian dancer, but there isn't enough repetition of the steps (especially for those of us who learn more slowly and need LOTS of practice). Eight counts, add a movement. Eight more counts, add another movement. I kept having to go back to get the practice I needed/wanted to do the steps correctly.The music isn't at all traditional Hawaiian, but it's sort of fun and was an unexpected surprise.Overall, despite gorgeous scenery and a skillful instructor, this workout is/was disappointing."
2,Where's the Hula?,"If you are looking for authentic cultural Hawaiian hula, this is NOT the video set for you! It is a good workout, but is lacking in Hawaiian traditions. It is an insult to the sacred dance of the hula. The instructor is 1/2 Western Cowgirl, 1/4 body builder, and 1/4 Kumu Hula. Too much time is spent with the camera-man's nose up her skirt, and some of the ""hula"" moves are a bit vulgar compared to how they are traditionally done. Better to go with Patricia Lei's ""Hula for Health"" video if you are looking for graceful, beautiful hula exercise and dance."
3,Warning! Not What You Expect,"If you're expecting to learn traditional hula from a beautiful island woman to traditional Hawaiian drums, you will be as shocked as I was. Instead you will find a Drag performer teaching you the moves to country western music, your goal being to perform ""Hula Rock"".If you can get past the very muscular male physique of Kali (wearing female attire), and you can tolerate the music you will find yourself learning some fairly decent hula moves, getting a very light and very low impact cardio/toning workout. Once you get to the end and perform the dance with the lyrics to the country song, you'll ""get it"" and even have a little fun.Overall I was disappointed, but I'm learning some moves and it's a nice rotation from intense target toning and aerobics. It's also nice to look out into the waters of Hawaii rather than a set for a change. I'm not kicking myself for buying it--after having some time to get used to it."
2,meh..,The technique itself is not bad but you are almost forced to learn a whole dance in one sitting. It would be better if the steps to each dance were a separate menu option.
3,"Yes, it's true...",This video could definitely be better as others have commented. The music is a mistake & the complaints reviewers have noted are valid. I would not recommend purchasing this video. Get a higher rated one from this series. This being 4 years after I bought it I pulled the dusty video out yesterday and played it on mute for the workout. I want to learn Hawaiian dance but can't go for classes right now. I'm out of shape so this 'Hula Workout' is helpful for me to get some strength for when I do take a class. I went ahead and ordered a higher rated video from this series today & look forward to practicing with Hawaiian music. The woman leading this workout is exotically beautiful & as fit as fit can be. I feel inspired just looking at her and the gorgeous Hawaiian scenery in the background.
3,average,"udefeated was somewhat of a dissapointment.if i wasn't such a huge fan of john leguizamo's this movie would have been terrible.it was both predictable and typical.man suffers and dreams.man finds success.man leaves friends behind.man falls in love w/ the used whore.the ending was horrible, no one knows what the hell happened.now for the good part:great boxing scenes,leguizamo's absOnly see this movie if you are a huge john leguizamo fan or boxig fan."
5,Bank on LA Banks,"LA Banks does it again in this volume of her Huntress Legend series. The books keep getting better and better! I read this book in one sitting because I couldn't put it down. I would really like to talk about what happens with the war between Heaven & Hell but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Suffice it to say, Banks' writing is visual and provocative. Unlike most authors who write series, Banks doesn't repeat the same old story in each book, while still maintaining her overall storyline."
4,Another good book!,I loved this book!I think that LA Banks is creative and adds another twist in the vampire myth. She is talented and nows how to put a story together.The only reason why this book gets four stars is the use of Slang thoughout the books which gets distracting.
4,Another great Neteru book,"Again, Ms. Banks has created an outstanding work of fiction. She is able to bring her own unique spin to the vampire mythos to fruition with The Hunted. ""Blinding"" Damali is a stroke of brilliance and gives her yet another obstacle to overcome. I also loved the fact that we are able to learn more about the Guardians' role as Guardians, especially Marlene, the mother figure of the book.Once again, however, the dialogue is the major sticking point for me. While it's dynamic and true to life, I find it a bit tedious after a while and hard to follow when more than one character is ""speaking"". To me, there is very little in the way of personalization and uniqueness to the characters with regards to the dialogue.But, overall, I admire Ms. Banks' contributions to vampire fiction and look forward to many more great books in the Vampire Huntress series."
5,Simply the best,"I have to say, this book has been the best by far in the Huntress series.It held my attention from beginng to end.The characters were interesting as were the setting and plot. Job well done Ms. Banks!"
4,wow!,"tHE SEX SCENE MADE YOU WANNA GO FIND cARLOS .vERY GOOD BOOK , BUT i DONT THINK i'LL FINISH THE SERIES IT'S JUST NOT THAT GREAT AND i FIND THEM HARD TO READ WHEN THEY DO ALL THE DIALOGUE .i FOUND IT REDICULOUS THAT SHE DIDNT JUST STAKE cARLOS AFTER THE INCIIDENT WITH THE WERE-DEMON.i WOULD HAVE"
1,Did not like this book much,I did not even finish it. I did not like the way it was written (the expressions they used). Did not hold my interest.
1,I'm done with this series!,"I tore through the first book, tore through the second book, muddled through the third book and gave up. Ms. Banks takes fantasy to another level, I call it unbelievable. The Double Plunge, Damali is a vampire, no she's not, well she is but she's not and Carlos is, but he can be changed back. There were so many plot twists in this story that I decided I just didn't care anymore! I had all her books, but i couldn't force myself to read anymore. Thumbs down on this one and the series."
3,"Impressive, technically","I think a lot of people are exaggerating the greatness of this cd. Twilight is My Robe and The Apostle in Triumph are the only songs that are consistently good. In Forest of October, I really only like the guitar solo and maybe one other climactic moment. I feel like some fat could be trimmed off the song. The acoustic breaks in the first track are also a bit awkward. They cut off the energy of the piece, so that I don't care very much about what happens next. If you concentrate on the music note-by-note, Opeth seems really clever, but if I wanted a cerebral musical experience, I'd listen to Magnus Lindberg."
4,"Amazing CD, not-so-amazing bonus track","If you're reading this review, chances are you already know that Orchid is an amazing album. You probably even own a copy already, and just want to know if it is worth the extra money to have the one bonus track that is on this reissue. The answer, sadly, is no. The bonus track, Into the Frost of Winter, is a basically a poor quality demo recording of a song that was later incorporated into the Morningrise album. It really doesn't add anything to the album. In fact, it almost takes away from the brilliant work that is Orchid. If I were to review the regular edition of the album I would give it 5 stars easily. Because of the poor quality of the bonus track, and the high price of the reissue, I am rating this edition at 4 stars. I would recommend it only to those people (like me) who are completists and have to own every single Opeth song."
5,I love this album!,"This is a really good melodic piece of work, opeth has a lot of catchy riffs, bass lines, and beats in this one. Too many people ignore Orchid and Morningrise but they are great albums produced and probably influenced by Dan Swano. On a side note it was good to see Mikael and Dan team up on the first two Bloodbath albums, check them out if you are looking for some metal to add to your collection."
5,great purchase,"this purchase was fast and hassle free, was a great experience look forward to doing buisness with this seller in the future."
1,Long and Boring,"I had to read this book for a history class in college, and I must say it was a poor choice for the class. The author throws out many obscure names, and expects you to know who they. He goes on and on about the authors of the period and their respective eccentricities. The reader is treated to countless pages about who so-and-so was friends with, and what tea party they attended that evening. It simply fails to help the reader appreciate this remarkable period in America's history."
5,The Roaring Twenties- a culturally vital era,"Harlem's gaudiest and best-known nightspot was a ""whites only"" nightclub serving Vaudevillian-style black entertainment to the white patrons that flooded into Harlem from downtown Manhattan. Everybody was swinging and boozing. They were high times and they were really hopping. Alcohol sales and consumption climbed rapidly. Nightclubs, cabarets and after-hours clubs, on the strip of 133rd Street between Lenox and Seventh Avenues, thrived with the influx of white trade. Jazz, big bands, blues, and high-steppin', ""high-yeller"" girls set the tone. Money flowed in like water and the Mob's power grew. In the midst of all that was occurring, black artists, intellectuals and social activists flourished throughout Harlem in what is now called The Harlem Renaissance. Very well researched vital to learning about the richness of American life and character"
4,When Harlem was in Vogue,I have not had the opportunity to read this selection. I am interested in the Harlem Renaissance and will read this at first chance.
2,history book for the historians,"This book can be described as a history book for the historians for the simple fact that it has too much information for the regular reader. The book reads more like a text book then anything. The author will mention name after name, but without giving proper introduction of who the people are, leaving the reader lost unless they know their history to a great length. The book also has some shortcomings on how much of it is about harlem, rather it is about the leaders of the Harlem Renaissance. As the preface mentions the book could have been subtitled (or titled) Civil Rights by copywrite. This would have been a more fitting title for the author focuses more on the great literature at the time and its authors then anything else. While the book has a ton of facts, and an indepth look into many works, I failed to gain much insight into the events that the book is writing about."
3,Makes hardware installation easy,"It is a good product that makes cabinet hardware installation easy, quick, and accurate. However, its a bit on the expensive side. Home Depot or Lowes has the same for a little cheaper. Also, make sure this will fit the size of pulls that you are installing. I believe the biggest spread on this one is 3-1/2""."
3,Great but not for metric...,This is an excellent product unless you want to install Metric...The metric only have one placement option and that placement will not work for most drawers...If you are buying the 96mm spread handles do not buy this product because you will spend way more time trying to make this work....
1,Lack of details made a dud purchase for me,"Bought the drawer front and cabinet front templates to help with installing all the new handles in our new kitchen. When we stripped the packaging--only then did we realize they wouldn't work with our handles. Our hardware had 5"" centers and the templates only work up to 4"". I didn't spot this information anywhere or I would not have ordered them. The style is long handles right now, but be aware that this product doesn't allow for them."
3,Decent Item,Jig works as it's designed. Could be a little better quality but you get what you pay for. Perfect for the price.
2,Why are the holes so small?,"I used this template for my upper cabinets, but it wasn't as easy as it could have been. The holes in the template are so small that neither a drill bit, nor a pencil tip would fit through it to make contact with the door. I had to use an awl (and does everyone have one of these?)and push hard so that I could see the mark, then I had to mark with a pencil or drill."
1,Does not fit GMC side post batteries.,This did not fit the side post battery that I had. The threads were not long enough in the battery to even get but two or three threads turned into the battery. The battery cable was just slopping around loose on the post after the thing bottomed out. Took it off and cleaned up and reused the old post.
1,Stripped on installation,"These battery bolts arrived quickly from Amazon and were packed well. However, upon attempting to install them, both of them stripped. They'd go in about 1/4 inch, which is less than the OEM bolts would go in, and then strip out. The battery is a brand new Johnson Controls (Energizer) from Sam's Club that works fine with the OEM bolts.I'll try the short versions, as I'm sold on the idea of gold-plated electrical connectors."
5,It is awesome,"This movie has got to be the most action packed movie. Fighters, cons, FBI, deadly chemicals and top secret weapons make this movie a must see! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
4,this is a pretty good movie,"This movie is all action with a little bit of suggestive material. It has alot of action and some pretty gorey scenes. This is only for people who have a like for violence, it is not a classic. Sean Connery does a good job but the plot of the movie isn't that good."
2,It's like there is a big void!,"To be honest, looking back at this 90s action/thriller, i come to think that Hollywood was easily ammused with fireworks, bombs and guns in a storyline. Add some big names into the mix and an acclaimed director and guess what, the movie fails. The Rock, plainly based on the world's fate or San Francsico for that matter, it just about a bunch of guys trying to evade the green rocks from exploding and causing mass chaos and nucleur reactivity.I admire Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery because their acting can sometimes be of higher class (Adaptation, From Russia with Love), but acting in a thriller with the worst storyline of the 90s changed my mind of watching big names in summer action blockbusters. If you like the 'bangs' and have no moral taste in movies, than surely this is for you. I give it two stars for the mild action sequences provided, not even by the actors but by the stuntmen, without whom this film would be impossible."
2,This movie totally didn't need a Criterion version,"Note: 2.5 stars, but the .5 is for the Criterion edition itself, the extras and the mastering.The Criterion Collection has always put out great movies from great filmmakers; Jean Renoir's The Grand Illusion, Fritz Lang's M, Jules Dassin's Theives' Highway, and now... The Rock? And on top of that, Michael Bay's The Rock? Michael Bay for years has epitomized big-budget, badly acted schlock whose only attraction is being loud and full of explosions. Formula movies at best. It was fine for what it was, and Sean Connery is always cool, but it totally wasn't Criterion."
2,vanessa marcil,I just watched this film for Vanessa Marcil who plays Nicholas Cages girlfriend in this film. I honestly did not like the film and Vanessa barely had any lines. I payed no attention to the plot. All the action did not interest me.
5,Another Great Criterion Disc,"OK, you all know the movie, it's a better than average action movie, with a great cast. But this disc is out of this world, image is stunning, sound is deafening, and the commentary is worth the price of admission alone as Cage and Harris in particular are fascinating. Once again Criterion come up trumps, this 2 disc set now sits proudly next to Unbearable lightness of Being and Insomnia for perhaps the first time in it's existence!"
4,Excellent Film,I have been waiting for this film to come out on dvd for a long time now and at last its out. The Rock is a film that is full of special effects and features some of the best actors around ta the moment. The Rock stars Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage who have to team up on Alcatraz to help stop someone unleashing a missile on the centre of America. Sean Connery was formaly a prisoner in Alcatraz and the only one ever to escape which is why he teams up with Nicholas cage as he knows the prison inside out. The Rock will captivate you from the beginning and wont let you go until the end where you will be begging for more.
4,Good thriller with great actors,"Beautifully cast with Nicholas Cage as the reluctant biochemist and Sean Connery as the only man ever to have escaped from Alcatraz teaming up to defeat Ed Harris, playing a psychotic who is holding San Francisco virtual hostage. Before long, all the players are in place and viewers are treated to an action-packed couple of hours of bullets, bodies, explosions, close calls, harebrained 2nd guessing, near misses, near hits - and I don't care how many of these over-the-top movied you've seen: this one keeps you on the edge of your seat.Sean Connery, of course, plays himself - and that slight Scottish lisp and raised eyebrow are both firmly in place; he's simply terrific. So is Cage, whom I don't usually enjoy watching - he's just too pathetic and conflicted looking. But he's perfectly case in The Rock. It's obvious that the actors had a ball during the filming. Viewers will too. Don't miss it."
5,TRULY AMAZING,Although this point would definetly be argued this is not only my favorite film but one of the greatest EVER! Cage and Connery do a magnificent job and Harris portrays his chrachter amazingly. There is tons of action and even a little drama for those teary eyed folks(think marine scene)!!! This film is truly amazing and needs to be seen by everyone!
4,A Thriller That Rocks,"There are a variety of many-splendored reasons to watch this 1996 action flick, where an early peek at pre-9/11 terrorism rears its ugly head. The performances soar: Sean Connery as a nonchalant killer intent on saving ""The City By the Bay"" - Nicholas Cage, as his astute but nervous student - and Ed Harris as a fearless mad Marine who formulated a plot to blow up San Francisco through the tunnels of Alcatraz. I enjoyed the love angle between Nicholas Cage and his girlfriend and the redemption of Sean Connery for the one reason on earth he has to live: to make amends with his lovely daughter. See the movie! And have in hand, as I did, your remote control to lower the crash-bang volume. This movie was sooo exciting I lay in fetal position at the end!"
4,best bond film ever,"The most clever thing about this witty film is the fact that Sean Connery is basically playing James Bond - albeit a James Bond who just spent 30 years in the nastiest federal prisons the US of A has to offer. If the ludicrous plot, gratuitous destruction and cliched characters aren't a hindrance to you, then you are in for the a treat. This movie is not only ridiculously action packed, it verges on self-mocking, and has some of the best one-liners ever. With this dvd edition, The Rock gets the treatment that it deserves. Buy it and rejoice."
5,The Rock- ROCKS!,"Great movie, lots of action. It's fun, witty and pretty exciting. Highly recommend this movie to any action movie fan! One of the all time classics."
3,Cage Anyone?,I enjoyed The Rock as a film...and where else can you buy DVD's used like-new for cheap!
5,The Rock Rocks,"I remember that this movie came out in theaters while I was in high school around the same time as Independence Day. I saw the Rock first and liked it better. I know... many people would find that statement unpatriotic, but this movie has a good plot, good action, and just keeps you on the edge of you seat. This all comes from someone who generally prefers the romantic comedies, but somehow this movie captivated me and still remains one of my all time favorite movies. What can I say? This girl thinks that the Rock, well...rocks!"
4,One Helluva Ride!!!!!,"Sure, the plot is so full of holes that you could run a freight train through 'em, but who cares? Once this roller coaster gets going, it doesn't stop for anything. Excellent performances from absolutely everyone, especially Cage, Harris, and of course, Connery. Highly entertaining, even if this is the 500th time we've seen psychotic Marines destroying everything in sight."
4,Realistic and Amazing,This film as I said is a very realistic one. This is because the commando sent to alcatraz seems to be heroic but in the middle of the film nearly all of them die. Only few of them survive [the main actors]. So it is not the same story that the AMERICAN heros win in an way without being hit from a bullet. On the other hand their are some exagerations .. when the F-16 destroy Alcatraz...the flying trum. But on the whole it is a good film with amazing screen shoots espacialy if you like war planes and a lot of explosions...give special attention to the trum in the begining of the film.Nice Film REALY AMAZING !!!

5,Action/comedy classic,"Feel like just sitting on the couch and killing a few hours with a video? The Rock is a great movie to just sit back and watch over and over. While the plot is thin, isn't it always with an action film? It is Unconventional Warfare (chemical weapons and the SEAL/Marine Recon team) that is believable, unlike, say, the Under Siege series. I've lost count of the amount of times I've seen this movie and always remember classic quotes like ""Glass or plastic?"" and ""Ah'll take pleasure in guttin' yew, boa. Lot of teenage I'm-angry-at-my-father-anger here..."" Great performances by Connery in the role of an untried SAS spy (slightly unbelievable), Nick Cage (FBI Agent Stan Goodspeed, Chemical Weapons expert) and Ed Harris (revolting Marine Commander.)"
5,A Movie That Realy Rocks!,"I'm really amazed of this Criterion Collection quality. Fortunately, it comes with the DTS soundtrack. Those of you with DTS receiver or compatible player should find all your 6 speakers performing lots of 'work-out'.Picture & audio quality are excellent. This is a highly action movie that will definitely glue you to your seat from the start right until the end credit. My record of watching this movie is 5 times excluding from laserdisc & tv broadcast. You'll never regret this DVD collection!"
5,The Rock . . . ROCKS!,"This is my favorite movie! Nicolas Cage is great (also my favorite actor)! Sean Connery and Ed Harris are great! Everyone is great! Full of action and plenty of humor, which makes a great combonation. If you haven't seen this you should. I own 2 copies of it! Just . . . GREAT!"
5,JUST AMAZING,FOR NICHOLAS CAGES FIRST REAL ACTUON MOVIE HE DID A GREAT JOB OF IT WHICH LED HIM TO MORE ACTION MOVIES SUCH AS FACE/OFF AND CON AIR. HE AND SEAN CONNERY WORKED WELL TOGATHER. RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE SEES THIS MOVIE. AN EASY 5 STAR RATING.
3,"Lotsa action, but that's about it.","Soldiers dropping like flys, an improbable ending, and restrained acting are the unfortunate highlights of this film. To me at least, the storyline was too weak, or at least the location. Just didn't work for me."
3,A Good B Rated Action Movie,"This is a good movie to watch on the superstation or when you have nothing better to do. It isn't a complete letdown, but was definately not as good as Die Hard, or Entrapment. The movie had some really cool action scenes. Ed Harris, Nicholas Cage, and Sean Connery all were really good. There also was a lot of violent battle scenes that were interesting, and the finale at the end is really cool. The movie is good, but if you have high standards for action, pick something else instead."
3,Husband loves this movie..not my genre,Lots of action but predictable. Husband loves this movie and I bought it for him. Not my favorite movie genre.
2,A Huge Disappointment,"The Rock is your typical Hollywood action extravaganza. Big, loud, annoying and stupid. Only Nic Cage gives this film any sense of worth watching."
1,More mindless Hollywood dreck,"Other than a lack of dialogue,character development,a decent script,a realistic storyline or any point in having been made at all, this is a good movie."
4,action hero stuff,"this film is the best the first time youve seen it,then after a few times it gets so boreing you cant watch 5sec's of it so my advice is rent it don't buy it."
5,One of the best bluray movies!,This move is entertaining all the way plus its in blu ray! beautiful. 5 stars.
4,"Good movie, but unbelievable action scenes","The reason this movie fails to get a five star rating from me is because of its extreme action scenes. Some examples of these are: when the trolley explodes, when Mason (Connery) crushes half of a parked car, when the F/A-18s pulled away at the very last second (it would be impossible in real life), and when Stanley (Cage) isn't hurt from the final explosion at the end. The movie would be five starts if the scenes above were more refined or devloped. However it did have great sound and great performance from Ed Harris. The bottom line: if you like well-developed, realistic movies, don't see The Rock. However, if you are in to non-stop, explosive, in-your-face action, then by all means see this movie."
4,Classic!,"My wonderful bride surprised me with a trip to San Fransico for my birthday. While we were about to depart for Alcatraz Island, I found out she had never seen the movie ""The Rock"" and ordered it from my phone so we could watch it when we got back home.Watching this movie again, I remember why I love it. Quotes like ""I'd take pleasure in guttin' you, boy."" will now make sense to my kids! All those times that I told my co-worker she should try the shrimp so I can stab her in the heart with her epi pen!This movie is exciting and entertaining. It should be required to be watched before graduating high school."
2,Warning - missing content,This review has nothing to do with the quality of the movie and everything to do with the quality of the DVD.The 'widescreen' is really a fullscreen movie with matting (horizontal black bars) added at the top and bottom. What does this mean? MISSING CONTENT. You just cannot enjoy the movie with this presentation.
5,another nick cage hit,"I love Nick Cage in his bigger films like this, con air & gone in 60 seconds, and face off. I think he is one of my favorite actors."
1,The guy who made it was smokin rocks obviously.,The absence of a plot turns potential into crap. Its no fun watching a freaking old guy run around a rat filled alcatraz shooting blanks at people. Nicolis cage cant even act like he has a clue. and it gets a little annoying when they use their limited vocabulary through the WHOLE movie. did i mention the OLD GUY?? This movie was a waste of money.
3,"Okay, but not Great","Okay, so I bought a PS3 console yesterday, and decided to get a Blu-Ray movie just to see how awesome it was.Comparing the BD vs. the DVD in an up-sampling DVD player, there was no discernable difference.The movie itself is fun -- like another poster said, the plot is something of a stretch, but it's got the awesome Simpson/Bruckheimer explosions, firefights, and camera angles/cinematography."
1,"Good, if you like mindless action.","While the performances of the actors are satisfactory, they can not compensate for the formulaic, unoriginal, predictable, and sucker-by-previews style of worthless movies directed by the Michael Bay, and produced Jerry Bruckheimer. Yeah, I said it! Many of you thought so in one form or another when you saw Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys, or Armageddon. Their movies wreak of contrived melodrama (the massacre of the squad inside the prison), weak plot (get in, get out), weak dialogue (with a few mild attempts at humour). How can a movie be exciting if it is utterly predictable, and so insipid and ludicrous that it is unbelievable? If you want a real action movie, watch Die Hard! It has everything, this movie could never achieve."
1,The Rock,"This movie is horrible. Exactly what is Ed Harris mad about. Nick Cage does his usual over acting,I can't believe this guy won an Oscar."
1,"Racist, Sexist, Anti-Gay","What a horrible excuse for film. The African American characters are portrayed as knife-wielding, blood-thirsty, foul-mouthed animals. The only female characters are: a) A completely worthless ditz, and; b) An extremely foul-mouthed African-American woman threatening gun violence. And the cherry on this Michael Bey/Jerry Bruckheimer sundae: A obviously gay hair dresser.. in San Francisco. Get it? He's GAY.. a HAIRDRESSER.. and it's SAN FRANCISCO!!!! Get it? Get it? Hee yuk! Haw haw haw!Don't get me wrong, I love a good, violent action flick. REAL man-movies. Peckinpah, Verhoeven, Kurosawa, Tarantino. THIS one is an execrable waste of celluoid. If I could have given it negative 5-stars, I would have.Oh yeah.. I hope this doesn't violate Amazon's ""No Spoilers"" rule, but Nicholas Cage's character.. he's an Elvis fan! Does Cage play an Elvis fan in EVERY FREAKING MOVIE he makes?Ugh."
5,A great film to see time after time!,"I really, really, really like this film. I love everything about it. It a great film, and a 'must' buy. I can see it time after time and still not get bored. The direction is especially good, with great editing. Sean Connery is fantastic as John Mason (he's really just an old James Bond- but the suits him so well). Nic Cage is great as well. The DVD quality is great, but I hope they bring out a special edition! I would certainly buy it!"
4,"The Rock, rocks!!","I love this movie! It came as a suprise to me because I'm not normally a big fan of the action genre. The story itself has levels deeper than the special effects and explosions. You care about the characters and what has and will happen in their lives. Okay, completely believeable, not so much, but that's the fun of the action genre!"
1,Awful DVD - will be seeking refund,"This review is about the regular edition DVD, not the Criterion one.The DVD is a piece of garbage. IT CLAIMS TO BE WIDESCREEN, BUT IT IS NOT. IT IS ENCODED AT A FULLSCREEN DVD RATIO WITH LETTERBOXES. Not only does this waste space, but it gives the picture actually a smaller resolution than it should have as a DVD. I wouldn't be surprised if they took a pan&scan; print and chopped off the top and bottom, like the Back to the Future box set fiasco. I will be comparing to my friend's copy he taped off TV to see if it is so."
4,Great action movie.,"This movie has one of those plots where there is a overwhelming bad guy and there's only one man that can stop him(Connery)it's a great film.Cage has a good role, and very funny."
4,Entertaining!,"I don't like many Bay movies because he has very little skill in crafting a honest and detailed movie. Armageddon was a horrendous piece of donkey dung, everything that's wrong with Hollywood was detailed in that schlock! The Rock is a slightly different proposition, it's entertaining and never tries to be anything but! The story is thin and the dialogue is typically bad at times. The action is excellent and Sean Connery makes the movie work! The direction is very Mtv, the editing is silly at times - what's with the quick cuts? Why can't I enjoy the compositions? Pathetic! But still, the pace is consistent. The acting is okay, Connery's presence elevates the material. Ed Harris is always dependable and Cage is pretty funny as Goodspeed. The music is very patriotic and but fun. Overall, entertaining, switch your brain off! After this, Bay descended into familiar MTV garbage!"
5,The Rock & Sean,"A bit too much, ""Oh my gosh, how could they do that""?, but then we can't forget the overactive minds in Hollywood and their need to fill so many minutes with good or stupid scenes and as usual, they pick the stupid. The movie is about 90% good and 10% stupid."
5,Great transfer to Blu-Ray!,"More than likely, you already know whether you like this movie or not. Thequestion you may be asking is ""If I own the DVD, is it worth upgrading tothe BD version?"" I'm happy to report that this is a great transfer, and isa major upgrade from the DVD version, assuming that you have a audio/videosystem that can allow you to see and hear the difference. The picture isfar more detailed than the DVD version, and the uncompressed PCM audiotrack is fantastic. Kudos to Disney for doing an excellent job on this one.Highly recommended."
3,SO-SO,"Great cast, but that's about it. Things get blowed up real good, but c'mon, how about a little suspense? Could be the most boring car chase in the history of movies also."
3,Buy it on VHS,"Don't get me wrong, this classic action thriller is certainly a five star movie - but only if you buy it on VHS. As you can tell, I have a few bones with the DVD version of this film. The sound is incredible on DVD; everything in my house was shaking before I even took the volume knob near half-power. However, the picture itself only occupies the middle two-quarters of the screen, and the widescreen mode only left a disappointing little box in the center of any TV I tried it on (which included 34, 20, 55, and 60 inch televisions, all of which were widescreen compatible). Unless you're looking to bring your house down, buy this awesome movie on VHS so at least the picture takes up the WHOLE screen and you get a full movie going experience."
5,"The Rock is an ""hanging for dear life"" action thriller","The Rock is a wonderful film, representing the greatest action movie I have seen in a while. The stars, Connery and Cage, act perfectly throughout the movie while shutting down the ransom and knocking out Harris! A MUST-SEE!!!! END"
4,I forgot how good this movie is!,This movie still is just great. The picture quality on the Blu-Ray is also just outstanding.
1,Distorted audio mars excellent music,"The download version has some major problems with some of the audio files. It's not the normal pops, clicks, and hiss you'll hear from material dubbed from 78s. Several of the tunes have a sort of phasing effect similar to what happens when somemone has applied electronic noise reduction too heavily. It's too bad. This is some great music. Martin is a gem. Because of the audio problems I would have rated this no stars if the option were available."
5,best of artist,this is a cd you must have if you love stacey q.this cd was passed over in the 80s but it should have been the hit it wasnt.alot better than hard machine.
3,Interesting,Didn't think id like another vampire book after twilight but the more I read this one the more interested I became.looking forward to reading the next book to see where it goes._
5,"Sailor Moon R, S, and Super S","This has to be one of my favorite parts of being a Sailor Moon fan ever! To have all three of the Sailor Moon movies at home, and what's even better, they're all dubbed in English. Although the movies and the shows are better in Japanese, I perfer English for my little sister's sake. She loves Sailor Moon but can't read the subtitles very fast (that's because she is distracted by the movie). So my mom has to read it to her. But don't get me wrong! I love these movies. Sailor Moon R - The Promise of the Rose is my favorite. But the rest of you Sailor Moon fans can decide for yourself which one you like best. It's a great sereis to have, especially if you are a huge SM fan like me (that's why I picked my name)!"
5,great for poetry phobes,I am studying American poetry and have always felt shaky about analyzing poets and their works. I like this book because it's more in depth than Cliff Notes and more sophisticated. It also pointed me toward more stuff than the net did. The biography of Frost was really helpful.
2,Not so happy,Even though this product met my needs it came in bad shape. The damage was to the top of the table in 2 places and I did not have to time to send it back and have it replaced or get my money back. It was a lot of money to waste on poor packaging from the vendor.
4,"Good quality, easy to assemble table.","Son broke his leg and this table has come in handy. Price is reasonablecompared to a med supply bricks and sticks store. It's utility can becapitalized upon for uses beyond sick-bed (i.e., t.v. tray, ""breakfast-in-bed"", etc.)."
1,the tabletop drops way too easily,"The height-adjustment lever on the side of the tabletop does nothing, and a little downward pressure near the end of the tabletop where the lever is causes the tabletop to quickly drop down as low as it goes.Note that the height-adjustment lever was already assembled with the tabletop, so there was nothing for me to do. The lever feels completely loose, in that there is no engagement into anything that I can tell, that would cause it to lock the current height in place.In effect, this overbed table is unsafe and useless at any height other than its lowest tabletop height of about 36 inches.In summary, it's a 36-inch high tabletop. Not completely useless, but nearly useless for my dad."
3,Tabletop is good and tilt is good but no way to keep things from sliding off when in tilt mode,"The tabletop is a good side and it's nice having the tilt and pretty easy to raise up and down but I never could make use of the tilt because there was nothing to keep anything from sliding off when in tilt mode. Also, I found the casters do not to roll well at all. They have to be in the exact straight position to roll. If they are turned at all, it locks up and causes the table not to roll. My husband said he thinks it had some adjustment to a nut that could possibly have helped but it's in such an awkward place to try to get to do it, he never did attempt it because he didn't have a tool to handle it. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't buy this table. I had hip replacement surgery and was moving the table from the living room to the bedroom every day and the non-functioning wheels were a big frustration."
1,No Zero Star Rating?,"This album is just putrid. How anyone could not break this immediately after listening to it is a sign of clear dementia. These guys not only cannot sing or play music, they are also a bunch of jesus worshipping fags. Just listen to ""Ascendancy"". This is clearly one of the worst bands I have ever heard. They are trying to be Killswitch mixed with old school crappy power metal. A true failure and any fan of Trivium should be immediately led into their local gas chamber."
1,"Future of Metal, What a joke","These guys are terrible, theyre decent musicians but that doesnt make them a good bandthey are pretty much a second rate metallica clone with some of the worst vocals evermetallcore is becoming the new, nu-metal"
2,uninspired,by now ive basically grown tired of the metalcore genre. seems like every band seems to be going for the same idea and sound if by accident or not. Trivium seem to be oblivious to this. At this point whose cdrown of the genre. Trvium it aint.despite some admirable solos scattered tthroughout the album is dragged down by nu-metal staleness and over familiar stylings. The vocals are pretty weak and when the vocals cleaning they sound forced and irritating. the screaming is old news if tollerable. but despite the bands best efforts to keep it from being boring the band doesnt have much to offer. Trivium is sadly another nail in the brief light seen from the coffin.
3,"Pretty good release, but didn't live up to the hype.","From all the buzz about these guys, I was expecting something totally revolutionary that made you think ""Man, I guess I didn't know what metal was until now."" It is not great. But it is above average. I think that they are a pretty young band that has plenty of time to come into their own. Lots of potential here. But bands like Killswitch Engage, who employ a style similar to Trivium, are head and shoulders above them yet. Still, I enjoyed half the songs on this disc, and if you're looking for something new, you could do much worse. I give this 3.5 stars."
2,"Matt Heafy, get the fudge out.","To start with, the instruments on this album are great. In fact, if this was a strictly instrumental album, I think it might get four stars from me. But there's this guy called Matt Heafy in the band. And his ""metal vocals"" annoy the hell out of me. The guy can sing just fine (listen to ""Dying in Your Arms"" or the Roadrunner United tune ""The End""), but everytime he starts to do that metal bellow it just makes me want to listen to far better metal men like Dez Fafara (DevilDriver) or Randy Blythe (Lamb Of God). Maybe they should get a new singer, maybe they should pursue another road. Regardless, ""Ascendancy"", as is, is a broken album."
2,Typical Metal-Core,"If you enjoy listening to ordinary and derivative music with cliched vocals that alternate between growling and melodic, you will love Trivium.If you still get a kick out of your old Slayer, Megadeth, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Morbid Angel, Motorhead, Metallica, Death and Carcass albums, you'll probably find Trivium boring."
4,Trivium rocks,"Its like new-age Metallica that DOESN'T suck. Its all good. The guitars are probably the biggest reason why I think this is a good buy. the powerful, high tempo drums also make this very good."
4,Awesome,"Trivium is an awesome band, and this cd is just what the metal world needed. Its a high quality album. my favoate song is ''Pull Harder On The Strings Of Your Matrtyr'' This cd rocks baby"
5,Wow! (just WOW),"Okay, Trivium is an amazing band! For how young they are they play like they've been together for 10 years! They've been called ""the next Metallica."" This is the second album from this band, the first being Ember to Inferno. I first saw them at Ozzfest and Look forward to seeing them at Sounds of the Underground.+(like I said) They sound great!+These songs are well written and the transition between songs is great!+ They have a great sense of humor. (they played the opening riff to Ride the Lighting at the end of The Deceived last time I saw them)-These songs are well written, but I don't feel there as deep as the songs from the previous album."
2,2 Stars for Musical Effort,"I was looking forward to this album when I heard ""Gunshot to the..."" and I liked the style of music that Trivium was playing. It is easy to hear that they are highly influenced by 80's Thrash and Metal, while throwing in some modern twist of thier own. Problem is that the vocals kill this album. I really can't stand the screaming, then going to singing, then back again. This works with a few bands, such as Linkin Park, since it seems to flow with thier music, but its like the vocal and music just don't mix, and its gets in your nerves. Happy to say that this vocal style hit the scrap heap for the new album. New album has almost a Chuck Billy/James Hetfield vocal approach to it, and it really flows. If you want to take a chance with this, you might like it, but if you are new to the band, I think that you will love the new album much more then this effort."
2,Awful,"How can they get away with blatantly ripping off so many other bands? In the first few minutes of ""Pull Harder..."" they had ripped off ""Hangar 18""(Megadeth), and that riff in the middle of ""Imperium"" (Machine Head). Everything about this is unoriginal and poorly executed. From their overuse of those stupid octave chords to their awful vocals, not even mentioning their pointless solos that are some of the worst I've ever heard. If your going to use legato as extensively as they do it has to fit into the song, it has to have a reason for being there, not just to show off that you can move your fingers quite fast without any pattern of thought. It's pathetic that so many people are calling this the future of metal when its just a (copyright infringing) poor rehash of everything that has come before them. The new Metallica? You've got to be kidding me."
2,...crap...,"I gave this two stars because it seems evident that the guitarists have some skill and some of the leads sound fairly interesting. This band however are not the ""next Metallica"" or the ""saviors of metal"" or whatever label they are getting this week to help sell their albums. Around the time this was released a friend that I had at the time burnt me a copy of this knowing my love for metal proclaiming he had found a great band. I was so disappointed that this passed for something amazing in his eyes...but he isn't alone, there are tons of kids that play this right before they throw on their emo albums. Don't be fooled by a marketing campaign that tries to brand these guys as the next great anything."
2,you gotta be kidding me,"This band sucks. Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr is the only song in the realm of acceptibility. This band is by no means the next Metallica. How anyone can even draw comparisons between the two just blows my mind. The only reason I even gave the album 2 stars is because the guy can actually sing. If you have any taste in metal, you won't waste your money on this album."
5,Best band around,"I have always loved Trivum, and this cd was no exception. I never used to be into metal before hearing of trivium. Matt Heafy has wonderful vocals, as well as song writing. All the songs on this cd were great. Even the begining song, had a nice flow. ""Dying In Your Arms"" though, was my all time favorite. With a cd like this, I can see why Matt Heafy was asked to become one of the four team captains in roadrunner united."
1,death metal??,why do people keep saying this is melodic death metal. its crappy metalcore for newbs.
4,"Cowers in comparison to titans Metallica and Megadeth, but they do rock.","I finally sat through a round of ""Ascendancy"" after hearing many good things, and I must say that I am impressed. However, there is no way Trivium could never live up to the glorious name of Megadeth. Metallica, maybe. But Megadeth? Pantera? I don't think so."
3,A Good Music,"To be honest, this album is a good boy and is good. Matt Heafy is a good boy with nice skin like a little flower person. Corey's skin is nice and soft too but he has herpes and I wouldn't have sex with him without protection. They all have nice buns and can count really high like to 50 or 100.Thank you."
1,Trivial,"David Hassenfluffer can sing far better than the lead singer of this band. Screaming through a distorted microphone takes zero talent.Sadly the particularly good track, 'Hot Shot City', is not on this album, but even if it were my rating would not change."
1,the worst music ever made,"I thought hearing a short bit of piano music to start the album would be a sure sign of a creative, exciting listen. Boy was I wrong. This is just straight up horrendous, brain-shaking atrocious useless noise. There's nothing appealing about a singer switching from incredibly annoying and noisy vocals to unmemorable second rate alternative rock. This is the worst thing I have ever listened to."
5,Impossible to listen to anything else,"I've been listening to this CD constantly since I found it, and all I can say is...effin amazing. Between the incredibly talented and catchy guitar work, beautiful solos, the singer's amazing voice (both clean and screaming) and powerful lyrics, and the drums which fit perfectly with every song, this is an album I could listen to for days on end. My favorite tracks are ""Like Light to the Flies"" with a chorus that'll be stuck in your head forever, ""Pull Harder on the Strings of your Martyr"" which is just plain amazing all the way through, and ""Suffocating Sight"", the distance effect on the chorus at the end into the key change is just brilliant. Be sure to add this to your collection if you love pure modern metal."
4,More then just hardcore,"i saw this cd in my revolver mag. and picked it up, im not disappointed at all, good hardcore cd, with plenty of growling and good breakdowns. this cd wont blow your socks off if your into this music thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5, and its not something new but i like whats this band has done. its been in my cd player for almost a month and i will definately pick up there other cd."
4,A supurb onslaught of metal but....,"This album is very good, Similar to Lamb of God and Shadows Fall it stands above the rest of the class as far as instrumention and in some cases vocals, if you want a more in depth review, read one of the other ones that take it apart song by song...... A supurb onslaught of metal but.... it's not Metallica, I don't care how many people disagree with me and click no on my review do not buy this album under the false pretense that this is by any means equal to or even god forbid better that Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning. People who are writing those reviews have got to be groupies of the band or family members of the band because that is wayyyyy off from the truth. Metallica revolutionized metal, this band took a style that has been done a million times already in the last 10 years and put a spin on it, I'm not saying I don't like these guys but call a spade a spade. thank you"
2,VERY OVERRATED,"OKay i love metal but these guys are good and talented but they are so overated i mean its like they are""the BAckstreet Boys"" of metal Matt Heafy does sound like a retarded guy when he trys to scream i mean there are so many bands that dont sound like retards. I personally dont like mEtalcore i mean they are one of the better ones but come on The American Metal scence is being over run by Metalcore bands !!! Only a few American guys are staying true to metal(Iced earth, Cannibal Corpse,Immoltaion,Nevermore ,FOur Gods of thrash Etc) BUt it seems Eurpean metal is overall far better than American metal. Metal has never died it just moved to Europe (Find Me one Europe Metalcore Band ahahhah )"
5,AWESOME! ANY QUESTIONS?,What needs to be said other than this band is just awesome. This is one killer CD that will blow you away from start to begining. I had never heard them and just got this on a whim more or less but it was no waste of money by any means. This band and this CD will tear your walls down so go get it NOW!
1,"Okay, but nothing great","I heard this album a few times through, and I just can't get over the vocals. They sound horrible. The music is not bad, but it could be a lot better. I would never buy this album, I can listen to them every once in a while on myspace. After listening to Rob Rock, Theocracy, Dragonforce, Beyond Fear and so many others. This album is good for a listen or 2, if you can stomach the vocals, but thats about it."
1,I wish there was a no star rating.,"It's bands like Trivium that make people hate metalcore. Seriously. I've heard ""Like Light to the Flies"" and that's all I needed to hear from this awful band. Ever. They have terrible vocals, and typical pop-metalcore singing parts. They're basically every metalcore band you've ever heard, recycled, but 10 times worse. Do not waste your time and money listening to this horrible band, forget how good Headbanger's Ball and Jamey Jasta said they were, and get a quality metalcore release instead."
1,Terrible,"Terrible unoriginal rip-off band. Bought the album after hearing about it from a friend. Metalcore!!If you like metalcore I would recommend this album, because it's got everything metalcore is about.But if you like decent real metal then it should be avoided!"
2,Repetitive,"I can't believe so many people think this deserves more than 2 stars. What is the big deal about this band anyway? The fact they're young, or that they sound like early Sepultura? There is nothing new here, the singing has been done before and yawn yawn yawn, until something really blows me away like Kill 'Em All did by Metallica, I won't be glorifying this band. After 20 years of listening to metal, I am still not impressed.If they're the future of metal they need to make sure the following album doesn't sound so bloody repetitive."
3,Half decent at best,"Much like Killswitch Engage and Atreyu, Trivium was another band that has been heralded as the best thing to hit the genre in years. And while ""Ascendancy"" isn't bad one bit, it's far from being the ""metal masterpiece of the new milennium"". Featuring the same formulaic vocal style to be found on albums by the aforementioned bands (screaming followed by a catchy, well sung chorus) and some greart guitar work, Trivium offers nothing new on tracks like ""Rain"", ""Drowned and Torn Asunder"", and ""Dying in Your Arms"", while ""Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr"" is a great, solid headbanger. As a group, Trivium has the talent to make it big, but there's hardly any real originality here to seperate them from the rest of the pack. All in all, Trivium's ""Ascendancy"" is worth a listen for newer metal heads, but it's nothing special in the least."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The other reviewers are right - this dog of a book should never have been published. In fact it seems to have been published by the author himself by way of a vanity press. Well, he shouldn't have wasted his time or his money, and I shouldn't have wasted mine. This author knows NOTHING about philosophy, but that doesn't stop him from complaining REPEATEDLY that philosophers are a bunch of idiots. If possible, he's even more ignorant (and prouder of it) than Rand herself."
5,Join the Club &#65533; Books 1 & 2,"An essential addition to any English language learner's or teacher's collection! I have been teaching ESL/EFL for over twelve years and was yet to find a comprehensive text to teach idioms. Then I discovered the Join the Club series, the first texts that did not have to be supplemented or modified. The numerous high-frequency expressions are made easy for students to learn through example sentences, useful exercises, fun games, listening comprehension activities, new ideas, etc. Moreover, the texts are ideal for busy teachers since they basically serve as ""kits."" Everything is there; there is no need to come up with exciting, new ways to make the instruction enjoyable. The students immediately respond and have fun learning. In sum, a must have for students and teachers alike!"
3,ambicious girl fighting for her dream,"Although this book had a lot of meaning, It was a little boring. We enjoyed how it entered a real teenaged girl's life. It is very realistic. Even though we thought it was boring, we liked how it taught you to fight for your dream. We thought it was boring because the sentences didn't really flow together. It was kind of like a girl writing in her diary. It was also kind of corny. It was kind of dumb too because all she wanted to do was be a dancer. She had nothing else to back her up, like college. She got a lot of scholarships and offers to join schools. She didn't take them because she wanted to be in a company. We realize this is harsh but it's true.It was written on a low level for 3rd graders to read but no 3rd grader should ever read this book. Some of the stuff in the book was a little unneccesery. Like the drinking and the smoking.In conclusion, the book had a lot of meaning but was still a little cheasy."
5,Ballet is Life,"This novel is so easy to relate to if you are a teenage ballerina. Stephanie, a sixteen year old loves ballet to bits. She chases her dream through struggle. Her dad is anti ballet as he thinks its better to have a better career and her mother is the same. The lady who really captures her admiration is Ms. Winnie, a retired dancer. Her nephew, Vance also knows how to do ballet and the pair make a great pas de deux couple. Read this fabulous book to feel part of the world of ballet."
2,Zoya,"The movie was very good, the only thing bad was that the DVD kept pausing. That made watching it very annoying."
1,Kirov Ballet in 1917..........,"What a fake!Zoya comes to audition to Diaghilev's company in Paris and tells to - hm.. well... looks like to Anna Pavlova: "" Before I left Russia I worked for what you call here Kirov Ballet""...Sergei Kirov was a member of Russian Communist Party, he was killed in 1931 and only after that the former Mariinsky Theatre was renamed in his honor.. I do not understand how such mistake could be commemorated in a relatively well done movie... But probably it's worth it to buy this DVD just to enjoy hearing this line over and over again...Danielle Steel is famous of not caring about historical facts, her other ""Gem Of Fake "" about Russia - ""Granny Dan ""..."
2,Zoya,Received DVD immediately. I guess it is a TV series that was taped and then transferred to DVD because the quality of the film was not ideal. But still worth the price because my mother really wanted the story.
2,korea relived on moon,"It is a common opinion that the first season of Outer Limits, under the direction of its original creators, was stronger than the second season. It is, however, also apparent that towards the end of first season the series wasn't as consistently good as in the beginning.The Moonstone has plenty of values to keep it watchable: the actors are adequate, the production classy and the special effects (especially the moonstone itself) are among the best in the entire series. For once the aliens are portrayed as truly ALIEN in form. Also it has an unusually realistic ending, no superheroics, once again showing how intellectual this series was.There are no moments of stupidity or embarrasment, but unfortunately, for some reason, Moonstone fails to be very exciting or gripping. The characters aren't that interesting and the story lacks that ""awe and mystery"" advertised in the title sequence...however, the episode is definitely worth watching."
3,Outer Limits does it again.,"Believe it or not, this episode of ""The Outer Limits"" was inspired by a streetlight that may or may not been illegally obtained. But no matter: once again, the pure genius of both Joseph Stefano and Leslie Stevens shines through as they give us a story of tiny fugitive aliens trying to find shelter from their oppressors and the humans in between.Not for beginners of the ""Limits,"" but perfect for well-seasoned veterans of Sci-Fi."
2,mediocre text not worth the money,"I've never owned any other texts on probability and statistics, but this one is no good. The underlying mathematical concepts are not difficult, but they are presented in a very poor manner. I often have to read a section several times to understand how the authors move from the theory to a specific examples, they seem to leave out steps that aren't intuitive to the first time student (me). Then, once I think I undestand the ideas sufficiently to move to the exercises at the end of the section, I find that they often ask the reader to solve problems the likes of which were barely (or sometimes not at all) explained in the text... its VERY aggrevating. This text, combined with a terrible Prof. has made Prob-Stat a real nightmare ...if you want to safe yourself a lot of time and frustration, get another book, its almost garaunteed to be better....."
2,Not Clear,"As a beginner, I found this book not clearly written. Some conceptes are written into text without any highlight. I had to read through some parts for several times to make sure that I understand the content. I replied on professor's notes. But, maybe it is just because I used this book for my first statistic class."
1,THIS BOOK DOES NOT HELP,"Everything in this book is very unclear, with vague examples. The text is 98% Math and 2%English which makes it difficult for the students to comprehend whats going on."
3,Partial review...,"This reviewer feels compelled to comment after completing only through chapter 5. Why? Because, like another reviewer's book, this one had ""fallen apart"" midway through a semester's work! The sections became unglued from the book's spine. Since this reviewer does not abuse books, one might question whether Prentice Hall buys inferior glue. The book's premium price demands a more sturdy product. Otherwise, the copious exercises of varying difficulty comprise the text's greatest asset (so far). More to follow at the end of next semester!"
1,Pretty confusing,"I used this book in a 300 level mathematics course. Before taking this class, I had taken 2 applied business statistics courses. However, many parts of this book were very confusing despite the fact I was not totally ignorant of statistics. Some of the ""simpler"" statistics concepts are made unnecessarily difficult by the authors. The notations used are not labeled well or at all, and the authors tend to skip steps when solving problems. I have taken 3 calculus classes yet the calculus used in this book confused me, again the authors skipped steps and did not explain what they were doing. I know a lot of math textbooks are not very clear but this one is the worst I have ever read. Maybe okay for math majors, but not for the rest of us!"
1,Don't buy this book!,There are good books on probability and statistical inference. This isn't one of them! If you are hunting for something - look for authors like James T. McClave or P. George Benson. James McClave has written some good books in this area.Examples are HARD TO FOLLOW. There is no development of concepts. The writer doesn't seem to have any idea how to explain or how to provide examples. THIS IS NOT A BOOK THAT NORMAL PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND! IF YOU LIKE MATH OR WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND MATH - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! It does provide an example of what a book shouldn't look like!
1,Awful,"If this is the 6th edition, I don't want to see the 1st edition! This book takes the simplest concepts and makes them convoluted and confusing; it lacks proper organization and repeats similar concepts chapter after chapter.Please, if you are a professor looking at using this book to teach a class, consider others. I don't understand why it is so popular."
2,a (yawn) mechanical approach to mathematics,"I studied the first 8 chapters of this book instead of attending the undergraduate lecture. This was a mistake. Tanis & Hoggs present probability and statistics, an otherwise interesting topic, in the most mechanical way imaginable. There is no reference (that I can recall) to any underlying mathematical ideas or questions, nor to the problems which originially prompted Poisson, Bernoulli, Gauss, etc. to inquire about the nature of ""randomness"" in physical events. The authors seem to suppose that their examples demonstrate such things by proxy. This book may make a decent reference for advanced students, but should not be used to teach those seeing prob & stat for the first time... that is, unless, you want it to also be their last."
2,not fit for teaching,"While studying statistics with this book I thougth I lack a gene or something because I couldn't make much sense of the subject. Today I know that the book is conceptually wrong.The book is basically stuck in the 1930's, ignoring major breakthroughs by Shannon, Kolmogorov and others. Fundamental concepts like entropy, individual randomness and typicallity are completely missing.Furthermore, the book is heavily biased towards hypothesis testing, with little mentioning of Bayesian statistics.From a pedagogic point of view it must be said that statistical concepts emerged historically and are better understood when placed in the context of the original problems. This book does not do that at all."
1,Illogic organization and non-intuitive explanation,"i'm not sure whether it's useful as a reference, but it's far from being a good textbook. obviously the authors didn't care to explain anything clearly. all they wanted was to write down all the relevant formulas to finish their book. no intuition is given at all. it's a pain to read and i would recommend both instructors and students NOT to use this book."
1,The WORST prob & stats book !!,I feel much better after reading other reviews of this book - I am not the only one or the reason for this . This book is very deficient . . Especially for undergraduate learners .
3,"good book, old edition","The book arrived in expected condition; my only complaint is that- it is a much older edition. It hasn't been a problem so far, but I am only a chapter through the book."
2,Probability and Statistical Inference,"I had to buy this for a class b/c Hogg & Tanis renumbered the problems (same problems, but put different numbers on them) this was done so they could sell another edition! Other than that nothing really has changed, good money making technique though."
4,Trains can be frustrating,"We got this train as a gift for our 21 mo old son from his grandparents. He loved it immediately and was easily able to manipulate the train. However, we also found that it would run off the track at the same point every time!! It was so frustrating and dissapointing that we had my parents return it. If you spend ... on a wooden train set, you want it to work and to last! My brother also had the same porblem with his set."
3,Frustrating Toy!,This toy is a big waste of money. It is too difficult for a 3 year old. Everytime my son attempts to put the trains back on the track the tracks start falling apart. The trains fall off all of the time. Don't waste your money your child will only end up frustrated.
1,Another example of racial stereotyping a community....,"This movie is just another example of hollywood industry's vilification and demonization of Muslims as a race, as a community. I happen to be a unitarian universalist, but that does not give me any right to judge all muslims are extremists. It is the sick indoctrination that is to be condemned, and not the faith."
2,"Decent, but","I think the acting in this movie is generally good, but I am not one to agree with the intent of the movie.Everyone in life has problems, and many people other than muslims have problems just as bad, without resorting to terrorist activities. Every human has choices to make no matter what their living condition. This movie does not make me feel any sympathy for the plight of the character.My personal feeling is that I wish those who support terrorism and are actively involved would die out, along with the idea. Some things are better dead, and the idea of terrorism is one of them. Humanity could go much further without it."
1,not for chewers,"My 8-month old, 45 pound shepherd/hound mix broke the squeaker in about a minute, and had chewed thru the ball in less than 5 minutes."
3,Hard to follow but I blame subtittles,"I give this DVD 3 stars, not for the film itself but because the subtitles were confusing at best. I liked this film but it was hard to follow due to the poor translation. I don't think they did a very good job translating the film into English. I would have liked to have been able to choose subtitles in Spanish. Maybe I would have understood it better. Russian film makers should be told to have more than one language available for DVD releases in the United States. Otherwise, the film is charming. If I had understood more of what was being said, I probably would have given it four stars."
4,Good for people who want to know more about our universe!,I have come to expect that virtually any publication bearing Dr. Tyson's name is well worth the time and expense to acquire and enjoy. Merlin's Tour of the Universe clearly meets that standard. There is lots to learn through this well-written book!
3,1/2 hour of fun,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my 7 year old daughter. She was very excited at first and eagerly sat down and colored all the figures. It held her attention all through the coloring process. Her only complaint was that there were not enough varity of colors to choose from. Our home markers did not work.The low rating comes from the fact that once she was done coloring the figures she lost interest. I recently asked her if she wanted another set and she told me no, because it's boring.I recommend this toy if you need a time filler like on a car trip or need a quick fix to keep your child quiet for about 1/2 hour. But it has no real long term play value."
4,**** Hot anticipation****,I like this story. The heroine Serena is an undercover cap as dominatrix who seduced Nick O'Malley thinking that he is a criminal. Nick made a 30 days wager of NO SEX with his friends. He made it for 29 days. But when Serena shows up dressing on leather at his hotel room; could he make to the 30 days? Or will that be the longeeeest night of his life. The story was funny and hot. I love Jennifer Labrecque writting. I hope you enjoy this book as well.
4,Good for general information,I found this is a good supplementary book that fills in some of the information not provided in the classroom textbooks.
4,Good Find,This book is well written and informative. It is a little dated but the information is accurate none the less. It is a really good resource.
4,Great Item,This product was exactly what I was looking for and met all my expectations. Will definitely shop here again for more.
2,After arrival~,"I knew that the book was used, but i didnt expect there to be(horrible)pen lines and highlight markings already in the book. Besides that, the book was pretty presentable. Thanks anyway~"
1,Not What I expected,"The ETTA booklet sent is fine for the audience intended. It is a simplified version of the Tenny/Dunnett college textbook which is what I wanted and fully expected to receive. The merchant should have made it clear in the description that the item was the ETTA booklet, not a New Testament college level textbook. For that reason, I give not the book, but the seller a one star."
4,"How to guide to watching ""Hula Workout"":","1: To get full benifit from these DVDs I recomend buying an aerobic dance DVD and learning all the moves they do, then mentally subtracting them from Kili's routine so you have a more-or-less authentic version of hula technique.2: Although the music is cheesey (a lot) it is authentic Hawaiian... post Elvis. If you can stand it, the music gives clues to how the arms function in relation to lyrics although the tune is more American '60s pop than Island ballad. Kili's other DVDs (Island Girl Dance Fitness Workout for Beginners: Cardio Hula) use drum choruses and the story-telling gets lost without context.3: Kili is filming in Hawaii. Its 80* or so, her muscles won't need to warm up or cool down as much as those of us who spend our Wisconson winters dreaming of tropical dance parties. Run those sections twice."
5,Great workout!,"This fitness workout is challenging and fun. If you have never done any hula, you'll be surprise how fun it can be. This workout teaches you some basic hula steps and intensifies the workout with other fitness moves. The background is in beautiful Maui and the instructor is excellant. Hula is much harder than it looks and can give you a great alternative to your everyday workout."
4,Good teacher,"Kili is a very good instructor, especially for an overweight, out of shape novice. My only objection is that there are lots of close-up shots where you can't see her entire body in motion. I'm sure that was to create interest in the video, but it's annoying. Hawaii is beautiful scenery; no reason to cut off her head or her feet."
2,Hokey & Cheesy,"I own 2 other workouts by Kali that are wonderful and have really nice traditional style drumming.These DVD's have some horribly cheesy music that in my opinion would make Don Ho sick.Hope the workouts are decent, honestly I haven't had the guts to try them yet - it is really that hokey."
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed with these dvd's. The info on them doesn't mention that they're far from being traditional hula. The music in the weight loss one isn't bad, but I couldn't stand the song on the beginner dvd. The warm-up was practically nonexistant. When doing this kind of dance, your muscles really need to be much more warmed up than what Kili does. I also thought that she needed to break down the movement more. Even with a dance background, I thought she went much too quickly, so I can only imagine how difficult it would be for someone with no dance experience at all. Unfortunatly, there doesn't seem to be an alternate dvd out yet for someone who wants to learn real hula."
1,I Want My Money Back!!!!,"This workout should be thrown out! I can't begin to say how very disapointed I was. Yes,I did sweat however if you are a beginner of any kind you could really hurt yourself doing this ""work out"" No real warm up or cool down, not to mention the ""Disney"" like music. If this is Hulu I don't want to learn it."
4,Garmin 240,"The Garmin 240 is an excellent value. It is your best bet for under 300.00. It is extremely easy to install, only a one cable hook up. The High Resolution display is top of the line. The display of the thermocline is great when it works. The transducer has given me problems. But overall it is an awesome value."
5,Cheng Sheng Herbal Rejuvenating Beauty Soap,I think this soap is excellent. I am using it for my rosacea and it has helped with the redness and bumpiness that comes with rosacea. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my skin continues to improve. I would recommend this soap to anyone with rosacea. The price is good as well.
5,Essential for Rosacea and severe acne,"I have a skin condition called Rosacea that worsens if I go any amount of time without using this soap. I've tried all kinds of acne cures, and nothing works as well as this product. The Chang Sheng soap is a weaker version of the Democidin soap, and is the best place to start. The Democidin is really strong and only for severe skin problems -- even then you may want to switch off between them.This company also makes a Chang Sheng cream which helps keep the skin clear (I swear it makes you look younger if you use it as a night cream) and a shampoo which I haven't tried yet. The cream smells a little weird, so I only use it at night.I'm so pleased to see this available on Amazon! It's often hard to find and I don't like to run out of it. 2 bars cost as much as $40. elsewhere, so this is a good bargain if the shipping is reasonable."
5,I love this soap,"I love this soap. I am using this kind of soap probably for 10 years. It really works. I bought it to work with my rosacea and eczema. I use it not only for my face, but for whole body too. Sometimes I stop using it, but when I use it regularly for my face it works with clearing some wrinkles too. I would definitely recommend this soap."
5,Worth the cost,"I discovered this soap over 15 years ago. It's difficult to find, and yes, expensive (it wasn't cheap 15 yrs ago either). But if you don't like to take powerful medications for what is a visually unattractive but non-fatal skin condition like rosacea, this soap is worth the cost. A bar will last a long time, as it's hard-milled. I use a liquid soap for washing hands, and only use the Chang Seng bar for daily face-cleansing. One bar lasts almost a year for me - certainly no more expensive than antibiotics, and much more biologically/ecologically friendly."
3,Great soap - shameful business.,"I'll get this out of the way, the soap is great to help with flare-ups, no doubt about that.What's ashame is the fact that I paid $8 to ship a bar of soap (see other reviews) from NJ to PA and when the mail man shows up he leaves a envelope telling me I have to cover the shipping shortfall for the company.They have been less than responsive in fixing the situation.Bottom line - if you can find the soap elsewhere, I suggest you do..."
3,Not To Provocative,"Agent Provocateur is Foreigner's follow up to their number one hit, 4. It was tough task to follow up that great album and they don't manage to do so with this album. While there are some very good songs, overall the album is just average. ""I Want To Know What Love Is"" is the band's biggest hit and it is a very pretty song that contains singing from the Newark Gospel Choir that adds a beautiful and heartbreaking touch to the song. It became the band's only number one single. Despite the balladry of that song, the album is basically made up of rockers that are drenched too heavily in synthesizers with ""That was Yesterday"" and ""Reaction To Action"" standing out."
3,Foreigner 5.,"""Agent Provacateur"", Foreigner's follow-up to their massive ""4"" album, contains two great rockers ('Tooth and Nail', 'Reaction to Action') and their spectacular gospel-flavored ballad 'I Want to Know What Love Is', along with several cheesy mid-tempo ballads featuring a very 80's synth backdrop. The band's descent into safe, middle-of the road lite rock can be traced back to this album. This was the last gasp (musically speaking) of one of the 1970's great arena rock bands."
4,Overlooked Foreigner classics,"Lots of classic material but not enough classics to rate five stars.Foreigner always had great material and I especially liked this album.It isn't over-produced,giving it a very raw,heavier sound and I think this was great direction for them at time.I thought the anthology was a bit dissapointing that it didn't show the bands heavier side and include great tracks such as,Tooth and Nail,Stranger in my own House and Growing up the Hard Way.I know some fans didn't agree with the direction of this album, but it shows a different side of them.They did change again for the next album,but it lacked what this album had.I still think IWTKWLI is a fantastic ballad and I crank this one up every time I hear it.I still love ""That was Yesterday"" and Mick did some great things with the synths on this album.I'd like to hear more like this with a little of all the classic material mixed in.For a new fan I'd suggest starting at the beginning of their career."
3,Double Standard,"Agent Provocateur has some of my favorite Foreigner songs of all time, That Was Yesterday, I Want To Know What Love Is, Down On Love but as a album as a whole it sounds split asunder. It seems as if it were made by two different bands. Reaction To Action particularly is a disaster. Not only Lou's vocal was not right but it was misplaced. It should be right next to Tooth And Nail which is a cool rocker. Only reason I gave this album three star is songs included are great but the album could have been much better."
2,Too Slick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I shouldn't tear this album up too much (hey, it was released in the mid 80's.) Foreigner always represented BIG arena rock and then they released ""4"". Yes it was a real rockin' album, but it was also their departure into more of a MOR approach, which leads to ""Agent Provocateur"", Foreigner fifth album of new material. Produced by the late Alex Sadkin, the album seemed too mechanical on the rockin' tunes (tooth and nail, she's too tough, reaction to action.) I can barely hear any guitar on the slower numbers (I want to know what love is, a love in vain, that was yesterday, two different worlds.) Like I said earlier, this record came out in the mid 80's and like a lot of other great bands they fell victim to a very mechanized sound and production. But a lot of people bought it and it contains their only number 1 hit (I want to know what love is.)"
2,"Except for the two hits, this is total swill to me","I bought this not long after it came out in 1984 but got rid of it quick because it was so bad. Don't listen to the reviewer Darth Kommissar who said that this was severely underrated. It's not thought of very highly for a reason. The only thing that I like a lot from this album is the song ""That Was Yesterday"". I can kind of stomach the song ""I Want to know what love is"", but it's a little to syrupy and sweet for my taste. So basically those two tunes bring this review rating up to two stars. I hate the song ""Tooth And Nail"" and I think there's another song called ""Reaction to Action"" that's very bad too. Just stick with the albums from 1977 to 1981 because everything that came after was definitely substandard."
2,great pianist roughly treated by the cameras,"gulda, who died recently,is shown playing some mozart solos on this 58 minute dvd program from 1990. he gives great pleasure but the visuals are too variable and often distracting - too many visible mikes, speakers, pianos plus unnecessary announcements from the artist. this looks like carelessness to me. if you want to see this pianist in performance a better bet is his dvd of the k.466 and k.537 concerti."
4,Country Garden- Nice Clean Scent,Product has a nice clean scent and eliminates odors extremely well and fast!
2,Sorry if your taking a class that uses this one,This book is an incredibly hard read. The program that I took used this book and even the instructor said it sucked. Those of us already in the industry use much more complex methods and they are explained way more simply than this mass of words.
5,Great Book,This book was very insightful for the Supply Chain and Logistics majors. I learned much of what I know on the subject from this book.
5,GREAT!!,"If you love the Alice series then this books for you. If you've never read the Alice series pick this book up. It's funny, has teen romance(which I love!), and it's all around great. It's only about 120 pages but length doesn't matter when a books of really gret quality."
4,Achingly Alice,"Over all, Achingly Alice was a really good book. Alice is trying to figure out how Mrs. Summers can love Mr. Sorringer and her dad at the same time, while she herself can't decide between Patrick (her boyfriend) and the cutie in her camera class, Sam. It's easy to relate to this book because it's set in present times in Silver Springs. Alice finally decides to wait it out and see what happens in the end when something suprising happens to Miss Summers. I would reccomend this book to girls ages twelve and up because of some of the things that happen to Alice and her friends. They are in eighth grade, so that is probably a good age to read this book."
2,Well it's live,"I'm sorry I have to write this report, since I always have a burning desire and love to support good christian efforts in evolving gospel music. But this VHS has been a great disappointment to me. I wouldn't recomment to buy this unless you are a great Kim Burrell fan. I feel the music and singing needs grounding - espeacially in the first half. The singing is way too much out of tune, which I wouldn't matter if I felt a strong spirit in it. In addition she phrases all the time which is giving me a konstant feeling of stress so focusing on the lyrics seems impossible. Also the sound mix is very bad, so in general I must say: Yes, it's live indeed. Again I'm sorry to write this because it's the first time I've ever had a bad experience with a live video, and I know their intentions of making the protject must be good."
4,"Fun show, upbeat adventure series","Tia is at her best in this fun series; it's exciting and well worth watching. Like ""Tomb Raider meets Indiana Jones"" with a likable cast, this is a well-done series that doesn't take itself too seriously. With a variety of stories to enjoy, Relic Hunter is a solid tv adventure series that's upbeat, interesting and fun to watch. It's fun to see the globetrotting locations and adventure stories played out in each episode; it's well-made and worth seeing.-k"
3,Relic Hunter top notch but missing first episode,I received the box of DVDs as it is a set. The first episode was missing. Wasn't happy with the outcome. I still have the boxed set without the first episode. I wish I had written this review sooner. I apologize for not doing so.
4,Eminently Enjoyable,"Someone else taged this 'archeological cheesecake' (tut, tut: what about the beefcake thrown in? Equality of the sexes, please...) but with enough factual basis to make it interesting as well as fun, and Lindy Booth's performances were pure gravy.I did feel mislead by the product information, which made me think I was getting the complete series. In fact 7 or 8 of the first, establishing episods are missing as well many later ones. Pity."
3,missing relics,well i guess some people might be grateful for just some of the episodes not me is it really that hard to release the entire series there are 22 episodes missing so they really have only released one season and whether these episodes are better then the excluded ones is probably debatable as your favourites usually differ from the ones making the decisions as for the missing episodes that looks like a job for adventure inc. no sign of that show either
4,Neil loves it!,My grandson loves Thomas and all things related to trains so I am happy to have chosen this toy for him. It also teaches him about recycling and the many professionals involved in its processing.
1,BAD MOVIE,THE movie had several dead spots which were not playable which made it hard to play or watch. It should have been inspected before selling
1,Disappointed,I was quite disappointed with this purchase. I ordered the version that is pictured but that is not the version that I received. I received a more modern version but I wanted the original one. I had been looking for this movie for quite a while. Sooooooo disappointed!
3,No greater love..,"This film lacks a LOT of the book. It is only an hour and a half long so they have had to rush through a lot of details. There is a little bit of language, drug use and a bedroom scene. I wouldn't say this movie is for the whole family. If you are just looking for a little entertainment then this movie is for you."
2,"Looks nice, but has a major design flaw","Perhaps my GM truck is unique is some way, but the threads for the battery aren't long enough to engage properly, and on the positive terminal only go in 1 thread before it starts to tighten, and of course will strip that one thread pretty quickly. I've inspected the cables and battery and there's nothing extra in there blocking it from working properly, the original battery bolts are about 3 threads longer and tighten up just fine, but these (and others I've used) fall short.If you were using these to make a connection to a side post battery without battery cables, they would work fine, so if you're using them on a coach battery and they aren't holding a large battery cable, they would work fine, which is perhaps how they were intended to be used (except that they do appear to have been designed to fit the battery cables)."
5,Perfect,"I originally ordered a Monster brand side post. I didn't realize it was the extra long version and was too long for the battery. This one, is however perfect and allows me to hook up my amps to my terrible side post battery."
4,Great for dander & shedding great for between baths for your pets,Fast shipment. works great. cheaper than in the stores. I love this product which I've used this same product in the past but it was in the teal color fragance which I really love but was unable to locate it online so I decided to tried the purple color fragance not my favorite but works. Wish I could locate the teal fragance. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because its not the fragance of my choice.
3,Dazed and Confused.,"I'm just beginning acting classes and I just picked this book by simply leafing through. When I got home and actually looked through it, I became so nervous because I couldn't find anything I felt I could use. If you have the chance, look at the book before you buy it."
4,Solid old blues,"Johnny Temple had one of the strongest voices in early blues, though he is little known today. One can hear the some of the same phrasing in Temple's vocals as one can hear on some of Robert Johnson's recordings. These later recordings are made with a variety of other musicians, including Lonnie Johnson on some of the tracks playing very subtle guitar behind Temple's strong voice. The only limitation to Temple's work seems to be that he repeatedly recorded songs with the same melody, even though the lyrics may be vastly different. His lyrics are usually interesting, but hearing several songs with the melody of Bukka White's ""Shake 'Em on Down"" gets a little tiring."
3,Great Beginners Set,"The Pure Power and Pure Sweat titles of two of the DVDs led me to purchase this set. If you practice flow or power yoga regularly these dvds won't be enough. If you are a beginner, go for it, these dvds are for you. The setting is good and Rainbeau is a good teacher, great beginners set."
5,Awesome Awesome Awesome,"I just tried out one video from this series, the yoga ""Sweat"", and I can't say enough about it. As a intermediate yoga'er, I wanted something slightly more challenging, and more of a workout. This is it. This is also one of the few videos that really gives you the mind connection from yoga along with great instruction. This video, however, is NOT FOR BEGINNERS, although please keep in mind that I haven't tried the other tapes from the set, so I'm sure they might be better for beginners, and if so, this set would follow a beginner for a very long time. Definitely worth it."
2,Short and sweet should be for dessert,"If I had known how short the videos are, I would have thought twice about buying them. The material is fine but the length sucks. Just know the practices are only about a half an hour."
4,Does God despise our assemblies?,"Amos 5:21-25 is quoted above and in the book as we often think of worship as the time in which we assemble together. But that is exactly the point of Dr.Byrd's book. In a very quick and often entertaining read, we move through many scriptural passages that can change our minds about what God desires from us in order to truly worship him. Read the book to see how yes, even dead opossum, can be part of true biblical worship -not at all what you might normally think."
5,A warm story of Germany and rabbits,"This is the most charming book I have come across in years, and I can't wait to read the original in German (available now on amazon.de for about $30.) The combination of master storytelling by Dische and Enzensberger and Sowa's richly surreal art is mesmerizing. The story is light, simple, and very rewarding. You will return again and again to this story of a rabbit traveling through modern Germany. It brings back memories of my time in both East and West Germany, around the wall. When I read it, I smile and feel better."
5,Charming story....amazing illustrations!,"The story of little Prince Esterhazy is so simple and charming, sure to delight young and old. We bought the book because we are huge fans of Michael Sowa's art. The illustrations are at the same time surreal and precious; a bunny trying on boxer shorts? A bunny in the bathtub? Fantastic! And the poignant story of a bunny finding love as the wall falls in Berlin is too sweet."
1,Tastes *nothing* like Sencha!,"For anyone who is a seasoned Sencha tea drinker, this is tea is a total dud. It barely tastes anything like fresh, high quality Sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves. I had to throw this in the trash because it's simply dreadful."
3,"good tea, bad bags","This is great sencha tea with just a hint of orange. Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient. It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however. They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can."
3,Need to be improved.,"Although, they work in salt water, but I think the limbs should be tougher than the body as the very small fishes remove them easily leaving the rest of the crab shapeless. So, I recommend using a little bit harder material."
4,"This one's worth watching, and buying...","There are many movies made where a grandparent (usually a grandfather) is forced to step in and make a difference in the life of a grandchild who has a bad attitude. Generally in these stories, something traumatic has happened to the grandchild, usually the death of a parent. An animal, an experience - in this movie it's a river trip - is the crux that somehow gets through to the grandchild, sets him or her straight, and makes the aggravation involved worthwhile for all.Although there are a couple others I could recommend in this category, I'm personally most impressed with this one by way of acting quality and interesting storyline. Definitely worth a watch, and after watching twice as a rental, I'm buying it!"
5,Great book,I bought this for a friend who has two young boys. He absolutely loved the book and was so thankful to me for getting it for him to read to his children.
5,"If you think the actors had fun, shoulda seen the writers room","It's interesting to see how much people liked the later seasons more than the first two, but speaking as a writer who worked on every episode along with Ron Solomon and Brett Dewey, it was the last few shows of the second season when Dreams hit its stride, finding its bizarre, broad tone. I'm not sure any episode is better than the second season's western musical. Admittedly, it's only after the Garrisons depart that we get to see Gary Beach sell used cars or that PCH's transie principal and monomaniacal vice principal appear. I loved the actors, I loved their characters, and the shows are a reflection of the writers room's tomato fights, water guns, and barefoot dance contests late-night atop Hollywood's Gower Studios. There were a lot of NBC-Peter Engel sitcoms going on at the time, but we were the only ones sticking Kick Me tags on Peter Engel's back at run-thrus."
5,I love this show!!!,"I have waited soo long for this show to finally come out on DVD. It was so worth the wait, I still love it! I just hope that the rest of the seasons are released."
5,Loved to watch this show when I was a Kid! Still Do as an Adult,Loved to watch this when i was a kid miss it wish it never was taken off the air.
4,Is that the cover?,"FINALLY! I've been waiting for this show for years! Didn't really like this show until the later episodes with Sam, Lorena and Mark, but at least it's one step closer to those seasons being released! Will definately buy this to ensure they continue to release this series on DVD.HOWEVER, is that really the cover to the DVD?! Jake and Sam are badly photoshopped on. JAKE HAS TWO LEFT HANDS on that cover...one ""holding"" Tony's shoulder and another left hand on his pocket..."
5,Great Show,"California Dreams was one of my favorite shows when I was younger and I'm so happy that they have released seasons 1 and 2. You can see a dramatic difference between Season 1 and 2 and how the show was becoming a teen show focusing on their adventures at school and the band than The Garrison family. Some great episodes and music videos(California Dreams) came from Season One: This Time, Guess Who's Coming To Brunch, and The First Gig. I loved the Music Videos but as you can see they took them out of Seaason 2. In Season 2, the introduction of Jake and Samantha was a great addition but I truly loved Jenny and was sad to see her leave the show, she in my opinion is the best female singer on the show. Season 2 had great episodes: Ciao, Jenny, Dirty Dogs, and Indecent Promposal."
3,know what your getting,this was not the angel for men frangrance that i wanted but for the scent & such an inexpensive price for the quanity it's a good buy.
3,Too stong,"I didnt like the smell too much it feels to strong, but for the price and with the refill option it might be ok for a work fragance."
5,DO YOURSELF A FAVOR,IF ALL MY CD'S WERE STOLEN.....THE FIRST ONES I WOULD REPLACE WOULD BE THE THREE COMPOSITIONS FROM OPETH....LIFE W/ OUT HAVING HEARD THEM WOULD SIMPLY BE ORDINARY....I THOUGHT THE MUSIC WORLD WAS NEAR ITS END UNTIL OPETH.... NOW I AWAIT THE NEXT RELEASE.....MAINSTREAMERS SMACK YOURSELVES FOR NOT ACCEPTING THIS KIND OV MUSIC................
5,morningrise,"every song on here is excellent. to me, there is no average song on this cd and the bass guitar is the best i have ever heard. i wish this bassist had stayed with opeth. get this cd now. Nectar is my favorite song on here."
5,For completists only,"The extra track (""Eternal Soul Torture"") is a very rough-sounding, almost demo-quality song. Doesn't really fit in with the scheme of the rest of the album. Nonetheless, it's a great tune, and this is a must-have for Opeth fanatics. Newer fans may not appreciate it as much."
4,Really nice death metal music,"This Opeth release has lots of promise, despite the fact that the vocals sometimes sound like Satan singing with laryngitis. The instrumental playing is really good and there a lot here that is very pleasing indeed. This album really grows on you....."
5,More From Opeth!!,"Morningrise can be seen as a logical progression of the sound that Opeth had on their debut Orchid. It's not all that different, yet has an identity all it's own.The sound is a bit more refined this time, and the guitars are a bit ""warmer"" in sound. The vocals are still killer, bordering on death/black, but nice amounts of clean vocals are thrown in to further increase the amazing atmosphere of these songs. Advent, and Black Rose Immortal are personal favorites, but the whole album is amazing.I can't begin to describe the actual music on this disc, simple accolades are not enough. This album truly gets better after every listen, and I still enjoy after 3 years. This album should be in every metal fans collection."
2,Tries to hard to find that moment of brilliance that they don't capture until the albums after this,"I didn't mind ""Orchid"" too much, sure some of the songs on it were a bit too long, but they had interesting melodies and really proudly showed Opeth's influences, but ""Morningrise"" is definitely a step back and nothing like the absolutely brilliant ""MAYH"". Besides the decent, but 20 minute long, ""Black Rose Immortal"" there is nothing really great on this album. This album is filled with half baked ideas scattered throughout which cause Morningrise to really lack a clear mood that Opeth somehow captures after letting go the drummer and bassist for some Hispanic geniuses."
5,YES YES AND GUESS WHAT YES,opeth opeth opeth in my opinion this is there best album there other work is pretty damn good as well many people including cridicts think that opeth is the best band in the world well damn i dont agree but there up there competeing for that title and over the years they have made a great name for themselves so morning rise is probley there most melodic album yet and i love it its pure geniuse nice harsh vocal killer guitar and awsome acoustics in the mix clean vocals it is truley an elite album anyone looking for a good metal album look no further you listen to and you will see what i am talking about hope the review helped
2,Expected better...,"I heard nothing but good reviews for Opeth, But i personally was dissapointed. The five tracks are all atleast 10 minutes long, the longest going for 20, and this would be ok if the songs actually flowed, but instead it sounds like the intro to several good metal songs have been pasted together while someone growls over it. The music itself is actually quite good, but after a while it starts to drag on and become quite boring, each time the songs build up i was expecting the music to get heavier and actually pick up pace, but each time i was let down, and when the songs end, left feeling unsatisfied. Although i'd personally consider it a waste of time, it is better than wasted money, so if you really want to give Opeth a try, I suggest you download a few songs first (It doesn't matter which, after half an hour they all sound the same). Then again however, some of you may actually enjoy listening to this crap..."
2,Acoutic intervals do not make this art,Put your favorite metal CD and your acoutic quitar CD (if you have one) on the stereo. Then switch between the two every 30 seconds and you have Opeth. The acoustic interrupts the metal (which isn't going anywhere anyway)and vice versa. The glowing reviews here only indicate how naive metal fans are about music.
1,Opeth is not good,"Imagine Limp Bizkit mixed with classical music, it might sound ok if they knew how to play their instuments . Not good, not worth buying, liten to the new album from Cold or Linkin Park, now theres REAL talent ."
4,"Amazing CD, not-so-amazing bonus track.","If you're reading this review, chances are you already know that Morningrise is an amazing album. You probably even own a copy already, and just want to know if it is worth the extra money to have the one bonus track that is on this reissue. The answer, sadly, is no. The bonus track, Eternal Soul Torture, is a basically a poor quality demo recording of a song that ended up being incorporated into another track on this album. It really doesn't add anything to the album. In fact, it almost takes away from the brilliant work that is Morningrise. If I were to review the regular edition of the album I would give it 5 stars easily. Because of the poor quality of the bonus track, and the high price of the reissue, I am rating this edition at 4 stars. I would recommend it only to those people (like me) who are completists and have to own every single Opeth song."
5,rare find,"The following statement is true for all of the Subdudes performances.Rock, country, blues, bluegrass, gospel, and even zydeco all wrapped up in soulful voices, harmonies, skilled musicianship, careful songwriting, integrity, and most of all...love.I have all of their CDs and I've seen them live. If only the music industry showed them the respect that their fans know they deserve."
5,Heaven,"Of all the CD's I own, this one gets by far the most play. In fact I'm on my second copy. It's most definitely deserted island material.There is so much happening on this album on so many levels. Unbelievable percussion! The arrangements are second to none.This album represents what is great about New Orleans music. It is ""Jazzfest"" rolled up on one CD."
5,The Black Stallion/The Black Stallion Returns,"For a number of years, The Black Stallion has always stuck in my mind as one of the most beautifully filmed movies that I could remember. After the ship goes down and the boy and horse wind up on the island, a dance of fear and need occur between the two. A tenuous, and, then, strong bond forms and continues in the ""real"" world. The Black Stallion Returns is a continuation of the first film. While the primary characters are in this second film, it's just my opinion that the first is much better, although, it's nice to know that this love continues over time and distance."
5,Classic Movies,"I originally only wanted The Black Stallion, but seeing these two together for a reasonable price was enough of a motivator to just buy both. They are wonderful, classic movies that I enjoyed as a child and now I enjoy them again with my daughter."
3,Ok writing prompts,"My daughter was super excited when we first gave this to her, but over time has lost interest and said she's already filled out the cool pages.Overall, worth the money, just bummed she won't end up using all the pages"
3,Not one of Christy's best,"This album suffers from weak songs and a weak production; songs like ""missing you"" and ""musha god help her"" pack none of the punch of the live Christy, and are reduced to sounding like wallpaper music. Standout tracks are ""All for the Roses"", a great cover of Ewan MacColl's ""First time ever I saw your face"", and ""Middle of the Island"", a haunting duet with Sinead O'Conner. These are great, the rest is a bit bland."
3,Buy your own screws...,"It's an extension, like the other reviews, not very sturdy but going across a 90' opening I had to use THREE of these. Longer run without support makes it flimsy I knew that going in... no biggie. Nothing short of building a wall is going to be sturdy at that length without support. No surprise there.However the main gate came with screws for the one included extension, but all of these came without screws. I was VERY annoyed with having to go and buy my own screws. Of course they aren't like the ones that come with the main section of gate so I have protruding screws that are a bit of hazard."
2,Cheaply made,"I purchased other metal pet gates before and liked them. In this instance I needed to add an extension. It was cheaply made and the ends don't stay attached to the wall, plus it is difficult to adjust. I would NOT recommend this extension gate."
2,Lots of duplicated info-- buy Professional Chef instead!,"Although there is a lot of great information in the book, about 90-95% of it is straight out of ""The Professional Chef."" For another $20 or so, buy it instead. You get the same knife-handling info, and a ton more.This book should sell for [less]."
3,the garde manger chef,this book was very detailed.only thing i did not like is because it was paper back but other than that it had a lot of information about diffrent knifes.
3,Reader's Digest information at Text Book prices,"The Professional Chef's Knife Kit is a slight volume on knife skills. Nothing advanced. Nothing deep or insightful. Very basic, solid information. Biggest problem with the book is the price. School text books are expensive compared to other books on the subject and this one is no exception. If it were half the price I'd say buy it, read it and learn everything in it in a week or two, then you'll nver have to pick it up again. At the price it is listed for I have a hard time recommending it."
5,"A moving, memorable memoir, balanced, insightful, readable","Ms. Parker's memoir resonates powerfully for African-Americans and other Americans, who may be among the ""firsts"" from their communities to ""tresspass in halls of privilege"". Unlike some similar memoirs, it is not so tragic as to be embittering, but is a balanced presentation of a carefully examined experience. Ms. Parker's love of the written word is evident in her well-chosen descriptive phrases and well-paced story-telling. The book is very readable, and, if you can relate to it at all, once you pick it up, you don't want to put it down. I commend Ms. Parker for her courage and tenacity in telling a very important story, that needs to be told and retold, and understood by Americans of every hue. For blacks, there's insight into our own diversity, and our weakness for hurting each other when in pain. For others, there's valuable insight about what it takes to create a truly inclusive society."
2,Predictable and unenlightening,"This book focuses on the mundane details of a woman who was motivated to advance her self-interest and seemed to care little about helping others less fortunate. The book was unsatisfying because the author seemed one-dimensional and rather ordinary. Not a good role model for African-Americans in my opinion, too concerned about status."
1,Not for 2001's,"OK I understand that everyone makes mistakes. Butdoesn't anyone prrof read these things a little? This book CLEARLY does not cover 2001 Hyundai Elntras, REGARDLESS of what the title says. I'm sure it does a great job of coveing '96-'00 models, but the '01 is a complete redesign and this book has nothing to do with it. What's worse is that Haynes doesn't even put out a book covering the 01's because it thinks this one does..."
2,Hyundau Elantra 1996-2001 (Haynes Manuals),"It is a good primer, but it skips over a few basic issues. I purchased this to find out how to remove the front rotors and it basically says to get a mechanic to do this. I'm not sure if the car design is that bad or the writing of the book is that bad. I had to look through several chapters, some not dealling with brakes, to find this out. I'm glad I bought it used and didn't pay the full price of the book for this information."
3,Not very comprehenisve.,"I have had some haynes manuals in the past, and have been truly amazed at how well they have covered the issues at hand. This book does not do this. It pretty much shows diagrams that do not even correspond to Hyundai Elantras! I was extremely dissapointed. The range they try to cover is too far. In books that span various models, they usually show each model specifically and the differences you will run into. This book does not and makes it extremely vague. If you have no problem using this manual, in all likelihood you probably could have done the job without it. These books are not written for mechanics. They are written for regular people.I do not recommend this book at all."
2,Not for all,I have bought many other repair manuals. This one seems to lack important clues for the non professional mechanics. It also lacks diagrams explaining important basic procedures. For experienced mechanics it is ok.
2,cute,its what i wanted :) but its not my favorite piercing of mine but i have to wear the bioplast cuz i break out with certain metals
5,I have had no problems,"I bought this drive even though another review stated that the software was nothing but a pain. I installed the drive and I am using the software that was already installed for the CD/DVD burner that came with the computer. I did NOT install the software that came with the drive, I just allowed Windows to recognize the drive and install it's own drivers. That, and software I purchased for making cd's and such, and I am a VERY happy camper.The drive has been working fine for over a month. We burn CD's on it. We use it as a source drive when we need to copy one of our homemade DVDs. It is working flawlessly.I recommend this drive if you are comfortable with doing the install yourself. I can offer no opinion on the Sony supplied software, as I simply don't use it."
5,Good value,This CD drive has worked fine for me. I only installed the software programs that I needed. So far I have not had any software problems or conflicts.
4,A Great Drive with Terrible Software,I am running an older OS and decided it would be nice to be able to watch a DVD on my system . I felt confident in the Sony name when I purchased the CRX320A CD RW DVD drive. After installing the NERO software and uninstalling it and then re-installing it about 10 times I gave up .In desperation I found a old copy of LG's Power DVD and used that instead.The drive now works perfectly. My Windows 98se did not recognize the DVD aspect of the drive because the OS only has simple CD ROM drivers in it. So if you are running any OS other than XP you may find yourself having the same problems I had until you find a suitable DVD Player to install.As for the supplied NERO software ....the CD might make a nice drink coaster ! I have no idea what was being thought when Sony included it with this drive because it simply doesn't work .
1,Dead on arrival,This item shipped as advertised however it was inoperable when it arrived. This device would not read CD's or DVD's with the Plug and Play software supplied with Windows XP.
2,"Works, but has lots of issues","This is actually the second Boss stereo that I've bought. The other one was a different model, but it works great in my brother's car. I was excited for the bluetooth and that works great. Calls come in and play good over my car speakers. As for the USB, every time I play something using the usb, it gets a high pitched frequency that is audible whenever it switches tracks, which it seems to do sometimes in the middle of a song. If I use a cd, no high pitched frequency, no random song changes. Also has the problem where if it's left in the sun, the display stops working. Just not a good product. If you think you can deal with these defects, it does play cds fine and the bluetooth works good. But if you want something that just works, look elsewhere."
3,Works ok,"The pedal works fine, but the manual is pretty vague. Would like little more detail, especially for those who are new to the electronic music world"
4,"Worth the Price - A Good Read - Good, Simple Advice","I just got finished with Persuasive Online Copywriting. The style is direct. The information is factual and actionable, although a little repititive. But, they repeat the important points. For such a small book on a big topic, it does a great job of moving forward your skills. I think anyone who needs to write for the web will do well to read it. It does not go over a beginner's head. I've been writing and designing web sites for years, and I found something on almost every page worth highlighting. It's already made an impact on my style. Looking over it again, I have no idea how they could have done more in less space to identify the important topics and address them. If you're in my business, please do not buy this book."
4,Persuaded me to keep reading and wanting to learn more!,"This book scores a triple play! Its three authors unite to create a book that will help anyone turn their writing and Web site into a winner. It is packed full of valuable information that is presented in an easy to read fashion. The authors have a unique writing style that is witty and humorous and keeps you entertained even when explaining about something as boring as online conversions. This book would be great for students in a Web site writing class or for someone who wants to make a Web site that is more user and reader friendly. I personally did know anything about Web writing before reading the book, but it has really inspired me to learn more and improve my skills. I have definitely been persuaded!"
5,Excellent book; informative and well-written,"Lots of great info on what WORKS in copywriting. Very helpful in avoiding the common mistakes that so many make. The authors ""we-we"" calculator is brilliant!"
1,Very underwhelming,"I liked the author's web postings, which is what got me interested enough to buy the book. But I felt the book was honestly a waste of money."
5,a standard in the lit.,"My field is not Native American history and prehistory, but I needed authoritative background information for a magazine article which, among other things, asked questions about a section of the Seneca Trail near my home.A good number of authors treated this storied war road and related subjects. The list of references was big, and since many of the work's chapters still are cited in newer work, getting current in my line of inquiry got a big assist.HNAI,vol.15 is a good place for the non-academic to start searching and a collection of absorbing reads."
1,Very dissapointed!,"I got the item quickly on MOnday, had to wait until the weekend to do the job. There are no instructions in the package on how to use it or put it together. I'm not a first time user but I'm not a professional either and very careful when handling safety issues. It took me 1/2 hour just to figure out how to do this. The Instruction Manual only has general safety rules, troubleshooting and part list. The water bin seems to go lose,I'm not sure I should start the job! I have a friend helping and it might be a waste of our time! More to come!"
3,Too expensive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Nice table but way to EXPENSIVE. LOWER YOUR PRICES OR AT LEAST THROW IN THE TABLE TOP.
4,Thomas The Tank Engine Table,I have reviewed this table several times at the...Store. It does not look like it should cost [$$$] dollars. I would love to be able to buy it for my 3 year old son which is crazy over thomas the tank engine but I just cant see myself spending that much money on this [poorly] made table. I think the company needs to be more considerate for the children. Lower your prices
3,$$$ TRAIN TABLE PRICE IS EXTREMELY TOO HIGH****,"Hello, my son is 3 and just was newly introduced to Thomas, he loves it, there are so many trains to collect from 2004 and past years. This table is so over priced, we decided also to build one $60 for materials (all oak) and a few hours and its done, personally its beautiful and stained it looks like an expensive piece, (thanks to my brother-in-law builder and my husband), if you are not as lucky to have someone in your family build it for you here is a suggestion..get in touch with your local school, or the woodshop teacher and see if you can get one of the students to build it as a project (they get graded for this) and your helping that student learn, or get plans and build it yourself, dont have the saws? your local home store may cut the wood for you. Its just a suggestion because thomas stuff is great but I would rather spend my money on the trains (which is the REAL enjoyment. Hope this helps"
4,"Expensive, but great quality","I was really torn over whether this table justified it's price; especially since it doesn't include the play top, which you have to buy seperately. Despite the price, I do have to say, I'm very happy with the quality of the product.When the table arrived the box was dinged, but thankfully the contents inside were well packed with styrofoam and cardboard protecting each piece.The wood is high quality with easy to connect fastners. Very stable. The train images on the side of the table and on the legs are great. They weren't stickers, but actually some kind of high quality painted image that has a very durable finish on it. Some of the train images even have a full plastic face piece for Thomas and each of his friends.The table is well designed for a toddler's height and the allows them to reach to the center.Needless to say my 2 year old son loves it! He wakes up in the morning, says choo choo and runs out to go play at the table."
4,"nice, but expensive","My twin boys love it, but for the price, the board should be included. What good is the table without the board? I wouldn't even call it a table, it's just a frame. I think it is utterly ridiculous not to include the board with the table. They are both WAY to expensive for a bunch of wood!!"
5,Country blues meets jazz,"Mississippi bluesman Johnnie Temple was a protege of Skip James who never achieved stardom but influenced a number of important blues musicians including Robert Johnson. This CD covers his late recorded output from April of 1940 to 1949. The accompanying personnel in the sessions is impressive -- they include Buster Bailey, Sam Price, ""Red"" Allen, Lil Armstrong and Al Casey. Remarkably, the combination of country blues singing and sophisticated jazz works perfectly. In the last few sessions, Temple successfully transitions into Chicago electric blues with elements of bop, boogie woogie and r and b. Highly recommended."
4,"A Retro Classic, With Some Good Stuff","The authors of the Nancy Drew Cookbook have cleverly and completely captured the essence of the Nancy Drew novels, as they still existed in the early 1970s (I understand Miss Drew has been significantly updated in recent years).Most of the recipes look as if they were designed by a dietitian for a school cafeteria, but there are a few bright spots here and there, as well as many actual good cooking and entertaining tips.I once held an Elvis party and tried to recreate Elvis' favorite foods. This is the type of cookbook I used, one which offered essentially plain, homey food, not at all in accord with today's dietary fashions."
2,Hillbilly Hula,"I was very excited to get this video since the same company made a very enjoyable bellydance series. But this was nothing but a let down. It was difficult to follow the instructor and the music resembled that of a hillbilly ho-down. The moves are presented quickly with no practice move or smooth transition into the next move. With practice it would probably get easier. However, with the annoying music, it's difficult to make it through the video once! The ultimate goal of the video, as defined by the instructor, is to be able to perform the ""sunshine hula"" dance which looks like it should be the official state dance of Arkansas instead of Hawaii. I would skip this video and just buy one of the belly dance ones. They use a lot of the same moves but the belly dance one is easier to follow and has better music."
2,Worst Home Workout I've ever done.,"The format of this workout is very hard to follow. All of the instructions are done via voice over, and therefore some of the cues come after the motion has ever started. Before the hula workout begins, she does the whole thing as an example, but never again demonstrates a move before you do it. It is very hard to follow. It is an easy workout, for those who are just starting a workout routine, but I suggest watching the video a few times before actually doing it, so you can know what to expect."
2,Too Fast !!,I'm a beginner and this dvd is way too fast for me. I doubt I'd ever be able to learn it as she doesn't even explain what she's doing ! Too fast and not enough description !
2,Not Kili's best work!,"I recently bought all of the Island Girl Hula videos (except Basic Hula). I'd have to say out of all of them, this was my least favorite.The main reason being that the music was pretty bad, especially during the final dance. Also, I think Kili does a better job when she has her background dancers...in this one Kili is solo. I believe that this and basic hula are her earliest ones and I don't recommend either of them...try the other ones instead!"
3,Hula Workout for Weight-Loss,Should get the beginners workout first. Adds great variety to the aerobic dance workout.
2,hardcore P C,"This worshipful hymn to the plains Indians should find favor with aficionados of the sub-genre.To everyone else, the effect of this movie is soporific at best. The many times when Farrah begins to take her clothes off keep interest alive.The DVD is atrocious. No tracks, just one long PLAY. The music (which is good) is so loud for the first fifteen minutes that it is hard to understand the words of the narrative, and the music never lets up. The narrative voice-over the ""scenes from the life of"" make for a distanced experience.The fine cast is wasted, but they lend an air of quality to this lame excuse for a movie."
4,Thomas's Buddy,Trevor was a hit with my grandson as an addition to his Thomas and Wooden Railway system. Trev joined the engine club without a hitch and his little green presence seems much appreciated by both the kids and other engines in the system.
4,Album style is dated but it is a classic,"I enjoyed hearing Kentons' aggressive arrangements of Bali Hai, I Love Paris, and others again after many years. Truly a classic, although somewhat commercially compromised CD. I am a high school band director, and my students are playing these two Kenton charts this year (along with several others) - it is really very nice that the original recordings are still avaiable."
3,did like glamourous life,cool c was a okay artist in 89 but when the checks stopped coming in he and steady b went and robbed a bank and cool killed a lady officer now both of them are in jail for life b got liofe and c's on deathrow.
4,Born on the 4th,My wife is a collector of everything Tom Cruise. This is not one of her favorites but I think it is a typical Oliver Stone Hit from the 90's. Good watch.
3,Apparently I'm the minority - I didn't like it.,"To say that Cruise and Stone are seasoned is an understatement, so I expected this to be a classic that I had been missing for the last 15 years. Well, not really.This film was really exhausting for me. I thought it was too long, and I started to lose interest about 90 minutes in. It actually took two sittings for me to be able to finish it. The performance that Cruise offers is outstanding, but the not-so-subtle political narrative really struck me as routine and very predictable for Hollywood.The film skips a large portion toward the end in which Cruise emerges as a notable public speaker, but it isn't explained how or why. The film concludes, framing his story as a triumph of character not too dissimilar from Forrest Gump. I wish I had enjoyed it more.Top Gun and The Color of Money remain my choice Cruise films from the 80's."
3,Cruise's Best Performance,"For those of us who always believed that Tom Cruise was only capable of action pictures and couch jumping, this movie was certainly an eye-opener. So, three stars for this film, based Tommy's surprisingly strong acting.As for the rest of the film.... Meh. The story is the typical unsubtle Oliver Stone narrative. He crams his usual leftist ""perspective"" down your throat soo far it's hard not to gag."
1,Not as bad as Saving Private Ryan,I saw this movie in the theater and I fell asleep through the whole movie. Saving Private Ryan is my least favorite movie. This movie was terrible and I don't want to say this but Tom Cruise had bad acting in the movie and I have to give this movie one star because it was one of the worst war movies I have ever seen. If I were you don't even rent or buy this movie it's terrible.
4,Platoon is better.,"Tom's performance is the best thing in this movie, the score is good, the cinematography is good, its pretty powerful and has some shocking things in it, it also explains alot about the truth of vietnam, everything else is good but not great. There is some smut that could have been taken out, it also ends to abruptly and i would like to know what happened to him, did he die, or live happily or well as happily as he could ever after, what happened? Besides those 2 flaws its pretty good, but platoon is better. Toms best performance is in The Last Samurai which is also a better film. I hope Alexander proves to be Stone's best which i think it will be. 7 out of a 10 for this movie."
2,Born on the fourth of July,"If you want good war scenes watch Saving Private Ryan, if you want a typical ""I went to war so feel sorry for me"" plot, watch this movie."
3,Amazing Performance by Tom Cruise,"I avoided this movie until now, because I do not need to relive the Vietnam War and its associated tragedies. But, I had always heard how good Tom Cruise was in this role, and now I know it is true. His performance is truly amazing. In the Special Features the man, whose real life the movie is based on, said a few times he would see Tom with the long hair and in the wheelchair, and think he was looking at some time-travel mirror of his younger life.I hated this movie, because it brought back sad memories, but Tom Cruise's performance and the movie should be seen by everyone at least one time. It shows how deep a person can sink, and still learn to swim in a new way and revive his life and become successful with it.It's a hard movie to watch, but see it anyway, because it is a story worth your time."
4,Good Treatment of the 60's,"Based on the true story of Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise), a gung-ho marine who questions his patriotism after some serious war wounds. Stone's surreal treatment of Kovic will make you empathize with the main character, but too many gaps in his Vietnam-era odyssey keeps the film from being a masterpiece. Still, a fine production in keeping with Stone's signature style."
3,Not quite sure about this one.,"I finally watched this after hearing my mom hype it for years. I have always understood it to be a war movie - but it isn't, not in the traditional sense of the word. There are about 10 minutes of war footage in this movie. The rest is (prior) about Ron's growing up loving to fight and being patriotic, and (after) Ron's adjustment to life and redefining patriotism.There is one problem with the DVD - the case says it's 1 hour and 25 minutes long. I have been watching for 2 hours and there's no end in sight. I'll save the end of it for another day, but beware if you think it's a quick watch."
1,Flawed,"No matter how good a movie may be as a production, it must be evaluated on its historical accuarcy in cases like this. Stone purports to be making a true story. The violent confrontation at the Republican Convention depicted in this flick did NOT occur. It occurred at the Democratic Convention. Oliver Stone is a member of the Hollywood clique that is attempting to rewrite history. All of Stone's propaganda cannnot change the facts that the Democrat Party started the Vietnam War (under Truman) and that the Democrat Party was responsible for the major opposition to Civil Rights legislation in the 60's. Sorry, Stone. You are a Stalinist. This movie is just pure commie-prop. Had Stone promoted this movie as fiction then it would be good entertainment. His attempt to call it 'historical' reduces it to mere propaganda. Stone is the Josef Goebbels of Hollywood."
1,Typical Oliver Stone fantasy and propaganda,"While Tom Cruise does an excellent job, given such a poor script, Oliver Stone's liberal fantasies ruin this movie. The facts are historically inaccurate, rearranged to fit Mr. Stone's version of reality."
3,Ova...Done,"I was warned by several opinionated reliable music collectors not to buy this c.d. I did. Do I regret it ? Partially. The fault or miss of this c.d does not lie in the lyrics or song writing (references to Reagan, Bush,Margaret Thatcher, and Janet Jackson may sound out-dated,though). It begins with the sound or style of the first two opening tracks (which may turn out to be the best tracks as a whole). Ghetto Heaven and Twisted are air-brushed with the Minneapolis sound popularized in the 80's by Prince and his family. The instrumental Ovasaxed is lush but not memorable; It could be used as a theme for a late midnight light jazz hour on any radio station.As for the other tracks the only saving grace is the presence of Sandra St. Victor's vocals. Is this a pass or fail c.d. Let's just say it neither easily passes or painfully fails."
3,Chain is a slow starter,"The tracks from ""Chain"" are indigative of the times when certain black groups were trying to break out of the R&B mold (i.e. Living Colour). I bought the album for ""Ghetto Heaven"" although the single had a better variation of the song. ""Sweet Liberation"", ""Ghetto Heaven"", and ""Little Black, Little White Lies"" are the best of the eleven. I would characterize the music of this album as more R&B-Rock than Funk. Certain songs are over-produced which makes some of it sound monotonous, even with Sandra St. Victor's strong voice. ""Moon in Scorpio"" (their next album) is slightly better. However, their latest album ""Connected"" is by far superior than the collection of the other two. It unfortunately is receiving the same ""one hit wonder"" airplay as the previous albums. Lyrically though, the social consciousness remains the same throughout all three albums. Buy this album ""Chain"" if you are a collector, not necessarily if you want vintage tunes to listen to."
2,"Buy Moon In Scorpio& Connected, pass on this one",unless you're a 'black rock historian'. On this disc they sound like they weren't sure what direction they wanted to go in.
2,Going out of style!,"I purchased this album back in 1992 only because I was familiar with their work on Paula Abdul's Spellbound album. However, their Chain album is not all what it's cracked up to be. Even in 1992, I thought the music was going out of style, as there are too much bass, too much horn and screaming. I think the songs would have sounded better if they harmonized better instead of focusing on the overrated pop."
3,iCat is Fun But Doesn't Do Much,"My son played with this for a few days after receiving it and then forgot about it. It's a cute toy, but doesn't do much."
1,Waste of time and money,I had severe agoraphobia and panic disorder. I ordered the videos and I can honestly say they were worthless and a waste of money. I had also ordered Dr Claire Weekes books and tapes and they were the best thing that happened to me. Do not waste your money on any of Lucinda Bassett's materials.Former Agoraphobic
5,Great looking firepit,"Read all the reviews before purchasing this great looking grill & sure enough experienced some rusting of the inner pan & grill. So as advised by other buyers I just painted it with high heat paint purchased at the local Home Depot and it looked great again. I love the granite inserts. The colors match my burgandy & grey deck beautifully. Although it's brown, it matches & even looks greyish. LOVE IT! We have it off the deck on the adjacent patio because we don't want to chance heat, flames & trex, too much invested. LOL!"
5,Housewarming Gift,Bought this as a housewarming gift for my brother. He and his wife absolutely love it. I can't wait to visit and roast some marshmallows with them.
3,"OK, But Nothing Special","Got this to replace an old Casio analog/digital watch that I really liked except that the digital functions (mainly the date) were too dark and small to read easily. This one looked like it had bigger numbers. It does, so the digital part is better. However, the rest is worse.Pros:- Day/Date/Stop Watch functions are big enough to see- Glow in the dark hands don't require you to press the light at night- Resin band doesn't absorb any water; so you can wipe it off and it's not soggy for hoursCons:- ""Skeleton"" hands hard to see against the black face at a glance (my last watch had a white face - much better)- Watch way too thick - I work with my hands and like something thinner so it doesn't get caught in things as easily- When you do want to use the light, it's pretty lameOverall an OK watch, but there are better options out there"
4,Just what I wanted,"Very happy with this particular model New CASIO 100Meter Data Bank Mens Analog/Digital Watch. Was expecting something slightly thinner in profile, but the watch's other charms make up for this nit-pick. I enjoy the bold look, although I find the appearance more masculine than absolutely necessary. If anyone cares, the resin band is quite robust and fairly stiff to start with. In short; a good looker. Telememo feature, worldtime and alarm features all appreciated. A good value from Amazon. The partner vendor took advantage of the relationship by charging $10+ bucks for shipping, which is absurd."
4,Good,works well for your upper body all the way to right on top of your knees. Right under that will get soaked by the water sliding on jacket. thinking of purchasing a pair of nylon pants.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!,"This floating light does not illuminate much area in a pool. Perhaps in a small pool it does better. After trying it, I was ready to toss it - but instead gave it to my son for his room."
2,Not as good as advertised,"This product might be OK for very small ""portable"" pools or maybe a jacuzzi when it's dark, but in a large pool or inground pool forget it. The light doesn't hit the bottom in anything greater than three feet deep (and yes the water is clear). Just looks like a floating lantern.Pool filters tend to have these devices ""congregating"" in one area of the pool, so tethering them somewhere would be more adviseable.I will say (as someone else mentioned) these devices worked much better indoors in a kid's room at night. They had much more fun with it there.Have tried these over the course of many nights during the summer months to try and make it work. Just not what I envisioned."
1,Terrible... do not purchase,"I just received this is in the mail and I couldn't believe how bad this thing is. I shouldn't mention using this in pools because it does not work. It could work in a hot tub but that's about it. I bought it because I have a much bigger one I had found in a local pool supply store. Thinking they were the same brand, I went and ordered this one. It's tiny!!! It was almost humorous when I put next to the other one I have. Do not buy this product."
2,cool light but it leaks,We used it in our hottub for about 5 mins and it acted funny.. first it died and then when I put the batteries back in (in a dry serounding) it wouldnt shut off and only in one setting... Then after 24hrs it dried out and worked fine again. Then I figured out that the little seal around the on of button wasn't all the way connected...I'll fix it but this is always happening to something that is made in China... very cheaply made
5,The Most Relaxing,"This 30 minute practice is just about the best restorative yoga DVD you can imagine. It's set in Maui, so the scenery is lovely, and the entire practice is done seated, for those stressful days when you don't have the energy for much of anything. She does use a lot of ""new age"" terminology, so it that bothers you, look elsewhere. If not, this DVD will surely become one of your favorites for relaxing.As Rainbeau says, ""Yoga is not a competition."" Even though she is very advanced, as you can see when she demonstrates her own practice through the closing credits, she makes Pure Tranquility accessible to all fitness levels. A bonus 15-minute meditation session is also included."
3,good for beginners only,"Setting and instructor are great, and video has a soothing feeling. But, almost all postures are done from a seated position. Even just for relaxation, I like to move around more and get more of a stretch (and I'm a lazy yogini!)."
5,Just what I needed,"At first I was not sure this would work for my application, so I thought for the price I would take a chance and see. The problem was that I needed one of these so I could use the plugs as in a multimeter situation with my scopes BNC connector. I found if you remove the binding post screws, the multimeter leads fit perfect. The only problem was the posts are not marked once you remove the screws.I found the correct connections and marked it with red tape. Works fine. Would buy another one."
3,Decent performance but short on fire,"Despite its obvious originality I have never really been convinced that Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique is the masterpiece it is often claimed to be, and to be honest the Gran Canaria Philharmonic Orchestra's somewhat under-powered performance under Adrian Leaper does little to persuade me otherwise. It's not that the performance is bad, but the orchestra lacks the tonal finesse of its more famous rivals; the fire and brimstone is missing and for the most part the atmosphere is slightly dulled. It does score on subtlety, and the performance is finely paced paying attention to the textural nuances (although the orchestra doesn't always respond with the refined playing needed for the approach). Still, as a superbargain version this shouldn't be immediately dismissed out of hand, and the sound quality is very fine. A cautious welcome, then."
5,Best Real Estate Book on the market,"I have many books on real estate. This is the one that moves from abstract ideas which may be excellent to very frank and clear explanation of how to approach real estate, what to look for, how to find worthwhile investments, how to buy them, and on and on and on. It is a great book."
2,"Does not seem to clean much, a bit sticky","I bought this to clean my long-hair dog's mouth after he eats or his paws after he comes in from a walk, and it was pretty much useless for it. While it is waterless, you do soak the dog's hair with this stuff until it's damp. You then have to comb it and let it dry just like you would with water. I found it did not help get debris/food out at all and left a slight sticky residue. A wet washcloth worked far better for my dog, unfortunately.If you have a short-haired dog, perhaps it would work better."

4,A great all around bicycle book,"Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book is a great book. Ballantine starts off the book with the basic reasons why bicycles are the best form of transportation and it's effect on human society. This may turn off some people as he is very passionate about saving resources. If you are anti-green, you would probably do well to skip the beginning. Be that as it may, it is a very good introduction on bicycles. The book covers the dawn of the invention of the bicycle and the various early forms of the bike. The rest of the chapters delve into the different bike configurations, the components of the bicycles, how to ride and fit your bike to your particular body size, a great review of the futuristic bikes coming our way, servicing your bike and various odds and ends. Richard Ballantine writes in a vivid and entertaining manner and draws from personal experiences to keep the book fresh. This book gets 4 and 1/2 stars. Very good information about bikes."
1,Not that interesting,This is kind of a history of the bicycle. It was not all that useful or valuable a text. I am mainly interested in road bike riding. If you are interested in a historical review of bicycles then you might find part of it of interest.
3,Disappointing,"This CD contains Mussorgsky's Pictures in both the original version for solo piano and Ravel's orchestration. The orchestral performance, though not inspired, is pretty decent. The piano performance, unfortunately, is a disappointment. Sevidov rushes some passages, drags others, and generally seems unsure of his rhythm. For instance, he seems to have added a couple of beats at the end of the ""Chicks in Their Shells"" (or is this just faulty editing?). If you want good performances of both versions, you might have to buy two different CD's."
2,Chuncky,Good watch easy to read. The temp function is useless and your body heat makes the real air temp higher. It is also a big watch and heavy too.
3,inconforme,no muy contento con el porque no describian el tama√±o y yo pense que era como 40 o 41 y resulta que es como 38. ademas de la temperatura las demas funciones son pura paja. no lo recomiendo
2,Good for 3 months?,"I like the watch at first. Temp. feature is miss leading and is only accurate if you remove the watch. Your own body heat effects the temperature reading (dah).However, after 3 month the watch died. It felt like I was just renting the watch."
2,Large size watchband.,Never had a chance to use this watch. The band ran quite large for my smaller wrist.
4,Good solid watch for the money,The watch feels good on the wrist and displays fairly well. Some of the digital is small and hard to read. Setting up the watch was a little more difficult than I expected and you will have to refer to the internet when doing so.
3,Nice Watch,"The watch is OK, need to figure out the appropriate settings. Temperature seems to be inaccurate by about 10 degrees. I favor the metal band which i like very much."
3,Nice looking watch,"This is a nice looking watch. The band is solid and easy to adjust the size. I had to take out 2 segments. I really didn't need some of the functions like tide and moon phases. I like the rest of the features though. Now the bad. The thermometer. If you don't wear the watch it works fine. Put it on and you don't know what the temp is. I guess I really didn't think it would work but a guy can hope, right? all in all it's still a pretty good watch."
5,Great watch,"I purchased this watch about 8-9 years ago. I liked it so much that when the case broke(conection between band and watch}and could not be repaired I purchased another. I am an avid fisherman and like being able to tell the tides. Also, I am very hard on watches and this one can take a beating. You can polishes out scratches on the face"
4,i like,Not a bad watch for the price. Feels very lite on the wrist. I wish the light would stay on longer.
3,great features but hard to set up-analog not coordinated,"it has all the features I wanted , but it has been very difficult to set them all up . i still haven't got them all set up . the main problem is that the analog hands are running slow and did not coordinate with the digital timer as stated in the instructions . however Amazon has graciously agreed to send a replacement , which I hope will overcome that problem . I really appreciate the way Amazon has handled this problem ."
1,I wish I could buy another one of these watches???,"A great watch but Casio does this thing where the watch band pin goes into the watch is cheap plastic; after awhile the pin just wears out the pin hole and the watch is unusable because you cant put a pin in it to hold the watch band. A big rip off. I have had 5 or more expensive Casio watches become unusable because there isn't away to put the watch band on? I am sure that as people wake up to this, there will be a class action lawsuit against Casio for premeditatedly having watches to break after awhile. I wish I could buy a Casio watch, I wont give any more money to those con artist's. A greedy shame of them. What used to be a trustworthy brand is now just a rip off scam."
2,Loved it until the band broke.,"The watch seemed great and I loved it, but sadly it didn't make it even a year. The band broke at the base of the watch where it connects to the watch itself. The underside of the watch is plastic and broke without capability of repair. Broke at night while I was asleep, thus not the good of quality. Would be a great watch if the plastic was a metal."
5,Great buy,"For the price you can't get a better watch. The temperture is acurate, you just have to calibrate it to display the correct info on your wrist."
3,"Nice features, crappy plastic surround.","I've had this watch for about two and a half years and the pin that connects the band to the watch is in a plastic hole (even though the entire rest of the watch is metal). The plastic broke. I had our local watch shop re-drill the hole deeper and the plastic broke again about a month later. There is not enough plastic now to hold the pin. The watch is useless.I did enjoy the features although the thermometer is not very accurate. The lens is a little soft and is easily scratched, however our watch shop will buff it out for free. It buffs out nicely."
1,Non-warranted plastic case,"I got this watch for Father's Day, and about three weeks later, the tab on the case that holds the pin for the watchband, broke. It was then I noticed that the case was plastic with a sliver-like coating. I sent it back to Casio, (repair IDESS337539), expecting a repair under warranty, and was told that Casio does not warrant their cases.(Unbelieveable to me.) I read my guarantee that came with the watch and that's what it states! Casio's price to fix their cheap plastic case? $29.95, almost the price of a new watch, and I would STILL be the owner of a new watch with a cheap, non-warranted, plastic case. No thanks, Casio. I plan to tell the world exactly why I'll never buy one of your products again, and if you're reading this, I hope you don't either.Deane E. Kogelschatz"
4,Good everyday watch,"I got this watch as a gift a couple of years ago, and it is my everyday watch. Mine is a slightly different model, with a negative display.What I like: It looks good, isn't too flashy, and the dual timezone functionality is perfect for my job (I work with a lot of people overseas). I also like the temperature reading, and the timer is really convenient. Inexpensive for all the features it has.What I don't like: The mineral crystal has become scratched over time, but it is still usable. I can't expect sapphire crystal at this price point, but this is obviously the weakest point of the watch. Also, to get an accurate temperature reading, you have to take the watch of your wrist for about 15 minutes - but that happens even with the expensive Suunto or Pro Trek watches, so I can't really hold it against the watch.Overall, I can say I really like this watch. I have a couple of ""nice"" watches I use for going out and dressing up, but this is a perfect watch to wear everyday."
2,Smells weird,The Cashew arrived with a weird smell when eating them. I think they might be bad... It's more safe to purchase from local food markets.
3,Inconvenient height,"Useful safety product, but the lowest setting is inconveniently high for use with a standard height toilet. Hard on the shoulders to use it. Arms were also too coarsely grained for comfort to hands."
1,Buy Something else,Both legs wobble and don't feel very secure when using the handle. I bought a Carex toilet rail at walmart for $35 and feels more secure and has padding on the rail which is nice.
3,Ok for the Money,"Purchased this item for my elderly mother who has very limited mobility. While it is worth the price, the safety rails are pretty flimsy. She can't put her weight on them safely."
2,Not as secure as I wanted it to be.,"Easy to fit on the toilet, but it wiggles and there is no way to secure it. I wouldn't advise using this if you need to put full weight on it or if the person using it is incapacitated."
3,OK if it fits!,"I returned this item because the specs on the site did not match the item. The specs state arms are min 24in off the floor. In fact the min on the item turns out to be 27.5in, way too high for the short stature person the item was purchased for. The specs on the site also state a 10in range of adjustability. In fact the range is just under 5 inches. If it fit the person I think it would work fine. I do not think this was Amazon's fault. I looked on the manufacturer's site and they had the same specs. I called the manufacturer and they were surprised to learn the item did not match their published specs."
3,Higher than described... too high for me,"The description says the height range is 24"" - 29"". In fact, it's 28"" - 32"". That makes the rails uncomfortably high for me, even at the minimum 28"" setting. I am not short: about 5'10""; but it's hard to get any leverage from these rails when trying to stand up.Carex makes a set of rails that are 2 inches shorter than these, and work well for me. Should have gotten those instead of these.Another reviewer warned about the error in the product description, but it didn't register, unfortunately.Another difference between these and the Carex rails is the handgrip material: Medline uses hard plastic, while Carex uses firm foam rubber. The rubber is a lot more comfortable on the hands, but the plastic probably is easier to keep clean.Both brands are very well made, very solid. Actually, except for the height and handgrips, they're virtually identical, as though they came off the same production line.If I can find shorter rails, I'll return the Medline product."
2,Medline toilet safety rail,"While this item works, it is not very steady. It needs a support rail in the front also to prevent it from waving back and forth.I would not want to depend upon this for a very elderly or unsteady person."
3,Not as Sturdy as Expected,"Although it seems to work ok so far - it wobbles considerably and our parent if a little 'wary' of it. I don't think it can fall over, but, it definitely wobbles. I think if I were to purchase another one - I would look for something with four legs. It arrived promptly and was easy to install - but, it definitely wiggles and since our parent is heavy - it makes her nervous. She makes sure she hangs onto her regular grab bar when getting up."
1,Not recommeded,"Unit is flimsy and poorly constructed. Handles wobble badly and give unstable support, especially for any persons that have limited strength and stability. If someone slips and falls hard against the unit, it is unlikely to support there weight and stop them. Unit is only attached by the existing toilet seat bolts, which are not designed to support this type of stucture. On the good side Amazon was accommodating when I returned the product."
4,olmstr,"This is my first Medline product. It arrived earlier than expected, was very easy to install an is doing the job for me daily.I will be removing it shortly, but will be reinstalling it later for another knee surgery. That should tell you how easy it is to install."
3,Handicapped item,"The safety rail is more sanitary than a commode,and takes up less space.However,it is not completely steady ,and,I feel, not safe for the patient to use alone."
3,toilet bars,This bar is easy to install and works for my purpose. I would not suggest this product if using it for a larger person.
3,Unstable,Rails are too high and can't be lowered plus they are unstable - wobble from side to side. Easy to put together.
5,Great product!,"I had to purchase this item before they would let me come home from the hospital, as I just had lumbar back surgery. I have to say my husband was very impressed with the ordering, delivery and the item itself, was very easy to install and is well worth the money. We will keep this for you never know when you may need this again. Great company, great service, great product !"
3,"Nice item, but seems a little jittery?!?!","I installed this according to manufacturer recommendations and my mother likes it, but the legs seem jittery, like they can slide a little. This may frighten her if she's using the toilet in the middle of the night. I have to put some kind of rubber reinforcement on the bottom of the foot so it doesn't slide as much (there is shiny linoleum in my mother's apartment and I can't put a bath rug underneath because she uses a walker and will trip). I was pleased with the price and the ease of install, just a little freaked out by the slight wobble."
3,One size DOES NOT fit all.,"This will work fine on many standard toilets with a rectangular tank. Mine happens to be on the fancy side with a curved tank, so it would not fit between the tank and seat. I had to cut the bracket holes off and mount the back frame BEHIND the tank. No, it is not as steady, not nearly! It will work (if careful) but certainly not as safely, If you have space between seat mounts and tank it will work fine, but you will need ample room to make it work as intended. They don't really show the mounting plate, it's about 9X4 inches. Make sure you have that 4 inches. You need about 2 inches from the bolts to the back of the tank.I guess, buy standard boring stuff for your bathroom. Don't think of design, it may not work."
3,heavyhamd not availale,"While this book is interesting, I defy you to find sets of heavyhands to use, I have used for years, and am trying to find more, and find that most sites that show them, are old sites, and have none, so if you buy you may need to emprevise, if you do not already have Havyhands yourself."
3,A bit outdated,"Some aspects of this book are helpful. For example, the information about what to expect developmentally from the six year old. But some aspects are dated. Also, the authors suggest to ignore a bit more than I am comfortable with in terms of bad behavior."
2,terrible six's,"I was so excited to find this book. From the reviews online I thought this was perfect, but when i started reading it I realized how outdated the book is. It was deffinetly written for a different generation of parents and children."
3,Helpful but outdated,"The number of references to nose drops was kind of comical. The number of references to the mom staying home and the dad trying to make a man of his boy was less comical. Overall, I found the information very helpful, but I felt like I was getting advice from my grandma or something. Reading this in conjunction with ""The Brat Stops Here"" have helped me feel much better about the way my 6-year-old behaves. I don't know if I'll buy the book about Sevens."
3,Helpful but needs updating,"This is a helpful - if a bit outdated - summary of what one can expect from a ""typical"" six-year-old. The author repeats numerous times that each child is an individual and therefore what is considered ""normal"" is actually an average of a certain number of children of the same age and cannot be held as a standard that each child must meet or somehow be found wanting.The biggest help to me, personally, was the description of how many six-year-olds experience mercur...more This is a helpful - if a bit outdated - summary of what one can expect from a ""typical"" six-year-old. The author repeats numerous times that each child is an individual and therefore what is considered ""normal"" is actually an average of a certain number of children of the same age and cannot be held as a standard that each child must meet or somehow be found wanting."
2,Very repetitive. Did not care for at all.,"I personally found this book terrible. While it did accurately describe my six year old, the amount of information that was helpful could have fit on three pages. The book reads as though it were written by high school student trying to come up with enough words for their essay."
4,a bit dated,but my daughter in law actually got a lot out of it and found it helpful in understanding her new son.
4,The Series Is Good,"When my then 5 1/2 year old was behaving much differently than he had at age 5, and I thought I must have lost all of my parenting skills, my mother pulled out an old hardcover version of the Gesell Institute Books and - oh my! - much of the changes seemed to be quite common among 5 1/2 year olds!These are 'old' books (I'm one of the earliest of the baby boomers, though my child is now nearly 9), but they are still useful.This book and all in the series are little paperbacks, quick to read. Our society has changed since they were written, so a bit of the book may seem dated if you don't like 'traditional roles. However, there is much good information and wisdom in here, unencumbered by the modern day concerns about ADD and such. In expensive, a good investment to ease a parent's mind. A nice gift from grandparents to their own children, and for young parents, just nice to have on the shelf for those days when we forget that kids behaviors and interests change as they grow up."
1,Waste of Time!,"I was never a professional dancer, but always loved to dance. I guess that's at least one reason why I love to watch dancers perform almost any type of dance. That's certainly why I tend to buy so many moves sight unseen if they even suggest that I'll see lots of dancing.What can I say? I was expecting a lot from Lambada, but the movie let me down in a big way. In my humble opinion, the movie is more about smut that strut with not nearly enough dancing. The movie was extremely boring with a very weak plot. I can usually take that if the dancing is strong and the music is grand. This movie lacked both. Truly disappointing."
4,HOTT !!!! Lambada,"Hi! If you're into all sorts of dance and music videos, then you'll definately want to buy or rent this movie. I love the Lambada dance and the ethnic background it has so I LOVE the movie. The other Lambada movie is my favorite though. It has to do with a Brazilian girl making money dancing the Lambada in a club. GO WATCH the movie. it's a definate watch!!!! You wont regret."
1,"Attention - it's not the original ""Lambada"" !","I was looking for a ""Lambada"", a bright Brazilian movie,with the catching Brazilian flavor and dancing.Instead... they sell a castrated American ""adaptation""even without a famous theme song!Friends,Don't buy it. Waste of time."
2,Cheesy movie.,I bought this movie to add to my Dance movie collection. Movie really has nothing to do with the Lambada dance. Very disappointing.
3,Disappointed,"When I took it out of the box it stuck to the container and cracked. So unfortunately, I never got to see it."
4,I can dance,"The Movie L is looking for is The Forbidden Dance......... I enjoyed, both those movies as well as Salsa. This movie is a little cheesey but when you are ten and watching it, who cares!!!!"
4,Gem of a book,"This is a gem of a book. It has a well orchestrated storyline-- the author's writing flows smoothly - there wasn't a lot of flowery, descriptive narrative to drag the story down. I thought that the author brought the story together quite simply -- the characters were all likeable.There are four funny, eccentric elderly women that add hilarity and substance to the story. The hero is delish and the heroine is a strong, intelligent, kind character.This book was worthy of my time to read and was my first C. Maxwell book--I will read more of her books having read this one."
4,Great all round entertainment,"Smart script, great cast, set in Venice....what more could you want? Rex Harrison is wonderful as the center piece in this film. Like a brilliant jewel he is surrounded by a worthy group of fine actors--Capucine, Edie Adams, Susan Hayward and Cliff Robertson. This is an old-fashioned, totally entertaining film. It won't keep you awake pondering it's meaning but it's good fun and totally worth watching just for Harrison's presence."
1,SORRY EXCUSE FOR A CASINO GAME,"The graphics are ok, if you like early 1990s graphics. The realism of ""casino gaming"" is just not there. THe card games produce hands that are too unrealistic to sit through. Save your money."
5,911 Tragedy,"More information on the 911 Tragedy, especially Flight 93.May we never forget the people killed on that day!"
4,An Adventure in History,"I used this book as a seventh grade Texas history teacher and found that my students were very engaged in this story of a German family caught up in the turmoil of the Civil War. The story of Luisa von Scholl, a 16-year-old who disguises herself as a hospital orderly to rescue her brother, is compelling. It's interesting for both girls and boys. Highly recommended!"
4,Supplies Fuel,This cannister works well and burns clean but is a little pricey. Lasts a good amount of time with an efficient stove and cookware.
5,Deal With The Dead,"Les Standiford's sixth John Deal novel is a humdinger. All the suspense, all the action, and all the humanity that we've come to expect of Standiford's ""Deal"" Novels is there. The story is one of redemption. John Deal redeeming his knowlege of his father who had apparently been a crooked builder and a suicide; redeeming his family's good name; and, finally, redeeming himself. Can he do it? You bet. But, not without all kinds of barriers and impediments to climb over or push out of the way. Standiford is the worthy sucessor to John D. MacDonald and his Florida based Travis McGee stories. But, Standiford's John Deal is more a real person than MacDonalds McGee. Read DEAL WITH THE DEAD. It's the real deal."
3,Avg At Best-Typical Standiford,"a generic thriller featuring a Miami contractor that's too dumb to be believable(how can you empathize with an idiot?) and dialogue that sounds like a 1950s teen prom; two major negatives that ruin a decent plot but is typical of the series; one would expect better of Standiford who is, or recently has been, a professor of creative writing in a southern university"
4,"Excellent Gina bio, but doesn't cover her life in the 1990's","I read this book several years ago via interlibrary loan, and it's quite good as a biography of Lollobrigida, although unofficial/unauthorized; however, it's somewhat out of date now, having been published in 1990, so it doesn't cover her most recent movie work nor her latest artistic efforts or forays into political and social activism. Also, the author is a non-native English speaker (Brazilian native living in Tokyo, I believe); I think the book was in fact translated into English from Portuguese, so the turn of phrasing is occasionally odd to the American eye. All the same, there is very little in full-length book form on Gina available to U.S. readers, so if you're a fan and you get a chance to get ahold of this book, absolutely do get it."
4,Very Attractive,"Lady is the beautiful magenta engine with gold trimming who holds the key to the secret of the Magic Railroad. If you've seen the movie Thomas and The Magic Railroad featuring Peter Fonda and Alec Baldwin, you'll be familiar with this charming Lady.Lady is a straightforward engine (meaning, she doesn't have any moveable parts), but she is attractive. Although my son asked for her, he doesn't take her out much for some reason! (He has dozens of the trains for the wooden tracks--and even has a die cast Lady. He *did* play the diecast version to death, though, wearing off her paint job!)If your little one loves the Thomas movie and seems enthralled by Lady, it will likely be a welcome addition to the collection. You may want to pick up Diesel with Pinchy, though, so your child can replay the scene in the movie!"
1,Not what I expected - dimensions given are all wrong,"I purchased this for my granddaughter as a gift. I'm not familiar with this line of toys and I was very disappointed when I saw this toy. The description gives the dimensions as 2.1 x 5.0 x 5.0 inches. This little train engine is actually about 2.5 inches long, 2.0 inches tall and 1.25 inches wide. I would not have paid $11 for this if I had known."
2,Not one of his favorites....,"Poor lady, in our house, sits relegated to the corner of the play room. For some reason, this is not one of my son's favorite engines...he has so many to pick from, and she never gets chosen to haul the other coaches...."
1,Sentai Filmworks....you ruined this anime.,"Ok first of all let me say this, I really do love this anime, and it's up there on my list of ""Top Fave's"". But the way they packaged this is just...EW. They stack 4 dvd's on top of each other. That's ridiculous. Angel beats had a slot for EACH dvd, but they couldn't do that for this anime or say, Clannad. Again the anime is very good, and is really funny with some romance, which is why I like it so much. So anime=awesome, packaging=PLEASE CHANGE."
2,Unimpressed,"I found this title to be very simplistic in terms of the plot and the depth of the characters. The individual episodes were not interesting and there was no overall story line pulling together all the episodes. I ended up not even being able to watch more than about 4 episodes.I am an adult who likes Japanese high school anime as I spent some time in Japan. Also for me high school anime is relaxing as for most of us high school was much more simple and innocent than adult life.For me the gold standards in high school anime are GTO, School Rumble, and His and Her Circumstances. These all show some plot sophistication and are extremely well written. I was disappointed that Special A was not anywhere close to these titles."
5,A surprising little gem,"I was familiar with some of this music prior to listening to this album [and really hope Arte Nova and the Harvestehude choir do another disk of the Brahms ""Marienlieder""]and had something to which I could compare this performance. Harvestehude impressed me so much that I've started looking for other disks of their performances. Really well-done subtle renditions of these gorgeous under-exposed Brahms gems. If you have any affinity at all for German choral music, you'll love this collection."
3,Not Bad,"While this is a good book for beginners, I've read better (orat least more interesting). The guide is relatively complete andcomprehensive. I just happen to be partial to Crysal Health Secrets and Crystal Love Secrets (wish they'd reprint it) by Brett Bravo."
3,a different slant,"This book introduces a few new topics to working with crystals, such as generating energy from entire faces, or from the edges where the faces of the c-axis meet along the body of the crystal, instead of it's termination.A basic guide, and very easy to understand, this book is reccomended for the beginner."
2,Physician's review,"From the professional credits of the author I expected great things. I was impressed by the topics which were listed. However, I found the book greatly disappointing for the following reasons:1. The references, when checked, very often failed to contain the material cited2. The statistical charts were often redrawn and were inaccurate3. The serious questions about mortality figures with amputations were not explained when the presented data suggested that the premise that surgery was better was not supported by the facts4. The referencecing to the major reference:The Medical and Surgical HIstory of the Civil War , was inaccurate in many instances."
4,Evading and Inviting,"Classic Bob in its most simplistic form. Acoustic and Celtic, this album is a true gem. Bob seems to have a polished sense of rawness. He has taken folk and pop and combined them in wonderous ways. Along with a full compliment of talented artists this album is a must."
4,If you see it get it,"This is one of those unknown gems, sort of like Sir Bob in general. I'll tell you one thing I have been looking to reacquire this cd for a couple of years now. I haven't been obsessively searching daily or anything but I have been fairly consistent. I'm still stuck with an old tape that a friend gave me. The songs stick with you, offbeat rythms, quirky lyrics. If you see it, pick it up because it's good enough that you may never see it again"
4,No sign of slipping here,"Still the SF II V story becomes more complex and involving. Despite being 7 episodes long, the bulk of the story on this DVD takes place in one night as Ryu, Ken and Chun Li encounter Vega and Bison in a Spanish castle during a really shady dinner party and the murky plot thickens even more.The fight scenes are still hard-hitting and every 'set-piece' totally gripping. With so much going on there is never a dull moment in either of these episodes. Cammy is also introduced halfway through.The DVD is in 1.33:1 full frame, as drawn, with Dolby Stereo sound. Chapter stops are non-existant, or just limited to episode beginnings. Extras are just fluff trailers. Anyone who has the first 2 DVDs will have this one already so I guess there's no point in telling you to go out and get it right away."
2,Don't expect the movie Quality...,"I bought this DVD and while I am a fan of Street Fighter (Grew up on it and my dad owns an amusement company so I got to play the real thing =P)I hated the Series.This volume was the only one I picked up since they had it and vol 4 at circuit city and I'd never seen the SF Series so I decided to check it out.Here goes what to watch out for if You're considering buying it.What I expected was a quality around the area of the SWEET SF 2 Animated Movie (Buy it),this was not.The animation is odd looking in parts,I don't like the Voice acting (That's what Japanese Subbed is for) and this DVD Is hella fuzzy in picture quality.I was surprised to see the other good reviews but I guess It's a pretty good DVD If You've seen the series.But whatever you do,DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING NEAR THE MOVIE QUALITY,and try and rent before you buy on this one if you're a newbie to the series."
5,Great product for the price,"My main concern in looking for an eye cream was puffiness and dark circles. I use this at night and in the morning and it definitely has improved the overall look and moisture of the skin around my eyes. This has been much better than any drug store brand I have tried. Great purchase, will buy again!"
4,Hits the motherlode,"Blue Rodeo, for all intents and purposes, can be classified as a ""nice"" alt.country band. Most of their albums are pleasant and inoffensive, always containing a handful of memorable melodies and serviceable back-up. In other words: most of their albums are simultaneously professional, safe, and, dull. ""Diamond Mine,"" however, is their lone claim to immortality. It's not merely that this Mine sparkles with a clutch of Greg Keelor's and Jim Cuddy's best tunes, but throughout the album mad keyboard genius Bob Wiseman injects an element of musical anarchy that is completely at odds with the rest of the band's studied traditionalism. It's the aural equivalent of an epileptic mosher crashing a country 'n' western line dance, and it gives Blue Rodeo the weirdo edge they sorely require. Wiseman unfortunately left after this album, and Blue Rodeo, predictably and safely, returned to normal."
4,Quirky Heartland Rock,"Blue Rodeo's ""Diamond Mine"" is a would-be classic. I say ""would be"" because, while the album has some terrific songs, it contains a fair number of clunkers as well. The band's sound, when they aren't being experimental or downright weird, deftly blends country and folk styles with R.E.M.-like college rock. The highlights truly soar, particularly the gently rocking tunes ""Fall in Line,"" ""God and Country,"" and ""House of Dreams."" ""Girl of Mine"" is a first rate ballad and ""The Ballad of the Dime Store Greaser and the Blonde Mona Lisa,"" is a surprisingly good story song. On the downside, the album is interrupted by experimental instrumental tracks like ""Swells,"" and ""Blues Piano,"" that are intrusive sonic interruptions and a few of the other ""proper"" songs, like the tile track, are somewhat grating.Overall, four stars for an album that contains some very strong material but is maddeningly inconsistent."
3,Great Summer Practice,"This edition for 6th grade is more challenging than the 4th or 5th grade versions, but still a good workout for the brain especially during the summer when school is out and kids like to ""play"" on the computer. My daughter couldn't stop ""playing"" the 4th grade version. The 5th and 6th were less fun and more work, so it wasn't as easy to get her to do it."
3,it's a good lerning game but intertainment...,Hi well to start My Mom got this for me and I got excited cause it had Lestlie in it and they never make any games with her in it. I allways wondered why and this game told me. You can barely understand what she and Owan are saying and the game is really easy once you get the hang of it some games more then others. But the plot is less then amusing and the cluefinders are constantly bugging you to hurry up and it's really distracting.Well gotta go hope this was helpful Broke.
4,GREAT VALUE,"What a great value for the money. Cooks evenly, user friendly. I looked at lots of ovens with fancy features, but if you just want to heat frozen pizza, toast bagels, etc.. this is the best for the buck."
4,Decent toaster oven,I bought this toaster oven based on the price and because it came in black to match my other new appliances. It looks nice and works fine. It's slow to toast and broil but the bread comes out perfectly toasted so it's worth the wait. I have also baked chicken nuggets in the oven and they came out good. Good toaster for the price.
1,Is it Supposed to Double as a Smoke Machine??,"Twice I tried to turn this thing on and run it before actually putting food in it. Both times had smoke pouring out the sides vents and it smelled like it was about to catch fire. I understand manufactured products can produce a ""burning"" smell for a bit when turned on for the first time. But that's not what this was. There was literally smoke pouring out the sides."
4,Only 6 month Warrantee - BEWARE,"This is a good product; but Amazon's website is wrong and the warrantee is only 180 days... not 2 years.Also of note: this only has 2 heat elements, 1 on the top and 1 on the bottom in the center. This works reasonably well, but it doesn't work as well as my old Black and Decker which had 4. Less even browning."
3,uneven toaster,The heat distribution in this toaster is poor. One section of the bread will be black while another will be very lightly brown.
4,proctor silex toaster oven,This item was purchased as a gift for our daughter. So far it has performed very well and she has no complaints
4,Lunch/Breakroom,We have a small lunchroom and it's a busy place come lunchtime/breaks. Coffee/hot chocolate and reheating leftovers are primary around here. One guy makes a full breakfast of hash browns and eggs!! Microwave works well and we bought two of them that get a good work out. Satisfied with the product. Thank you
1,Not for us !,I returned this product after using it for a weeK. It does the jobs we bought it for poorly or not at all.
3,An okay toaster,"This toaster is okay. The first time I used it, it smelled like burning plastic; this went away after a few toast cycles and now it is fine. The toasting timer makes a loud clicking noise while it runs and ends with a loud bing. It also does not cook evenly---my taquitos come out with the ends burnt to a crisp and the middles not crispy at all.The crumb tray is nice. I like being able to pull it out and just dump all the crumbs in the sink when it builds up. The toast setting is not great in that it seems to either cook my toast too little (no color at all) or too much (deep brown all over); I have a hard time finding a setting in between that."
5,Can't Beat it for the Price,"For the money this is an awesome toaster oven. If you just put in the food and leave it it will not cook evenly, but if you flip and/or rotate it once in a while it comes out just fine, especially if you use a low heat setting for a longer time. The bake and broil options work great for heating up frozen food and one of my roommates has actually cooked chicken breast with the broil setting. I highly recommend wrapping the bottom tray in foil to speed clean up. In short, with some patience this thing is perfect for anyone with limited space and a limited budget."
3,Proctor Silex Toaster Oven,It does the job and the price was right. It puts off a bit more heat from the front and through the door than it should....
1,Fire!!!!!,"i havent the vaguest idea why my wife pressed BUY on this hideous 1970's looking piece of junk, but in doing so she rewarded me for my $40 by screaming ""FIRE!!!!"" 1 minute after plugging it in. It started burning up with smoke coming out of the right side. I highly recommend you buy this item if you are unhappy with your life circumstances and seek to retire from your time on this Earth."
1,Very disappointed,The toaster looks very nice on the counter. I think that is the one positive attribute I can mention. The door's weight does not seem evenly distributed. My family finds the ticking very unnecessary. Toast takes an enormously excessive amount of time to brown or even crisp. On three different occasions (with different foods) the top heating bar ignited. I will be shopping for another toaster that is safer and more efficient.
1,Smoking and Chemical Smell,"I bought this model because I have had a very similar model for 5+ years and it worked well so when it was time for a replacement, I was happy to find this oven at a good price. However, when I went to use this new model, smoke poured out of the 2 side vents and a chemical smell filled my kitchen. I immediately unplugged the oven and left it overnight to cool down. Thinking some moisture may have gotten into the oven during shipment, I tried it the next morning but the same thing happened. I obviously ended up returning this oven."
1,Broken Already,Bought this on Dec. 3 and the heating element is broken. One-third of it doesn't heat up.
4,why buy a toaster?,Good toaster oven for the money. Why buy something that can only heat one kind of food? I use this to heat all sorts of delicious things.
4,So far so good,"I haven't had the toaster long, but it is working great. Didn't think the 'toaster' part would work - but it did just fine. My only complaint is the timer is loud and annoying to listen too while it counts down. Good value."
4,Toaster-oven,I like this product. It is a little slow and uneven as far as toasting is concerned. I do not find his too objectional and familiarization will probably take care of it. This is the major use for me.
4,very happy,"I bought this toaster oven a few months ago, and I am very happy with it.It was a bit difficult getting used to the way the timer is compared to a push down knob for toasting. This is a great toaster though. I can bake a small pizza in it, without heating up the entire kitchen turning on the big oven. It toasts well (once you get used to the settings). Hopefully it will last as long as my last toaster oven did!UPDATE: November 17, 2010; I still have this product and it still works very well. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. I am impressed that I could actually make a small 8 inch pizza in it. I use it all the time. Esp in the summer when I use it to bake chicken instead of using the big oven. I have even made chocolate chips cookies in this, and they turned out just as they would in conventional oven."
4,Good buy,Not fancy. But it does the basic jobs well. Minor concern - better at baking than toasting. Toasting takes a little too long and is not totally uniform. But for the price this machine can't be beat.
3,OK while waiting for the perfect toaster oven,"Overall, like most toaster ovens I have purchased over the years, this one cooks a little uneven -- this one cooks too much on the top and too little on the bottom -- except when it goes the other way around.Good for warming up cold pizza, etc. Dries toast out a little. A good choice if want an alternative to a standard Black and Decker, and do not think that a basic toaster oven should cost over $50.(+ very eco-friendly when comparing it with using a full oven to warm something up.)"
1,This toaster is AWFUL!,"Don't buy this toaster- it's a fire hazard, I had to return it. Everything gets really hot, and you can't open the door or get your toast without scalding some part of your hand. Plus, it burns everything."
3,Yoga practice too slow,"I purchased this yoga DVD and a couple others to have some variety in my quickie morning yoga practice. I really like Rainbeau's voice and the succession of her poses, but I found the DVD a bit too slow. It is a beginner DVD so that may be the cause, but I've used Rodney Yee's beginner DVD's and still felt challenged."
2,Yoga,"Too easy. Even for a beginner, this is a slow and very simple video. I did not find it challenging at all, not even the first time. If you are looking for just a few stretches then check this video out, but if you are looking for a full yoga workout, this will be a disappointment."
4,rainbeau mars vinyasa flow for beginners,I have a deteriorating disc in by lumbar region and I've found that yoga helps. This CD is great for building up to more difficult asanas. I would reccommend this Cd to anyone trying to start getting back into shape.
4,For a true beginner,"I am a beginner, in that I have taken between 5-6 classes with an instructor. Although I like Rainbeau's style, and the music and sounds of crashing waves are nice, I don't feel at all challenged by this practice. If you are just starting out or are looking for easy, quiet stretching, this may be for you."
5,The Best,This steamer is used everyday in my home. Will not let you down and you will see how clean things are. Works real good for getting the pollen of the screens.
3,if you're happy and you know it,"the book i purchased was all right. i don't remember reading anywhere that a ""tab"" for the pop-up was missing. if i had read this i would have opted to purchase a new one.If You're Happy And You Know It, Clap Your Hands!"
2,Every day contractor use,"I bought 2 of these open faced rulers. They are not worth the extra money I paid for them. In a short period of time , you'll need bionic fingers in order to rewind the tape. The tape itself is fine. Just don't buy the fast rewind model. You will be disapointed. I have since ordered and recieved the regular model of this same ruler. Much much better. Quality is great."
5,Awesome AOR Rock,"Another band that came in a little too late. This album rocks and is nothing short of fun. A lot of catchy hook laden rockers here. ""Stranger than Paradise"" is a great some. The title track rocks, and so does the rest of the CD. I bought this album when it came out and never regretted it. If they would have came out in 87 they would have been huge. A must have for any hair metal fan."
2,"One tune killer, the rest pure FILLER","I bought this album for the excellent ""Stranger Than Paradise"", which is possibly the best 80's hair band song you've never heard - a fun, catchy tune with great group vocals on the chorus, stoopid lyrics, and equal parts crunch and melody. The one thing that partially separates it from the chaff is the guitar solo. The first part is done on mandolin, the second on typical loud electric guitar. Unfortunately, it's the only good tune on an otherwise generic CD. The titles say it all ""When The Brains Go To The Balls"", ""Girls Girls, Nasty Nasty""...you get the picture."
3,a good album but could have been better,"Sleez Beez was another hair band that represented the tail end of the 80's hair metal era.This album has a number of good songs on it including the excellent,""Stranger than Paradise"" which is the best song on here along with the title track,""Screwed blue and Tattooed"" and ""When the brains go to the Balls"" which packs a pretty good punch and was one of the few high points on this album.As for the rest of the CD,the songs are just OK,but not great.It was a bit over the top for my taste and seemed a bit stale as if they were in a hurry to release this album.The second album,Powertool is actually a better album even though it was largely ignored because of the grunge rock movement."
2,Do Not Recommend,"Problems:1. Will not scan document information in light blue colors.2. Sometimes cuts off lower 1/4th of the document.3. Documents sometimes jam in the feeder and are difficult to remove/pull out. (When that happens, I sometimes have to completely shut down my computer and restart.)I do not recommend this scanner.If you need to scan just documents, buy a Xerox scanner.Our office also has a Xerox Documate 250 vertical feeder scanner that is superior to the HP Scanjet.Feeding is much easier and documents rarely jam. If they do, they are easier to pull out.One advanced feature that the HP Scanjet 7650 has is the ability to scan 35mm negatives. I used this feature and it works. The drawback is that it takes a long time. It's a lot easier just to take the negatives to a nearby photo lab (Walmart and CVS Pharmacy are near me) and have the technician transfer the negatives (which convert to pictures) onto a CD-ROM for around $7.00. (Something like 144 pictures can be put on a CD-ROM.)"
3,Careful with HP7650 Scanner and USB,This scanner works great now. It only took two hours to figure out that the reason it would not work right is that I had a 20ft USB Cable. This scanner is very particular about cable and cable length so if you have trouble getting it running check to make sure your cable is no more than 16ft long (this is what they support). Also it does not seem to work well from the HP Director so we use the buttons on the front of the scanner. It has been working well otherwise and the ADF seems to hum along pretty well.
1,Poorly made item,The sheets are a very poor quality and what you are actually paying for is the steeler pillow case - certainly not worht $50 in a twin. Will be returning it immediately.
2,utter disappointment,"My son has been asking for a Diesel 10 ever since he discovered ""Day of the Diesels."" Unfortunately, this toy has been an utter disappointment. He is constantly telling me he wants to give this Diesel 10 away and get a better Diesel 10, which unfortunately (to my knowledge) does not exist for the wooden Thomas set. He repeatedly asks for a Diesel 10 with a working claw, which Learning Curve should be capable of making, especially since the claw is a key feature of Diesel 10 and clearly something attractive to kids."
4,Scooper doesn't have full range of motion,"This version of Diesel 10 looks great and is correct in scale as being the biggest engine. The only disappointment is that his scooper arm only slides back and forth; it does not have the full range of motion that you see the character use in the films. For this reason, I am expecting it to be broken when played with. The train itself swivels slightly on its wheels, but not enough to mimic that full range of motion. Still, it's a nice addition and his face is very true to the character's."
3,Disappointed,"I wasn't aware that it would be so small, so for the price I wasn't too pleased. However, due to it being a gift, it was received with a smile, so that made the difference."
1,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in my purchase. The face on Diesel 10 has changed and is NOT the one pictured. The Diesel 10 we received has a smiling, happy face with his teeth showing and happy looking eyes with no furrowed eyebrows. Unfortunately, I was trying to replace my son's lost Diesel 10 that looked like the one pictured, and I did not fool him. So basically, I wasted my money, and am still searching for the pictured Diesel 10."
5,Stirring Evocative Story,"This is a magnificent tale told in stunning passion, and I agree with the reviewers who believe this could be turned into a beautiful movie. Set against a backdrop of Roman History in World War II, the ships of Caligula and the myths of Diana as well as the haunting characters take center stage, grab your heart and never let go. And the end of the story is handled with a masterful touch of literary suspense, even up to the last line. A.R. Homer is an author whose star is rising and I dearly look forward to his next book.Other reviewers have explained about the book so eloquently that I cannot add more to their descriptions except to say that I too loved this book and highly recommend it."
4,"A wonderful read based on an important part of the war, with some unexpected twists and turns","This book was highly entertaining and engrossing, so much so that I gave it to my wife to read, and she enjoyed it as well. Engaging plot and every day characters make this a good read for most everyone. We like it so much we bought another by this author to see if his magic continues."
2,Not close to anything real or even fiction,I was really very disappointed with this book. I enjoy Alan Furst and Philip Kerr to name a few but this book fell far short. It is more like a beefed up outline for a book. The day to day life during the war in Italy is ok but since I live in Italy the situation the book centers around would be diffficult for anyone especially an Italian to believe.
5,Effective Advice; Easy to Understand and Apply,This book helped me re-focus and get back on track. It inspired me to take steps that would lead me in a direct path to achieving my ultimate career goal rather than being distracted by offers that would ultimately blur my vision for the future.
4,WHAT A BURN: THIS IS NOT A REVISED AND AUGMENTED EDITION.,"Some years ago I bought this same book, and I though that it was a revised version. It is not. Yes it has a new preface, and a new article, but both versions are identical, I mean the 1999 and the 2009 versions. They even have the same enumeration: they both start with page 1 (Introduction) and end with page 1040 (Index). Keep buying from amazon, but choose another commentary, if you bought the previous edition. If you are rich, go ahead the article ""Matthew and the Socio Rethorical ..."" (I don`t remember the title well) is good."
3,Not what I expected!,"I purchased this commentary, along with a few others, in preparation for my study on the Sermon on the Mount. As I started using this commentary, I discovered that it was not what I expected. It is subject to form/critical analysis (document Q, for example).As far as the exegesis goes, it is ok. There are others I would recommend higher than this (Carson in The Expositor's Bible Commentary; Blomberg in the NAC series; Hendriksen in the New Testament Commentary; Morris in the PNTC)."
1,A Sad Volume for a Series that had Potential,"Volume 4 is the worst anime I've seen in the SFII series, and is almost entirely a waste of money. Aside from the first and last episode of this volume, original footage was scarce. I felt it was almost a rehashing of the story line from the last volume. I had to skip or fast forward alot of the material to keep interest. I found it very bad quality when in important scenes, such as where Ryu and Ken are about to fight, to be complemented by elevator music. Overall a very bad volume; with reasons stated above also the development of Ki for Ken was just awkward."
1,Street Fighter II,"This whole series was really bad, it was boring and slow not a whole lotta action here bubs."
4,Great ending to a fantastic series,"As per usual , audio and video quality of the 8 episodes contained on this last volume of Street Fighter II V are excellent.Concerning the story , I agree with other reviewers that the plot could have been reworked to allow all the characters a chance to develop sufficiently. But there is tons of actions and well-acted drama.One big problem is the constant re-use of footage from past episodes..but I guess they were on a tight budget.The music is fantastic ...to the skeptics, that j-pop music that plays during the dramatic scenes do work really well.Extras are decent , but they could have added more trailers or some conceptual sketches.And they should have left in the original intro and ending music...slag the techno remix!"
4,Street Fighter II V Series Volume 4,"this series is so awesome!!!!!! by far one of the best anime fighter series of all time, if not the best period. I have seen the whole series on vhs and already have the first three volumes on dvd and can't wait to get 4, im already giving it a 4 stars beacuse i know it'll rock!!!! A must for all street fighter fans"
4,Detailed and Interesting,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It gave new insight on my travels to Japan and experiencing they're culture. It is dense and someone repetitive however and feels very like a text book which is the only reason it lost a star. Great detail and information about the culture, economics, and politics of Japan through the year 2000. I will probably read Lost Japan by Kerr next."
4,So I`m not alone!,"As a student studying abroad in Japan, I have to say that Kerr`s book was like a breath of fresh air. Ever since I arrived here I`ve known something was wrong - something was causing me to be utterly disillusioned. I thought it was only culture shock (and it may be, I`m still not sure), but I think it has more to do with what Kerr has written about. The environment I`ve encountered has been little more than glitzy, pop-culture, flashy trash, with a back drop of construction, concrete, concrete, and more concrete. Unless I can get over the shock and disillusionment, I may end up doing what another reader did: cutting my losses."
3,An excellent 50 page article...,"This is an excellent and insightful examination of why Japan gets some things so wrong. However, it could have been said just as well in a 50 page magazine article. That 50 page article is instead stretched into a 320 page book. When I got to the point in the book where Kerr was saying the same thing for the third time, I put it down. However, for anyone who does business with the Japanese or is thinking of living there, it's still worth reading the first hundred pages or so."
5,"Excellent look from ""the other side of the fence""","One of the worst problems with the study of Japan is that their society keeps everything hidden from disapproving eyes of foreigners. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to have a sober, realistic view of the country.The author did an excellent work not only in the research, but also in the courageous exposition of his own ideas about the causes of the problems.Excellent book, a must-have for students of international relations."
1,Save your money,"In addition to being outdated, I do nt think it was ever accurate. 10 years on most predictions were wrong. I just heard him speak yesterday and he has not adjusted his views to actual facts. If you want to read it, I recommend a library copy."
4,what next?,"Dogs and Demons is Alex Kerr's examination of where Japan is today economically, socially, and internationally; and how it got there. It is not a book about Japanese art; it is not a history book. It is an exploration of the workings of modern Japan. It sometimes reads like a lecture, sometimes like a vindication; but it is written with deep love for the country and if it seems determined in its indictment, this is only the result of a passion for the subject. Read it alongside his other book, Lost Japan, which deals more with the art and culture of the nation, if you want to understand where he is coming from, or if you want a more rounded picture of the developments he is describing. Don't worry about re-reading the same material the books are very different and both are well worth the time. If I can be forgiven the phrase, he really is an author ""anyone with even a cursory interest in the subject should read."""
3,Best Review of Dogs and Demons,"The best published review of this book was written by Ian Buruma for THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS, July 5, 2001. It highlights the strengths and weaknesses. Japan's system is changing--without Kerr's help from Thailand."
2,hyperbole,"Alex Kerr's argument seems to have won a lot of readers over, not necessarily with cogent points & a judicious use of factual evidence, but with heated statements that border on hyperbole. While hyperbole is not necessarily bad, and can be used to great effect at times, Kerr's overuse of it ruins the one good point he had--namely his expose, as it were, (he himself admits he doesn't have access to all the facts) of the central government's corruption. For example, he explains that all of Japan's rivers & seacoasts have been covered over in concrete, when this is definitely not the case. I highly doubt Kerr visited every river, stream, & coast in Japan to confirm this very dubious & completely ridiculous OVERSTATEMENT. Given the tendency for overstatements, it seems that perhaps Kerr wrote the book elsewhere & relied more on his memory (which as everyone knows can distort) than direct observation."
1,Ethnocentric white-suprematist view of Japan,"If you want to read an ethnocentric white-suprematist view of Japan, this is it. It's thinly disguised but nevertheless obvious that this author thinks he's better than the Japanese and feels he has something to preach. With his sweeping generalizations and I-am-better-than-you attitude, the author only succeeds in telling us that he lives in Japan so that he can feel superior to the rest. It was so atrocious that I couldn't even finish this book."
2,Not Quite Right.,"Kerr wrote that his neighbour had stopped gardening . Owing to the demands of the construction industry . Yet the same woman provided Alex Kerr with cabbages , potatoes , Hakusai And other physical and moral comfort during his spells in the old place .Mr Kerr wrote that the woman had abandoned her fields , but this is patently untrue . Kerr was well looked after in Japan ,moresoever than other unfortunates . He should recognise his time in Japan as a gift , not as a Polemic to rail against the nation."
4,Worth Reading If You're Interested in Japan,"This deeply pessimistic book about contemporary Japan is often repetitive, but I still recommend it for any person who is interested in the subject. Japan has been very good to Mr. Kerr, both personally and professionally. Therefore, Mr. Kerr's case for Japan's current malaise cannot be dismissed as the opinion of an embittered expatriate. This is how negative books about Japan written by foreigners are typically viewed. Nor can one say that Mr. Kerr does not know Japan well enough to write about it; he lived there for 35 years from the time he was a little boy, and I presume he is fluent in Japanese. This book is something to be taken seriously.I think a good measure of a book's quality is how quickly or eagerly one reads it. Well, I basically put aside all other business and read ""Dogs and Demons"" in a few days. I didn't want to put it down."
1,Stick to Movies,"Thin, unsupported voice sings uninteresting interpretations, barely on pitch. Just listen to a couple of the samples to see for yourself."
5,"Ummm, it works...",How much can you really say about it? It allows me to charge my Treo 600 in my car and it works. I'm happy with it.
1,"listed as Palm, it is an LG charger with a Palm connector","listed as Palm, it is an LG charger with a Palm connector shoved on the end. it broke within 4 months. How they use the Palm name is beyond me...it is a fake."
5,This stuff really works !!!! Don't believe the negative comments,"My wife had oral surgery last week, it was an especially difficult extraction tooth 31. On the 4th day she was in extreme pain from dry socket. I had several packs of this stuff left over from having a crown done several weeks before. At 3:00 am I found her in the bathroom crying about the pain she described as ""white pain"". I did not have any clove oil left in the house, so I gave her the rincinol to try cuz she was in distress....Within 5 mins of application the pain she was experiencing had diminished to the point where she was able to manage it and within 20 mins, she had gone back to sleep. From my perspective, this product was just what was needed to get over a very difficult situation in the middle of the night. It did not remove all of the pain, but we were not expecting a miracle. The product worked very wellI hopethat others will find this review helpful."
4,ulcers in your mouth?,My husband uses this when he gets ulcers in his mouth. They heal much quicker and is soothing. It is the very best thing we have ever tried.
4,Relief from mouth pain,I have used this product many times for canker sores. This product helps to relieve the pain & enables you to eat & drink without too much pain.
4,bumps be gone!,"My children recently caught hand, foot and mouth and i ended up catching it also. This mouth rinse does a moderate job of reliving the pain and it helps make the mouth sores disappear faster. It left a noticeable coating in my mouth that gave slight relief to the pain. I would use this in conjunction with Tylenol for pain."
1,Not recommended.,Interesting story idea but if you get motion sickness this is not the movie to see. I get the concept but with all the spinning and moving camera work had to look away until the picture got back to normal. Very violent rape scene that went too far.
3,Irreversible,"Very difficult to watch. Some of the film was to dark to see the action. Also, the spinning camara effects were difficult to take. I like foreign films and am glad I purchased. The violence in this movie does appear real and will shock."
2,Weird,This movie is very weird and it makes you really dizzy. It shows you the end first and then shows you the events that lead up to it. Not a movie for children at all!
4,Brutal yet innovative cinema,"The brutality in this movie begins almost from the start. It is in the form of revenge. The reason for the revenge is a rape; brutal and violent in itself. Neither episodes are for the visually faint-hearted. Yet the innovation in this film is to reverse the entire sequence of events in this short period of life (assumed to be a day or two). There are vignettes; like the scene on the metro-train when 'she' is explaining to a friend what a woman sometimes likes in love-making from her man. This has nothing to do with violence. In short, the film is not for the squeamish, it is disturbing at times and yet, sometimes, this is what cinema should be.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
3,Awsome,"Quite awsome,these events do take place in this world we live in,whilst the film makers may have pushed the boundaries why not show them-obviously not for the faint hearted of course!"
3,3 stars for Monica Belluci but that's it!,"I watched this movie and can only give it 3 stars for Monica Belluci's haunting performance. Otherwise, the movie made me sick to my stomach. I'm no shrinking violet and adore Hong Kilm action films. A very ugly tale of revenge and brutality with plenty of gore. The rape scene was horrific and seemed to last forever - I ended up skipping this scene. I cannot believe this film garnered as much acclaim as it did. Brutal, brutal picture."
3,"Hard to watch, and not because of the rape scene.","It's hard to watch because it's hard to take ANY of the main characters seriously, because they're all classic French drama queens! Every second, every one of them is practically bursting with comically exaggerated emotions (unintentionally comic, that is), foaming at the mouth, convulsed by kaleidoscopic and manic flashes of existential angst/despair/desire/frustration/rage/etc. It's like watching a bunch of moths on PCP bouncing off the insides of a Mason jar. Ah, the passion, the passion...(So THIS is what the Buddhists call ""the comedy of the ego."")The film is kind of like a film version of Martin Amis' book, ""Time's Arrow"" which tells a story backwards. Interesting gimmick/concept, but results in a barely watchable film, especially given the erratic and deliberately artsy-fartsy camera work (practically nauseating during the beginning of the film)."
1,Believe the 1 Star reviews,"I ignored the 1 star reviews at my peril, but they were right, this film has nothing to commend it. What a waste."
4,"Brutal, shocking, amazing! A Stunner!","Movies like this don't come around too often. Yes, this is an extremely violent film. Yes, there is a rape scene that seems like it was really happening, and is VERY hard to watch. Was it worth paying $9 to see? My answer: Not that I am into sadistic violence or cruelty, but I saw it twice.The way this story is told in reverse order from ugliness to serenity is what entices me the most about this film. Noe is really communicating something here that I feel everyone should see, as shocking and intense as it is.The camera work here is fantastic, the acting equally fantastic. I applaud Gaspar Noe for having the courage to produce a film this bold and moving. I won't see a film this engaging for quite some time. It only played at the local Landmark theatre for two short weeks. Bring on the DVD. I want many of my friends to experience this humanistic vision. It is a ride well worth it."
1,irreversible,this is a lousy movie with no script or plot to it.also very bad acting.I would not recommend this to anyone
1,IRREVERSIBLE,"THIS WAS A POORLY DIRECTED AND EDITED FILM THAT MADE ME FEEL AS IF I WEREON A ROLLERCOASTER. ALSO WITH TODAYS TECH THIS DVD COULD HAVE OFFERED THEENGLISH LANGUAGE IN THE AUDIO SECTION, ESPECIALY SINCE ALL THE ACTORS INTHIS FILM ACTUALY SPEAK ENGLISH. MONICA BELLUCCI WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS EVER,HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS FILM"
1,Do not waste your money,"This ranks as one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The whole story was terrible. Waste of time, typical foreign dubbed movie."
1,terrible terrible TERRIBLE,"why won't anyone tell the truth about this movie? probably because if they did, no one would watch it. this movie starts off with the worst camera work i've ever seen in a movie... it's bad. and i mean bad. and i mean REALLY BAD. for example, it will show a light overhead or something scrolling past about 5,000 times. seriously, that's what passes for ""art."" that's supposed to have ""meaning."" you've gotta be kidding me. i can't believe anyone can watch this garbage for more than 5 minutes. i made it about 15 or so waiting for something to happen. a total waste of time. i'm sure the story is good, but this director is a pretentious moron. oh yeah, it's a french movie... i think i'll skip french movies from now on. no wonder everyone hates the french, making pretentious ""art"" like this and thinking they're superior to americans!"
2,No balance,"A good wine is a balance of acid and sweetness. This movie was all acid and left a sour taste in my mouth. If a filmmaker wants me to watch violence and cruelty fine, it can be interesting but not without a point to it. This movie struck me as a product of a filmmaker intentionally trying to be controversial and artsy and failing. No doubt people will blather on about the time space continuum and how clever he was to run the plot backwards but if you run any other movie backwards there's still a point to most of them. If you like violence, sadism, and 'artsy' for their own sake this may be your film. Otherwise choose again because this film offers nothing else to satisfy."
1,bad,"horrible movie, the story and the acting are horrible. I wouldnt waste any money or time on this one if i were you."
1,Could have been better.,"This movie tried too hard! The story line was all over the place. I love these actors in other movies but in this the entire movie is a mishmash of all kinds of confused fillers. As the others stated, Rape scene is extremely disturbing but in the overall plot of the movie, there was no reason for a 10 minute rape scene anyway! Can't recommend the movie, it was boring and tried to hard to mold itself in the new extreme french bandwagon."
1,Nauseating,Plenty of people have already explained why this movie is awful. I just had to cast my vote in with the one-star crowd. Many directors have tried to show the true nature of senseless violence; I have never seen one who succeeded until now.
1,awful,"This movie is disturbing on so many levels, and the graphic 11 minute scene is horrifying! I hate this movie"
2,Extremely violent / graphic.,"If you're into violence, brutal sex then you would enjoy this. Its not what I thought. I fast forward most of it trying to catch a story line and found a sliver of one. As I said, its not for me."
1,I must've watched an edited version,because this movie was boring. I just watched it on netflix and I struggled to stay awake to find the soul shattering and the disturbing. I didn't see neither. It was violent that's about it.
1,Very Bad Movie for Several Reasons,"I bought this movie and must say I was deeply disturbed by the violent portral of the rape of the actress. Her face being kicked and punched to a pulp was utterly sick. I realize this must happen in real life, and I am truly sorry for women this happens to, I just don't need to see it in my home.Another feature of the film that made me almost seasick from the start was the camera technique of swirling the camera around and tilting it different directions. I guess if one is high on acid, this makes sense?This review is my own personal opinion and I don't expect anyone to be impressed, only hope to help some folks avoid wasting their money on a worthless movie.If I could return it, I would do so, I guess I will hang the CD in my garden to scare away the birds!Save your money and don't buy this worthless effort. IMHO"
1,incomplete,"hey, how do i kill 15 minutes of film time? oh.......i could rotate the camera endlessly to make the first scene unwatchable. ""showgirls"" is easier on the viewer than this film. the fight and killing is well done and brutally real. however the whole ""artistic"" (heavy sarcasm) aspect of the first chapter ruins everything to the point of ""just let me be done with this thing"". i quit this film quicker than the french quit world war II."
5,reverse this....,"this has got to be the most intense movie I have seen in (ok i am going to say it) MY LIFE! I even had to pause and take stock of my soul twice before the completion of this shocking story in reverse. Lock your doors before watching,REALLY."
1,good story bad filming,"I was intrigued by other viewer's reviews and decided to watch this film. It's not the content of the film that bothered me as much as the cinema photography did. I spent too much time focusing on the video, then the subtitles, then the actual story! Its not a pleasant story but the capturing of a violent act by some sicko really hits home to normal males that care about their female loved ones. The movie could have been made better but the story line is definitely worth sharing."
4,"French, tough, voilent - this is a cool exploitationer....","A little roughie!This gem, caused up a bit of a stir becuase of the rape scene which admittedly went on a bit long - but that was the point was it not - to make us uncomfortable. The story is told backwards, with cool cinematography, motion control cameras all over the place and documentary realistic type shooting. Its nihilistic and downbeat for sure, buts its also powerful and highly disturbing piece of cinema.But be prepared if you are not used to these movies you wont like it, but a really well produced and ballsy movie!recommended for strong stomachs and strong minds :-)"
3,WORTH A LOOK FOR THE CAST-IRON STOMACH,"if you want to see a film that will make an emotional(albeit negative)impact on your psyche,here it is!as many others have pointed out,the violence (PARTICULARLY the rape scene)will make most viewers reach for the barf-bag.this isn't mindless ""entertainment"" but an EXPERIENCE.an experience one may not wish to go thru again,so i'm not too sure of the re-playabilty value of owning the dvd.well worth a look though for the adventurous"
3,The underbelly of man's depravity in rewind.,"From the start you are sent reeling as the spiraling camera work leads you down through a darkened gay sex dungeon to a scene of revenge inspired violence. The rape scene which spawns this vengeance is unflinching and brutal to the point of nausea. As the movie unwinds in reverse time the seemingly normal and unassuming events that lead up to this nightmare have a creepy subtlety, since you have already witnessed the bitter end. A harsh movie, but worth seeing as long as you take the honest depiction of such an act."
4,Scarred for life.,"Scarred for life is an understatement. This movie will cut into your conscience like a fine razor. Even days after the wound will burn, reminding you of what you saw. But make no mistake, this is incredible film-making. It pushes new boundaries and awakens us to the power of raw, human, reality.Watch it."
3,"""Disturbing""","I first heard about this film from a friend of mine who has worked in the film industry. His review was simply one word: ""disturbing."" My interest piqued, I researched the film online, eventually landing here on Amazon. I was amazed by the myriad reactions, both positive and negative... I felt I had to see this movie for myself. Having seen it, I am left without words to describe it...I suggest to anyone interested that you read these reviews. I agree with just about every single person's viewpoint of this film, from the praise of the filmmaking and acting to the horror and disgust over the intense violence and seediness. The bottom line is this: I saw it, and I'm neither glad nor regretful that I did. But my advice is that you rent or borrow this film, not purchase it. My copy will remain on my shelf without being viewed a second time.My friend was correct. It is truly disturbing."
2,Not worth the hype OR the hatred,"The simple truth is, this movie is boring. Yes, it has a really long (not to say interminable) rape scene in it, and yes, some guy gets his head smashed in with a fire extinguisher. But so what? It's still boring. We just sort of drift around from moment to moment, through what seem to be virtually unscripted scenes, backwards through the ""story,"" which has pretty much no focus or ultimate impact. Then it's over and you get to do something more interesting, like shine the silverware. Don't get me wrong, I like dark and disturbing films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, anyone?), but I prefer them to at least be interesting and involving. I'd take anything David Cronenberg ever made over this, and I'm including the early stuff."
2,Pretentious and Mediocre,"This is by far the most pretentious piece of French crap I have seen in years. What bothers me are not the admittedly disturbing scenes, but rather the banality of the film's underlying idea, which the director, Gaspar Noe, attempted to convey in a thoroughly unremarkable fashion. The characters are not shown in any depth; in fact, there is no meaningful dialogue or any other attempt at all to introduce them to the viewer. Camera work is simply awful - somebody should have explained to the cameraman that rotating a hand-held camera at will for minutes at a time does not always produce art. Apparently, these sterile methods combined with shocking scenes of rape and murder are supposed to produce a new form of cin√©ma v√©rit√©.In short, even though in France almost every baker is an ""artiste"" (think ""baguette artisanale""), Mr. Noe is not a ""cin√©aste"" even by French standards: hit someone in the face with a teakettle and call it art!"
4,Gaspar No√© is pushing the audience into a dark sphere...,"In Irreversible, the director Gaspar No√© is pushing the audience into a dark sphere where the audience is exposed to some truly brutal violence as if No√© wants to educate the ignorant minds of the masses. Thus, No√© is creating a very offensive experience as the story is told in reverse where the audience already knows of the coming events as the story unfolds. The story itself will not be revealed here, however, the violence is extremely grotesque and might cause distress and disgust among the audience members. However, behind the nastiness there is something to be pondered that might leave the audience with an echo ringing ""You cannot escape your actions."" The cinematography is cleverly tied together with each frame, and it leaves the audience with a disturbing and distressing cinematic experience that might affect their sleeping patterns."
3,Be aware of technocal shortcomings,"I agree with most previous comments on the film.Title sequences and menus are very memorable, as is the soundtrack.As mentioned by some on Netflix, the technical transfer of this film renders a poor image on some systems. Much of the action takes place at night, and there is alot of interference. perhaps the worse I've seen. Not unwatchable, but it may handicap the movie. Consider renting first..."
2,Defines 'gratuitous violence'.,"Although I realize Gaspar Noe's entire idea was to shock viewers, I can't help but be disgusted by him and his film. 'Irreversible' is certainly a film that challenges viewers. However, not in any conventional way. Noe challenges viewers to keep watching as a woman is brutually raped for 11 minutes. This scene is shown in all its horror without a single cut. The film is structured somewhat like ""Memento"" in that is is shown backwards. This is one of the redeming qualities of the film. The film opens with one of the most violent and realisitc looking scenes where a man is beaten with a fire extinguisher for sometime after he is alrady dead. His skull is smashed into what resembels a crushed melon. It seems like the ideas and and intesity of the film could have come across without all of this excessive brutality. The plot is basically that a man is searching for the man who raped his girlfriend. When in fact the true rapist is Noe himself."
1,Undue Violence,"I rated this film *1* out of *5* because I had to abandon my viewing. The violence was graphic beyond what is tolerable for a person with sensibilities within what might be considered normal. I am no prude; this is the first film I ever abandoned due to violence. I am male and if I ever _do_ abandon a film, I will abandon it out of boredom -- not violence. Stay away."
