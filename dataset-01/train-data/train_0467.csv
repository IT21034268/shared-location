5,snugglesafe,I received this product right on time and my cats love it. I feed and house several show up kitties and this product is great for keeping them warm in the coldest of weather.
2,Warming Discs,"I ordered 2 of these for our newborn puppies at the suggestion of a friend who loves hers. I looked at the wattage on my microwave and heated it at the recommended length of time. it was BARELY warm.... certainly not enough to keep a new puppy warm. I increased the time little by little and stopped trying at 4 minutes, for frear that it would explode. (Instructions are clear that you are not to heat longer than they say). It also said it remains warm for 10 hours. That didn't happen either.Our electricity goes out often and we wanted to be sure the pups stayed warm if that happened. Very disappointed. Even tho the puppies were in our dining room, we would have had a major problem if the electricity went out."
4,warm and happy cats,"easily heated, held warmth through the night in chilly garage.the only improvement would for the item itself to be a little softer(for my old, skinny cat)"
5,Geat product,Works great for new puppies. Stays warm as it advertises. I would highly recommend this product to people who breed dogs.
5,Fantastic!,"I've only had this a few days, but I'm very impressed. I got it for my 3 pound Yorkie. It is very hard, but I just put it under a blanket and it keeps him warm without being too hot. He just curls up on the blanket and loves it. Just 5 minutes in the microwave and it has stayed very warm for at least 10 hours so far. Love it!"
5,A must have for bringing home a 6-8 week old puppy,"I'm a lab breeder and highly recommend new puppy owners to have one of these Snuggle Safe Heat Pads ready for their first night at home with their new puppy. It offers comfort to a restless puppy missing the warmth of a puppy huddle. I own two of these warmers and use them for the puppies and for myself to soothe a sore back. This is a great product, it's durable and well worth the investment."
1,Beware!,"This product started a fire on our patio in the cat bed placed in a wooden chair..........and burned all of the teak patio furniture (including the umbrella) to the ground.......even melted the one nearby plastic lawn chair to a puddle. Yes, I know that it isn't supposed to be hot enough to start a fire, and yes, it seemed perfect for keeping an outdoor cat warm in the winter, but this product clearly DID START the fire, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone at any time under any circumstances. I'll be reporting the incident (complete with pictures) to the company, the consumer reports organization and the consumer protection agency in my state. BEWARE!"
1,Not impressed at all.,"Multiple times I have heated the SnuggleSafe according to the directions, and the pad never gets hot enough to generate enough heat to penetrate the fleece cover. It doesn't radiate heat the way I had hoped it would. I'm afraid to overheat the pad in the microwave (as the instructions caution against), and I worry the pad will be too hot for my pet if I remove the pad from the cover. I should have thought better about buying the SnuggleSafe anyway - from the pictures it's obviously very hard and probably not comfortable to lie on. (If you pad it more, then the heat will never get through to your pet.) My cat has no interest in it."
4,The Yakuza,Excellent story... the characters are believable and the movie has a twist that will break your heart. The actors became the characters. They bring you to Japan and they're way of thinking. The HONOR among the Japanese can be a little overwhelming to the American mind. DEEP!!!
3,Good - but not so much.,"I like certain elements of this film, however, this movie moves at a rather slow pace and some of it is more than a little bit cheesy. It does have a good tone and setting. Ken Takakura is great in this movie. I am a Robert Mitchum fan (Out of the Past is one of my all-time favorite movies) but, although he is ok in this movie, this is not his finest hour by far. That being said, if you can get this movie for less than 10 bucks it would be worth your time."
5,The Yakuza Review,Great movie. This movie was playing at a drive in on our honeymoon over 35 years ago. The weather got bad and was cancelled after 20 minutes. We never did see the movie again until now. Great to be able to buy the old movies at a reasonable price.
2,The Sequel that Bombs,"This was a bit of a disappointment. First, if you were hoping for a coach's principles on leadership in business, go back to the ""Business"" section of the bookstore. I understand that by targeting the business world Brad can increase his book sales beyond the sports junkies of the world, but in relating his coaching to other life applications, well...he leaves a bit of a gap.I really enjoyed ""Winning Ugly"". In fact, as a tennis player, I found it loaded with great tips (and it even improved my game). But this one is loaded with Brad's ""good ole days from the tour"" drivel that is certainly is out of date and more than a bit tedious."
3,"I've got your back, back, back......","Big Gilbet fan, huge disciple of Winning Ugly! This is a completely different read. Not deep, but good, interesting sections on what he, as a coach, actually does on a professional level. His interaction with the player, insights, his influences. Book did tend to be repetitive - ok, once I'm told how great his relationship with Agassi and Roddick is, it's doesn't need to be harped on over and over, chapter after chapter. Hopefully the next book will be a little more strategic. Would like to see highlight tapes of some of his old matches(especially w/Becker) showing him applying his techniques. Should be a companion item for Winning Ugly."
1,A complete waste of time,I was very glad that I borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste any money on it. I skimmed through it and found it to be a huge disappointment for a fan of the series. Ms. Gabaldon must think pretty highly of herself to write a book about writing the 'Outlander' seeries or she just wants to cash in on their popularity.
1,I Wouldn't Really Know...,"The book was never received. I emailed the seller THREE TIMES, but all I got was a generic email telling me the book was delivered. That may be true, but it was never RECEIVED by me."
5,A Supurb Filler,"As a great fan of Diana's work, I was getting a bit desperate waiting for the next installment of Jamie and Claire's adventures when my best friend gave me a copy of THROUGH THE STONES. I started reading it at once finding I came to understand the characters even better and found that Diana is a truly inspiring person. How can anyone have crammed so much life into so short a time and still stayed sane? I am full of admiration.I particularly enjoyed the maps and descriptions of Scotland as well as the recipes and other miscellaneous information that Diana saw fit to include. This makes the characters seem more real somehow. I eagerly await the new instalments"
4,Exactly what it was MEANT to be!,"I admit, this book isn't one that I would buy on hardcover; however, that DOESN'T mean that it's a bad book. I thought it was really quite good considering it's a companion to the series. I found all the numerous little bits of information Ms Gabaldon included in the Companion very entertaining and interesting. To the readers that thought this Companion was supposed to be every bit as good as one of the Outlander novels, you need a huge reality check. Ms Gabaldon wrote this for her fans in order to give them what they wanted -more info on the Outlander series! And what is all this about ""only doing it for the money?"" Don't authors make their livings selling books?!!! Not to mention that this companion book is a million times better than what most authors can write!"
2,"Love the series, but was this necessary?","Call me cynical, but ""The Outlandish Companion"" strikes an odd chord in me. Yes, the books are great, but do you really need to know Jamie and Claire's horoscopes, not to mention the minutiae of very minor characters' lives? The books, although lengthy, are not that hard to follow. I'm sure Ms. Gabaldon had fun putting this together, but it smacks of time buying and audience baiting. It's been three years since ""Drums of Autumn,"" and despite predictions ""Fiery Cross"" is nowhere in sight. If you're an absolute diehard Jamie and Claire fan, this is a must have (and you probably already do). We more patient sorts will wait for ""Fiery Cross."""
1,If you like to read dictionaries and encyclopedias...,"No seriously, I could understand how many a fan would devour anything by Diana Gabaldon and I thought I was one of those people; but The Outlandish Companion was something I could have done without. I enjoyed her personal story about how she got started with the series but other than that I struggled through it. The recommended books section; which was the main reason I purchased this book, was a disappointment. I hated many of the books I picked from the list in the back of the companion. I get the impression that Ms. Gabaldon is very intellectual. I just think I'll wait patiently for the rest of the books in this series."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST!,"I have never read any books so interesting and intriguing as these. I actually feel like I'm going through withdrawls, when I don't get to read everyday. I just happen to finish the last book, and it took me about two weeks to finish the last 4 or 5 chapters, only because I didn't want it to end. I love the way Diana writes, she has a way of making you feel like you are experiencing what Jamie and Claire are experiencing. Like you are actually there and feeling the emotion of their trials and tribulations. I can't wait for the other books to come out. I have already told my family that I will be MIA (missing in action) for the first couple of days after I get the book, so that I can read without ANY interuptions!"
4,A good companion,Not exactly what I expected but overall a good companion for the Outlander series. I think it was worth the price just to find out how to correctly pronounce Laoghaire (which in my mind was pronounced as Log-hair).
1,Bad Gaelic!!!!,"As a learner of Scottish Gaelic, I picked up this book to see what kind of ambassador for the language Diana Gabaldon was. Needless to say, I am disapointed. If she is going to use a language she could at least get it right. It is very sad that this might be some peoples only exposure to this beautiful language. Please hire an expert next time!!!"
5,Wonderful Book for Outlandish Fans & New Readers!,"Diana Gabaldon is simply the best storyteller I have ever read and I have read extensively. The Outlandish Companion is a must have for Gabaldon fans - it's chock full of terrific information. For new readers, it's a great introduction to a wonderful author. Thank you for another wonderful book, Diana!"
2,Nice but I would have rather had book 5,"The companion book to me was a disappointment. Much of the information that was in this book is available on Diana's web site. I would much rather have had Diane release book 5 and 6 before getting this published. (You then really could have a companion to the series) I do enjoy Diane's books but after reading this campanion book, I feel that as a fan as I was taken for advantage by buying this book.(Some balm to sooth my cravings but it ISN'T enough!) In spite of this I am waiting most anxiously for the next books and am looking forward to the hope that Diana will give us a ""presequal"" too!!"
5,Up To Snuff,"As usual, Ms. Gabaldon presents clear, crisp reading. The novels are soul-satisfying in their very evident imagination, research and hard work, and the Companion only fleshes out their creator, her hectic lifestyle and remarkable ability to assemble puzzles. I'm sure the input and assistance of your on-line friends helped tremendously in putting the right edge on scenes that were problematic for you, Ms. Gabaldon, but, if I may ask, why did you feel it necessary to defend yourself to them when they asked their pertinent questions? Of course you adhered to historical fact as much as possible, but it seems that creative license needs no defense if used as you so impressively have. Thank you for the Companion. It is firmly ensconced on my ""favorites"" library shelf with its cousins. I look forward to The Fiery Cross in late 1999 (?)"
3,For collectors of Outlander series.,"If you are a fan of the Outlander series, this is the book for you. It may not be everything you ever wanted to know about Jamie and Clare, but it is the answer to the most asked questions as far as the author, Diane Gabaldon knows. She offers a brief explanation as to how she writes. Also she gives background as to character, place and history. The problem is that there is no index, and the series is not complete. So there will be a new edition updated or an addendum. This book is strictly for the fan as a collector's item."
5,Can't wait for the next book..,I definately can't wait for the next book! I picked up the first three books at a garage sale last year and finished them all within a matter of months. Then bought the fourth. I have been waiting none too patiently for the next book and plan to buy and read this one till it does come out! Hope it's as good as the others!
5,Can't get enough and can't wait for the next one!,These books are the only ones I've ever read that can make me laugh out loud and cry and get really mad and make me think of all the possibilities in life...and each book provokes this in me! Diana Gabaldon has a flair and a wit that is truly rare and I highly recommend anything she writes to anybody who enjoys escapism reading at its very best!
1,"Come on. The books were good, but this is going too far.","Can you say, ""money making scheme""??? That's all this is. Seriously folks, no one should really care this much about a fictional world. I really enjoyed reading the books, and someone gave this to me as a gift. And it lowers my respect for the whole series. Just enjoy the books for what they are - fictional stories - and forget delving into character pasts. Man."
5,THESE BOOKS ARE POWERFULLY WRITTEN WITH HEART AND SOUL...,"HAVING BEEN LEAD TO THIS SERIES OF BOOKS BY A FRIEND AT THE LIBRARY, I WAS AMAZED AT THE IMPACT THEY HAD ON ME..... I COULDN'T PUT THEM DOWN, AND IN 5 DAYS HAD READ ALL FOUR OF THEM. I THEN SET OUT TO PURCHASE THEM TO HAVE TO READ OVER AND OVER, AND HAVE DONE THAT TOO. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE, AND HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT THE COMPANION THAT DIANA WROTE, AS A PART OF MY SET..... MS GALBADON, YOU ARE A WONDERFUL WRITER, AND BRING A GREAT DEAL OF ENTERTAINMENT TO THOSE OF US, WHO HAVE BECOME YOUR FANS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, AND PERSONALLY, YOUR BOOKS MAKE ME VERRA VERRA HAPPY!"
1,a real disappointment,"as much as I loved the novels, I am so disappointed at this money making scheme."
5,Outlander Companion,I have been a Diana Gabaldon fan for years starting with Outlander when it first came out. This book is a lot of fun. It has symnopsis of all the books up of the first four books in the series. I am so happy that Ms Gabaldon took time to write a book that explains it all. The Gaelic pronounciations are wonderful. The breakdown of all the characters and this history of the time period is marvelous. She did a wonderful job. She will remain one of my favorite all time authors.
5,outlandish companion,"I have read every book in the Diana Gabaldon series. By having the companion, I was able to have a lot of questions answered and found it fun and interesting to read background information on this series. Diana will have to make another one to cover the books written after the companion was published. I don't want the books to end. I will probably start over again from the beginning."
4,I Understand the Critisisim,"Yes, I understand where you're coming from. I was kind of dissipointed too. I thought the horoscopes were inapropriate. Even though I was not as impressed as many other people I am still a true Gabaldon Fan and love her work.And who knows, mayby she did want a few more dollars in her pocket."
3,?????????,What happened with Diana's comments? I found them interesting and pertinent and now they are gone. I have not bought this book yet because I don't want to even be tempted to reading chapters from the next books. I am planning on buying it after the next book comes out because it will be a good resource when I reread any of the Outlander series. I recommend this series to anyone and will recommend the Companion to people if they promise not to read ahead!
5,Unique book,"This is a remarkable book. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it, in fact. You can read it front to back and it makes wonderful sense, or you can dip into it anywhere and find entertainment and insight! I don't know whether it's fiction or nonfiction (I keep seeing it on different bestseller lists of both kinds, so I guess I'm not the only one), but I think that's very appropriate! The novels have always given me the feeling that everyone and everything in them is totally real, and this book does a wonderful job of maintaining that illusion, even while the author explains it. Masterful!"
1,A complete waste of time,I was very glad that I borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste any money on it. I skimmed through it and found it to be a huge disappointment for a fan of the series. Ms. Gabaldon must think pretty highly of herself to write a whole book about writing the 'Outlander' series or she just wants to cash in on their popularity.
1,Kirkus got it backwards,I like the novels and don't think they are too long. But I feel that this book is a rip off and maybe Gabaldon is getting too big for her britches. It's too much money to pay for stuff I've read in other places.
3,Kindle Version,"I ordered the Kindle version; it is a bit difficult to read due to spacing issues at the larger font, but this is due to the Kindle, not the publisher. So far I have only read Outlander and I wanted the Glossary and Pronunciation chapter. I am certain I will enjoy the entire book as Ms. Gabaldon is a marvelous writer with a `down to earth' style."
3,humor at a price,"I enjoyed the Companion for its humor, but for me, things like character horoscopes brought the integrity of the series down a notch. Nevertheless, avid Outlander fans will most likely enjoy the Companion, especially the footnotes."
4,The Outlandish companion,It was not what I thought it would be after all. I am glad I read it though. It is heplful explaining about how the author came up with the ideas for her novels and etc.. It was also interesting to know what sort of research she did for the novels or series of novels. I loved the photos of the places she went to for the information re:the sights she referred to in the novels. That was also interesting. I was hoping for a continuation of the series that was why I was a little disappointed about the actual book with this title.I would not purchase it again however. I also would not recommend it to anyone to purchase for themselves if they had already read the novels as I had prior to this book.CCL.
3,Only Cover FIRST FOUR novels,"Interesting, but ONLY covers first FOUR novels. Good for review if you haven't read the first four in awhile and just got the 3 others. However, also a ton of info on the world of Outlander, maps, characters, Gaelic language, herbs, etc. Very interesting."
5,Drums of Autumn,A wonderful book as well as the best Romantic Series I've ever read! Mrs. Gabaldon must consider making this into a movie!
3,definately interesting,"I just wanted to say that I liked this book for what it is-a companion to the novels. As a ""die-hard"" fan, I can honestly say that for me it was really neat to find out how the characters developed, and how she had help with Gaelic and the other languages that she knows very little or nothing about. I personally didn't like the horoscopes, but I'm not into that kind of thing. Anyway, if you are looking for an interesting and informative read that can give you some insight into how she does reasearch and other things, then please read this. If you don't like that kind of thing, then don't buy it."
5,Greatest series ever,The series of the Outlander is the best reading that I have read in a long time. I picked up the first book and could not put it down. I have read all 7 books in the series and they were just great. I was disappointed with the last one only because I knew that I will have to wait several years before Diana comes out with the 8th book for me to find out what happened with some of my favorite people in the series.
4,Good Movie,This movie was pretty good. A ton of well known actors. Little short stories in one big movie. Worth watching.
3,"New York, New York!","New York, I love you too-that's why I enjoy seeing places familiar, less and more iconic, used to enhancing a mosaic of events New York-linked characters are somehow interacting involved in."
1,They DON'T,"I was born in NYC, and I live in CA because the weather got too rough for me. I miss NY so much that I am always looking for a good opportunity to see movies about the city. I hated this picture! I could not continue watching, not only because the vocabulary was limited to the characters using curse words to express themselves, but as much I watched, the dialog was puzzling, the people lustful, and I didn't want to waste my time, and submit my ears to fowl language to see how things turned out. I saw no love for NYC!New York, I Love You"
2,It's an ok movie,"The movie is a little out of the ordinary in that it gives snap-shot views of life in NY. A lot of different lifestyles are seen in this movie, which is just like NY. Not very interesting in my opinion."
2,"new york, i think we should just be friends...","after falling in love with the cumulative masterpiece known as ""Paris Je T'aime"" i thought the new york version would be just as amazing....let me tell you this....i couldn't bring myself to watch the entire thing. i just didn't ""get"" the first few shorts. i felt disconnected watching them. not only did i not feel any sort of feeling remotely close to being described as ""love""...i didn't even feel like any of the stories were unique to new york city...they could've taken place anywhere. generic."
1,Wanna be artsy fartsy movie,"One of the most annoying and phony films I have ever seen. How were the stories supposed to be related anyway? I just sat there, waiting for something, anything, interesting to happen. What a waste of time. The dialogue was so fake, and the characters were so flat, and what exactly am I supposed to love about New York in this movie? Nobody in real life speaks this way."
1,garbage,"totally awful, nothing like the light-hearted and touching paris, je taime....really pathetic efforts, can't believe these big names actors bought into this"
1,Is this really considered Jazz?,"Inspite of Karin Krog's wonderful voice, most of the songs drag and just sound weird (especially the ""band""). If one likes very slow and cool jazz that also has some energy, I suggest the following singers with their great back-up musicians: Lee Wiley, June Christy, Blossum Dearie, Chris Connor, Peggy Lee, Chet Baker, Holly Cole, Jeanie Bryson, Helen Merrill, and Kristin Korb."
4,Great musical comedy,"This review is for the Critetion DVD editon of the filmÀ nous la liberté , also known as ""Liberty for Us"" is another very nice film by Rene clair. The film is a satire of life working in a factory.It is about an assembly line worker who falls in love with a secratary who works at the factory. Theare is some slapstick humor in the film and has several scenes where the characters sing. The film is considered a musical as well because of this.The DVD has some great special features.There is an sudio presentation of the plagarism lawsuit against Charlie Chaplin over his film ""Modern Times"". There is also a 1998 video interview with Bronja Clair and two deleted scenes.Finally, Rene Clair's 1924 surrealist film Entr'acte is also on the DVD. It is a short film about a funeral where pepole chase a runaway wagon carrying the casket. Some scenes are played in a very cool slow motion which is better seen than read about.I highly recommend this film!"
5,More enjoyable then expected!,"Had me laughing out loud a few times. Usually not one for musicals i actually purchased this movie because i wanted the short, the extra ""Entr'acte."" The acting is fantastic, all though copied later by chaplin in ""Modern Times"" i enjoyed this movie much more then Chaplin's ""Modern Times,"" the chemistry between Raymond Cordy and Henri Marchand is wonderful!"
1,Beware- Mutilation of a Classic,"This is an abridged version of Clair's 1931 masterpiece, with two key sequences cut, and added to the DVD as ""extras"" in beat up 16mm prints, when original nitrate material is readily available. The two sequences in question are the singing flowers who serenade Emile outside the factory; and Emile's quest for romance in a Parisian cafe. All in all, this is about 10 minutes of material! It is impossible to overstate the effect that the elimination of these two scenes has on the film as a whole; it destroys, in large part, much of the magic of the film.On the plus side, the subtitles are vastly superior to any other version available, and the transfer of the feature (minus the cuts) is superb....but with the cuts, you're really not getting the film. Criterion made a serious error with this one."
5,The best Album I've heard in a long time.....,"This Album had my feet taping long after the songs were finished. It was a nice change from what music has turned into these days, it really took me back."
3,Not a good value,"I like the pictures in these cards and the names are nice and big, however, with so few cards I think this is not worth buying and would not purchase again.The cardboard cards seem sturdy in case an infant chews a little on them. Other than that, not worth the money."
4,Surprisingly Captivating,"Pros:Kept my 7-week-old entertained for 15-20 minutes at a time (when quiet and alert)Patterns and bold lines were stimulating and age-appropriateAllowed my child to express preference (consistent smiling at 1-2 particular cards)Encouraged ""talking""Immediately interesting to babyCons:""Dalmatian"" is spelled incorrectly on both the box and the cardFont on cards is difficult to readOverall:Despite some small criticism, I am very pleased with these cards. They have become part of our daily activities."
5,"Great Toy, Durable","My 9 month old loves these. They're thick so they can take his chewing and slinging them around. I can put him on the floor, hand him a stack of these cards and he will entertain himself. They're awesome!"
4,Babies love these,"I'm happy that I found these cards on Amazon for a grandbaby. When our babies were little, we had simple waterproof pictures with red, white, and black drawings that we set inside their cribs. I was looking for something similar. These art cards are the nearest thing I could find and they are very cute. They can be hung on the wall or set in a crib or you can simply look at them with a baby, while naming the animals. They are sturdy but not waterproof. (Otherwise, I would have given them 5 stars.)"
5,Only have had for three days but love them!,"We ordered these to keep our little man occupied on the changing table. We have only had them for three days but so far they are great. Our 8 month old holds a different card each time and we talk about the pictures. We loved the first set that I went and ordered a second set for more variety! We love them so far!!Update: We still love the cards but the second box wasn't as exciting as the first one. The Original Collection has a cute animals...fish, cat, owl, snail but the black & white collection is odd. It pictures a panda and a penguin so you are fooled the other animals are an anteater, a skunk, a lemur and a Dalmatian. We aren't quite sure what to do with some of the card. Baby still loves them but it is hard to use to engage in a conversation about an anteater....what sound do they make? We still love the cards but would have liked to known what animals were in each pack...I might have gone with something else."
3,Too little for the cost,"The pictures were somewhat interesting to my son, but for the money, there are too few cards in the package."
5,Love these!,Great flash cards. My 2.5-month-old loves them. Turning the cards from black-on-white pictures to white-on-black makes my baby jump with excitement and smile. Keeps baby entertained for quite some time and provides visual stimulation as well as cognitive development.
4,Fun for little one to watch,"I bought these and hung them up as a mobile over my baby's crib. He loves to stare up at them. Not sure if it's because they slowly move, or because they are strong black and white graphics. They are sturdy cardboard that resist baby's drool when he handles them. I like the artwork."
4,Very engaging!,My daughter loves looking at these cards. They have helped with tracking and looking to both sides. She also has hearing loss so now we are signing while using the cards. They are attractive and compact! They would make a great gift too!
3,"Nice, but only 6 cards!",The pictures are interesting but the box comes only with 6 cards. As a minimum one could expect 10 cards at least!
2,"Cute, not worth it.","I ordered these when my daughter was about four months old. They're cute and she liked them for about 15 seconds but that's about it. Now she only occasionally chews on the corners. Nice idea, great drawings, but nothing special and certainly nothing interesting to my little one. Possibly because she was too old. When she was a newborn we printed out a FREE pdf of black and white shapes and images off the internet that she loved and stared at for ages. Just, FYI."
2,"Nice renderings of animals for adults, but too abstract for babies","These must be made to appeal to adults. They certainly appeal to me, I love the way the animals are illustrated, and the woodland theme is so on trend right now for both kids and adults. However they are way to abstract for babies and small toddlers. I got no recognition from either of my kids, no wide eyes, giggles or words as to what animal any given image was. they do look great, and I can see why parents would be drawn to them. But babies really seem to want more realistic or cuddly cartoony images."
3,"Cute Cards, Not for Mobile Use","These cards are definitely cute - loved the illustrations and black and white. We bought these to hang in our nursery with the Wee Gallery mobile but returned them. They were too large & heavy.If you plan to use for wall hanging or flash cards, great but DON'T buy for the mobile use."
3,Pleased but could be Happier,"I bought the ""Jungle themed"" cards for my son who has an animal themed nursery and the original set for a friend's newborn baby. I like how big and sturdy the cards are and the drawings are very creative and fun for even adults to gaze at. The card is black on one side with a white drawing and white on the other side with a black drawing. Each card has the same animal on both sides and on the black side the animal is labeled.I did not rank this item higher because there are only 6 cards in each set which I feel is a small amount. And FYI, in the jungle collection one of the cards is of a bear. Typically we think of bears to be in a forest setting and I was expecting a more exotic animal to be included in a set of only six. There is also a lion, snake, parrot, monkey and zebra.Overall I think they make a very unique and quality product."
2,not worth the money,"Find some hard paper and just draw whatever on it and you will get the same result. Although it won't last as long as this one, it doesn't cost as much as this one neither. I can't say my little one doesn't like it. He just doesn't like it for more than 2 minutes. I mean there is only 6 cards in a set and once I go through this with him, he is not interested for the 2 second round. Maybe when he is older? like, I don't know, old enough to tear book apart? then I still can find paper to draw whatever on them!! so, save the bucks"
2,better cheaper cards out there,"these are cute and ""artsy"" but there are so many options out there! i love the My First Touch and Feel cards so much I regret not buying a few packs of those instead of this one set. they may be cute as a gift but i don't recommend them. cards with color would probably get more miles."
1,Mathew Broderick...in a serious role? What's THAT tell you?,"Wallace Shawn lives down to his declining reputation with this one. The script is so clumsy and psuedo-intellectual that even Julianne Moore seemed to struggle with it. And Mathew Broderick...in a serious role? What's THAT tell you?It's hard to believe the author of the marvelous ""The Designated Mourner"" could've fallen so far."
5,Great sauce,we loved it and would recommend it to anyone. We put it on cream cheese and serve it as an appetizer with crackers
1,disappointed,"At [this price], some might find it worthwhile. But buyer beware - this is a homemade production that gives almost no insight. I was routinely left frustrated as the narrator would take a certain path without the slightest amount of justification or explanation. Most people would be better off installing the OS a couple of times on their own. In short, it's better than nothing, but not a whole lot better."
4,Superb job and suspense,The book starts out a little slow but speeds up after a couple of chapters after their mom gets kidnapped. Most of the suspense is in a wonderland R.V. Park where the two kids meet some friends and explore the shut down park with great anticipation. As the story gets to the last few chapters the kids get chased through the park by a couple of men who kidnapped their mom. Using their skills from exploring the park with their two friends they try to outwit the two men. The author has a lot of suspense through the chase that will keep you reading until the end. Other than a few family problems most people will okay this book. I would recommend this book to the 11-14 year old age group.
4,Scared Stiff,"Scared Stiff is a book by Willo Davis Roberts. It is about two young boys who came home from school one day to find that their mom was missing. Their dad lad left the family a few weeks before this had happened. They report their missing mother to the police detectives, but they quickly discover that the police aren't doing much to find their mother. They decide to find their mom by themselves. Until she comes back home, they have to live with their uncle in an R.V. park. They are given many clues to find their mother, but this isn't an easy task for the boys of their uncle, and it is always a very dangerous thing to do.I love this book very much. It was very suspenseful and didn't give away too many clues. This book had me guessing until the end. It was hard to stop reading it. I got very attached to the characters in the story. This book was very descriptive and gave me many visuals. I could always picture the scenes in the story."
3,Good debut,"This album was Nicolette Larson's first. It contained Neil Young's Lotta Love, a song which became her biggest hit and is still played regularly on easy listening stations. But that album didn't introduce me to her. It was the harmony part she played on an Emmylou Harris album that got me to get this. At times her voice does sounds similar to Emmylou like on two of the best songs of this album the Louvin Brothers' cover ""Angels Rejoiced"" and ""Come Early Mornin'"" . But she had range too. The Kiki Dee like number ""Baby Don't Do It"" shows this. But this does at time sound like a product of the late 70's particularly the keyboard usage on ""You Send Me."" If you like California soft rock scene of the 70's this is good to add to your collection.Linda Ronstadt sings backup to a couple of numbers."
5,Covers every parenting topic,How to avoid raising badly behaved kids? Essie Knuckle and Mittie Glymph's light-hearted Other People's Rotten Kids covers every parenting topic from kids' raging hormones to kids placing the blame on other kids for bad behavior/ Essie and Mittie demonstrates their advice and recommendations with sharp pointed observations mixed with humor noting that the problem of badly behaving children doesn't always lie in the house nextdoor.
2,Wait For Playstation 2 Version,"Did you master Gameday 2000? Well I got pretty good and to my dismay realized that Gameday 2001 is even easier. My first few games of 2001 I absolutely crushed the computer on all difficult settings. The graphics aren't very different, though the music's a bit cooler. All in all, not much has changed ... ."
1,Gameday [stinks] horribly,Gameday [stinks] it always has and it always will now madden on the other hand rocks but its a gameday review so lets start the loading times are unbelivably long and once you finaly get in the game the graphics are a improvment but could be alot better and the jerseys colors are way off and you cant even see the helmets gameplay is bad and the commentary is worse the only good thing about the game is the opening movie(witch put a tear in my eye) also its wway too easy. the only reason you should buy the game is if you are a diehard football fan. buy madden
5,Gameday Beats Madden Hands Down!,"If you want the best NFL football game for your sony Playstation look no futher. The NFL Gameday series has had consistant gameplay and ballance for years now. You ever notice how Madden make running the football too easy one year, and near imposible the next, no consistency in gameplay there! In Gameday though the gameplay rules. Difficulty levels and computer AI are completly adjustable making it easy for players of all levels to find a proper challenge for them. At the intermediate skill level playing 8 minute quarters I often find myself stacking up some very realistic game stats. I will have a quaterback that passes for about 220-250 yards, and run the ball for about 130-150. The ballence of the offensive attack makes this game so much fun! I suggest everyone give NFL Gameday a shot over Madden."
3,Jessica Meets Harry!,"As far as I'm concerned, all the ""Murder She Wrote"" episodes are enjoyable since Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Jessica Fletcher, a mystery writer from Maine, is wonderful and it's fun seeing the old time guest clebrities. Naturally, some stories are better than others and when Jessica teams up with another detective, it doesn't always work. In these two episodes, Jessica meets Harry McGraw, an old ""gumshoe"" in the Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade vein (women are ""dames""). Trouble is, he's a bit of a doofus and keeps getting beat up! Jerry Orbach (more recently seen in the ""Law and Order"" series) is an excellent actor and he and Ms. Lansbury have a good rapport."
2,"Fine individual performances, but sorry I purchased this","I was greatly disappointed in this production of my favorite opera. I found it rather overworked in parts and simply ridiculous in others: e.g., period costumes mixed with bride-of-Frankenstein costumes; Papageno in a duck hat; a pathetically misfired updating of Papagena.I can't fault the voices, orchestra or chorus and especially think Papageno did a fine jo, in spite of the costume that gave him trouble. However, I regret investing in this DVD. I have since seen the Royal Drottingholm Theatre version and find it superior in many ways, even though the sound quality is uneven. I found the Drottingholm enchanting, but the Covent Garden production was so visually cluttered and ill-conceived that it completely detracted from the glorious music and the great voices. Mozart deserves better. And so do opera-lovers."
3,Marvelous performance,"A marvelous performance of perhaps the greatest opera ever written. Damrau is beyond superb as Queen of the Night. Nobody, but nobody, has ever done it better. It deserves five stars but on my computer I cannot do it."
3,"Some Magic, but not enough.","First the great stuff: Diana Damrau is right up there with the very greatest of all the Queens of the Night (Berger, Deutekom, Moser). She is the real thing a true dramatic coloratura Queen of the night with laser sharp high Fs. She is dramatically the best acting Queen I have seen. Next Colin Davis and the orchestra are superb. Simon Keenlyside is a wonderful singing Papageno. The rest of the singers are good to very good but not up there with the best. The sets and costumes are ""safe"" but not really inspired. I expected more from this FLUTE and am a little disappointed. I will return to it for Damrau's Queen of the Night and Colin Davis' conducting."
1,Very disappointing,"When I see an opera on screen it is because I do not only want to appreciate the music but also enjoy the visual interpretation. Listening to this version, the musicians, singers, conductor, chorus, orchestra are all very good to excellent. The costumes, scenery, and and how the performers act on stage I find strange, dark, and not in keeping with the way I understand Mozart. Even though it could be said that Die Zauberflote is a philosophical theme, I do not see it as a dark piece as this version portrays. My previous experiences of Die Zauberflote on the screen were the Swedish film version and the Metropolitan Opera version, which I liked much better. In the end it depends on one's perception of Mozart's Zauberfloete how a particular version is liked."
1,Be aware of Disney!,Try to imagine the mix of Disney and Mozart.Do you feel it under your skin?I respect Disney productions; they are very spectacular. But I do not see Mikeys and little Mermaids all around me every day. I would give this DVD away (watched it one time and will hardly watch it again) if someone wants to pay for the shipping.
4,"Great Performance, terrible subtitles","All of the performers are fantastic and the production itself is great. There are times where the subtitles leave out key phrases, even a few arias that have only one or two lines of subtitles for the entire aria (and even those seem randomly chosen). I don't usually write reviews, but I think that if you don't already know the opera the subtitle things might make it difficult to follow. If you know the opera, this is a great production to own."
4,Great Opera :),This was actually a gift and they tell me it's amazing but the only problem is the english subs are rather badly done.
5,"""O Zittre Nicht""","Diana Damrau sings the best ""O Zittre Nicht"" one is ever going to hear. The coloratura run at the end is just flawless. Her ""Der Holle Rache Kocht in Meinem Herzen"" ain't too shabby either."
5,You will be spoiled for any other rendition of Magic Flute...,"There is a clever juxtaposition of avant garde staging/theatrical setting with period subject material. The Queen of the Night is downright hot, not to mention the 3 maids. Pappageno stole the ovation! Although a small part, Pappagena is delightful. Regrettably, I don't know what to say about Tamino and Pamina but I'm sure they were great.The singing is superbly articulate and the acting is second to none. Not just standing there singing with cheap backdrops! The orchestra is strong and the chorus powerful. The sets are meticulously done, eye catching but not distracting. The fire and water sequence is very creative. Its quite a production. Be sure to watch the ovations after it ends. The accolades are appropriately given to those who deserve them the most. Try it and you'll love it."
3,Useful info about field instruments,"Chapter 7 - Safety in the field instruments and devices is quite good-written including a couple of practical tips. However, the parts about hazard assessment (FAR) etc. seem to be unnecessary have no connection to the rest of the book."
3,Could stand a rewrite,This book would benefit greatly from a rewrite. It is often difficult to follow the authors' logic. I get the impression that this book was rushed to print. A simple example of this is the fact that all the left-hand pages are incorrectly indented so that they run into the binding of the book. Please adjust your publishing software!
3,Not particularly effective,"After having learned a lot from ""Effective Java"" I was pleased to see a new book with a similar theme on C#. While there is a lot of interesting information in this book, it pales significantly in comparison to Effective Java.I was hoping to learn idiomatic C# with lots of tips and techniques and I found I learned more about the low-level technical details of the language. Frankly, if you are spending a lot of time worrying about the performance of boxing/unboxing I think you could better spend it on other design problems."
2,Very informative but hampered by errors,"I found alot of very valuable information in this book in advanced topics as well as a good review of basic C# and CLR topics.Numerous typos, one every few pages, including the chapter heading for Item 8, were distracting. Some obvious factual errors, like page 63 and page 65 contradicting each other, made me question the accuracy all the content."
4,Effective C#: Not as complete as the other Effective series,"This book is helpful in some respects for developing some insights into C#, but it is a bit disappointing. It is not up to the caliber of Effective C++, More Effective C++, or Effective Java.I think that the problem is that it delves into .NET more than into the innards of the language itself. It would be nice if a follow up volume will head deeper into the language constructs and the CLR.An additional problem surfaced in the first printing that I received. Almost every page has sentences where words run together. It is a shame that a proofreader did not catch such an obvious problem. It is well below the standards I have come to expect from Addison-Wesley. It is my hope that this problem will be (or has been) addressed.Otherwise, I consider it a good general .NET book."
5,Thought provoking book on using C# and .NET,"If you have just learned the C# syntax, then this book is for you. This book is also good for the veterans out there as well - including VB.NET folks. Even though I have looked at .NET since the beginning, the text forced me to reconsider some of my practices. It's essay style makes for quick reading and also as a reference. You might not agree with Bill's position on every principle - but it will get you to think about the related issues. And you'll get plenty of background into .NET with every explanation of his recommendations.I've seen some mention about printing issues and I haven't seen any issues like that in my copy.I highly recommend this book."
4,good snapshot of current best practices,"This is a good snapshot of best practices as of .NET 1.1. I think it's a must have for any C# developer. Since C# is a relatively new language still, you are likely to be working on new projects and it is better to get the fundamental design right the first time. This book can help with that.The author is careful to mention that the list of recommendations comes not only from his own experiences but also that of other C# experts and consultants. Each effective item is backed up with reasons for the recommendation, with a strong focus on maximizing performance (e.g., preference for foreach constructs, and minimizing boxing/unboxing).I would have liked to have seen some material that stretched beyond the C# language itself though. For example, some practical items related to .NET application configuration, deployment, and solution/project organization."
3,Good information and bad english,"I found this book to contain very useful technical information. I dropped it to three stars because the spelling and grammar are so bad that they interfere with reading the book. This book is peppered with pairs of words not separated by a blank, with partial sentences that are obvious bad edits, and with several unreadable sentences. When the reader has to stop to figure out what the text is badly trying to say, the result is a break in the flow of the book."
3,Could be better,"Some of these glowing reviews are a bit misleading. Effective C# is a decent book, but not great. This book covers much of the same material as Jeffrey Richter's ""CLR via C#"", but in a different format and without the same amount of depth or clarity.Effective C# is not a bad book, and I probably would have given it 4 stars had I not read ""CLR via C#"". In short, pass on this one and get Richter's book."
5,Christine McGuire Has Done It Again,"Christine Maguire, author of the Kathryn MacKay novels, has done it again. With PART III to the MacKay series, Maguire uncovers the affects of HIV on society. And she does this without losing reality for even a minute.Kathryn MacKay, is about to prosecute Richard Hudson, a man, infected with HIV. He is accused of attempted second degree murder by way of infecting (intentionally) three women with the virus.As the prosecution carries on, a series of bombings are happening and Kathryn must solve both cases, before anything gets out of hand... EVEN MORE....PART IV is already in the works... STAY TUNED!"
2,Pipedream Fantasy,"Joseph Vranich presents a glowing, glossy image of a New America linked together with a web of high speed, high tech, high cost SuperTrains. Unfortunately his largely anecdotal story telling has little serious thought regarding the fundamental reason why high speed rail has a very limited future in the United States. There is a reason why Europe has trains and America has planes. Europe is smaller than America. The distances are shorter. Not only does this make a tremendous difference in travel times but it also makes a huge difference in cost. Vranich completely avoids the cost issue.Not a detail.Each mile of track for one of his supertrains costs between $30 and $50 million. Who is going to pay for his 1000 mile network. He doesn't say.This is a significant oversight.Basically, SuperTrains is an excercise in nostalgic dreaming. A very nice one, with lots of nice images. But it is a very foolish book."
5,The Shortest Day,"Excellent explanation for children of the historical importance of the winter solstice, and a good alternative to the preponderance of books celebrating only the Christian perspective on winter holidays....ie, Christmas."
2,shortest day falls short,"Lovely illustraions, but NOT for children ages 4-6 years old. The text could have been so much better. I took it to my children's Montessori school and used selective parts to read to the children...when I ordered it I was hoping to read the entire book."
3,Could have been better,"This book has lovely illustrations, but the text and content could have been so much better. It says for ages 4-8, but really I wouldn't recommend it for anyone over 6. It is pretty simplistic, and won't hold the attention of a child much older than that. I wish it had included a lot more detail about the history of the Solstice."
3,Not all that great,"This is a decent black metal album but not a great one. Darkthrone's next offering ""Under A Funeral Moon"" was far superior in capturing a black metal sound and atmosphere. Most of the tracks on this are pretty good except for the spoken word parts in some of the songs which just sound downright laughable and totally out of place.This album showcases a Darkthrone that hasn't yet fully switched into a mid paced black metal and still clings a bit to the older faster/heavier sound. This is glaringly apparent on tracks like ""Where Cold Winds Blow"" which is extremely fast and almost death metal sounding at times. This isn't a bad thing, it's just that this album shows a Darkthrone that hadn't truly found their niche or their sound just yet. Face it, most folks that own this probably have been in the scene for a while so this is nothing new, but if you're new to this style I suggest ""Under a Funeral Moon"" instead since in my opinion it is a far better Black Metal record."
2,"Evil? maybe, good metal? No","I have always liked good music first and image/politics second. I picked this up trying to fill in my collection of early bands that are credited with founding a genre. Along with Bathory, Mayhem and Burzum which I like most of their early recordings, this album did nothing for me. Cliche sound and riffs, uninspiring and just boring. If you like the genre, then you probably won't care, but if you are looking to find out where early Black Metal comes from - look elsewhere. These guys should stick to their politics and leave the music to musicians. Imitation is not always the best form of flattery. -Rock on!"
5,A Classic Black Metal Album,"I must say that when I first listened to this CD way back in 1991 I was surprised at how much Darkthrone had changed....Not that I was complaining though. After releasing a fantastic debut album ""Soulside Journey"" in 1990 which is one of my all time favorite death metal albums of all time, I was expecting ""A Blaze..."" to sound something like it, but I was wrong.Bathory has a big influence on this band which you hear on this CD, with it's fast pounding drums, and wicked riffs. This album must be added any Black Metal collection and a must for Bathory fans....Definitely a legendary Black Metal release....Hail Darkthrone!"
5,True Black Metal!,"This the far best DarkThrone release, on the later releases they have always seemed to be trying to do music like is on this one.The guys in DarkThrone have never done music with the same atmosphere like this one. the vocals are very diffrent on this album couse it's more screams and a lot rawer and heavier than on later releases. The drums are also very diffrent couse it's more complicated and diverse but on the later albums the drums are pretty much just the same the whole song. so in every way this is the blackest metal release in history. buy now"
5,True Unholy Black Metal,"Forget those poser bands such as Cradle OF Filth and My Dying Bride. Dark Throne (and other great overseas black metal bands)were the first to create that dark, vile sound in virtually every moment they play. This album is one their earliest releases and is awesome. BUY NOW!!!"
3,"Influential, that's all I'll say","Darkthrone is a very influential band, but that doen't translate into quality, per se. The production was paper thin and atonal. In other words, it was boring because of the bad production. I burned a copy of BITNS, and was expecting a good black metal (BM) album. I was expecting a bit more, like some good, tight, machine gun riffage, or some entrancing melody, even. Not to say it's totally bad. It just isn't that great. But if you buy this album expecting an outstanding BM album, you will be disappointed, in my humble opinion.BITNS isn't exactly garbage; it has potential. It's just that Darkthrone have taken the whole ""bad production"" thing to ridiculous extremes. I can't take this music seriously when it just sounds like radio static coming out of my boombox. Under a Funeral Moon is so much better than BITNS."
3,it gets cold in New York,I suspect the niave earnest of this film would have New Yorkers who know about down and out on the streets clutching their ribs with laughter. That said there are enough elements of professional drama to make up for it and I liked the music when it occured. In all an entertaining film that nonetheless serves as a reminder how hard life can be at the bottom of the pyramid in this modern western.country.
4,this is not about the american dream,"this film is more about the intricacies of human nature (than the american dream) which shaped through particular experiences also has the potential to be shaped again. a young thug masquerading as the son of an illegal immigrant dishwasher who though old still pines for his love back home. the real son deprived of his identification forced to endure the brutalities of the dark/seamy side of the city. this movie is about how this particular situation changes all the people caught up in it. the thug is stricken by remorse and conscience about having to gyp the old man. the old man initially suspicious and reluctant to accept his ""son"" slowly warms up to the boy. the real son though innocent is forced to reconcile with the brutalities of the street and adapt himself to the situation. brisk, compelling, brutal ... and tragic."
2,1988 Olympic Volleyball ?,"If you really want to see volleyball, don't buy this video. We bought this video expecting to see complete footage of some of the best volleyball games played in Seoul in 1988, hoping it would show at least as much as was televised that year. To our great disappointment, this video is basically just a highlights video with some extra fluff thrown in. The only volleyball you see is the last 60 seconds or so of all the major games played. All told, you get maybe 20 minutes of volleyball. Definitely not worth the selling price of the video!"
4,"No nonsense, beautiful Requiem","...ok, maybe I'm biased...Joyce Barker (soprano soloist) was my voice coach...(you can also hear her on the Horenstein Mahler's 8th) but the entire recording is of a VERY high standard, and much better than some of the hyped recordings of Verdi's requiem...by the way...you can also get the COMPLETE recording for a steal of a price on the Ulitma label at traditional retailers...THIS IS A TERRIFIC REQUIEM !"
5,An American Noir Classic,"Night Moves stands with The Maltese Falcon, Chinatown and L.A. Confidential as one of the finest American detective movies ever made. Superb performances (including a startling debut by the then 14-year-old Melanie Griffth); a first-rate, genre-aware script and a worthy, resonant ending. The opening third of the movie is a directorial tour-de-force, as the key plot elements are set up in scenes which mesh with the score and each other like verses and chorus of a song. Highly recommended."
4,Definitely an overlooked movie...,"This movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise, but it took a few watches for me to get to feel that way. Gene Hackman plays a private eye who is under utilized in his career (he plays an ex-Oakland Raider in the movie) and is also in the middle of discovering that his marriage is falling apart. (I thought it was interesting how Hackman used his private eye skills to spy on his wife while she was cheating on him.) Hackman's character accepts a seemingly open and shut runaway case (to bring home Melanie Griffith's character) that is nowhere near as simple as it seems. The plot line takes so many twists and turns it does get confusing, but it never gets boring. Overall, I thought Gene Hackman did a great job in this movie, and there were also good performances from the supporting cast. It was fun to see Melanie Griffith and James Woods so early in their careers too. The DVD was worth buying and also has footage on the making of the film."
5,Watch it again,Excellent movie. I watched it a few times. One of the best of its kind. Great music. Very satisfying finale!
4,Not bad,"Gene Hackman plays a private detective, the only exciting work he can find after a pro-football career. His hum-drum marriage speaks of the boredom and a not-so-secret affair surfaces without much to-do.The case he has taken is a mystery and promises to be everything but boring. A wealthy B movie star wants Hackman to find her run-away daughter (Melanie Griffith).Movie people are where Hackman starts the search; actors, stuntmen, and a director. The search leads to the Florida Keys, more mysteries, and pristine ocean waters shot through the lens of a scuba camera.The flick is entertaining, the women gorgeous, and the mystery too deep for the viewer to solve until the very end. Then, sadly, it is too late."
3,Starts off stong then goes off the deep end,"Gene Hackman puts on a great performance in the 1975 Movie ""Night Moves"". Hackman is private eye Harry Moseby , a man in a mid-life crisis who's wife (Susan Clark ) is bored with the marriage, and take on a job finding a missing 16 year old girl .The first half of the movie is so good that I was expecting a masterwork from Director Arthur Penn . But the story and the plot get so busy and forced, that it looked like they threw too much in to the ending. This is no ""Chinatown"" as allot of reviews state, It is A Great movie gone wrong with some great acting from Hackman and Clark ."
2,Not Worth The Trouble Harry...,"Man did I want to like this movie.Hackman is the best and the possibility of finding a mid-70s Gem was really tantalizing, but...this film is really, really mediocre.First we have sub-plot city going on, bad mid life crisis stuff with Susan Clark and Hackman ""Trying to communicate"" about their failing relationship. It's tough on Hackmans character ""Harry"" see 'cause he used to be an NFL player and now he's reduced to being a private eye, she hates it, he does not want to give it up and everyone concerned gets a bad speech.Don't get me wrong, this is no ""MegaForce"", where the film is so bad it becomes campy and actually enjoyable.This is just...mediocre. Buy ""Harper"" with Paul Newman instead."
4,Great night bra for nursing,"This sleep bra has saved me when I have needed to nurse through the night. It is very comfortable and the sides are easily moveable when I am half-awake prepping to nurse my son. The fabric stains easily, but that is a small negative since the bra is for nighttime use only. Great buy and it shipped quickly!"
4,"Very comfortable, easy access","Comfortable bra, easy to nurse in. Does not hold nursing pads in place overnight as well as other bras (e.g., sports bras), but the comfort-for-support trade-off is unavoidable. Washes well--I have two, so they are machine washed and dried every other day and have held up well for nearly 4 months. Would recommend it."
3,runs small,"This is very convenient for night feeding, but runs small compared to the size chart, in my experience. I wouldn't wear it out of the house, since it is very thing fabric and doesn't provide a lot of support."
3,Does its job,"Like others have mentioned the material is pretty thin, but it gives light support and holds breast pads in place."
2,uncomfortable and small,These bras must run small. I have other sleep bras in a large and they fit perfectly. This one in a large is tight and rides up my back. I hate it and should of returned it before I thought I should wear it longer and get used to it.
5,Sooooo convinient...,"The material is thin and breathable. It stretches enough so that even when I went up to a D cup, it still fit (ordered a large). It was very helpful during night time feedings. I wish I ordered more."
3,Order 1-2 sizes bigger,"Comfortable yes, good for sleeping/nursing in middle of night. Seems short when I put it on- it kind of rides up in the back. I would have gotten another size up from the size up I ordered."
1,UGH! What is up with the fit!,"I absolutely love the bra for the comfort, and support that it gives. Love that it is light and soft, but.....what is wrong with the size? I'm usually always a small....to small. Bought medium...to small. Bought large still no difference at all Except for the fact that the cup is bigger which I do not need. It rides up so bad that its under my armpits and the racer back is clear up to my neck. Highly disappointed that I spent money on 3 different sizes and yet I still can not wear them. I really want to try an XL but why throw more money away!"
2,Rides up in the back,I bought 2 Motherhood nursing sleep bras and 2 Medela bras. The Motherhood bras are great. They fit perfect and provide good support. The bra is easy to move out of the way to nurse. I wear them around the house all day and at night. The Medela bras ride up in the back and do not feel as comfortable as the Motherhood bras. I recommend you buy 3 or 4 Motherhood nursing sleep bras because you will need them.
4,Nursing bra,Every other nursing bra I have had felt like it was cutting into me. This bra may not be the most supportive but it is truly great to sleep in. It is very comfortable and easy to move aside for those late night half asleep feedings.
1,Too small and scratchy.,I ordered an XL and it is too small. Haven't delivered my litle one yet so I know it definitely won't fit when it's time for my milk to come in. The band is very itchy and uncomfortable!
3,Just OK.,"The bra isn't very comfortable but gets the job done. Look at the sizing chart someone added and if you're on the bigger side for each size go up a size. I'm a 34DD and I got the medium because typically I am always a medium and it is too small. I also don't think the cotton that they use is very soft. My fear is if I go up to the large size that it will be too big for me. It's hard when you can't try it on for size. For the money, I don't think it is worth it."
2,small,"I am small chested and based on the size chart for this particular nursing bra, I ordered Small. Its really small (even for a current full 32B). The back doesn't fit well and goes way up due to how tight it is. I had to return it."
2,Runs 3 sizes small!,"If you want to be able to wash and dry this, order 2 to 3 sizes up from the medela size chart! It's very flimsy and a single layer. I went with a similar style from A pea in the pod. Yes, it's more expensive, but the front is a double layer and it's made from soft modal. In the pea in the pod one I had to get one size up from their suggestion. Well worth it!This style of bra I would NOT recommend for big breasted women. I'm 5'4"" 142lbs (all baby bump), a 36 B and a half and 9 months pregnant. Can't imagine I'll grow too much bigger once my milk comes in, but for now the Pea in the Pod bra in M works great!"
3,"functional, not glamorous, item","These sleep bras basically served the single purpose of holding in breast pads at night while you slept. I wore them for two years while nursing two different babies, so I owned several of them. Nothing cute about them, but they were just fine and comfortable. Before I bought these I slept in my nursing bras, and I finally realized that was miserably uncomfotable so was happy to have found these."
2,Poor quality product,"This bra does not hold its shape and becomes fairly uncomfortable after only a few washes, with the racerback pulling your shoulders in. Perhaps buying a size up would fix the problem, but that means having to purchase two bras for the use of one, which as far as I'm concerned is not worth it. If you're looking for a great nursing sleep bra, splurge a little and get something like the Belabumbum, which is much better quality and fit."
4,ahh very nice,Just what i needed for sleeping in and lounging around the house. I wish the fabric was a bit thicker but still a good product for the price.
3,Very thin!,This serves the purpose to a point however it is very thin and doesn't have much to hold anything up. It does keep nursing pads in place if that's all you are looking for.
3,Medela sleep bra,"This bra is not what you want. Yes, it is cotton, but the fabric is not dense enough. The bottom elastic band is not wide enough, and got stretched on day one. I think you'll be better off if you buy a 2-pack of nursing bras at Target for around $22. They are much better quality and provide a better support."
4,comfortable but pricey for what it is,"Better than the Lamaze nursing bra. It is very comfortable, but make sure you get a larger size, as they run small."
4,good for large-breasted women,"I just wanted to offer the opinion of someone with a large chest- I am normally a 36DD and am probably a cup size at least larger than that right now while nursing- but otherwise fairly slender- I wear a size 4 or 6 in clothes- so I was worried about ordering a large because I thought the band around the bottom might be too loose. However- the large size fit well. This is the first nursing sleep bra that I am not spilling out of completely. I also purchased one made by motherhood maternity and would not recommend that one for women with larger busts because the front hardly has any elastic at all, and so my breasts fall out any time I bend a little bit. However, just one thing about this Medela bra I don't like- the material is a little thin...I have been wearing it very frequently (3x per week about) and think it might be worn out within a couple of months. Overall, I would definitely recommend it or buy one again if/when this one wears out."
3,Really small for a large!,"I'm a 36C and in my second trimester and ordered this to keep nursing pads in at night. I'm an average-sized woman and the large size is almost too small. I know there's no way I'll be able to wear this once my milk comes in. Is comfortable enough for now, and OK to sleep in, but the chest band was pretty itchy the first few times and I think it could be designed to be bigger and with softer materials."
1,Does Not Fit Correctly,"I bought this bra from a chain baby store and followed the chart on back to get the correct size, which for me was a Medium; 34C. This bra's elastic is not strong enough to stay firmly around my body. For some reason it always slides up when I wear it so the bottom of the bra ends up sitting across my nipples - not very comfortable to wake up to. I think this is a case of a poorly designed bra with not enough elastic, or they mislabeled the size chart on the back. Do not get this bra if you are thinking about it. Madela makes one that resembles a sports bra and clips at the shoulder and is made of a super stretchy material (it is far more comfortable and it works fine for sleeping and nursing). If you decide to buy this bra and are on the borderline between sizes, go with the larger size."
5,Love it,Highly reccoment this nursing bra!!! Ultra light weight and extreamly comfortable! I wear it as often as i can! Well worth the money!
3,Eh... It's ok,"After receiving it, I can say I much prefer the motherhood sleep bras over this one. This is really really thin and the sizes are misleading. According to the size chart, I should have gotten a medium. I got a large and it's still too small."
3,runs small,"I ordered a medium- I am a 34C. I can still wear it, but it is very snug- should have gotten a size large as it appears they run pretty small."
3,I WANT to love these!,These bras are very very comfortable but the elastic wears out quickly. Definitely not a long-term use product and by long-term I mean more than a month.
4,Works great!,"I bought this bra solely for sleeping, because the idea of multiple hooks and clasps didn't seem all that conducive to sleeping. It's very lightweight, easy to get on, and holds nursing pads in place just fine. With my nipples being so sore, I've even been wearing it out of the house. But, it IS December, so I might not if I wasn't already covered up so much. Very inexpensive compared to other bras I've purchased, too! My local store just informed me that they are discontinuing them, which is a bummer."
3,just okay,"Nice light fabric for summer, but find it's too short, it rides up in back. I'm tall, thin and only a nursing C cup."
3,"Not as good as I thought it would be, but still nice.","They can be comfortable, but a few times it kind of ""rides"" back there, which was mildly annoying. I recommend it, but not on smaller breasted women."
1,It might as well be made out of tissue paper..,Support? What support? I have tank-tops that hold up my breasts better than this thing. You buy Mandela because it is a trusted brand but this thing is cheap and flimsy as can be.
2,Cheap!,"I went from a 34DD to now a 34F during pregnancy and this bra fits okay for wearing around the home and getting a rest from underwires. However, this bra is cheaply made. After the first time I washed it, the threads at the bottom started pulling out and even though I cut it where it was shredding, the threads continue to pull off so this is definitely not going to hold up for long term use."
1,Shrinks a lot,I liked this item when I first got it. I washed it and it worked ok for a sleeper. Especially when my son woke up in the middle of the night and demanded food that instant it was fast and easy to feed him. After washing a couple times I noticed the bra continued to shrink. It's stopped shrinking but now I almost don't fit this one. I left one unwashed and compared it to the washed ones and it's shrunk about an inch all around. Not happy with this item.
1,runs WAY small,i am not very large chested but had to go up TWO sizes and it was still a bit snug and uncomfortable. returned item for that reason. purchase the Coobie or Motherhood Maternity instead and you wil get a much better product.
2,No support for full figured,"I ordered the size suggested, but I have to say, if you think you need the large, don't buy it unless you are very pert - it doesn't provide any support and you tend to fall out all over."
1,THE WORST NURSING BRA EVER !,"DON'T REPEAT MY MISTAKE !!! DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT !My size is currently M. However, I had read some reviews and a lot of reviewers complained that the size on this bra runs very small. Thus, just in case, I ordered a Large one and it barely fits - sic! It rides up in the back. An extra large would have been better - but as I have mentioned, my size is M ! I wanted to exchange it for XL. Thus I wrote to SET 4 Baby Customer Service. The answer was that I can return it but the refund will be less $3.99. Moreover, you have to pay for the shipping. Thus I just put it to the trash. IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY ! Don't buy it."
1,never received item,"The address I gave Amazon was apparently not one that I could receive a package. I have a PO box for USPS, but receive UPS or FedEx at my physica address. However, upon entering my address, was not alerted by Amazon to give the appropriate address according to that info. Therefore, I didn't receive the product for a couple of weeks. The seller did finally contact me by phone message to say that they needed another address because it was shipped back to them. I called back, giving them both addresses and after a week or so, received an email stating that my money would be refunded. I feel they needed to make further attempts, but am not sure why I never received it. I ended up having to go into ""the city"" (an hour away), to purchase this much-needed item."
3,"Nice, but runs a bit small","This is what I expected, but I ordered a Large and it isn't big enough. (So, for anyone looking for advice, I was a 36C prior to pregnancy and now (with a 6 week old) guess I'm something around a DD or E, I'm not sure - but I'd suggest going up a size from what you think you may need.)Other than that, it's a great sleep / nursing bra - I love that it's got such easy access for the baby!"
3,ok bra,"I bought both this bra and the La Leche League bra at the same time because they were close in price. This Medela bra does not have the amount of support that the La Leche League bra has. The fabric is also thinner. Be sure to look at the sizing chart. I was a medium in this bra, but a large in the La Leche League bra. This bra is ok and I will continue to use it because I have it, but I will be buying more of he La Leche League bras instead of this one."
4,Very Comfortable but Very Thin!,This is a good sleep bra for a smaller chested woman. It does not provide a whole lot of support. The fabric is very thin but it is VERY comfortable and soft.
3,Medela Sleep Bra elastic tore,"I like the product it is very confortable to sleep, but the first time wash it the elastic tore, so i feel disappointed with the product."
3,Runs small,"Got this in a medium to sleep in. Im only 5'4, 120lb, but this felt small to me, it kept riding up. Wish I would have gotten a large."
4,"A decent, comfortable nursing bra!","It is well made and is relatively cute, although in order to find a cup size that would fit I bought the XL which makes the back of the bra travel high on my back. I am wearing a 36DD right now, but am afraid the Large would not have given me enough coverage. I like though that everything stays in place while I sleep and it feels like I'm wearing nothing. I also have bought the Lamaze sleeping bra which I also like and it fits better and actually is cuter while wearing, but things pop out while you're sleeping, so I haven't found the ""perfect"" sleeping bra yet."
2,Eh.....not great,"Very soft, but fabric is too thin. It also creeps up in the back. Amamante makes a much better nursing slumber bra."
2,Uncomfortable seams,"I wanted a nice cotton sleep bra and read good reviews about the Medela sleep bra before purchasing it. When I tried it on, it provided okay support. However, sleeping in it is another thing altogether. It is not very comfortable due to the thick seams at the shoulders and in the band under the bra - all of which left red marks the following morning. The next time I wore it, I turned it inside out. It is more comfortable wearing it inside out, but I shouldn't have to do this just to feel more comfortable! If Medela would change the design to a more comfortable bra, then it would be much better."
3,Fit issues,"I gave this 3 stars because I like it for sleeping in, but I am a very small person and even on my small frame it seems to ride up really bad on me as if the shoulder straps aren't long enough (I generally keep my bra straps on the tightest settings so beware if you don't!). I originally got a medium and then bought a large later on, but even the large was too tight over the shoulder. Other than that it works great. I will say I usually pull the whole thing up over my boob rather than try to pull the cup down and keep it there. Overall, comfy and cheap."
2,Too small!,"I think this would be okay if you're pretty small-chested, but if you are, you probably don't need a bra to lounge around in. I ordered the size indicated for me on the chart, but it's too small - the back rides up and there's almost no support for the girls. Just say no if you're larger than a C-cup."
2,bad fit,"i even went up a size, hoping for something that would fit well. this isn't it. it's rather small. i would suggest ordering maybe two sizes up."
4,"Love the product, but quality of materials leaves some to be desired","I am happy with this bra, in fact, I purchased another one after having the first one for a few weeks. I wear a C/D cup size; I ordered the large and it fits perfectly. It is not intended to provide support, however, I am much happier with the support it does provide when compared to a similar style sleep bra made by a popular maternity store brand. My only complaint is the quality of the elastic at the bottom of the bra. I had read many reviews prior to purchasing about the elastic unraveling. It did happen when I naively tossed it in with my other clothes (I always hung to dry, though). I still wear the bra - just snipped off the dangling threads. The unraveling did not seem to effect the strength of the elastic. For my second bra however, I have washed it in a lingerie laundry bag, and it has not unraveled yet. So, all in all, great, comfortable bra, but beware of laundering!"
2,Not enough support even for small women,This bra has very wimpy elastic around the rib cage so that it easily rides up. The fabric is too thin so you can see through even when wearing a regular top over it.
3,Sizes seem to run small,"I am currently pregnant, and I figured that a medium would be a good size to get because I wear a 36B in regular bras. Well, the medium is quite small...it fits okay under the bust, but there wouldn't be much room at all to grow, and I highly doubt it will fit comfortably when my milk comes in after the baby. It's pretty comfortable, I would just recommend getting a bigger size."
2,too small,"This is much smaller than the size charts state. Save your money and by these from Target, much softer and with more stretch."
2,Returning...,"Like some other reviewers have said, the fabric of this bra is extremely thin, and the way the elastic band around the bottom attaches makes me think it wouldn't last very long before getting holes along the seem line. It seems very cheaply made. Also, the sizing seems off. I ordered a large, which should have fit by the sizing chart on the back of the package, but it seemed a little small. Final complaint is that it was a bit too short for me, the elastic being pulled up at the shoulders rather than sitting straight and secure around the bottom, as though the straps are too short. Overall, it just felt a flimsy and thin. I'll be returning it."
3,Not true to size,I have long looked for a comfortable/leisure bra and thought I'd finally found it. Alas it wasn't meant to be. Although comfortable in all aspects; it was not true to size. The cup size was small. My bra size is true and this bra was smaller for the listed size. I'll pass it on to my sister in law who is larger around but a smaller cup size and see if she can wear it.
4,"Comfy, but size up!","I am a 34C and ordered a small, according to the measurements on the package. While it fits (barely), I would definitely order a larger size if you are on the edge of two sizes. The bra is comfortable and perfect for sleeping or lounging around the house."
3,fair quality for this medela product,"this bra is not very supportive, and is made of really thin material. It also runs really small for it's size."
2,Agreed: Really Small for a Large,"I ordered a large after I decided the medium wasn't big enough -- and frankly, the medium and large are not very different in size. I'm contemplating trying an extra large. But I'm not sure. The elastic band that goes around my ribcage seems very tight (and I generally wear a 36). Bummer. Finding comfortable bras... Otherwise, the $14 price and the stretchy, light fabric are the upside of this bra."
4,A simple nursing bra,"Sizing runs small, I am a 34C and currently am wearing nursing pads(not thick) around the clock. I wish I would of gotten a size L, rather than M. But it is still a comfortable and simple nursing bra. Just what I was looking for."
4,Very Comfortable and Easy!,I wish I could wear this sleeping bra all day long! It's so comfortable and easy to maneuver during middle of the night feedings. Would recommend!
2,Not for larger chests,"I was a 32DD before baby and this nursingbra does not fit at all. Don't waste yourmoney if you have a larger bust and a smallrib cage. It is not comfortable at all,causes boob pillows and rides up in the back."
5,best sleep bra there is,This is my fav. sleep nursing bra and since I am small chested I also wore this around the town. I highly recommend this.
2,Runs Small,"This is a really simple bra, but it runs very small - I was a 36C b/f pregnancy and a 38D during; I ordered a large and found it uncomfortable."
4,convenient for night feedings,"good sleeping bra. Order 1 or two sizes larger, runs very small. I am 34C and ordered Large."
5,super comfortable,"I bought two of these because they were so comfortable to wear, at night and during the day. I am normally a B cup, larger when nursing, but I felt like this offered enough support all day and was great to wear to bed. For larger cup sizes, you might need more support during the day. For some button up shirts I wore a regular nursing bra so the buttons didn't pull too much with my larger size."
2,runs small better products available,"I am not a large person. I normally wear extra small or small; however, the small was too small. If you order this item order a size larger than you think you need. The lamaze cotton spandex sleep bra for nursing and maternity is comparable price to the medela sleep bra and a much better product. In the end, if you are only going to get one nursing bra I recommend the bravado silk seamless nursing bra over both of these products. While the bravado is more expensive it is also a much better product."
2,didnt come in right size,I received item on time but when I had ordered product it gave options of sizes to choose from. I chose medium and received extra large
3,Smaller than expected,"I am a fairly petite woman. I ordered a small and I found that this definitely runs much smaller than I anticipated. I have not yet had a chance to try it out, but I think it will be an okay sleep bra and hopefully it still fits when the time comes."
1,"not impressed, runs very small","This felt very, very cheap and was really tight and small. I'm normally a 36B/C cup and the medium felt super-tight and rode up in the back. I can't imagine sleeping in this or wearing around the house. The elastic was also a bit scratchy. This is a simple bra and it just isn't worth the cheap price. There are better options out there!"
4,very good,i like the quality and serviceresonable pricesthe fit is perfecti like this product very much and i ordered for the second one.
3,Comfortable but loses support,"I bought a pair of these and wear them almost nightly for the past 3 months.at first they were great, comfortable to sleep in, now, three month later the bras have lost almost all elasticity. The fabric is wearing very thin. And one of them has a loose thread that is unraveling the band. They are washed on delicate with other bras and have not held up. For the price I guess I could just keep buying new ones but I'd like to find a product that will last."
3,Not for big boobies,I don't think this bra gives my boobies enough support. I found that a regular non-underwire bra (like a sports bra-type) works a LOT better and is just as easy to pull down and nurse.
2,Three weeks in use and coming apart,"This bra is a waste of money. It is nothing special - yes, can be pulled away for feeding, but so can many other bras. It is a thin material which would be nice for these hot summer nights, except that after a few washes the trimming is already coming off. I doubt the bra will survive more than two months - a rather costly investment for such a short time. Would not buy it again."
2,Does not fit well,"I was a 36D before getting pregnant and I ordered an XL because I wasn't sure how much larger I would get when my milk came in. Apparently I got too large! This bra rides up in the back, and when I pull it to the side to nurse it digs into my breast. It was nice and comfy before I gave birth, and I'm sure it would work for someone of a smaller size, but it is not made for larger women!"
4,Very comfortable Sleep Bra,I really like this bra because it is so comfortable and simple. The fabric is very soft and there aren't any scratchy tags or lace trimmings. It washes very well. Sizing seems to be a bit on the tight side; so I would suggest buying the next size up if you find yourself in between sizes on their sizing chart like I was.
2,Pretty useless,"I agree with many reviews. There is really no point to this bra. I get more comfort from old navy sleep tanks. There are seams that dig into my sides and poke. Barely any firmness and no support. I prefer cotton wireless sports bras to sleep in for a firmer, cozy hold, and sports bras also have thicker fabric. The fabric on this is very thin."
3,"Comfortable, but a little small","I really like this nursing bra. It's supportive, soft and comfortable. My only complaint is that it runs a little small. I'd recommend ordering a size up."
2,"TOO SMALL, even after I exchanged it for a larger size.","I thought this would be a good bra, but both sizes I tried, much bigger than I needed according to the charts and other reviews recommendations, were too tight, too small, and too uncomfortable to wear. I went through the exchange process and everything, yet it still didn't fit. I'm so disappointed. Never again."
3,Loved the style; size and quality a bit off,"I really wish I had a sleep bra while nursing my first two children!! It was wonderful! I agree that you should order a size bigger. I ordered my 'normal' size, but it rode way up my back. The quality was poor - it got a little run and the seems came apart over the months. I had read the reviews so I was always careful to wash and dry in the most gentle fashion possible. I was able to use it for the 8 months that I did nurse, so it wasn't a complete loss. I am still happy that I ordered it."
3,"Okay, but not great,","I purchased this bra after reading all of the reviews and I have to say it is not that great. I bought a large since almost everyone said the bra runs small. I am currently a 36C and the large is a bit big but I can't say for certain a medium would be better. The bra does ride up in the back and despite some other reviews, you cannot wear it during the day unless you are wearing a high necked shirt. The cut doesn't work for v-necks or tank tops.One thing to note, the bra stains very easily so if you want to keep it looking clean you will have to use nursing pads. The milk stains did not come out in the wash (perhaps it is the material).While I don't think the bra is great, it is comfortable and provides easy access for feeding time."
1,Poor quality!,"It was great and comfortable for a week....then it ripped to shreds and is no longer usable. Waste of money, imo. Wish they were better constructed!"
2,Not worth the price,"This bra is very flimsy and thin. It is also small. I bought an XL and it is small on me (36DD). It is ok for sleeping, but I bought a much nicer one at Destination Maternity for half the price."
5,Good support,"Really comfortable to sleep in. Makes a good support for my not-such-a-big breasts.Soft from inside, even with sensitive nipples.Could be easier to put on, but that's all."
5,couldnt ask for anything more,bought this for my wife about a month or so ago. my wife loves this. comfy and very practical if you are breast feeding.
2,Too small!,The 38 C/D is more like a 34 B! Ridiculous. Can't even wear the thing. I hate that I thought I was buying a snug sleep bra and now I have nothing.
3,Runs really small,"I bought this to use while in the hospital when my baby was born and it was TIGHT. The sizes run really small. Other than that, I like the product."
2,Uncomfortable,"This bra is not very comfortable aTheir had problems with the sizing- the medium was too loose and the small is too tight. Also, the bra is not very supportive and the material is very thin. You're better off sleeping in a camisole."
4,works for me but I can see where others may not like it,"This bra has worked well for me - I wore a 38D pre-pregnancy and I didn't not have any sizing issues with the size XL BUT as I get further along, the fit is getting less than desirable. I can see where someone with larger breasts would have sizing issues with this bra. So far, I like it just fine and wear it every night!"
1,Put me to sleep!!!,"This was the most boring video ever! I was looking for a good overview of the Passover for my confirmation group and yearly Seder meal and bought this with the other people's recommendations. Big Mistake!! I am throwing it away, it was soooo long and the narrator spoke slowly and every scene is forever. There wasn't a 10 minute segment in the whole thing that I would show my congregation without putting them to sleep!"
3,Layman's view of the last Supper,"This is a very general view of the Last Supper and gives only an idea of what it was like. The seating arrangements were more European than Jewish and the bread used is leavened rather than unleavened. It is the accepted views rather than the actual based on latest research. Da Vinci's last supper is a nice picture but lousy history. After all, Da Vinci was a artist and not a historian. This DVD gives a very general view and perpetuates some misconceptions. But generally, it is a reasonable attempt."
5,Understanding OEF/OIF True Enemies,"This is the best book I have read so far on where and who the real enemy is and who is behind and against the U.S. supporting democracy and the liberation of the people of Iraq.Breaks down in detail who is Sunni and who is Shiite.How they work and how they are fighting U.S. Forces together.How the real enemy is Iran with many proxies to gain control of Iraq.How the U.S. must change to deal with fighting in Irregular Warfare now and for decades to come.How the enemy is capitalizing on U.S. democratically controlled Congress to gain victory.Heading over to OIF II in a few months, active duty CDR O5 who will be working in support of the bravest of the brave (EOD Forces defeating IED's). This book was instrumental in developing a understanding of what is really going on.I would recommend this book for all Officers and enlisted personnel heading to fight this fight from E1 up.CDR Bill Noel (Navy EOD Officer)"
4,Good explanation of a confusing subject,"The book gives a good acccount of the various Islamic militant factions and their interactions. The opinions seemed a bit ""armchair general"" and opinionated at times, but they made several good points. I'd recommend the book although it had the following drawbacks for me:-The insertion of outside material to back up the author's words made for a sometimes disjointed read-The sprinkling of ""God (Christian) & country"", stereotyping, etc. seemed unnecessary-20% of the material was a repetition/reiteration of a particular point (not sure if this was to beef up the number of pages or to compensate for a shakey arguement)"
3,Babies don't bowl,"It's very cute to look at, and the appeal, as most toys, is to the buyer, a parent who buys for cute instead of practicality. What baby knows anything about bowling? As with most infant toys,it is too advanced for the child, and the child gets very little use out of it unless an adult plays with him, as was my case. My 5 yr old grandson loves to play with it, as long as I am playing also. The baby, not so much, except just to throw the pieces around."
5,Adorable and down right cute,"This toy is really cute, soft, and fun. I bought this for my son's birthday. It was a great choice. I even bought it for a friends son for his birthday."
3,bowling,"I do believe this is a nice toy. Unfortunately, I purchased it without previewing it at a store. I think this toy would be more appropriate for older infants and younger toddlers than what I intended. I also thought it was a bit priced for what it is."
5,Very Cute,When I saw this bowling set in the store I just had to buy it for my 14 month old daughter. We have had it for three days and she just got the hang of rolling the ball to knock over the pins. The ball and pins are so soft; I think this toy would be appropriate for a younger baby too. The pins are numbered so this toy will be great when she starts learning her numbers. I can see her using this toy for at least another year. I would recommend this toy for anyone with a child under 2.
4,Fantastic product,"The kids love it, the animal pins are very cute and they have bells in them so its not just visually pleasing. Good as a rattle even when they are too small to knock them over."
2,Pins fall over too easy,"Cute, but the pins are hard to get to stand up. My 3 year old has a hard time getting them to stand and gets very frustrated. They are still cute toys but not as intended."
5,Great for 18 month old!,Our 18 month old granddaughter played all afternoon Christmas Day with the animals and ball. Didn't get around to showing her it was a bowling game; all in due time!
2,They didn't stand up,"This is a cute set but the pins don't stand on their own. I ended up returning it because my 17 month was bored. I think it was a little too baby for her. She also didn't get the ""bowling"" concept since the pins kept falling over before she could roll the ball."
3,moderately enjoyed,I had bought this for a baby cousin 2 years ago (when he was about 15 months). He didn't show any interest these cute bowling-pin animals and had preferred to run around rather than bowl. Only recently has he started showing interest in them- but only to throw around. I guess this item is better for more sedate children.
1,Cute but not played with,"After reading such favorable reviews I bought this bowling set for my son's first birthday. We've had the toy now for a month and he is not very interested in it. If I set it up for him he will toss the ball at the pins a couple of times and then look at a couple of animal/pins and then he is done. I don't much care if he bowls with it, but he doesn't pick it up or ask for any of the pieces either.While the toy is cute, something not played with is money wasted. The toy seems well made and probably durable but without a child to love it, I just can't recommend it."
2,Not popular with my two year old,"My two year old does not have any interest in this toy yet. She will shake the cows sometimes as they rattle and toss them down the stairs, but that is the most she will do with it. She did get a lot of other toys, so over time her interest may increase, but so far, this is not something that appeals to her. We may have to take her bowling one day to see the whole purpose of it."
3,Fun for throwing,My little cousin loves the plush though he cannot seem to understand the concept of bowling. He loves the texture of the figures and throws the ball in an attempt to knock down the pins. This toy is great even if not used as expected.
2,expensive.. not worth money and not durable...,"I bought this toy for my son when he was about 14 months. He never touched and those bowling pins doesnt stand well.. no matter how hard i tried to make them stand .. they fell. Also, packing cover was ripped open with in a month after i bought the toy. there are better product in the market for less price."
4,Cute and well made,"These are very well made and a 'classic' toy. No batteries, no electronic sounds, just nice soothing old fashioned baby sounds, emminating from these adorable bowling pins."
1,Cute but not functional,These are adorable and soft for little ones to play with but they don't stand up well. They need to redesign so that the bottom is weighted and flat. I ended up getting ridD of them early on because they frustrated my toddler so much.
1,Sloppy,"This is a sloppy toy. Not a lot of fun, hard to set up, and they don't stay up too well. I cant think of a reason to buy this thing."
3,Knock'em down,"We received this as a gift for our daughter. She has never really used it as a bowling set. She plays with the ball separately from the pins. The pins do not have the most stable bases but that didn't matter. Our daughter refused to let them stand up. We would stand the pins up all over a room and watch her make a mad dash to smack them all down. She loved to do this. Later we started using them for counting and identifying animals and sounds. Overall, not a bad product and still fun even if it was never used as a bowling set."
2,Not the greatest,"This toy looked really fun, but it's best for babies less than one year. Children that young can't bowl, but I suppose some might be able to throw the ball at the pins. The pins and ball are plush and they jingle. So I see this toy as more of a set of cute looking rattles than a bowling set. Also, the animal pins don't stand up that well."
1,Stop buying and selling this thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Okay I thought this thing was gone, done, no longer to be seen. To my horror it is still out there!!!!!!!!I am sad to say I am the director's little sister. We got to preview this crap before it ever hit the stores. He has passed on so let the movie pass on too. If everyone knew the man that created this crap, you would second guess laying eyes on it. It it not worth any amount of money. True B movies do not need to be put down for being put in the category with this."
2,Fun for a While...,"Just about everything in this slasher/revenge flick is poorly executed. If you're a fan of unintentional B-movie humor, this does the job pretty well. However, it gets tiresome after 20 minutes or so."
4,Breakthrough,"The Blue's album ment Zucchero's breakthrough in Italy and certain parts of Europe, it's a nice mixture of rock, soul and a touch of blues. The cd contains many now Zucchero-classics like the original version of Senza una Donna, Con le mani, Pippo, Hey Man and the beautiful Hai Scelto Me. If you like this album you might also want to buy the '95 Spirito DiVino album and the '01 Shake album (featuring a duet with the late John Lee Hooker)!"
4,great italian songwriter,"I like Zucchero very much, this is not the best he made, but if you like a mixture of Blues, Rock and Pop than take this disk!"
3,nothing special,"This novel is readable but not tremendously deep; it creates a hero who is in an undeniably interesting situation (i.e. being a Jew in a country from which all Jews have supposedly been expelled, which means he cannot convert to Christianity without risking additional punishment), has all sorts of implausible escapes from danger and inexplicably masters a wide variety of occupations. In all, the kind of novel that is perfectly fine for a few hours in the airport or on the beach, but no classic."
1,Nothing new,"If you have read ""the Physician"" of the same author, then don't bother with this one. It is the same thing in a different place and diferent time. But the author don't exploit at all the fact of setting the novel in one of the most tragic events in Spanish history. The result is a shallow book. Try to find and read ""El puente de Alcantara"" (Alcantara bridge) Of Frank Baer, and you find out what i mean"
4,What happens next?,This is not a bad read and I will give Noah Gordon another try but I was left at the end of the book wishing for more. The story of the Jews in Spain is a terrible one and in too many ways not much improved today.My preference is for a story that ends happily ever after (of course was not possible and in this story it did end as happily as conditions of the time allowed) and I was left wondering would how long the pretence of being Catholic go on? What would happen to the child or children? There are more questions I have along this line but inasmuch as I was not the author I must leave the story to him.
4,Nice book,"Even though I am a catholic I enjoyed the book. Learned a lot about those times in Spain, which it's hard for me to imagine how could someone -- Jew or not-- could survive with a society where just a insignificant remark against the church could cost your life. I recommend this book to be read also by those who want to know a little more about the Inquisistion times."
5,GREAT BOOK - GREAT AUTHOR,"I am in the process of reading everything that Noah Gordon has written. The first book I read of his was ""The Physician"". Fantastic book! Writing style draws you in from the first word. Can't say enough great things about this author. Highly Recommend"
2,A German Classic - but a bit boring,"I read this one in highschool. It is a play about the son of a count (Karl) who has a very ambitious brother (Franz). Franz creates a rift between Karl and his father setting himself up to be the next count while Karl is hunted as a criminal and joins a band of robbers becoming their captain. In the end Karl will return, but it may be too late already. Don't want to spoil any surprises for you...The play defitely is a German classic and one of Schillers most famous works. I still found it a bit boring. It never really took off. I have read other plays that I really liked. I also read other stuff by Schiller that I liked. I don't think that I am particulary biased, but I think my time would have been invested better by reading sth else. Also, if you do not read German fairly fluently don't buy this edition; it is the original German version."
2,"A nice knfe, but . . .","This is a nice knife, but the blade tip does not go down far enough in the handle when closed. So, if you finger rubs along the top, it will snag/cut your finger (which happened to my daughter)."
2,Old fashioned,The instructions and styles were too old fashioned. Knitting has come a long way since this book was published. I bought it because it is a classic in knitting history and I hoped it would illustrate knitting basics. More modern books have much better instructions.
1,HORRIBLE! take it from me...,"I bought this as it was the ""nicest"" (most expensive) highchair...WRONG! my baby (6 months old) hates it (too confining) and the tray is up to his eyes!!!!! Whats the point of it if he cannot use the tray? The thing is HUGE i mean huge and if you have a small space like me you'll grow to resent it. I sold it and am getting the Stokke tripp trapp with the baby rail- totally worth the extra $$ as it grows with the child (becomes a booster etc). I've heard the peg is a nightmare to clean up too.Cons:HUGEhard to clean uptray is WAY to high to ever usedid i mention HUGE?????expensive for a big piece of plastic***UPDATE***we ended up with a $20 high chair from ikea (!) that we LOVE! it's so much smaller than all the rest and cleans up so easily which will be so important to your sanity!!"
3,okay highchair,"It was given to me and was used by at least two other children before my son. The leatherette was worn out by then so I bought slip cover instead of a new cushion. With the slip cover, it's easy to clean. The tray is high but it keeps my son from grabbing the bowl when I don't want him to. It's easy to roll around. I'm not sure why people are so unhappy with it. If I had to buy a chair, I'd probably go with something cheaper with similar features."
5,Highchair for life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this chair when my 1st born was 3 months old, 5 years ago. She used this chair for eating and napping, it was wonderful. When my 2nd child was born three years later, I used the same chair and the beauty is that all i had to do was order a new cover for the seat without having to buy a whole new chair. I EASILY removed the straps and washed them by hand, it was looking brand new. Im personally a clean freak. My house is always spotless even with my two children and the chair was always easy to clean. Im pregnant with my third child now and I did not even hesitate to pick this chair for him. I guess this chair is not for everyone, some people should just stick to Graco or something cheaper. This is a quality chair and it deserves quality care."
2,Not the greatest.,"Now that I have this chair, I'm not going to replace it but I have two major complaints about it. Our son is 20 months old and I still have to put a book wrapped in a dishtowel in the seat so he can comfortably reach the tray or our dining table. Raising the height doesn't help because the arms of the chair come up so high and so far forward you can't scoot the chair in any closer to a table. The chair also has a very large footprint--unless you have a very spacious dining area it's hard maneuvering around it. If I could do it over again, I wouldn't buy this high chair."
2,nightmare to clean!,We had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes. I am not a neat freek in any way shape or form. But you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny. If i had to buy another chair I would get a wood one. We have the Eddie Bauer booster now that our son is older. We clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week.The Prima Pappa is comfortable and secure. In the end I realized that we didn't need all the bells and whistles!
1,Please don't waste your money!,"I am very disappointed in this high chair and we own 2! Our twins are 2 and they still must sit on pillows to reach the tray (and I'm sure that you can imagine the mess of cleaning the pillows daily). **Important** the tray to seat ratio is fixed!! You cannot adjust this!! And be careful of the light colors, they crack and get dirty and will not come clean.We received these as gifts but had we known how bad the chairs are, we would have returned them."
1,Bad heair length and uneven,"When I ordered this doll I needed it for my state board exam and the bonus was the table clamp, as our state board requires to have the table clamp and not a stand alone tripod (which is what I already had). Also the cost of the doll head with the clamp was cheaper than buying just the doll head at a local beauty supply store. Upon receiving the doll head, the hair length was not as long as shown in the picture, the hair length is uneven throughout the ENTIRE head. There are very short layers around the parameter and even shorter pieces and layers inside and throughout the rest of the hair. The hair is very coarse. I ended up having to purchase a new doll head anyway. So I spent $30 on a table clamp and another $30 for a GOOD dollhead. Dont bother with the deal of the clamp and doll head, its not worth it!"
2,A fair had.,"The reviews I've red are accurate, I purchase this doll head to practice hair cutting and is so difficult even to section the hair, because it comes with different lengths of hair all over the head. The hair is coarse but natural, and after many shampoos, hair treatments, and few hair cuts, now with few inches less that hair looks healthy and shiny.Now if you want to take a challenge this is a good head. For cosmetology state test won't work, but for esthetician state test (CA) will work wonders. Just gentle remove undesired makeup."
3,MS Lori-kin Manikin Head * With Clamp,"I did receive the manikin. She isn't beautiful by any means, but she will get the job done. One eye is bigger and set higher than the other, but like I said, she will be fine for school purposes. One of the main reasons I ordered this specific manikin is because she was supposed to come with a clamp. I did not receive the clamp. Can anyone tell me how I can go about getting my clamp?"
4,"ok , for the money",For the money it is a great product. The hair is a little stiff. My daughter would have liked a little better quality of hair. but for a child this is a fun product.
3,SCHOOL TIES DON'T ALWAYS BIND,"This thought provoking, if somewhat narrow scoped, film features early performances from some of today's leading men: Brandon Fraser, Matt Damon, Chris O'Donnell, Cole Hauser and Ben Affleck. Based on some real experiences from screenwriter Dick Bishop, director Robert Mandel keeps the movie focused on Fraser's David Greene, a Jewish high school senior who gets a football scholarship to the elitish St. Matthew's Prep School, but knowing the prejudice he might face, he doesn't tell anyone his religious affiliation. ALthough he is initially treated with due respect and makes good impressions on both staff and fellow students, Damon finds out that Fraser is indeed a Jew and thus begins the dramatic conflict of the story. While the outcome is fairly predictable and not as climactic as intended, SCHOOL TIES features strong performances from the young cast and hints at what lies ahead for these talented actors."
5,Top-notch movie with a great all-star cast,"Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Chris O'Donnell, Amy Locane,and Brenden Fraser team up to make a spellbinding movie. This drama includes sports, love, and a great story, to make this movie a great one."
5,"Great movie about racism, tolerance, and honor.","This movie is simply great. The cast is great, the story is great, the message is great."
5,Michaela,"This movie is classic! It describes perfectly the difficulty one has trying to fit in to a society that has no tollerance for people and/or ideas that differ from what is considered acceptable.Fraser, O'Donnell, and Damon are all academy caliber actors who play their parts to perfection. After seeing this movie I rush to see more of Fraser and O'Donnell, but I must say I was a liitle wary of watching Damon because I despised his character so much in ""School Ties""."
3,Rather predictable,"A lot of prospective big stars are featured in this production - Matt Damon, Ben Afleck and Brendan Fraser - but the overall story line is the let down. It's a 1950s coming-of-age piece crossed with a tale of anti-Semitism at an elite New England prep school. The look is certainly right, but the plot is a cliche: small-town boy football star is recruited to help the preppies win their big game, and all goes well, until the prejudiced preppies discover that the hero is Jewish. Then it all falls apart, but predictably. The acting is well done, though."
3,good message..good movie,"Brendan Fraser(Mummy 1 and 2,Glory Daze) in one of his more better roles, plays David Greene, a Jewish kid who gets into a wealthy college as a star quarterback..there he meets his new friends, Dillon-MattDamon(Dogma, Glory Daze, Good Will Hunting), Randall Batinkoff(The Peacemaker and Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Anthony Rapp(A Beautiful Mind), Ed Lauter(Pythopn, Not Another Teen Movie), Ben Affleck(Glory Daze, Dogma, Good Will Hunting), Jayce Bartok(Suburbia, Spider-man, Swing Kids) and Chris O'Donnell(Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, 29 Palms) and David hides his ethnicity and then Damon finds it out and then chaos ensues...Fraser delivers a promising performance and so does Damon as the evil preppy rich kid who wants it his way..some good moments and not so much good moments..all in all its a movie not to be missed"
2,Falls flat on its Star of David,"I was hoping for more from this movie. I was disappointed. This movie had a lousy ending, and didn't even seem to end. I couldn't believe it when the credits came up. So the Matt Damon character gets kicked out, and makes a bold anti-semite statement at the end? Huh?I remember reading the description, and imagnined that the students were going to rush forward and support the Brendan Fraser character, as he's about to get kicked out, for cheating? Huh? Nobody showed support? It was just a sad story, with no real feeling. I actually disliked it more than I learned from it. Every direction he turned there was no support. Who wants to watch that?I agree with another reviewer. I think the movie ran over budget, and they had to kill the last 20 minutes of filming.Boo!!"
5,School Ties,"Love the movie and all the great stars in it. I recommend it to all who love Brendan Fraser, Damon and Affleck."
4,nice product!,"I'm amazed at how easy this dye was to use, and the vibrant color it delivered! Also very happy that it was the only dye I've used that can lift manic panic color without turning gray. Awesome! The only problem is that the color is already starting to fade slightly after two weeks, but I blame my damaged hair. Over all, great product. I'll be using this again!"
1,No effect on dark brown hair,"Save your money if you have dark brown hair. I bought the copper red and had to hold my hair to the light to see any hint of ""copper red"". I dyed a blonde swatch and the color turned a med brown red. So much for drama. This was using a 30 volume peroxide for 30 mins. No high-lift properties as advertised."
3,THIS IS NOT THE HARDCORE DELTA 9,"This is a mellow rock band - and NOT the hardcore gabber DJ from Chicago (aka Dave Rodgers), so don't spend your money on this one (like I did)!!"
5,You must own this,"OK, even if you have the bootleg that has been floating around for some time now, you still need this CD, at least for the cover art, personnel listings, and the fact the Mr. Wyatt gets paid something. If you don't have the bootleg, you doubly need it. Why? The music. He and a ensemble of highly sympathetic musicians play the whole of Rock Bottom and then some. The first time I listened to it, I wondered who the drummer was, as he was sounding pretty good. It's none other than Nick Mason sounding much jazzier than Pink Floyd ever let him be. The fantastic South African trumpeter Mongezi Fezi is there as is also Gary Windo on sax. And we even have the BBC's John Peel doing the introduction. So, Robert Wyatt fans, pony up on this one."
4,Pure delight!,"Phryne Fisher and her companion Dot are on the Ballarat Train. Phryne awakens realizing the first class car is filled with chloroform fumes. She opens the windows, saves the passengers but realizes that the quarrelsome mother of one of the passengers is missing. The mother's body is found badly broken and Phryne agrees to find the killer. Additional, Phryne rescues a young girl who has lost her memory.I've said it before, but Phryne is who I'd like to be when I grow up; beautiful, smart, tough, independent, fashionable, wealthy but mindful of her poor beginnings and willing to help those who truly are in need. She has a wonderful, ever growing, cast of supporting characters who are diverse and interesting in their own right. This was not the strongest book in the series, but I do love the series overall. These are slightly over the top, just plain fun books."
1,Just not that entertaining,"There just wasn't any depth to this book. Not that I was expecting War and Peace, mind you, but I was certainly expecting more than what I got. Based on very little evidence AT ALL and with every scintella of evidence pointing directly at only one suspect (and glaringly obviously so) we know who the murderer is almost upon the first mention of him in the book. Characters are physically well-described, however their personalities are flat and one-dimensional. No one in the book dares question or challenge the main character - all are enamored of her including any and all law enforcement types. Her romance with a young man she has just met is not germaine to the story line and yet it fills up page after page after page. Sorry, it's just not a good story."
4,Fell in love with the series,"I'm not sure what caught my fancy with this heroine but I have so enjoyed reading about the life of a rich young woman in Australia between the world wars. Her romantic lifestyle is one I would never consider and wouldn't have considered interesting, but somehow the author reaches out and pulls you into the story. There is a real period feel to the book with it's not very hard-boiled private detective. I am working my way through the series, a nice combination of modern female detective with 1930's flair. Guy alert - fashion descriptions galore."
1,How utterly Muggle!,"Not to mention tiresome. Who the heck cares if there is a ""positively Christian"" way to read these wonderful books or not? They are entertainment, not theology or even serious spirituality. And just what would ""positively Christian"" mean anyway with 500+ official sects and many varieties of interpretation within even them. Why must Christians, or Moslems or whatever group of people need to make such a work of entertainment their own or pass their blessings upon it?...The notion that magic is vestigial in these works is simply ridiculous. Of course if there is any magic then vestigial aspects of Dark Ages Christianity will strive to determine whether it is ""of the Devil"" or compatible with some generalized notion of Christian doctrine. YAWN."
5,Laugh Out Loud!,"I think this is the first time I've read a self-help book that made me laugh out loud--several times. The author has a great way of combining practical, easy-to-follow techniques for improving life with light-hearted humor.Each chapter focuses on an individual technique for making improvements in all aspects of life. I've put several into practice with incredible results in my life.Reading this book is like having a life coach right there next to you. Don't miss this one!"
4,who's heard of chicago house,"I'll try to spell everything right, unlike other reviewers. These cds are a good example of Chi-town jackin house music. Farina is pretty good, but if DC doesn't get your head noddin' to the point where you almost get in a car accident, than there's something wrong with you. Go listen to Oakenfold, or Tiesto, and wave some glowsticks around. Bangin!"
1,if you like deep house then forget this one.,"i don't know much about Derreck but Mr. Mark Farina was used be such a great DEEP HOUSE dj back in the days... Mushroom Jazz, cisco sessions and so forth... So, when i saw the cd at some local cd shop, i bought it without checking out samples. Big mistake!!! the BPM was way too fast my DEEP HOUSED ear drums, thus it sounded like Hollywood's stupid big club music (Mark, you sell out!! I remember he did 8 hour set just outside of L.A. only a few years ago...) If you like hard or progressive house (they suck by the way) you'd love it."
3,Not same as picture,"The product is functional - it stretches to fit the golf club. However, the actual product is definitely different from what the picture shows. The piping is green, not yellow. And the lettering is about one-third the size of what the picture represents. My son was looking for something to show his Packers support - this is not very impressive looking in person."
4,"""Terminal love must be contained, before it gets too complicated.""","Ivers' high voice, spare instrumentation, and surrealist lyrics light up some dark remote galaxy in the subconscious."
5,A Must-Buy For the Hipsters on Your Shopping List,"Fabulous vintage images, amazing original photography and clear clever writing make this take on the most celebrated type of make-up a must read for pop culture afficianados. A perfect, inexpensive gift for style-minded friends. A great little coffee table book for you too! Air kisses to the authors who really seem to know about what they've dabbled in."
1,Yawn. OK pictures. High school text. Buy a magazine instead.,"One magazine that reviewed the book referred to it as being like a high school text book. Another magazine wondered where the ""cultural history"" was, and asked where the insight was. This is one of those books that you can pick up and flip through for the pictures once. Maybe twice. Needless to say, I didn't like it."
1,"Vapid, stupid and tiresomely ""hip"".","Chronicle Books titles tend to be pretty to look at but short on content, but this one has to be the ultimate. You'd have to be an idiot to spend money on what is one long Vogue article."
1,An extremely abbreviated history of lipstick in the 20th century,"It took me longer to drive the 2 miles home from the library than it did to read the entire book! Seriously. This book is only 116 pages, and heavily illustrated. Many of the illustrations are not captioned, so I have no idea what they are for (other than general artistic photos of lips, lipstick tubes or women applying lipstick); and the book ends on a strange note, almost as if it were in the middle of a paragraph. I kept checking to see if pages had been torn out by some previous library patron. There's not too much about the history of lipstick per se - there's a lot of talk about how lipstick 'empowers' women and a lot of talk about how sexually suggestive lipstick is (the tube, not the actual product), and a few names of classic (now discontinued) lipstick shades or ad campaigns that were bombshells in the day. But otherwise, this is really something you might browse through at a doctor's office, not a keeper."
2,Mixed.,"I'm mixed. I kind of liked this book. I always am looking for new books on fashion and makeup, and I don't think there are many books out on just lipstick, but I wish that there was more about how to wear it, like advise and ideas on color and style, and some tips like you see in the book ""Making Faces"" to go along with all the heavy historical information. Alot of the historical information was a little too heavy and dry for my taste. When is the book on eye shadow coming out?"
2,Where is the meter and poetry?,"I found this production to totally flatten out the music of the lines. It had some interesting casting choices and a couple of good moments, but overall I found this production lacking life or drive. I have eight different Hamlets (Olivier,Burton, Brannaugh,Gibson, Jacobi, Williamson, Hawke, and finally Cambell Scott) on video and this is ranks toward the bottom. Only Ethan Hawke's Hamlet do I like less. If you want to see a good American performance of Hamlet, then watch Kevin Kline."
2,Disappointing,"Wait for the Kenneth Branaugh version of Hamlet. Although the Campbell Scott version has its good moments, generally it lacks energy. The sword play is so reserved that it gives the impression that the actors didn't want to hurt each other. If you're really interested in buying this version of Hamlet, borrow it from the library first. You may find my copy there soon."
3,Interesting cast,"I read a review on line that Campbell Scott was the best Hamlet. I am not convinced of that, but the cast is certainly interesting"
4,Very Enjoyable!,"I've always lumped this band into those indie bands (the ones you never hear on the radio,but always ""the next best thing"" in rolling stone). I decided to give this album a listen over break when i was bored. Wow!It was alot better then i thought. I thought the cd was going to sound like the duke spirit, but this band def. held their own. This cd actually turned out to be pretty good. Most of this cd is catchy, and alittle ahead of its time if it was made 10 years ago. Most of the tracks are pretty fun to listen to, and they give off a beach boys/ mamas and papas kind of vibe. Overall, if you want to listen to something interesting,fun, and enjoyable you should def. buy this album, its well worth it!"
5,"Don't think, just click ""add to my cart""","I already had all these mp3s, but I bought the album from Amazon anyway. Why? The New Pornographers are a fine, fine band. They will appeal to Neko Case fans, 80's New Wave rock fans, and lovers of social commentary from north of the border. Neko Case is absolutely beautiful and her voice is the greatest of our generation. Am I in love with Neko Case? Like many thousands, sadly, yes. If the reader wants to understand why I am obsessed with The Virginian and this Canadian supergroup, simply listen to the track samples."
5,Great debut!,"Mass Romantic is a great debut album from the New Pornographers, a Vancouver-based indie band. Most of the songwriting comes from the Destroyer's Dan Bejar and Zumpano's Carl Newman. The sound on the album is very power pop and indie rock at the same time. The vocals are sung very catchy and the instruments are used in a fun way, making you want to sing along. The album is noisy, fuzzy, crunchy, and hook-heavy. It gets better with repeated listening. Overall a great album!"
5,So HERE'S where Carl ended up!,"Of course I'm speaking of that brainchild Carl Newman, fronter of the band Zumpano and their two SubPop releases. Everytime I play their ""Changes"" album, I have withdrawls for more material. That said, I have three thoughts to describe this album (someone heard my prayers!):1) Carl is still making music--the music world has some hope.2) His ""Going Thru Changes"" is one of my favorites of all-time.3) His debut from his new project is even BETTER.The talk is about Neko Case singing on ""Occupant"" and the Madness-style of ""Alcholism""--both great songs. However, in my book has there been a more perfect pop song than ""Body Says No""? I wish I could get that to my local AAA station. Simply an outstanding, wonderful debut."
1,Mass Noise,"Apart from the pretty stunning 'Letter From An Occupant,' sung by Neko Case, this cd is uninteresting noise. NP have nothing on the Beach Boys. There are plenty of opportunities for catchy hooks on this record, but they're repeatedly, frustratingly missed. Don't bother with this. Grab a copy of Neko Case's, 'Furnace Room Lullaby,' and sigh with relief."
1,Neko Case fans might want to pass on this one.,"I know Neko Case cut her teeth in punk bands but that is still no excuse for this. Actually, she only appears on the first cut, which, not surprisingly, is the best thing here. It's not that the music itself is bad--kind of a Green Day meets Cheap Trick---there is just way too much going on here. Too many hooks jammed into too few spaces. After about halfway through I was desperately hoping for, oh, a slow song to provide relief, but there was none. Way too jarring and claustrophobic for repeated listenings. Sort of like the Boomtown Rats on crystal meth."
3,A few memorable songs along with other more generic stuff,"Very catchy, by the numbers pop rock often coasts along at a nice upbeat rate that does not insult the listener's intelligence, but rarely excels into those hinted themes of pure pop bliss. While the energy is there, only a few of the album's 12 tracks really stand out against the slightly-above-generic majority. Those few songs blaze a path of upbeat, frenzied melody with the hint of ol' bleeding heart thrown in to yield an overrated, but noteworthy for it's few standouts, collection."
5,Excellent--this is what good music sounds like,"This is so so so good. Get this CD and put it on permanent rotation. And Neko is, of course, staggering. Brilliant stuff."
1,"not a book, a manuscript","i ordered this book to get a book, but what i got was a huge manuscript of sorts which weighs a ton and is huge! i wanted to read it on my commute to and from work, but it's far too big for that."
4,The Man Who Laughs,"The Man Who Laughs has a compelling central plot and four interesting central characters ( one being a wolf)but gets bogged down by excessive detail that is at times annoying. Had Hugo told the tale in half the time, it would have been more satisfying."
1,Terrible Book,"I was forced to read this book for my History course last year. It was supposed to give us insight into the 1920's era. It just made me bored. There was no plot that made me even the slight bit interested in what was to come or in any of the characters. The entire world in Babbit was made up of a bunch of conformists who wasted their lives. If you want a story about not conforming and without a plot, read Joseph Heller's Catch-22. Though too long and absurd, it was at least funny at points. For any students who are forced to read this book, get the cliff notes if you can."
1,What's to like?,I don't understand why anyone would like this book. It was boaring and had to much of Babbit's everyday life. Sinclair Lewis spent pages on frivolis information. There was no plot to the story and the book went on forever. If this book is on your school reading list Pick another to read.
1,Kill me now so i don't have to finish this book,"I am 15yo. This is a stupid book. I only got to the second chapter. All he talks about is his shoes and his clothes and what his wife's going to wear. I don't care what his wife's going to wear or his shoes! I'm glad my school only makes us read the first couple chapters of a 'classic' and then allows us decide if we want to read the rest. If not, the suicide rate would be higher for literature class."
3,Babbit,"I choose this book because it is on the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die list and I have read some other books by S. Lewis. I enjoyed the book, but I did not love it. I felt bad that Babbit did not appreciate what he had nor took responsibility for what was his. I guess there is nothing new under the sun, as we still see this lack of appreciation and responsibility."
3,Babbitt`s journey,"Upwardly aspiring George Babbitt`s journey to find himself elicits many feelings about him; pity, empathy, understanding to name a few. His pursuit of social elevation, his boredom and disconnection from his family and friends, his discomfort with his own angst and desire to be loved, accepted yet free of the confines of accepted thought are all elements in play in his spiritual, emotional world. He knows nothing and charmingly wants to know everything, to do the right thing yet not feel boxed in by the norm. This book written nearly 100 years ago strikes a chord in today`s world yet takes us back to the world of flappers and an American dream that was full steam ahead. Still relevant today and still recommended. 3 1/2 Stars."
5,My favorite book,"This is one of those books i can read over and over again. It's in depth character descriptions and satirical analysis are charming, enlightening, and genius. He manages to be both affectionate and wildly cruel toward his characters. This book made me laugh and laugh and laugh and cry."
2,Drab,"This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, ""Edith Wharton did it better."" The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of ""clever"" critique into the narrative.As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time."
3,Good book,"Only 3 stars because it is not the most exciting or enjoyable read. But, it is an important read about materialism, having the wrong dreams, and middle-class conformity. I think that ""Death of a Salesman"" is a more touching and interesting tale of such things, but keep in mind, that drama came out 20 years after Babbitt.Reading Babbitt will make you re-examine your own life and will hopefully stop you from making the mistakes that poor Babbitt made."
2,Only gets good near the end,"A one-joke book for three-quarters of the novel, satirizing the bourgeois conservative customs and morality of '20s business culture (a joke that could play equally well in the '50s). As such, a crushing failure, that wallows in its own too-unsubtle unsubtle humor. But then suddenly, with less than a hundred pages to go, the book suddenly gets good--very good, as Babbitt is confronted with a mid-life crisis. Novel gains an entire star for its thoughtful and sensitive treatment, that manages, with powerful irony, to manipulate the reader into hoping that Babbitt will return to his unthinking conservatism. 2 1/2 out of 5 stars."
2,One dimesional elitism.,"I picked this up after reading Arrowsmith (which I enjoyed) but didn't finish it. I enjoy French and Russian lit with its long and deep analysis of almost every detail and this book would stand in stark contrast to most of my favorites. Babbit (the book and the character) is almost completely one dimensional. It reads more like a pamphlet than it does a novel. I t reminds me of current cable news - business is bad, industry is bad, and the making of money through business is bad. All is bad, bad, bad, except for the poor peasant who tills the soil to earn his bread. I finally put it down without finishing it. The sarcasm and elitism did me in. Thank God for Hemingway."
2,This book is not involving,"From the jacket cover, Babbit would seem to be a highly provocative novel about the true nature of the American dream. While it is about the American dream, the book seems to run only on one joke: Babbit's rampant materialism. This joke wears thin within the first 30 pages, and the reading the 400 more pages is a tedious task."
2,Old school,"Well I had heard about this book many times, and while I enjoyed it, it is a very old style of writing, and by the halfway point i had lost interest.If you like books like ""the razors edge"" then you will probably enjoy this otherwise move to a style more modern."
4,"Is this, in fact, how men think?","Bleak, sad, commentary on one man's life. Thought-provoking albeit not inspiring. Well written, well developed characters, engrossing - difficult to put down.."
3,speaking of flip flopping,"True convictions? Never! Babbitt represents rapidly and constantly shifting, opportunistic, precarious society where alliances to groups with power determine one's place and survival in the community. A house built on the shifting sand and alot has to do with luck. Only if things could be this simple, there wouldn't be any temptations, conflicts, desires or dilemmas.....Alas! Babbitt is hilarious, nevertheless, a tragedy. I am giving only 3 stars because the writing style was not as engaging, and story didn't seem to pick up until about the half way through."
4,I don't know who George F. Babbitt is.,"I just spent fourteen hours over the last couple of weeks with George F. Babbitt, listening to the audio version of Babbitt. I wouldn't recommend his company to anyone. He is a joiner, follower, flaky, unreliable and a man of no agency. Things happen to him and he acts or reacts trying to sound out what he thinks others might think best of him.George F. Babbitt is not my friend, no matter how much time I have spent with him recently. I wouldn't suspect you want to be his friend either. I suppose that this is a credit to what I think of your character. As for Babbitt though, he is an interesting character, but I don't know if Lewis created a new archetype or just adapted one. I think this is a triumph no matter, as he created a character sketch that is effective but never defines the character.I still don't know who George F. Babbitt is, do you?"
4,Babbit,I'm listening to Babbitt on tape right now and frankly I'm finding it really depressing. I think I'm identifying and seeing too much of the character in myself.
4,Babbit is boring,"I found it very difficult to sustain my interest in this book. I found it to have a flatness of language and feeling, as if it were written by Babbit himself.I understood that Sinclair Lewis was at once satirizing and presently sympathetically this Midwestern go- getter, shallow and ambitious, who too is hypocritical in his betrayal of his wife.I find that the great writers create characters who we come to deeply care about.Somehow I could not do this for Babbit.The fault may be in the reader, but I found the whole enterprise boring."
5,Great Book,"If you have read Personality Types then this book is even better. It actually shows you who you are by a series of questions. I remember because it showed me I was wrong about my own self (after just reading Personality Types)! So, needless to say, this book along with Personality Types is all you will ever need to learn to about psychology."
4,Personality X-Ray,"This interesting book featuring the updated Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator is useful and worth reading. I took time time to answer the 144 questions and what I discovered confirmed the test I have already carried out online with the simple personality test. To improve on your person and on your relationship with others, you must have to know your fundamental compression and the sub-compressions. These 144 questions are well selected, realistic, and sensible. If you can, just read the book and carry out the test and I assure you, you will never regret it."
4,Very good introduction to the Enneagram,"This is a great bookthat serves as an introduction to personality type and the Enneagram. First of all, it includes the test. This is a forced-choice, thorough test which took me almost a week to complete (the reason being the questions are hard! After 20 or so questions I felt exhausted). After that there is a small section on each of the types.The info of your type is short but amazing. There are diamonds of information and I read it over and over again, each time finding something new.You can, also, ""try to type"" the people in your life, although this is not really accurate.My only negative would be that after finishing it I felt it could have contained more information on each of the types, and thus making this a more complete book. My advice would be: yes, buy this book if you are an Enneagram novice, but be prepared to want to buy a second more advanced book to learn more."
2,What a price hike,"What are you doing, taking advice from Netflix? I bought two boxes at $59 bucks each and that was many months ago. I search for more on Tuesday and the price is still $59 bucks. Wednesday I go to buy two more boxes and the prices jumps to $91 bucks. Today, it's up to $94.99. First of all, it's foam. I have always had problems with companies selling this stuff for so much freaking money! I thought I found someone, ""Music123"", that understood this and had a fare price. Guess I was wrong. Let me know when the price of foam comes down in the market place and then we'll do business, until then you can keep your over priced foam bedding."
4,"Hey, they work and the price is right.","It took me one and a half of these kits plus some home made bass traps to tame the living room HT/home recording studio. The result is really worth it at this point. My only complaint is the glue provided wasn't enough for me to glue all the squares in the kit. So either I went heavy, or they went light. It's the best deal I could find."
5,Unbelievable,"I was about to order this foam kit from Guitar Center's website, the total came out to be over 130 for just ONE kit. So, to find this kit for only 60 bucks is amazing. I can order two kits for less than the price of one."
5,awsome ...,This is a nice set the Anybody can play with it for ours.I love the texture if you are a true harry potter fan than I also recomend the set chamber of secrets I have almost every set with the help of santa. buy this toy NOW!!!
5,Nutripoints,"Nutripoints is an excellent way for individuals to learn to eat a balanced healthy diet that promotes health and healing in the body. We use Nutripoints in all of our programs at The Center of Integrative Medicine in Richmond, VA. Nutripoints teaches the value of nutrient dense foods and also simplifies how to identify and incorporate these foods into their diet.Our patients not only see improvement in their health but also lose weight. Patients on average lose 21-22 lbs. in 12 weeks with Nutripoints. This book is a must read for anyone wanting to improve their health and learn more about how food contributes to our overall health!"
5,"I'm Becoming Healthy, Finally!","I've tried most ""diets"" but Nutripoints is a way of life. My objective was to get healthier and, after 9 weeks, I'm making better food choices, losing weight gradually and continually, and am happy and content with my eating. But best of all my Type 2 Diabetes is ""healing""! My glucose has gone from 257 to 149 and my A1C, from 7.3 to 6.7! I still have a ways to go but my doctor is thrilled with my progress and I'm almost off my medication. I like being able to finally ""eat right"" without the hassel of dieting and am so glad I discovered Dr. Vartabedian and Nutripoints!"
3,didn't need an updated version,"since my old nutripoints volume was over 15 years old I thought it was timefor an update that took into consideration the latest nutritional evidence.i would recommend this version to someone who had never owned nutripoints,but if you have an older one, there isn't enough difference to warrant the purchaseof a newer version"
2,Dangerous Pieces!,"Although this toy is still a favorite for my 16month old son, I had to remove the magnets from his reach. I found him with the circle magnet stuck in his mouth. I scared me to death, but I quickly removed it. If you buy this, please remove the magenets before you let your child play with it!!"
5,Way over priced here!!,you can buy this at Toysrus for 60 bucks!!!I dont know what this person is trying to do for 190!!!! other than rob you!this is a great toy but shop it elsewhere!!!!!
2,Not Worth It,"I bought this toy in Toy-R-Us and it was much cheaper then this. ($59.99) So if you really want this toy, I say take a moment and look arould for it. I wasn't happy with this toy becasue of the sharp corners which are bad enough to hurt anyone. There isn't alot going on with it and I found that my son became bored with it quickly. Also, the top of the maze comes off and doesn't lock down as well as it should. If a child pulls on the maze, they could pull the whole thing off. All in all - I dont think this toy is worth the price tag."
1,not a toy for a 18 month baby......,"my daughter loves it but it is so dangerous since the top where the beads are comes off easily and my daughter almost killed herself a couple of times. This top does not comes with any type of security locks so it will fall off on the floor as 1,2,3 ....and it can be very dangerous. My daughter step on it and even got stock on it. I don't understand why the company that has made this imaginarium toy had rated 18m and up. This toy is definitely great for older kids!!!!"
5,Fantastic album a must have for Ramazzotti fans,"This CD is a masterpiece, the duet with Andrea Bocelli is breathtaking. A must have."
3,watch box,"Although box is made well and of hefty weight, it arrived with two small chips just to the left of the locking mechanism. The locking mrchanism was inoperable and I had to dismantle and repair it. Otherwise the box meets my needs..."
1,What a strange book....,"This is one of the oddest books I have seen in a long time. The text looks like it was typed on a typewriter. At first I thought this might be just a visual style, but on closer examination it really does appear to have been typewritten. Whole sections appear to be reprinted photocopies of documents from other sources.There were two useful sections, however. There was a section that listed the licensing requirements for claims adjusters by state. I have been unable to locate this information any where else. However, I can't verify the accuracy of the information. The other useful section gave a list of job titles which cover the duties and responsibilities of a claims examiner. Those two sections may be worth a look for a job-hunter, but given the cost of the book, I suggest asking your local library to obtain a copy for you via interlibrary loan."
4,Dispels Myth about Growth,"This study of ""growth"" is important reading for all managers. Too often, growth is considered the Holy Grail of management, resulting in more, more, more without thought of the potentials for ""better"" growth that is possible or the dangers of ""bad growth"". This book is short, incisive and well worth your time."
2,Trite,"I had heard great things about Ram Charan, so perhaps my expectations were set a bit high. I realy got very little out of this, indeed, I didn't finish it. This review is of the audio edition. I have a bias against professional readers who don't understand what they are reading. While the reading was very professional, it tended to put one to sleep, because the reader didn't know where the important infections were. Other details like pronouncing DEC (Digital Equipment) as ""Dee Eee Cee"" added to the impression."
2,A real disappointment based on his past successes,"I have really enjoyed Ram Charan's writing in the past. I have really enjoyed Ram Charan's writing in the past. He is generally simple, clear, but most important actionable. This book, however, was a real disappointment to me as it fails to deliver on it's promise: 10 tools to use on Monday morning. I guess Ram got stuck on simple and clear but the sad fact is that profitable growth is neither and this is where actionable is left in the cold.One point was outstanding: look for singles and doubles (not out-of-the-park home runs) and build on those over time. But he could have said that in a journal article or a business magazine commentary and saved us all a lot of wasted time reading."
3,"A few good ideas, but pretty wordy","I purchased this together with Ram's other highly-praised book, ""What the CEO Wants You to Know."" I'd give the CEO book a D review and this a C review because this at least gave me a few new ideas. Charan's style of using stories to reiterate his points started to quickly annoy me, but I did get a few tips. As an operations person, I thought it had a pretty big marketing focus, but still reinforced a few good ideas such as the need to ensure you're not always just looking for ways to cut costs, but grow revenue with the same amount of costs."
3,Didn't live up to expectations,"I should have read the reviews a little more closely. Sounds like most of them know Ram personally.This is a fine books, but not great. As an executive, I don't think it deserves the 5 star rating that it has."
4,Thought Provoking,I found the book every interesting. Nothing ground breaking but Ram Charan says it like it is. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick read who wants to learn about business growth.
3,This is a great book -- but not a quick reference,You must read well into the description of a plant to find out if it's shade or sun lover. It's not something you can quickly discern.Also missing is the distance needed between plants which is so helpful when developing a bed and purchasing more than one of each kind.
3,"Read it for the vibrant history, not the story","A workmanlike later novel in the Blackford Oakes series. The detail about Vietnam and the politics of the time (much of it is set in 1964) is striking and vintage Buckley. However, the fate of Oakes' colleague and titular character is obvious from early in the book. Read it for how it brings history to life in a fictional setting and to catch up on the latest in the life of the series hero -- both are worthwhile, and entertaining, reasons. But not as much for the storyline; there isn't much mystery here."
1,Toilet this book,"I found that this novel had more viewpoints than an actual story. And just what was the story? It seemed that ten pages could have been enough. Stupid, stupid, and more stupid!"
5,Difficult,"The delivery was very prompt. The pieces were crazy, it took me a while to get this puzzle done. Would def buy more like this. More the difficulty the more I enjoy."
5,Good book on incorporating your business,"How to Incorporate is an excellent book to show the average guy how to incorporate. It is an easy read and packed with good information.Some other books you will want to read are Form Your Own Corporation and Launch a Business In Any State by J.W. Dicks, Inc. Yourself by Judith McQuown and Incorporating Your Business for Dummies by The Company Corporation. For more information on S-Corporations, How To Form A S-Corporation by Robert Cooke is the best book that I have found and the one most recommended by successfult business people."
4,Gave me some basic ideas on incorporating our small business,"It answered a lot of questions I had about incorporating our small business. However, it would be an even better book had there been a chapter dedicated to what can be written off along with what percentage of the total cost or value of things. This always seems to be a gray area. Overall, it was a very informative book"
3,typical dance tune....,"the girl does have great vocal skills...too bad the lyrics and the beats are not that fantastic. nothing too special here. purchase this one only if you are a Judy Torres fan already, because this one is not going to make one out of you."
3,Where's the old Gund lamb?,"My grandson who is 6 has gone through at least 3 of the old Gund lambs & they were wonderful. This one, with its closed eyes & rattle, is kind of annoying. Please bring back the old Lambie."
3,Gund Lamb is cute but....,"My daughter never really liked this. It sounded like a good idea when i bought it, but she really never played with it at all!!! It sucks because it was supposed to be her ""first stuffed animal"" but she never liked it. Oh well i guess..."
3,Much smaller than it looks,"I thought that b/c this was available in regular and mini that this one would be much bigger than it appears in the picture. Not sure if the dimensions are listed in details but it is about 8"". A very small stuffed animal with a rattle inside. This was a gift from the Easter bunny so it ended up fitting well in the basket but it's much smaller than you might think! Very cute and soft...just small."
5,A Must Have Book for this Holiday Season,"What a great book. My kids love it and read it every night. It is often confusing to kids nowadays to have two gift giving holidays in the same month. This combines both holidays in a funny and warm way. I wish this book was written when I was a kid. I plan on buying copies for all my nephews. This is destined to become a parenial classic. I also think that with so many interfaith marriages this a good book to unite both religions. Many book stores in my area are out of stock so if Amazon has it in stock buy it. When ""Fiddler on the Roof"" came out people thought of it as a Jewish play until they saw it and realized it was about all imigrant groups. Everyone should try this book. You won't be sorry."
1,Do not buy this book--not even from your local bookseller,"This book is an insult to the rich tradition of Chelm stories.Interfaith families would be better served by a warm holiday story of some sort, instead of one that messes with traditional culture.Just because the Chelmites are fools doesn't make them unaware of how to celebrate Jewish holidays. There are plenty of Hanukkah stories around that feature Chelm and Chelm's silliness. The endorsement by Leonard Nimoy on the book jacket shouldn't compel anyone."
4,Another great Stephen Chow flick!!,"This, like Shaolin Soccer before it, is an absurdly funny movie. It is much in the style of the Naked Gun movies, however the humor is strongly based in the images and appearences of the main characters. It has a cartoonish quality that is difficult to duplicate into a live action setting, but Chow does it almost flawlessly.Not to mention the fight scenes are freakin' awesome. If you liked Shaolin Soccer, you might as well buy this one right now."
5,"Funny, great music, and action packed!","Kung Fu Hustle is one of those random movies that you heard about from friends and reluctantly decide to give it a try. The blend of animated effects, music, and fighting is what made the movie so enjoyable. The music is just amazing with the drums, violins, and classical instruments. What's hilarious in the movie is how the characters start to dance to a musical piece that is playing in the background. I will admit the movie is a bit gory for the skittish, but it is mostly cheesy violence. The movie is a work of Art and describing everything that defines its success is hard so rent it if you're still in doubt!"
5,It's an axe kicker!,"Just as Blazing Saddles was a parody of every western ever made, so is Hustle a parody of every martial arts film ever made. It's brilliantly done and very witty. I love the deadpan humor and snappy one-liners. This movie exceeded my expectations. I've watched it several times and each viewing reveals another hidden jewel: a subtle joke, double entendre, or a line from some classic film. And the film isn't just all axe-kicking; there is a good story line, at times exhilarating, hilarious, thoughtful and poignant."
5,ROTFLOL,"This movie has some really funny moments. It's got a good message inside the movie, but buy it for the hilarity of the story. Excellent entertainment."
4,"Kung Fu, LoliPoPs, Urination, it's got it all !!!","This is a comedic Kung Fu movie with some flying / air fighting elements in it, as well as comic book style fighting. There is also what appears to be CG special effects.Although I don't usually like movies with flying style moves (save The Iron Monkey), this movie is actually a decent mix of choreographed ground moves, air moves, and comic book style moves. They did a very good job in blending the moves together seemlessly.As far as the plot goes, it is fairly well done. You don't really know for sure what's going on at first, although there are plent of hints, but eventually about half way through the plot you'll figure out what's going to happen at the end. As I stated earlier, this is a comedy, and the jokes are pretty funny, at least to my immature self.End note: I viewed the chinese DVD of this movie -> only cantonese and manderin audio with english subtitles. I'm guessing the english version differs only in the audio track."
5,Laugh A Minute,"Wow! For a movie that is in Cantonese, it is absolutley hilarious. Two misfits, dress up and pretend they are part of the Axe Gang thast run the town. Unknown to them, they walk into a village called Pig Sty Alley, where there are three Kung Fu masters and Two Higher Kung Fu masters who live there. They try to act tough and think they can bully the people. Then the real Axe gang show up and mayhem starts from there. But one of the misfits does not realize that he is also a Kung Fu master and by the end of the movie he has to fight the ultimate evil, and he uses and becomes the Kung Fu Master that he was destined to become. A very funny movie, that has a sweet ending. Subtitles are available in most languages. Watch out for the chase scene, that ends with a big billboard."
3,doesn't have much of a story line but good special effects,"this movie doesn't have much of a story line... and it feels kind of arbitrary. however, if you are into entertainment and special effects, then you may still like the movie.for people looking for a storyline, Stephen Chow's shaolin soccer could be a better bet."
1,KUNG FOO HUSTLE,This movie sucked I myself don't like movies that you must read in sub-titals because the movie is not in english PLEASE make sure all my future movies are in thwe english langauge thank you.
2,Really didn't like this,I was disappointed with this film. It grew laborious to watch about 1 1/2 hours in. I started using the fast-forward button as I got to the end.
1,Hong Kong Kung Fu movies at its worst !,It is movies like this that made me stop watching Hong Kong Kung Fu films years ago. KFH has neither interesting dialogues nor a minimum plotline. It has zero entertaining value because1. all the jokes fall flat.2. actions are cliches.3. acting is abysmal.
1,Really bad Kung Fu Movie,"This movie is enough to make me quit watching Stephen Chow's movies. I had expected more of him. There were some very good special effects, and some reasonably good fight scenes, but over all my impression was ""why did I waste my money?"". In a lot of this type of movies I can set the language to Mandarin and practice my Chinese, this didn't even have that choice. Overall my recommendation is don't even waste your time renting this one."
5,This movie is awsome,"I wonrk in a movie theatre and have been disappointed to see that barely anyone is coming to see this movie. Not only is the score excellent, but the action is good and refreshinly void of wire-fighting. This is definantly something worth seeing if you have not already. Though I get to see the movies for free, I do not hesitate to say that I would pay to see this movie, and that should mean a lot coming from me, the miser."
3,The hatchet Tong gets wisdom kung fu style?,"The bad guys are really bad, and the good guys arefunny old guys? This makes for drunken kung fu master typesof humor with deadly consequences for the unsuspectinghatchet killers? We find an army in black with suits, hatchets, guns and top hatsagainst a dock worker type, a cook and tinker?Typical of a gang, the leader takes it out on his own men for failing?If you like martial arts and the language of subtitles doesn't bother you this is a pure fun movie."
4,Good Fun for Everyone!,"Kung Fu Hustle is a good movie for the family or anybody. It has its moments of smart and silly comedy, and a good dose of fighting. I would compare this movie to a mixture of fighting from The Matrix and the silliness of Jackie Chan movies and the spike tv show MXC. These features make the movie a little different than what you are probably used to but does it in a good way."
1,Fail,The movie was only 3/4 of the way burned to the disc. I know it's a good movie since I have seen it on DVD before but this vendor did a poor job in description. Who wants 3/4 of a movie?
5,4.5 for bd of Kung Fu Hustle,"viewed on a Panasonic 50"" plasma via a Panasonic DMP-BD80 through a Yamaha RX-V869 receiver (5.1 speakers) and an HDMI splitter/amp.a definite upgrade over the DVD, although the 'roadrunner' sequence shows sub-par greenscreen effects.PQ - great. nice 3D pop, nice details.AQ - outstanding uncompressed PCM. your speakers will get a workout during the first appearance of the 'lion's roar', and the preceding fight with the musician/assassins.trade in your DVD of this, and get the BD."
4,This is hilarious!,"I rented this movie from Blockbuster, and after I watched it, I had to have it! This is a well written (of you like spoofs) hilarious movie! I'm also a huge fan of ""Shaun of the Dead""! So if you like that type of ""off beat"" humor, you'll love this movie!"
2,technically brilliant but empty,"There are some pretty breathtaking special effects and handsome cast members but in the end this is a film all about virtuosity and technical brilliance at the expense of anything remotely meaningful.if you have an appetite for violence/orient,but want something deeper check out 'House of the flying Daggers' or 'Ong Bak'"
2,Quite hilarious...,"But plain stupid, and exagerated. Stephen Chow can do better than that. More storyline please!!!"
2,JUST PRAIN REDICUROUS!,"Some of the visuals were good, but it got boring after 30 minutes. Why people would give this four or five stars, makes absolutely no sense! I wouldn't recommend it."
4,An Underrated Surprise Film,"This film was definitely a surprise to me and my friends. When I first saw the trailer promos for this movie, I didn't think it would be worth seeing in the theater, and I LOVE martial arts flicks. The title alone was dumb enough, but the promotors for this movie in American theaters should be fired out of a cannon. I waited until the DVD version of Kung Fu Hustle came out. My friends, (some of whom never even heard of the film), and I watched the DVD version and we were completely blown away. Kung Fu Hustle is not the cheesy, campy, cartoon like martial arts flick that it was promoted to be in the U.S. Yes, there were some comedic moments in the film, and even some subtle tributes to other martial arts/action films, but this movie was so much more than that. If you like martial arts/action/fantasy genres, then Kung Fu Hustle will definitely not disappoint you."
4,A whacky good time,"Kun-fu Hustle is a fun martial arts comedy. With how cartoonish it can be, I guess you can call it a fantasy as well. Even if you are tired of Kun-fu movies you should be entertained by this movie. It has the style of an old black and white movie in some ways. It sort of reminded me of a Buster Keaton movie is some ways. I mean by the comedy, not the martial arts of course.You have a lady with curlers in her hair that can run as fast as the road runner and who's main power is her screaming. Also scrawny looking guys who are really great warriors. One of the funniset scenes takes place when Stephen Chow challenges some town people to a fight. He wants to prove himself worthy to a badass gang. Anyway each person he chooses that look wimpy turn out to be covered in muscles. Even a little kid that he challenges, is ripped. The movie is great fun and good for a laugh even if the final battle is overly silly and not as funny as it could've been."
5,You'll Never Look at Lollypops the Same Again!!,"Wow..what a movie! I had no idea what to expect when I saw this DVD. I had heard the reviews but I was hesitant to see a movie with subtitles that seemed to be filled with Kung-Fu images I didn't really know much about. Well, I was mistaken. What a riot and what a great, great story. Part broadway show, part action spoof, part art-house cinematic genius, this movie is great on so many levels. The story itself is a winner and even when the fight sequences go on a tad too long, stick with it because the payback is awesome. You'll howl at the ""axe-gang"" thugs and marvel at the digital and real life stunts that are shown. I actually think the subtitles added to the movie's humor and they were not bothersome at all. The ending was priceless.Watch the gag reel at the end. Bloopers are bloopers in any language."
4,Martial Arts Fun Festival,"Even if you don't like Martial Arts genre films, this movie is the one to see! A young man and his sidekick want to be gangsters. A landlady and landlord want to run their community in peace and QUIET! And, The Ax Gang wants to be Best Dressed. Practically every form of martial arts, known and unknown, is represented in the film. The movie is consistently funny, including the ""Looney Tunes"" action sequences. Kung Fu Hustle is over the top, a spoof and fun to watch."
5,I laughed. I cried. I damn near pee'd my pants.,"I am MAD about this movie! Can't tell you how many times ive watched it but it never seems to get old with me. I compare it to another fav of mine, The Matrix. Love it when the good of the little people of this world overpower the evil doers. I think every one has a little Kung Fu Hustle inside of them. You just need to know where to look.This movie has something for every one. Stylish martial arts,comedy,action,drama. The whole nine yards. Stephen Chow as Sing is funny but is also riviting when he is performing those martial art stunts in the movie. I became a fan when i saw him in Shalolin Soccer.Land lady, played by Yuen Qie, is hilarious! The way she slaps people around is reason enough to watch for me.If you dont mind subtitles and want to watch a movie thats far from the norm i totally encourage you to check out KUNG FU HUSTLE !!!!"
4,A little violent kung fu comedy,"I'm a martial arts movie fan, even when they're not so good, I usually find something in them I like. This film, like other Chow films, is goofy yet very entertaining. The CGI is nowhere near top notch and even looks bad in a couple of spots. But that just adds to the fun of the film. This story has bad guys that aren't that bad ( but they do kill people); and good guys that aren't that good (they try to kill people). I love the very funny slapstick style humor. Best viewed with other ""karate"" movie fans, I'm glad I made the purchase. If your not a fan of these type of movies then save your money. But if you're like me and you love the cheese, it's worth the $15. bucks."
5,Definitely a MUST HAVE for all kungfu fans,"I love this movie so much! It's got the typical stephen chow style ""mo lei tao (nonesense)"" humor that's made him the most popular actor in all of China, and combined with gorgeous kungfu fight scenes, this just screams a good time :-D for anyone who wants to sit back, relax, and laugh til your belly aches after a hard day of work, this is THEEEE movie to get!"
5,Just wonderful in every way!,"From Tango dancing Ax murderers, a Kung Fu reincarnation of Paris & Helen of Troy to deadly martial arts musicians, this movie never stopped enchanting me.I never stopped laughing. If you want to see a perfect send up of all the wire fu movies of recent years(chinese and american) then see this movie. It also has a strange and beautiful love story at it's center.Just see it, you won't regret it. I will definately put this on the must buy list."
4,Strange but Hilarious,"A friend recommended this movie to me. I don't usually like Kung Fu movies but gave it a try. At first, I didn't think I'd like it but about 10 minutes into the movie, I started to get it. It has some of the funniest scenes you will ever see in a movie. The knife throwing scene had me absolutely screaming with laughter. It's kind of like Napoleon Dynamite in that it's not a movie for everyone. It's violent but in a cartoonish way. Also, it is subtitled and I know some people don't want to have to read subtitles. It's honestly hard to describe. It is a kung fu movie and a comedyand a love story and a morality play and a live action cartoon all in one. It's one of those movies that you will either love or you'll hate. I loved it!"
5,soundtrack,"Just to make it clear, this dvd does contain the originalchinese soundtrack, as well as english and french, even thoughthe amazon description, for some reason, does not mention it."
4,"Artistic, Stylistic, Entertaining and Fun",A lot of thought and choreography was put into this movie and it paid off. There was humor and satire but also poignancy and drama. Plus lots of kung-fu action. Steven Chow knows his stuff. Good movie and soon to be another addition to my personal collection because it is worth seeing more than once.
5,Funny Movie,"Great Movie. Arrived on time and was in perfect condition. This is a classic for the collection. My wife ,who is chinese,says that the dialoge is slightly different on the version than the one we saw earlier. I don't know if it was edited for the version or not. But this was a great buy."
5,Awesome Kung Fu,I love every part of this movie. The action scenes were just awesome making it the best martial arts movie of the year. Movie also filled with hilarious scenes. Money well spent for blu-ray buyers like me. A must have!
2,Not the theatrical version.,"This DVD was cut in order to get a PG-13 rating. Much of the blood has been taken out. When it didn't pass PG-13 rating, they put the blood back in and it got a NC-17 rating. So what you have now is an R rated version that is not the theatrical version. Just so you know..."
5,funny is understatement,"wow I watched this movie the other night, and I could not stop laughin...so funny"
4,Funnier the first time.,"When I saw this movie in the theatre, I laughed until my stomach hurt. The movie is so ingeniously conceived that there are hilarious surprises throughout. The action sequences, both the real ones and the animated ones, are fun to watch. As do many other Stephen Chow movies, this movie tells the bittersweet (yes, somewhat simplistic) story of a downtrodden person, managing to be entertaining along the way.Since the laughs are mostly based on action and surprise, its entertainment value diminishes the second time you watch it. So, bottom line: you should rent this movie, watch it together with friends, and have a very pleasant movie night. Just do not watch it a second time."
5,Finally own it!,I've always liked this movie because it's hillarious. Finally found it here for a good price and did not think twice when it came up as a suggestion when browsing through other funny movies. The movie condition was good and have no complaints.
5,Hilarious and Hardcore all in one!,"This movie is fun and hilarious. It's a funny martial arts movie. Be advised that you will have to select (English) Dubbing for the language, as it is a foreign movie. This movie has a great storyline and plot. The wardrobe, make up, and sets are very good for a movie of this type. The actors are great! This is a classic movie to own, and it's great entertainment. Movies like this are highly unique and rare... it's a must have and own. The sound quality is very good, with hard hitting fight sequences, and great CGI effects. Buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks."
5,Excellent Blu-Ray disc.,"Kung Fu Hustle on Blu-ray looks/sounds excellent. I already own the DVD version of Kung Fu Hustle, but watching Kung Fu Hustle on Blu-ray is a vast improvement. With its vibrant colors and incredible sound, Kung Fu Hustle is definitly one of the better Blu-ray releases I have seen so far.Just like the DVD, the Blu-ray version is also loaded with extras:-commentary with Stephen Chow, Lam Tze Chung, Tin Kai Man, and Chan Kwok Kwun-42 minute behind-the-scenes featurette (in Chinese with English subtitles)-2 deleted scenes-30 minute candid Ric Meyers interview with Stephen Chow (in English)-5 minutes of outtakes-trailers for Resident Evil 2, Underworld 2, and xXx"
4,Fun and entertaining,"I bought this movie before I had even seen it hoping that the movie would be as good as my expectations were for it. After the 2nd time I watched it, (first time I fell asleep) I really liked the movie. Because I fell asleep the first I missed alot of storyline and when I woke back up, I didn't think it was that great, but I gave it another chance and really enjoyed this movie. It is dubbed in English or you can just read subtitles, but you will miss a lot of the movie while you are reading. The actions is great and made to be over done but that's what makes this movie cool. It's like watching a cartoon knowing that real people would never survive half the things that happen to the people in this movie, but we accept it because it is funny to see what happens to them, just like in a cartoon. I didn't care too much for the axe gang dancing around, I thought that was kinda dumb, but I did really enjoy this movie. Check it out."
3,"It was, shall we say, a put-together of great and horrid?","When this movie started, it was dreadful. Lots of stupid stuff, and not good enough acting. Also not very funny humor. However, there was one good thing about the first half-the battle scenes. They were great, but it only heightened my liking a small amount. Then there was the second half. More fighting, less dumb humor, and a lot more coolness, especially in the final fight. It was awesome. And I loved the ending, where the protagonist and the girl he knew for trying to save got together again, and married each other. I do think they'll be a grand couple. Though it was a good second half, there was just to much loser stuff and stupidity at the start for it to be one of my top movies. But, it was OK overall, and I thought I'd hate it. Good thing I gave it a chance to finish. This is the kind of movie you should see if you have nothing else to do(at least in my opinion)."
3,Identity crisis,"Interesting movie.You've got slaptstick Keystone cops like comedy, impressive serious kung fu fighting, some brutal violence, special effects -good and bad and a cute mute ice cream seller with a lollipop. It seems though that this movie doesnt know what type of movie it wants to be. I think this is what made me keep watching it as I wanted to see what film genre it would next try to be.Quality of the DVD was good both sound and picture. As far as the story goes, it was a little loose but generally kung fu movies arent known for their quality plots and executions anyway so I wasnt expecting much anyway.Overall entertaining, at least on the first watch."
3,Not that funny,I watched the movie and didn't find it very funny. There was some humor but nothing stood out as being overly funny. No belly laughs here!
5,Hysterical,Great movie. Glad that we can watch the subtitled version as the English dub is terrible!..... . . .
3,Why do they always edit!,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be the same as the original overseas version but with english as an audio option. It did but I was very surprised that they edited certain shots. Scenes where blood spilled out or sputtered out of people in fight scenes were digitally removed. Why? I have no idea. If you ever saw the original DVD (Chinese version) you'll understand what I am saying. Editing is stupid. Let the people decide what's good or not for themselves.Also the Blooper Gag reel is nothing to laugh at. Literally.The interview is boring and the commentary is in Chinese only (Unless I missed something)By best advice is if you can get the original version, do so."
3,The armadillo gear ruins it,"This is the basic construction master pro calculator and if you like that brand you will love this product. I strongly recommend buying the basic version without the case if you can find it. The case is hard to open, seems ill fitting, and makes it uncomfortable to hold in your hand. Also if you get the one with the case, the traditional slide on cover is not included. I could understand if the case was hard to open because it was water or dust proof but it is neither. The gray cover that goes over the front does have sharp corners though that makes it uncomfortable to hold. Great product. Horrible cover."
4,great deal,I havent had much opportunity to use it yet but I'm happy with my purchase and the price I paid for it.
3,Good for Calculating on site,"Good calculator for estimating purposes, and for calculating field dimensions. Just wish that it had a ""cm"" to ""feet"" function."
4,Her Last Release,"This was Mary last recording and her voice was basically gone by this time due to cancer, but what she does with what was left is still that 'classic' Mary sound over some nice danceable material, the motorcity sound fits very well with the remakes of ""My guy"", ""You beat me to the punch"", ""Keeping my mind on love"" is nice but almost made me cry hearing Mary's voice down to a whisper. This cd is for Die-hard fans only!"
5,It makes you wanna dance.,This album is great. It even makes my mother want to dance. And thats a first in about 20 years. Especially the title track is a killer.
4,Cool,"Yes I have listened this cassette few times, and is good. It is longer than LA FLACA , And from this album(DEPENDE) , the song that hit me was ""Te miro y tiemblo""(I Love the guitar arrangements in this song. it start low and slowly built in to Guitar Rock! ) . Others songs like the title ""Depende"" are good .They can play Good rhythm Guitars. ""Agua"" is very low cool. good album."
5,Pau Dones and Co. keep getting better!,"Without sounding repetitive, this album is phenominal! Musically, it's a logical continuation of the chords and melodies found on ""La Flaca"", but emotionally it dives much deeper into the things define us. Of all the things that can be said to describe this album, I'll only say that it's obvious Pau Dones couldn't write a bad song if he tried. Get this CD now!"
1,"Ya no lo soporto, quitenlo ya.",La flaca aun era algo pasable pero su nuevo album no me podría tener más harta. Tienen unas pintas que no se si es porque creen que la moda es así o que no se ven al espejo. Pero eso no es lo que importa sino que los ritmos de las canciones son todos iguales y aburridos. Y la canción Depende está ya tan repetida como la Macarena
5,Brilliant!,"This book combines the best elements of science fiction with an intriguing spiritual dynamic. The writing is crisp and clear, a delight to read. I readily recommend this book to others and sincerely hope that it finds the wide and appreciative audience it so richly deserves! My only question is, when can we expect the next book?"
3,Serves It's Purpose,"If you need a filter holder, this gets the job done. A couple issues I have with it...1) On my wide angle lens, I cannot use the widest setting or the adapter will get in the frame. At 10mm (16mm on a full frame camera), the edges of the adapter show up. I have to shoot at 11mm. It's a tradeoff.2) The adapter does not conveniently pop on and off."
2,"if you have a non-wide-angle adapter, saw 2 slots off",I thought it would have been a better idea to buy this instead of hack off the first two slots of a regular cokin adapter because it shows up on my 17mm Sigma lens. The build quality isn't as good. The regular cokin adapter has nice rounded edges. This adapter looks like it was cut w/ a sharp blade on the front (including the sharp edges) but is slightly different in the back; I fixed the sharp edges w/ sandpaper :-)I wish someone would make an inexpensive alternative wide angle adapter that goes closer to the lens w/o needing to buy an expensive $70 Lee filter holder...
3,Still vignetting on 11-12mm on Nikon DX format,"I brought this filter holder to use on my D90 + Tokina 11-16/2.8.It's something that cut two of the three slots of a regular P series filter holder, and it only hold one filter. There is no adaptor ring come with the holder, so you have to prepare one yourself. Build quality is solid, but don't expect too much.I just received the package and did simple test. On 11-12mm, obvious vegnetting, especially on 11mm since the four corners are totally dark. On 13mm and above, hard to find vegnetting. In my opinion, it's completely safe to use it on 16mm and above on DX format. Acceptable on 13-15mm. For those who intend to use it on FF format, you can calculate the equivalent focus.Hope my review helpful."
3,good product,"This is the first time i have been using Cokin products and will still have to get used to it.I think they are the best from what is out there on the market, but still not perfect.I have noticed that on my 24-105mm lens when going down to 24mm I see the black edges of the Cokin frame. Not ideal for pitcures."
4,Lego alternative,"I'm not die-hard Lego fan. But we bought this as a gift for a kid who is, and his mom's feedback was that he loved building something other than Legos - and the interchangability of the sets is fun and adds to creative play."
4,Good toy,I love the toy. My twin 2 3/4 year old boy and girl absolutely lived it at first but now don't pick it up as often to play with. They have a great time taking off the wheels. I actually keep them in my car to keep them busy. I just make sure to locate all the pieces before we get out.
2,Too simple!,"Bought this for our son with Autism. This wasn't complicated enough to keep his attention. Received this in plenty of time and in perfect condition. Just not complicated enough to keep his attention. But, thank you!"
3,Love the car - but wheels fall off,"We love automoblox at our house... But a warning about this particular truck - there is a wheel that falls off because the hole is off-center. We bought and returned three before we found one that had all four wheels manufactured correctly. Automoblox would not replace the wheel because it was not purchased directly from them. However, if you do find one that has good wheels, this truck is great!"
4,"A bargain, must buy","I hated the RIo dvd so much that I thought of boycotting Rush! Horrible sound, camera angles that shifted every 2 secs as if editing was done by someone with adhd... The R30 was better, my favorite was exit, stage left which I still have the laser disc copy of (purchased in '89). I also have laser discs of Grace and Show of Hands and they look good too.Snakes in Blue ray looks wonderful! I just got it yesterday with a blu ray machine and it is like being at the concert again. Only complaints are that the atlanta bootlegs look a bit contrasty, but other wise, it is a good disc, lots of music. Oh, for those who wish they did ""Time stand Still"", when I saw them do it in concert ('90?), it wasn't that great-Getty sang with Manns voice piped in over the speakers while you saw ariel footage of canadian forest on the video screen. ""Witchunt"" was a way better choice and heck, ""Natural Science"" was awesome as well."
3,RUSH ROCKS BUT.... WHERE IS THE BASS???????????,"Concert itself: 5 starsVideo quality: 5 starsAudio quality: 2 stars ( the low frecuencies are really really absent.... its not joke!, i have a lot of concerts and the 5.1 mix from this BD is not good. I prefered the stereo option)Extras: 3 stars"
5,The way Concert DVDS should be filmed!!!,"I managed to pick this up Saturday, Nov. 22, and watched it sat night. Great Work by the boys from up north. First the sound quality is really, really good, the setlist is great. (I saw them on each leg of Snakes And Arrows tour, and they played the best I have ever seen them play.) What makes this DVD Really special is the camera work, they focus on the boys playing and on stage interaction. All concert DVDS should be filmed this way..."
5,Excelent.,"Finally Blu-Ray. As stated here several times, this is the best RUSH show ever recorded on DVD. Now lets wait and see if Dream Theater follows and releases a Blu-Ray concert with anchored cameras that move smooth across the stage so we won't get dizzy while watching. RUSH have been setting the production trends when it comes to this genre of music so I can't wait to see Dream Theater learning something here. I could live without the fast zoom-in and zoom-outs though. It's borderline amateur."
5,Rush at it's best,"If you are a long time Rush fan, or just getting to know the band right now, and you can afford only one concert DVD, this is the one I would recomend. This is by far the best sound and image quality in any Rush concert (and the other ones are not really too bad).The song set list is really interesting, including a good portion of new songs from their latest studio album, Snakes and Arrows, the classic hits like Tom Sawyer, The Spirit of Radio, 2112 and Limelight, and the long lost gems like Circumstances, A Passage to Bangkok, and Ghost of a Chance. The performance is unbelieveably solid, and it's full of the well-known Rush humor. Do not miss this one."
5,mmmmm Rush live...,Great quality for audio and video. Would of liked more segments with the band. Great to see this concert on video. Lots of rare tracks and great old ones. Great to see the trio doing what they do!
5,Worth it,"Right to the point, the best sound, the best picture. DTS and blu-ray add Rush and you get a great live performance DVD. If you are a Rush fan, this one is for you .You will be glad you picked this one up."
3,RUSH totalmente LENTO,"Soy fanático de RUSH desde hace mas de 10 años y este ha sido el peor concierto que he escuchado de ellos, se escuchan MUY LENTOS en todas sus canciones, pensé que era un error al momento de grabar el CD, pero al escuchar el SNAKES & ARROWS en CD de audio confirmé lo que ví en este DVD.No se porqué han bajado la velocidad y la intensidad de su música, pero realmente se escucha mal y parece que le faltara algo a RUSH, además que sus nuevas canciones malas, nos han acostumbrado a cosas mucho mejores que las que trae el cd nuevo....Mal DVD para mí, lo recomendaría que lo compraran a las personas que les gusta coleccionar como yo artículos de RUSH, pero por más nada."
2,Live Blu-ray,Been a fan for years and I don't have any Concert Blu-ray's to compare. I read dozens of reviews before investing in this one to be disapointed. Maybe I was expected to be blow away. The picture looked crisp for a live concert. The sound seemed to be weak. What can I say other than I kept looking for other settings on my Denon to improve the sound. Something I never do when surfing the concert channels.
5,I love rush...but they are milking the live stuff,"I gave it a 5, i figure it will be good. But, I think they are milking the live stuff. Live albums are easy to produce. Suggestion? How about make a new album of new material! And record it live?"
1,"Wow, this is awful!","What an awful band. After this, I want to ""Rush"" to the nearest toilet and barf! LOL! That Geddy Li guy sounds like he's been sucking on way too many helium balloons, he sounds like a chipmunk! The drummer, Neil Pearl or something, is horrible. He only plays in 4/4 rhythm! He should take a cue or two from Lars Ulrich from the St. Anger album. Not to mention the lame guitar work and inaudible bass. Skip this generic classic rock junk and stick with the masters like Britney Spears."
5,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","By Far the best concert BluRay you will ever own. Sound quality is mind boggling. The concert footage is crystal clear. I've been to 12 RUSH concerts and this is as close to the real thing as you will get. ASTONISHING!!! Play it loud, it just gets better. The better the equipment the better the experience. The camera angles around Getty, Alex and especially Niel are fanominal. If you have any interest in RUSH buy it. If you looking for a Xmas gift for a Rush fan THIS IS IT!!!!!!!!!RRRUUUSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!RUSH: Snakes and Arrows Live [Blu-ray]"
3,audio/video not in sync,"Big Rush fan, first Blu-ray DVD, very disappointed! The video is great as is the audio, but many songs ( especially Neil's drum solo and Working them Angels) the video does not line up with the audio. Being a musician myself, it drives me crazy knowing this. Even if you are NOT a musician, you can see and hear that the two do not line up. Anyone else notice this same issue? It's not my player or system, because when I watch the Atlanta Bootlegs bonus material, it lines up just fine. At times if you watch the video screen behind the band it lines up perfectly, but if you watch the band the sound is about a 1/2 second BEHIND the video.Great DVD to have if you can get over the out of sync issue."
2,Audio and video are out of sync,"As a few others have mentioned, there's a split second timing difference between the video and the audio. This is particularly noticeable when watching Neil hit the snare drum. When the audio and video are out of sync, it completely ruins the viewing experience for me. I own about 20 concert Blu Ray discs, and haven't noticed this problem with the other concerts, so it appears to be just poor editing on the part of the folks who edited this particular show. Inexcusable."
5,Rush WOW!,"It's hard to believe that the Rush legacy not only continues but speaks to a new Generation. Fresh, fun, creative, intense and easy all at once. It's always as little difficult to understand genius. For the listener who has never noticed percussion, Pert delivers some of the tastiest drumming I've ever heard."
5,Unbelievable video and sound - Rush is in top form!,"This is an amazing DVD. I really feel like I am standing on stage when I watch this. The sound is better than the studio CD and the guys are in top form these days, for sure. Geddy is singing better than ever and writing really good vocal lines. The S&A; songs are very well written and live they take on a whole new life.I was on the 4th row in Alpharetta GA on the second leg of the tour (July 22nd, 2008) and that show was the best I'd ever seen, and thankfully also recorded in HD for the bonus disk.My favorite songs are the drum solo, of course, The Way the Wind Blows, Spindrift, and especially Armor and Sword - a perfect blend of 70's and early 80's Rush. These songs resonate emotionally and visually.I can't wait to get the Blu-Ray version.A must own!"
5,RUSH RULES,"I'm a huge Rush fan so, of course, it's awesome! I went to the show in Chicago on this tour and the DVD lives up to what I saw. Highly recommend this for any hardcore Rush collector."
5,Their best DVD yet!,"This is the best Rush concert DVD that I have and I have a lot of them. Great sound, visuals and an A+ performance. Rush on!!!"
5,Great DVD. Am must for your Blu-ray collection,"Fantastic DVD. If you have been watching the R30 concert being shown in HD on cable, buy this DVD. You will see what HD is supposed to look like. Not the highly compressed stuff cable and satellite are showing.I gave it 5 stars for the main program footage and menus. Be prepared that the archival bonus material on the DVD is not even close to the quality of the Snakes & Arrows concert. It is entertaining to watch so I am glad it is there, but is definitely lower quality. I guess if the main program did not look so good, it would not be so obvious."
5,"perfect example; give the fans what they want, awesome; except the video guy misses most of Neils key fills/drumming!","1) excellent, stellar audio mixing2) thanks Rush for giving us the 4 tracks from the second leg, and giving the fans what they want, not many bands do this, am grateful3)funny, can do without spendthreft off S&A;, funny the 4 songs not played are probably the best on the cd (i.e. Good News First....,,,)4)also, whoever is in charge of the video, you are missing Neil's best fills/drumming, not sure how you are doing him justice, totally surprising when you are focusing on the wrong member5) props to the audio engineer though...2nd to none, the 5.1 is superior to the pcm6)the bonus 4 songs from Atlanta,video guy got it right, unlike the main show; they should have just filmed the dvd in the states; hopefully next time!7) thanks again Rush for giving us the ENTIRE and COMPLETE show AND MORE!!!! unlike some other bands (i.e. Live):)"
5,You know it's good when.....,"...it's Rush!Yes, hundreds of thousands of fans turned out for both legs of the Snakes and Arrows tour and what a tour it was! True musicianship! Three true professionals doing what they love at their best - playing their music for their fans as only Rush can! I am so stoked and so excited! 221 minutes of one of the greatest rock bands of all time!So, to the naysayers, before you even begin... Yes, us Rush fans can grade this as a 5-star product before it is released because we know it is. Many of us experienced it in 2007 and 2008.Thank you Rush, for over 35 years of quality music and incredible shows!"
2,The guy responsible for mixing the sound should be shot.,"Great band, great performance, great music! All are wasted under a very very overcompressed audio mix...which may be why the bass sounds so thin. No actual dynamic range, everything is way loud...all the same volume...sucks the life and emotion out of the music. Might as well have used MP3 for mastering. DTS Master Audio...what a waste of MA! Rating would be 4 or 5 stars with a good mix."
5,Capture the moment,"If you were lucky enough to have seen a show form this tour and want to capture the essence of your experience, you can not go wrong with this purchase."
5,Amazing,"After All These Years,Still Playing For Three hours,And Sounding Better Than Anyone Live! This Is A Must Have"
4,Much better than RIO...Some sound issues though,"Geddy is the man on bass- he rips through the songs with the greatest of ease. Alex and Neil are awesome too. The song choice is good featuring some gems like Mission, Circumstances, Between the Wheels and A Passage to Bangkok. There are some times when Alex's guitar drowns everyone out. But then again, I've seen them live several times and this has always been the case at times. Overall, I would recommend. The Snake and Arrows songs are pretty good too especially Armor and Sword. It's great that these guys are ""Endlessly Rockin'"" !"
1,Buyer Beware!,"Phil Elmore is widely known as a hack when it comes to martial arts. Before you buy this book, I suggest you do some research on the author at Wikipedia or your favorite search engine.While I think in general knowing a little self defense is important, learning it from this book is likely to get you hurt or killed. Should you actually need to defend yourself, the training offered in this book is of little to no value when it comes to fighting or self-defense...but looks really cool showing off to friends who don't know any better.In today's litigious society, I wouldnt be surprised if someone actually tried these techniques in a real-world application, got hurt..and sued Mr. Elmore.Mr. Elmore should actually learn how to fight, and show that his techniques will work before anyone will take him seriously.I won't comment on the section about homeless people, as it has absolutely nothing to do with self defense...merely Mr. Elmore attempting some sort of social commentary."
1,"Short of Experience, Empty Head","One of the most inspiring martial arts books on the market. I mean, where else can you pay money for the self-proclaimed expertise of a fat white man with a doo rag who speaks Latin and whose main claim to martial arts expertise is dropping out of wing chun after 2 years? I mean, this is inspiring like all of those anti-drug commercials. Don't do drugs. Stay in school. Don't start your own websites with long-winded articles and Latin references. Keep training."
1,Terrible,"Zero experience in anything other than being ""an average guy who likes to think [he] can understand average people.""What expertise am I paying for again?"
1,what the heck?,"I bought this book based on some discussion I overheard. I thought it would be great insight into a new method - and perhaps add to my own game. I was disgusted by this book. I'm led to believe this is some sort of satire on real martial arts because every picture seems comical and every technique seems misinformed. From reading other peoples reviews it appears Mr. Elmore has no credentials to begin with!Save yourself the trouble, this book is not worth the money and you're better off finding a book that will actually teach you something usefull and not insult your intelligence and waste your time."
1,Would you learn to cook from someone who can't boil water?,"That's what this really boils down to...The worthwhile advice you can find in this book can be learned with a google search or a look over places like E-Budo or MAP..The rest.. This many has no real training, no real experience, no real first hand knowledge of any martial art barring his failed years at Wing Chun.Which is the point. If someone inferred that they had 15 years of experience as a chef but needed help boiling water.. Isn't that dishonest? Mr. Elmore meets the same situation with his combat skills."
3,Is this really the end?????,"Okay, as a book, it was great. But as a conclusion, i thought it [stunk]. lol. ok it wasn't TERRIBLE, but it left a lot of questions unanswered. like, what about that creepy techer?? and the group therepy leader?? and what about the guy in jail who knew rae's mom was melissa?? and do they really think that yanas not gonna go phsyco again?? So if this book wasn't the conclusion, i definetaly would have liked it better. But there were good parts in the book, like when rae and anthony were together. they seem so in to each other its sooo cute! But overall, i was kinda dissapointed that melinda metz finished such a good series with such a dissapointing book."
5,Great thrilling ending to a great series,"Taking straight off from the last book when Rae got the shock of her life that her best friend Yana was really the one after her all this time, it seems ideal that that she is having a normal life again with Yana now in prison. She can get through her high school years like a normal teen and get over her awkward fingerprint reading ability. And she can finally be with Anthony...However when Aiden shows up and tells Rae that Yana had escaped from prison her life is turned upside down all over again. Rae knows that Yana is her biggest threat to happiness but is Yana after Rae? Or after the agency?I really liked the conclusion to the great Fingerprints series. I wish though that there were more books because it truly is a good series and there were more storyline. However this is an ideal ending!"
3,The End?,"In this episode, Yana escapes from a dentist's office (don't ask me) and goes back to Atlanta in search of revenge.Once again, I loved the parts where Anthony and Rae were together (sigh). But is this the end of the series? What about freaky Mr. Jefferson and that strange, over-concerned woman who is Rae's group therapy leader? And how does the author expect me to believe that Yana, who is clearly a psycho, will suddenly turn all normal-y once she gets her ""revenge?""For a conclusion, this book was pretty weak, but I do have to add that I can't wait for Metz's next series--she's a really good author."
5,payback fingerprints # 7,i liked it because everyone in the book came together in the end to help each other out.
5,this is the best series ever!,"i love this series, rae is always in some kind of relationship glitch but i love to c them work out! she has the perfetc bf rite under her nose and she dosent even realize it! this book is so exicting, once u finish the first book ullo kant wai til u get the next one!"
1,Bad quality,Desk had manufacture defect on top and replacement parts had same defect front pull out had weak hinges so wont stay up would never buy from this company again
2,Desk top with huge crack!,I'm sorry to say but I just received the desk (in 2 boxes) and the desk top has a huge crack along the side of it and on the underside. I have just requested a replacement top and hope for better results than the last reviewer who had a similar situation. The desk is very attractive and will take several hours to put together with less than perfect directions.Update - as of 8/26/12 no response from the seller regarding the damaged desk top. Downgraded 1 star due to lack of response. Sent second email and waiting for response.
4,Creepy People,"I enjoyed watching Meadowoods, & was struck by how CREEPY these three perps were! The movie introduces the three kids, portrayed by excellent unknown actors, and takes us down a sometimes plodding road to the ending we are dreading: their cold-blooded killing of their victim - an excellent Ila Schactler. The sequence from inside the box, with its lit/unlit squirming and frantic action had me feeling for the victim. The end seemed abrupt, and I wanted the movie to show more of the effects of this deed on the three murderers. One thing's for sure - I'll never forget Kayla freaking-out being buried alive!Also, I didn't like the hand-held camera effects too much - got feeling a little queasey after a while. My wife liked the movie, and the camera motion didn't bother her at all!"
1,Meadowoods,"This was a stupid, sick movie. I have to admit, I absolutely hated the three college students. Especially, the blonde guy and girl (Travis & Stephanie). I couldn't wait for them to get what was coming to them. In the end the conclusion left me unfulfilled. There really was no conclusion. The other thing is the long drawn out death scene in the box. Which can't be really called a death scene because most of the time it was just a dark, blank screen. In any case. I hate the two actors I mentioned before, even though I know they were just acting. I'm so sick of individuals that think they can take other peoples lives with no consequences. And yes, I know this is a movie; it just reminds me of all the 'real' sick and disguting people in the world.P.S> Get Bent!!!!!"
1,Pretty bad,"I rented this movie thinking it would be a guilty pleasure horror flick to enjoy. I was wrong and should have gone with my first impulse to turn it off 5 minutes in. The movie was slow, unimaginative, and just plain bad. The dialog and characters were beyond stupid. There was nothing, absolutely nothing scary about it. That's how bad it is."
1,Ughhh!,"NOT another handheld, let me show you my face closeup film (well essentially two faces and cameos by victim and camera holder) located in who cares suburb (well mostly in some back yard) with a piggy bank budget (well two piggy banks - maybe) unsuspenseful film.Spoiler: Girl dies in box but you get to see a half hour of her kicking the box from her feet view."
3,Not enough space for lap top,"I loved the lap top case as it had compartments for all my supplies. I had to send it back though because I have an Alien lap top and it did not fit right in the Alien lap top carrier. I had to force it in the carrier. I did not want to scratch my lap top so I am looking for something with more space. If you have a small lap top, 14 or 15 inch, this would be perfect."
4,Great Bag,"This bag is excellent. Lots of pockets and great quality material. It is however a little bulky, so if you have a small laptop, you may want to look for something smaller. Also, it is a casual bag, so it's not so good if you're thinking of buying a bag that you can take to the office."
3,Not the best for a 17 inch screen.,"Nice product, but my 17 inch alienware laptop does not fit in the designated area, and when i force it, it is near impossible to get the computer back out.You can put it in the inside of the bag, outside of the laptop compartment, but this keeps you from being able to use all the little compartments, for fear of smashing their contents or scratching up your computer.If you say it will fit a 17 inch laptop, it should fit."
3,Nice Bag,Its a nice bag and does what you want it to do. Carries a lot of things that you need to carry around. So i would recommend getting this if you want somethign to old your nice alienware notebook like me =)
3,Dose what I need,Very well written story. Would recommend this to everyone. I've enjoyed this author for many years. You will have a great adventure with this story.
4,A pleasant surprise!,"This is the first novel of Patricia Potter's novels that I've read, although I have browsed the covers of a few, but deemed them too far on the 'romance' scale for my liking.This book was such a pleasant surprise. The suspense angle is really good, the story well told and interesting. I would definitely class this novel up with Tess Gerritsen, Lisa Garder, Lisa Jackson etc, and I'm hoping she'll concentrate more in the thriller/suspense/mystery genre in the future. It will certainly encourage me to take a further look at her other titles."
5,Great Romantic Suspense,"Afraid of her powerful senator husband, Holly runs away with her son to Arizona. Leary of others and fearing her husband will find her she sets up a new life. Meanwhile, she tries to absorb the news from her dying mother that she has a half-sister somewhere and she needs to find her. What should she do?There are two stories here: Holly and the sheriff, Randolph, and Gage and Meredith. Lots of twists and turns but Patricia pulls it off and it was tastefully done. I recommend this book!"
3,Interesting Enough,"This book is the first Pat Potter book's I have read. It is well written and usually entertaining, however, I did feel that it was very predictable. Does have a good mix of romanace and mystery. Worth the read if you are looking for a mystery/romamce/drama mix."
5,Bravo!,Excellent playing. These guys show us that Italy is still at the center of the music world. I especially like the first tune and the drummer has a lot of things happening.
1,Not comfortable!,"I was excited when I found these sexy shoes but I had to return them. The footbed was very narrow and I have a narrow foot! My toes hung off the sides. Too, the leather up around your foot was very stiff."
3,"Good, but a bit juvenille","I'm writing this for my 12 year old daughter who says:This is good, but it can get a bit cheesy. Lots of corny jokes. I don't regret buying it, bit I think it could have been better. It also won't make sense at all if you haven't read the first book."
1,horrible story,"i have read many many many many many books. most of them are fantasy. this book is absolutely horrid and i have no idea why this can even be called a book and be bought.i thought it would be a good story but it dissapointed me very greatly.i only consider this book as a waste of money.so anybody out there who is looking for a good story? don't choose this ""book"""
1,needs a lot of work,"Like I said in my title,IT NEEDS WORK!!! At the beginning of the book it just starts off really boring, & it is really hard to keep up on who's talking and thinking because there are chapters on Emily and then Mandy. Which is which??? Plus, I think the author shouldn't have put in Mandy-Chapters. 100% no for me"
2,Fearful and NO fun,"We read the first book in the series and loved it. It was fun, no major violence or stress compared to many books in the same genre. Light, enjoyable reasding. I bought the second and third books expecting more of the same. WOW. What a disappointment!! This entire book finds Emily and her peers depressed, stressed, worried about fitting in all the time, and in high levels of fear throughout. It was awful. I won't be buying the fourth book, or anything else from this author."
5,Better Than the First,"I have to admit this book is far better than ""The Tail of Emily Windsnap""; the first book in the series. If you read my review on the first book you would know how highly I thought of that book, making this a huge success. Again, the author is a master of making everything seem real and believable. Nothing is out of place or overly fantasized. The story sucks you in and won't spit you out until it is over. The book may not have some great moral, but it is entertaining and magical. If you have read the first book this is a sequel you won't wanna miss. If you haven't than it's a necessity that you do, although you have to come back to this one afterwards. It captures your imagination and is part mystery. This novel is filled with suspense and curiosity making unknowns. Not too predictable. Not at all scary. I would recommend this to anyone who likes mystery, fantasy, or adventure novels."
4,Better story than the first,"Unlike ""The Tail of Emily Windsnap"", this story was not as predictable. It had a lot more left to the imagination and gave the reader a chance to guess what might happen next. Also, the story goes back and forth between two different points of view. I think this adds a lot to the reading. It makes you want to read the next one!"
3,very good cd,"Very good cd, that pleases to see the Queen's legend so well reinterpreted by of so good artists! He is very good, the interpretation also"
1,Honestly I hated it!,"We used this high chair from the time my son was 5 months until he turned 10 months. I had so many issues with this chair! The tray is huge and did not fit in my dishwasher. It was also heavy and required both hands to manuever. There was a huge gap between the tray and my son's chest, which means that half the food fell into his lap, or worse, got stuck in the crevices of the chair. I was constantly cleaning this chair and hunting for a tool to get the filthy straps off. At 10 months, when the pediatrician said it was time to start letting my son self-feed, I knew we had to replace the chair. We chose the Fisher Price Heathy Care Booster seat and I love it! Other people may like this chair, but I am just being honest with you regarding our experience with this chair. I wish I had not wasted my money on it!"
1,This Highchair is AWFUL!!!!!!!,"This highchair is absolutely terrible!!!! It is so difficult to clean and no matter what we do to it, it never seems to be clean. It has so many crevices where food can hide and unless your baby is a very clean eater, this is not the chair to buy. Also, the pad of the chair is very difficult to remove and reattach and it seems as though our fingers are always getting pinched trying to do so.Positive notes - Nice reclining feature, harness and easy tray removal, however these features can probably be found on another high chair.I will probably get a new highchair for my next child as this one is such a pain! Yuck, do not buy!"
4,Love It!!,"I too read the reviews and was a little worried, but ya know what???? I love this chair. The heights are adjustable and my daughter is comfortable in it. I do take some points off for the tray that is not close enough but can deal with this (in my opinion nothing is perfect). As far as cleaning is concerned, I just wipe it with a wet cloth and go on my merry way! I recommend this product!"
2,The Smelliest chair in town...,"In a nutshell, I bought this chair because it looked attractive in our kitchen and I thought it would be very comfortable and safe. There is, however, no conceivable way to get this thing clean! Even with daily wiping down and disassembling, the chair has developed an odor from food getting caught in the straps and crevices. The tan leatherette has begun to deteriorate and crack after only 5 months! We must take it outside and hose down the frame weekly to keep down the colony of fruit flies that have taken up residence there. In short, it is a disgusting chair and I am even more disgusted that I paid $180 for it. I would not recommend this chair to anyone."
2,Not for young infants,"I agree with another reviewer that this high chair is best for babies 12 months+. We registered for this high chair and I am impressed with its stability, quality and design except for the fact that the tray is so large that my 5 month old can't see over it. She drowns in this high chair! I was disappointed that this chair did not have an adjustment where the tray can be lowered so that infants can fit comfortably in it. I think we will not be able to use this chair until my daughter is about a year old. :("
2,Hannah's Mommy,"This chair is way too big. My baby is 10 months and I have her sitting on a book so she can reach the tray, and she's still too low. Plus, there is way too much room between the baby and the tray. I purchased a Fisher Price chair for my Mom which was 1/3 the price and I like it much better!"
2,"Expensive, and...","...very, very hard to clean. There are cheaper high chairs on the market now with similar features. Don't be fooled into paying more for the Perego name. It's just not worth it."
4,Fun for the family,"I read this recently with my 2nd grader. The cover on this looked like so much fun I figured I'd give it a try. I was afraid my 7 year old would be too too young for these stories but he LOVED them. We're also very excited to have found a new author that we really like -- David Lubar! ""Are too, are not, R2-D2"" a line from Lubar's story which is constantly recited at our house. We also really enjoyed the mini author bios at the end of each story."
5,A Fascinating Read,"My earliest memory was Hurricane Donna, and I have been intrigued by hurricanes ever since. This book offers a considerable amount of historical data along with fascinating accounts. Highly recommended to anybody who would like to learn more about the history of hurricanes in Florida."
3,Decent old text,"The book apparently was supposed to have some pictures or drawings but they are not in the downloaded book? The content lists them and links to the location but there is nothing but the captions.On the brighter side, the text in this book is pretty decent and good reading, although it is way out of date (early 20th century I believe), but many of the author's views on bird conservation, ecology, and such lik, is still valid and worth reading today. His style is enjoyable and thought provoking. Bottom line, for a free-be its worth downloading and reading.3 stars because pictures are lacking."
4,Out of print Iggy EP,"Cool EP single by Iggy, featuring ""Livin' On the Edge of the Night"" (from the motion picture soundtrack of ""Black Rain""), and 3 more of his best 80's album tracks: ""Lust For Life"", ""China Girl"", ""The Passenger""."
4,Great CD for DJ's to mix with!,"This CD has a few bubble-gum-type songs but there are some nice cuts on this CD. Also, this is an awesome CD to use for remixes, etc. This CD came out just before hip-hop went crazy in the mainstream/pop market. It's got some funky grooves and nice harmonies, if I do say so myself. ;)"
2,I have a headache,"Picking up this album gave me a good feeling, after all I'd liked Port Royal and loved Death or Glory, so figured I'd take a chance on them. Bad move.OK, to specifics - this album is like walking through mudflats at low tide. There are a couple of occasions where the lyrics or the music picks up, but really what weighs this release under is the combination of so-so production and also the feeling that everyone knew that Death or Glory had been their artistic and commercial highpoint, and that there was nothing more to look forward to.Which is a pity as I always had a soft spot for this band. My tip is to get Death or Glory. It's excellent. Then explore further out from there."
2,Very High Level Overview,"This book should only be purchased by those individuals that have just heard the letters S, A, and P all in a row for the first time. If you have absolutely no idea what SAP is, have no idea what an ERP is, or your company is still using punch cards, then this book is for you."
3,A good overview...,"This book is obviously a bit outdated but since finding good books giving you an overview of SAP is so hard, it may still be worth having a look at this one.I bought this before starting a project as coordinator of data migration and found it gave me some good insights.As mentioned though, a bit outdated."
3,Elephants & Extras,"Set in the wilderness of Africa and featuring real animals who express themselves with human voices, Whispers follows the misadventures of an elephant calf named Whispers (Debi Derryberry) who gets separated from his mother (voiced by Anne Archer). In his desperate search to find her, he hooks up with a pessimistic pachyderm with some junk in the trunk. Her name is Groove (Angela Bassett), and in spite of her loner mindset she decides to help the little one in his plight.I saw this movie when it aired on TV, and I found it pretty boring. However, I think kids will enjoy the story and the locations are quite beautiful. There aren't many extras on the DVD, but it's worth a look if you think you'll enjoy the scenery."
5,Awesome and very touching movie for all ages,"This is one of the most awesome and heartwarming movies I've seen, with a great moral to the story. I loved everything about this movie. It is educational, funny, touching, and the music is really cool. This movie is recommended for every boy and girl and also the adults who still ""have a heart"" and are touched by warm, good stories with a happy ending. We would ""cough up water"" for this movie. Watch it, better yet - buy a copy, you won't regret it and your children surely won't."
1,Killing Elphants 5 minutes into the movie!!!,"I read other reviews that said this was a great family movie. I bought the movie for my two year old who loves elephants more than anything in the world. I thought that I had finally found a movie with actual elephants (not animation) that had a good wholesome plot, I was sorely mistaken. Five minutes into the movie there are poachers who start shooting and killing Whisper's mother and other elephants within the herd. I thought my wife was going to shoot me when we were all watching this in the family room! It may be a good movie but it was made for an older audience."
2,I love it but kids does not like it much.,I love the whole story but kids does not like it much. but they watched it till end. I like to recommend it for 6-7yrs old
2,Didn't like at all.,I have little boys and I did not appreciate the overall language and attitude of the film. From the very start it had rude and fowl language. Was a world away from the traditional Disney film! I only watched the first few minutes with my son and then put it where it belonged...IN THE TRASH!
3,Good introduction to socialism,"This book is essentially classic socialist thought bundled into a story, all be it a story based closely on the life of the author. Half biography, half political philosophy course in socialism the Ragged trousered Philanthropists somehow works as a novel. The plot is interesting but tedious at times, the dialog is spot on and the atmosphere is brilliant. This is no doubt due to the personal experience of the author.It is very preachy, a no holds barred attack against capitalism and a shockingly biased view of socialism. But it's a brilliant way to find out about Socialsim, at times inspiring and delving deep into minds of those who wish for change.The book is very good, worth four stars maybe. I gave it three because of the text book feel it generates at times."
5,It made the second time all that much better,At my first wedding I was embarrassing on the dance floor. I wasn't going to make that same mistake in my second. This DVD made all the difference. It was easy to follow and gave me the basic skills I needed to have confidence on the dance floor. And it was fun learning with my fiancée. My friends noticed a huge difference.
2,not for us...,"This just wasn't for us. It is more if you want to learn ballroom dancing. Its not casual dancing at all, very formal. The instructors are okay, but they move kinda quick if you are a first timer with no experience. Not bad, just not for us!"
4,exactly as expected- nice photo album,"nice red leather photo album. Perfect as a keepsake item for business. Comes shipped in a nice blue gift box.Delivered extremely quickly! I received it in 48 hours, with no special shipping.I will say that the vendor has a lack of communication- I never received an email from them saying ""Thank you for your order"" or a shipping confirmation or any sort of tracking number. A little more attention to communicating to their customers would be appreciated, but I can't really complain- I got the item right away, in good condition.The photo album pages are not quite to the same high standard as the leather- the sheets are a little think and less than translucent and don't show off the pictures to their best, but it's not enough for me to go looking for replacement pages."
2,Difficut to see,"I purchased this for my mother and she was very pleased with the size and the leather cover, however she felt that the plastic pages were not clear and did not allow one to see the photos very well."
4,I should probably give it 5 stars,"This cap fits 2007 and 2008 Toyota FJ Cruisers, even though the description didn't say it would. The key sometimes is a little difficult to get in, but I suspect that has more to do with the dirty muddy dusty conditions I drive in, so I probably should give it 5 stars. It works as it is supposed to and has kept people from stealing my fuel."
3,"It fits my 2000 Camry LE, but barely.","The spring in my old fuel cap popped off, and I was driving around without the part that was designed to hold those vapors inside of the tank. This caused my engine light to come on today. So I had to get a replacement cap.I like the fact that it locks, but the bulky part of the unit causes my gas door to not snap shut as well as it did previously. It still closes, but not as easily and securely as it did with my old cap. I can tell the difference.You may want to buy the regular fuel cap (Stant 10834 for a 2000 Toyota Camry LE 4 cylinder engine) if you thnk this will be a problem for you. My car has a gas cap door that can only be opened by pulling the little trigger inside of the car. So it really didn't benefit me so much to have the lock.My only question is whether rain water will drain down behind the door due to the extra space. I just bought it today, so I will see...."
1,"Nice spoon, larcenous pricing","This $18.75 item is not a set of spoons, it is a single spoon. Just one. Consider for a moment: for ~$50 you can get a five place setting; that's less than three times the price, for which you get five of these exact same spoons and -- at no additional charge -- 10 forks, 5 larger spoons and 5 knives.The annoying thing is that I contacted the MANUFACTURER who stated that a single spoon had a MSR of $6.75, which lead me to believe that an $18.75 item would be multiple spoons (maybe 4, maybe 5 -- who knew?). But no -- this is just a ludicrous, near larcenous markup.Save your money, get the set. Throw away what you don't need!"
4,the best so far,"well, this is the third in the series and i really really liked it. i think it's the best so far - but i've lots left to go! the relationship between meredith and alan is the glue that keeps you wanting to go immediately on to the next book, but the mysteries are good in themselves."
4,Another good one!,"Although I read this book a bit out of sequence since I read the next one first, I still really enjoyed this. I love the Meredith Mitchell and Alan Markby series, and I'm glad that this is only the beginning of the series, since I still have a lot of books to read yet. I can't wait to see the relationship develop between these two. This book brings Meredith back to Bamford for a week while she house-sits for Markby's sister's family, and throws her into Alan's investigation into a body found buried in the earth right where a development for houses is being built. Of course, Meredith can't resist doing some investigation on her own. A whole series of a family's secrets come out during the course of the investigation. For English Village Mysteries, they don't get much better than this or any of Ms. Granger's books."
2,Reprint of 1945 publication,"This volume is a reprint of original 1945 publication, and appears to be a photo-offset production. Following the custom of the time, words are shown only in romaji, no kana or kanji. It could be of interest only to linguists studying the changes in the Japanese language over the last 65 years"
3,A book redeemed by the illustrations,"This book is varied in its approach. It gives a summary of the 1812 campaign with selected anecdotes on campaign and logistics issues thrown in, then covers broadly the composition of the armies involved. Nice assortment of pictures, but if you are looking for a text on the 1812 Russian campaign, this is not it. The text has a cut-and-paste feel.Probably aimed at wargamers."
1,copycat?,There once was a man by the name of Otto von Pivka. He wrote Armies of 1812 and Armies of the Napoleonic Wars. Did Smith ever hear of him?
5,Cantoma,"I just played the Cantoma CD twice this morning since receiving it and it is absolutely THE most wonderful electronica CD I have - and I have many.This CD has already sent me on a quest for another Cantoma type CD. For anyone new to Chill, Lounge or electronica music please buy this one. You will fall in love with the music and devote some of your spare time looking for CD's just like this one."
5,A beautiful knife to the heart,"After recovering from the buzzsaw guitar wash of ""Sweet Heart Dealer"" we get nearly two years later this surprise of an album from these LA darlings. Yes, the spectre of MBV does loom over the guitar work but the sound is cleaner (though still raw in its urgency) thereby revealing the melodic flow. The oversll production reveals the bass to hold the center of songs so that thte guitars can wash over one another instead of coalescing into a dissonant buzz. They hum instead of roaring. And the songs? Still littered with moments of disappointment, bleak and stark relationships and hopelessness but swirling around an amalgam of sound that's part Cure, MBV, Jack Off Jill, Joy Division and Jesus and Mary Chain. Best moments are City Noise, Bummer (neat chorus and hook), Manorexic, Stapled to the Mattress and the title tune. This is music that will rip your soul from its blood soaked foundations and having you thank them for it."
4,get this cd,since jack off jill disbanded i have missed good heavy rock but now scarling is here while not as hard as joj its still amazing excellant lyrics and melodies will leave you very happy
5,A Dark Melodic Mix,"Me being a Jack Off Jill fan, When i heard that Scarling was finally coming out w/this cd i wondered if it would be worth the hype. So many bands say they want to have a different sound and then they sound awful. This is not the case w/this cd. It blends together in a dark melodic mix that most Jack Off Jill fans will find refreshing."
3,Um....,"Okay. I am a huge fan of Jack off Jill. I love pretty well everything they've ever done. Obviously then, I know of Scarling, and up until now i've liked them very much. I adored the first EP (Bandaid Covers the Bullet Hole) and LP (Sweet heart Dealer) but I just can't get into this. I've tried, so hard, but I simply don't like this album. Please be extremely wary of purchasing this album: it's not like anything that came before it. There's no heaviness, and much as i hate to admit it, it's kind of boring. Listen to it first. If you just rush in and buy this, you'll probably regret it."
3,Maybe I liked the first album a bit too much....,"So Long, Scarecrow sounds nothing like Sweet heart dealer. This disapointed me. Now don't get me wrong. It's absolutely beautiful, calming and I can relate to the emotions that Jessicka expresses. Her voices is so pure and angelic. The lyrics are amazing...but the songs sound to similar to me. On Sweet heart dealer each song sounded completely different from the last. I absolutely adored that. It hard nowadays to find bands that can do that."
5,"""We Bleed like no one else""","Dear So long Scarecrow,Since I was first lucky enough to hear your gorgeous, pink, bloody tracks, I have been in love. In love with you. You have made me recollect happy, brutal often painful memories, you have made me laugh, been there to comfort me when I cried, you have been the painful past, and my amazing future.When I listen to you I hear Mark Ryden inspired bunnies, candy covered razor blades, everything I've ever needed.Thankyou, So long scarecrow, for, without you, I wouldn't be who I am today, you will always be my love, no matter what ever happens.(oh, by the way by the album, retard >___> )"
5,Great album start to finish!,"This is a great well made album i have heard in a very long time. Great vocals, drums, bass, and guitar. This should be album of the year in my opinion. Buy the thing and tell your friends."
2,"""Scarecrow"" less than sum of its parts.","The biggest surprise of Scarling's new album is the unexpected lack of imagination and identity contained in the thirteen tracks on offer. Consisting largely of the sort of sonic dirges which are the bread and butter of My Bloody Valentine et al, ""Scarecrow"" seems content to plod along this well worn track without adding anything new to the genre and failing to ignite with the patented Scarling energy.While still being a strong effort and an accomplished album, the overall lethargy and lack of inventiveness leaves less to love about ""So Long, Scarecrow"" than Scarling's previous, superior, release ""Sweet Heart Dealer."""
1,Simply beautiful!!,"I expected great things from Scarling!! the first Album was so good i couldnt wait for the next!!! I was not let down!! it was great, i listen to it all the time!!! this album wont leave my CD player for a long time!!! its simply beautiful!!"
4,"beautiful work, scarling.!","well, first off i'd like to say that i absolutely love this cd. jessicka's gorgeous vocals mix perfectly with the drums, distorted bass and the guitars in the back, which also contribute so much to each and every song. you can definitely tell there's been a lot of effort put into their music, because it shows. there's something unique and lovely about every track on the album, i can't chose a favourite. it's pure beauty in the form of music. scarling. will leave you either smiling, crying, will chills up your spine... or all three. :)"
4,"So Long, Scarecrow","So Long, Scarecrow is unleashed. It has burst out of the depths &is; currently stealing countless minds of countless listeners that are willing to open their minds to the numbingly beautiful sound that scarling. produces.The sonic distortion on the opening track ['hello london'] beats on the ears leaving an incredibly strong impression in such a short time period. This is followed by the first single 'City Noise' - an airy, upbeat song aimed to refresh and invigorate. It leaves the listeners gasping for more.Erratic and melodic, So Long Scarecrow has the power to depress or enhance any mood. It maintains it's eerie aura of neither discomfort nor comfort; as if stuck in a musical purgatory.The prominent bass hooks mixed with the sweetness &sincerity; of Jessicka's [vocalist] voice, combines to form a classic must-have album."
1,Big If--Big Waste,"Mark Costello is clearly an accomplished wordsmith, using his skill to create an edgy, appealing style. I only wish he had used his talent to create at least one character that I cared about, for better or worse. As it was, half way through this book, I was wishing to drown myself in the characters many pools of self-pity. At least that would have brought the book to an end. Pages are wasted on non-action, such as describing in detail the technical aspects of a computer game that really has nothing to do with the plot. Wait a minute. This novel doesn't really have a plot. For me, the Big If was a big waste."
1,Big If,"This is probably one of the worst novels I've ever read. I read the whole book, hoping it would get better, it didn't. The story was weak and disjointed. None of the Secret Service agents were people any of us would want to be around. In describing the Secret Service, the author did little if any research. All of the agent's titles and the terms used for investigative and protective assignments were not even close to being correct.In fact the only thing the author got right was the name of the agency. A little research on line or in a library would have given they story a little more credability."
1,Beyond Boring,I read the first 20 pages of this snorer and couldn't continue. NOTHING happens! Why would I consider reading on? What's the first rule of writing a compelling novel? GRAB THE READER ON THE FIRST PAGE! This book never did. I'm not sure how people can rave about the great writing - it just isn't there.
1,a cynical author who hates animals,"I decided to give this book a chance, but wish I hadn't. The author has a hateful attitude toward animals that is simply offensive. That, combined with his extreme cynicism, really prevented me from enjoying the book. Not recommended."
3,"Great Character Development, Nearly Nonexistent Plot","If you're looking for a page turner about secret service agents, look elsewhere. But if you're interested in a well-written collection of barely connected anecdotes, you'll enjoy this book. Despite the surprising lack of plot, I was fascinated with the characters and disappointed when the story ended. Tack on another 100 pages or so of actual plot, or at least an ending that didn't feel like an afterthought (the key character in the climax is one you learn almost nothing about), and the book would have been outstanding."
3,almost...,"This good book would have been better IF:1) The only character who really mattered, Naubek, had been dealt with in as great a detail as a real-estate agent, a potential hippy assassin who is whacked out and Lydia Felker, who I saw as Ruth Buzzy from Laugh In.2) The Lloyd Felker story line was a bit more clear. I actually wasn't sure if he was alive or dead.3) The writer, a fine one, worried a little more about his readers and less about his literary intentions.Actually, I don't feel as if I wasted my precious reading time. Costello did a great job of developing characters, except Naubek. But, after some reviews I read, I was expecting much more. I thought the Commissariat of the Enlightenment was superior."
2,not worth your time,"I am in a state of disbelief that The Economist or the New York Times could give this book a glowing review. I kept waiting for something interesting to kick in, but it rarely did. To be fair, the last ten pages was a creative bit of writing, but the first 350 pages just droned on and on. Additionally, I found the writing, itself, to be nothing special. There are some authors who are such great work smiths that it almost doesn't matter what they are saying, the reader can simply get great joy in the way they say it. This is not one of those authors. I felt much of the dialog was written in a rather immature, unrealistic way. I kept finding myself saying, ""Come on, no would actually say that."" There are so many great books out there to read, I would definately tell a friend to take a pass on this one."
2,poor langugee and critical errors,This book presents some good materials. Two big designs can be used with some careful. The language used is poor. The language structure is confusing and the user might need to read a paragraph several times to understand the Author. I think some of the materials were translated from another language to English without any thought.There are some critical design errors. For example he uses this equation to detect an overflow when he treats the THUMB cpu: V_Flag <= (ALU_out[`WORD_SIZE] != ALU_out[`WORD_SIZE-1]);The condition is wrong and causes any conditional branch to fail. I challenge the Author if he tested the RTL code before publishing his book.I think a second edition is needed. I was expecting to have better quality for the money I paid.
2,Not Cohesive,"If you're interested in an exhaustive collection of the Christmas Tree Ship's story, this is a good book for you. It contains a lot of information. Unfortunately, it is not very cohesive, so it does not read well. It jumps in various directions about different aspects of the story, so it doesn't flow very well."
4,The Throes of Violence,"Lucky Dime Liquors has been burned to the ground. Manny Massman, the owner, cries. National Guardsmen are present in Watts. Easy Rawlins has his office over the shop of a cobbler. He has kept himself inside, filled with pent-up rage.Detective Melvin Suggs seeks him out. Rawlins fought in a segregated army. Now there is an angry voice in his heart. A white man may have choked and killed Nola Payne. Nola was trying to save him. He was being chased by rioters. Rawlins is starting to feel a connection between himself and the people caught up in the throes of violence.Easy Rawlins is forty-five years old. Mouse is a serious man who has killing in his blood. Easy had to remove him from his telephone listing. Being the friend of Raymond Alexander, (Mouse), gives Easy access to the neighbors of the dead woman. Easy is trying to carry out an investigation for the LAPD who fear official action will result in more rioting. Easy learns that Nola had been an organized woman."
4,Solid Easy Rawlins Outing,"This is a good solid read, set during the LA riots from the mid-sixties. The characters are nicely fleshed out, and the explorations into race relations are painful and fascinating. The underlying murder plot is almost secondary to the insights of Rawlins on the intermeshed lives of blacks and whites in America. Definitely worth buying in hardcover."
2,Disappointment in Mosley,"I've enjoyed all of Mosley's works until Little Scarlet. Instead of moving the plot along in any logical way, he jumps from place to place with no real purpose. The whole scene with the wrong Harold did little to amuse or reveal.Easy's failure to call friends or cohorts to tell them he'll be delayed for days seems inexplicably rude. Mouse no longer has the electricity he once did. The reader does not believe that Easy is frightened of Mouse.Much of the plot seems unrealistic, with lots of loose ends. Mosley needed a better editor. I'm truly disappointed."
5,Mosley has a unique knack for dialogue,"I don't know why I stopped reading Walter Mosley about a dozen years ago. I think it was after seeing the disappointing film version of ""Devil in a Blue dress"" (though it did introduce me to Don Cheadle). I sure am glad I picked up Little Scarlett though. I have to catch up with the last several Easy Rawlins stories now. He is such a quick read and Easy has such a wonderful take on humanity. When I think of Mosley, I think of Elmore Leonard. They both have these rich characters with such snappy dialogue, but Leornard has written a lot of average books amongst his masterpieces. Mosley's work has all been excellent. Little Scarlett is probably the best. At least of the ones I've read so far. Like I say I have some catching up to do. Nice to rediscover an old friend."
3,A fast- perfect for the summer- read.,"I felt like I'd been reading some pretty heavy books lately, and wanted a kind of quick crime novel for the weekend. This one hit the spot.Little Scarlet is an Easy Rawlins novel. The first one that I've read. Easy Rawlins is a black man living in LA in the 1960's. He is officially a building manager for a middle school, but he does a lot of what he calls ""Research and Delivery"". This time, the cops come to him to do some gumshoeing where they cannot, as this novel takes place immediately after the Watts 1965 Race Riots.Check out my blog at [...] for a full review!"
3,Cute but not durable,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter who absolutley loves the play food sets, and I am actually disapointed in this set because the quality of the the play ice cream is not very good and my daughter broke one of the spoons in 1 day of owning it because they were so thin..I know this set is not going to last very long because it is not durable enough to deal with a 2 year olds play habbits,but other than the problems with this set my daughter actually enjoys the set she is making me and my husband sundae's like crazy so if you are going to buy this set be cautious and think about how your children play first so you dont have to eventually take away something liked by your child"
5,bare escentuals eye sahadow,"I was using Celestine, which is about two shades lighter, and my absolute fave - perfect for any eye color, but was looking for something to intensify my look.... This adds the perfect brown-based, plummy/purple, charcoal. Great alone, or added to the lash line/lid to enbolden my fave Celestine. Everyone in my office has noticed the difference, and complimented it. Perfedt for BOOSTING you every-day routine."
4,Queen Phyllis eye shadow,"Queen Phyllis was the closest colour to the eye shadow I was looking for (City lights) and I wondered perhaps if the name had been changed because Amazon did not show that City Lights was available. I purchased it and received it quickly but found it was too pale for my skin colour and I won't be using it. It would be great for an olive or darker skinned person, but I am too pale and it doesn't enhance my eye contour at all Just another costly experiment in internet purchases."
2,DOUBLE CHARGED FOR THE ITEM ON MY MASTERCARD - NEED A C CREDIT,"HOW DO I CONTACT THE MERCHANT, THEY HIT MY MASTERCARD TWICE FOR THE ITEM. THEY CAN E-MAIL ME A REFUND PER MY ORDER #."
2,Very bright green,this eyeshadow is a very bright kelly green. I personally wanted something closer to the pictured color. I gave the product to a friend who likes to wear more adventurous makeup.
5,Color just right,This color is just right because you can adjust the amount to keep it light or darken it. Works great as eyeliner too!
3,It is lighter than I expected,"It has a nice glow, not glittery at all so perfect for daily wear, but the color is a little lighter than I thought, since I have yellow skin tone it has a rather subtle appearance. Overall it is okay"
2,Not so good,"After reading ""How Elizabeth Barrett Browning Saved My Life"", I decided to read some of her other books. I didn't really care for this one and it seemed to be in a very different writing style than her other books I read."
4,How Brave!,"For the young characters Martin and Hannah we can only think of the word brave!! These two children are from divorced homes and have to live with parents who are continuously deceiving them. Martin's mother devised a plan to have Martin kidnapped by her secret boyfriend (who happens to be Hannah's father) for money that does not exist. Martin's mother believes that his father, whom he does not live with, has won the lottery and she plans to get half of the earnings through ransom. Hannah's father is the co-conspirator with Martin's mother. Although Martin and Hannah did not know each other prior to the kidnapping, the way they met and resolved the kidnapping problem was quite brave and intelligent.This book is suspenseful and surprising with exciting twists and an outcome that was certainly wished for. We highly recommend this book for young adults."
2,Government Knows Better Than You,"Industrialists are evil. Juries are misguided simpletons. These are the beliefs that run through Professor Friedman's History of American Law. But fear not, government will save us all.If you keep in mind his bias, you will find the book a thorough overview of the development of American law."
5,Music to my ears--will capture your heart!,"I own this CD by Eros in both single and double CD releases and I must say, I had no idea this guy existed until a good friend introduced me to ""Eros In Concert"". It is definitely extraordinary. Listen to it once and you'll also want to own it. you won't need to know Italian, to understand what this music makes me feel. Go out and get it then let me know what you think."
5,Una de las Mejores!,"Este volumen lo escuche cuando tenia 19 años. Me gusto bastante la cancion ""Crisis"". Que habla a la juventud de Hoy a no desanimarse sino a seguir adelante. Me gusta Eros Ramazzotti por ese mensaje simple y profundo. Creo que muy poca gente valora su contenido ya que tenemos escapismos. Uno de los grandes escapes que el joven busca en la musica es el ritmo y no prestar a tencion en el Contenido de su mensaje. En Eros Ramazotti no encontraremos musica para bailar pero para meditar."
3,I received the older model not as pictured.,opto stomp is a good compressor if you don't need metering. Amazon sent me the wrong unit twice. They sent me the older unit that has a lasso and rope graphic on the pedal. You will not get what is pictured as they must not have any units left that have the -15db switch which is good for active basses. Buy with caution. Did I mention they sent me the wrong unit even a second time? Seems the pickers just pick forget about reading a refund reason. Oh and the older unit sells for 60 dollars right here on Amazon back in July.... Gonna buy a Markbass Compressore at The local music store.... :(
2,Got sent newer model,I bought this pedal specifically because it was advertised as having the 15dB pad switch which was available on the older model but I received the newer 'monocle and mustache' version. This version has a persistent glitchy ticking sound that accompanies each note you play. Not nice.
3,"Good compresor, not impresive, but nice pedal","If your are looking for a extreme change for your sound, this pedal si not what you need. This opto stomp only gets you a better level for every frecuency that gives your instrument (bass or guitar)in each note and string, its nice compresor, and if you need that is goin to be cool at playing. Only 2 negative things, one is that if you have noise at your amp, it will increase a little bit more, and the other, it changes a little your tone (increasing the mids a few). I used it with a Guild vintage bass, and it quit the characteristic vintage sound, so now I prefer quiting the opto stomp when playin this bass, but with modern basses is fine."
2,A little disappointing,"I wanted a compressor primarily for bass to take the edge off the occasional excessive transient and smoothen up the tone. Well you shouldn't expect magic from a compressor, of course, but I was pretty underwhelmed by this one. The effect is very subtle (or nonexistent), then as you turn it up it suddenly kicks in with a rather unpleasant effect. To my ears it works better on guitar, but again I find the compression extremely abrupt when it kicks in and very audible, not in a good way. I was much more pleased with my TC Electronics rack compressor which I put in the effects loop of my bass amp. That has a much more subtle effect + you get a noise gate as well (and two channels too!) and a lot more versatility for pretty much the same price."
1,Very disappointed,"I was looking forward to receiving this product so I could get some things organized. When they arrived, several of the boxes were cracked. It seems Target sends them out with no packing material around them. I returned the first set and thought I would try again, but the second set arrived the same way, broken, with no packing material to protect them. I quess if they break that easy, they aren't worth buying. It was a very disappointing experience."
4,more than given history,"excellently written with a first person point of view. Gives accout of these 3 young boys lives pre-civil war to the last. Greatly shows honor and pride of Texans, and chivarly of those days. Good history of how this war involved more than the white and negros for which most people really learned about it. Brings forth the great allies of indians both for the north and the south, most forgotten by history books. Would make a great movie or tv mini-series"
5,Nice little practice amp,paired with a Dean Markley Artist Piezo pickup this lil doll by Yamaha amplifies my 15yo's Mountain dulcimer like a dream for home parties to small church settings.~Mary
1,liers,The description and picture submitted for this item leads you to think there are 2 steps for the purchase price. There is only 1 and for 29.00....... so sad that they make yoy think you are getting 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! never again
2,Coover presents familar movies with unpredictable twists,"""A Night at the Movies"" by Robert Coover is a collection of familar cinematic references presented in a montage of short stories. With a continuos theme of violence, Coover masks it with sporatic attempts of dark humor. The collection plays with your imagination by taking familiar characters and presenting them in unpredictable situations constantly surprising the reader. With all of the references to movies, if you aren't an avid film buff most of the symbolism and hidden meanings will not be noticed. Overall I found this book requires constant attention by the reader if you are to fully enjoy Coover's writing."
1,"Grainy, poor quality.","The poster is grainy and of poor print quality, like someone took a small photograph and blew it up to a giant poster size. Not worth the money"
4,Unlike any Textbook you Will Ever Read,"This book is a great resource for any student starting out in the field of science. Not only does it provide great information about writing scientific papers, but it also includes some good stuff about conferences and employment. This book is funny, informative and a great alternative to the usual textbooks offered in this type of class. I would highly recommend it to anyone in any scientific discipline."
3,Reasonably helpful,"Not a bad book, but most of the suggestions are just ""common sense"".The punchline is that clarity is the best characteristic in a scientific publication. It takes a few hundred pages to say it."
1,"Wordy and unexciting, the antithesis of what it should be","Having lost my copy of D. Lindsay's (1995) ""A guide to scientific writing"", which sadly is out of print, I opted for this book as a replacement. I can safely say that this book taught me nothing I didn't know or couldn't learn from journals' Guides to authors, nor did it inspire any new enthusiasm. A book on scientific writing should not be wordy and boring; its strained attempts at baseball humour did little to lift the mood. Visit a used book store and get Lindsay's book instead, a gem collection of wisdom that almost reads itself. All you'll be missing is the Internet age, on which Day & Gastel have precious little to offer."
5,Wonderful!,"I really like this book. It's easy to read, quick, and a great guide. I love Palika's writing style because she says a lot with few words, she gets her point across then moves on to the next one and her books are always informational.The book is about why dogs should know more than sit and down, and how to teach them. It covers obedience and some games and other activities you can do. It's not a step by step ""this is how you make your dog sit"", it's an easy to approach ""I've got a dog, he knows sit, why should I teach him anything else? And if I should, what then?"""
3,Pretty good item,"If I had a couple of complaints it would be that you have to use the company's online formats and pay for that service if you want to save your work.(I would prefer it if they included some kind of disc with the labels or free dowloads for folks who already have earlier versions of the Media Face software, as I do, as the online service is NOT very good!)and my second complaint is that the glue on the envelopes is not very strong!But overall we made some great wedding favor cds with this product just would like to see a couple of improvments."
5,A true mystery novel,"A book that is hard to put down. Remarkably powerful language, precise description of characters and the suspense is almost palpable. A vicious and confusing plot in a wonderful island setting. Once again a mystery novel with a surprising end. This novel is also available in German ""Das Geheimnis des Salzfelsens""- auch hier ein Buch das man ungern weglegt. Ausserordentliche Sprache, präzise Beschreibung der Personen und fast spürbare Spannung. Eine bösartige und verwirrende Handlung eingepackt in eine wunderbare Inselwelt. Wieder einmal ein Krimi mit einem überraschenden Ende."
3,I love the old movie serials!,"I have three Flash Gordons, a Phantom and now, Captain Video! First, the serious criticism. Wooden acting, cheap-looking sets, hand-drawn animation special FX, an impossibly involved, contrived plot, meaningless science-babble jargon. But those are also the charms of this serial. If you want to enjoy some campy fun with good guys versus bad guys, no blood and gore, action a-plenty and happy ending, welcome to Captain Video!!!!!"
3,somewhat disappointing,"Although a legend, Harold Weisberg dropped the ball here. Compared to his earlier work and especially ""Post Mortem"", this book pales in comparison. It does contain some nuggets...but doesn't go anywhere near far enough with regard to criticisms of the FBI and especially the Secret Service.Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
4,Cute - but belt could be more sturdy,"Only giving it 4 stars because the tool belt is not very sturdy or substantial - tools fall out of it and the pockets could be deeper. Also, instead of having two separate tips for the screwdrive why not just have two screwdrivers - flat tip and phillips.The tools are a great size for little hands."
5,Great toy for both my kids,"Our Kitchen is currently under construction, so I really wanted to find a tool belt for both my children because they are obsessed with what is going on. Both my 3 1/2 year old girl and 2 year old son loved it!!! They didn't take the belt off for days. Still, over a month later, my son uses theses tools every day several times a day. Great present, good price, good quality."
1,Not worth the money,"I ordered this for my son to use with his halloween costume but the day before it arrived, I found a better tool belt at Target for the same price. The Target item was Bob the Builder and featured the same tools but also came with a hard hat and a belt that says ""Can we do it? "". So if you don't mind having Bob the Builder items, I would go with that choice because you get more for the money. I would return the item but it's not worth paying the return shipping."
4,Cute but not for age listed,"Let me begin by saying that the product is adorable. We are using it as part of my son's Halloween costume. However, my son is 14 months and we were looking for age appropriate tools. We chose this one because it said the manufacturer's recommended age is 18 months + and that's as close to my son's age as we could find. We turned down the similar products because they were listed as age 2 and up or 3 and up. When we received this box, the age printed on the box is 2 years +. Had I known that, we would have purchased another product. The information needs to be updated on Amazon.com's web site."
4,My grandson loves this,My grandson was very interested in the tools my husband was using to renovate our deck so I bought him his own set. His favorite is the pager which beeps. He holds it up to his ear like a phone.
5,Great addition to a tool bench or other pretend play scenarios,"I purchased this for my little guy's 5th birthday, to go with the tool bench we bought for him. My son has Autism, and doesn't usually like to wear hats or belts, so I'd mainly purchased this for the added tools that came with it. Much to my surprise, my son wanted to wear the tool belt, and has used it with a construction hat to complete his pretend play costume. The belt is well constructed, and it's fabric is thick and double stitched for reinforcement. The tools are simple, but sturdy, and altogether appears as though it will hold up for years to come. this was a great purchase - well worth the price I paid for the item."
1,Bad Quality - Chinese product,"I was totally disappointed with the quality, especially the adjustable spanner and pliers. It was plasticky and fragile not like the ones which you get from Fisher price."
1,Huge amounts of LEAD,"Check out this toy at healthystuff.org (search for Little Builder Tool Belt). The ""utility belt"" in this set has an enormous amount of lead in it, plus some arsenic for good measure."
3,Not realistic,"My 2 year old loves to pretend that he is fixing things, so I thought that this would be ideal. While the toy has absolutely nothing wrong with it, he won't have anything to do with any of it because it doesn't look like the 'real' tools that the grown-ups use. If realism is an issue with your child, I would suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Sister-in-law Approved!,Gifts for a first birthday can be tricky. Something thoughtful as well as memorable was what I wanted. Just like 'da da' was what I thought when I saw this Tool Belt. I hear it was a hit with everyone including my sister-in-law and grandma. He had too many stuffed animals and toys already so this was just right.
5,My Little builder loves it!,"My 20 month old son loves to hammer everything, including things that he just shouldn't, but it's all in good fun. Up til now he has been using legos and pop-onzs to build a hammer. After finding this set I knew it was a winner! It is chunky for little fingers so he can use the tools easily and he loves the pager. (that was a nice touch) He thinks he is big like his daddy with tools like his. Eric is not to sure about the belt itself, maybe he will get the point when he gets bigger. But overall we are very pleased with this toy. Now all we need is a hard hat and a tool box!!"
1,Flimsy and Unimpressive,"Bought this for my 3-year old boy who is interested in ""construction"" tools and was sorely disappointed at its quality, value, and usefulness. This toy is ideal for kids between 1 and 1.5 years who are still working on improving their motor skills and certainly should not be labeled for use by kids 2 years and older. If you are looking for a quality construction-based toy for your kid (older than 1.5 years), look elsewhere!"
3,Simple tool belt,"I can't say anything negative, but I would like to add a few improvements. My son is 20 months, he tries to tie on himself(valcro would be helpful), the tools don't stay in the pockets very well. He's to busy taking them out all the time that he doesn't mind it...The pager is fun!!If I would to look for a product simular to this one, I would take a deeper look into getting something that would allow them to play pretend without mom's assistance.Overall all its okay, not dissatified, but not highly satified."
4,Toddler Tools,"These tools were a big hit with the 2 year old birthday boy. The belt is convenient but hardly used. However, the tools are light, fairly harmless and easy to handle. He plays with them a lot and mimics his Dad, who uses tools to fix his big boy toys."
5,really helps my hot flashes,really helps my hot flashes. nothing else has worked and I don't need to take it all of the time.
5,Excellent,"This product has helped me deal with all of the annoying symptoms of perimenopause. Night sweats, rare, flashes, non-existent. I hope this helps you as much as it's helped me."
2,"Ugghhhhhhh; John Travolta didn't do it, again....","By watching the previews, ""Domestic Disturbance"" looked like it was going to be a somewhat intelligent thriller, but instead I got a cheesy, farfetched movie. The acting was horrible; the actors put no emotions into what they were saying. Whoever wrote the script must be shot and never allowed to work again. The whole movie was implausible. It felt like I was in an 80's movie, because my intelligence was insulted so badly. Basically, most of the things in the movie couldn't have happened. A mother would not have been so stupid as the one in this movie. But it did entertain me, partly because of Steve Buscemi's short but funny scenes he had. If you want to see this movie, wait to video. Otherwise, maybe I'd wait for ""Spy Game"" to see a good thriller and go for a family film."
2,Very Familiar thriller i have seen before,"Domestic Disturbance is about as much fun as taking a dip in apool full of acid. Predictable storyline one dimensional stylecharacters nothing too refreshing to see. Travolta stars as adivorced father who works as a boatbuilder gets suspisous of hisex's soon to be husband when his son tells him how abusive he is.Of course the woman in these type of films are generaly so stupidshe can't see the new man in her life is a psychopath. Travolta'skid witnessess his stepfather killing an old cellmate from his shady past in his jeep and then burns his body in a i ron scrap yard. So by the end of the film the father/hero gets the inevitable showdown with stepfather/psycho in one of the most silliest, cliched fight scenes i have seen in a long time. John Travolta is capabale of so much better than what this lame scriptoffers him."
1,Less if I could,"This movie offended my intelligence. The Keystone cops, the absence of logic, & unconvincing parents by the lead roles. You must have a better way to spend 90 minutes."
2,OK rainy day viewing,"I don't know how some movies get favourable quotes from some reviewers on their posters. Do studios pay people to say nice things about their pictures? If so this was probably one of those movies. This is an old story too. A kid suspects that his new step father (Vince Vaughan) is a psycho; and when he witnesses him committing a murder and cremating the body he runs to his real father (Travolta) who doesn't believe him either, but soon has his doubts because being a movie, his son is perfect and never lies to him. (Feeble feeble feeble). John Travolta gives a good performance and is one of the main reasons for watching this. Vince Vaughan on the other hand does pretty well too, but whenever I see him I am reminded of how awful he was in that pointless PSYCHO remake several years back. You've seen it all before, but DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE still stands way above BATTLEFIELD EARTH."
3,Don't Even Bother.,"This is what I call a ""Neutral Movie"". It isn't bad or good at the same time. It's supposed to be a thriller, but it has no twists or turns. This is the reason why I almost skipped the end. Looking at the rest of the movie, I could easily guessed what the ending would look like and it would to be. Also, the acting doesn't make up for it, all it does is equal it. This makes it seem longer than it is.If I could have given some advice to the makers of this film, I would have suggested to atleast put an alternate ending on the DVD.So, overall, ""DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE"" is not worth the your money because a ""Neutral Movie"" doesn't anything, and you won't want to watch this movie again, because there's nothing to be confused about in this film."
3,TV Movie,"It would have been better to release it as a movie of the week on UPN. Travolta is great, the story been done time and time again. Divorced Dad wanting to spend time with his kid, his ex-wife is getting remarried and the son needs to adjust to all the changes in his life. As a theatrical release it is weak, the suspense could have been turned up considerably. For TV or straight to DVD, is worth watching."
3,"Great movie, but awful DVD quality!!!!!!",This is a great movie of a child in jeopardy. John Travolta is a wonderful actor as always. Vincent Vaughn is a great bad guy. the movie works. The DVD quality on the other hand is 100% awful. The picture looks stretched throughout making the heads of the people in the movie look elongated. Paramount should really reconsider this dvd and reformat it to make it more appealing to the eye.
1,"Oh Dear, Travolta Shines as Mr Nice Guy","but what a diabolically bad movie,utterly predictable plot, miserably cliched characters and a third rate script, not even interesting locations. In total, ...avoid in the cinema..."
2,Felt like a made for TV movie with some swearing! Cliched!,"This movie fells like a made for TV movie. The story has been done before so many times. The stars do what they can with the material but this movie is so predictable. If you've seen the movie ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" think of this movie as a male vs. male version! And instead of a baby, change to a teenager! I like Vince Vaughn and John Travolta but I found it hard to belive in thier roles. I only hope when this movie comes out on DVD, we get to see the R rated version of this movie! I wonder if it's better than the PG-13 version?Also the charcters are cliched and sterotyped!If you do see this wait until it hits your local cheap theaters or a matinee! Do'nt pay full price for this rehashed movie! Or better yet, watch ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" which this movie is a direct rip-off of!"
2,Why do people do these movies,"You'd think that anyone involved in this movie would be ashamed to admit it. The plot could have been written by a computer full of hack phrases. The predictable turned into straight jacket fidelity to old and tired plots of B movies. Other than that it was.... pretty bad. The acting was OK, but there was an air of desperation in the faces of the actors. Why? Well -- I can only guess here -- because maybe the director wasn't always paying attention? No, that can't be the case because this was not evidence of randomness -- it was uniformly badly directed. That takes constant attention from a very worthless director working with a screenwriter who has the sophistication of a 12 year old."
4,"""Domestic Disturbance"" is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action","""Domestic Disturbance"" is a thriller about a divorced couple and their child. Frank (John Travolta) has to deal with a man marrying his ex-wife Susan. The guy (Vince Vaughn) is well liked by the community, but there are hints of something being amiss with him. Frank's son claims he witnesses his mother's new husband Rick commit murder. The more Frank investigates Rick, the more suspicious he looks. The investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse.There is great interaction between Travolta as a concerned parent and Vaughn the cold heartless type. The tension between them breeds suspense. The would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those around him. There are few things he wouldn't do to get his way.""Domestic Disturbance"" is entertaining with its high-tension suspense and great action. I highly recommend it for those who enjoy a thriller that will keep you guessing to the last minutes."
2,Uninspired thriller,"This really isn't a ""bad"" movie - just incredibly formulaic and predictable. The people who made this flick had the good sense to cap it under 90 minutes. John Travolta always pleases as the ""good guy,"" and Vince Vaughn is genuinely creepy. I guess. But Hollywood continues to churn out these weak thriller films."
3,Make sure you know who you are dealing with....,"This is a good flick. Travolta finally plays the good guy. He even does a halfway decent job. He is much better as the villain though.I didn't like the story too much. Being a family man, domestic violence does not sit well with me. Anyway, it's not bad. There are times that it becomes predicatable, but that is still ok. As expected, you root for the good guy. As with most suspense films, you are constantly telling the characters ""to look over their shoulders, the bad guy is right behind you....""Not a keeper, but worth viewing."
4,EXCELLENT!,TRAVOLTA IS GREAT HE REALLY SHOWS HOW TO ACT IN TIMES OF SUSPENCE WHEN HIS KID TELLS HIM HE SAW HIS STEP FATHOR KILL I MAN AND THEN IT GETS REALLY GOOD. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE MOVIE IS TO SHORT 88 MINS FOR THIS TYPE OF MOVIE IS TO SHORT. BUT NIT PICKING ASIDE IF YOU WANT A FEW CHILLS AND JUMPS DONT RENT THIS BUY THIS ITS WORTH IT
2,Predictable,"What started out interestingly enough quickly turned into a ""boy-witnesses-murder-but-no-one-believes-him flick. The rest of the movie was predictable, the ending boring and flat. Nothing new. Nothing even remotely exciting. Travolta was not at his best, but he couldn't be, not in this stinker of a movie. Even Vince Vaughn with all his creepiness couldn't pull this one out of the dump. He has two personalities - one innocent and pure, the other evil and sadistic. Neither one was believable."
5,Domestic Disturbance,"This was a great movie, gives you insight into a childs lifeafter Divorce, and his love for his Dad."
2,Disturbed!,"Although Vince Vaughn is surprisingly believeable as a bad guy, Domestic Disturbance is still a bit predictable. I'm not saying that it's not watchable, I'm just saying you can probably guess the direction of the scenes; thus, my conservative rating."
4,travoltas image is awesome,travolta is astounding in this movie as the father of a boy who witnesses his step dad played evily by vince vaughn. the end is a little off but the rest is great and who better to be murdered then steve buscemi huh. well anyway its a nice film and the suspense is great
2,Not nearly scary enough.,"Travolta is believable as the concerned, protective father but somehow the movie just falls short of being scary. Vince Vaughan is one of my favorite actors but he's better as the obnoxious side kick in Made than as the sinister step father. It just didn't grab me and keep me on the edge of my seat."
2,very predictable,"It's a sheer waste of Travolta's talent even though he gave a good performance, the plot is very predictable, repeated and lame. I would rent this movie just for John Travolta's and Vince Vaughn's performances, Steve Buscemi does justice to a creepy character, but movie is no thriller."
1,Boring.,"Trailer for this movie was inaccurate. It made the movie more exciting, action-packed and suspenseful-looking than it really was. The movie was slow and what few exciting scenes there were did not really draw me in, particularly the finale at the garage. I can tell that this movie was trying to be like a Hitchcock movie, but it fell flat on it's face."
5,A fantastic Movie,I purchased the DVD before even seeing the movie only because I am a huge John Travolta Fan and own almost all of his movies. Even if John Travolta wasn't in this movie it is very well written. I would encourage anyone who loves a good suspense movie to purchase this DVD. I know you will enjoy it as much as I do.
2,Poorly Finished,"This mirror is cheaply made. My great complaint is that the metal hoop that forms the rim of the mirror has sharp edges, where one could easily get scratched. Furthermore, on the side of the concave (magnifying) mirror, there is a gap between the edge of the rim and the glass.I needed a mirror that extended about 20 inches from the wall. The only such mirror I could find that was of better quality, was the IRVING RICE for $260. The latter price seemed too high to me. Therefore, I covered the sharp edges of the rim with hot-melt glue, and kept the mirror. I was left with a mirror that is serviceable, but looks jury-rigged."
5,Excellent,"L'article a été reu rapidement, et en bon état. Le livre est très intéressant, et les explications sont de qualité."
3,Popular survey of math and math biography,"This is less a history of mathematics than an attempt to give a popular survey of the entire field, with much accompanying biographical material on relevant mathematicians. Ordering of the material is roughly according to the chronological order of the origins of each subfield.The author states at the beginning that her target audience is the layman without advanced mathematical training. I felt the level of the exposition was about right for that audience, maybe a little high at times. The biographical material was engagingly written, but it sometimes sounded like she was talking to children, and I have reservations about the accuracy of some of it. It often reminded me of Bell's _Men of Mathematics_."
5,"Fast-moving, mini-mystery romance--loved it!","Holly has always longed for the happiness she found in the books she's read to children at the library where she works. Though she found comfort with her fiance, she lost hope when he was taken in a tragic accident. Then she found...Craig.Craig enjoyed Holly's company and assistance, yet struggled with amnesia and drove himself to find some piece of his past. In as much as Holly wanted to help him, she also feared the mystery of his past---ending their future!"
4,Great Live Show.,"Saw the band at L'Amour's in Brooklyn, NYC. Great live band, if you like heavy rock. The band blends it's instruments very well, all are a great combination. CD is worth it!"
3,misinformation,"I bought this product because it was advertised as being harvested in Korea.It's from China. My husband likesMw Polar Smoked Clams Pouch, 3-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)the clams, but I won't buy them again. Packing is great and the shipment arrived promptly.J. Jones"
2,Not sure about this one,My doctor recommended that I give this product a try to boost my immune system and help me with lagging energy levels. I've been using it for a few months now and I have not noticed any difference in my energy levels at all. I would pass on this in the future as I really couldn't justify spending the money on it.
1,This item contains Almost No Resveratrol compared with other products,"Most studies are recommending between about 500 and 1200 mg TRANS resveratrol per day. This item contains about 16mg per it's label with other ""stuff"". So if your looking for TRANS resveratrol this item is pretty much one of the worst choices you could make for your money. This stuff is expensive and that may be why they put so little in each tablet."
4,Not Really A Resveratrol Supplement!,"When I was offered a bottle of this supplement I was excited. I heard that Resveratrol was helpful for weight loss. However, this supplement doesn't have the minimum amount of Resveratrol to help with weight loss (according to Dr. Oz) so don't think of it as a weight loss supplement. Think of it as an antioxidant supplement. I've been taking it for a month and while everyone around me is sick with the flu I am as healthy as can be. I'm not saying for sure that the supplement helped but this is my experience. Please be aware that the pills are quite large so if you have problems swallowing pills then this might be an issue for you."
3,Perry & Cece,"This is a cute read. It's not overly dramatic or brain draining. It's just fun. If you hail from the 60's, you'll love the references to clothing styles and Perry's type of detecting. The primary focus is a mystery that possibly surrounds work done by Earle Stanley Gardner in his legal, pre-writer days. While fictional, the author does a nice job of spanning the decades while providing some mystery and fun."
1,Worst sound system ever!,"Not only is this the worst iPod system I have heard, this is by far the worst ""sound system"" (it's more like a noise maker) I have ever owned. You're better off buying a ten dollar set of tiny unamplified speakers than getting this thing.Like many others I have heavy distortion and a high pitched buzzing/humming. I have had these sounds since day one, but after the first week my system stopped turning off. Now it is constantly in either iPod mode or radio mode. The only way to avoid the distortion is to have the iPod EQ off, turn off the bass boost on the system, and put the volume at 50%; but then the high pitched sound is just as loud as the music.My girlfriend has a smaller iPod docking alarm clock from some small company I've never heard of: she paid the same as I did for mine, and hers sounds like Bose compared to this. Look around, I would have rather paid the ten dollars more to get something that doesn't sound like a baby monitor."
1,Seconded and thirded.,"I purchased two of these for my wife and myself and both of the units had the exact same problem as mentioned by the below reviewer. A very annoying and noticeable hissing/buzzing sound came through both the speakers and headphones when listening at quiet volumes. The only way to stop the hissing is to pull the player off the charger and use the aux cord or turn on the backlight of the ipod. Additionally, the clock on my player doesn't work. These are going back to the store; don't waste your time or money."
1,Garbage,"If I could have given this item zero stars, I would have. This is the worst piece of crap I have ever owned. I bought this at my local Walmart and was super excited to finally get one for my 30gb video iPod. What a piece of junk! First of all, there is a constant buzzing/squeaking sound going on the whole time whenever music is playing. As if that wasn't bad enough, after about a week, it wouldn't turn off anymore! The thing was constantly on all the time and the only way to shut it off is to unplug it.I read all the instructions that came with this lemon and I tried all their troubleshooting tips...none of them worked. I wish I had read the reviews here on Amazon before purchasing. I learned a great lesson about impulse buying!I have since purchased and iHome iPod dock/clock radio for $50 at Walmart ($44 here on Amazon!) and it is fantastic. Not as good as my Bose, mind you, but it's really great. Go with iHome instead and avoid this Emerson garbage like the plague!"
1,"Power's not a choice, it's an inevitability.","I'm having the same problem as Kathleen. My girlfriend has the same problem, and I currently have her iHome on my floor, unscrewed and attempting to figure this one out. Unfortunately, the chip board in it is right near the top of the unit, and taking it out without breaking anything looks to be too much of a hassle for me. As far as my sight can tell though, it appears as though the switch is making its connections like it's supposed to... And I wasn't able to find a website for repair techniques.However, for you out there browsing for an iHome, and considering this one: DON'T. Instead, look into the RA-P31 by JVC. It's the kind that I own, and it works beautifully. I haven't had a problem with it in 4 months of ownership so far. I think they sell for an average of $70, but trust me. it's worth the money to get something that functions as it should."
2,Like a bad boyfriend!,This system worked fine for what I needed to begin with when I bought it last year. Charging and a little music while we were camping. My grandson was charging his iPod and listening to the music last night and the dang thing started smoking through the vents in the back with a stinky electrical burn smell!!! Very scary to both of us! We immediately unplugged the system and removed the iPod. Just like the guy/gal who's great to begin with until you get to know him a little better. Going back to the store and will report for a recall!! Could have been very dangerous if we hadn't been right at the system!! BEWARE - DANGEROUS!!
2,Can't get it to turn off,The power button on it doesn't work anymore. So I have to unplug it every time I am done listening to it. It doesn't bother me too much other than I can't use it for an alarm clock like I was hoping to do so.
1,can't turn it off!,"I bought this for my room because I wanted a clock radio that would also play my ipod. After just 3 days, the power button stopped working and it stayed on. I took it back to the store, exchanged it for another one and the second one did the same thing!! This time it took about 3 weeks to screw up. Now I can't turn the power off and am forced to awake to the horrible buzzer sound every morning. Sound quality not great but adequate. Never did have the hissing sound."
2,Horrible Sound - You get what you pay for!!,"Initially, this looked like a great buy - the price was good and the product looked nice. However, there is a constant static/buzzing noise that comes from the speakers. I read that if you left the IPOD backlight turned on it would help with the static, but it doesn't make any difference on mine. I find that if I turn the volume up loud, the buzzing lessens, but I bought this for my office and cannot play loud music. My recommendation - return this product and pay more for something that works!!"
4,Not so bad - good deal for the price,"I don't find any of the problems mentioned by other reviewers. I tried 4 different brands, including the Emerson bedside alarmclock version and found this model better for my kitchen.The sound is not great, but adaquate and reasonable for $50.My only problem is that it will not pick up any AM radio stations and offers no outside antenea jack."
1,Worst thing ever invented,"You know, sometimes we have things around the house that have been ""Mickey moused"" or just learned to live with. I did not realize until today how much of a piece of junk this is. When we first got it, the volume knob stopped working within a few weeks, it makes crusty sounds. The radio does not stay tuned in, the on-off button stopped working within 2 months so if we wanted to turn it on and off we would have to unplug the bulky cable. The iPod dock makes a loud hum sound with no audio, the only way we can use the iPod is by using the auxiliary plug in the back (cable not included) If it were anymore possible to get something to be crappier than this, I would like to see it - I would be amazed. Absolute garbage, not even worth it if it were free."
4,Decent Value,"Unlike the others who reviewed this item, I have had no problems with the unit whatsoever. I use it in my office where I work, so I need not have loud levels, but there is no high pitch noises emitting from the unit at all. It plays the music well enough, the only gripe I have with it is I wish it came with a remote. Good all round product though."
1,It broke completely after 10 months,"This was a gift; I actually wasn't unhappy with the sound, but it BROKE within about 10 months -- irreparably. And it only comes with a three-month warranty. Piece of crap! (And it was not hard use -- I simply had it on a shelf for those 10 months and mostly only used it to listen to the radio!)"
2,Too expensive and not enough noisy,The shippging was too expensive it was more then the price of the whistle. Another thing that bug me is that you have to blow very hard to have a loud sound. Not like the other fox 40.
3,Whistle,This is not the easiest whistle to be heard. You really have to blow hard to get it to be heard. Really disappointed.
5,Breaking down complex analyses,"This is an excellent book. Multilevel modeling and survival analysis are becoming increasingly important in psychological studies, but are pretty complicated procedures. Singer & Willet offer both a conceptual background and practical ways to do the analyses in a clear, understandable manner. The book is very readable and will be an important reference for future analyses!"
5,bug guard,The product works great and looks good on my 2002 Windstar.Great price! Took a while to find one. Glad it fit.Thank you for reading my review.
1,disappointed,"First the book is poorly written. Second if you eliminate all the times the writer repeates himself the book becomes 40 pages instead of 200. Of these 40 pages he borrows ideas and opinions from other writers. There is nothing original in this book, sorry I bought it."
1,I never got it - waste of money,"My order never came to my house. I'm going to return it even when I receive it just to not support their lack of shipping responsibility. They said they'd give me a refund but I still need to return the book, can't do that if I don't have it! I didn't get a UPS tracking or anything in my email either. Plus I've been needing it for my World Literature class. Since I never got it, I was able to find most of the reading online. And just bullsh***ed the assignments for what I couldn't find the reading on. I'm never buying from these guys again."
5,How the Beatles Wrote Their Hit Songs,"""Composing the Beatles Songbook - Lennon & McCartney 1966 - 1970"" is a documentary exploring the partnership, music, and impact of John Lennon and Paul McCartney as composers during their immensely creative period. The DVD incorporates rare footage, classic performances, and interviews with friends of the pair as well as with Beatles historians. We learn the hows, whens, and whys of such Beatles songs as ""Eleanor Rigby,"" ""Hey Jude,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""Revolution,"" ""Get Back,"" and ""I Am the Walrus."" Seldom has the genesis of pop songs been put to such careful scrutiny. For those who remember those years firsthand, this DVD will provide both nostalgia and the back stories of the songs of youth. For those too young to recall those years, the DVD will shed light on the combination of talent, artistry, experimentation, and marketing that made the Beatles such an unparalleled phenomenon."
5,Excellent documentary!,"There are many mediocre to really bad Beatles retrospectives and documentaries out there and unfortunately, I own many of them. Composing The Beatles Songbook, however, is not one of them. The panel is first rate: people who were close friends of the Beatles during the sixties and people who are ""experts"" on the Beatles and their music. I particularly like the diversity of opinions on the panel. Some seem more partial to Paul's style and some seem more partial to John's style so it's not biased towards either of them. If you're a serious fan of the Beatles' music, you have to check out this series!"
4,INTERVIEWS BY RELATED BEATLES KNOWLEDGE,Interresting story and informations by friends and related about the fab but it is pity there no subtitles in other language than English ! For serious and complete collector.
5,Bloody Good,"I absolutly hate the new punk pop scene right now. I want to smash the tv anytime i see good charlotte or simple plan. But these guys are different. They are absoluty incredible. This is coming from a guy whose fav band is Metallica. If you like any kind of music that has guitars in it, buy this album. I was very impressed to hear the solos in this album. Very cool. Buy the first album with this one. Both are very good."
3,Not the best one,"The Living End first album blew my mind away, so i was expecting to get blown by this one. But the album wasn't a clomplete let down theres a few good songs in here."
2,this is not any good for many reasons.,But mainly for this band to attempt the 'street' sound is very bad for them as it not something they can perform well. This is an average album which is OK but I am much disappointed as it is not in par with the other material of this band which I have then enjoyed a lot.
3,Not the greatest,"Roll On, despite starting off strong with three good tracks, ends up to be just average. It's message is missed in the US, (seeing as how all their songs relate to their homeland, Australia). And like most CDs, all the tracks begin to sound the same after a while. While the song Roll On got easily 100 plays, the rest of the CD might have gotten 10."
4,Great Aussie PUnk rawk....,....these guys rule man....prisoner of society rules even more....nice review huh?
4,Good stuff,"This cd is an very good choice for anybody who loves the punk genre. After seeing them open up for green day i automatically fell in love with there australian punk style. Tracks like ""Roll on"" and ""Dirty Man"" really show you their great melodies. After listening to this cd you will also notice how much they were influenced by the clash."
4,Super Nice Guys!!,"I met the Living End one day at Guitar Center, and I have to say these guys are really nice!! This CD is OK, I like 'Hellbound' better. With their radio-crazed song, ""Roll On"" is a good song, but they sound better live to be truthful. This Melbourne, AL band is really rad! I would recomend this CD to any punk lover. Their songs arent about relationships like *N Sync but silly and funny things! Buy this CD if it pleases you!"
5,WONDERFUL ALBUM!!!,Living End is a very great band. Their first cd was very great but I think that Roll On is better. The songs are better and there's more maturity in their sound. One of the greatest disc since the beginning of the year...
1,DO NOT BUY!! DO NOT BUY!! DO NOT BUY!!,"You will NOT get what you order!!Same as the last reviewer, I ordered this CLEAR HIGH-BACK STAND shown in the photo from Wowzzer, and instead got a SMALL BLACK STAND with a long solid front face, the BCW-Pro-Mold-Sports-Stand-Display. It is completely worthless to me, as it doesn't suit the purpose for which I bought it, unlike the one pictured."
3,Fans will be satisfied.,"I admit to coming rather late to the Micheal Crawford fandom but I've come to greatly admire his work. While his vocal skills are very good, even he admits that it was his Phantom success that allowed him succeed as a recording artist. It's doubtful he would get very far on American Idol-type programs. His style is too soft and elegant.Having said that, his CD is worth buying. His selections seem to focus on lost love, which may at the time have echoed his own personal story about which he writes in his very good autobiography.Well done."
5,Full of Surprises,Fun toy for our 14 mo. grandson. I continually put different things inside and he loves pulling them out always finding a different surprise. The little items that come with the toy are really nice and sized perfectly for little hands.
3,Love it but... can't wash it!!,"Great toy - my 7 month old son loves it. Or I should say lovED it... because he got sick, so I washed it... and it fell apart. I just never thought that a toy for a young child would not be able to be washed - especially a soft toy. I intentionally avoid plastic toys, and like soft ones because I always assume I can throw them in the washer. Not the case here. The material that keeps the elephant stiff to create the box shape came out, and it's crumpled flat now... and the material is crumbled all over the smaller pieces!Just be warned, you can't clean this item!!"
3,It's okay,"cute elephant and attachments. However, my twin 11 month old grandchildren were not very interested in it. I really don't think it was worth purchasing."
4,Fun new version of Time After Time,"This is a fun new 2-step/pop version of Cyndi Lauper's 80's hit. The cd contains 4 mixes, a radio edit, original mix, Urban Legendz Remix, and a GD Dub mix."
1,Needs some work,"Her voice needs some serious work, Univision music just wants her to be their next cash cow Pop star. ""Porque tu no estas"" The only good thing it has it's the chorus, and the rest of her songs are really just a waste of Money and time."
3,"Good unit, poor documentation","This unit came with a four-page, glossy documentation sheet. It described in great detail how to mount the feet under the unit, and how to take them off, but was quiet about when and how to turn the unit on and off. It also said nothing about its internal software. This is how not to sell an otherwise good piece of hardware to the general public."
5,External Hard drive,Very reliable and exceptionally quiet.Have it hooked up to my G5. Reformatted it for the Mac and works without a hitch.
1,The Shadow Creeps,"I can't even give this 2 stars as another reviewer did. This is another slap together dvd by Whirlwind Media who are only concerned with making money. The transfer is from a 16mm print off, most likely, a Sinister Cinema VHS tape. The only reason I even bought this is because it's one of those incredibly rare serials. The sound is pretty much muddied throughout the dvd and the print itself isn't much better. I had high hopes at first as the opening title sequence, although not crisp and clean, was viewable. After that, it becomes a hit and miss affair even more than their release of The Phantom Creeps. I wish Whirlwind would put some effort into cleaning up the video and sound--it isn't that difficult to do as one can see from the efforts of the Doctor Who Restoration Team. Again, as I stated in my Phantom Creeps review, STAY AWAY FROM WHIRLWIND MEDIA!!!"
3,I goofed!,"This Timeless Video release is NOT the original serial but a condensed version. Like the original ran for three or four hours and this version has been condensed to 73 minutes.There is lots of action crammed into that time span, and Lugosi is suitably creepy. There are good scenes. But it's not likely to satisfy true serial collectors."
5,Amazing Book,"Love this book, use it all the time to work on new poses. Would be a great gift for any yogi."
1,extremely disappointed,"I have been been teaching yoga for 30 years, and am always researching ways to bring some freshness to my classes. When I saw the title and read the reviews I was very excited to get the book. However, when I received the book, and saw the photos of the demonstrator I was dismayed. These photos were just reprints from some of my very oldest books. This was first printed in 1939!!! It states that many of the photos are from 1984. I am sorry, I know Dharma is supposed to be some kind of a super guru, but his sullen expression in a overly revealing speedo was borderline obscene and the harsh black and white photos were just cold and uninspiring to say the least. 80% of the poses are so extreme that the average student could never achieve them, the book was misrepresented and a total waste of money. I will stick to my Yoga Journal magazine. I DON""T recommend this book!!"
2,Totally dispensable,"I practice yoga a long time. I bought this book thinking that this cold help me in my practice. But it is just an ""art"" book. Just a lot of asanas photos. No tips, no advertisements, no variations, no sequences. Nothing!! Just a man whit a thong.Maybe, purchase the poster. And of course, the best book Light on Yoga of Iyengar."
1,very disappointed,"Please note that this book is very small!! I wish that I had noticed the dimensions.I purchased this book believing that it would help me learn more asanas... I could not have been more wrong. It is an ""art"" book of asanas... and does not show you the position, just the man in the pose. They are artistic and gorgeous photos... but not a good instructional book. I wish that I had not purchased this book and am extremely disappointed ..."
2,Looks different than it appears on Amazon,"Ok, so it depends on what you are wanting from this book. It is basically this:A small book with glossy images of poses (black background with white image) and the name of the pose.There is nothing else written beyond an introduction.As a yoga teacher, I flip thru this occasionally for inspiration (although most ofthis is too advanced for my students.)It's kind of a novelty; not sure I'd purchase it again."
2,Love the message not the messenger,I would love to have a copy of this in a different form. It is very thick and the binding is not up to the challenge. A larger hardback with 4 shots to a page would be a better treatment for these inspiring plates.
2,Look elsewhere,"I contemplated purchasing this online, but decided to take a look at it in a bookstore. I'm glad I did. If you're interested in learning yoga poses, look elsewhere. Even if you're after a book that captures the beauty and art of yoga, look elsewhere. The photos looked grainy and the book is so short and fat that it won't lie flat. Keep shopping."
4,in bad conditions,"The book is in worse conditions than it was advertised. Thank goodness it was the right price, becouse otherwise i'd send it back. its really worn out."
5,Emulate a yogi master,"I have watched Dharma Mittra`s incredible poses live and through his poster, and I have wished to scrutinize each under magnification and learn from each pose to the fullest. My wish came true. This book is an incredible reference and inspiration, covering the full scope of hatha yoga (many poses come as a surprise even to the experienced). There are beautiful introductions to the chapters written by Dharma. Otherwise, the focus is simply and brilliantly on the asana (1 per page- one can also interestingly use this as an animated ""flip book"" to better understand Dharma's movement in the sequences). There are no distractions of accessory text or excessive design on these pages. Although the book has a contemporary look, I feel at times I am viewing an ancient book on yoga...and I realize in many ways I am. We are told the best path to perfecting our hatha yoga practice is to watch a yogi master practice to perfection and then emulate them. Here is our opportunity."
4,Beautiful,"Asanas collects 608 of black-and-white photographs, each accompanied by the English name of the pose and the Sanskrit characters, brief commentary, and specific combinations for Vinyasa, Ashtanga, and Iyengar practice. There are suggestions for beginning, intermediate, and advanced yoga practitioners, as well as a list of poses beneficial for particular health problems and chakra relationships. Because it builds on basic postures, Asanas will appeal to students of any of the 100 yoga styles. This would make a wonderful gift for anyone who is interested in yoga."
2,Was good when it worked,When the monitor was finally adjusted so that it made a connection then it would work but after a few months it quit working altogether. You get what you pay for.
4,decent product poor shipping,Just received my flush mount for my Garmin 541s. The mount is fine and will meet my needs for flush mounting my chartplotter/sounder. My issue is with the vendor who did a horrible job of packing the mount. It was jammed into a priority mail package without any regard for the contents. Fortunately it arrived intact.
3,Urban geography,Definitely not a leisure read. This is quite possibly the hardest book I have ever read. The authors are to wordy and drag out sentences making it hard to follow their train of thought. So if its not a required book for a class find a different book.
3,Fun for toddlers,I watched by grandbaby watch this and it held her attention for half of it. That's why the 3 stars - worth buying.
4,A true M*A*S*H fan's dream come true.,"This is an incredible book, featuring full color photos of the television show M*A*S*H. It includes a complete episode guide, behind the scenes stories and photos, interviews with the stars of the show, and much more. This is a must have for serious M*A*S*H fans."
2,As Hawkeye would say.......,"""We want something else!!!We want something else!!!'The pictures are great. But.....It saddens me to see someone want to make money off of an American institution like M*A*S*H, and not have any clue as to what she is talking about. ...The episode guide is awful, just plain awful.Entire storylines omitted, some storylines changed around, some storylines that never happened. What bothers me most is that in the beginning of the book, the author says there may be a few mistakes, and makes a flippant ""take two asprin"" comment. Well, in my opinion, if you are going to write a ""Complete"" book about something, there shouldn't be this many mistakes. ... The 2 stars are for the pictures"
2,The incomplete book of MASH.,This book has some great info but the episode synopses are absolutely terrible. Characters are misquoted and important points are missed. The interviews with the writers and actors are very nice but the author and the publisher should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for such sloppy work.
2,Save your money,"My wife bought me this book, knowing what a MASH-aholic I am, and I must say I am terribly dissapointed. The pictures are terrific, but the episode guide sounds like it was written by someone who didn't even watch the show. Many of the episode write-ups are incorrect, either entire storylines omitted, changed around or in certain instances, the author just made things up that never happened. ...Jim Schmiedeberg"
5,good but not great,"As some have already said this is a great ""companion"" to the episodes of MASH. However she doesn't give the full plot of the episodes and there is no interview from Mclean Stevenson which is even sadder now that he has passed away. This is a great guide to finding out the titles and lots but not all of the information about all 251 episodes, including goodbye fareweel and amen. There are lots of great photos from the shows as well which are very nice. This book isn't perfect but it's pretty close so iif you love the show and want to be able to have cast interviews and lots of info about the show then check this book out."
2,Concur With Mr. Geisler,This was a lame book that gives very little behind the scenes of the show. She may have worked hard to view every episode and review most or all the scripts but Ms. Kalter gave very little insight that a MASH buff (and I am not one of those) would not have known already.
5,THE COMPLETE BOOK OF M*A*S*H IS A GREAT BOOK!,THE COMPLETE BOOK OF M*A*S*H IS A GREAT BOOK EVERY MASH FAN SHOULD HAVE THIS BOOK!I LOVE THE PICTURES IN IT THEY ARE GREAT!FROM A BIG MASH FAN FOR 6 YEARS NOW KIRSTEN
3,Not exactly the most accurate book,"I have watched M*A*S*H for years and own the DVD collection. This book contains exerpts from every single episode. The only people I can see having an interest is a very, very big fan, such as myself. Unfortunately, the exerpts are only about 50% accurate at best. I think that either the author a) never watched the shows b) watched the beginning and the end only or c) possibly got the exerpts from reading the scripts that may have been changed when the episode was filmed. Whatever the case, the book is extremely disappointing. There are some biased letters from the cast and some really good pictures (some with the wrong episode/caption). I got this as a gift, thank goodness, because it is not worth much even to a big fan such as myself."
3,"Not ""complete"", but worthwhile.","Kalter's ""complete"" book of MASH is, sadly, not complete: many of the episode synopses are unsatisfactory in that they are incomplete, focus on a minor rather than the major story line or simply oversimplify stories to such an extent that they come across completely wrong.The good thing, on the other hand, is that the synopses suffice to remind you of some particular episode, that there are complete lists of writers and directory for each episode, interviews with the main actors (Rogers, Alda, Farr, Linville, Farrell, Burghoff, Christopher, Morgan, Stiers and Swit) as well as writers/producers Gelbart, Reynolds and Metcalfe, and many pictures from the series, most in black and white, but also many in colour.I would have wished for more behind-the-scenes information and more accurate story synopses, but as it stands, this book is a worthwhile addition to the bookshelf that no MASH aficionado should be without."
5,A must have for all you fans who can't remember that name,"This book is excellent!! A must have for any and all M*A*S*H fans!! It has tons of pictures, and lots of information. The only problems are 1) It could be a little more complete and 2) there are numerous errors. What I mean about errors are not gramitical, but in the show's plot. She does say that she got the information from the scripts, so there's bound to be some changes from the writing to the airing. But other then that, this book is great!"
2,1001 Boring Nights (That's how long it takes to read this book),I read a lot of books and I must say that this one was hard to read. It's very repetitive and talks about the same things over and over again.I was extremely dissapointed. Expected more from the Bio of one of the richest men in the world.
4,Not Bad!,"Fatboy Slim delivers overall solid beats and rhythms on this impressive mix CD. The style ranges from house to trance to electronica, and the whole thing works well. The disc sets the tone for the inefectious housed-up ""Austins Groove"" by Kid Creme, the trippy yet infectious ""Where's Your Head At"" by the ever-funky Basement Jaxx, and Fatboy Slim's own ""Star 69."" The disc does have a few minutes of filler, but I was overall impressed. Whether you're looking for music for a party or a good disc to workout with, ""Live on Brighton Beach"" is a smart move."
2,guys like this should stay in the studio,"people like mr. cook are at their best when they have a studio at their disposal and their worst when they have to perform live with no over-dubbing or gimmicks. i was fortunate enough to be given this disc by industry insiders and if i'd spent my own money on it, i'd have been severely disappointed.the sleeve has all the pap you'd expect from label promoters, talking about how unbelievable and amazing the night of spinning was; but all i can think is, ""have you actually *listened* to this disc?""it's not great. it's not even that interesting.i heard the fatboy spin live once, and my reaction to that performance is the same as this: if he works on something in a studio, and takes months to do it, he's one of the best in the world.with two turntables live, he's just another hack."
2,A Lackluster Performance . . . .,"""Live on Brighton Beach"" covers ""The best night of my Life""(in Norman Cook's actual words) through a 70 minute mix of what i call ""boring funky dance tunes"". I listened to the CD once, and most likely will never listen to it again. I am a sucker for live cds; I love them to death. Whether they be techno,trance,or funky house - I usually buy them. But kids - stay away from this mainstream disc - it simply is not good. The journey starts off stellar with tracks by Underworld, Fatboy himself, and Santos. Somewhere in the middle of all this funk - I got bored. Repetitive beats and a boring mixing style made it almost unlistenable. The last 3 tracks on the cd, and ""SAFETY WARNING"" interruption were cool, but that is about it. Check out Mixed Live:Donald Glaude, or DJ DAN - In Stereo, or perhaps Chemical Brothers - Come with Us. But whatever you do - stay away from this."
4,real life live mix it is!,"Well, this is the first official live release for Mr. Cook. It is released on his own label - Southern Fried, and is a portion of the show from Brighton Beach held during the summer of 2001. Unfortunately this release does have it's low points. First of all, and maybe I'm just picky but, the tracklist is incorrect listing some tracks as individual tracks despite the fact that they are not (Note: the CDDB/Gracenote entry for this recording is also wrong.). During the middle of the set, the music stops for a public safety announcement (it seems the tide was coming in but the crowd wasn't moving). Despite these set backs the set is good. While I don't appreciate all of the tracks, particularly his own (Star 69, Sunset) there are some killers (Jark Prongo, The Clumps, Love Tattoo). I gave this disc a 4 out of 5 because of the tracklist errors and the inclusion of some less than impressive tracks."
2,"Quit your day job, Norman.","Put 35,000 people on a beach. Have a celebrity DJ play music at them for an hour. Release the result as a new album.This album isn't really anything like any of Fatboy Slim's other live sets - in that it's not actually very good. It starts off with a nice, slow mix of Born slippy, progressing into a nicely funky remix of Right here, right now... and goes downhill from there. Vocal samples that are louder than the music playing are randomly dropped into the mix and repeated for minutes at a time, the sound stops entirely for ten minutes or so while Norman mumbles things at the crowd (""get the hell away from the water!""), and half of what's played seems to be either from Halfway between the gutter and the stars or You've come a long way, baby.However, I don't like Fatboy Slim all that much. His ""K-Roc solid state"" mix is a better example of what he's capable of."
3,"Nice style, but not as sturdy as they used to be.","My husband is a big Marnier fan and has wanted a hat for a long time. Although this had is nicely styled the sturdiness of the hat is a lot less than it was when he was growing up. The bill is a little bit on the flimsy side making it hard to shape. If you still like to shape your bill and not wear it flat, then this hat may not be the best choice. If flat-billed hats are your thing, this hat will do the trick. Logo and coloring was great."
3,Excellent audio and video quality... But The Great Piano Man BIG HITS are missing!!!,"Expected to get a better version of the ""BJ Live at Yankee Stadium"", but I wasn't lucky.I think this concert was performed somewhere in Europe (Austria, Germany or Switzerland) so the great Piano Man sure performed the songs that became great hits there.That's why a lot of his real best Hits (for American fans) are missing... Anyway is a good concert, audio and video quality are Okay..."
4,bj fan,can someone give me a good enough reason why billy does not want to release more of his live preformances?
2,Broke nearly immediately,One luggage tag snapped on arrival on my overseas trip and the other broke on return. Not exactly what i would consider durable products.
4,Nice book,"I love this book, but some of the outfits don't fit the right doll. They fit the other doll, but the main doll doesn't have as many outfits."
5,Il mercante di stelle,"Il mercante di stelle is a very beautiful song the Renato Zero's voice is great and magic! I would like to listen this wonderful song by the voice of Celine Dion, Bryan Adams and Whitney Houston becouse the music is a dream!!Great Renato"
4,Casio Women's Pathfinder,"I give it 4 stars because its a nice ladies watch, BUT don't be fooled into thinking this watch has a compass, altimeter, or barometer. It only has a temperature reading, which is adversely effected by WEARING the watch, and a cool back-light system that can be activated by turning your wrist.In addition to being an attractive watch for an athletic type lady, IT KEEPS GREAT TIME!!!"
1,They mailed this one in.,"This was a very disappointing ending to one of the best roleplaying series I've ever seen. The first three books built things up to appear as though there would be a confrontation in the modern nights, but this epilogue ignores that entirely. Maybe the showdown will appear with the Time of Thin Blood or other Year of the Reckoning titles, but the final showdown should've happened here. Sure, storytellers can whip one up, but trying to cap the previous three books with a homebrew scenario smacks of hubris.Anyway, the previous reviewer has good info on what's in it. I'm just disappointed with what isn't in it."
4,Great toy but with supervision,My son loves this toy. I only had one problem with it my son put his foot through it. I was able to free him but it took some work getting it off of him. I held him while my husband was taking it off of him. I still let him play with it but I make sure it goes no where near his feet.
2,Nothing special,"I bought this for my 8 month old who had a triangle toy similar to this. This toy is very durable as she will swat at it a few times and then throw it off her highchair and it is still intact. She is not very stimulated by this as there is really nothing that excites her about this product. I think it could have more than just a mirror that spins. The cylinder with the beads is not very exciting either. Overall it was just so so and considering the price, I would not recommend."
4,Perhaps better for earlier than 9 months,"Purchased for 1 year old, but it was a bit too late for this toy (my fault). I felt most of the activities would have been more appreciated in much earlier months such as mirror, rain maker, abacus (even though product suggests 9 months). The only side my 1 year old plays with is the flat round disk with the two finger impressions. He plays with it like dialing a rotary phone. None of the other sides keeps his interest as he is familiar with its motions. Also, the orange disk that is supposed to run up and down a screw-like pole broke off. The toy is actually 1.5 lbs; I weighed it on a food scale. It will hurt if dropped on toes (big or small). Oh, and no batteries required, even though product describes batteries needed."
3,Not as fun as the Infantino Triangle,"I bought this to take on a plane trip and ended up storing in checked baggage due to the size. The toy itself is more of a pinkish/purplish than the red/blue in the pic. My son thinks its ok and I will only see him play with the cube if I initiate it. He is 9 months and cannot spin the large circle, an adult has to insert their fingers to work it. The ""rainmaker"" feature is a fail. The tiny beads are stuck to the side due to static. I suggest the Infantino Triangle because we had a chance to play with one at a local indoor play place. It had quite a few more activities, and the ""rainmaker"" actually worked."
5,My son loves this!,This is a very entertaining toy. My 9 month old son loves each side of it. The toy is light enough for him to pull it on his lap to play with. Each side has many things to move and spin. Highly recommended!
4,Box recommended age is 9 months,"Length:: 1:24 MinsI bought this for my 7 month old who was learning to sit on her own. She seemed to like boxes -- diaper wipe box, kleenex box, etc -- so I thought this would be a definite hit. For the first month, she was definitely interested in it but it didn't hold her attenton for more than a few minutes -- perhaps she wasn't at the recommended age? I still thought it was pretty cool though and I don't know how a baby's arm could get stuck in this (as somebody else wrote) -- My baby never had a problem with that. The item description says that it requires 2 AA batteries but I don't think that's correct as there is definitely no battery compartment on this cube!This video was taken when she was about 9 months old. There are 3 sides she likes more than the others and she will pretty much only plays with those 3 sides. Now just hitting 11 months, she will play with this on occassion but only for a couple of minutes before she finds something else more exciting."
4,Great Activity Cube,"I bought this for my son when he was 5mo.s old. I pulled it out for him at 6mo.s and he had no iterest. I pulled it out again at 7mo.s and he LOVES it. It really works his hand eye coordination. It is small enough so now that he is sitting up, he can move it around and change it to what interests him at the moment. It has been really good for his independent play time."
1,Cheap,"This item is very cheaply made, like a toy from the dollar store. There are some small beads on one side that made me concerned due to the quality, they could come off and be a hazard. Upon all these things I opted to return the toy."
5,Perfect for those that despise Valentine's Day (like me),"This book is the perfect answer to the age old question ""Why do you hate Valentine's Day?"" The sarcasm and humor with which this is written is a welcome change from all the self-help, love is all you need sap that is out there. For everyone that enjoys this book, I would also recommend the ""Self-Destruction Handbook"" for another good laugh and an answer to all the self-help guides littering bookstore shelves."
3,A bloodless account.,"This book has all the virtues--and all the vices---of academic history. The facts are all there and the professor is admirably fair and balanced, so hard to find when the French Revolution is the subject at hand, but where's the passion? I confess I found myself constantly checking how many pages to go as I neared the end of these over four hundred dry pages. This is a book for the student more than the general reader looking for the passion behind the facts, or for exciting narrative. At the end I was happier to have finished than to have read this book."
4,The Oxford History of the French Revolution,"An excellent book which brings clarity to the confusing and chaotic events which constitute the French Revolution. Some readers may find the book too detailed, but I think that the author has done a fine job in weaving the overall story out of these details. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in modern revolutions."
2,Too dense!!,"As a student reading this book for a class focusing on the French Revolution I found it too dense for someone who has no previous knowledge of the revolution. Doyle packs A LOT of information into these 425 pages. He does not place emphasis on any particular people or events which makes understanding specific turning points difficult. However, I can imagine this book would be ideal for one who already has a thorough understanding of the French Revolution and is simply looking for a new perspective."
5,Product Details,"Cover : Model And Cheerleader Lauren Michelle HillPlaymate : Nichole Van CroftInterview : Bob Costas20 Questions : Michael JohnsonPictorials : Of Heat And Hedonismat Jamaica's Latest Club, Guests Live Out Their Steamiest Fantasies.Features : It's All Hype, Playboy's Pigskin Preview, Toon In!Publication Date: October 2000"
5,Great Book!!!,This is probably the most interesting and fascinating book that I have read in years! I love it and I sincerely suggest anyone to buy this book.
1,Here's a thought...,"Hmmmm- just as a wild off the cuff idea before you get too wrapped up in the author's opinions, why not just drink water? I haven't heard of too many people becoming ill from it - unless they're drowning, of course."
4,Good-bye Sweet Elixir,"4 Stars for the research and thorough communication about this addictive toxin. The fifth star was withheld because of the verbosity, repetitive, disjointed writing style. To be fair, she did sub-title this a ""journey"" so the comments about her marriage are not entirely out of place, but still they don't seem germane to the main topic of Aspartame.Still, I am grateful to her. I am one month free of the stuff now and already feeling better. Making the mental shift to, ""it is poison"" has made all the difference for me."
5,"If you eat, you must read this book!","I've told all my friends about this book. We have all learned so much! My son, a diabetic, and only 11 years old, knows all about nutrasweet and chooses not to have any! He drinks water instead. He may have diabetes, but he is healthy! I shop in a natural health food store now that refuses to carry any products with nutrasweet."
5,Everyone should read this!,"Aspartame and all the other chemical sweeteners truly are making us sick. I quit using it 15 years ago when I was having blurry vision & headaches. I imagined I had cancer or some other horrible disease but no, I had built up a toxicity to Aspartame, and it was making me extremely ill!Aspartame, Sucralose, Phenyalenaline, Nutrasweet, Splenda are in so many food items now, but if you watch labels closely, it is not that hard to delete it from your world and feel a zillion times better. Just eat real sugar, it's natural. The Pharmaceutical industry is getting rich from chemical sweeteners. Don't support the declining health of America and the world!Great book, worth reading."
1,Unsubstantiated drivel,"What drivel from an uneducated, arrogant ""know-it-all""! Hull uses her ""expose"" as much to bash her unfortunate ex-husband as to gripe about all manner of nonsense. There are many excellent books written on the topic of the dangers of Aspartame ingestion. This self-serving, unsubstantiated garbage is not one of them."
5,A Must Have on Celtic Spirituality,"This book would be a great starting point for those interested in exploring the realms of Celtic Magic. Ms. Knight covers Shamanism, the Celtic Gods and Goddesses, the Druids (including a brief description of the Ogham, a Celtic form of tree divination), the Faeries, and modern Celtic Traditions. She includes several visualizations and some sample rituals. She also talks about Celtic Wicca, which I didn't actually think was necessary; for me the Celtic lore would have been enough, but of course this would be an added plus for those interested in following the Wiccan path.She also has a recommended reading list and a list of favorite Celtic music titles which I found to be very helpful.Ms. Knight's writing is enjoyable and easy to read, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone wishing to explore the Celtic path."
5,"Best book I've read lately about the Celts, Faery, & Druids","This book is the best book I've read lately about the Celts, Faery, Druids, Celtic Gods, and Celtic Wicca. Sirona Knight covers all of these subjects in-depth and with intelligence. She obviously spent a great deal of time writing this book, and the information in it is both scholarly and experiential. She writes about the origins of the Celts, who the Druids and Faery are, and she also gives plenty of hands-on exercises. I have read many other books by this author, and each one of them is intelligent, articulate and very thought provoking. If you are interested in Celtic subjects and facts, read this book first!"
5,Has Everything,"I really couldn't put this book down. It covered everything from Celtic, to Wicca to the Fey.The visualizations at the end of each chapter are exceptional.I plan to use them very soon.It was a very enjoyable read."
5,"Celtic Traditions: Druids, Faeries and Wiccan Rituals","I found this book to be a great read and very informative. I read a lot of books on Celtic history, culture, and traditions. This book did not disappoint. It came in a timely manner and packaged very securely."
1,I am so angry I bought this book,"This woman has the writing skills of a high school dropout. Some sentences are written so badly I had to read them again just to make sure they were in English. For some reason I thought this was a serious book about the Celtic revival phenomenon instead, I found out it was just another new age junk book filled with clichés, gross generalizations and non-sequiturs. Here is a classic example (pp. 29-20)""Matriarchal order and lineages stem from the early concept that creation comes from women. Creation is a divine seed, stemming from the Mother. Plainly, the mother's identity is always certain while the father's is not...""I want my money back."
3,One side of the story,"Its a good book telling the story of Alcatraz from a guards point of view. I enjoyed Reading it, but it is colored by the fact that it is written by a guard, who thinks that the only cruelty ón Alcatraz was boredom and the cruelty the inmates did to eachother . All in All a good book about a terribel place."
3,ok,According to the seller the book i purchased was new but i found an autograph by the author to some girl name Kelly. Other than that the book was in good condition.
1,incorrect description,The description says this book is in English. IT IS IN FRENCH!!!! Dont be fooled by the info!!
3,"Interesting, but distractingly biased","As he did with Into Thin Air, John Krakuer comes at the story in UTBOH with a firm, unwavering bias. While his reporting and storytelling are to be commended, it is quite clear early on that Krakauer views the Mormom church and its members skepticism. His description of the church's founding and rise to prominence is painted with tongue-in-cheek innuendo. And why the need to spend 100 pages on the church's rise to prominence? Could not the same information be relayed in half the length?ALl in all, though, UTBOH is an arresting piece of nonfiction, highly relevant in today's world. Krakauer is at his best when telling stories (as opposed to retracing the steps of history). Worth the read, despite the Mormon church's claims otherwise."
4,Eye-Opening,"Krakauer is an excellent author with an engaging writing style. The true events recounted in this book are eye-opening, disturbing, fascinating, and prove that truth is stranger than fiction."
1,Anti-Mormon Non-Sense,"Every now and again this type of black journalism shows its ugly head. They go out of their way to attack Maverick Mormons. The writer tries to blame the Smart girl's kidnapping on the Mormons. The guy who did the kidnapping was just a crazy street ""Jesus"" who had no connections to any Mormon group.John Singer was gunned down by the police while he was walking to his mail box, this makes him a Mormon terrorist.To get a book published now days they have to support the Big Lie. This book is trash. Wyatt Kaldenberg"
1,Less than Accurate,"The content of this book is less than accurate and does not delve deeply or fairly enough into the complete history of early and current ""Mormonism"". If you are well studied in this subject you'll notice there are numerous factual faults and obvious over-generalizations. Mike Otterson, the director for the LDS Church's media relations has said ""...Krakauer unwittingly puts himself in the same camp as those who believe every German is a Nazi, every Japanese a fanatic, and every Arab a terrorist."" Krakauer admittedly does not understand religious devotion and thus has not and cannot handle this complicated subject."
5,Mind-Boggling Historical Account,This book is a must read for anyone interested in reading a non-biased historical account of the Latter Day Saints. The parallel of events which occurred in the development of Mormanism as compared to the development of Islam are of a striking similarity.Jon Krakauer is truly an amazing author and story teller.
5,Thought-provoking,"Krakauer has written a typically intelligent and well balanced account of the violent roots of Mormon fundamentalism. This well structured book demonstrates how the violence and extremism found in some of today's fringe Mormon groups is connected to Mormonism's beginnings via a thread of violence that lends a certain perverse logic to the occasional violence of modern Mormon fundamentalists. It's a very interesting read, and it conveys very effectively a fundamentalist mindset that can be extrapolated to fundamentalist religions of all types, not only Mormonism."
3,"Well-Written, but Lacking Substance","Jon Krakauer is a gifted writer--Into Thin Air and Into the Wild were outstanding books. His literary skills are on display in Under the Banner of Heaven, but the central story in the book, the Lafferty murders, doesn't get nearly enough of the space. Only about a third or so of this book is dedicated exclusively to the case, with the remainder dedicated to the history of Mormonism.Knowing the history of this sect is certainly important for putting the Lafferty murders in perspective, but I felt like insufficient attention was paid to the point of the book. Specifically, I wanted to know the effect the murders had on the community generally and Allen Lafferty specifically. Without reading the book, this may sound a bit ghoulish, but after reading it, I think you'll want to have the same questions answered--or at least raised.All in all, Under the Banner of Heaven is a good book, but not Krakauer's best."
4,What about the boys?,"Under the Banner of Heaven is a thoughtful, evenhanded examination of Mormonism, its history, and its current status. Jon Krakauer explores in detail the split between the mainline Mormons, who have renounced polygamy, and the fundamentalists, who continue to practice it. The impact of the fundamentalists is shown through the story of the murders of a woman and her baby.The only lack that I noticed was, what happens to the young men, most of whom will not be designated as candidates for marriage within the community because the young women are all handed off to the old men. Certainly, the old men are not likely to want the young ones around because they would be competition. I have heard a rumor that they are expelled from the community shortly after puberty, which would make sense, but it is such a shocking allegation that I am reluctant to believe it."
5,an eye opener,"This book has been reviewed nearly to death but I'd like to add my 1 cents. Two things struck me while reading this fascinating and frightening work.First, it's an excellent combination of history and current events within the LDS church. Of course, there is a lot more to Mormonism than what Krakauer is able to cover here but what there is is covered well. The murders that form the hub of the book are at the same time almost tangential to the story. This is really a cold, hard look into the locked closets and under (and into) the beds of a very strange religion.Second, I'm dumbfounded at the number of people who are taken in by a religion that was dreamed up by a character like Joseph Smith. The guy was a obvious fraud; a combination of carnival huckster, Mohammad, and David Koresh. Likewise for Brigham Young."
5,The Genesis of Religion,"A fascinating account into the beginnings of the Mormon faith. I found it fascinating because, (as the book noted), this is a new religion and one is able to separate reality from myth (unlike other religions where the passage of time has left us with only the latter)."
3,Under the Banner of Heaven,"Found this book to be historical, yet incomplete as it pertains to modern day LDS members. It was heavy on plural marriages and underage girls practiced by the Fundamentalist LDS."
4,Tale of Murder and Mormon Fundamentalism,"Krakauer's delivers a graphic tale that mixes a brutal familial double homicide with Mormon fundamentalist siblings. An interesting exploration of the violent crime and its underpinnings and aftermath. -- R. Barri Flowers, criminologist and bestselling author of THE SEX SLAVE MURDERS: The True Story of Serial Killers Gerald and Charlene Gallgo."
2,"Worthwhile subject, substandard writing","I really admired Mr. Krakauer's last two books, so hoped I could give this one a 5-star rating as well, but find that I just can't. It just plain isn't written very well. His previous efforts were very personal; we got to know the characters as 3-dimensional people. But in this volume Krakauer stands back - sometimes very far back. This is particularly true in the later Mormon history chapters when the more fully developed characters of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young are out of the picture. I got a little bored with his throwing out names of people we don't know and won't hear about further in order to illustrate violent events. These events began to sound very similar to each other..offering us little more to chew on than a thin chronology.Clearly, ""standing back"" is not the author's forte. But I'll give him two stars for taking a risk and tackling this potentially worthwhile subject matter."
2,"Oh, please","Oh for goodness sakes.""A Story of Violent Faith""So of course, I'm impressed that some western person has been curious enough to look into a ""violent faith"" and accurately report on the illiberal and degrading practices of Islam.No, this book is not about Islam.It's about some offshoot-Mormons.Real courageous there, Krakauer.Interesting compilation of Joseph Smith's history, woven all through the book. Good angle on the Elizabeth Smart case -- lurid tabloid reading! On the whole, not worthwhile reading."
1,Disappointed,"I loved Into Thin Air but this book is a big disappointment. Not only do I have several Mormon friends but I know enough about the religion to know he is way off. If you want to really know about Mormonism ask a Mormon, not a bitter crime-seeking non-religious man. (And comparing Mormons to the Taliban is just down right wrong.)"
2,My kingdom for a point...,"Much like the Mormon faith, Under the Banner of Heaven has an infrastructure of oatmeal. This book, at best, strengthens the resolve of those who love and those who loathe the LDS movement."
2,"Great writer, horrible journalist!","I just finished this book. Let me start off by saying that I am mormon. I was curious to read the book to understand what the fundamentalists view is. However, I was dissapointed. I knew that he would get some facts wrong about the Mormon church, everyone does. But he got everything wrong. He's taken sources from history that are anti-mormon and cited them as facts. If he cites false documents, it doesn't make his document truth. I was hoping for a better representation of what we believe, instead he's taken the opportunity to express his views on Mormon's regardless of the truth.Krakauer's writing style is excellent and compelling and hard to put down. But he's short on facts. In fact, he was criticized for the same thing in his books ""into the wild"" and ""into thin air"". He keeps doing it again and again. He's more interested in controversy to sell his books then telling the truth."
2,Soapbox material,"This is an intelligent author who writes with clarity, can tell a good story and pays attention to the details. However, he beats the reader up with his opinion of religion, not even slightly between the lines. Clearly he thinks that religious faith is about as intelligent as believing in Santa Claus but is considerably more destructive, or potentially destructive. Sure he has a right to his opinion and even has a right to compose a book on the subject. I resent however that he attempts to disguise this opinion in the cloak of journalism. Interesting that he chose Mormonism as his example and only briefly refers to ""Evangelical Christians"" and Catholics. I think he must have recognized that if he went after faith, rather than a cultic tragedy he would not have sold books and would have alienated too many people. It is too bad that an author capable of solid journalism stoops to such tactics."
3,Compelling but biased,"I am not Mormon, let me go ahead and say that. I found this book to be well written and immensely compelling, but I was consistently put off by Krakauer's language, which is at best biased and at worst inflammatory. I guess I was expecting a more journalistic style, but his use of adjectives with negative connotations is widespread -- and primarily confined to his description of Mormons. Quite often I would have to stop and figure out what something would have sounded like if written objectively. The difference is vast and would probably have resulted in a less saleable, less marketable book. So read... but bring your grains of salt and do not expect an objective account."
3,tough story,"This book came highly recommended. I chose the audio version for my commutes to work. This was a deeply disturbing book. That polygamy, which I view as sanctioned pedophilia, is so present in cults throughout the USA, and so difficult to prosecute, was hard to ""stomach."" This book delineated some of the differences between Christianity and extremists of any faith. One of the things Jesus came for, is to reveal to us, who God the father is and what he is like. ""Love your enemies, Do Good to those who persecute you, forgive 70 times 7 times,"" etc. Those murderers of 9/11, and those of these stories, know nothing of God the Father. The telling of this story was pretty dry. the history of LDS and Joseph Smith was a bit ""textbook"" like. Generally, the book was informative, but not ""my cup of tea!"""
3,Been there...read that...,"As a fan of Jon Krakauer's previous books, and as someone very interested in Mormon history and polygamy, I have to say that I found this book basically...well, a bore. I was hoping to learn something new and this book was nothing more than a summarization of numerous other books and magazine/news articles. I also felt strongly that this book lacked a sense of direction. Was it about Mormon history, the contemporary Mormon church, or polygamy? I hoped it would be about polygamy, the Lafferty's, and life in Colorado City (now that would be a great book), but those chapters were incredibly superficial and short. The chapters about Mormon history and the contemporary church have all been done before! I would say, if you've never read anything about Mormons, pick up this book--you'll most likely find it interesting. If you've read more than 1 or 2 books on the topic, save your money, you've already read it."
4,Loved this book!,"This was the first book that I've read on Mormonism in general and fundamentalist Mormons in particular. I loved the historical background and found it relevant to the current crisis that we're experiencing with Islamic terrorists.Krakauer's writing style is smooth and articulate. He tackled a diffucult subject and made it easy to grasp and interesting (scary, too!!)However, I was confused at the end when Krakauer said that he grew up with Mormons and had a great deal of respect for them. I didn't get that impression from the book, which I felt was a scathing endictment of both the radicals and the mainstream Mormons. He even ends the book by saying that inter-racial marriage is condemned by the church. Sexist, racist, and inflammatory? Krakauer made me think twice about the Mormon church and I wondered what all his admiration was based on.Sigrid M."
4,At times it needs a little more focus,"A very well intentioned book with one main problem Krakauer can never decide where exactly to place the Lafferty Murders in the narrative therefore whatever issue about the nature of Mormonism is being discussed is always cut short and refocused to some kind of vague tie in that relates to these gruesome murders at least in the mind of the author.So the narrative will be clipping along and you will be very interested in a particular aspect the Golden Plates, The Sons of Ham, plural marriage or the fact that in spite of the LDS's claim to the contrary there have always been competing factions within Mormonism and all of the sudden you will be back on the murders with no idea of how exactly the author bought you to that point. This is at times tragic because while it is a very well researched book at times its subject matter was so broad it felt like it was two or three books in one. This leads on my part to both feelings of confusion and a desire to hear more."
4,"Not the Best Krakauer, but Worth the Read","After reading Into the Wild and Into Thin Air, I was on edge, waiting for this one to be released. I was not disappointed, although this book did not hold me like the previous two did. Rather than focusing on the murders, it rather became a historical rendition of Mormonism and the Fundamentalists that arose from the Mormon ranks. The information was detailed, informative, and at times, surprising and unbelievable, but the story of the crime itself gets buried in the textbook-like history.I would recommend this book to others, but caution that the book is not exactly as it is advertised. It will not keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat as his previous works did, but it shows an unbiased, true to life picture of religion and the consequences that can arise from the fanatics that are a part of every group we have."
5,REVIEWS FROM UTAH....,"Folks,Since I'd already read the book I wrote a review first, as a former Mormon (apostate, they call me). Then I read all 301 reviews.I'd say Jon's rating, right now a four-star, is one helluva a rating, given that there was virtually no middle ground - ones and twos averaged with fives.Another *very* interesting thing I noted was how many negative reviews came from cities and towns mentioned in Joh's book (especially American Fork, UT). Looks like you hit a nerve, Joh!! Good for you...........larry fullmer"
4,Great Summer Reading,"This is an interesting title which is highly relevant to anyone who lives in the Western U.S.. The content is well researched and the writing excellent. Anyone who has ever wondered about the actual private beliefs of the Mormons (as opposed to the nonsense that's endlessly spewed in their ridiculous television promos) will find this book a worthwhile read.Why only four stars? While I can't really criticize the content of Krakauer's research or writing, the books themselves are not indexed well and the quality of the paper and binding is very poor."
3,Very good,"Just finished this one last night. Excellent read. Be forewarned this is not a thrill-ride like ""Thin Air"" or a moving character study like ""Into the Wild."" This book is more like a True Crime book laced with an extensive history of the Mormon church. Krakhauer does a great job telling the sordid history of this strange religion (no offense, but ALL religions are pretty strange to me.) I loved true crime classics like Helter Skelter, In Cold Blood and the Executioner's Song, and would rank this book right up there with those. Not quite as chilling as Helter Skelter, but still the completely disconnected lack of remorse that the Lafferty's had in this book, really made me sick.Krakhauer is great a mixing his superb research with his own excellent story-telling voice.This book illustrates the incredible negative potential of brainwashing via religion.Only reason for the 3 stars is that it did bounce around a bit at times causing some disorientation on my part."
5,Good God Almighty!,"John Krakaur is a genius when it comes to making nonfiction read like fiction. By far the best at doing this that I have read. This book is enthralling and filled with information about the fundamentalist Mormon movement as well as the origins of the Mormon faith in general. While I know that all organized religions have their skeletons, the fact that Mormonism is relatively modern (late 19th C) makes its history all the more titillatingly bizarre.Learned alot. While most will agree there is a bias against Mormons, I think it is a bias against any organized religion. In fact, I think he even states this if I recall correctly. Well, biases or no, I thought Krakaur hid them extremely well."
3,Interesting history of the Mormon Church. Unfair to paint today's followers with the brush of the past.,"I am fascinated with different religious sects and I must admit that the Mormon Church has always seemed to be founded on bizarre circumstances by some questionable characters. This book kept my interest and the history of the founders was interesting and disturbing. I soon became confused with the geneology of the family members of the FLDS in Colorado and Utah. No wonder genealogy is so important to the Mormon's how else could the keep up with their blood lines.I don't think that it is fair to paint todays LDS members with the same brush as the FLDS and the early ""church"" which I think the author is attempting to do. Unfortunately, the majority who are good citizens with a strong (admirable) sense of family are tainted by the few whackos who make all the news."
3,20 pages is enough,"I thought this book was going to be intriguing throughout, however, I felt the accounts within were too much for my stomach to take. Young girls married to older men and pregnant by 16 without choices or education -- so sad. While the subject turned out to be a bit sickening, the writing was fine and reporting excellent. I kept waiting for the stories of those women who ""go out."" I would rather spend my time with something a little more cheerful. You may have a different experience."
2,A hodge podge of gruesome stories. Waste of time.,"The historical information is grossly inaccurate. Not a single footnote on numerous items completely out of step with all the professional historical work on the subject, but stated as facts. The narrative jumps back and forth to different stories and centuries with no apparent logic or flow. excessively lurid details of the murders. He is apparently trying to say religion causes violence, but never compares the quantity of religious violence vs violence caused by other things. His argument is absurd and not at all supported by this book."
2,"Disjointed and Biased, even if you agree with him...","One can tell going in that Krakauer had a negative view of Mormons to begin with. Rather than making his research do the talking, Krakauer's opinions do the talking, and to me this made him less credible. As a person who agrees with some of his biases, even I was offended by his tactlessness. The story itself was disjointed as well, and I kept having to return to previous pages to understand who was who and what was what. If you want good solid Krakauer, read ""Into the Wild"" (my personal favorite of his) or ""Into Thin Air."" In them, at least he does not let his opinions get in the way of his research so blatantly unless he is a part of the story himself (""Into Thin Air"")."
3,"""Belief in God is Irrational""","This book is certainly well-written and fairly informative. Those who think it is an attack on the Latter-day Saint (Mormon) religion miss the author's point. This book is an attack on ALL religion and ALL belief in the divine. The author states it only twice, but he states it clearly -- All belief in God is irrational and leads to awful consequences."
1,"Ho hum, what a boring muddle.","Having read many of Krakauer's other books I was eager to get down to this one. What a disappointment. He calls it a story (on the cover) but it's not a story at all - more like a painfully dull history of the Mormon faith, and a slanted one at that. This book misses on both levels - too boring and scattered to be a good story, too biased to be a history."
3,Under The Banner of Heaven,"This title plods along with the pace of the wagon trains of that era never revealing absolute reality and truths but the same myths that have prevailed for many years. This is not the stuff of his early work ""Into Thin Air"", perhaps only one terrific book per author is within his ability. In short disjointed and very little excitement inside the cover."
3,"Interesting topic, too many details","I wanted to love this book, but I wound up just liking it. Krakauer is a great writer, the topic was impeccably researched, and the subject is fascinating. But, I feel like for the non-historian reader, many of the details could have been left out. There are hundreds of names, places, and small events that don't add much to the story other than increased difficulty.Another small complaint is about the footnotes. This is just a personal preference, but I find frequent large footnotes to be distracting. I feel obligated to read them, but that breaks up the continuity of the main text. I much prefer when writers incorporate the info into the main text or just put the notes at the end of the book.That said, anyone interested in a more detailed view of the history of Mormonism will be satisfied by this exposition. There are some shocking tidbits about the origins of Mormonism as well as some profound tie-ins with religion in general."
5,"Insanely funny, informative and interesting.","Sometimes I really get tired of Krakauer. Everything he publishes is awesome. He's like the kid in class that always knows the right answer, is rich and good-looking. Can he just go away already?!So, predictably, this is another really fantastic book by the Author. I learned a lot about Mormons and had a great time doing it. I regretted the book coming to an end. It's hard to put down it's so entertaining."
4,A Favorite,"Jon Krakauer's non-fiction is my favorite. He digs deeply into the past to explain the present.His other books, especially ""Where Men Find Glory,"" have moved me to tears.This one seemed to bog down in a lot of crazy rhetoric from splinter groups of the Mormon church.The book is enlightening, but not as much a personal story as previous books."
5,Wow - couldn't put it down,"While some details are hard to stomach, I found it a page-turner and hard to put down. I have close Mormon friends and grew up Protestant in the South. We agree to respect each others position and leave it at that. With that said, I found some of the history of the church complelling. I enjoyed the book and have recommended it many times to others."
4,As a born-and-raised Mormon ...,"I must admit that Mr. Krakauer's coverage of Mormon history is fairly accurate. While what he says is far from what the Latter-day Saints would like you to know about. My own church has never really admitted any involvement in the Mountain Meadows killings of over 100 civilians from Arkansas even though every Mormon involved in that terrible event had been into the Church's temple cerimony where they repeatedly swore vengence on the blood (decendants) of those responsible for the death of their prophets. Their last prophet before this event was killed in Arkansas. Yes, Mr. Krakaur needed to write this book."
5,"Well balanced, interesting read","This book does an excellent job of describing and investigating the motivations behind the murders that occurred in 1984. Even though the book delves into church doctrines, one does not need to know much about the Mormon faith to easily follow along. Mr. Krakauer touches on many topics that many of the Mormon faithful would like to see erased from history as they are either quite damaging to their public relations campaign or are just too difficult to explain."
1,The power of finding out for yourself,"Whether we agree that what is written in this book is the truth or not, we all have the ability to find out for ourselves what is the truth and what is embellishment. Controversary always stirs curiosity, and brings about questions. We have read one man's opinions based on a few statments from others. There are thousands of journals, books, and records that tell the story of the early mormon church. Find out the whole story, not just portions. What really happened? Will you believe the statement of one or of many? Use your power to find out the truth and ask questions! Then the true power of writing will come to pass."
1,Disappoint,The author treads no new ground. The book relies on second hand sources to try and expose the Latter-day Saint Church. Not until the last paragraph of the book does the author finally confess his own bias. I felt the book was a cheap shot at the Mormon Church and its members.
1,Non-fiction?,"Anyone who accepts this book as fact should read the review available at [...]. This review points out errors and biases that are more than ""small errors (as one reviewer stated).""Krakauer, who may have some strengths as a author, states his biases in the introduction. Why would I accept as fact a book written about a group by someone who has an axe to grind about that group? If those seeking reliable information about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints read only this book, they are being about as fair and objective as learning about general Christianity from Richard Dawkins. You might, in forming an opinion, touch on Dawkins, but you wouldn't want to form conclusions on Christianity from Dawkins alone. That wouldn't be honest. Krakauer missed badly in this one."
1,Disappointed,"Krakauer uses the same arguments that have existed for decades, only this time around they have been given the spin that it all leads to violence. I was not entertained in the least. I found myself becoming bored, disinterested, and with little motivation to complete the book.Sorry Jon, stick with Everest."
3,"Good, helpful, but . . .","Krakauer's journalistic skills are impeccable. This is well researched and clearly written. However, I found it a little distracting to follow the switching back and forth from present day events to early LDS history. Admittedly though, a grasp of the history is necessary to understand the origin of the aberrant mind set of the entire LDS cult/culture.As a Christian, I do take exception to Mr. Krakauer's lumping together of all persons of faith. He appears to consider the religious of any faith to be less than rational in that they believe in a power higher than oneself. That is close-minded at best, and certainly to be pitied.Overall the book is educational, informative and worth the time - especially to those of us who live in the area and have to deal with this on an unfortunately regular basis."
3,Not what I expected...,"I have read Krakauer's other books and found them very enjoyable, and quite frankly better organized. This was a difficult story to follow; the historical synopsis' of the Mormon's movement was interwined almost haphazardly between recent details of the murders that were the main focus of the book. I did find it informative, albeit one-sided, as I never really knew anything about the foundation of the Mormon religion. However, overall organization could have been improved. I personally hate Footnotes..and there were a ton of them! One or two sentence footnotes are ok to note a source or add backgroud info, but paragraphs that could have been chapters in themselves were very distracting."
5,What an incredible book.,"What an incredible book. Once you start reading it, you won't be able to set it down. I even got yelled at by my boss for reading the book on company time. I've read it 4 times and each time is like the first time. There is alot of information to process so get ready be blown away. It's awsome. Also, if you missed reading Tino Georgiou's masterpiece--The Fates, go and read it."
5,Yikes,"Krakauer has done exhaustive research, written a fascinating book and gotten me scared of this Mormon thing. Eeeuuww. Can't get behind the anti-women and anti-black/dark skin thing, sorry kids (closes the door on the missionaries). ""Oh yes, women are just here to pump out babies!"" Yeah right. Just got to remember, it's the extreme fundamentalists for the most part that are the nutbars. I've had some really great friends that are Mormon, so I must remember that.The parallels between these religious extremists and others elsewhere on the globe are unsettling.Krakauer sounds more agnostic than atheistic in his final remarks. Good job Jon (I enjoyed ""Into the Wild"" and ""Into Thin Air"" as well)."
5,Fundamentally Insightful,"Fascinating, meticulously researched, and fair-minded, this book offers insights about the dangers of all forms of fundamentalism."
4,Mormon history & murder in the name of God,"There are plenty(611 as this writing) of reviews of this book, including the editorials so you can get the basis for this book easily by reading them. Let me just add that I found it an incredibly fascinating read on the history of the Mornons, as well as the sects within. The tragic story of murder is not neccessarily sensationalisn but rather a poignant portrayl of religion gone wrong. Jon Krakauer is a very good writer, whose other books I have enjoyed and this one ranks way up there. The author tells a riveting story that unfortunatley is not fiction but true crime. This is another sad example of what man does in the name of God. Read this book if you want to know more about the Mormons and their more radical Fundamentalists offshoots."
4,"Absolutely brutal, but very informative.","This book really struck home for me. The story of the Lafferty family is one that reminds me greatly of how religion can completely blind somebody from logic and reason. Living in the heart of Mormon Utah, I can see where fundamentalists such as Rulon and Warren Jeffs, developed the base of their beliefs. Krakauer makes an excellent point about how the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints can take progressive steps towards worldwide acceptance if they just open up their archives and history and allow people to study them. Enough secrecy, enough cover ups, just be honest and tell us about the history of your religion. I agree with Krakauer that they can make a better name for themselves if they just open up a little. Overall, this book was one i'm glad I picked up. Although absolutely brutal at moments, it was very informative and deep. Great read!"
5,Incredible insight!!,Amazing insight into a popular religon in the American West. A must read for the curious. Sheds light onto a lifestyle under your very nose.
5,review,A great history of the faith. Caused excellent discussions among those I know who have read it. The author ties in history and personal accounts extremely well.
4,Helpful in understanding the Cult,"My sister converted to ""Mormonism"" when she married her husband. At first it was just so that she could raise her family with a religous based morale system. Yet the further she got involved in the church - the more I became convinced that it was a cult. I am not a theological based person - but Jon Krakauer's book was EXTREMELLY helpful in debating the pros and cons of the LDS system with her.Krakauer's book gives you a historical perspective of how the current church evolved since it's conception in the 1800's, why there are SO many different sects of a church being so young, and their belief system and explains the paradox's in the ""Book of Mormon""""Under the Banner"" is written with a different perspective than his previous novels and may seem boring. Krakauer's researched the church in depth and has made it very easy for an LDS outsider to try to understand the LDS cult - it is incredibly helpful!!!"
2,I waited too long Under the Banner of Heaven,"I am enthralled with the subject of Polygamy and this is a well written book . . . very clinical, informative, factual and dry book - which is why I gave it 2 stars. If the author had cut it down it would have earned three stars from me. I need just a little more heart and soul for me to grant it a better star rating. I enjoyed immensely the 19th wife. I understand this was not that kind of book, but I put this book away 60 pages from completing it, because it had lost my interest and that was not the case with the 19th wife, not even once."
2,just ok,"Ordered the book for a book club read, just not in to it. It feels more like a high school social studies read than a book club book."
2,damaged book,book arrived with many more writings on pages than expected. seller offered to refund purchase price which I hope to see on my next Credit Card statement. that would be excellent customer service
3,"Thorough, but ultimately disappointing.","I must say that I read this book because I have enjoyed Krakauer's other books. I found this dense, and at times repetitive. To me it was not as interesting, nor as readable, as his adventure books. That said, I admire what he has done to a large degree. The book is well researched and well written. I believe that the author tried to present an objective work, because he has lifelong friends who are Mormons and admires their rectitude, as he states in his notes. But as presented, the work does much to condemn Mormon Fundamentalism without saying so outright. If you like dense tomes dealing with religious history and extremism this book is for you, but if you don't, I recommend that you skip this one."
4,Mostly objective but with some gaps in the argment,"This is an interesting account of some extreme and violent people. Instead of treating them as isolated oddballs, Krakauer connects them to the history of the Church of Latter Day Saints. He presents that history fairly, covering some violent episodes that the LDS hierarchy would like us all to forget.Krakauer writes very well, though I thought the prose moved less well here than in his other books.The main challenge of this book is the gap between extremists and mainstream. Krakauer would like us to see the extremism of the Laffertys in the mainstream church, but the mainstream church has excommunicated these extremists. Obviously these extremists are a product of an LDS environment. Just as obviously, they rejected the LDS church and it rejected them. This raises more complicated questions of ""blame"" and ""responsibility"" than Krakauer really addresses."
3,Wasn't 'New' Condition As Advertised,I ordered this book as a gift and it came in with tattered edges and looking more used than new.
3,Love Jon Krakauer....no so much this book.,Received this book. Tried reading this. Was not able to keep my interest. This doesn't follow much of what the book says it will. It's really kind of stupid. Sorry.
3,Way Too Much Background Information,"A horrific crime is put into the context of religious fanaticism. Fanatics are generally uninteresting characters, as they were in this book. A fundamentalist had a revelation that he should kill various people. He follows God's will.The history of Mormonism is given in excruciating detail, providing no more insight into what happened than could be gleaned from understanding that in Mormonism, people are encouraged to communicate directly with God. And of course, those communications can't be empirically verified. And sometimes wacky people serve their own needs by claiming divine blessings.Krakauer is a thorough researcher. However, his subject matter bored me. And his writing style is choppy. He has many footnotes that should have been incorporated into his text."
3,Depends on what you're looking for,"I was surprised to have enjoyed ""Under the Banner of Heaven"" as it is not my typical pick. I usually enjoy true-crime subject matter, and in this genre, I was pleased with the story and the way it was written. I do, however, have some reluctance to recommend this book as a factual account of Mormonism. I am most suspicious of the generalizations made regarding the various sects of the LDS church and their beliefs. I find the manner in which Jon Krakauer presents this aspect of the book almost inciting and the people with whom he speaks to all be ""on one side of the fence"" in regards to their take on present of past experiences within the religion."
1,awful,"Horrible subject matter, difficult to follow and not enjoyable at all. I just plain made me mad that this could go on."
1,Under the Banner,"Under the BannerWay too long.I did learn something about the Morons. I must admit I didn't finish the book , I couldn't take the killing of innocent people.I don't believe God told them to kill people."
5,Brilliantly written,"This story is not a negative look at the current church of Latter Day Saints or even Smith himself, it is a well researched and highly readable book on a subject most would not even bother to delve into for any entertainment purposes, but it is vastly entertaining. Easy to read, easy to understand, the book clearly differs the peaceful current LDS church from the fundamentalists throughout the church's history. The fact that Krakauer has recieved multiple death threats since the publication of this book just drives home his point that in some cases, and some- not all as the author makes very clear, fundamentalism can lead to violence in the name of God."
4,"Well-written, in-depth look into the power of organized faith",A page turning look into the power of organized faith past and present. A must read.
4,Eyeopener,This was a book chosen by our book club. It sure created a lot of discussion in the parallels between the Taliban and religiously fanatic early Mormans. Krakauer did his usual thorough research and it was quite well written.
1,"If you want Bologna, look no further","The story is true, but exaggerated and important parts left out.Under the Banner of Heaven is a fictional account for faiths that would like to bash the Mormons."
1,Full of false claims,"This book is high on sensationalism but is starving for actual facts. I followed this case very closely and this guy is way off the mark. He should have spent more time with research of the case in question, rather than wasting it on his ridiculous accusations & conspiracy-type story-telling regarding the LDS church. The problem here is the it's obvious the author didn't feel like he could draw enough of an audience by just stating the facts of the case--instead he mistakingly believed he needed to drag in false claims regarding mainstream Mormons. Those who WANT to believe this garbage WILL, and those who are sensible and actually know LDS people and don't have a chip on their shoulders, will realize that this book IS GARBAGE. This isn't the first book of this kind to trash on the Mormon faith, and it won't be the last. Take my advice & just don't waste your time on it."
1,Review,Krakauer is highly confused and I can tell that so are some of these reviewers. He cannot give insight into or shed light on something he knows little truth about himself. The church he is talking about is completley separate from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Jon Krakauer is nothing more than an sadly misinformed and idiotic person trying to enlighten his readers with things he has misinterpreted. Books like these are written on every religion with hopes of discouraging the believers and proving to those that don't believe -that their assumptions were correct.
4,"Very timely, given TX events","Although I am only 30 pages into this book, which takes place primarily in Arizona, the details of previous raids on FLDS compounds are shockingly similar to what is currently happening in Eldorado, TX--including how the press is presenting this group as being persecuted for their religion when in fact, the FDLS is guilty of heinous crimes against its female members, who are little more than breeding stock. What FLDS members present to the networks and media may not be at all what goes on behind those locked and closed doors. Read this book."
1,At least he was kind enough to confess his bias - in the end,"Krakauer so masterfully intertwines fact with fiction that it is impossible to distinguish one from the other unless you posess a substantial background with which to decode his effort.He attempts to explore certain religions from the perspective of those who engage in abborrant behaviour not espoused by any religion he investigates.In the final few paragraphs Krakauer finally confesses what has already becomes dissapointingly, painfully obvious - he has no understanding of the concept about which he is writing - people of faith - any faith."
1,Poorly written,This is a poorly written book. Seems like the author just wanted to sell something and was in a hurry to put out a poor quality product.
1,"For anyone interested in a factual, well written book","For anyone interested in a factual, well written book... you'll have to look elsewhere I'm afraid. Mr. Krakauer has lost any shred of credibility he may have had and proven himself to be unconcerned with fact, data, truth, integrity and honesty.It's unfortunate that Jon Krakauer wasted so much precious time bashing a religion he obviously knows nothing about. It would be most interesting to find the true underlying cause for such bitterness."
1,Jon's got issues,"I totally understand the ""let's rip on the mormons"" thing. Everybody's doing it so good for Krakauer. It's a popular bandwagon after all. But now that he's gone and just really, really taken a shot at Greg Mortensen, i mean come on. Does this guy not have anything good to say? Anything at all?"
1,waste of time!!!,"this book told a good story, but i think he was just trying to get out of trouble! don't judge all mormons by one idiot! all my friends are mormons and are awesome! just cause one does something dumb, doesn't mean they all are stupid. what religion are most murders anyway?? i guarante they are not mormons!!!!!!"
1,Inaccuracies,"As a casual historian of the period covered in Krakauer's book, I am dismayed, even insulted, that a fellow author would twist and omit crucial facts about any group--mainstream or not. Had he included a balanced overview of events from credible (not sensationalism-type) sources, he would have had no story at all. Now I wonder about inaccuracies in ""Thin Air"". I've lost all respect for the author. Apparently not what he's ""Kraked"" up to be. Sad how quest for notierity and money clouds integrity."
2,Say What?,"Several reviewers have made the observation that the only harsh critics of this book are Mormons. Implied in the suggestion is that Mormons are too biased to offer analysis. Does this mean that Krakauer's agnostic worldview make him objective? Well does it?Does his admission that his failure to interview one representative of the LDS faith because, ""I knew what they would say,"" make his thesis more or less biased?My biased or unbiased view depending on the above (I am a Mormon) tells me upon my completion of Under the Banner of Heaven, that you could drive a truck through the holes in his thesis."
5,Awesome page turner,As always Jon Krakauer is awesome in his reporting! This is a hard to put down book. Understandably when you start probing into matters of faith you're going to rile up individuals. This will only strengthen their resolve.This book should inspire a federal investigation into the fundamentalists who are literally robbing U.S. citizens to support pedophilia and slavery in portions of the southwest. It's always good to look within our own borders for homegrown terrorism before we embark on cleaning up the rest of the world.
5,Fascinating expose of the reality of religious fringe-dwellers,"As one who is infatuated with the so-called religious extreme, ie, cults, isolated religious groups and off-shoots of the larger world religions, this book was an eye-opener.I've been a fan of every one of Krakauer's books, but this one was my favorite to date. He deftly weaves together the story of the murders with a streamlined history of the Mormon faith and how the FLDS emerged from it.His work, and particularly ""Under the Banner,"" is what compelling nonfiction is all about."
5,A captivating book,"Excellently written, captivating and interesting. A lot of what JK writes about in his book are theological remnants of early Mormon faith and some of the more grotesque outgrowths thereof that the LDS church probably wishes would simply vanish in thin air, but which keep rearing their ugly head from time to time in Utah. To understand some of the strangeness of what goes on in Utah to this day this book is a ""must read"". In contrast to Fawn McKay Brodies excellent but thick and extensive book about Joseph Smith ""No man knows my history"", this book can actually be read easily in a short period of time as its historic portions are much more condensed to the most essential. The author goes back and forth between chapters on historic events of the 19th century and chapters of more contemporary events (Lafferty brothers). The book is written so well that everyone I loaned it to reads through it in record time."
4,"Informative but a bit dry. He is a special writer, though.","There is something about his writing style that I really enjoy. The subject matter is a bit dry, but still interesting. If you haven't read anything buy Krakauer start with Into Thin Air and Into the Wild first...then this."
4,"Scary, horrifying, True Crime being lived out every day!",I was sickened by what I learned in this book.Interesting that these groups of FLDS take so much money from the government that they destest. That is tax money we pay in that is given to them to let them live that illegal and immoral lifestyle.I have seen religious fundamentalism first hand and I think there is a note of mental illness attached to it in most every case.Book was very informative. (Couldn't put it down.)
5,A great book in the spirit of Into the Wild,"I really enjoy the writing style of Jon Krakauer. I have read all three of his previous books. To me, Under the Banner of Heaven contains all of the strengths of his other non-fiction narrative book, Into the Wild, about Chris McCandless (Into Thin Air, his other narrative, is my favorite book). Like Into the Wild, Under the Banner is an exhaustively researched work, complete with first hand accounts of the places mentioned in the narrative as well as interviews with available persons who lived the story. These elements, combined with Krakauer's rich vocabulary and straight but elegant prose make Jon Krakauer my favorite author. Like Krakauer, I have always found mormons to be fascinating, but knew little about their history. To me, he said many good things about the mainstream LDS Church and their history: I found the narrative of Brigham Young leading the LDS's to Utah totally amazing. A fantastic read!"
4,Under The Banner of Heaven,"This is an excellent, suspenseful, enlightening, and ultimately shocking book. Like the author's other books, UTBOH illuminates the personalities of people living 'extreme'.Mormons, in general, are 'outraged' over UTBOH. They are quick to point out any disputable errors. However, in criticizing UTBOH, they do not and cannot deny the key episodes of the book. Like it or not, episodes of murder and slaughter and polygamy and pedophilia and kidnapping and fraud are throughout the history of the LDS church ... not just in the history of Fundamentalist Mormonism.Sadly, these episodes give all Christianity a bad reputation. This is a wonderful book, and serves as a warning to all people of faith, showing what happens when people refuse to 'let God be God'. I give it my highest recommendation."
3,If only half of it is true...,"This book is frightening. So many people hold fast to the teaching of Joseph Smith, yet he molded the faith to fit his wants and desires. He married a 14 year old girl and consummated the marriage while still married to his wife Emma. The writings of Jon Krakauer seem to be exaggerated, but a study of some of the books endorsed by the Mormon Church will attest to his truth.You will find this book bizarre, yet entertaining. If only half of it is true, you will wonder how so many people have been duped into believing this ideology.I recommend it. It is an eye-opener."
2,Difficult to read,"The book was too long, very descriptive. It kept switching back and forth in time, many many characters, Sometimes too complicated to follow. I thought I was going to enjoy this book, but I didn't even finish it ( very unusual for me)"
3,"A Lesser Work of Jon's, but good narrative nonetheless","Jon gets his facts rights. However, the narrative is slow, and the new facts become repetitive. In the light of September 11, the book can be far more powerful, if Jon asks why humans do inhumane things. The crime and the motivation that Jon describes, are not unique to Mormons, nor are they unusual with respect to Western religious history."
1,The truth is out there--just don't look here,"A book so full of errors is a disgrace and should cause the reader to wonder what else the author got wrong. Krakauer doesn't even seem to know who the president of the Mormon Church is--doesn't he have an editor or fact-checker? Every church has a few bad apples, but to implicate an entire church based on the actions of two ex-members (who were excommunicated--obviously the church recognized that they were off their rocker) is pretty sad. Following this logic, each time there is a crime, we should find out what religion the person is and then blame the church in question for their actions--ludicrous and ridiculous.Krakauer should stick to mountaineering--he doesn't know enough about religion to do the subject justice."
1,Anti-Mormon claptrap,"This book tries to do for Mormonism what the Protocols of the Elders of Zion does for Judaism, and is just as blatantly anti-Mormon as that tome is anti-Semitic. The central premise of Krakauer's book, based on antecdote and innuendo, seems to be that if you grew up in a mainstream Latter-day Saint family, you're just a couple of philisophical shifts away from becoming a wild-eyed homicidal religious maniac. Meanwhile, in the real world, millions of Latter-day Saints quietly raise productive, tolerant, law-abiding citizens, whose simple lives of goodness are ultimately the most eloquent refutation possible of Krakauer's rabid stereotyping."
1,An Author's Cheap Shot,"This is the third book by Jon Krakauer that I have read. Upon its completion I found myself questioning many of the ""facts"" the author presented in the first two books. My conclusion is that either there is much more fiction in the author's earlier writings than I would have thought or the author has exceeded his professional capabilities.I agree with many of the expletives used by others regarding this book, i.e.; captivating, appalling, provocative, engrossing, startling, horrific, intriguing, and disturbing, yet it lacks the compelling accuracy demanded by such a story.The author is a self-professed agnostic however in this reader's opinion it is unprofessional to so heavy lace one's beliefs through a book marketed as non-fiction.Greatly Disappointed!"
2,>>SNORE<<,"As an obsessive-compulsive type, I typically have a horrid time quitting a book before finishing it. IN this case, however, I had virtually no qualms about packing it in three-quarters of the way through.I expected this book to be fantastic, a riveting ""In Cold Blood""-type take on a heinous crime. Instead, it was a long (and I mean LONG) discussion of the Mormon faith.While it's true that the murderers were at one point related to the Mormons, their particular brand of ""Mormonism"" bears about as much resemblance to the faith as McDonald's does to gourmet cuisine. They may come from the same place, but they have diverged enormously along the way.I found the link between the history of Mormonism and the Laffertys' crimes to be tenuous at best, and couldn't bring myself to handle another few hours of 19th century history just to get to the end of this arduous read."
1,Unprofessional and poorly researched,"As a fan of his other novels, this book was a great disappointment to read. I have also written about the Mormons and their church while working as a journalist throughout the world, and I have researched many of the same stories. His slant and deceptive writing style were a shame to read from a professional viewpoint. I am familiar with many of the sources he used, and it is unfortunate he chose to focus on those with ""bones to pick"" with the Mormon culture, so to speak. I didn't feel he was objective at all. Agnostic yes. Objective, no. But hey, if it makes a bestseller, who cares if he's honest? Extremely disappointing coming from Krakauer."
1,The man has an agenda...,"He claims to be objective, but I (a long inactive Mormon, and able to be quite critical of the church) found an implied equation between the extremists he focused on and the larger LDS institution as a whole. I rate it P for Propaganda.Better views into LDS life and culture are available."
4,Interesting Book on LDS and FLDS beliefs.,"I am enjoying reading this book, but I can only read a little at a time. It is a huge amount to process on each page. And, nearly every page has footnotes. I believe that the descriptions are very interesting and make me understand where my LDS friends come from on certain subjects. I also believe that the purpose of this book is to inform people outside the LDS faith and not to make judgement on FLDS or LDS beliefs. I recommend this book to those who are curious about the Morman religion and those who are already in the Mormon religion. I believe that there are a great deal of Mormons out there that have never taken the time to fully understand their beliefs and where they came from (ie faith in the word of the Elders and Prophets - the LDS church discourages members to research other faiths or viewpoints). I recommend this book just as I would recommend a book about Catholicism to a Catholic or non-Catholic alike."
4,Descent from Everest to the depths of Mormon fundamentalism,"Taking off from the true story of Mormon fundamentalist brothers who murdered in the name of divine revelation, Krakauer delves into the depths of radical Mormon sects with diabolical leaders, all in the name of True Faith. He goes all the way back to Joseph Smith&#65533;s violent journey to Utah where, no surprise, he receives a message from on high that bigamy is just fine with God. Krakauer&#65533;s ability as a writer to render the story right up front and in your face with superb dialogue and scene setting makes for a compelling read. The recent kidnapping, brainwashing, and sexual abuse of Elizabeth Smart fed in a timely way into this books publication release.One thing for sure: Krakauer knows how to hold our attention."
4,Prepare to be shocked,"If you are unfamiliar with fundamentalist Mormonism, this book will take you on a journey to places that you will doubt could even exist in 21st-century America. In the style of Jon Krakauer's other writings, the book is engaging, addicting, and disturbing. Of course, the book's outrageous subject matter certainly helps that along.While the book centers on the true-crime story of the Lafferty murders, Krakauer indulges in some substantial subplots: a detailed history of the Mormon church in the 19th century, as well as an expose of fundamentalist Mormonism. Although Krakauer jumps among these three threads frequently, the book manages to hold together well.Some Mormons might object to the way Krakauer treats the mainline Mormon church's beginnings, but I think his presentation is balanced. Also, I tremendously respect Krakauer for closing his book with a short, but honest, statement of his own worldview."
5,Fascinating,"Under the Banner of Heaven caught my eye in the bookstore for two reasons: first, it was by Jon Krakauer, and second it was about the Lafferty murders and the Mormon church. Krakauer's books have been incredible and I have always been fascinated by the Mormon faith. This book is very readable, it captured my attention throughout, and it is balanced which allows the reader to really churn over the information in his head and go from there. Great read, I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys history."
5,"Well researched, compassionate and insightful","I am a big Jon Krakauer fan, and when this book came out, I thought it was odd that an adventure writer chose to take on religious subject manner. Throughout the book, I felt Mr. Krakauer demonstrated his talent for objectivity, especially considering the brutal nature of this material. The book was not only a good history lesson of the Mormon faith, but was also a revealing look at the extremes that religions can go to."
4,Good,Kept me interested. A bit og a history/text book feel of it. A good book for anyone hungry to learn along with wanting to be encourage to think about the subject and discuss it in all directions. Opened my eyes and horrified me.
5,Good insight into Mormanism,"My father requested this book and has been loaning it to everyone he can ever since. (after he listened to it, of course) Of course this is not a documentary on all Mormans, but it does give you a better idea of what can be twisted about the religion."
4,A Look at the Fundamentalists,"This book is one of the most enjoyable and fast paced history books I've ever read. It is driven by the story of two Mormon Fundamentalists who killed a young woman and her baby based on a revelation one received from God, but the real meat of the book is a discussion of Mormanism and its many break-offs. Krakauer did a staggering amount of research to learn what Mormons believe, why they believe it and how those beliefs have developed, both within the church itself and the fundamentalist sects that have branched off of it, over the last century. It is a fascinating story that is as rough and tumble as any other American tale and is just as exciting. Krakauer is an excellent reporter and has proven to be very good at telling adventure stories (which this seems to be at times), so I this is a highly entertaining read and a great book for people interested in American or reliogious history. I would highly recommend it."
4,Enlightening,This book was given to me by a guy I am dating after the subject of Mitt Romney came up. This book shed a lot of light on Mormon fundamentalists and violence. It's a good read although hard to get through the first half. The second part is a good psychological thriller.
2,Not as well researched as some reviews claim,"I read this book and found the interviews with Dan Lafferty very interesting and chilling. However, as an in-active member (no love lost there) of the LDS Church and someone with family history in the church dating back to it's origins, I know some of the details of the early church given in this book to be incorrect. I have to question how carefully researched the rest of the information has been."
4,Good with a grain of salt,"I read this book after it was recommended to me by a few non-religious friends of mine. In it, Krakauer takes an in-depth look at the Lafferty murders of 1984. All the while, he also gives you what he thinks is the history of the Mormon church. I say that because Krakauer claims to be an atheist, though he sounds more like an agnostic. Either way, the whole picture Krakauer paints is with that brush. Most of the time, the bias is somewhat subtle, but a few times it jumps out at the reader. As long as you read the book with an open mind, and take it with that grain of salt, then the book is pretty good. Just don't take what he says to be the Truth."
2,Loaded with errors,"A good read and an interesting ""story"" however the large number of factual errors casts a shadow over the book's veracity. Some of the errors are so glaring to be comical (i.e. Mark E. Peterson was never the LDS church's president). Dosn't Krakauer have a fact checker?"
3,Save your money,"This is nothing like Into The Wild or Into Thin Air. It's a disturbing look at the twisted reality and growth of Morman fundamentalism. I'm glad I read it, but it's not a keeper."
3,JON KRAKAUER AND MORMONISM,"I ALSO AM A HUGE JON KRAKAUER FAN AND WILL READ ANYTHING HE WRITES. i picked up this book in barnes and noble due to the krakauer name. i was expecting another mountain climbing book, much to my surprise, i discovered it was about mormonism. a religion i studied to become a part of during my teenage years. thank God that my parents wouldn't let me. while over all mormonism isn't a ""bad"" religion, at least not as bad as some, there were so many things i read in this book i didn't know. for instance,they believe masterbation is a sin. yet incest and molestation appear to be common. and whats up with the 13 yr old girls being married to the 50+ men. sometimes there own fathers/ stepfathers. while i do realize that there is a difference between the polygamous mormons and the mainstream LDS church, i find it rather frightening that this is the fasting growing christian religion in the united states.an informative and enjoyable read. what are you going to write about next jon?"
1,Under the BAnner of Heaven,"I have not enjoyed reading this book. I though it was going to be about the murder. I am over half way through the book and it tells the entire Moron history, which I do not have an interest in a history lesson."
5,"A Lesson To Be Learned,","Under the Banner of Heaven:A Story of Violent Faith by Jon Krakauer, is a book about many things. Very educational at least for me it was. Insightful and well-written."
2,Too violent to get through the first disc,"My daughter was thinking about converting to LDS and I had researched the religion. I am NOT LDS or Mormon. From what I have learned, this book has nothing to do with LDS, it is about the FLDS (Fundamental Latter Day Saints) and they separate themelves from the Mormons as the ""original"" faith. They believe they are above the US Constitution and the law. The FLDS are giving the Mormons a bad name, I may not believe the way they do but this is not their way either. These are the kind of books that confuse people and give the wrong impression. This book is so disturbing that I don't even want to give it away...."
2,Cell Salts,"Gives brief information on the number and names of the cell salts, and a quick reference on problems and what to use. Not as pleased as I was with Homeopathic Cell Salts Remedies."
4,Natural Healing with Cell Salts,"I have been using cell salts for years (Hyland's Mag/Phos 6X) for leg cramps, and chest pains, with excellent results.I had been looking for a complete reference book to cover other maladies for my family and this one seems to be good. I know I will refer to it often, and it is another tool to use in my quest for good health."
5,very informative,"This book is very easy to read, and very informative. Much information, and just what I needed."
5,Another great set from Lego,"Robots, Legos, and imagination, combined into one. For those fond of robots and Legos, bring your fantasy to life with this Designer set, complete with all the pieces needed to build the unique creations you desire."
3,Perfect gift for a Jackpot Gift Basket,"I made my boyfriend a gift basket that include ""It Could Happen To You"" on DVD... The gift basket was ""titled"" I'm so lucky!! I hit the jackpot the day I met you!!! =) I included Hershey's Treasures, 100 Grand candy bars, chocolate and bubble gum coins, a piggy bank, lottery tickets and this movie. My boyfriend loved how creative I got, but best of all was snuggling together on the couch, eating chocolate, and watching this movie."
3,"For those who like warm, fuzzy-feeling flicks","Being a Nicolas Cage fanatic, it was hard for me to judge the movie impartially. But overall it is a decent movie, a nice romantic comedy that ends ""happily ever after."" This is a story to watch to put someone in a good mood....it's just basically a very good movie...and it's worth watching."
2,no title,"What a disappointment! I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy. Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never. Very predictable plot from beginning to end. And Rosie Perez was truly offensive. A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying. There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other. Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language. Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene. It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way. I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners. Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler] But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together."
2,"good movie, bad language",This could have been a very good movie if the language from one of the cops could have been censored. A shame a movie with a good thought behind it couldn't have been shared with the whole family. Not suitable for children.
1,Unbearable,"My wife, my mother and I sat down to watch this and barely made it through a half hour before we all agreed to turn it off. We had expected to like it after it did so well at the box office but the characters are so weak and the plot and dialog are so predictable it was torturous. If you want a romantic comedy pick When Harry Met Sally or Shakespeare in Love. Even Sleepless in Seattle, which is essentially enjoyable fluff, is way better than this movie. I would watch Sleepless again but I couldn't even watch all of It Could Happen To You once."
4,TOTALLY AWESOME FEEL GOOD ROMANCE MOVIE,"Aaahhhhhhh love is in the air. especially when u see this movie. i loved it soooo much!!! there's something magical about it all. like love, it's all magical. go rent, buy, whatever. just see this movie. it's GOOD!"
4,none,bridget fonda and nicolus cage are wonderful in this movie. sometimes while seeing this movie you tend to foget that some part of this movie really happened in new york.
4,Romantic feel good movie,"Cage and Fonda had chemistry from the moment they first set eyes on each other. They'll keep you rooting for the good samaritans right from the beginning. Although there were some scenes that were too unbelievable, those of us who believe in romantic fate will see through it."
4,True Romance,"Very sweet movie. I loved it, and I think true Romantics will love it too. Based on a true story, it follows the adventures of a cop who wins a lottery and shares his winnings with an out-of-luck waitress. Rosie Perez did an excellent job as the Cop's overbearing and greedy wife, as did Ms. Fonda and Mr. Cage.I nearly cried at the end when the citizens of NY came through for the kind-hearted Cop and the Waitress.When you find out what happens to the Cop's wife at the end of the movie, you will laugh out loud.I couldn't get through Sleepless in Seattle, and found this movie to be much better than the usual so-called Romantic movies."
3,Blu-ray ???,"I love the movie but I was suprised by the quality when it's supposed to be a blu-ray. It was kind of grainy and not a high definition look,my Sony blu-ray player and LG tv is brand new. I don't have the problem with other dvd's, however, this is the first old movie I bought in blu-ray. Kind of disappointed, I could have just bought a regular dvd I guess. The shipping was fast and the dvd seemed to be in good condition."
4,It could happen to you,I love Nicholas Cage movies. He plays all different types of characters. I liked this movie it was a romantic type of movie.
5,Classic Movie,"I am updating my movie selections from VCR to DVD's and this was a movie that I wanted to keep. The DVD was in quality condition, received quickly, and sold for a reasonable price. What more can I ask. Thank You!"
3,"I am a big Nick Cage fan, but this just didn't do for me","Nick Cage is my favorite actor, and he played the role of a good-hearted and generous cop with the sincerity that he brings to all his roles. I had read about Bridget Fonda, who played the waitress in this film, and was happy to see her in a movie for the first time--and found her quite engaging. The plot for this movie, however, was a disappointment. There were too many coincidences to allow me to really feel fully engaged in this movie. There was also the problem that the contrast between the good characters (the cop and the waitress) and the bad (especially Rosie Perez as the cop's greedy wife) was too great. I generally need a movie to endow its characters with more complexity--especially for bad guys who are meant to be everyday people rather supernatural creatures, monsters, or comic-book villains."
2,It was a struggle to finish this one!,"Included in this book: INTRODUCTION/Lawrence Schimel: SONG OF THE CARDS/Jane Yolen (poetry); SYMBOLS ARE A PERCUSSION INSTRUMENT/Tanya Huff; THE COURT OF THE INVISIBLE/Billie Sue Mosiman; NEW BEGINNER'S LUCK/Mark A Garland; HOUSE OF CARDS/Don Webb; ARTICLES OF FAITH/Nina Kirki Hoffman; WILD HORSES/Charles de Lint; THE INTERSECTION OF ANASTASIA YEOMAN AND LIGHT/Rosemary Edghill; CHATTEL/Lucy Taylor; ELVIS LIVES/Nancy Springer; IN THE CARDS/Michelle Sagara West; SOLO IN THE SOPTLIGHT/George Alec Effinger; THE GATES OF JORIUN/Kate Elliott; TOWER OF BRASS/Teresa Edgerton; THE SIXTEENTH CARD/Susan Wade.15 stories, 1 poetry and an intro. It was a struggle to finish this book. Five stories were OK. There was only one I really liked of those five. I don't know what I expected this collection to be, but it wasn't this strange assortment. See if you can get this used, or from the library."
2,Kessinger Publishing,Please DO NOT order a version of this book by Kessinger Publishing. The reprint version they offer is of a very poor quality ( it's a poor quality photocopy pasted in a larger format ) . The book itself is a treat though.
3,Not Bad But Not For Everyone,"I read this book as a suggested further reading on a different subject. This book is pretty much a catalog of some of the author's more disturbed patients and how he treated their illnesses.The idea is that psychological issues manifest themselves as physical issues with the body, and he makes this argument by telling stories about some of his patients and how their physical issues were relived by psychological means. Obviously the names and other personal information has been changed to protect their identity.I only give this three stars because I personally didn't get much out of it, it wasn't really my cup of tea but it was an interesting read. It's a quick read, I read it in an evening."
2,Description is erroneous,"According to the description of the Ventshade, it mounts without drilling holes. This certainly is not true of the one sold for the Odyssey--the deflector comes with a couple of screws and you have to drill holes in the hood to attach the deflector to the underside of the hood."
4,Syncs with Handheld,"The absolute best feature of this software is the ability to sync with your handheld. The ability to call-up any password or account info in my handheld when I'm travelling is the exact feature I was looking for, but yet have all the info also stored on my computer at home. The reason I only gave four stars is the lack of a search function in the application - you have to scroll through all your entries to find the one you want."
4,One flaw,"Really good quality shirt, I would have no complaints, BUT, if you turn the cuffs up instead of buttoning them, the inner liner os white, NOT camo, which bites."
1,Literary hop scotch (save your money),"Mr El-Amin makes an cursory examination of a systems the requires much more than just make one or two points from what can be questionable sources and then adding his own assumptions and interpretations. Throughout the book he uses contradictary sources that usally only applies to one particular point, never attempting make any logical connection between points."
2,Not Necessary Literature,"This book is a ok book I own it however its alot of things the author doesnt know about the organization and its obvious to me as a reader of this literature he wrote. This book state some truth, but it also contains statements the author accepts as fact that are not well founded."
1,very confusing book,this book was more for opinion then fact. the interest looses you after the first chapter. go to other books for catholics. this is not a good beginner's book if you're just looking into masonry.
1,Of dangerous lies,"As one of your reviewers says, ""Muslims have their problems too""...This is a correct statement. They have more of ""their problems"", actually. It is sorry to see Western society, worthy of so much, stoop so low in the face of all its gains of the past and present, in allowing the likes of Al-Amin to say what they have to, in the name of ""free speech"" and ""political correctness"" and liberalism, and giving their outpourings a legitimate branding through this, while being lax as to the true knowledge of these people's true nature."
2,A fair book,This book does give a good account of Freemasons and their so-called secrets. There are Freemasons even in Islamic countries too. Freemasons are not Christians or Muslims. They are there own religion even if they say they are not a religion. The Masons and the Catholic church have ties even if the Catholics look as if they don't like the Masons. There are many Catholics that are Masons. The lower Masons do not know what the upper Masons are up to in world affairs. Then again most people don't know either. This book does give an even hand to both Christian and Islam. There are many Christians that understand the pagan influences within the Christian world. Whether the Holy Bible or the Koran is more pure is in the eye of the person. The Muslims have their problems with the truth too.
4,A new begining,"When this Ablum came out IN '93 a whole lot of people were into the gansta Rap state of mind.. But I recall picking up this ablum and blasting it im my college dorm room to counter all that crap I heard back then and hey lets face it even now..Many gems on this album but a 4 star rating is not in effect here because they were young then and it shows..but i fell in love with ""'93 till infinity"" and i killed all that whack ish --mentallyGet it got it..Good for you"
4,"Yo, man this CD was a tight one, For real","Yo, I thought this was a tight CD, it had all this tight gangster stuff that was straight up keepin' it real up in here.Man, this is one of those dope CD's that just bites you in da face and say's straight up, yo. Man if your a straight -up ghetto, hard-core gangsta rapper tryin' to produce some rap up in your nieghborhood like me, you should keep it real and buy this dope record.This dope CD Gives me STRAIGHT-UP strength to just throw down some dope lyrics for everybody in red bluff.I'm out, so keep it real."
5,Best West Coast Album Ever?,"This album is a must have classic. If this is not in your collection then u need to go get it. Even though it was made in the early 90's it has such a fresh feel to it while obviously keeping an old school vibe. A-Plus, Phesto, Opio, and Tajai are some of the sickest cats in the game and its very apparent in the sick flows that lace this whole entire album."
5,BACK TO BASICS,"This is from the days when you had to be good to grab a mic. Lyrical wizardry was the order of the day, if you had no skillz you stayed away from the mic. The production is as tight as the lyrics on this album both were made for each other. BUY THIS!!!!!!!!"
5,souls of mischief are the best,i think this is one of the best cds ive ever got. the sound is different and i like it
2,"should be called ""The Opposite of Innovative""","SOM has taken hip-hop back a few steps, to an era whn rap got no respect from Rolling Stone or the radio or the grammys or the NBA or MLB. Then rap moved up and it became part and parcel of popualr music. That's because it got better. Hey, I can respect the keeping of a tradition, but one must have knowledge of why that tradition dies out in the first place. the free-flow era of rap dies out because rap became the arena and progenitor of the most significant musical breakthrough of the current decade: electronic music - studio music. Music that is assembled rather than played. Souls of M misses the point that music propells rap: rap is not spoken word."
2,Dis Cd Sukzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,Dis album Sukz cause there is only one good song on it. Tha only good song on dis BAd album is 93 till infinity. The Rest of the songs suk.
5,True rap,"Hiero is the wu-tang of the west coast- the souls keep up the hiero tradition with '93 till.. If you like REAL hip hop, like Third eye vision or any other hiero this is for you. Other groups I listen to (if you like any of them '93 till infinity is for you) 'Licks, Saafir, Tribe, Gang Star, Commen Sense, Beetnuts, outkast, Fugees, and the Roots."
1,Wrong size,I had to file the connector on this charger down just to get it to fit my mini. Don't buy unless you have the time and energy to make it fit.
4,odor removal,"This product and the device that sprays it every 20-30 minutes is great. Several different scents, not strong but pleasant smelling."
5,Great Tricep Machine,This machine works great!!! I have been using it with a couple of friends and now they want to buy one. It's a simple machine that works the tricep as good as any other machine. I use olympic weight on all my exercises so I had to put on olympic weight adapters on the tricep machine and it fits in perfect with my personal gym. I'm very satisfied with this machine.
1,didn't work as expected,"I'm sorry to have to report that this product wasn't very effective on our tub. Apparantly it works for some people, just not us. I can't recommend this product based on our experience."
3,For PORCELAIN only.,"Yes, I finally saw the little word in the product description. It should have been more prominent such as part of the bullet points about the product on the headline. The product itself doesn't even state that it's for porcelain on the outside label. It's not until you start reading the instructions that it states to test to make sure the tub is porcelain.This would probably help their rating a whole lot if it were more prominent. I wonder how many used this product on their non-porcelain tub/shower and complained here that it did not work.Update 12/27/2012: I received an email the day after I sent a request for an exchange for a product that works for other surfaces. I upgraded to a three because of the prompt reply and the email stating that they will send a product and that there was no need to send the old one back. When I get the product and actually use it, I will adjust accordingly even though the review will not be for the item on this page."
5,String Curtains,These string curtains are absolutely elegant! I wanted a safe alternative to bead curtains as we have a toddler running around. They hang nicely and are very full. I later purchased another brand of string curtains which were cheaper. I couldn't imagine that there could possibly be a difference in string curtains. I was wrong! These Park B Smith curtains are much fuller and the quality is outstanding. It's worth the extra money!
2,GISELLE IS AVERAGE WHEN IT COMES TO FEMALE LATIN POP.,"Giselle does not have spark when it comes to camera or singing presence. She does not have what it takes to be a female latin sensation here in the States like her predecessors the late Selena, Jennifer Lopez and/or Gloria Estefan.Her vocals and songs come off very bland. It could be her producers because this production is poor and amateurish. Though Giselle seems like a nice lady I don't think she has what it take s to go to the top. She doesn't have the stage presence or songs to make her a strong pop star.The songs fall flat...all of them. I give her 2 stars instead of 1 because she is trying, but she needs a better producing team, a vocal coach, and a make up stylist, along with a publicist to help her get what she needs to be a hit.Otherwise Giselle is a bomb."
4,Most don't even know who Smooth is...,"This is one of my favorite albums. She sings & raps, and although she does not have the biggest octave range or is the best MC, the melodies are catchy and the lyrics are fun. This, her debut album, is much better than her 2nd self-titled release. The title-track, ""Female Mac"", ""You Are Through"", and ""Lovin' You Is Simple"" are my favorites. Smooth is of the best little-known recording artists of the 1990s."
4,Straight Up Female Mac,"Smooth is the female from back in the days who got back at all those male mc's who steadily tryed to diss women. Most people who were not from the West Coast and even some from the West slept on Smooth.She had the same producer as Immature, Marcus Houston, B2K and Omarion.Her rhymes were cool, her vocal were smooth, catchy beats too.I have all her cd's, the first one was the best and put it like this, my husband distroyed it, because some of her lyrics made him feel insecure.My favorites were You Been Played and Dog You.If you're a hard core hip hopper, she's not for you, but if you just like to kick back and trip, check her out, you won't be disappointed."
4,Fair headphones for a fair price,"Over-all these are great headphones. The low range is surprisingly strong. The fit is great, even for a fat-head like me. The only thing lacking is the upper range which seems really tinny, & sometimes distorts. This seems to correlate with other reviews."
3,Works well but has a common control module problem,"Had this unit for a little less than 2 years. Used occasionally. It cleans the dishes well and is not very noisy.Two weeks ago the dishwasher stopped working. It does nothing except flashing the washing/drying/clean lights. Called Frigidaire to troubleshoot but they did not solve the problem. Called an authorized technician and was told the touch pad is not working, which was seen on the same model before. In fact, I did a search online and saw quite a few people having the same problem. A couple of them mentioned it happened within 2 years of the purchase date. If you want to buy this item, consider an extended warranty and keep in mind the following costs:Diagnostic costs: $80Labor: $70Part: $100 (Frigidaire is willing to cover for the part if I go through the authorized technician, but I opted to buy the part from the Internet and save on both part and labor)"
4,It was cool,Even tho im a bigger fan of Master P and Mystikal. This was a tight album (I think he went overboard with the Kevin Miller skit who is Master P's real younger brother who got killed in a drug deal gone wrong)Overall this is a good Down South Album Much Love to TROY
5,Soundtrack to my life,"Pastor Troy proved he had potential to run the underground rap scene and be the first one to make meaningful music and get rich at the same time. This cd was honestly the soundtrack to what I was dealin with. ""For Survival"" and ""Eternal Yard Dash"" tell the truth about how life really is.He has turned away from what he does best with Universal Soldier and By any means cd, but he should do another we ready type cd."
5,TrOy Iz 2 TrEaL!!!!!!!,"Troy holdin it down, this album to me is one of the best he has ever done! all of the song on here sound like real [stuff] dat be goin on in life!! u can listen to da cd and think of [stuff] dat happened to u! keep do ya thang troy! DSGB FOREVER!"
3,Pastor troy vs Master P,"My step brother had got a Pastor Troy cd from Ga. I heard it, its crump. But I dont know if P is going to take it lightly."
1,The album was wack.,Pastor Troy shouldn't be dissing Master P because he will never have the money that he has. Master P is the greatest rapper of all times ya heard.
2,what you claiming?,i am from augusta and so was pastor troy till he got signed by universal. he was repping us hard then all of a sudden it was all about the ATL. doesn't matter though cause he's garbage.
5,pure skills representing them goriga boys,this is so tight i thought something like this wasn't coming out but i was wrong. pastor troy done done it now he shouldn't came out with this because their's no on e out right now that can touch pastor troy and his click. from 1to12 yo head knocked theirs not a dull song on this album. from we ready to the last one it just keeps banging out phat beats with explosive lyrics. if you aint got this go get it cuz its all that.
3,No Mo Play in GA,"iight, i'm gonna be honest. no mo play in GA is the tightest beat i've ever heard in my life. you can't listen to it without gettin rowdy. that song by itself is worth at least 2.5 stars. but the rest of the album is iight at best. the beats are ok, troy's words are deep, but every song has the same sing song chant for a chorus that gets mad boring. but no mo play in Ga makes this album worth buyin."
5,99 Ways to Get Revenge and Earn Respect,Troy ain't hatin on nobody if he was he would flo like P aight(which P can't) I really love this CD cause he has a message in every cut especially No Mo Play in G.A. He has beats to ride to and flo's to listen to. So get crunk but don't forget to listen to his rhymes aight. But first ya gotta get the thang.Oh yeah listen for the way he converts Religious terminology into tight flos.
5,Pastor Troy is Da Bomb,"My name is Tony Higgins and I'm from a neighborhood called Green Acres(GA)in Dadeville, Al. We listen to Pastor Troy and like he said ain't no mo' playin' in GA. If ya'll ain't heard that new album, then you need to be gettin' ready to buy it cause WE READY!"
1,Time to Move On,"I have used Turbo Tax for many years. To say that this version is a disappointment is an understatement. Let's not mince words, this product is garbage. Run, do not walk, away from it. It deserves zero stars.Bug ridden, terrible interface, no support. It is March 10 and a bug they (finally) acknowledged in February is still not fixed and apparently never will be. Nothing important, just the program not applying deductions to your return raising your tax payment. You know, minor stuff. The interface? Don't get me stated. Horrible. Support? India, of course. Because they are experts in US tax law.It is time to move on to another product. Turbo Tax is now relegated to the status of being a formally good product."
5,Happy Mom!,"To Mary Everywoman, I came here to write a review about Happy Housewives, which I got for my 30th birthday and I loved, but then I read the other reviews and saw what you wrote. You sound very immature. Why would you write that someone else's book 'stinks?' I take offense to that because I loved it. Do you think that I am stupid? How about all the other happy housewives in America? Are you saying we are all stupid? And for K. Pieroni, if you were'so smart' you would know that Happy Housewives is a fun book and not Shakespeare. You both need to read page 160 where Shine writes, 'Don't be a... well it rhymes with witch.'As for me, I am a new mommy who quit her job, traded in the suburban for a used van, is now cutting coupons, but loving my life at home with my baby. Darla, I can't wait for the next book."
1,Not quite sure about this bigotted attitude,"Shine seems to criticize other women who don't agree with her. That is Bigotry any way you look at it. Very disappointed that ""Sisters"" of all races and stations in life cannot love, respect and support one another. I gave the book to goodwill, maybe someone else will benefit--"
2,Not as good as I was expecting,I really wanted to love this book but the writing was horrible. I am surprised the editor let this book slip through the cracks. I thought the premise was good but wish the writing was a bit more professional.
2,For the More Affluent Only...,"While I commend Darla on her decision to stay at home, her targeted reading audience is highly limited. Cutting costs means doing without the nanny, housecleaner, and cooking meals using organics. When the author initially stopped working, it meant days at the gym or the salon. Her discussions and examples are limited to those who have chosen to give up a well paid career to stay at home. Her ""bargain"" store examples for cutting costs in clothes is way above the Walmart budget or second hand options for many American families choosing to live on one income.My suggestion: Save your money on this one unless you are in her income bracket. Currently, there are many good books written by women who truly understand what it means to raise a family on one income. It can be done!"
3,"Upper class, spoiled, shallow housewives","Funny book! I agreed with the foundation of the book, staying home with the children you brought into this world is the most important job any woman could ever have. The motives she has for having sex with your husband tend to be quite warped and shallow.She is in a different society level than most stay at home mom's I know and talks about doing things only those in that society can do.What did I learn from reading this book:Wear tight clothes, whether or not you look or feel good in them. Have sex with your husband to get him to buy you expensive things. Spend all of your money on the latest in style things in order to get into the shallow mom of the month club at the local park.Disappointing book for sure!CAN I GET A BOOK DEAL ON ""HOW TO AVOID BECOMING A SHALLOW PERSON""?"
2,"okay, but not for the average",I thought the book was funny and laughed out loud reading it to my husband. But..... I am a not so upperclass work at home mother of three. I need help with reality and the fact I will never be financially rich like her. I was hoping this book would be more open to everyone but I definately think she wrote it for a certain group.
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!,"Do you love to hear spoiled women talk about how hard they have it with thier maids, nannies and how you should dress like them, eat like them, and reform your style of thinking to be exactly like them...THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU! Super annoying Darla Shine spends 90% of the book telling us how fab she is!!! She tells you how other people repulse her because of the way they shop, eat, act, and dress then goes on to give such handy tips as you can wear sweat pants as long as they are tight?!? She also seems to have some pent up agression towards the television show, desperate housewives, taking the title as a personal insult. Darla is most definitly desperate but a housewife...no not really... SAVE YOUR MONEY and call the meanest most shallow woman you know instead."
5,Wish I had this book years ago!,"I have been a stay at home mom for almost 9 years. This book would have been very helpful to me when I first started staying at home.Reading HAPPY HOUSEWIVES is like sitting in your kitchen and talking to your best friend over coffee. She come across as a friend, another mom, who has made the same decision I did, who has the same problems I do.I read the book over two days and have already put a lot of her advise to use.THANK YOU for writing this book!!!!!"
2,Anyone could have written this,"I was really disappointed that I bought this book. Anyone could have written this. Sure, it has some great points, but come on, she's not exactly qualified. I agree with another reader that she is very shallow. Complaining about women who weigh over 118 lbs. isn't cool when the average woman in America is a size 14. Some of the advice was good and made sense, but to me, the writer seems to be a bit self-centered and not aware of the world around her."
4,Great for moms with school age kids!,"I'll start by saying I love this book and the concepts and routines she shares. I put many of the items in use and it has worked great. The only issue I've had is that she wrote it after her children started school, so the free time she has to get all the housework and cooking done is while her kids are at school. I have a 1 and 3 year old, finding the time to stick to a cleaning schedule and having dinner and myself put together for my husband at night is a bit of a challenge right now. I'm definately holding on to it and rereading in another year or so!"
1,"Shallow, redundant, vulgar, and ignorant","Other reviewers have done an excellent job describing almost everything I hated about this book. The thing that finally made me toss the book aside, though, was a little gem that simultaneously destroyed her credibility and cast serious doubt on the credibility of Susan Powter (although I will give her the benefit of the doubt until and unless I actually read Powter's book and confirm): ""A few years ago she wrote a new book, *The Politics of Stupid*.... She taught me how to eat real food, not a bunch of processed junk. She gives oatmeal as one example. She says everyone thinks oatmeal is a healthy food, but did you ever hear of an oat tree?"" (p. 44) What the.... Seriously? Where does she think oats *do* come from, a lab? Anyone that ignorant should not be giving advice on healty eating habits. Just my opinion.So disappointed with this book."
1,Give. Me. A .Freakin. Break.,If you purchase this book you will be seriously throwing your money out the window.Darla wrote this book for one simple reason....validation. Her husband is NEVER home and has a very high powered career. So Darla came up with this little diddy about how important she is and how vital she is to the survival of her household. Yeah Right. Here are some hot tips for those of you who stay at home:1)Buy tight tee shirts2)Clean your toilet3)Have sex with your husbandSee what I mean-rocket science at its best!!I am a stay at home Mom or SAHM as it has now been coined. I also run a business from my home. I spend money on clothes and makeup. I work out 4 days a week. These are really not things that I needed to spend $25.00 on to learn.Save your money and do whatever it is that makes YOU happy and whatever works in YOUR household under your circumstances.
5,Happy Housewives,"I Love this book! It is soooo refreshing. Finally someone puts the brakes on desperate housewives. You can be a housewife raising your children and NOT be desperate. This is a great read. She's witty and she really shares herself with the reader. I haven't been able to put it down because it is so good. She talks about everything very candidly.From being a mom, relationship with your husband, keeping your girlfriends, taking care of yourself and even recipes. She is a tell it like it is person. The reason I bought the book was because I liked the cover.LOL! I have not been disappointed. When you finish this book you'll feel like you are one of Darla's best friends."
4,"Not for the die-hard feminists, but not a bad read, either.","I'll be honest; when I originally picked up this book, I was very apprehensive. The premise *sounds* good - helping housewives to find happiness with their lives, but what I was afraid of was that it was just going to turn into one of those ""the man is the head of the household; long live testosterone!"" books that seem so prevelant these days.Happily, Darla Shine seems fiesty, frank, and full of good ideas. Now, I won't kid you - she is quite vocal about her faith in god, the belief that women should be cute and slim, and feels that feminists are pretty much on the wrong track. I didn't find any of this overpowering, however; it's more like the occasional rant, that I would just skim over. In the end though, I think she makes some good points, and is definitely on the right track, even if her personal philosophies don't *quite* jibe with my own."
5,"I'm a GIRL, I'm a MOTHER","GREAT book! Hits the nail on the head. Too bad the other ""women"" are so uptight that all they can do with their day is watch to see if this book gets a negative review. Maybe if they were happy housewives, they would also have a happy s*ex life! ; )Personally, IMHO this book is really cool, and needed. Who is Darla? She's another person with something positive to say. Unlike some other uptight ""women"" who just have something negative to say. I love being called a GIRL! I love being YOUNG as I grow older gracefully, and happily! Thanks to Darla for a great book!"
1,She doesn't sound so happy to me...,"Shine's book is riddled with judgmental, egocentric opinions that she declares as fact without exception. It must be easy to be a housewife when your husband is making 6 figures a year and you have the financial freedom to basically do anything you want. She totally eliminates any minority or overweight audience in favor of her perfect Stepford Wives perspective. Sorry not everyone has fancy makeup and a gym membership Darla. We don't all look like you. But please don't roll a shopping cart at me because of it."
1,Barely Readable,"I had high hopes for this book as it looked like it was right down my alley (I'm a happy stay-at-home mom), but I found myself annoyed more and more while reading it. All she seems to do is complain about other moms who complain and it comes off hypocritical, rude and unprofessional - not something I would expect from a published work but more from an online blog. Almost every chapter starts with something like, ""I can't believe moms today do this"" or ""I am shocked at how many moms do that"". Accept it, Darla, moms are imperfect. Her book comes off more like an angry rant rather than a helpful book. She is also a very poor writer with weak organization. I would not recommend this book."
4,Worth the Money!,"Loved this book, the only thing that would have made it better was to have photos or illustrations. For a book that isn't ""conservative"" or especially ""religious"", most of her beliefs lean very far that way."
5,Attitude is everything,"I highly recommend this book. Darla is not saying that life as a housewife is always easy. Although some might say that she is not the one to talk since her life doesn't seem to be too hard, it is important to understand her point beyond her personal life. The author's main point is that although our lives as housewives are generally speaking easier than decades ago, we complain now more than ever and we see ourselves as desperate housewives. This book has helped me to put my life and problems in perspective and to love what I do (being a housewife) without losing my own self in the process. This book offers easy to follow tips to still look ""hot"", feel good about yourself, feel good about your house, your relationship with girlfriends, etc. I also love her direct, no nonsense approach, like when she says ""snap out of it!"" because I do think we need someone to tell us that from time to time."
5,Love it!,"This book has really good advice for the housewife, whether you're taking care of kids or an aging parent (like me). Although the book isn't written that way, I use her advice for creating a happy home and dealing with children and apply it to my life. Thanks, Darla!"
1,Not impressed,"I have never written a review for a book in my life, but three chapters in and I feel compelled to say something. I am also the authors target audience. I'm a married stay at home mom, my husband and I are wealthy, I am pretty, stay in shape, cook my family healthy meals and keep my house spotless. That being said, I really am quite turned off by this book. It's basically just about the author bragging about how perfect she thinks she is, and I find her to be quite arrogant. I live in the same way that she does, but I would never go on and on bragging about myself as she does. It's really quite discusting. It's as if she thinks everyone should aspire to be just like her. I find her constant praising of herself to be quite a turnoff, and will not continue reading. It's a shame, because I'm always looking for fun books to read to entertain myself with, but this will not be one of them."
2,she sounds kind of like a stuck up know it all,Even though the author annoys me I kind liked the book. She is really just saying common sense but her way of writing kind of gives the impression that she thinks she is the perfect wife. It was ok
2,What Planet Do We Live On and In What Era?,"Disappointing. This is a shallow book by someone who appears to be a smug narcissist. ""I am thin. I look good,"" she says in the beginning of the book. But what about her qualifications as a writer and ""expert"" on the subject? For an unusually intelligent exploration of keeping house, read Cheryl Mendelsohn's ""Home Comforts."" And leave the psychology to psychologists. All this author seems to know about marriage is how to manipulate men with sex. She thinks men -- and life -- are so simple that a woman merely has to do ""the nasty,"" as the author so eloquently writes, with her husband and she will get anything she wants. I just hope she has no daughters. What a sad lesson to pass on."
5,I loved this book,"I have written 3 reviews for this book and hopefully this one will go. I enjoyed the book, I have told everyone about it, and I think it is applicable whether you work or not. You all have to do it all anyway. It is a motivational book, which I rarely like to read, but it got me motivated.Darla admits all of her faults in the book, so why get down on her so much??? No one is perfect. She just shared her ideas and life with us. Be thankful, not ferocious."
5,Darla Shine is the new leader of the Mommy Movement!!!,"Wow! I can't believe all the controversy this book has caused! There are actually women out there vowing to destroy a message that is empowering women to feel good about loving their husbands, raising their children and creating a home environment that is clean and organized? Darla Shine helped me realized it's okay if I leave my job for a while to raise my baby. What is the big deal about choosing this? She gave me the kick in the butt I needed. This book is a funny book and Darla writes it like she is your best friend. Get a grip girls and lighten up. These feminists need to get a funny bone (Step 9: Lighten Up, or Step 1: Stop Whining)- or take Darla's advice in Step 4 about loving on your husband."
3,Is an album that was great but is dated now still good?,"When 12 Play first came out it was an absolute classic. However, I haven't listen to it for a long time and was surprised at how dated it is. Homie Lover Friend, Bump N Grind and Your Body's Callin' are the best cuts. Homie Lover Friend really connects with me because that is what I am looking for.Maybe one day I'll find her."
5,Kelly at his best.,"This is R. Kelly first solo album and probably his greatest. This album exudes sexiness, great album for the love birds."
4,Must have for any R&B Fan,"12 Play is Kelly's debut album, which he wrote and arranged mostly himself, which, considering the depth and scope of this album is amazing. The grooves work, the songs are sexy as hell, and they will keep you're head bobbing. One of his best efforts to date, and a must have for anyone who enjoys smooth R&B."
3,"Good album, overdoes it on the bump and grind stuff","R. Kelly's 12 Play album still holds up over a decade later. Didn't like it at first because it overdoes it on the bump and grind songs and sexy themes. It's steamy on a number of songs, especially Sex Me, It Seems That You're Ready, Your Body's Callin', the popular Bump and Grind and others. But one of my favorites is not like that. It's Sadie, R's remake of the Spinners' '70s classic, and I can't help but cry when I hear it, because he really sings it with soul. After his album came out, there were floods of R&B artists riding on the steamy themes of it in late-93 and early '94. But when the smoke cleared,this album still holds up. This set the tone for his producing of later hits with his one-man band signature sound for people like Aaliyah, Changing Faces and others. Otherwise, this album would be best heard when making love in the bedroom at 1:44 am in the morning."
3,"Good Album, but not his best. I GIVE HIM 3 1/2 STARS !...","Like no other artist R.Kelly keeps getting better from his debut album with Public Announcement to his TP-2.COM BLAZING ALBUM. In this one he gets his first chance to do a solo album, and he does it very well. He Produced, wrote, arranged 11 of the 12 songs, including to this, that he performed practically every instrument on the album. My favorites songs are: YOUR BODY`S CALLING, BUMP AND GRIND, HOMIE LOVER FRIEND,SEEMS LIKE YOU READY,SEX ME I,II, AND THE TWELVE PLAY TRACK. FOR ME IF YOU ASK ME IS A GOOD CD BUT NOT HIS GREAT BECAUSE THE FACT THAT ARE 3 OR 4 FILLER SONGS.MY PERSONAL R.KELLY`S ALBUM IS TP-2.COM (12 PLAY TWO ) BECAUSE IS VERY,VERY SENSUAL AND SOULFUL, AND ALSO BECAUSE IS THE BEST R&B ALBUM EVER MADE UNTIL NOW. BUT BUY THIS ONE, THE SONGS THAT I MENTION ARE NOW CLASSIC GEMS, TRUST ME......!"
5,12 Play,"12 Play is the debut album from R. Kelly. This album is great if you love R&B; and sexual themes.""Your Body's Callin"", ""Bump N' Grind"", ""Homie Lover Friend"", ""Summer Bunnies"", ""12 Play"" and ""Sadie"" are my favorite songs. The rest of the album is good too.R. Kelly has a very strong voice and he produces, writes and arranges all of his music which makes him a very versatile artist.If your just getting into R. Kelly, I recommend these:Chocolate FactoryTP-2.comR.The R In R&B; Collection, Vol. 1R. KellyHappy People/U Saved Meand Robert's new album, TP-3 Reloaded is real good. Songs on that album that I recommend listening to are: ""Playa's Only"", all of the ""Trapped In The Closet"" chapters, ""Remote Control"", ""Sex Weed"" and ""Sex In The Kitchen""."
4,First and still best album from this prolific but controversial musician,"R. Kelly has always been a great producer and songwriter and at least a plausible if not extraordinary singer. Though numerous legal woes have hampered his success over the past several years, he nonetheless got off to a really great start with his first album, which has a plethora of sexual undertones but still manages to sound more stylish than trashy. Contains the #1 hit ""Bump 'N Grind"" and the urban radio favorites ""Your Body's Callin'"" and ""It Seems Like You're Ready"". There is also a brilliant remix of ""Bump 'N Grind"" on the single for that song, entitled the ""Definition Of A Hotti Remix"". This was played a lot on my local radio station, and for those of you who haven't heard it, I strongly recommend. It is more blissful and sensual than the original in my opinion."
4,Ohh Kelly!!,"I am a straight up R. Kelly fan. He is superior. He creates smooth ballads and lyrics that makes you wanna sex your mate. My favorites are ""It seems like your ready"", ""For you"", and ""Sadie"". I love Sadie because I can relate to losing a loved one, like my grandmother.This album is a must buy."
3,his first solo album,i would say that i like 40% of this album. to me that's not enough. but i would purchase it b/c the 3-4 i like on there is worth the purchase
2,If I Would know I Bought Singles ..Not the CD !,"Don`t get me wrong I love R.Kelly`s music, but these album is a classic,FOR MOST OF YOU, because of the ONLY TWO GREAT SONGS ON THE WHOLE ALBUM: ""Your Body Calling"" and ""Bump and Grind"" the rest is week funky music. For Me is NOT A CLASSIC ALBUM... BUT THAT 2 SONGS ARE JUST THAT. I Rated 2 1/2 STARS.I recomend to everyone to get from R.Kelly, His Real Classic Albums(In Order): TP-2.Com (The Best of ALL R&B; Albums),His Self Title ""R.Kelly"" and his Brand New Album ""Chocolate Factory"". And then ""R"", ""This One"" and his ""Born In to the 90`s"" Debut Album."
4,Great Book; breath-taking; Lee really help you understand.,"Great Book; the best I have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone. I had to read it for a school book and i didn't really want to read it, but once I started i couldn't put it down."
4,A little upset...,"I bought this playboard thinking that it would fit the Melissa & Doug table that we currently have. Unfortunately, it does not. The playboard is actually just a little bit too big for the table, so it doesn't fit properly. But the playboard is very sturdy and durable. I got it on sale, so I'm thinking that my husband might have to do some work on it so we can fit it."
3,Blister Pak Booo!,I used the product before. It came in a bottle. This time in tiny blister pa; very difficult to open with arthritic hands. The product information did not include this information
1,NOT generic acetaminophen.,"When you search for generic acetaminophen, this product comes up in the results. Unfortunately, I relied on the search to return relevant products. When you are allergic to aspirin, and cannot take it, it is not a viable alternative to acetaminoophen. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT GENERIC ACETAMINOPHEN. It costs more to return the product than it cost to buy it and ship it. Therefore, you are out of luck if you wanted generic acetaminophen and have to reorder. Shame on Amazon for including other drugs when searching for a specific drug."
1,Desert Tan Sand GI 100% Cotton Army ACU T-Shirt 8570 Size XL,I was very disappointed with the quality of these shirts. I ordered them for my son serving in Afghanistan. I decided to go ahead and wash them so I could get them shipped quickly with other items he needs right now. I will have to search for a better quality shirt.
1,"Small, and doesn't lock!","The subject of my review really says it all...the box, though interesting looking, doesn't lock and is exceptionally small. Furthermore, if it did lock, a strong judo chop could thwart the duty of the tiny, skeleton key lock. I'll protect my watches in something a bit more substantial, (besides just insurance), and would advise you to do the same if it's more than costume jewelry you're hoping to protect.Kindly,JT"
3,Ok,This might be better for men's watches.......I have smaller wrists and my watches do not close around the padded inserts.
1,Terrible Product,The keys don't work.. Its the biggest Waste of Money!!! I'd never recommend this item......... It's cheap for a reason!
3,pretty good,"this is a pretty good vampire flick. It doesn't really explainstuff but still good, it could of been a little longer so it would have time to explain and be a better movie."
1,The Other Reviews Were Written By The Blind,"Special Effects are bad, acting is worse and the writing comical. I found this movie grouped with other vampire films of the decade and really the others are better. The story is predictable. Good nice vampire verses bad nasty vampire. The worst is that they have a poorly executed sword fight at the end.If you want a good B vampire film watch ""From Dusk Till Dawn""."
4,good,this story is about two vampire brothers who come together after one(Radu) of the kills their father. And there are three friends from america who come to study the vampire folklore of the area. which they where looking for a fun time and excitment but found that they were stuke in the middle of the two brothers.
3,Not Especially Original But Fun!,"This is the beginning of a series that you have to watch even though its full of every worn out story line and ridiculous dialog. There is nonetheless an appeal that compels you to go back and pick up every addition in the series. The premise is the good vampire Stefan battles his evil half brother Radu over the fate of the woman they both fell in love with. I think one of the biggest mistakes this series made was bumping off Stefan. He was a good contrast to Radu, whose character is fond of spouting worn out phrases like ""my fledgling"" to the point of being almost cartoon-like. Subspecies is a fun series in a comic-book vampire kind of way. I'd recommend it to diehard fans only."
4,Classic vampires from the land of vampires,"This is a series of movies I'd like to see re-released... possibly in a DVD set. It's certainly a breath of fresh air from the American obsession with ""cute"" vampires. I think the entire series does an excellent job of portraying the Romanian legends of vampires that were twisted into the current Hollywood concept. I'd buy it over ""Fright Night"" any day of the week."
4,subspecies . . . THE NIGHT HAS FANGS.,"Deep within the heart of Transylvania, a dark power from the past has resurfaced, and three beautiful young research students are caught in the midst of a supernatural battle for control of the vampire kingdom. Blood is the tie that binds the good Stefan (MICHAEL WATSON) and the evil Radu (ANDERS HOVE), vampire brothers reunited by the death of their father, King Vlad (ANGUS SCRIMM). Radu creates an army of hellish creatures of the night--subspecies--to help him in his wicked quest. Stefan has love on his side as Michelle (LAURA TATE), one of the students, joins him in the desperate fight to save the kingdom from the terrifying rule of Radu."
4,One of the best!,A classic vampire movie that has been underrated by many. A movie about two brothers who fight over the bloodstone that would give the owner the ability to not have to kill to stay alive. As the conflict between brothers gains momentum the budding of a love story between one of the brother's and a mortal woman named Michelle begins to blossom she is turned into a vampire by the end of the movie and goes into the end of the 1st part of a 4 movie story as his lover.
2,Recommended for absolute beginners. Not for smarter people.,"This book is a fairly good intro to Assembler language on MVS. Programmers who have not got a clue about what Assembler is, will benefit from it. However, you'll outgrow this book in two weeks. Character and number representation is dealt in detail. But important concepts like base register, addressability and macro language are only mentioned here and there without any real treatment. This indeed leaves a big gap in the book. Do buy this book if you are really new in the world of Assembler. Don't buy this book if you are planning to become a systems programmer one day."
4,Good book for students and self study,"This book is excellent for students, or for someone like me who had to get into mainframe assembler in a hurry. I was able to read the book in about 4 hours, and doing the examples in the book helped lock the concepts into my mind.I would like to see a section with more information on the mainframe and additional material on more advanced subjects. Some preparation on the kinds of assembler errors to expect from the mainframe would be nice too."
1,brush-t,"What was pictured was not what was sent. Product was a cheap imitation of what I thought I was buying , which was a product that I had purchased locally and was happy with. Bristles were so flimsy that they would not hold up the ball. First time I was disapointed and felt misled about an Amazon transaction."
4,Jon's review,this is a good product and helps me play better golf. I just wish I could find these locally so I don't have to pay shipping to buy them. But they do work well.
5,Classic video by the master,"The first volume in the six volume set. Being from Inosanto, it's a great set and one you can watch over and over, and you'll always learn something new. This volume covers the basics, stances, strikes, knife and stick principles, some of the history, and shows Danny's of course impeccable technique. The Lacosta stick grappling techniques in the fifth or sixth video (can't recall which at this point) are worth the whole price of the set by themselves, not to mention all the other material. The volumes four and five are especially strong on the espada y daga (sword and knife), one of my favorite subjects. A must for any FMA practitioner."
1,"Worthless, don't waste your money","I was hopeful after reading other reviews that maybe this product would save me from having to pay for a professional test. I was sorely disappointed. I suspected our water had higher levels of iron (or something) than it should because of the yellow/brown stains it was leaving on the tub. I followed directions to a T and this test said everything was fine with our water. Since I knew something had to be off, I went ahead and paid for a professional test and sure enough we had high levels of Iron and Manganese. I do NOT recommend getting this kit."
5,Easy to use,"The directions on this kit were very easy to follow and understand. This set of testing took mere minutes (with the exception of the bacteria test - 48hrs) to get results. We are wanting to buy a water filter, and as such wanted to test the water to figure out which would be best for our use. We had good results, all within the exceptable limits. However, if they had appeared off, we would have opted for the more expensive lab testing."
4,Test kit does the job,"This Watersafe test kit arrived quickly. It tested the things we were interested in plus some others. The instructions were explicit and easy to follow, and the tests themselves worked quickly and were easy to interpret. Our only reservation was that there is no independent way to verify that the tests were accurate, but that would be true of any similar product."
2,Overpriced!,Test was adequate but kit only contained one test strip. I was expecting to be able to do more than one test for that price.
1,Dont bother!!,This test kit was useless! It did not contain directions. There were no graduated color charts showing degrees of chemical presence nor were there any numerical values for anything. The Lead and Pesticide strips came in a vile - what was one to do with them and how to interpret any results? Again No Documentation at all - completely useless!! I would rate this a Zero star if possible.
3,very useful,I needed a quick and easy test kit just to ease my mind abut the well water where I moved. Had it shown any problems I would have had the water tested further at a lab. It suited my needs for an informal general test for major issues.
1,Do not buy this.,"The product was incomplete, seemed to have been opened, even though I bought it ""new"". I was so frustrated that I threw the whole thing out and called the Culligan man to help me with my water problems."
5,Easy to us.,"We bought this to help determine if there was anything in our well water to be concerned with (fortunately, our water was good). This test was very easy to use. Just follow the directions and read the results!"
3,Water Test,This is ok for the money but the nitrate test was not clear. The color difference on the test strip was so slight that I could not determine a valid number. I really liked the Bacteria test.
4,"Seems To Work, But Who Knows?","I have used this test twice now for the well water at my place. It is exactly the same as the First Alert test kit selling for $12.88 - contents, instructions, everything - with the addition of tests for Copper and Iron. Instructions are easy to follow, and results are pretty clear. Some colors are hard to match up with the charts, but it gives a pretty good indication if you have a problem. I hope, anyway - without a professional test to comapre with, I really have no way to be sure."
1,No instructions included,I received the test kit Friday and no instructions where included just the testing supplies. i went online to find the instructions and i can only find drinking water not well water instructions.
2,For what it's worth,It works well to test water but it's a one time use and for the price it doesn't feel worth it. Go to the nearest Wally World or nearest Mega store to get a tester.
5,"Good kit, easy to use","The instructions were clear. The tests were quick, except for one which took 24 hours, with unambiguous results. It covered a wide spectrum of tests. I was very happy with this product."
5,Works as expected!,"I purchased the Watersafe kit from amazon and the pro-lab Water Quality Test Kit from home depot. I'm going to be buying a water softener soon, and I have to know how hard my water is before I buy one. I tried the pro-lab one first, and the first test said my water was soft (zero ppm). OK, I know it's not soft. The second test put my numbers around 75 ppm. I was still a little leery about the results since I know for a fact that we have hard water.I then did the watersafe test and found the hardness to test around 450ppm's. This is a huge difference in the watersafe kit. The other results seemed more of what I would have expected as well.I've never had my water tested by a lab, but I believe that the watersafe kit is a better choice than others that are out there."
4,"Easy to use...but,","The reason it was easy to use was because I read user reviews here on Amazon. If not I would have had a problem getting an accurate read. I was happy to know I have clean well water and as I already knew it is hard. But the good news about that is that calcium is one of the ""ingredients"" in a drink! yey"
3,I'll likely try something else,"Everything in the kit was there. The test methods seemed like they could be more efficient. The lead test came back as invalid, so to test for lead, I would have to purchase a new kit. I will probably try someone else's product next time I test well water."
1,Missing some tests,"This test kit came missing two tests. The packaging for the copper test strip was included, but it was empty (there was no test strip inside). It was also missing the strip (and packaging) for the pH/hardness/chlorine test. The plastic box that contains all of the contents can be opened and closed by anyone (it is not secured shut in any way)."
4,Water test Kit,I bought this water test kit because we have been having terrible problems with our water. It seemed to tell us everything we wanted to know.
4,Perfect knife for my needs...,"I considered buying an automatic conversion of this knife, in order to make it easier to open one handed, however, when I received the manual knife and tried it, I gave up on the notion of the auto model. It opens so easily with one hand that there is no need for anything to make it any easier to open with one hand.My only negative comment is that I would have preferred the knife without the belt clip attached. I have no intention of ever clipping it to anything. The clip doesn't seem to interfere with its use, so I guess no real harm having it I suppose.I couldn't decide between the SW3001 Serrated edge and the SW2001 Non-Serrated edge, so I bought one of each and now that I have then both, I still can't decide which to carry and which to leave at home."
3,A good album but 8 SONGS????,"HI-Five's Faithful was very good. But 8 songs? I thought they could have done more. This album is really good, and they sound good on quieter numbers like As One. The funky songs like I'm In Need and What Can I Say To You are just as strong here. Unconditional Love and Faithful are some of their best ballads and stand out more on this album. Hi-Five made a good follow up."
2,bad copy,"Wish the seller had included their disclaimer in their product description: ""this book may have occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. ..."" So far, I've noticed that pages iv-vi of the preface are missing, and there are scribbles (markings) throughout the book. I'm very disappointed, in fact am ordering a volume from another publisher."
2,Not recommended for beginners,"I'm a begginer and I thought it would be easy to follow the steps shown in the book, but unfortunatly it wasn't. the figures in the book aren't that good, so as the illustration .Besides it doesn't provide any exercise."
1,Useless Useless Useless,"I knew no Korean, but was going to travel there, so I borrowed this item from the library (fortunately I didn't waste my money to buy it!) to try to learn a bit of Korean. I didn't learn a thing.The lesson goes way to fast for a beginner. They jump right in with full sentences spoken at near-full speed. There is little effort made to build on previous vocabulary, no grammar, no breaking down sentences into pieces, no review, just one sentence of random (to me) sounds after another.I can't believe anyone can learn a language with this CD. Maybe, just maybe, if one listens to it 25-50 times, but there has got to be faster ways.The phrases themselves are OK, not great. They cover the basics, but some are a bit suspect. ""I'd like to buy a roll of film"" can probably go.This might be useful to someone with 1-2 semesters of Korean, to learn some good phrases. But everyone else, avoid."
4,Great Fan if you want to move a lot of air,"This is a great fan for moving a lot of air. It is loud.I would have rated it a 5 but the plastic molded switch whichallows you to select off, 1, 2, or 3 broke apart on me. It stillworks. Just half of the plastic knob is gone.This knob falling apart did not stop me from buying another one."
5,Awesome wind machine ...,"Simply put, these are some of the best and most durable fans that are on the market. As owner of two of them, the wind never stops blowing ;-)"
4,Quality fan that pushes a lot of air but too loud at low setting.,"This is definitely a quality fan that pushes a lot more air than the standard Walmart box fan. It has black metal blades, not plastic and a quality cord. The only gripe I have is I wish the low setting went lower. At the low setting, it still pushes a lot of air and as a result is still noise. It would be nice if the three settings had a wider speed control since the air turbulence at the blades creates the noise. Noise wise, this creates about the same amount of noise on high as the standard box fan on high but pushes a lot more air and has a slightly lower pitch. I will keep the fan despite the noise but if I had it to do over, I would look for a fan that had a wider speed variance across the three speed settings. If you don't care that much about noise, I don't see any downside."
5,The Perfect Fan,"Let me say I did a lot of research on fans before making this purchase. My requirement was that it be made in the U.S. and it be of good quality. I was hoping to find a fan that had a lot of power (which is CFMs') and would not be too noisy. This fan exceeded my expectations by far. It is very heavy-duty and well-made. It is somewhat more noisy than the cheaper box-type fans you get at Wal-Mart; however, this is a more commercial-type fan that will hold up for years to come. Thanks to Air King for making a fan of great quality and especially for keeping those jobs in America. Highly recommend."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS FAN FROM AMAZON,I paid for next day delivery and it did not come. I was refunded the next day fee. When the product was finally delivered it literally was a ball of cardboard and plastic wrap. The frame is bent so you cannot tilt the fan and the control is broken.The kicker of the whole thing is that the only reason I bought it at Amazon was because I had a gift certificate to use. I found the fan at competitors web-sites for $20 less including shipping. Google Air King 9220 before buying this via Amazon.
2,Annoying rattling,I purchased this fan because I can't sleep without the sound of a fan running. The fan is powerful and sometimes all you hear is the blades spinning. Other times the fan makes an annoying rattling that doesn't stop unless I point it directly at the ceiling.
5,GREAT FAN,I USE THIS FAN IN MY GARAGE AND IT WORKS GREAT. IT REALLY MOVES SOME AIR. I WISH THAT I HAD BOUGHT THIS FAN LONG AGO. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FAN
4,Powerful Metal Floor Fan,"Air King is powerful, although a bit noisy, its white noise is, in fact, a comfort to me while I sleep. It is easy to clean. Overall a good value for a big metal fan that delivers a lot of air."
1,It just fell apart,"I purchased the Air King fan and had it for 2 1/2 weeks. It worked well during that time. Then ... it just fell apart. The motor is mounted on the back grill and several of the welds that hold it in place broke. It is unusable and unrepairable. The seller, S&C Greenworld Supply, told me I should contact the manufacturer, so far another dead end."
5,Excellent,"I had one of these for many years- it recently stopped working. I bought two this time - they are great, powerful fans."
1,Poor Product Quality,"I purchased this fan less than six months ago to keep the air circulating in the mini-gym in my basement. This morning while I was running, I heard this awful banging noise coming from the fan. It turns out that the plastic ""contraption"" holding the motor BROKE and the blades were spinning and hitting the metal case! I've learned my lesson; I'm sticking with PATTON (even if they have outsourced to China)."
4,Great roots rock from a talented songwriter!,"The third CD from this Washington, DC area band fronted by singer/guitarist/songwriter Karl Straub. Great roots rock sound with all original songs. Keeps your toes tappin' and your voice hummin' all the way through."
5,REAL RAP!,KRS-1's best release after the BDP LP's. His subject matter is truly remarkable. His visuals hypnotize you and take you to where the story is at the moment. Extremely DOPE around the board! 10 stars!!!
3,Not his strongest effort but still good,"Boogie Down Productions leader KRS-One's reputation began to slip in the early '90s, as he spent more time educating than performing. He hit back at his critics with the slamming Return of the Boom Bap, his first official solo release. Leaving behind the detailed production of the last BDP album Sex and Violence, Boom Bap returns the MC to the spare, gritty territory of Criminal Minded. KRS-One sounds reinvigorated, as well, spitting out his rhymes with fury and intelligence. Although the record isn't as didatic as Edutainment or Sex and Violence, KRS-One hasn't made his lyrics simplistic, nor has he abandoned his cutting, intelligent social commentary. The combination of hard, basic beats and exciting rhymes makes Rerturn of the Boom Bap a genuine comeback for KRS-One, one of the founding figures of modern hip-hop."
1,Epicene Dandy Strikes A Pose,"People dump on Kris ever since his transformation into epicene pop sensation Michael Jackson, but you gotta give him props for being versatile. The vagaries of the market and the stress of spaning widely divergent genres have forced him/her into some very awkward positions, to say the least. First, he/she is derided as a sell-out after the runaway worldwide success of her Thriller album two decades ago. Then, to restore his street cred, he resumes the bad@ss macho posturing to give a shout out to his homeboy Osama, thus giving a delicious frisson of aging enfant terrible to his already schizophrenic image. But all those years of groping little boys and slicing up his face to look like Diana Ross have rendered the carefully crafted image permanently bogus. Castrati can never become gangstas again, no matter how many hormone injections they take at Swedish transgender clinics. Miss Swish should have stayed in her closet and faded into well-deserved obscurity. Peace."
5,a hiphop classic,"The worst krs album! what! this is the best solo krs album. he hasn't become overly preachy yet, great old school beats, clever lyricist. this is a CLASSIC."
4,KRS drops the bomb in 93!!!!,"Krs-One returned with a vengeance in 93, and dropped a CLASSIC in the form of Return Of The Boom Bap. This album, like every other Krs-One album, represents him in his truest form, always talking about something positive, claiming to be ""the teacher"" of hip hop, and saying things to leave you thinking. Here's the review:Album Highlights: Krs-One Attacks, Outta Here, Black Cop, Mortal Thought, I Can't Wake Up, Sound Of Da Police, Mad Crew, and Return Of The Boom Bap.Production: Thumbs up.Lyrics and Subject Matter: Thumbs up.Originality: Thumbs up.The Last Word: While NOT as strong as Criminal Minded and By All Means Necessary, this is still Krs at his best. Today, he still remains one of the most influential MCs out there keeping his legacy alive. Overall, I recommend you pick up this album."
2,Tried TWO of these - would be great if they actually worked,"I keep an office of 35 running, including coffee. I was very happy when I first bought this. It worked great, coffee tasted good, I only had to make coffee once in the morning. Unfortunately, a few weeks after we started using it, , it started ""re-perking"" my coffee when it wasn't supposed to, several times a morning, and burned it - YUK. I called Mr. Coffee and they sent another one out right away - great service. But the second one started doing the same thing. No more Mr. Coffee urns for this office!"
5,Best urn I've used,"I teach writing classes and provide coffee for my students -- this is the best urn I've seen/tried -- and the ""how much is left"" gauge is so convenient. It also heats more quickly than any other urn I've had."
4,Was a great urn,"My wife and I have owned a few coffee urns over the past two decades and the Mr. Coffee 45-cup urn was the best. It was attractive, reliable and study, even with heavy use. Ours would runs straight for 24 hours over a period of two or three days at a time. Similar usage caused low end urns to eventually corrode, leak, and in a couple of cases shorting dangerously, within two to three years. Conversely, the Mr. Coffee 45-cup urn has performed and held up well for several years at that rate before finally ceasing to heat.Unfortunately, I can no longer give this product 5 stars. According to the only service center in our area, Mr. Coffee is no longer providing replacement parts related to the heating unit. So, whereas it may last longer than other brands, once this coffee urn breaks, unless it's still under the replacement warrantee, it's toast. As a result, we're considering starting our shopping research from scratch rather than just buying another Mr. Coffee urn outright."
2,Worked fine when it did,"This coffee urn did make good coffee, was easy to use and clean, and I thought was fairly well made. Problem is 2 years down the road it is no longer working and in need of parts and the only part available is the spigot for $9 which is not what I need. I figured that for about $100 it should have lasted better than 2 years and if I could get the parts I at least would still be able to fix and use it. Heat element inside corroded so badly and now it will not perk and just heats the water in the bottom."
5,Peruvians have it.,"My daughter is doing some volunteer work outside of Lima, its capital. So for a Christmas gift and quick Amazon search, this came back. I listened to its samples and was readily convinced that she would enjoy this. I found I did. It is the type of music that seems to make you happy and joyful. Their are many distinct and musically ""colorful"" instruments and threads going on. Placed on my modern sound system, I can just imagine the the Peruvians enjoying their summer evenings with these tunes tugging on side walkers to come on in. Oh well, from some of her experiences and pictures, it's colorful and ......"
4,pretty good for everyday wear,"I am pretty satisfied with it since I wanted something simple enough and casual to wear everyday and also with a leather band. The leather band suits me perfectly because I have very small writs, so if you have a regular or large wrists make sure before you order that it will fit."
2,Low quality - avoid it,"I recently purchased this TV stand for my 27"" flatscreen Panasonic TV, and I am not impressed.The assembly was fairly easy.Now, for my complaints:The wood is cheap, weak particle board.The clips that hold the glass doors to the magnets are way too big. They slide around and fall off easily. Customer service told me to tighten them by pinching them in my fingers. That only closes the bottoms of them. The tops are still very loose and move around a lot.Worst of all, when I set my 95 pound TV on top, the top sags a few eighths of an inch so the doors won't close without scraping the top. I had to adjust the hinges to get the doors to close, but now the tops of the doors are almost touching each other while the bottoms are 3/8"" apart. Customer service didn't know what to say about this. (The stand is rated for 135 pounds.)"
3,There's nothing else to buy for this location.,"It's a 60min. video made in 1993 with poor picture quality. It visits: Aruba, Curacao, Barbados, Martinique, St.Maarten, St. Thomas, St. Croix, and Puerto Rico. Too much time is spent telling you the names of all the shops and what they sell."
5,Beautiful Three Tier Earrings,"My favorite earrings! Complete style and comfortable. The gemstones are genuine (sterling silver and real gemstones, imagine that).Kathy's attention to detail really shows in this design."
2,Meandering Madeleine,"I can take weird. In fact I like weird. This book however, was way out there and not in a good way. It tried to be lyrical prose - kind of sing-along style with no coherent flow. I was disappointed because I like the idea behind the book and the cover piqued my interest. This writer has talent but it felt like she was cooking up a bunch of hors d'oeuvres and then serving them without a tray, napkins or toothpicks. My taste-buds were left dry."
2,"Quality writing, but I didn't get the point of it...","Really odd little book; I liked the quality of Bynum's writing, but not so much her story. It was a little too weird and not in a good way. I was bored by some of it and I didn't really see the point. I'm a little surprised by the 5-star reviews, but I guess this is one where it either grabs you or it doesn't, and it didn't grab me. Good try, though."
4,Good Product,"Purchased this product for using with Smartphone.SmartPhone: Samsung Galaxy SNavigator: Google NavigationConnection: Bluetooth GPS Mouse from Argotronic - Android Market Place.Had Pharos bluetooth GPS. Due to both Samsung Galaxy S built-in GPS and Pharos GPS no/delay starting, I decided to purchase this product after reading reviews.It starts very fast within 10-20 sec, almost all times start within seconds.Very satisfied with this product except one thing. Always about 5-10 meters behind on GPS than actual location. I am not sure if this problem is from the product or my smartphone."
4,they were ahead of there time but...,"if they camed out now they wouldn't sound much different from todays uptempo r&b.but at the time they were verry fresh and new.i always remembered the songs keep on movin,and back to life.i liked keep on movin but i never liked back to life.i just never knew who made these till early this year. plus i didn't know they were from the uk either.this album prooves that teddy reily didn't make the new jack swing era all by his self.some might say that the newjack swing era sound totally different from soul 2 soul's sound.but they both concintrate on dance r&b with a hip hop beat.but like i said if they had camed out now they wouldn't be anything new. production wise they would sound better from the rest.but thats where the inovation will end.the roots,the goodiemob,etc sounds just like them."
5,soul II soul - club classics 10th anniversary edition,"I dont think we ever took this album out of the player for years, every party it was played, in the car, at the beach, it was the 80's funkiest pre-rap album, they just have ""it"" = pure funk & rythm. BACK TO LIFE (acapella version) makes me think i can sing well when ever it is on as i can't help myself,KEEP ON MOVIN & JAZZIE'S GROOVE reminds me of the London nightclubs. This album is a must. Last time i had this on tape i had to press the fast forward button & wait not it on cd! brilliant! even like the new Ambition Rap! might look at their other albums."
1,NotSoft/Deffective,"I promptly returned this pillow. Near the zippered end were large irregular holes where the foam did not completely fill the mould. It was also too hard and uncomfortable. I assumed ErgoSoft meant Soft. I also assumed they would return the $12.00 they made me pay to return it, because of the defect. Of course they did not, they only refunded the price of the pillow itself."
5,Excellent,Exactly as described. Soft and extremely comfortable.Comes complete with cover.It's sort of like resting your head on a cloud. Memory foam pillows are poor and hard by comparison.
5,Goodbye Memory Foam,"I bought this pillow to give it a try. I sleep with two pilows on either side of me and turn between the two at night. Well, i had my memory foam pillow on one side and this one on the other. I have woken up to this pillow every day. This thing is exremely comfortable. Now that this review reminder shows me where i bought it, i am going to buy another one."
3,not worth it,"i bought this car seat and the matching stroller mainly because i liked the fabric. its cute but baby sweats too much in it. its also really small/narrow which makes it hard to get my baby in and out and he is barely 11 lbs. another thing is u cant use the carseat without the base. oh, and the belt snaps are made it seems from really cheap plastic. for an expensive car seat it is missing alot."
2,child out grows fast and HOT,"As with the other reviews I have been reading, my child is 21 1/2"" long and weighs just over 11lbs. She is already outgrowing this cars seat, and she is always sweating in this seat. It is easy to use, but for the money, I thought I would be able to use it longer than what I'm going to be able to use it for. She was almost 7lbs when born and was cramed into the seat, I had to take the head support out right from the begin because the seat is so narrow, you don't need it anyways."
3,Most expensive is not always best,"Good Points: Easily adjustable straps make it easy to fit to baby's size as he grows; Padding and padded straps are very comfortable; easy to get in and out of car; handle adjusts down to balance seat when out of base; handle not ergonomic. Negative Points: Mfg should stress that seat only fits infants up to 26 inches!!; baby sweats in seat no matter what we do (lighter close, blanket underneath him, etc.); does not snap on to shopping carts. I wrote to mfg and they claim that it will snap on to SOME shopping carts. I have not been able to do this."
4,Good Product,We bought this product from The Baby Catalog and it included the base. It is a great product. It was at first difficult to install in our minivan; when placed in the Venezia Stroller it seems to be a little loose for my liking.
4,love the safety ratings..,"but the hood for shade doesn't stay down to block out the sun. the seat is very well padded therefore, gives bigger babies less room to move...my son is not real happy about that. once i was able to remove the head support i was surprised how much more room he has. i would highly recommend this car seat as it it has very high safety ratings and to me that is the most important."
3,"Heavy, but strong!","We have two of these car seats- bought them used from another mother of twins, who used them for a year & they looked brand new.These seats are a lot heavier than most other car seats, but that doesn't seem to bother us too much as we feel these are so sturdy & easy to maneuver.The biggest downfall to these is that the umbrella does not cover much of your baby- others have two umbrellas that offer complete shade and sleep privacy, while this one can barely shield from the sun (we end up using a blanket- thrown over the entire seat).We paid half price for theses, as they were used & I'm not sure I would pay full price, as they are heavy & the umbrella aspect is a big deal if your a mom that will be out & about a lot."
3,Too heavy with baby in it!,My son is almost 7 weeks old. He weighed 8lbs 14ozs at birth. I had a C-section and of course couldn't carry him in it. But my husband did. He is a big strong guy and he even commented how heavy it was with our son in it. I haven't been out to the stores yet by myself with my son but I know that I will have a difficult time getting him in and out of the car with this carrier. It's ashame because I love the look of it. We also have the Peg Perego Vennzia stroller and we LOVE that. It closes easily and it's light weight. And I love the way it rides.Just check out the weight of this before you purchase it. If you find it heavy before the baby is in it. Just imagine what it will be like with your baby in it.By the way my son sleeps in the carrier attached to the stroller every night. It's the only way he'll sleep for long periods if time.
4,Great travel system,This travel system is very easy to use! Make sure the car seat works in your car before purchasing. The new base does not work in some cars!
2,"Looks great,but not practical","Love the fabric and look, but the car seat is very heavy, and I was very disappointed to find out that you can't travel without the base. What a pain it will be to lug this heavy car seat & base when I travel! The Pliko stroller is five stars though."
2,Don't buy this carseat if you plan on flying,"Unlike most carseats the Peg Perego does not have slots in the carrier to secure onto the seatbelt of a plane. If you plan on flying, you have to bring the huge bulky base with you. If I bought the Graco, I would not have to lug that big awkard base with me everywhere at the airport!I also found the carseat to be difficult to use. It is heavier than most and not as easy to snap in and out of the car."
