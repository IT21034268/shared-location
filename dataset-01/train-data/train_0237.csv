1,Disappointing,"I have to agree with other reviewers. This book was disappointing. I didn't like the characters, they had potential that never developed. I thought the plot was disjointed and confusing. By the end I really didn't care about any of them. I was so sick of the 'alpha' male thinking 'get out of the kill zone' I was ready to kill him myself. I normally LOVE Jennifer Crusie's books, but I had to rate this one a one star read."
1,Major Disappointment,"This book was extremely disappointing. Not what I have come to expect in a Jennifer Crusie novel. It was hard to read, the characters pathetic and the story was so slow that halfway through I jumped pages....Don't waste your time, read one of her older books they are MUCH better."
1,What HAPPENED?????,"What happened to you Jennifer Crusie???? Please,please,please go back to writing by yourself! No offense but I had to force myself to read this book,in the hope of it getting better or even interesting! I waited so long for something from JC and I get this!! Where is the humor and romance of it all ? This is the only book of hers that I haven't loved and read over and over. If ur a JC fan skip this book! Don't waste your time or money! Sorry to be harsh , but this book is definitely below par!"
4,Different - but still good!,"Don't count me among those that were diappointed that this wasn't the usual Crusie frothy romanctic romp. I thought that the his/hers point of view storytelling worked well. It contained the Crusie things I love - unique heroine, screwed up family, snappy banter and offbeat music references. If you can't keep up with it when you first pick it up, stay with it and you'll be rewarded."
2,Male and female minds inhabit same book - run!,"Well, I had to read it even though the reviews weren't promising. What I liked about having it written by both a man and woman is that the male mind was portrayed more realistically than it usually is in books written by females. What I didn't like is that they didn't blend well together. At all.Could better editing have saved this book? Probably, although I have a mental picture of the editor being transported to a mental health facility after trying..."
2,Tough to get into,"I agree with the other reviewers that noted this book was difficult to ""get into"". I found the writing style to be disjointed, jumpy, and a detraction from the storyline. Not likely to spend $$$ on Crusie again, as this should have been an easy, enjoyable read and not torture."
1,Terrrible,"Put simply - don't waste your money or time on this. I've read a number of Jennifer Crusie and expected a funny, well-constructed read. Instead, I found a confusing tale peopled with characters I couldn't care about.There are too many characters and stories competing for space here, the result of which is that nothing gets enough attention to make you care and the characters are cardboard. There are also a number of points where the story seems to jump or miss something - but I couldn't even care enough to figure out what I'd missed.The only consolation is that it was 50 per cent discounted, even in hardback (which says it all, I suspect, about sales) but I'm still sorry I wasted the cash on this sloppy junk."
1,Don't Look Down,"It is difficult to believe Jennifer Cruisie actually had a part in writing this book. It reads like a macho male author deep into special forces effects and language. Where is the quick wit and laugh out loud comedy she is known for? Not here, for sure. There is nothing clever or funny about this book at all. Please return to your own style."
1,Waste of Time,"This was the first time I've read either author and I never will again. Story was BEYOND slow, characters and dialogue unrealistic and boring. Don't bother with it, reading bad books just isn't necessary."
1,Waste of Time,"The one thing that will turn me off from a book in a hurry is the fast introduction of too many characters in the first few pages. I like to have characters brought in a few at the time, and have a little development before others come in. But in this book so many people were brought in on the first few pages I found myself turning back to see who was who. I was only able to get thru about a dozen pages when I thought ""do I want to spend anymore of my day reading this?"" Nope. I was very surprised to find that Jennifer Cruise would write a book this bad."
2,Hard to get into,"This is my 2nd Jennifer Crusie novel borrowed on digital audio from my library. It was definitely hard to get into and I ended up not finishing the book even though I was less than 1/4 of the way through. The audio for the male part was horrible, it sounded like he was in another room when this was recorded. It distracted entireley from the story.Perhaps I'll try it in book form at some other time. :0)"
2,too many names,I love jennifer cruise so I thought well a new book to read. Wow I did not like this. The people go by there last names by some people and first by others and there are too many people to do that lol.I agree with what one perosn said about jt jumping into bed with the lead actress and I just could not get over that. It was like no please no.If you liked this book I am glad you found something you like about it.I will say again I normally and all about her books
1,Uggg---Could not get past first 50 pages,"The characters were shallow. The story dragged. I could not get engauged. I am usally easy to please. I have read over 2000 romance novels in past 10 years and I would give at least 90% 4-5*s. So this book must be really baaaadddd to get 1*. In fact, I would give it a 0* if I could. I have enjoyed Jennifer Crusis' books before, it was like the magic writing button was turned off when she was writing this one."
2,Where's the Humor?,"I love Jennifer Crusie books, and have read all of her previous novels. However, this book seemed too much action novel/romance/back to action. It has a split personality, and lacks the wonderful humor of Crusie's other books. Even the one eyed alligator named Moot misses the opportunity to be funny, and the idea that a child speaks without contractions to show that she is a child is a bit strained. I think that the action author should stick to action, and that Ms. Crusie should go back to the sort of writing that has given her such a large fan base. The combination was not appealing, and I wouldn't recommend purchasing the hard cover. You could wait for the paperback on this one, and even then, borrow it from someone else if you don't want to be disappointed."
4,great information,"a really great directed approach for attachment style parenting. my only criticism is that the intended audience seems to be moms who are able to stay at home and dads that are away all day in the workforce. there aren't any approaches or direction for moms that need to return to work and dads who stay home, or for both working parents. it would be great to just be able to make the choice to not use babysitters, but that is not a viable option for a large majority of parents these days."
5,if you have a fussy one...,"In all honesty, I have not yet finished this book due to my very fussy baby. But I have made it about half way and wow, it makes me want to cry to know that it is not just my mothering - I have a high need baby and unlike what everyone has been telling me; I have been doing everything right. It is wonderful to hear these things, unlike the normal advice of ""you know, you just need to make her cry it out"" that makes me want to slap the person in the face! This book makes parents of fussy babies feel ok about themselves again. A must read if you have a fussy baby and need to read something positive about them!"
4,mighty island rhythms,"Mighty Sparrow once again provides a series of classic rhythms for soca fans in need of a lift. The beats are strong, and as usual the lyrics celebrate the comical side of the human experience. Definitely a worthwhile listen."
4,Carnival of my childhood & before- good memories,Love these songs...reminds me of my childhood in T'dad. These are the hits my parents & grandparents were always humming and many of the songs I knew most of the words to.
5,Fraggels are The Best!,"I absolutely loved watching Fraggel Rock growing up, and finding this video in the grocery store was a real find! Anyone who has not seen the Fraggels, you must invest!"
5,"Yes, 2006 has both","For some reason, the description of the 2006 single-disc version of this is incorrect. It is not 114m but 230, just like the 2000 edition, containing both versions of the film on a double-sided disc and including the commentary which addresses the differences. Currently the 2006 edition is five bucks cheaper. So,save your money and go for the 2006. And you don't have to screw around with a snap case."
1,Not the Afterlife from the Hed Kandi label..,"I was profoundly disappointed when I received this disc and realized it was by the wrong band.. This is the ""Surreality"" Afterlife, not the ""Simplicity 2000"" Afterlife from the Hed Kandi record label.. But hey, if this is the band you're looking for, maybe you'll like it."
2,This is a rerelease,"This album was originally written and recorded in 1993 which is why it sounds so dated. It was an experimental album I made with a couple of friends while I was making house music professionally and has been rereleased by BMP with a load of dodgy video footage that was never approved by me and, most annoyingly, it is not described as a rerelease which is untruthful to say the least."
3,Intrigue,"Quenby Swenson is hired to as a nanny for little Andrew Ramsey. Her special skills and tenacious love will be needed for little Andrew's special abilities. Gunner Nilsen, a member of the mysterious Clanad, goes along to protect Andrew and his new pretty nanny. Gunner and Quenby learn to trust each other and come together through their love of a special little boy."
5,Great resource!,This book is amazing. I keep it handy at home to help answer my questions or learn more about the disease. My daughter was diagnosed with retinoblastoma right before Christmas and this book was given to us by a social worker in the hospital. There is an entire chapter about retinoblastoma as well as chapters on many other solid tumor cancers. There are real stories from parents and it is written in language that is informative but easy to understand. It is especially helpful right after diagnosis when all of the jargon is still new. I would caution people to take the advice given in the book and only read sections that are relevant to your situation at the time.
5,Another Travel Perspective,"We purchased this book while in Wyoming after we came across the Roadside Wyoming book at Devil's Tower. The geology so intrigued us and the kids that finding this book in the National Park Service store made our summer trip even more enjoyable. As you travel through Yellowstone, this book is like a personal guide to the geologic features. It goes beyond the typical travel guide explaining the sites since it is from the geologic perspective. We have purchased other titles in this series after our Wyoming/Yellowstone purchase. Recommended reading as you travel through Yellowstone."
4,Nice sturdy stand,"I spent a lot of time researching these stands on Amazon and finally decided to purchase this one. It does what it promises to do. My 32"" LCD TV sits comfortably on it, and the DVD player is right underneath. So far we havent seen any bouncing. If you experience bouncing, make sure you have it set up the right way. The curvy legs should be in the back, not in front.Also, Amazon has the dimension all wrong. The dimension they listed are for the junior stand, not this one. This one is way bigger. Its better if you go to Allsop website and take a look at the stands as well as dimension before you purchase.Last but not least, it looks like Amazon sends us one that has been returned by someone else. It doesnt have any dents or big scratches, but doesnt mean you cannot notice. Im not gonna take points off of the product, because this is a seller issue. But I thought you should be aware of this."
2,Not for me,I did not like the look or size of this stand when it arrived. It was bigger than I expected and took up too much of my desk. I returned it right away.
4,Nice Little Stand,"Not quite what I was looking for, but should fit the bill very nicely for computer monitors and LCDs."
4,a much needed addition,"For those wanting an orientation to the breadth of Christian thinking on the proper relationship between Church and State, particularly as it concerns war, there is no more current collection than this one. Particularly in times when many churchgoers in the West may be wondering whether it is right to be waging war against a largely unknown enemy, this collection is startingly broad and eminently readable. Rempel, furthermore, is no mere academic, but an accomplished peace practitioner working at the United Nations."
5,Excellent read,"Found most of the stories in this collection to be on the Stephen King side of writing. The story about the children at the beach was particularly fascinating. The writer seems to have a thing for death and baseball, in a whimsical sort of way.Judging by the gentleman's photo, he seems like a normal sort - but I'm not sure I'd want to meet him in person. Quite bizarre!"
5,Mastery and mayhem - a fictional rollercoaster!,"I haven't had this much fun inside of a book in years! I.J. Schecter is truly one of Canada's fastest rising literary stars - someone, I hope, is paying attention to this kid. There's everything in here: sex, violence, terror, romance, giggles, blood curdling screams and belly laughs."
5,Just a part,"This is just a part. It fit my extension piece very well. Packaged well and easy to put on. Might want to use a good tape to attach the aluminum plates though. If rubber end caps come off at an inconvenient place, plates will fall out and be lost."
4,Replacement caps were an exact fit,The caps fit the ladder perfectly. Tried to find caps at local stores and ended up at this site--should have started here first.
4,Good wise daily reading,"I like Emmet Fox because of his wisdom and the sane thinking he presents. Its a little hard to get the message every 10th page if you don't know the bible, but his daily reflections are deep!"
5,This is the best devotional I think I've ever read.,Emmett Fox is full of God's wisdom. This devotional styled book gave me peace in daily small doses.
4,Around the year with Emmet Fox,"I am a member of A.A..I heard Emmet Fox was instumental in the early years of the fellowship. I was interested in what he had to say. This book has become part of my daily readings along with ""Daily Reflections"" and ""Twenty-Four Hours a Day"".Daily Reflections: A Book of Reflections by A.A. Members for A.A. Members"
5,Basic Spiritual Truths,"Emmet Fox strips away all the trappings of theology and religion and goes to the heart of the ""Christ Truth"" that is mentioned so many times in his book The Sermon on the MountThe Sermon on the Mount: The Key to Success in Life. He takes us back to living our lives daily by the basic teachings of love of God and our fellow man as our guide through the study of the words of Jesus in the Scriptures. Very down-to-earth!"
3,Knocks Fox,"Everything I've read from Fox has a few brilliant insights, then a bunch of useless filler. This is no different."
5,Absolutely love this daily meditation book!,I love how the daily reading is something that sticks with me and seems appropriate for that day. It's easy to read and understand and is helping me in my walk with God.
3,Good,"though I liked the few recipes I've tried, my kids aren't as crazy about them as I was. The idea of healthier menus was great, but in reality it doesn't always work. One book that I found that has holiday recipes, too, and a bunch of leftover recipes for all that turkey and ham afterwards is THE FRANTIC WOMAN'S GUIDE TO FEEDING FAMILY AND FRIENDS."
5,Beautiful Food For Celebrations!,"I bought this book last year and used the Thanksgiving recipes. This was the first Thanksgiving I ever hosted at my house, and thanks to this book, it was a HUGE success. Not only does the book provide the grocery list and recipes, it also provides detailed discussions about various cooking techniques, organizational tips, and timelines to help you get your act together and keep it that way clear through until your event is over.The turkey we made using Leanne's recipe and treatment recommendations was OUTSTANDING, the best turkey I ever ate much less cooked.I highly recommend this book for domestically challenged OR beginner cooks/hostesses who wish to create beautiful celebrations with great food."
3,Waste of money; we didn't study a lot on this book,"Okay the book itself is a good one for grammar learning but I believe the grammar is not a big issue that we need to buy a book costs over than 40 bucks. Come on let's be clear, The grammar comes with practicing and listening to native speakers. so we don't need to waste money on text books that we even don't cover in the class."
5,good,The book was bought for someone else and it served its purpose. It came without the CD but in good shape.
1,Très mauvais !,"Des écritures dans tous le manuel alors qu'il était sencé tre ""quasiment neuf"". Un vendeur que je ne recommanderais à personne."
5,"A+ Focus on Grammar 4 (text only) 3rd (Third) edition by M. Fuchs, M. Bonner (Purchased on 02/15/2012)","a+ Focus on Grammar 4 (text only) 3rd (Third) edition by M. Fuchs, M. Bonner (Purchased on 02/15/2012)by n/a"
2,This book was kinda boring.,"I liked the Timothy Zahn terminator book, so I picked this one up. Take my review with a grain of salt: I didn't get past the first couple chapters. The writing style and pacing of this book was too boring for me to finish. Maybe it gets better later on in the book... I don't know. But I didn't enjoy what I read of it."
1,Would not have given any stars but that was not an option.......,"This would have been a perfect match with the exception that I was not able to program the device and use the clicker What the pictures do not tell you is that it did not have a panic button on the back of the clicker. Without the panic button, I was unable to follow the programming instructions. In the program instructions, it called for you to press the panic button. How can I press something that is not there!!!!!! I was not able to use this item and would have returned it had I not have used it for spare parts to repair the old key fob......."
2,nothing special,This book was a disappointment. The main character was annoying and there was barely any plot. The main character Tanya even describes her own life as boring. Who wants to read about a boring life. Tanya wallows in self-pity and is one of the least likeable female characters in literature. This book has received some acclaim and I have no idea why. It was a complete waste of time and rather depressing.
3,Chick-Lit with Telegraphed Punch,"============Ms. Vapnyar constructs lovely sentences of well-chosen words. The main story is juxtaposed with a fabricated diary of Dostoevsky's mistress, whom the heroine, Tanya, of ""Memoirs"" admires. The entire book is set in Simoncini Garamond, but a second typeface would have served well to delineate between Tanya's writing and the 19th Century diaries of Polina. (This book was published by Mark Z. Danielewski's house, Pantheon Books. They *know* about typeface changes!)""Memoirs"" would have been an excellent piece of short fiction, but it's been padded at the beginning with 88 pages of narrative about the female protagonist's childhood which does nothing for the story. This is almost half of the 212-page book. The second half of the book is much better than the first 88 pages."
5,The master in his very own words,"It is almost never that a CD of music of Rimsky-Korsakov or any of the Russian five does not quotes a line or two from this autobiography.In it the composer himself tells about his life,works,and also about those that were fortunate enough to be close to him.He speaks of every aspect of his life with specific details....I wish to tell you more,but I would really like for you to read the book..."
3,Tough going,Dark and cerebral. May have been the inspiration for Apocalypse Now. Difficult to imagine all that inner dialog being part of an oral narrative.
3,Interesting,"Marlowe, hired by an ivory company, is sent into the heart of the Congo to find an man named Kurtz. Along the way he hears off the many myths surrounding Kurtz. Kurtz is supposedly the greatest agent of the company. When Marlowe finds this man, he finds a sickly insane man. Kurtz has some how made himself into a god in the eyes of the natives. Marlowe retrieves this man and begins his journey back listening to the strange talk of Kurtz. This book takes some effort to read and is not all that interesting. Conrad does point out some interesting things the insides of the human mind. It may be a good book to read if you enjoy such things. Ken R."
3,Didn't Conrad know we were blind to good literature?,"This is a very unusual book, dealing with colonialism, barbarianism, insanity and mental torment. Unfortunetly the Author, Joseph Conrad, has written more than I, and most people will ever be able to grasp with our simple minds that cherish only literal things like M-TV and McDonalds. Yes, I, as a highschool student found this book incredibly tedious and hard to read, but I know that there is so much inside this book. It is a shame that when something truely real comes along, no one is smart enough to realize it. Perhaps Conrad should have known this, since he seems to know so much about the human soul, and not written his book in this unusuall method."
3,Heart of Darkness,I found this book somewhat difficult to read and comprehend. It was much deeper that I care to read.
3,a disappointing classic,"This novella is one of those classics that people talk about more often than read. THere are references to it everywhere, from Apocalyse Now to journalism about Africa. Well, I sat down to read it and was unimpressed. Perhaps it is the horror COnrad wants to portray that put me off, but I didn't find it very believable and couldn't allow myself to be swept into the world he portrays. One of my tests for a book is that it makes me want to learn more, to go to other sources, and this one just didn't."
2,The horror! The horror!,"This book was very hard to understand. There were too many words. These words cluttered up what was really going on in the book. The only reason why I read it was because I was assigned it for college. If you are having trouble falling asleep, read this book. I guarantee it will put you to sleep."
2,Two stars for being short,Boring! I understood the point (darkness within the human soul) but I hate weeding through all the excess writing to get to it. Give your characters some life!
5,A Brilliant Novella,"Conrad writes with the sort of depth rarely exhibited by an English language writer. This is one of the most challenging and best written books that I have ever read. Some of the quotes alone could be collected into a masterpiece. Attention should be paid to the dream-like narrative of Marlow's tale (if you must know - of a European man traveling into the heart of Africa). Conrad understood many things about human nature which are buried in the text. This is not just a colonial novel. The major accomplishment here is combining smart philosophy with a deft style, something rarely achieved by writers bent on espousing their views. This is an important book and should not be missed by anyone interested in superb writing and great literature."
1,A convoluted load of bollocks!,"If your idea of a good time is reading a book that feels like it's entirely exposition (eschewing such literary novelties as, say, rising action, or a real climax), then ""Heart of Darkness"" is for you and stay away from me! The gist of the book is that white people who think they're civilized are actually far more savage than the ""barbarians"" they try to ""civilize."" I could've got the same lesson by listening to a Midnight Oil song and gotten on with my life, rather than wading through this detail-drenched, pompously ""symbolic"" waste of time.I'm not one of those people who insists that a book contain a sex scene or violent act every few pages to keep my attention, but NOTHING HAPPENS in this whole book! We're supposed to be supremely affected by it all. Life's too short for this kind of bombast. -Chris Willie Williams"
3,Notes in the margins.,"I got through Heart of Darkness by writing myself notes in the margins to help me figure out and remember what was happening. If you're being forced to read this, look at it from an analytical point of view and you might get through it. See it as an object to be studied rather than a thing to be enjoyed.After I was finished, the one question I asked myself was, ""what was I supposed to get from this?"" Heart of Darkness is dense and bland, however, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be explored.I explored it, and am appreciative for the experience; but, don't hold your breath waiting for me to pick it up again any time soon."
3,interesting,"I was turned on to this book after reading ""Rivers Ran East"". It was a book about head hunting and traveling down the Amazon. This is an interesting book, but not quite as good. It seems like it was made as a child's book (not a bad thing...if you're a child). I enjoyed it anyway. It seems like the author focuses on story telling rather than getting to a greater purpose. I would recommend ""Rivers Ran East"" before reading this."
3,Free SF Reader,"There is both a literal and a metaphorical heart of darkness here as man journeys from boring old England to the unknown Belgian Congo. That unknown is the physical heart of darkness.The other heart is the psychology of the man himself, and the man that he meets there."
4,Powerful Even Today,"This is a brilliant book that captures what can happen to man when he believes in his own power too much. As one who has traveled up the Congo River himself, I am amazed at Conrad's ability to capture a place so well."
5,the darkness of man has never been so ....dark,This book will take you on a journey and as you go deeper into the jungle you fall deeper into the dept of mans corruptibility. This book is brutal and honest. Marlow is the type of good man that does nothing and his goal is the type of man that has fallen from everything. Marlow ends up seeing the very essence of the darkness of men. You realize that he too could be corrupted just as easily by this evil that has stolen his targets soul. I too felt that I could be corrupted by the same evil if I was in their place. That is the scariest thing of all. I felt disgustingly empowered by this book and by the end I had chills down my spine at the absurdity of that perceived power and the great cost it took on all the innocents around it.
2,"Ugh, is it over yet?","I only read this because someone else was telling me it was one of the favorite books and it was so hard to get through! I think I read 2 or 3 other books before I came back to finish this one. Drawn out, slow, BORING!"
2,Out in a time warp,I can't get in to it enough to care about the characters. It is wandering and going nowhere. I have to keep leafing back every time I open it up to remind myself of what is going on. I will probably end up skip reading it.
2,Fair. Not a must-read by any means.,The book seems dated. Had i read it 40-50 years ago it might have made a more favorable impression. I've heard the story many times before and I'm sure I'll hear it again in the future.
2,Read it once..but never again!.,"Heart of DarknessReading the first pages was a pleasure, surely I was reading art. But like a lot of things, my first impression was faulty and the writing style ground to a drudge.The story is a simple one; a sailor who can't find employment must accept one far off in Africa. His attitude towards Africans was the attitude of the white world. His attitude towards the business of ivory was that of the ""company"".I don't believe the author intended any great statement of humanity. I think he just thought it was a good story. Huckleberry and Tom's use of the ""N"" word is nothing to the uses of human slanders in this book.I will not read this book again. It would be instructive for people who are interested in the truth of how the white race discounted the black race and abused them.This was a Kindle book which I received free. Gotta love it!"
2,short but not so sweet,I'm going to be a high school senior next year and I chose to read this for my summer reading. It's really short but it doesn't go by fast. I constantly had to reread pages because I was missing things. It's really hard to follow and the plot is a little slow. Maybe the 700 page Anna Karenina would have gone by faster...
5,Human Nature.,This book is beautifully disturbing at how well it describes the fall of man to his primal state.
3,Like Many Classics in these days.,"In his day, Joseph Conrad had a remarkable way of discribing a scene, very pognant. But as I finished reading Heart of Darkness, it reminded me of the original King Kong movie with Fay Wray. It was scary...in its day."
5,Don't dive in...,This is one of the greatest novels ever written. The problem is it is so layered that it is hard to just pick up and read. I strongly suggest purchasingCliffsNotes on Conrad's Heart of Darkness & The Secret Sharerto assist you in figuring out the depth of this great novel. Read them both together and I am sure you will come away with a better reading experience and appreciation for this masterpiece.
4,Short but Long,"The book is actually short compared to many other books of similar difficulty, yet requires more time to read than one might expect. There are many metaphors and deeper meanings you need to think about to totally understand the book. When reading it, I also found that a large dictionary can be quite useful, because Conrad has an extensively large vocabulary. I would rate it a 5, but this book was too difficult to read through smoothly."
3,Good For Answering Questions About Imperialism.,A very eye-opening book for those looking to see what the Congo was like in the age off mass European dominance and African colonization. Insightful and interesting. This is rich in metaphor and allows the reader to see the pros and cons to living in such a time.
3,Highlights imperialism's horrors,"Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad has been on my list of ""books to read"" for over a year; finally, I'm able to cross it off!The novel details one man's travels into the heart of Africa (or, the heart of darkness) during the late nineteenth century when imperialism flourished. There, he observes the corruptibility of man's nature, heart, and mind. This portrayal did not shock me as I would have expected, but that is most likely because I knew the story and imperialism's effects.Extremely long paragraphs and a continuous retrospective made this book difficult to read for long periods of time. However, having gotten through it, I can confidently say that it was worth the time spent."
3,About book,Would not recommend reading this book. Horrible. Couldn't understand it at all. Considering it was electronically of course I received it in a timely fashion.
1,Do yourself a favor---get a better edition,"Love the novel, but hate this edition. The critical essays in the back are of the worst sort--the ""Reader-Response"" essay is filled with so much opaque, sludge-like prose so as to make it virtually unreadable, and the feminist (!) criticism of the book is abosolutely ridiculous, facile, and well...just plain bad. The rest of the essays are of the same low-caliber. Read the novel by all means, but do yourself a favor and get a different edition."
1,I wish 1 star weren't the minimum,"Second worst book I've ever read, second only to ""Falling Leaves,"" or ""Chinese Cinderella"" as it was later reprinted, because its target audience isn't intelligent enough to look into a book without a flashy title. This book was written by someone on drugs. It is poorly thought out, has characters that can't be understood and make no sense, and overall is a slap in the face of traditional literature. Please avoid; it's not worth the $0.00 it costs."
1,heart of darkness,there goes 5 hours of my life i will never get backwhat a waste of time who the hech was kuntz anyway
3,Difficult Reading,The book was difficult to follow based on today's prose. The arthur wrote in a style that was more in fashion during that period. The book was full of thought provoking conditions and is worth reading but do not expect a book you will not want to put down.
1,A testament.,This novel is a testament to the fact that Joseph Conrad's first language was not english. Easy to comprehend and inordinately difficult to read. It's emphasis on visual clarity means that you spend so much time imaging dark gloomy and oppresive that the story (what little there is) is quickly subsumed by the over descrpitive nature of Conrad's descent into the darkness of the human soul.
5,Twisted under the surface,"Conrad's mastery of the English language lend the book a lyrical and rich quality. On cursory reading, the narrative appears naturalistic, almost normal, but below that surface lie many layers, each difficult to define, and each impossible to separate from the natural flow of the text. It is a metaphysical treatise on good and evil, a sharp damnation of the opportunism and speculation of colonialism, a brilliant rendering of impenetrable Africa, a picaresque, and a treasure map which points out the region of the heart, if not the exact spot, in which human compassion can be buried and hidden forever"
2,I just didn't get it,"I suppose this book was good. Every literary person seems to think so. I like the wasy Conrad puts some of his sentences together. But the rest of it was boring and too cryptic for my tastes. This like reading The book of the new sun with not even a decipherable adventure story within its pages. Yuck, is all I can say. Maybe when I'm older I'll try again. But probably not."
1,ouch....,"Well, I had to read this book four years ago for my grade 13 english class. I thought it couldn't be that bad since it's not too long. Hmm. How wrong I was. Every paragraph and every page was an effort. And not one of those efforts that pays off in the end. I don't know how I made it through and anyone I talked to that liked it could only regurgitate what the critics had said. ""The Horror"" was finding out that I had to read it in my first year of university too...."
1,Boring but good for insomnia.,Not really about anything. Goes on and on. Then stops. Apparently I have to write ten more words so here they are.
3,Diminishing rewards,"This is the first book I have read of Joseph Conrad. ""The Heart of Darkness"" has a beautiful start, and Conrad is a true master of words. But around the half way point the plot begins to fizzle. Conrad goes off on a tangent that differs from the main story. Then pursues a reverence for a character, Kurtz, that is unsupported. The ending is a eulogy for Kurtz, who was barely in the story. Perhaps there are historical references of the time that I am unaware of that would support the story, but standing alone it is only half a book. I am looking forward to reading more of Joseph Conrad however. His poetic pros are amazing, inspiring."
3,Too much Genius...For me,"Joseph Conrad is brilliant, but he is too self-indulgent. Honestly, I don't think for the amount description we have to wade through that the ""insights"" are worth it. Great works of art are far more efficient at communicating their insights."
2,Heart of Disappointment,"Heart of Darkness is one of those books everyone tells you to read before you die. After finally sitting down to read it, I couldn't help but ask ""Why?"" Heart of Darkness is supposed to be about a man confronted by the darkness of the human soul, yet the closest we get to this is the villain moaning ""the horror"" repeatedly. Speaking of villains, throughout the novel the reader is informed that Kurtz, the ivory poacher and main villain, might have finally slipped off the deep end and is committing atrocities against the natives. Whether this is true or not is left unanswered since once the main character finally confronts Kurtz the story pretty much ends. This is the biggest disappointment of HoD: that it is never really clear what exactly is happening. It is a big confused mess and wastes the subject matter's vast potential."
1,Nightmare!,"Yes, there is an important point to this novel, but you have to dig so deep in order to find it. It is obvious that Conrad was afraid to really speak his mind because of the controversy and instead he walks a fine line between imperialism and it's victims. Instead he wrote a colections of useless words which are nothing more than giberish. This book had potential."
1,I hated this book! I thought it was really hard to read.,It started as marlow went down the congo river and he ran into people and met kurtz's and that is about all I cauoght on to. I hated this book!!!!!
1,MISUNDERSTANDING,"Joseph Conrad showed in this book that he never understood much about human nature. He portrays the horror as if it was awakened or caused by the circumstances. If you wish to read a real book, please read ""Nausea"" by J.P. Sartre also available from Amazon."
3,Fair Listening,"I agree with the ""2-star"" reviewer: This reader's supercilious tone annoyed me from the start and though I'm the patient sort, Mr. Case's voice never enveloped me in this moody, brooding story. I imagined Marlow recounting his tale from the comfy confines of a deep leather chair at his favorite club rather than while seated cross-legged on the hard deck of an anchored ""yawl"" on a river in the middle of the night. What should have been spooky and ghost-story like came out almost shrill and abit grating to my ear. If you must listen to ""Darkness"" then this version will suffice but before buying I'd recommend checking out your public library first for a different edition."
5,The only way to read Heart of Darkness,"Here is a book that combines the complete text of Conrad's novel with a biographical and historical introduction and five, excellent essays of contemporary criticism. The essays include a variety of approaches: psychoanalytical by Frederick Karl, reader-response by Adena Rosmarin, feminist by Johanna Smith, deconstruction by J. Hillis Miller, and new historicism by Brook Thomas. Each essay is preceeded by a description of the approach and followed by a concise bibliography of recommended sources that use the critical method. There is also an excellent glossary of critical and theoretical terms."
4,A classic that must be revisited every once in a while as a reminder,"Apocalypse Now doesn't do justice to this story. You need to actually lose yourself amidst the pages to discover the true darkness humanity possesses. With each page, you'll be drawn further and further into the jungle of emotions, where you'll try to keep away from the tentacles of nausea and disgust as you traverse the primordial struggle for survival. Sure, you'll fight the mosquitoes and humidity of ethics, but in the end you will succumb to what Joseph Conrad refers to as the dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths and germs of empires.-by Simon Cleveland"
3,hard to understand.,"OK. To start off I'm Polish. And I know this guy was Polish, so it would have been politically correct of me to say how much I loved this book, but unfortunately I can't say that. It just wasn't for me."
2,i hated this book,i did not understand this book until my college teacher explained it i was reviewing it for my childs ap class.
3,Not Bad But Too Deep for Me,"For me, this was not a very interesting story. I realize there is a lot of symbolism behind Conrad's writings, but perhaps I am not 'bright' enough to fully appreciate them. There is a lot of representation of the natural darkness of man's morality- but beyond this I didn't pick up too much. I struggled reading the book- it actually took me almost a year to finish it, even though it is quite short. Despite its short length- the chapters are painfully long, and I found myself desiring some kind of break.The introduction to the signet classic version (written by Albert Guerard) is an excellent aide to the book, and helped me see the different poionts of view regarding the book and it also helped me see why this book is so highly esteemed. Although I found the reading of this book slow and at times torturous, I believe Conrad has a correct (yet dark) view of human nature. Compared to Conrad's Secret Sharer, this book is much better."
4,EMC,"Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness is, as the title implies, a journey into the darkest, most horrific regions of the human heart and soul. In the book, we see an example of exactly what a world of pain and chaos can do to not just one man's mind, but the minds of everyone that he comes in contact with. While we follow our hero, Marlowe, towards the climactic encounter with the enigmatic Mr. Kurtz, we get a powerful and intimate look into Africa during it's colonization and the horrors that were committed in the hunt for ivory. This book is a classic, and should be regarded as such by anyone that reads it."
2,I guess I'm too stupid . . .,". . . to ""get it"" about this novel. This is not an entertaining read.On the surface it's about a merchant steamship journey up a river into very primitive Africa. Deeper, it has to do with the unseen, unreachable depths behind the exposed jungle's edge (ah, the ""heart of darkness""). There are also some people studies (the station manager who's longevity is owed to that he never gets sick and dies, the mysterious Mr. Kurtz dealing for ivory in the wilderness reaches . . . who dies by the way).Unfortunately, author Conrad's prose and process is so abstract that it was like trying to read something written by a drunk. Very drunk. The careless pronouns made it hard to figure out the current subject of interest. The willy-nilly jumping from the ship's deck to the inside of someone's head was confusing and mentally dizzying.I'm not anti-Conrad. I loved the Secret Sharer. I really disliked Heart of Darkness."
2,Heart Of Darkness Review,"I think my biggest problem with it was that I was unable to relate. I don't have any experience that is similar. There were no female characters that were in more than a couple of paragraphs. Also, I didn't really care for Conrad's writing style. It was also sometimes confusing on who was talking, between the main character, who opened the novel, and Marlow, who was telling the story."
3,I wanted to rip this book to pieces!,"Ok, so I usually give books a chance, even if they are a class assignment but this book just made me aggravated. I mean it seems to enforce the strategy of using 40 words when 1 will do and just goes on and on and on. I mean I know that this book is classic and Conrad is an acquired taste but I just couldn't stand having to get through it. The only reason I was able to finish it at all was because I had the flu and was half delirious so I wasn't paying attention to what I was reading anyways (although this was only for the last 50 pages of it and my edition had like 180 pages). Anyways, I understand this is supposed to be a classic. It just isn't my taste."
4,a heart of darkness lives within each of us,"The book Heart of Darkness, written by Joseph Conrad is worth at least 4 stars, maybe even 4 1/2. Conrad's native language was Polish, but this book was written in english. This would make you think that it is confusing and hard to understand. This book is hard to understand, but people tend to think so for all the wrong reasons. This book is only 76 pages in length, but it is astonishing how much detail is crammed into those pages. In order to understand this book you must be willing to read it for months and go back to previous paragraphs to understand why things happened the way they did.Researching information about Conrad's life would also help in reading this book. Alot of people around his in his life died of various diseases. In this book he inflicts disease on Kurtz, who was given the disease because of having so much power and so little restraint. The heart of darkness represents the jungle, having no mercy toward human life."
2,Conrad should have done better,This book totally disillusions readers. Conrad makes it seem as though the atrocities which take place in this colony do so in all. This assumption which many readers get is false. For this reason I think Conrad should have made it clear that the Belgian Congo was an extreme condition.
3,"Great depth, average execution","Conrad is a master of his art, yet Heart of Darkness' experiment in the 1st/3rd person perspective makes for an irritatingly slow and detailed read. Notwithstanding the thematic depth of the novel, it could be helped along by a brisker pace and less environmental rhetoric."
1,Achebe is right!!,"Everything Achebe says about this book is absolutely correct. This book well reveals the ludicrous, insane nature of European stereotypes about Africa and Africans. These stereotypes still persist in the minds of many. Read this book...then read Achebe's Things Fall Apart...then read Conde's Segou...."
1,Not worth it and here's why....,"It seems to me that some people take way too much meaning out of certain books. To me, books should be like music. The message should be in the words, not by deciphering ""now what was the meaning of the tattered book in the hut?"" Many praise this book as literary genius, but I think it was no more than a boring story (hard to get through it's measly page number). If you want the story told in a good way, rent Apocalypse Now; it's based (albeit more loosely) on the book."
3,Total eclipse of the Heart,"Is it wrong to want more? I just wanted an ending equivalent to Apocolypse Now. I wanted a more climactic ending. I wanted some passion--yes, perhaps a raunchy sex scene with Kurtz's girlfriend at the end. I even wanted to see Kurtz' head on a stick. Am I asking too much? I think not. Even so, there's something to be said for a novella that inspired Apocolypse Now. Indeed Apocolypse Now at least tried to remain somewhat faithful to the storyline of Heart of Darkness. I read it to see just how faithful. It's a tight little novel. Just that Apocolypse Now eclipses Heart of Darkness so completely, Heart of Darkness is left...in the dark."
1,never read this book,This book makes no sence. If you can understand this book than you are a genus. I have to read this book for school and I don't understand 1 single page of this book. If someone out there understands this book please tell me or let me know.
1,Make it stop!,"I have to read Heart of Darkness for English (I'm in Yr 11). I am currently about one-fifth of the way through, and was happy when I saw the length of the book (around 100 pages, it should be easy, right?) Also, having previously seen Apocolypse Now (an okay movie, if a tad long - based on Heart of Darkness) I thought it shouldn't be to hard to read the book.However, boy, was I wrong. It is written in an annoyingly complex language, although at times the descriptions are rather hazy, leaving an uneven feel to the book. I am finding myself having to constantly re-read many paragraphs just to find out what Conrad was even talking about.In fact, it is getting so painful, I now know the meaning of torture. I'm sure they would use this in police interrigations if it were'nt for the fact that it is just as painful for the reader as it is to the poor soul who would have to suffer from hearing it read aloud.I just want it to end. Please, make it stop."
2,"I really didn't get into the story because of the reader. It was so robotic, the intonation and pronunciation of words was bad.",I stated my feelings above. An audio book should be pleasing to theears to hear so this bad audio didn't make me want to listen to the book.
3,Kind of a downer,I'm on a midi ion to read some of these older books. This one came highly recommended. I must have missed some of the deeper meaning because it just didn't do that much for me.
5,thin classic,"A very slight book, it shouldn't intimidate the early teen from reading some good literature. My 12 yo read it on the plane home. (wull, his ipod batteries died, somehow. . . .:)"
3,Good,This book was for school and was a happy medium to read. Interesting enough to keep reading the book but didn't love it.
4,A Mysterious Read,"Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness reveals the tale of a grueling manhunt for a rebel ivory hunter, Colonel Kurtz. Marlow, the man assigned to retrieve him, shares his adventures through the jungle and the hardships he faced in his quest to meet the man that everyone is talking about. His heartfelt journey uncovers just how savage man can get. A must for those who love the thrill of the hunt."
3,spiritual guide...,"We are brought into the book in the middle of the Thames river, who the hell knows what's going on until you reach page 20?!What Conrad has done, is gone into a spiritual search for himself (depicted through Marlow).Civilisation is the body that houses our souls. Civilisation is that set of rules, norms and ethics that society shoves into our diaphragms with huge force.Who am I? Am I a number in society, or what?This is the ever present question that Conrad asked, and through leaving civilisation he left the jail of society. He went into the 'wilderness' to discover the molecules of the soul.Basically, you need to leave your inhabitions and enter into the barbarous being that you are."
4,Marvelous,I read this book because it was on the Modern Library's list of the 100 best books. It is certainly a book that deserved to be there. This phychological character study is a book that no serious reader should miss.
5,An INCREDIBLE novel,"This is the most amazing novel. Conrad is a genius of character and symbolism. I didn't look forward to having to read this book, but I'll never regret having read it. At first I had trouble understanding the plot, but I bought the CliffsNotes for it, and that helped. It is such a complex novel, I know I'll read it again and again. It is definitely not Sunday afternoon during-commercial-breaks type of reading, but if you want to read a book that makes you think about humans in a totally new way, then this is the book for you."
5,The Bomb,"This book is excellent. Conrad is a master of metaphor, and Kurtz is very scary. Read this then watch Apocalypse Now. It is really interesting."
4,Cruelty of the Congo,"Joseph Conrad's novel, Heart of Darkness is a sad story of the reality of the Congo in Africa. The characters, such as the natives, the cannibals, truly touch your heart. Marlowe, the main character of this novel, is confronted with the real creator of this slavery and gets to see what the real Heart of Darkness looks like."
3,The Horror! The Horror! It's really not that bad,"When I first started reading this book, It was all just words. As a high school senior, it was a little too difficult to understand, but after many class discussions ans ""socratic seminars"" I really started to understand it. This book is definately not my most favorite, but it's also not my least favorite either. I won't reveal the ending, but it is a really strong ending. ""The Horror! The Horror!"" are the last words spoken of Kurtz, and even though it's the end of the novel, it still leaves the reader wondering about it."
3,Heart Of darkness,"After reading this book, I was sort of disappointed. I guess I was expecying a bit more action, rather than so much detail. Some people like the idea of detailing and description. To me this book has too much description, and the paragraphs seem to just go on and on. I often had to go back to read the paragraph or page again just to understand it. After watching Apocalypse now, I actually understood the book version a whole lot better. The main character still narrates the story but it helped me to have a visual to understand what was going on. This book is not terrible but the book was difficult for me to read and understand completely."
2,Where's the Harp?,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, but I never figured out what the ""Harp"" in the title means. Plus, I didn't lose any weight. I recommend ""The South Beach Diet."""
1,Very boring book!,This was a very hard book to read unless you had a lot of caffeine. The author uses so many descriptive phrases it is hard to follow. This is not a book you would willingly read it has to be forced upon you.
1,This book is deadly.,"DEADLY boring. I would have given it zero stars, but I guess one star is as low as you can go."
4,"Good, but difficult","If I could give one piece of advice to those about to tackle Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness,"" it would be to get a version with lots of background information, literary criticisms, and the like.The best way to read it is to read it once through (in my version, this was a short, but very dense 115 pages), then read all the extra stuff, then read it again. Unless you're a certified genius with extensive literary and historical knowledge, you're going to be lost without all the outside information.That said, this is a very affecting book. It's really all the ambiguities and the frustrating anticlimax that make you think. Thinking is good, and people should do it more often."
2,We all know by now Conrad had a large vocabulary....,This certainly wasn't the worst book that I have ever read but I did not find it enjoyable. I did enjoy Conrad's eccentric use of verbatim but felt like he went overboard in some parts. Being wordy is ok as long as you don't go beyond the line of a reader's attention span. I felt like I was losing the plot and the meaning in his existential descriptions. I would only recommend this novella for those with long attention spans and can sift through vast expanses of words and come out with a general meaning.
2,Heart of Darkness is Right,"As I began reading this book, I felt a little disturbed. The use of details that Conrad uses in the story are incredible. As Marlow talks to his shipmates in the story, the details he uses are intense. As he talks of his trip up the river, his friends on the ship tend not to be paying attention to him. This contributes to the difficulty of reading this book. Conrad had Marlow telling his story, and at the same time he switches back and forth from that to Marlow talking to his friends in the present. This makes the story very confusing. Conrad successfully showed how the colonization and imperialism was selfish and the colonizers were only tried to make a profit by obtaining ivory. The story itself wasnt too bad. It had a good plot and I liked the ending. It wrapped up a little fast I thought, but overall it was a good ending. If you liked the movie, Apocollapse Now, you will definitely enjoy this book, since the movie is based on this book."
1,OH MY GOD THIS BOOK WAS BORING,"It seems that all of the previous reviews that gave bad ratings were from students whom were forced to read this horrible novel. The narration of Marlow was unrealistic and dreadfully boring. Seriously: it's a seaman telling a story off the top of his mind, yet he incorporates extreme detail and excessive figurative language that just bogs you down. Oh, so detail is great, but how great is it if you have to analyze each individual word just to find some point in this nonsense. I think young students would benefit from the theme of this story (not that I found one), but the style of presenting it just makes you want to burn this book (not a bad idea, it's only $1.00! ). A very well written novel? Well, Conrad surely knows how to make a student's learning experience miserable. Five stars for boredom. One star for everything else."
1,Different Price,The price on the book says 1.50... The text is too small and it may be better to pay a little more so you don't need a magnifying glass. Rip Off
2,I must be missing something,"I really wanted to like this book - honestly. I finished it this morning on the train while riding into work and after I was done I closed it, put it in my bag, and it was almost immediately gone from my conscience. I can't quite pinpoint what it is about the book that bothered me. How something so densely written can be so bland is beyond me. Conrad started to get my attention a few times, he really did. For instance, I was quite happy when the natives started shooting arrows at the boat. Not that I'm some simpleton that needs action and gore to be happy - that's not it at all. There was another reader that implied Conrad didn't speak his mind entirely - I think that's part of what bothered me. He'd start to to get to a point, and then lose it. I wanted to like this book because I love classics, but this did absolutely nothing for me. And if I had seen the word ""gloom"" or a variation of it one more time, I would have died by spontaneous combustion."
5,One of the Great novels of all time,One of the must reads in literature. Probably my favorite novel ever written. The short length is decieving. It is not a novel to be blown through without thought. The themes of this novel resonate more in our day and age than ever before. Literary greatness.
3,consciousness awakening,"Very complex and thought provoking, quite powerful and poignant. Excellent uses of symbols and motifs. I appreciate the value and importance of this book (probably 4 stars for this) and I definitely think everybody shoud read it , but I can't say I enjoyed reading it."
2,Grueling - The horror! the horror!,"I can only thank God this novel was short. Reading it was a grueling process, not because of syntax errors or pretentious wording, but because it was so dull and dry. It seemed to drone on and on in the same monotone voice with no defined direction. I would not read this book for enjoyment, if you are to read it, do it because for some reason it is a classic and there are numerous allusions to the book in popular culture and modern literature. To pick the ""best"" part of the book, Conrad did do a good job on the themes of the unknown and the dark depths of human nature. The end was interesting, but it did not plunge me into an analysis of the book or any sort of emotional connection to my life."
1,Written in a confusing manner,Some people say that because this was and old book that we must forgive the way it was written. Truth is that I read many others classics from that era and they were all written less difulcult than this book.
3,"Heavy on the Symbolism, aren't we?","I didn't enjoy it. In fact, I hated it. But I was reading it for class, and so I finished it. It was ponderous.All in all, this, to me at least, is not a book you read for enjoyment. It is something you read because someone tells you that you have to.Despite the lack of fun-ness, however, I can recognize geniuses of style. And Conrad is. The book a wonder of controlled words. There isn't a wasted one in the bunch. The themes are still themes which have some bearing on human life today. It's thick with symbolism. If you're looking for a 'thick' read, this one will do you."
2,liked The Secret Sharer more,"I really enjoyed the psychological aspects of the ""Secret Sharer."" The inner-thoughts provoked by the Captain's doppleganger, Leggatt, serve to make the story a true masterpiece. Heart of Darkness is no light reading, yet can is interesting in that it is a quasi-mystery."
5,gripping,"Follow the search for the renegade Kurtz into the darkness of primeval forests...and learn about the darkness at the heart of us all. An eloquent depiction of the alternation between culture and ""exterminate all the brutes"" in the same breast."
5,"Challenging, but rewarding book.","""Heart of Darkness"" is an excellent book! In order to completely grasp the ideas and theme Joseph Conrad had in mind when writing this book, one must adamantly focus his full attention unto the text. The text may be difficult during some portions of the book, but the final impression one recieves at the end is well worth the struggle!"
2,Ehhh???,"I am glad to see others didn't care for this either. I tried Lord Jim and quit a few pages in...and this was no better, although I finished...I hope the next few books on the list are better"
2,the novel show us the reality of Europeans,"realy i d'ont like this novela ,because it is very complex ,it needs a lot of atention .It shows us the primitive aspect of man ."
2,what annotations?,I ordered this version instead of the free Kindle e-book version because it's the 'annotated.' There aren't any annotations. There's a Conrad biography that certainly isn't worth $2.99.
5,One of the best short books ever,"I had no idea of even the background for Heart of Darkness, let alone the plotline, before I read it. What I discovered was a wonderfully intricate description of one man's venture through the jungles of the Belgian Congo and the psychological depths of his own mind. Highly reccomended, although it is best to read with an open mind, many ideas introduced early in the novel aren't explained until the very end."
3,Good but not Leslie Jordan's best work...,"I think this was supposed to be autobiographical but it was very hard to follow. It had it's funny moments and it's poignant moments and if you are a fan of his, it is probably worth watching. It is mostly a slice of life thing, though, so do not expect any redemption or resolution."
4,Candid camp,"A brave movie about the only two things which should matter--acceptance and faith. Yet these are lost early in life crowded out by junk--the junk of fractured families, the junk of sexuality, the junk of junk. The attempt at reclamation, of course, is farcical as Mardi-Gras carnies try for salvation from their wrecked temples of promiscuity and addiction and cruelty."
3,Shipping gone wrong,Shipping was really fast. When I open the box I first seen that it wasn't the same as the picture. They sent Philips 278622 bulb. Given that it's a $25 value I didn't care; however looking a the bulb a bit more I found a hair line crack in it. I have order an other one and will be senting the Philips 278622 back. Just hope it goes better this time.
5,Like and use over and over,"Use these for small touch up and small area paint jobs. They are very good, disposable, minimal mess, fast and easy. I have used them repeatedly and glad to have discovered them."
2,crap,"Flimsy. Also, when i ordered this i selected to order additional rollers. they didnt fit. im sure theres something else on the market worth the money that does the job."
4,it's my party...,"Classic Gore collection. It's my party and I listened 'cuz I need to! fine sonics. ADD or AAD pure, clean sound."
3,goody hair clips,Received product and not as pictured. Packaging was completely different. The clips in the picture look larger and mine did not come with the red clips. Kinda disappointing as I mostly wanted the red ones. But for $5 not a bad price and I will still use them.
3,get to know individuals from sarajevo to palestine,"this documentary isn't a complete academic overview of minorities in the lands between sarajevo and palestine, but rather a visit with various individuals (none of them politicians) in bosnia, kosovo, macedonia, albania, turkey, syria, lebanon and palestine. with no knowledge of the history of these places a viewer could feel lost, but perhaps listening to these people may be an invitation for further study. what criteria was used for choosing whom to film is not clear, but ""extremists"" advocating revenge are not presented. at over two hours this dvd is generously unhurried and doesn't stamp out these peoples' individuality."
5,"Even if u arent an anime fan, u have to see this movie","I saw this on Cartoon network the past week and i was very impressed. The animation was beautiful. The story was short and sweet but had a great impact at the end. The point is if u can find a good deal on this movie u need to see it, even if it is only one episode."
5,"Stop the horns, but bring on the battle!!!","In my opinion, the mix of CG & anime make for one of the best anime videos Ive ever seen. Im a fan of all anime, and have a wide nackground, and although the series is way too short and the battle music needs to drift away from that cheery horn, BS6 is recommended to anyone who likes a good plot and a lot of action. What is with the music, though? You dont have an epic battle scene filled with ragin waters, exploding subs, and deadly missles, while a squeaky horn is playing in the background. The characers are likeable, especially Tetsu Hayami (Im not totally confident on the spelling). I tend to like the quiet, mysterious guys who have a bad temper. Basically, i recommend this anime to anyone and everyone!!!"
4,"Fantastic, but too short!","Because of its extensive use of CGI, I had low expectations of this title. Boy, was I surprised! This is pure eye candy. I find most CGI anime released lately to be visually repugnant, but the CGI is extremely well done here and it melds with the cel animation flawlessly. My only gripe is the running time. Only one 30 minute episode on each DVD! I never buy such short videos, but Blue Sub No. 6 came so highly recommended that I decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did."
2,Marketing Sleaze,"I absolutely loved this anime when I saw it, but I cannot and will not give my approval to a simple and sleazy marketing ploy. There are 4 episodes in all, each 30 minutes long. They took the path of the greedy and put 1 episode on each tape or dvd. Personally, I couldnt care less how they market tapes, but one of dvd's strongest points was media size. Even with all the whiz-bang animation and video quality (which is quite good), I dont doubt for a second they could fit all 4 episodes onto 1 disc. They coudlve made it a ""flipper"" or put it onto 2 discs if they felt image quality would be compromised. It just makes me sick that they would do this. Oh yeah, fyi, the music is some of the worst in the not-too-stellar history of anime music. Overall, cool story, great use of cell/cgi animation, horrible marketing, horrible music. A pass, unless its in the bargin bin."
2,Ummm WHAT?!?,"Ok. So I loved this show. But now here's the thing why it's 2 stars. Why didn't they release this in the FIRST place!?!? hehe geez.. Instead of me paying $16-20/disc for those 4 episodes. SO.. I could have saved [money] by getting this version they didn't release until months later?Well besides my rant of getting jipped on the pricing, the entire story line is very cool. The combination of 3D modelled animation and hand drawn is very awesome. I like this new Era that Anime is coming into. They're doing more on the computer and looks much cooler than it ever could hand drawn. I suggest if anyone's an Anime and 3D graphics addict, they pick this flic up (and save a buck or two on collect calls, lol!) . It's a must for any Anime collection."
2,Great animation,"This anime has awesome animation. The best computer graphic animation I have seen. Yet, the story line is confusing and you have to really pay attention to this anime. If you like anime just for the awesome animation you can get this but...it's plot is nothing special."
3,"Good series, poor editing","I love this series. I rented each dvd individually at my local store and nearly cried when the Musuca died 3/4 of the way through the series. It is an excellent scene that I believe is badly marred due to the editing done for television. I'm a little curious why an unedited ""movie"" version hasn't come out. Great series and well worth the purchase. If you're just curious about the show or just want some anime to satisfy those cravings, pick up this edited version of the show. But if you really care about getting the full effect, pass on it because you might be upset"
5,The best anime in a long while!,The future is now found in the waters of a flooded globe.whats left of the world bands together forming an underwater sub-base retaliating against zorndyke's bad guys.simply put but you must watch it to understand the submarines no.6 struggle.wonderfully layed in animation and combined CGI effects.
4,Water is fun..So are Submarines :D,This was pretty good. The story needs some deveopment but other than that..it was sweet. Charaters are cool and the music is AWESOME! Wicked....
2,only good for killing time...,"I wouldn't normally feel compelled to write a bad review for something, especially since every one is entitled to their own opinion, but I was exxtremely disappointed with this series. I bought this VHS because its trailer on several Cowboy Bebop sessions had caught my interest.The artwork wasn't bad - in fact, the CG work was excellent, but the characters themselves were poorly drawn. The storyline was trite, the voices (particularly dubbed) were TERRIBLE, and the lead female character was nothing short of annoying.Whether or not you'll like this series depends on what you're looking for. If you like mecha, action and a story that moves quickly- then go for it.But, if you are looking for something with s better story and better direction, I suggest something more like Cowboy Bebop or Utena."
2,Blue had the blues,"I saw the commercials for this on Cartoon Network, and I was hooked-I had my Tivo record all the episodes. The beginning was slow going, and I waited for it to get better. And waited, and waited... I don't think the characters were well-developed at all; the only characters that held my interest were the submarine itself and the fish-people, specifically the girl that saved our hero. The ending left much to be desired, since it explained even less than the ""beginning"" did. I have to admit, the graphics were excellent, which is the only redeeming thing about this series. I would recommend almost any other anime series for an ""introduction"" series, or I might bore the Newbie to death."
3,Mediocre,"The animation was good, the bad guys were unique, but that was it. The characters are a little too basic for my taste and the only thing truly interesting is the music that holds this piece together.The music is interesting, but still doesn't fit into some scenes (Jazz will be played in exotic fight scenes) but I will give the film props for having different ideas - the end of the world, the doctor at the end with no heart, etc. -Joeyfro.rated 13 up: violence and some nudity"
2,Eye candy...but nothing more.,"Perhaps the rest of the reviewers are used to the animation from Steamboat Willy, but as far as I'm concerned, the semi-decent animation doesn't make up for the lack of character and plot developement. I've seen much better CGI animation than this in many computer games. I had expected something far more impressive. Considering that only one episode is included on each DVD, it is a complete waste of money. Blue Submarine is not worth all of the hype that it is given by reviewers. If you want your money's worth of Anime, get something else."
2,Too Short for the Price,"This DVD, although visually impressive isn't worth the price for only 30 min of animation. It was an interesting blend of computer generated scenes along with traditional animation, but there were sections that just didn't mesh all that well. It sets the stage for the rest of the series, but doesn't cover enough plot to make me want to buy the second volume."
4,Wowowowow,"Tres incredible! Just watched this on the Cartoon Network (one of the world's greatest channels), and thoroughly loved it. It was so non-Western as far as plot and characters go, and truly moving. The animation blows the mind, and even the CGI is well done. The plot is great, but it is the characters themselves that are the keepers (as in any truly great anime--Gundam Wing, anyone?). Especially Hayami. Oi, kawai. He made me think of what would happen if Heero never got together with Relena. The whole series itself takes a piece of 'Waterworld,' uses it correctly, and mixes it with the fabulous H.G. Wells book 'The Island of Dr. Moreau' in an intoxicating piece of animated art. Again, just, 'Wow.'"
4,Works well - but the plow angle lock is dodgy,"When plowing, you sometimes hit stuff despite being careful. The release/locking handle that allows the blade angle to be changed takes the brunt of it and stops locking."
5,An essential album for every collection.,"Oscar Peterson + George Gershwin. What a combination! Peterson and his veteran trio sound brilliant on this gorgeous disc. My wife, a recent jazz fan, loves this disc. It has a bouyant, ebulient, feel to it while simultaneously being an essential after hours recording. I have to give props to bassist Ray Brown who just kicks a$$ here. Peterson often sounds restrained here, which is a bit different, yet he is no less inspired or fiery. As for the songs, well, its Gershwin. What more do you need to know?Essential."
1,Big Love 1st season,This was not the entire first season and I was very disappointed ..I was expecting the entire first season so this was not what the owner claimed at all..
1,Very Disappointed,Never got my movie from the seller. I am still waiting. They have taken my money and not gotten my movie
1,Raymond Benson should never write again,"Raymond Benson is ruining the James Bond series. Each novel has gotten consistently worse. In this novel, Benson ruins the relationship between Bond and Draco, in a twist that should only be in movies. Which brings me to the point that Benson writes his novels like a movie. Although highly imaginative, not traditional Bond fare. He also constantly refers back to old Bond novels, as if he can't think of his own words for particular pieces of a novel. If anyone is planning to buy this, I urge you not to and instead buy a novel by Fleming from a used bookstore."
2,Is 007's time up?,"A Bond book, like the films, is a journey where you know the destination but you want to enjoy the ride. Having read other reviews I am a little surprised to find my views are in conflict with many of them. I love Bond films and have enjoyed most of the books to date, however, this one felt...wrong.Bond only makes intermittent appearences for the first third of the book and when he does, it does not feel like Bond. I mean, he falls in love at first sight for goodness sake! The way Draco appears from the past and how their relationship evolves was clumsy and not how we want to see a character from the past dealt with.Okay there is action and a few gadgets but the real test is that if it was not a 007 branded book and was just a thriller it would be rather run of the mill. We fans deserve a little better."
5,Benson hits his mark,"""Never Dream of Dying"" is probably one of the better Bond books out there. While nothing can quite match Flemings ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", Never Dream of Dying comes extremely close. Benson does not bombard you with useless knowledge of casino games and gagets that some authors do (ie: Tom Clancy). Instead, what Benson does with this book is keep you turning the pages with his seamless transitions between scenes. The villains are believable and their motive is as well. Benson also brings in a couple of names from the past. I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of 007."
1,The NERVE!!!,"OK, maybe that was a bit strong. But I'm a novelist too, and I personally would hate my characters being mucked about with after I was dead. Mathis and Marc-Ange Draco weren't his characters to begin with, and now he's made it so that if anyone else ever writes Bond novels, they cannot be used (unless Mathis became a pity figure, which would be horrible and not at all useful to the writer or fun to the reader). Benson's crime group and its leader are poor retreads of Blofeld and SPECTRE, too. All I see in this book is a writer cobbling together Fleming's old ideas to make money."
2,Benson's worst effort yet,"This latest Bond offering didn't capture my imagination like the other. This book completes the Union trilogy, but the Union mystique kind of just fizzles out. The Union and le Gerant seemed much less evil in this offering. Bond spends the book chasing after the Union, but in the previous books, we had more of a sense of his impending doom. The bad guys are all from previous books. The only original bad guy is more of a pawn of the union. Aside from the story, Benson is not a very good writer. Maybe it was more prevalent in this novel that in others, But Benson uses the passive voice in writing sentences. Instead of describing scenes, he tells us with the verb ""was"". I know a lot of authors do this, but Benson does it so much that it sticks out and becomes destracting. A better writer would find a better way to describe things. Benson will never be a great writer, but as his worst effort, this book wasn't that bad."
4,This really is Bond and beyond&#65533;,"007 finally comes face to face with Le Gérant, the blind criminal genius who heads The Union crime syndicate. The meeting does not disappoint. Raymond Benson's writing is stylish and assured. It seems that he has deliberately attempted to push back the boundaries of the conventional Bond novel - the sex scenes are more explicit than any of their predecessors, the torture scenes more graphic. In-jokes sit comfortably alongside brutal violence. Benson's Bond is ruthless and resourceful, which is just the way we like him. Nothing is sacrosanct, and there are plenty of thrills and a few surprises before the end. Highly recommended, but let me give you a word of warning - if you like rats then there is one scene that will probably upset you!"
4,BOND COMEWS FACE TO FACE WITH THE EVIL UNION LEADER,"IT STARTED WITH STOLLEN ARMS IN NICE WHERE A RAID TASK FORCE(GOOD GUYS) WITH BOND AND HIS FRENCH SPY BUDDY RENE MATHIS GOES ALL WRONG KILLING MANY INOSINT PEOPLE. THEN A PRODUCER LEON ESSINGER(BAD GUY) IMPORTS STOLEN GL-20 ON TO HIS MOVIE SET FOR A NEW ACTION MOVIE OF HIS ""PIRITE ISLAND"". AND BOND'S FATHER INLAW MARK-ANGE DRACO(SEEN IN OHMSS STARRING GEORGE LAZENBE) RETURN ONLY TO TRY AND KILL BOND AT THE END. THE MEETING OF A MODLE/ACTRESS TYLYN WHO'S LIFE IS IN DANGER FROM LEON HER DIVORCED HUSBAND. THE MISSING OF MATHIS AT LE GARANT'S HOUSE MONACO. THE FINDING OF MATHIS AND THE BRUTAL EYE TORCHUR BOND ENDURED. THE ESCAPE OF BOND(BECAUSE MATHIS HAS BEEN BLINDED). THE QUICK PLAN TO RESCUE MATHIS. THE RESCUE OF MATHIS AND ELILIMINATION OF MARK-ANGE, LE GARANT A.K.A. OLIVER CESARI. AND THE END OF THE UNION AT LAST!!!"
3,I just don't know,"Well, Benson is known for his Bondian scholarship, and it shows in this book as in all his others. When he first came to the franchise I was impressed by his little 'Fleming' touches - detailed gambling scenes, precisely named gadgets and so on - but after a few books I'm getting a bit bored with it all.I didn't think this was a bad book, just that it wasn't a great book either. Having hit on the Bond formula, Benson seems content to tread water, writing the same style (though thankfully not the same story) over and over again.Is it time for another author to take over the franchise? I think I'd like to see each new Bond book written by a different author, each bringing something of his or her own style to the series. But would that destroy that magical 'Bondness' that we all love? I just don't know."
1,disturbing and not academic,"In the very first paragraph he comments that ""...we do not know when or where the human race originated"".....ummm, we have a pretty good idea, and with genetic research of populations, human migrations are being documented even more accurately. This makes me distrust the writer and not want to keep reading...ALSO in the first paragraph, he refers to the ice age that we are ""still coming out of""?? Is this referring to global warming? How ridiculous that some dusty old historian is treating this book as his means of venting about so-called liberal ideas such as climate change...I was convinced that this book had to be extremely dated, but the last edition was printed in 1995! There is no excuse!"
2,Schmaltz galore,"If you like a large string section in your jazz music, this is the CD for you. It is schmaltzy beyond belief, unabashed even in its inclusion of the theme of The Girl from Ipanema. Charlie Haden is an excellent musician, but this CD was clearly meant for ""the masses"". He's done better."
4,Comfortable,This undergarment helped hold everything in and was very comfortable even when wearing it for several hours. Washed well also.
1,I never recieved this item!,I need to know who to contact about this. I ordered this book in late August and have yet to receive it.
5,Great book!,I could not get enough of this series. Was buying a new one each day. did not want the series to end. When I got to the end I felt as if an old friend had died.
5,Another Oke Hit,"Love Finds a Home is another wonderful story in this series. I read the book and then enjoyed seeing the movie on the Hallmark channel last week. What interesting, clean and wholesome entertainment. It is hard to put any of Janette Oke's books down."
5,Werner Pull-Down Stairway,"Well built, easy to install. Plywood door and reinforced steps make for a stairway that should last as long as the house does!"
1,NEVER AGAIN,"I used the 15"" 3 times when 1/4 of the pixels went out. I contacted the company to no avail. No help, no response, no resolution. I will never buy a Samsung product EVER again and will tell everyone I know. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE- NO- NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I had to give it one star. 0 was not an option."
4,Good Mag,"Its a good magazin.e, and the fact that you can combine the magazines together(infinitely in theory) You can create something almost like an ammo box. Only complaint would be the last bb in the mag wont load, not a problem really. That shows wonderful it is"
5,the Mag,this was a nice item it fit perfectly with the air solf gun i baught it to go with it even snaps on to the magazine that came with the gun it goes to so u just go from one mag to the other that quickly it was a perfect acciser and looked cool with that double mag if you get the double eagle m82 airsolf gun you gotta get a spare mag with it its just goes together like slice bread and butter and its only like 7 bucks and that includes ph get one nuff said
3,low cap.,"Just to let you all know I had an M82, and thought two mags would cut it. It wasn't enough. The mag itself it fine, but a low capacity of 36rds. I would suggest getting 3+ mags. That is the only reason I rated three stars."
3,OK...,"The fake bullets are kinda cool and actually fooled my friend who is a noob to airsoft. Now you might think that 40 rounds is okay, but really it sucks. It depletes in seconds! The only reason I rate this 3 stars is because they stack.- Skylar"
1,FAIL!!,"I checked that this was suppose to be used for a m82 double eagle and when I got the package and i tried to install it into the gun, it did not match. So now I got three useless gun magazines for a m82, and these magazines are for a m85. they are totally different!!!. what a FAIL!!! And I live in costa Rica and it is very expesive to get these kinds of things. pointless to send them back, It would cost me a left nut and the whole package!!! thank you anyway."
4,Sonic Ear,It was easy to use although it is a little clunky meaning not sexy no creatively in design. The head phones and ear buds are really cheap. Sound quality is good but for the price I think they should make it wireless as well.Kind of hard to use for older person who has bad eye sight.
5,Beautiful and challenging,"I'll keep it simple but reiterate that these designs are incredibly beautiful but very time-consuming and difficult to stitch. All the charts are in black and white and most of the pieces require at least thirty or more colors of thread, so if and/or when you decide to purchase or work from this book be sure that you're willing to devote a lot of time and effort to the projects to do them justice fully. If you're willing to put in the effort, you will be wonderfully rewarded. This is truly the best set of patterns that I own."
5,Ride The Rails In The Most Beautiful Land Ever Created!,I Found The Whole Film Great. This Video Is A Real Treasure For Railfans & Travel Buffs Alike! I Loved the scene where the old man made swiss cheese.
3,Returned defective item and received refund,"Since reviewing this before, a representative of the vendor called me and assured me that they had a procedure for quality control. I guess even the best procedures are subject to glitches. Anyway, I was able to return the item without too much trouble and they refunded the money, so all's well that ends well."
3,BEWARE: this is NOT the real thing!,"This is a great example of Hollywood tampering with a classic. If you're hoping to see the opera ""The Merry Widow,"" please look elsewhere. If you want a fluffpiece with Maurice Chevalier being his usual charming self, you might give this a look -- but the sound is wretched compared to recent productions."
3,Great Movie but Beware of Chinese Subtitles,"This is a great black and white classic. It's one of my favorite musicals. Sadly, I saw no indication that this particular DVD was produced for a Chinese market. IT HAS CHINESE SUBTITLES and these subtitles greatly detracted from my enjoyment of this movie."
5,VILIA AND OTHER DELIGHTS.,"A bankrupt king orders a nobleman to court a wealthy American widow. For lovers of vintage operettas, this 1934 film is one to cherish. The Franz Lehar masterpiece began life in Vienna in 1905 and it was an instant smash hit. It was first brought to the American stage in 1907, made into a lost silent with Alma Reubens and Wallace Reid in 1912, and brought true stardom to the eccentric Mae Murray in Erich Von Stoheim's 1925 version which co-starred John Gilbert. Grace Moore was originally to play Sonia, but she wouldn't accept second billing to Maurice Chevalier. This sparkling, frothy, funny and tuneful movie is a delight, and MacDonald shows a fine flair for comedy: she snaps off her lines with Lombard-like aplomb and expertise. Chevalier was a huge star at the time, and although he was never too crazy about Jeanette, their pairing here is near perfection."
2,Strange gimmicky summit,"1963 recording features a jazz vocal group led by Mimi Perrin singing arrangements by Lalo Schifrin, with Dizzy, Kenny Clarke on drums and the great Bud Powell on piano. Unfortunately, Powell's role is small."
1,Doesn't live up to Delta's reputation,I previously purchased this soap dispenser to go in my bathroom. The first one broke. I ordered a new one from amazon. It came broken. They sent me another. It was broken. I am still waiting on another replacement because amazon would not refund my money. If and when it comes it will be the fourth time I have replaced this model.
2,wall mounted soap holder,"First shipment came cracked. The company was quick to respond to the issue, sent me another shipment the day I made contact, even before they received broken item back. Second item was also chipped at the top. This seems to be a product flaw. The chips did not seem to be that bad, still screwed into the wall mount so I kept the second one. I have had it for at least a year and despite the chips, it is still with us and working. I am sure for the pricier ones are better quality glass but for what I was willing to spend on a soap holder, this was fine."
2,lower quality than shown in picture,"The cats I recieved with the house are not as nice as the ones shown in the picture. The fur is low quality and the paws are not white for the darker animals. The house does not have much structure to it, and collapses. There are no inner compartments for the cats, so nothing holds them in place if pushed entirely inside the house. I feel ripped off because the picture is misleading and the product in the picture is different from the product I received. I will probably send it back."
4,well liked,"My daughter enjoys these cats. The kittens are very soft and have cute faces too. The ""house"" is not exactly what we expected. Its not terrible, just a little hard to get into. There are 5 openings that just drop down into a main room. The openings don't open any larger so adult hands will not fit into the opening, and there isn't any other way for the pets to come in and out. This doesn't seem to bother my daughter, it was just an observation. The ""house"" wasn't crushed like some of the other reviews mentioned. All in all, she likes it, thats really all that matters!"
4,Cute!,This is so dang cute.Wish I would have gotten one for both my girls as they fight over it.Wish it was easier to get the cats in and out.Reccommend to anyone who loves cats or animals.
3,Ok at the very best.,"I bought this product last year to use in long exposure photography during daylight hours. My negative review of this product is not in relation to the amount of light it reduces, it does that just fine and as advertised, but more in the quality of images that can be taken with this filter over the lens. To put it bluntly, it sucks. The clarity goes WAY down and the contrast goes way down.On the plus side, it does fit my 67mm lens perfectly and comes with a nice case with which to carry it in. That said, the nice case it came with is where it will stay from now until the end of time.If you are after taking some nice long exposure shots in the day, look elsewhere. If you are a soccer mom dSLR owner, then this is your ND filter."
2,"small scratch, loss of color","when I received this filter, it had tiny dust particles all over it and a small scratch that did not remove with a soft cloth. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it because I had a shoot the next week that I wanted to use it for. I was shooting a 30 second exposure and getting decent shots. When the light was low enough to maintain the 30 second exposure without this ND filter, I took it off and compared the difference. The difference was unbelievable. When I took the filter off, all of the sudden the saturation and clarity of my photos increased dramatically. I'm now not sure if I need to find an even higher quality filter or just accept this low level of performance."
4,Great for the price,"I'm an amateur photographer and thought this was great for the price. Had a tiny scratch near the edge. Was just small enough for me to not want to deal with returning it. My dad, who is much more experienced than I am, tells me that it's a decent filter, though he notes that there are much better ones on the market (albeit for a higher price)."
1,"All is well, except for the fact that the seller delivered the wrong Optical Density Filter","The filter looks fine, except for the fact that the seller shipped a 0.6 OD (2 stop) filter when i had ordered for a 0.9 (3 stop)filter. I got it shipped to my temporary US address, and somebody carried it back to India for me. Saw it today and was shocked! Guess there is no point in spending postage money to send back a $12 wrong item to the US. Will have to live with it. The seller was Digital Darkroom & Photography Inc (K&M Camera). Be careful with the seller in the future. The packet says it is a 0.9 OD filter, while on the filter it says it is a 0.6 OD filter. I think you will agree that i should believe the filter reading. What a waste of time and money! For the first time i have had such a bad experience at Amazon!"
2,Loose Glass,"I think I just had bad luck, but my filter arrived with very loose glass that rattled when you shook it. It was close to falling out so I had to return it. Sounds like this is not common from the other reviews, however."
5,Great for long exposure photography,I've enjoyed using this for long exposure photography. It does what you'd expect. I am using it on a Nikkor 18 - 135 DX lens on a Nikon d80.
2,Not good;Gray color on all images & not enough good exposure time,"The product does not work the way it is mentioned. There is always a gray color on the image no matter what time of the day you shoot. Even at F36, ISO100 in the evening, i wont get .5 seconds or more exposure time. So I don't recommend this buying at all. If you are shooting a sun set at ocean, i was thinking red colors on the sun with blurry ocean waves.. to get that u need atleast .5 seconds and you wont get that with this filter."
3,"Its ok, I got confused","I was looking for a ND 10, or in Tiffen terms, a 3.0.I thought 9 was as good at 10, dint see the 0. in front of it, was too excited reading tutorials.It works at a 0.9 filter. though I dint find the 0.9 great in a tropical climate. I need moar!"
4,Learn about the ND filters before you buy one.,"If you think this is the strongest ND filter you can get, then it is wrong. DO NOT BUY THIS. This is only 3-stop and there are 9 or 10 stop filters available. Learn about ND filters before settling on one.With this ND filter, you cannot take pictures of water falls in bright day light (even with smallest aperture (F22)). But if you want to take the same later in the day (around sunset), this will help you a lot. I took lots of pictures using this filter during my trip to Yosemite. I could take really nice waterfall motion (with 1 sec exposure during sunset) but all the pictures I took during day time were washed out...they all became too bright.If you have a polarizing filter, you may stack on top of it (be careful with vignetting) to get more darkness.The filter itself is very well built and I was able to easily screw/unscrew from the lens. I would put some more money to get more f-stop. I will post some sample pics I took soon."
4,Doesn't play well with Canon 24-105/4L IS,"I've put this filter on many Canon lenses and it's worked just fine with no perceivable loss in image quality EXCEPT on one lens.For about a week, I used this off and on a 24-105/4L IS. Near the end of the week I noticed a faint scratch/abrasion in the dead center of the filter as well as on the front element of the lens. Thus, I stopped using it (on the trip). When I returned to civilization and the land of the internet, I did some searching and found quite a few other folks (on dpreviewDOTcom) complaining about the same issue with the Tiffen filter and their 24-105/4L lens.All in all, I'd recommend this filter, but try it on all the lenses you intend to use to make sure there's some clearance between the filter and the front element."
3,Nice,"Excellent for making creative photos, explore and enjoy other times light photograph of a slightly differently. you will not regret it."
2,Didnt seem to make a difference,"Only tried it once, but we didn't notice it doing much of anything for us"
1,"Inclusions are enormous, looks like chunks of gravel!","The diamonds had black inclusions that seemed to occupy a major fraction of the diamonds volume. I expected something that would be visible on close inspection with the naked eye, but these are visible from 5 feet away ! They are the most dominant feature of the diamonds ! I have seem I2s before and needed a loop to see the includions. These are just unacceptable !Pretty much ruined a 50th birthday as a gift, these stones are junk.AVOID !"
5,I love this movie,"I can remember watching this movie many times when i was a young kid (im only a teenager now, but you get the point.)after about ten years, i was reminded of this movie and immediately went to find my home-taped Disney Channel copy.popping it in, I was instantly brought back to the world i love so much. Felix purists may decry this movie for its lack of ties to the original cartoon, but i see it as simply a different view of the same felix. the dark, twisted story line wont bore adults, but the family-friendly diologue (meaning the lack of cursing or any sexual references) and loveable characters (felix, a dumpy librarian-like royal aid, and an old miner-type called Pim) make the movie enjoyable for kids, who wont catch the dark undertones of the plot. I have always enjoyed this movie, and i always will. felix the cat is the best."
4,FELIX IS TWIZTED,"I dont know how the writers came up with this concept of a Felix the cat movie, but i think some late nights listening to Pink Floyd and Journey may have helped. I first saw this movie on television at a young age. The movie struck a dark chord with me, the movie can be frightening and sureal at times. However, no matter how many critics hated this film, it will never have an impact on my view. I think Felix is late night movie material. It is to be watched when your mind is clear, and you are in a state of rest. The story is out of this world, something dreamt of, having no relevance to Felix the cat. Yet, the animation is great, and its boldness sticks with you. Watch it, if you can actually find a copy anywhere, and enjoy."
4,good research!,"I ordered this book for a research paper on western expansion and Native American culture. I was not able to read it from cover to cover, but was able to extract a lot of useful data, facts, and stories, and the author helped me feel what it must have been like to be overtaken by the new settlers. The maps were very helpful as well. It was very interesting and I will probably sit and read it all the way through when school is out."
1,Revisionist whitewash,"Native Americans did suffer tremendous injustices at the hands of EuroAmericans - no student of history could deny that. Mr. Wilson, however, makes his case by continually trivializing any hint of violence or savagery on the part of Indian raiders in order to paint his simplified portrait of white/Native relations. There are two sides to any story, and while the Native side was woefully slighted in the nineteenth and early 20th century histories, the solution is not to whitewash the story in the other direction. Mr. Wilson frequently makes sweeping assertions (claiming that Pequot warriors never tortured prisoners or even killed when it was unnecessary) without the slightest citation to back up his refutation of documented facts."
1,Book of Lies,"For anyone considering buying this book--save your money; for anyone considering reading this book--don't waste your time. If you have ever met a Cherokee in your life, a real Cherokee, not merely someone who lives on the rez or is eligible for government handouts, but I mean if you have ever met a real Cherokee then you will know that if you read this book you will not be reading about Cherokee people. Instead you will read information that was published to toy with your mind, it was published out of an attempt to fool you and lead you away from the truth.*The Cherokee are truly fascinating people, beautiful, intelligent, and wise, in fact they are very special."
4,The Earth Shall Weep is a must read.,"If you found this book to your liking, you should read ""A New World"". It was on the New York Times most Notable List for quite some time. These two books do history much justice by striping away the romanticism that has infected our educational system, and imbued it with straightforward facts and narratives. ""A New World"" does a better job on illustrating the mentality of both cultures by showing their greed and political manuevering. Both books should be required high school reading."
4,Brilliantly written book about a tragic era in American history,"It's not the earth shall weep, it's everyone who should weep for the awful treatment of Native Americans by Euro American colonists. After the prologue, which read like an academic paper that almost sent me to sleep, the remaining book was very engaging.The book explained in horrific detail what happened to the tribes of each region. While brilliantly written, with every turn of the page, I kept hoping the story would get better, but it never did; Native Americans were often massacred without provocation, were lied to and betrayed multiple times by colonists and the American government, and had their land taken from them.I felt despair and sadness for them just reading their history, I hate to imagine how the Native Americans, who survived, must have felt as all these injustices were being committed against them.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the relationship between Native Americans and colonists."
2,More like an Adult rap,the songs don't really minister to the kids although kid's voices were used in the background. I had to return this CD because I felt it was not a real kid's praise songs-unlike the ones created by Hosanna and Integrity Music. They should move this album to a different category.
5,GODS WORD SET TO MUSIC,"This tape is wonderful. It is Gods word set to music. If you want to hide Gods word in your childs heart (and yours also) then this is the tape. It is upbeat and faithful to the Bible. My daughter loves it, it has been her favorite for 3 years!"
4,"Great Value, Great Product, Great Retailer!","The Pentax PF-65ED AII Spotting Scope w/Zoom Eyepiece is great spotting scope. I bought for my son and myself so we could have a versatile ""telescope"" that we could use for both bird watching and moon gazing. It is a lot more portable than compared to the bigger 80 mm lens but well built and solid.I like the fact that the ocular lens use the same fitting as the 1.25"" astronomical fittings so there is a lot of choices to use if I plan to upgrade. I have the 20x-60x zoom Pentax XF ocular lenses. It is a great eyepiece with good zoom. The field of view is not as wide as the fixed magnification eyepieces but nevertheless, the view through it is sharp and clearer for the price range (others scope with slightly better optics cost several thousand dollars!)Also, Willoughby's is a great retailer. I called them up to confirm the eyepiece and they were very helpful. They shipped the item fast.Very pleased overall."
3,"Great visuals, but slim in value for a $20 book","Paul Pope's sci-fi, circus escape artist tale - ""Escapo,"" is a visual tour-de-force for afficionados of black and white comic book visuals. Each panel conveys grand drama and sweeping motion to give the overall story a jittery, fast-forward motion feel to it. Also of note is the remarkable emphasis placed on lettering, which certainly adds to the overall high quality graphic feel to the book.On the downside, this slim book is somewhat skimpy in content. Most readers will probablly finish this book within 20-30 minutes and that's factoring in the extra time used when savouring the artwork and reading through the somewhat grandstanding author profile at the beginning of the book. All in all though, it is certainly worth your reading time or as an 'add' to your collection if you come across it at a decent price."
4,Cantor's Transfinite Numbers Are Ready for High Schools,"This book tells me that Georg Cantor's work in mathematics is ready to be taught in high schools. Earlier books on Cantor are too mathematical, hide truths about life, and hide God from the general public. The author brings life into Cantor. The problem is that mathematicians have removed life out of Cantor's work by rejecting God and God's determinate infinity.The author's discussion of mathematics on p.19 should be given lots of attention. There, he has words of Imre Lakatos and Morris Kline on the danger of logic. My recent book on 'The First Scientific Proof of God' shows that some opposing concepts can coexist, but only if God exists. By taking Cantor's work into the high schools, mathematicians might learn that their work can be unified with life and that God really exists."
1,Shearing for those who like the obscure,"I love George Shearing. The ""Shearing Sound"" which is basically the piano, vibes and guitar playing the same lead line in unison is not present on the cd. Sound quality is the worst. It actually admits to taking some of this from vinyl disks.. not the tapes used to produce the vinyl... but the disks themselves. Pops and scratches are audible. Listen... there are those of you who won't mind. It is a great music piece if you're interested in the artist's history and development in the early years. I'm not a purist, but I'd like to see some effort on the part of these producers to put something audibly sound together. No effort taken here. Save your money."
1,BEWARE!!,"This thing was a disaster! It printed all of two pages before malfunctioning. First, it pulled two sheets of paper through, then it pulled about 10 sheets through, and now it keeps giving a message that the printer cartridge cradle can't move because of a paper jam or obstruction. The HP technician walked me through all the trouble-shooting steps before declaring it a hardware problem and offering me a new one at no cost (but he wanted my credit card number as security until I shipped the defective one back). Uh, no. This thing is going back, back, back and I do NOT want another one. This was supposed to replace my problematic Epson... MMMph. At least the Epson lasted for a few months before it broke. I just bought this one two days ago."
2,C4150 A disappointing product.,"I've had this printer for two years. It generally works.It prints black and white. It prints color on full sheets.The scanner usually works, though it can be quirky.One of the reasons I bought it was to print standard 4x6photos. It has a cassette for this purpose. But I couldnever get it to work. HP tech support couldn't solve it.They even implied that this is a troublesome feature.Looking around the Web shows that I'm not the only onewho can't print 4x6.So I have to print 4x6 photos on 8 1/2 x ll sheets andcut them out. It is hard to understand why a companylike HP would release such a mediocre product, why ithas not been tested.I have two of their laser printers and the reliabilityof those influenced me into buying the C4150 and an HPlaptop. Luckily the laptop has run well for two years.But HP's reputation has suffered with the inkjet experience."
1,Another Crapphy HP printer,"This printer is horrible I have owned and worked on several printers over the last few years, this is by far the worse one, it is completely useless. Even the ink was poor quality that came with it. I would not recommend this printer to anyone."
5,Slow Ride??,"If so many people think ""Slow Ride"" is the best song on this album, than perhaps they ought to listen to it again. I played this album to death in the '70's, and I still love it today. Foghat brought slide guitar into mainstream rock and roll, and covered many early blues songs such as ""Terraplane Blues"" written by Robert Johnson.This album is great, without question, the band's best! Enjoy!"
5,Doesn't get much better than this....,"What more can be said about an album that needs no introduction?? Talk about BOOGIE.... These guys just boogied their way into all of our bedrooms in 1975. ""Slow Ride"" , although being their most ""popular"" song, was as good an all-out rocker as ANYTHING that came before or since. Talk about a slow-ride to happiness.... I believe the bass player's name was Nick Jameson and he produced this album as well as playing some seriously incredible bass to compliment Lonesome Dave's and Rod's excellent guitar work. Hats off to FOGHAT! If you believe in the spirit of rock and roll, you GOTTA have this."
3,Foghead - Fool for the CD,"I'll start by saying that ""Fool For The City"" is a decent album, with a few good songs, like ""Slow Ride"", ""Save You Loving (For Me)"" and ""Fool For The City,"" but the rest is weak, almost embarrassing and simply not memorable. I remember buying this album along with ""Come Taste The Band"" by the later 70's Deep Purple and completely falling in love with Purple's bluesy-funky-groovy feel, which surprised me at the time. To this day, ""Come Taste The Band"" still blows away ""Fool For The City"" in my opinion. It's just lucky for Foghat that their two big hits are here, yet, I'd still take Purple's any day. Both albums have that great 70's sound quality. If Fool for the City is Foghat's best, I won't be digging deeper into their catalogue.Fool for the City - 3 starsCome Taste The Band - 4 1/2 stars (Check out my review on January 19, 2006.)"
3,SLOW RIDE,"If you are a fan to road music, you may want to pick this up today because Slow Ride is a great road song, Slow Ride is probably Foghat's only good song and biggest hit from the album.If you don't like Slow Ride, then get lost in the desert."
2,2 stars for just the song slow ride on fool for the city.,Hey has anyone but me noticed the little screw ups in this cd. its like right in the middle of slowride there are a few clicks. it figures right in the middle of the only good song on the cd. i got this cd in the late 80's or early 90's i can't remember for shure but i noticed it way back then and have been waiting for a remastered version of this album or another album with this song without the screw ups. i had a yes album that had defects it was didtorted like it was a radio with its volume up to loud. so when they released the remaster i got it and it was perfectly clear. and by the way fogat does have more than one good song.1.Slowride 2.Stone Blue 3.I Just Wanna Make Love To You 4.Fool for the city.
1,Only 1 Good Song On This Poorly Made CD,"This is a sexy album. Especially every song except Slow Ride.Buy this album, but listen to nothing but Slow Ride and listento it over n over again."
4,Soundtrack to my teen years,"Nice to see all the reviews from old rockers who remember this one. If you attended high school during the mid-70s, you owned a Foghat LP. This one was the best. Lots of great air-guitar worthy songs. You can't be disappointed with this CD."
1,Slow Ride Is The Only Good Foghat Song Ever Made,"Fog Hat made only one good song they ever did, Slow Ride, therest of the CD is crap!!!!!! Good bug."
4,Monster boogie!,"Allright, it wasn't the most intelligent rock music, but it is still great to listen to when you're driving in the highway or having a good time with people that also dig 70's long-haired rock'n'roll.That said, about the songs: ""Slow Ride"" is the classic (or at least the AM hit), very well produced and the grand finale is pretty much devastating. ""Fool for the city"" is another strong hard boogie and ""Terraplane Blues"" the perfect booze-rock. The rest is also gung ho rock'n'roll, with the exception of ""Take or live it"", a ballad with keyboards and a mood quite different from the no-frills electric attack of the album, but it is still allright.Even being more commercial than Foghat's previous works, it is arguably their best album. Just let Foghat rock! It is quite possible that one of the boys in ""That 70's Show"" someday will appear with a T-shirt of the band or that ""Slow Ride"" will be played in the show. And that would be groovy!"
3,NOT a multi-channel version,"Be aware that though a hybrid SACD (SACD and standard CD player compatible), the disc does not contain a multi-channel track. It is listed as containing one on some places on the internet (though not on Amazon)."
5,Take a Slowride,"Take a ""Slowride,"" all 8:41 bone-crushing worth -- arguably Foghat's most well-known and trademark song, catch it on this disc. Fool for the City (1975) is good ol' boogie rock and roll. Of particular interest along with ""Slowride"" is the title cut, ""Fool for the City"", ""My Babe"", and a good cover of ""Terraplane Blues"". These guys from Britain played straight-ahead, get up and move, rock. In addition, Foghat's live shows were really the best stuff they did; unfortunately, their live act was never caught that well on disc."
2,very repetitive,"Good quality of recording, but a few songs, played more than once in this record. I dont't like so."
5,Highly Useful,"The author has really given this book his 100%.There is a lot of useful information in here to provide much thought about what to eat. I've already started applying these principles towards my own well-being by giving up my coffee habit. I drink a product I found on the net made from soya beans and it's not only delicious but good for you too. You can find them at www.s o y c o f f e e .c o m. Thanks to this book, the various incredible tips and suggestions it has provided, which I'm sure will prove useful to everyone and the new diet I follow I surely feel great!"
2,Lots lacking in this book,"There are probably thousands of book about Candida on the market. For whatever reason, I chose this one. It's sadly lacking in information all of which I later found on the Internet for free. For one, it doesn't offer a suggested protocol (series of steps) to follow for the diet. For another, it doesn't offer any recommendations on dosages for the nonprescription anti-fungals. And it doesn't really go into any depth about die-off and the need to take Molybdenum prior to starting an anti-Candida regimen."
2,Too technical!,"I bought this book since everyone was giving it 5 stars. The first part of the book was o.k., but then, it got into way too much detail. I found the descriptions of the cells, lymphs and technical names for every enzyme pretty boring. I had to make myself finish reading it. Buy it if you want to read every detail of the immune system. If you are like me and need something more basic, look on."
2,Boring!,This book was so dry and so boring. It was very clinical. I was hoping for a list of the sypmtoms of candidiasis and some helpful suggestions on how to control the condition. Most of the book was not helpful or useful to me.
5,return to Jerusalem,This book illustrates the miraculous similarity between Gods creation of the world in six days and the Six Day war which replaced Jerusalem back in the hands of the Jewish people in six days and then rested on the seventh. Israel was partitioned in 1948 but the state did not have its eternal capital. However in six days it was recreated and the emotional spiritual story of non religious secular kibbutz soldiers is the special magic of this book. It truly touches on the most sensitive issues of israeli values. Worth the read.
3,Doesn't Swing.,"Beautifully sung and probably definitive performances but Ella is a little reserved and it just doesn't feel loose enough to really be called ""jazz"""
3,"Good, but not as good as first, less belivable","This book is good, but not as good as the first. By the end of this book these characters are worn out and its time that he strays from the using the Tom McInnes clan in his books. Despite lackluster characters, his mastery of dialogue, description and plot keep this a very good book. It's sad though, because I look on this sight and see that his next book once again has Tom McInnes and his buddies, who are just to worn out to be effective characters. Hopefully his book after A Clean Kill will have new characters and new situations."
4,No surprises my foot!! This was a good book!!,"If this book didn't keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what could possibly happen next, I don't know what would. Up until the last few paragraphs, the book twisted and turned with all sorts of possible changes.True to form, Mr Stewart has written an excellent book, with characters that are good, but not quite as good as his first work, Sins of the Brother.There is one picky detail that I'm stuck on, since I live in Mobile. The last time I checked, I-65 runs north/south, and I-10 runs east/west...."
4,Great action swamped by implausibilty,I'm going to keep picking up Stewart's books because the pacing and style are becoming more polished. An absolutely riveting page turner that is killed by being too complicated. Keep it simple. A good book doesn't need three endings. How do all those bodies go undiscovered? Our hero figures out the complex and overlooks the obvious. Strangers divulge secrets and offer aid without motive. There's a great book coming and I will wait.
5,Great Page Turner,"After reading two pages of Dog Island, I knew this was a book I had to finish. Mike Stewart does a masterful job of grabbing your attention early and keeping you guessing in which direction the characters will go next. This is a mystery that you won't figure out until the end (but don't start there). Great job Mike, and thanks for the autograph (New Orleans 2/17/01). I will definitely follow up with Sins of the Brother."
4,Thrilling,"See story summary above.An engaging mystery thriller set in the panhandle of Florida and parts of Alabama. The story moves at a good pace and provides plenty of thrills and some graphic violence. The lead character, Tom McInnes, seems to smart off quite a bit when he's surrounded by the enemy, which seems somewhat stupid, but other than that he's quite likable. An overall smoothly written novel laced with humor and bodies. I'm looking forward to the follow up to this novel, which is obviously to be expected, because of the unexpected....Recommended for thrills and mystery."
3,King of the Wild Stallions,"""King of the Wild Stallions"" was made in 1959 and stars George Montgomery andDiane Brewster. One of the better of the many 'boy and his horse' westerns, itis simply the story of conflict between a rancher who badly wants the rewardmoney for the capture of the wild stallion and a young boy who is set on owningthe horse for himself.However, I believe that the story suffers from too much time being spentviewing the roaming herds of wild horses.The movie is in its original widescreen format and color."
3,WHERE'S THE BOLT?,"Obviously aimed at a teen market, BOLTNECK is a diverting, unremarkable film loosely based on the Frankenstein legend. Matthew Lawrence stars as the genius who wants to bring something back to life. He gets his chance when two jocks accidentally kill a nerd (delightfully played by Ryan Reynolds). Lawrence rejuvenates him but unknowingly uses the brain of a recently killed murderer/robber. The new Reynolds is cool, and an asskicker. Meanwhile, Lawrence has fallen for the demure Macy (a lovely Christine Lakin), and he wants to win her over, in spite of his creation.Shelley Duvall and Judge Reinhold as Lawrence's parents are awful, but they aren't really that integral to the movie. What little effects there are won't make you forget Terminator, but it's a pleasant and harmless little movie."
4,It's Exactly What You Expect It To Be,"I bought this movie without seeing it because I love straight-to-DVD campy horror, and I love Ryan Reynolds. It's fun, cheesy, and kept me entertained. It's not rated, but would be an easy PG-13 for mild violence and brief language. Not as good as Idle Hands (one of my faves), but in the same vein. Think Hocus Pocus with more adult humor."
5,A quick Review,"BoltneckFrank Stein uses his father's research to bring a popular jock back form the dead in order to get popular. Good news is that Frank is in the in-crowd with the newly resurrected Karl. Bad news is that Karl was given the brain of a mass murder. Now Frank has to stop Karl before he kills the homecoming queen (Buffy's Bianca Lawson).This movie was done before on Fox with Daniel Ragsdale of Herman's Head fame. This time we get Matthew Lawrence, along with Kenny Blank (in one of his rare on camera roles), Christine Larkin, Richard Moll, Judge Reinhold and Shelly Duvall. If you need a harmless movie for Halloween, this is the one to show."
4,the most misunderstood device,"I have seen more incorrect reviews for this camera than problems with American government. Maybe they're shipping multiple versions to confuse the masses and destroy their brand. MY version of this fine little camcorder does have an internal memory and it holds more images than the mint holds coins. It's a great camera which fits in your pocket, features a external doo-hickie which you can attach to your helmet, car hood, tank or hang-glider. The draw back, doesn't do too well indoors without all the lights on and my computer belched out the software (which i do not have time to fuss with). i found the device to be very user friendly. my wife thinks it's because i'm technically savvy, but hey, how true can that be, i don't even have an i-pod."
1,Samsung SC-X300L,"Yes, there are multiple versions of this camera out there. This seems to be a huge problem. The one I purchased does not take stills, does not have the built in LED flash, or the 2gb on board flash memory as described on the web site I purchased it from. This is false advertisement. Buyer beware. As far as how the camcorder operates, read the other threads. I only gave it one star because of false advertisement."
3,"Neat, but misrepresented","It's a nice camera; HOWEVER, the description says that it comeswith 1GB of built-in memory. IT DOES NOT COME WITH BUILT-IN MEMORY.It will not work without an additional SD or MMC memory card sold separately.It might have gotten 4 stars, but I got this via overnight shipping fora paragliding trip expecting it to more or less work out of the box.Now I have to go out and overpriced memory at some retailer. Argh!"
4,Novel approach to a very old problem,"The beauty of this book is that it has an index of verb stems, verb endings and noun endings. For example, you can look up dadarsha in the index, and it will point you to the root drsh. If have a verb that ends in -ata, it will lead you to the possible paradigms that use that ending. The book also has a very comprehensive list of major parts of the verb, listing 400-odd roots."
5,You will love this,What a video.....you will really love these two stories.VERY WELL DONE!!!! Quality all the way through.ENJOY!!!
4,You have better options.,"In this book, the student gets practice in diatonic scales, hand-crossing, octave jumps, and dotted rhythms.This book offers practice in left-hand and right-hand arpeggios,thirds, slurs, staccato, repeated notes, chromatic and diatonic scales, and triplets.The harmony is more interesting than in opus 64, but not much. In #8, there are a couple of minor substitution chords in the melody. In #9, there is a secondary dominant followed by a relative minor chord.I still say that Concone, Gurlitt, and Burgmuller are better choices."
4,Nice product! but is for thin face,"I bought these sunglasses, design and quality are very good or excellent, but if your face is too wide does not work, because they are for thin faces."
3,Novel about Chinese life,"From the Preface: What is a novel but ""a little talk,"" as the namehsiaoshuo implies? So, reader, listen to thislittle talk awhile when you have nothing better to do.This novel is neither an apology for contemporaryChinese life nor an exposé of it, as so many recent Chinese ""dark curtain"" novels purport to be. It is neither aglorification of the old way of life nor a defense of thenew. It is merely a story of how men and women in thecontemporary era grow up and learn to live with oneanother, how they love and hate and quarrel and forgiveand suffer and enjoy, how certain habits of living andways of thinking are formed, and how, above all, theyadjust themselves to the circumstances in this earthlylife where men strive but the gods rule."
5,An Epic Historical Fiction of China,"During the mid-1960s A Moment In Peking was the first book by Lin Yutang I ever encountered. The work impressed me enough to cause me to search everywhere to find everything else he ever published in English. After I'd done so, at considerable time and trouble, I concluded that Moment in Peking was his most enjoyable read. I made it a policy to read it again, at least once per decade until I loaned my copy to someone and lost it.I think you'll love this book."
5,An account of stalag life telling what it was really like,"An account of the mission of the B-17 Toonerville Trolley, the shoot-down, memories and experiences of the crew members, the German FW 190 pilot, who made the ""kill"", and the German witnesses. The account of stalag life amd experiences has none of the histrionics shown in other books, and all is done in a low-key manner that I have not seen before. Later on, when someone asks what it was like, I will simply hand them this book and say, ""Read this and you will know."""
5,Fascinating book about meeting of enemy flyers over Germany,"It is a unique piece of work, so different from what is normally found on the subject of World War II. On the one hand are the experiences of the cuel days of war, and on the other, my own recollections of our futile attempts to stop the armadas of Flying Fortresses, then finally meeting the author so many years later in an atmosphere of friendship, almost as if we had been members of the same squadron."
5,Complete story of Stalag Seventeen,"This is a wonderful, complete account of Stalag Seventeen. I like everything about it; research, writing, story constuction and all."
1,Unfortunate to say the least...,"Here are my points:1 - First of all, this guy is a marginal guitarist at best. He is incredibly sloppy and even his ""fast"" runs are often played on one string with no articulation and tons of mistakes. The lack of virtuosity is obvious in a form of music in which it is required. Listen to Jesse Cook, Paco de Lucia, Johannes Linstead, Incendio, Tomatito, Vicente Amigo, and even Lara and Reyes. You may not like their music, but the level of guitar playing is obvious.2- The songcraft is poor. Listen to ""Bola"" or ""Jardin"" by Strunz and Farah and hear the perfect marriage of great guitarmanship and songwriting.3 - There is no depth to the music, no history. He sounds like a rocker that said ""I can't make it in pop so maybe I can play some Spanish guitar and make some money""."
5,Desitin Diaper Rash Ointment-Creamy,"The Desitin Creamy-Zinc Diaper Rash Ointment is the only product I can use on my bottom side. I have tried a great many products but this is the only one that protects and heals at the same time. I do not know where I would be with out this product as I have an acid problem which I have even had prescriptions for. It is inexpensive and I highly recommend it. It can be used by adults as well as children. I only get the results from the creamy product.Destin Creamy-Zinc Oxide Diaper Rash Ointment, 2/ 4.8oz Tubes"
5,~*BEST CREAM FOR SENSITIVE SKIN*~,"~*Desitin (creamy) cleared up my newborns rash within days! WAY BETTER THAN A&D WHICH WORSENED RASH!!!!! they have VERY sensitive skin, just like their mommy! The only diaper cream I will use!*~"
4,The World for a hundred bucks,"Amazing book. I have it opened in a special table so I come home everyday, grab a beer and take my time for visual enjoyment and architectural travelling around the world. Nice edition and good selection."
2,Worlds Apart,"As an interested reader and observer modern architecture, I'm at best at novice in my expanse the ""state of the art"". I have heard of many of the known suits in the modern world that been said I find it strange that missing is virtually any examples of architecture from the developing world. This in my estimate perpetuates a stereotype of modern architecture by default of representative omissions.However even in the developed world of modern architecture where is mention of Rem Koohaas, the Dutch giant of global architecture? Not one word. Another real issue for me with the expense of this book is this total lack of editorial oversight. Notice the samples of architecture in Baja California. Now check your atlas, not the map Phaidon has provided, as it is totally wrong. The Ensenada location apart from being on the wrong coast looks more like it is in San Felipe. The Cabo San Lucas location is closer to La Paz."
3,semi late notification,"Unfortunately after a month I was notified that they were not able to find the book for me and they cancelled my order. I knew this may happen as this book is out of print. I would have however, liked to be notified earlier. But still, thanks for trying to find the book for me."
4,It's cheaper on Amazon!,"I'm not gonna talk about the book. Debate the content all you want to. I'm just here to tell you that if you want to buy it, you'll probably do better buying it here. Although I am an Amazon addict, I learned the hard way. I bought it at a store, figuring that the shipping for this bad boy would be so ridiculous I might as well. I was wrong. Amazon was about $100. Shipping was like 15 bucks or something. This book in a store was 160 plus tax!My boyfriend loves it, although it puts his legs to sleep if he leaves it on his lap too long."
3,Other then what I expected,"I thought, I could find the best architectural samples of construction world. Sincerely, I could not find it. yes there are more than 1000 buildings and some of them are very exiting but I am not satisfied. I would take a small tour in my town and see more rather than buying this book.Moreover, it is too heavy to carry and keep."
1,"PLEASE READ: ScAmazon.com Great Book, But an Amazon Scam. Do NOT Buy","I ordered this on January 30th.It is March 31st today, and is currently slated for deliver in LATE APRIL. I am confident they won't make that date either. My order has been delayed over and over and this is not the first time amazon has pulled this stunt with me. I ordered one of the Detail series books last year and after approx 4 months finally gave up and cancelled that order.Really shameful business practice, and I believe it is potentially illegal to post something for sale saying it is available at one price, but only shipping to those that buy at full price. I urge any other people like me that have had this experience to file complaints with your local attorneys general and better business bureaus.Amazon ought to be ashamed of themselves, and they've definitely lost me and others in my family as customers."
5,A superb achievement,"8 kilos - but not too hard to bear! Whoever wants to know about the jewels of modern architecture in the last 5 year, he must have this book. It covers great buildings as well as lesser known gems in exotic places. BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!"
5,The Best New Christmas Book!,"Every year my family goes to the bookstore and selects a book to add to our Christmas Book collection. This year we all agreed that Two Christmas Mice was the one. We loved the illustrations! My little brother doesn't read yet, but he is really good at telling the story using the pictures. I think your family will enjoy this book as much as mine does!"
5,Mice in the House,This delightful story appeals to youngsters and adults. We used it on Yuletide to encourage interest on tours of a historical home. I read it to a 5 year old prior to the visit and he looked for the charming mice in each room with squealing delight!
1,Worse than bad.,"Gone in 60 Seconds is even worse than Battlefield Earth, it's so bad it's not even funny."
1,Seems like 60 years,"What an unbelievable waste of time.Angelina Jolie has never looked uglier or acted as badly - if you call that acting at all.Nicolas Cage and Robert Duvall are completely wasted. What were they thinking?Delroy Lindo is the only one who seems to be having any fun, but he has too little screen time.And what about that ""villain""? I have never seen such a ridiculous character, and the actor just stinks.The story is one hundred percent predictable form the first scene. And there is no direction in sight.Run away from this one, folks."
2,Gone in Sixty Seconds? I wish.,"For the life of me I can't figure out why either of the two stars in this movie are stars, and being stars, I can't figure out why either would want to be associated with this piece of retread. Oh wait a minute. That's right. Money. If you like cars, chases, guns, explosions, you know, huevos things, and don't mind a stupid story, by all means waste your money. I considered ejecting this mess in a little over sixty seconds, but jeez, it was like watching multiple car wrecks, if you know what I mean."
1,So bad it's not even funny.,"Anybody notice the year 2000 was the summer of slow-beginning action films? From this film, M:I-2, Shaft, and The Perfect Storm, you have a setup that begins rather slowly. The only difference is, the latter 3 movies I mentioned are actually good. Gone in 60 Seconds is awful. There are reasons for that. Number one: It's boring. Number 2: it's stupid. Number 3: It wastes a good cast (though to be fair, it's not as if though Cage, Jolie, Duvall, and Lindo were never in their own fair share of bad movies)."
3,poor reviews? so what?,"I'm sick of reading poor reviews of this movie, if you don't expect anything from it, you'll love it! (Assuming that you enjoy classic cars, plenty of action, and basically, just action.. as well as some comic remarks). Just don't think about the plot or poor character development, and enjoy the excellent action scenes. It's a no-commitment movie you can watch over and over, that will certainly excite you!"
2,I wish the movie was gone in 60 seconds,"Well another brainless action thriller. I just thought that the acting was terrible in this one. The one scene that stands out in my mind is Nicolas Cage whispering sweet nothings to one of the cars. I guess I have a problem with movies that are totally unrealistic, unless they go out of there way to profess that they are unrealistic. The Evil Kinevil car jump scene is one of these that defies logic. There is plenty of action, if that is your thing. However, if you are expecting a movie that will leave an impression on you, then you will be very disappointed."
2,Awesome!,I loved this movie! I am a huge Nicholas Cage fan! He is so cool in this movie! I could watch it over and over nonstop! Nick in a black leather jacket? OOHH LAA LAA! It is such a kickin movie! He just makes this movie happen! Nobody can watch this movie just once! It gets better and better everytime I watch it! Definately buy this one!
4,Not so bad the second time...,"I first saw ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" in the theatres its opening weekend back in June. After seeing it I was totally dumbfounded of the entire movie. Then after seeing it on the video store shelves, I decided to give it another shot. Wow, there's something about watching a movie in the privacy of your home. This movie is awesome!Touchstone pictures did a wonderful job of touching up the DVD menus and adding a sense of danger and intrigue to the DVD. I'm now happy to say that I own a copy of the film. Don't listen to critics, be your own judge. But rent first before you decide to buy. Hurry though, this DVD might be gone in sixty seconds!"
1,Three strikes and your out,First off this movie is a remake of a chip's wannabe cheesy 70's action movie.2nd Nick Cage is playing the exact same charecter from Con AIR just with a less funny name.3rd since this movie is pg13 you know Angelina Jolie will be fully clothed the whole time
2,not that good,I've written some longer reviews lately and i'm tired. so i shall be brief in my attempt to summarize gone in sixty seconds the new one with Cage. It's stupid slow with no true high octane chase scenes like the original. it seems to only bare its resemblance to the original in general idea and name. it's not very good. Jolie is barely in the movie Ribisi and Duvall's talents are as expected wasted. Nice cars but with no real plot to help distinguish itself and not any really good acting it falls short of even just three stars. thank you and have a good day or night whichever it is.
3,"Great soundtrack, light movie","Just want to say that if you're in this for some heavy drama, keep looking. If you're in this because you like fast cars and have a fascination with speed, stop here. The reason I bought this DVD was because of the soundtrack. With tracks like Groove Armada's ""Rap"" amongst others, you can't beat it."
3,Gone wrong in 60 seconds,"OK, this film had a lot of hype in front of it, and sad to say, it didn't live up. If you watched this movie without seeing the original, you might enjoy it. But I gotta tell ya, this chase scene compared to the original......well there is no comparison. This one uses who knows how many Shelby GT's to make the chase scene and also uses computer graphics. The original, on the other (better) hand, used ONE for the whole chase! It was torn up at the end, but it ran. The ONLY thing better about the new one is the acting (what little there is). The first one lacked a script and the acting was horrendous, but the chase scene..oh my, the chase scene!! Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen either one, see the first one. If you've seen this one and thought it was good, you MUST see the original!"
2,Another Jerry Bruckheimer MegaBucks Experience,"Cage is the only reason to see this movie. I recently watched two Cage movies, Face/Off and this one. Face/Off is the better of the two hands down. Most Bruckheimer films look like gaudy dressed up movies with simple, linear plots with an ending you can predict about 30 minutes into the video and this is no exception. this was a horrible movie. Lets put it this way. Face/Off=Evian, 60Secs=a Glass of distilled water."
4,Pretty entertaining,"This was a fun movie to watch for someone who likes cool cars and medium-action. Nicholas Cage gives a typical Nicholas Cage performance. There are some good chase scenes, some cool-but-not-over-the-top action, and it's not super violent or anything. There's also some nice lighthearted humour to keep things real.Overall, I give it 4 stars because the plot was pretty thin, and Angelina Jolie, despite being on the cover, plays a relatively insignificant role."
2,Ice Cold. Hot Wired.,"I've seen the trailer for this quite a few times. I don't know why I've never gone out and rented the film or something. Mind you, I know nothing about cars, so I was lost for most of this film. And I didn't learn anything either.What was disappointing about this film was that Angelina Jolie didn't exactly have a big role, or as much screen-time as Nicolas Cage or Giovanni Ribsi. She's one of my favourite actresses, and I suppose that was the only reason I wanted to see the film. Although seeing Giovanni Ribsi didn't hurt.It took a long time to start, and the storyline was supposed to be that Nicolas Cage's character (Memphis) had to steal 50 cars in 4 days. By the time the film dragged out, he only had one night to steal them all. And it was so predictable how one of the cars would be ""late"" being stolen, or would get held up.Possibly a film for car fans. Not for others."
1,"How to make grand theft auto really, really boring","You should know going in: this movie is not packed with car chases. I'm not giving anything away to tell you that many, many cars are stolen in this movie. The problem is that most of them are driven away as quietly as possible--Cage & Crew are trying to steal (I think) 50 cars in one night without getting caught. So they take it slow and easy.And that doesn't make much of a car-theft movie.I expected a LOT more action than this flick delivered. Without action, a movie needs plot and characters, and this one doesn't have either."
4,good movie,"a good movie, but, i felt that the original was without a doubt better...cage was good, but supporting actors fumbled the ball!"
5,Classic,Love this movie when I was growing up. I've watched this many times over. And now I have it on Blu-Ray. The sound and picture are amazing.
4,Fun Fun Fun til Daddy takes the T-bird away.,"This movie is so much fun to watch. Very enjoyable and moves at a fast pace. There is no lag time; the soundtrack keeps certain everyone is awake. Beautiful cars, beautiful people, one helluva ride. Very entertaining, I saw it three times at the theatre. ENJOY!"
4,Film + Nitro= This Movie,"Well, no one can say this movie did not have enough action, or not enough chase scenes, and did I mention the cars? Critics who tore this movie apart really need to stop complaining about films that are only made to entertain. It seems that some idiot invented an unwritten rule that says ""movies have to have deep involving scripts to be good."" It IS true that well made films have good scripts, good characters that we can relate to, and most importantly, an involving story. Well then I guess this isn't a well made film, but SO WHAT, it's entertaining, fun, and pleasing to the eyes (cars, fun action) and ears (very loud, get on DVD). It's definately a car movie. Check it out if you can take the action"
2,Review solely on HD quality.,"This review is strictly on the quality of the HD transfer. The story alone is great whether on VHS, DVD, or HD. However, the transfer to HD isn't as good as I would have hoped. I'm actually not very demanding in regards to perfect HD quality, but lets face it, this transfer leaves a lot to be desired. I have this movie in DVD and Blu-ray. It does look better in blu-ray, however I don't feel that it was that much better that it was worth the extra cost. In some scenes, it felt like I was watching the DVD. This transfer was actually one of the more disappointing bluray transfer that I have seen. I did not notice any pixelation, but everything just wasn't sharp or defined as a true HD movie. I would recommend it if you don't already have this on DVD."
2,Nothing Special,"Promoting car chases and hijackings, there is barely any action in the movie. The starpower does little for the movie. Gone In 60 Seconds is a dialogue filled, actionless, horribly executed, poorly plotted excuse for a movie and a total disappointment."
1,"5 stars for the movie, 1 star for the trick","This is a great movie and I'm happy to see it on Blu-Ray, it just sucks how the studio chose to not release the new unrated cut that you can get now on DVD. Oh, wait... yeah the ol' double dip trick is coming. Be patient and wait for the better version to be released...or get it now on DVD and save some money in the process."
1,My $5 are gone in 60 seconds!,"The crash scenes might look great in the 70s but they look clumsy compared to today's standards. The dialogs and the acting are stiff.Although I bought it from Wal-Mart for only five dollars, I still think it's a total waste of money."
3,Gone In 60 Seconds,If you like action car chase scences the chase of Elenor the vintage Mustang is great as far as picture quality and sound it is one of the best I have seen so far. If you have a blu-ray player and HD TV along with a good surround setup you will not be disappointed. The story line is not new but well done.
3,If only the movie were 60 seconds,"While lots of people really like this movie, I do not. I am also not a Nick Cage fan. While this movie has its moments (plus Angelina Jolie!) I can't say it is one I ever want to watch again."
1,oh boy,Dumb movie. I usually enjoy films with angelina jolie but I could not even bare to watch all of this. The techno music got on my nerves and all the afro- american men with funny lines was so predictable so it became boring. I saved myself and changed the channel.
5,best movie ever,"BEST MOVIE EVER. being a real man, i love cars. and anyone who loves cars, will love this movie."
3,THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL,"GONE IN 60 SECONDS is just that...60 seconds after it's over, you'll forget it probably. The last car chase/rescue scene, however, is pure dynamite, with some exciting car driving and tension when Cage goes after Eccleston. However, getting there isn't quite as exciting. Director Dominic Sana (Swordfish) keeps things rather lethargic early on, and wastes the talents of Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall in thankless roles. Nicolas Cage gives his sincere, stoney eyed macho performance, and actors like Scott Caan, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant and Giovanni Ribisi do well, but this film doesn't rely so much on character development as the cars. Nice vintage cars, too! A purely adrenaline/testosterone film, and not one of the best, but the ending is worth the wait!"
3,Not Bad But Not Quite Good Either,Great cast. Competent direction. Some very funny dialogue (written by the guy who wrote Con Air-A way better movie). The problem with this movie is there isn't enough car chases or car wrecks like the original. The characters and dialogue was okay but for a movie like this to not have more action is unforgiveable. See 2 Fast 2 Furious if you want a good car chace/racing flick with good pacing.
5,The 60 Seconds,"well first of all this movie is rated PG-13 violence,Language,Sexual content.Te movie is an action packed thriller filled with hot old classic exotic luxury cars it is ABOUT A GUY (NICHOLAS cAGE) WHO HAS TO STEAL 50 CARS IN ONE NIGHT TO SVE HIS BROTHERS LIFE HE CHOOSES TO STEAL CARS HERE S A RECOMMENEDATION BUY THIS MOVIE ON DVD.tHIS MOVIE IS NITRO BOOSTED WITH FURY.AND THE DVD HAS EXTRAS CHECK IT OUT"
4,Great car chase scene and loved seeing the classic cars in action,"Gone in 60 seconds turn out to be a great film for car fans. Cage did a good job on the movie and the supporting cast did a wonderful job also backing him up for the movie. What did it for me was the amazing car chase scene threw the city as cops chase Cage threw the city. This is also the Director's cut so we get few extra minutes of film not in regular version. So if your looking for some intense car chase scenes, be able to see some very classic cars in their own beauty follow by some good music from the soundtrack, then this is the movie for you. Yes it is a remake but a very good one at that fact, well worth the money for the movie to watch at least once or twice."
4,GONE IN 60 SECONDS,"FUN MOVIE, PLENTY OF FAST ACTION....I'M A BIG NICK CAGE FAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS ISN'T HIS BEST, I WOULD RECOMENT IT."
5,C'mon - It's Angelina and Eleanor,"Fun movie for sure - lousy acting and flimsy plot but who cares? It's a movie with Angelina climbing into the driver's seat with Nicolas Cage and mostly, that sexy beast Eleanor...Buy it for those two things alone!"
4,Great Fun,"This movie is great fun to watch. The characters are laughable and the dialogue preposterous, but I haven't had this much fun at the movies in a long time. It's always fun to watch an all-star cast in an action movie. The car chases are great, employing the typical MTV style cutting, but I think it works contrary to most critics. I think it's pathetic for critics to hate Gone in 60 Seconds for the same reason they love Charlies Angels. This is brainless entertainment, you won't take anything away from it, but you will get your money's worth."
2,"Fast cars, big stars, (YAWN)","This was a movie that was made for summer. It had it all, big stars, numerous exotic fast stars, but why did i tire of it so quickly? There could be numerous reasons, but the underlying factor is that there has to be more to a movie than a two hour car chase scene. It was from Bruckheimer, so it was stylish action sequences, but once you see them steal one car, you have seen it all. There was some sort of a plot about his brother who would die if they could not get all the cars, but there was not enough character development done so you would be able to care whether they could pull the whole thing off. And the villian was a carpenter whose weakness was seeing his wooden creations get destroyed. Very clever stuff."
5,Great sound track,This film was great it flows very well and you wont get bored. It also has one of the best sound tracks ever and a load of well known actors and cars.Buy it now
4,Must See,"The movie was a thrill ride from beginning to end. I had to see it twice in the theatres and I can't wait to own it. People consider me a huge movie critic, so, my opinion is worth-while. The acting was great, the dialogue kept me believing, and the cars... well, let's just say you'll be impressed. ""Eleanor"" is now my dream car. I guarantee you'll enjoy this movie. However, there is one part in the movie that ended its perfection. He jumps about 50 yards over a bunch of cars and lands on all fours. Aside from that, everything was put together well. It's something for everyone... a little comedy, suspense, notorious actors, and a nice, touching ending... sure to bring a tear to your eye. A happy tear that is. Hope this was helpful. Enjoy"
4,Fun ride...,"Basic storyline: Little Kip (Ribisi) botches a 50-car boost and his big brother Memphis (Cage) comes to the rescue. They steal a bunch of really nice cars, including a 67 Shelby GT at the end.If you can suspend reality a bit, the movie is fun. It's tough to watch with my boyfriend because he is always pointing out how unrealistic everything is. I saw the movie for what it is: Pure fun. It's not an Oscar type movie that is supposed to provoke deep thoughts.My problems with it - 1) Angelina Jolie was not in it enough. 2) I'm not a fan of Ribisi and his character seemed like a whiny little baby the entire movie. 3) I had to make myself ignore the zillions of unrealistic things that happened (ie: the helicopter flying 15 feet off the ground chasing the Shelby GT).Basically it's a fun flick to watch if you like pretty cars, but people who are very analytical about movies will probably hate it."
4,A FUN MOVIE!,"Ok then. Let's just get a few things straight first of all.1: This is not going to sweep the oscars.2: This will not wow audiences with its phenominal script.Do you know why that is?... It's because this wasn't made for that! It's not that type of movie. This is an all out fun movie (or as some of us like to call them ""popcorn movies!"")So, heres my advise. You buy this movie, slap it in, turn the lights out, sit back, relax, turn up your dolby surround sound system and just enjoy it!I just wish that critcs would stop jugding these movies for something they'r not! They'r not all going to have great acting and scripts. So long as they excite and entertain the audience WHO CARES!? I don't think that there was much wrong with the acting in this, yeah some of the script was a bit cheesy but it's all part of the fun!Hope you all enjoy it!"
5,Firing on all clyinders,"Gone in 60 seconds is a adrenaline rush that grabs you from the very beginning and never lets go. But few people know that its a remake of a 1974 Classic where nearly 100 cars are destroyed in the 40 minute chase scene between a 1973 Mustang Mach 1 and the entire city of long beach. But we arent talking about that now are we?Bottom line: this is the coolest car movie out there right now, the fast and the furious comes close, but not quite. The assignment is to steal 50 Exotic beauties in 72 hours or Cage's brother gets the axe. Cool huh? With cars ranging from a 1967 Corvette to a Lamborghini Diablo. And the final car, which is none other than a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500. The sexiest car in existance.This is a guy movie, no doubt about it. But it, watch it. Then dream of Porsches and Shelbys..."
1,DVD has a problem,The dvd wouldn't load correctly to the menu. After hitting stop and forcing it to title 1 (instead of title2) if played until it met the layer transition. It will not play the second layer.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I like Nicholas Cage, but this movie has got to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The rating is so high for this movie because some guys got a little dumbstruck by a few fancy cars (and maybe Angelina Jolie) flitting across the screen. I wasn't expecting a ""quality"" film, but I thought I'd at least be entertained! This movie had no plot, no character development, and not even any good action!"
2,Confused,The Sticky doesn't really understand this movie. I mean what's the point in stealing all those bags of rice? You can just get them at your local supermarket.
1,Look away from screen to avoid seizures(in a bad way),"Im not sure who started this trend of directing movies so that they have the camera cut every 2-4 seconds. The movie SWAT and also watching Dr. Phil would be very good examples of this quick cut trend of editing. I dare anyone to watch any of the previous mentioned and be able to count to six before the camera cuts. It's impossible. Once you realize 4.9 seconds is the limit of a hold in a shot, (For me anyway) it becomes almost impossible to watch. Similar to watching a strobe light. Is it possible that it is cheaper to make productions this way or could it be a sinister plot to shorten viewer attention spans? In either case this movie is worse than watching a blank screen. It's so bad that I no longer like Nick Cage. After I started watching, I was ""Gone in about 18 minutes."""
1,I'm a car nut and I think this movie STINKS!!,"Let me start off by saying I hate Bruckheimer movies.Given that, I was still willing to give it a go because I LOVE cars, and I LOVE action movies. Hey! Cars *and* action! My kind of movie! I've never been one to listen to critics when it comes to action movies. I don't watch them expecting Oscar caliber performances or great dialogue. I watch them to have a good time.Well, I hated this movie. I was literally counting down the minutes, praying for it to end.There *are* lots of cool cars in this movie. Too bad each one is on screen for about 3 seconds as they are loaded into the back of trailers! Basically, you get to see one cool car, the Shelby, in one long chase. If this movie has any redeeming qualities, it is that chase. However, its not even good enough to make up for having to sit through this garbage.I didn't even find the engine noises to be anything special."
1,gone in 60 seconds.. out the theater doors,"I was extreamly disapointed. Even the action couldn't justify the lame script and poor acting. Watching this movie was about as exciting or entertaining as driving in bumper to bumper traffic during rush hour, with a broken radio. I was gone in 60 seconds.. to see another movie. Surprisingly poor film for Bruckheimer and Cage."
2,Nicolas Cage Academy Award Winner,"No matter how many movies i see him , i can only think of him as the ""Don Knotts of the 90's"". There appears to be no end to what an Academy Award Winner can do.the movie is boring. attempts to tease, but never really does anything. i kept thinking i should just get bullit out and watch that again, much better movie and chase scene."
2,Just another movie,"Nothing big here, just another typical action flick without much of anything else. The final car chase was pretty cool, but could not save the movie. Rent this movie, no need to buy it. It will be fun to watch if you have a good 5.1 system.Overall Grade - C"
2,fairly typical hollywood schlock,"but worth seeing for the nice cars and Angelina Jolie...who is quite hot. Nicholas Cage does his typical thing. one nice touch is the casting of Robert Duvall, who is good in almost everything he's in, as Cage's mentor and coordinator of the 'crew' pulling off all the car jobs. there are a few funny scenes and maybe one original car chase scene. don't rent this if your wife/girlfriend/mate/significant other/partner wants a chick flick..."
4,50 of the hottest cars all in one night !,"Just picked this up and at the risk of sounding too technical... ""WOW""! A far better movie than I was expecting. Granted, the cars are amazing etc, etc, but lets review the movie. You do not by any means have to be a car buff to enjoy this movie. Kind of like Field of dreams. Don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate that one either. Some very good characters here, both good and bad to enjoy. Our hero is getting pressure from all sides and up and down as well. A nice script and tight directing. Practically non-stop excitement. Cage's character has to ""acquire"" 50 of the hottest cars all in one night to save his younger brother's life as repayment for his brother's colossal screw up in a car boost. PQ is excellent. Solid blacks, colors and nice detail. SQ is very dynamic and a real treat to experience. Wish I had picked this BD up earlier! A real Gem with very good rewatchability. Highly Recommended!"
4,EROTISMO A 140 MILLAS/HORA,"Cage es extremista, Angelina esta ardiente. La mejor combinacion para esta temporada, el resultado te tendra arañando el sofa.Lo unico malo es la pobre actuación del torpe de su hermano."
1,So bad,"I thought this was such a boring film its hard to evaluate the DVD objectively so I won't even try. Even for a pure action film I thought it was boring. I didn't care about the characters. The action sequences seemed fairly canned. How many car chases can a person watch? Admittingly its hard to make a scene that everyone has probably seen a hundred times, but as much as they tried the chase scenes were fairly standard. You can watch the action highlight featurette and the time needed to watch the whole movie. Overall a very bad value. If this was at a garage sale I may pick it up for a couple of bucks but there wasn't a single thing in the movie that would make me add this to my collection."
1,GONE FOREVER,"CAge made another clever move to make huge money accepting to star this garbage, the worst production ever by producer Jerry. THis movie lacks: a) heart - commercially driven beyond limits; b) acting - with a screenplay like this, even Pacino could not save this bomb; c) exciting car chases - the car chase with the SHelby is boring, almost slept; d) plot - they managed to destroy the original film of 1974. Be it: even this being a remake, they didn't have a good plot !!All in all, I went into the movie to watch as a brainless action movie. But even so it was disgraceful. SAd."
4,'67 Mustang GT500??,Very good car flick except for the Mustang (would have been more interesting with a COPO Camaro). Nickolas Cage proves that love for a brother is much more important than mere money. Angelina Jolie gets very jiggy with it too.That Mustang gets pretty roughed up in this flick.In the end Nick Cage gets the keys to the Mustang. Too bad it won't start.
1,Lousy movie,"with nothing interesting. The movie is too predictable and overdone. I still couldn't figure out why they named it ""Gone in 60 seconds""."
4,decent movie,"I am sure the movie description written for the product is better than anything I could ever write, so I will just leave it as this is a good movie that I got a great deal on the Blu-Ray."
1,Ed Wood's movies are better than that!,"This is the very worst movie ever made. -Nicolas Cage isn't an actor, he's an impostor -the other actors are less than nothing -The cars chases are full of mistakesFinally, HOLLYWOOD is a big trash today HA"
5,Excellent Car Movie,"If you like cars, lots of cars, this is a good old fashioned, down and dirty car movie. They haven't made a film like this in years! Faced-paced, in-your-face, this movie has it all. Cars, story, cars, action, cars, chaces, cars, laughs and cars. Eat my dust! Get this one!"
4,A Good Movie,"If you like Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie, you have to see this movie. Also, you get a taste of some hot cars, and fast driving. Always teetering on the brink of being busted, the story is suspenseful and you wonder how the heck can they pull it all off. But they are professionals, and get the job done. For the most part. Four stars."
4,Entertaining,"This movie is not supposed to an oscar winning performance, it is an entertaining movie to watch and there is nothing else like it (except for the original), so I think it has some redeeming qualities just for that alone. I thought I would hate it, but I was pleasantly entertained. The only thing that got old for me was the car chase."
2,This movie sucks!,"This movie is the Ultimate Bruickheimer guy crap movie, the kind that guys drag their girlfriends to that they don't like, and this is the king of them all. I was dragged by my friend and thank God he paid the ticket!"
5,I hoped it'd be over in 60 seconds.,"My oh my oh my. This is just an awful film. I'm not just talking about the ridiculous premise or the horrible performances or the amateurish directing or the pedantic cinematography or the churlish costume design or the smelly editing or the disappointed sound mixing or the egregious soundtrack or the poor location scouting, I'm talking about the stunts and the special effects and the end credits and even the opening credits but also the terrible lighting, the deplorable makeup, hare-brained continuity and poor script. But if you can get past that, you'll find a five-star film.REVEIWER'S NOTE: (5/3/2007) I would like to apologize for the obviousness of my headline. It was a lazy choice and I apologize."
5,Movie of the year,"This movie is the best movie I have seen all year it is also the best movie of its kind, with great actors and a good story line I give it 5 stars!"
4,Great,The movie took a little longer than I was usual than expecting. I think it came 2 weeks after I ordered it (usually they come the same week). Movie is in better condition than what it said online.
4,Dirty Disk,"The case and disk looked fine when I got them but when I played the disk it skipped a couple times, I am almost certain the disk was just smudged because there was no visible damage to the disk. I would've liked to receive the item faster but other than that it was a good transaction."
3,IT'S ONLY ME BUT:,TRYING TO STEAL 60 CAR'S IN 24 HOURS. iT'S MORE ABOUT THE CARS'S AND RACING THEN IT IS ABOURT THE ACTORS. JM
3,More like 3 1/2,"I actually enjoyed this movie. Its a great ride! It has the perfect mixture of humor and fast cars. It is much more action oriented then similar car movies like the Fast and the Furious, but what would you expect from the great Jerry B. He is absolutely the king of action movies, ie. Top Gun and Amargeddon. Additionally, the movie host a score of top notch Oscar winning actors, and some fresh new faces.Overall it's a fast paced romp in the streets."
5,If you like Cage and Cars...,"The storyline is nothing spectacular. There's no twisting subplots or mystery. No heart-wrenching drama. Well, for car lovers seeing the Shelby destroyed may indeed be heart-wrenching.But if you're a fan of Nicholas Cage and like fast cars then this movie rocks! Costar Angelina Jolie certainly doesn't hurt the movie either."
4,Rainbow State,The movie was great and I loved it! Now a days I only watch Blu Ray caused I think that is the way to go in the future.
2,Gone In 60 Seconds DVD,"About what you would expect from Nicolas Cage in a Jerry Bruckheimer production. Good amount of stars in the film, but they are saddled with a ridiculous script, saying some of the dumbest lines this side of a Seagal movie. Prepare to turn off your brain before viewing this one."
3,Gone in 60 Seconds(Remake),"I liked the original way better despite my hatred for Ford products/mustangs, I really would Have liked to have seen a Corvette Instead. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a bore too. The 'Stang Eleanor is in this one, Yes it is cool,cause it is cars nonetheless but I despise remakes."
1,Do not waste your time,"If you're looking to buy this because it's ""unrated"" and you're expecting something edgier, sexier, or more violent than the original 2000 cut, don't bother -- the only reason it's ""unrated"" is that the studio didn't bother to submit it to the MPAA.In other words, it's a marketing ploy. Yes, this version is slightly different from the one previously released -- this one has all the deleted scenes re-inserted, so the film runs a few minutes longer. But there's nothing in it that wouldn't get another PG-13 if they re-submitted it.Don't waste your time, don't waste your money, and don't fall into this marketing ploy."
2,"It's pretty good, but...","...it remains pretty pale compared to the original from 1974 that was directed, produced and written by H.B. Halicki, who also starred as the main character Maindrian Pace. Oh, and he did his own stunts as well.Had not Halicki perished during filming of the sequel in 1989 (a water tower fell too early and crushed the car Halicki was driving), he would have been the obvious choice to direct a WORTHY remake of the best car-chasing movie of all times.Car-chase movies were a lot better in the 70's (the Driver ('78) and Cannonball ('76) (no, NOT the Burt Reynolds comedy) for example), with the rare exception of new movies like Ronin. Watch the original Gone in 60 Seconds, and I promise you will look at the 2000 remake in a totally new light."
1,The (second) Most Gawdawful Movie I've Ever Seen,"After watching it three times (It was all they were showing on the China-US and US-Canada flights! Except for one flight where they showed Chicken Run!), I have to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Pretty much the entire point was to glorify car stealing and to show off a busty blonde with blowfish-lips. It was so stupid and boring I never got to the end, every single time I just took off my headphones about half-way through and continued to read Lord of the Rings. When a fourteen-year-old girl would rather read Lord of the Rings (looooong...) than watch a movie, you know that movie must be really really awful."
2,5 star fun movie. 1 star marketing abuse.,"It's not an Oscar winning anything, it's just a sexy, fast, fun movie, that looks good, and a good time killer. It's 5 stars for fun -- not for script or cinematic achievement.I give it a low rating as you are forced to watch several previews before getting to the menu. It's hard enough to click around on the PSP for movies, and yes, you can continue to attempt to skip them, but we should not have to deal with this annoyance. It should not even be an option. I bought the movie. Just put the damn feature film on the disc, along with relevant features, thats it."
4,GOOD MOVIE WITH A GOOD TRANSFER,"YES I KNOW MY OPION OF THIS MOVIE BEING GOOD ISN'T FELT ALL AROUND. IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD HIT BACK IN 2000 WHEN IT CAME OUT AND I WATCHED THE DVD PROBABLY 10 TIMES. THE BLU-RAY VERSION WAS EYE POPPING! THE VISUALS WERE CLEAR AND CRISP. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE VISUALLY WAS GREAT SOUND WAS OK NOT REALLY A BIG UPGRADE. THE COLORS WERE BRIGHT, BOLD, AND DETAILED EVEN DURING THE CHASE AS WELL. IF YOUR A FAN OF THE MOVIE AND HAVE A BLU-RAY PLAYER OF A PS3 THEN UPRGRADE. THE MOVIES ARE STILL A LITTLE PRICEY FOR BLU-RAY BUT THIS IS ONE TI9TLE THATS WORTH IT!!"
4,Entertaining from begging to end full of actiona dn the story is good,I enjoyed this film from start to finish and I cant see why the critics did not like it. The film has a good story and it's full of action. The movie is great for action fans and has some funny moments in it. The acting is alos good in it and it'a good all star cast. The movie is a edge of your seat action movie that will have you hooked from begging to end.
3,Good but not roomy enough...,"This wallet is nice and the leather is great quality. The problem is that is just not ""roomy"" enough. My husband put all his credit cards, which aren't many maybe four, his ID, one check and three bills in it and it would barely close. I know leather streaches but this looked like it was about to bust! So it's good if you want to just keep a couple business cards, a little money and your ID besides that forget about it there's no room!!But overall it is good quality, well made."
5,A classic,This book was influential in shaping my views on church and the christian community as a college student in the 80's. I have now purchased it again for my high school kids to read. You won't be disappointed.
3,"good retelling of the story of Acts, but some mixed feelings","Mr. Edwards does an excellent job of presenting the history of the early church - essentially from the Resurrection through the founding of the church at Antioch. He presents the challenges that faced the church, and introduces us to men like Stephen, Phillip and Barnabas. Unfortunately, the narrative is frequently interrupted by Mr. Edward's comparisons of the early church to the present-day church. While I feel there is merit to Mr. Edwards criticisms of the church today (though some of his complaints are simply anachronisms) the constant interruptions really damage the flow of the story.Overall, I think this book is worth reading, but I think that some of Mr. Edwards other books (e.g. The Silas Diaries) are better."
4,Fascinating Combination of Soap Opera and High Adventure,"This terrific climbing book combines the larger stories of a struggle to climb the ""world's hardest mountain,"" K2, with a smaller soap opera about a very diverse group of people trying to acheive a goal without driving each other crazy.From a distance, one might see a cohesive group of climbers, pulling together through the interminable months-long task of hauling supplies and tents up through a series of ever-higher camps, one step up, and then two steps down. But closer up, Ridgeway describes in fascinating detail, how the expedition dissolved into competing cliques, and how selfishness and teamwork collided. There's even an extra-marital love triangle.While this book is not as much of a page-turner as Into Thin Air, it is one of the finest mountaineering books out there; a must read in this genre."
4,K2 90210...,"The dangers of mountaineering: not only the mountain, but one's fellow climbers. This book exposes all the infighting, whining and petty disagreements that seem to plague many large expeditions.It's not a depressing book, though: by the end, the reader will feel like they've really been there."
5,This book is a must read montaineering book.!,"I rarely read a book twice, but this is one that I couldn't resist picking up again! High drama, with insights into the terrible physical and psychological dangers of mountaineering and the price that must be paid to climb possibly the most difficult mountain in the world. The excellent writing by Rick Ridgeway weaves the interrelationships of climbers with each other, the mountain, and the eventual sacrfices to be the first American team to reach the summit of K2. If you love adventure; want a better understanding of alpine mountaineering; or to see why K2 is probably the most formidable of the great mountains...read this one!"
5,phenomenal,"This is the best non-fiction book I have ever read. It very vividly recreates the camraderie, the fatigue, the infighting, and the sheer passion that are a part of such an expedition. The best chapter perfectly describes the author and a colleague projecting hundred foot shadows on the terrain thousands of feet below as the afternoon sun sets behind the ridge which they are ascending, conveying so unmistakably to the reader why people climb these mountains. I highly recomend this book."
5,History buff,"Gave this gift to a history buff who really liked it because it covered more than one war. A good gift to anyone interested in seafaring battles. Good condition, prompt delivery."
1,Not what it appears to be,Very disappointed in product. The measure height by the knobs on top & width by outer edge of door. Not worth the money for a cheap piece of plastic. I know it says colors vary but the green one I received is a horrible color. I called customer service and not much help. Told me to send it back but I might get th same color again.
5,Fast Delivery and Great Packaging,"The delivery was really fast and the packaging was great to minimize any potential damage. It's a nice unit. I failed to read the dimensions though and it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It's great for a small rabbit or guinea pig sized animal, but my rabbit it BIG so I will be giving this to a friend. I thought about returning it because of the size, and the return looks really easy, but I got lazy and for the price, I just opted to keep it an give it away.I was pleased with everything about this company though."
4,A very comprehensive book,"This book covers all aspects in General Relativity, in a very methodical and in-depth (though readable) way.In order to be the perfect book on General Relativity, it would need only some math appendix (yes, unfortunately, General Relativity requires you to be able to know cutting-edge math).A must-have, if you want to know about the physical and mathematical details of General Relativity."
2,good information,"I found this to be a tough read but the information is good to know, especially if you are working/researching in the work/family area."
4,Cast lost amidst the flowing plot,"This book is another one of those random novels which I stumbled upon in a 2nd book shop and figured I'd give it a shot even before I researched it on Amazon. Being 389 pages or so, you'd think the book would read longer than it actually is. However, the print isn't so small, so the book reads more like 250 page book (that's my impression). I managed to finish this book in a mere 3 sitting mainly because the flow of the plot was quick: it was steady and engrossing! That doesn't happen very often in novels because of one main drawback: a fast plot leaves the cast struggling to gain private characterization in between all the action. And that is exactly where The Cloud fails- a quick plot envelopes the main characters and leaves them unrefined and fairly flat amidst all else that happens. BUT, when it comes to technology and speculation, The Cloud will not disappoint!"
1,"Poor construction, horrible customer service","This watch is very poorly made. I accidentally ""brushed"" by a ceramic countertop and the watch face shattered. The watch stopped working shortly thereafter. I have tried numerous times to contact by email the service department to try to get it repaired. No reply. Recommend to not by this product."
3,Wanted More,"This book turned out to be a good read for, maybe, a book club. I eventually liked the book and at the end I wanted more-wanting to know more about Aisha(Faith), Crystal and Serena. The story started off slow. I didn't really get into it until after about the first 50 pages, but I found it worth the wait.As you read the book you may find out that you can identify in some ways with the characters. I like the style she chose as far as giving the chapters character names instead of simply numbering them. Its as if she gave a different voice for each chapter and you as the reader were to read from that character's viewpoint.My biggest criticism of this book is that sometimes it was hard to follow who was saying what. The story with Crystal and Neil didn't seem thorough enough. The ending from Tameka's viewpoint left you wanting more to the story."
3,"Bummer, I was hoping to be a foreign film connoisseur :(","On the whole, I found this film depressing and strange. I failed to appreciate the ""omnipresence of the cow"" and found some of the scenes gruesome. The beauty of the film escaped me because of the disturbing and disturbed characters. Definitely not an ""entertaining"" movie. This one is strictly for the connoisseur."
3,It wasn't expensive,"It didn't cost much and it shows. The games aren't fun at all, but that is to be expected, however even the meant for children gameboy headphones had issues with the foam ear pads. They ripped very very easily which is concerning as a playful child could rip it and swallow pieces with relative ease. I already ordered replacement ear pads.Aside that, no complaints!"
5,Your child will love this....,I purchased this game for my son for his birthday and he really loved it. He has not put it down since.
4,The greatest film about family since Capturing the Friedmans,"A great film about trading in the suburban dream for the life of the road, only this time with family in tow. Shows you the price you can pay for that freedom too. Fascinating stuff from Mr. Pray (Big Rig, Scratch, Infamy)and totally worth checking out."
4,off the grid,great flick about a family surviving/thriving under the thumb of a strict father while surfing - we should all have such a screwed up childhood
1,GREAT DOCUMENTARY IF I COULD WATCH,"i have watched this in the past and wanted to see it again. Unforfunately I could not because the format was different than what is seen here in the US. The format of the film is (U) for universal, in the US we have NTSC. They aren't compatible. The end."
5,Great,Great overall review of blues from the beginning. This is a wonderful collection and I would suggest this for any collector.
5,For true fans of the Blues,"If you love music and love the Blues, this is a must have for your collection."
2,Repetitious,"I'm a big blues fan but was very disappointed with this series.The problem, to me, is the concept: have movie directors make films about the blues. This leads to trying to come up with some ""plot"" to carry each installment.In striving to come up with a storyline, most of the directors came up with the same one: a contemporary musician (blues guitarist Corey Harris, rapper Chuck D) travels someplace to find his musical roots in some form of the blues (Delta blues, Chicago blues).This repetitive storyline leaves no room for the history of the blues.Another problem is that not only are the storylines repeated, but so are many of the film clips and songs.I do have to single out the episode Clint Eastwood directed about piano players. It was excellent, and the concept (have piano player Eastwood interview and play with legendary pianists) sets it apart from the other episodes.My advice: buy the CDs from the series and skip the video."
1,Ryan: [...],"I`am a big blues fan!! I have been since i was 8 yrs old. I was very excited when i first heard there was going to be a seris on the blues. However, I was very dissopointed in it. Martin was all over the place in the first show. He was talking about Africa Music and then started talking about delta music. He did not go in order of how blues was orginated. If they ever do a blues seris again they need Ken Burns to do it."
3,"Adorable, but bent easily","This is an adorable umbrella, but ours bent very easily. I still haven't given it to my daughter because I am afraid it will break and cut her. The quality was a little flimsy."
3,Seen worse,"This book is exactly what it says it is: A list of lists. Occasionally, the reader is even ""treated"" to a little tidbit explaining the list.Between the lack of supplementary material and the sometimes pathetic lists--The ""Dynamic Duo"" (Batman and Robin) get their own list? and so do the Monopoly properties, as if I couldn't just look at a board--I have to say I was less than impressed.If you're looking to quiz people with trivia, though, it's not bad, I suppose."
2,"Totally, Utterly, and Completely Messed Up!","Alright, we got this book hoping it would help (being the Princeton Review and all)...and it did--a bit. After awhile we started noticing very stupid mistakes every once in a while. It got out of hand when the book proclaimed that 60 times 0.5 was still sixty...and on the fourth practice test there were five mistakes--all very stupid ones. Some parts of questions were actually omitted so it was impossible to do them. For a specific example, on page 213 question six had no real answer. How can you tell from just the picture? Anyway, if you get this book be prepared for many errors (though they were good for laughs, they don't really help when you're studying for exams)."
1,Extemporaneous riff,"My mother-in-law has false teeth. Full set of choppers. Lost them all before she was 20. In the US.Just saying.No one, not even her husband of half a century, has seen her without the teeth in. She gave birth with teeth in!Just saying. I shouldn't make sport. I don't devote much time to dental hygeine beyond brushing once or twice a day. Floss, feh! I'll end up with store-boughts eventually, too, I guess. (But I'll take 'em out to scare door-to-door pests!)"
5,A profound and powerful tribute,"Bagpipe Brothers: The FDNY Band's True Story Of Tragedy, Mourning, And Recovery is the true story New York City's Emerald Society Bagpipe Band, who used their instruments to mourn in the and show their respect at the funerals for the victims of the 9/11 attacks, including the 343 firefighters who died and those who were unearthed from the rubble at ground zero. The band itself lost one of its own from the attacks, as well as the brother of a member; Bagpipe Brothers recounts in vivid detail the emotions, experiences, terrible grief and striving to help any way one can in the wake of tragedy. A profound and powerful tribute to both the lost and the survivors struggling to cope."
4,A Must Read for FDNY Enthusiasts,"This is a great book. A little history on bagpipes, a little history on the FDNY Emerald Society and a front row seat into the post 9-11 world of the FDNY. Having read dozens of books on the topic, Bagpipe Brothers takes me places I haven't seen before. This is a book that will probably pull out in a couple of years to remind what happened to our Country when we were attacked by islamic terrorists.Don't let the 9-11 mosque be built. Fight. Fight. Fight!"
3,Nice if it would come...,"Picked up Bell'Italia in a bookstore. Loved the magazine, couldn't wait to subscribe, and I signed up for two years...It's almost two months later, and I still haven't received my first issue. So, negative-two stars for being late, but otherwise, it's a comprehensive, beautifully-put together mag."
1,"If Y'all Bought This, Y'all Were Ripped Off!!!",How in the sam hell are y'all pricin' this for THREE times MORE than the ladder is worth?!? Are y'all high?
2,Falls apart easy...!,"After we took it out of the box, we discovered that the frame was made from scraps of 1"" X 4"" glued together instead of continuous 1 X 4 construction of the rectangular frame.When we installed the ladder, the frame broke in half, hurting a worker at the jobsite.Be careful when framing these in, as to build it better than they give it to you!J Jackson"
5,Super Attic Ladder,"I got this attic ladder on line, cuz the price was right along with free shipping, and far better than anything the Home Depot or Lowes had to offer. My son and I installed it in a couple hours and it works just fine."
3,Sloppy construction,"The stairs fir well...went in easy. However, when I pulled the stairs down I found one of the ladder rungs was riveted into place upside down at the factory! I guess I 'll live with it because I don't want to take the old one down and replace it !! It just shows you good help is tuff to find!"
5,Excellent - Child's attention kept with video and music,"Our daughter is now 14 months old, and she has loved this video since she was 4 months in age. When she was in her bouncy seat, she would rock the seat back and forth to the visuals and music. Now, she rocks back and forth on her feet. When she is not feeling well or is restless, we are able to use this video to calm her down and provide focus. The video always puts a smile on her face. Each color has a specific genre of music playing with the visuals. The music styles range from funky, rock-like tunes, country, blues, and classical pieces. I also highly recommend the Animals and Letters videos in this six video set."
5,No Hollywood movie here,If you like Hollywood movies -- DON'T Watch THIS.If you are SICK and TIRED of formulated Hollywood movies with predictable story lines - endings - plots - and so on//You will LOVE this movie
5,a story without a cause,"Reminiscent of Greek tragedy, except that the fullness of the Greek tragedies was the completion of cycle, here it is the restoration of balance. In a belief system that does not include a linear cause and effect progression to an eschatological justice, this is the 'just' and 'meaningful' and therefore the 'happy' 'ending'; but even those who believe in it like the king are unhappy in the culmination. Everyone else, struggling more and more manically for a different meaning and a different happiness, are simply trapped in the inevitability of cosmic equilibrium: rebellion is futile, nothing can be changed, things will only adjust elsewhere to compensate and return to patterned balance. This does not answer to anyone's humanity; and even the king does -unfortunately considering the compensations he must make- have some humanity. A superbly executed, incredibly well acted, and very haunting film."
3,Mixed nutts,"Picture is good, not great (have seen better in a lot of hd-dvd's / blu-ray's)Sound is good, very good accully. (uncompressed PCM)Movie, well for me its a big dissapointment. So booooring. Was expecting more action, more typical asian fighting.To summon,Picture : 4/6Sound : 5/6Movie : 2/6"
2,Not that good,"Could've been a lot lot better, not enough action scenes to keep you interested. They tried to make it too dramatic and it fails in that department. Sorry...Either Hero or HOFD are way better than this."
1,Okay...perhaps it does deserve 1 star !,"There is no doubt, the cinematography is superb, but what happened to the story? It drag and drag and those looking for a chinese kung fu film, will be very disappointed. Instead it had some very nice scenes that drag and drag for no reason, other than it was a nice cinematrography, but did nothing to contribute to the story. The story was ridiculous and don't understand what audience they were trying to appeal to, because they left nothing for anyone to relate or attach to. I rarely ever say a film was a bit of a waste of time, but in fact don't ever recall ever sayiing that, but this film was so disppointing. I like a good story with my movies, this story was just nothing short of lame."
1,superficial skin deep junk,I used to have great respect for its director Zhang until he started to make big budget martial arts fantasy films. I am sorry to say this film is a superficial skin deep junk. Visually it is stunning but its story line is completely senseless. It is as if the plot is an after thought for the sake of the visual effects Zhang envisions. It claims to be in the Tang dynasty but the only thing which might has something to do with the era is the low-cut women dresses. Yet even that is way overdone. What a disgrace!
2,"Warmed Over ""Dynasty"" Episode with delusions of Grandeur","Although a few of the other review allude to the weak plot, I am surprised no one has noticed that the plot of this film has more in common with an episode of ""Dynasty"" with Chow Yun Fat in the ""Blark Carrington"" role and Gong Li as ""Alexis Colby"" - and it seems that every hack-kneed soap opera plot devise is used - the upstairs/downstair romance, the wide who resents her over baring husband and has an affair with her much sexier step-son, the first wife thought to be dead who shows as the star witness of the nurder trial (oops!, that last one was from ""Dynasty""). The film is beautiful to look at but I became very ""aware"" of how much CGI effects were used to create the thousands of soliders.Then of course the plot borrows heavily from Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" and ""Macbeth"" as well..."
3,"beautiful, but boring","As others have stated, the sets are very colorful and intricate. But the CGI of the palace is lacking and the plot is tedious at best. What little fighting in the movie is ruined by cartoonish ninja-like assassins. Gong Li is a beauty, but it was tough to sit through this movie. Definitely not as good as House of Flying Daggers, Hero, or Crouching Tiger."
4,Visual Extravaganza,"A very good movie with lots of beautiful colored scenes. Honesty and betrayal, love and treachery are given center stage. The visual extravaganza of this production is along the lines of ""Hero"". It's eye candy."
5,Just fabulous!,"I recently saw this twice at the cinema and just 'had' to get it on DVD. I am a fan of Crouching Tigers, Flying Daggers and Hero, but this film far surpasses either of these, although I loved each for different reasons. Golden Flowers is beautiful to watch. The colour used in the sets and costumes blew me away. Absolutely stunning. A fantastic film to watch for this alone, but the story is also great. Chow Yun Fat who I also adore is particularly 'nasty' in this film and very hard to like, which shows how well he acts. It is a definate 'must' to see."
4,Wonderfully entertaining. Great plot!,"This DVD carried with it a great plot, great design, and great acting. The only downfall I would have to point out was purchasing a movie which does not speak my language (English). Although it translates throughout the movie--I found it to be distracting while trying to watch the many scenes (action packed), and read at the same time. Uck!I had to watch it three times in order to fully enjoy it throughly."
3,"good color, so-so story","the BD movie video and audio are fine, story so-so. if you know director Zhang Yimou, it is another same movie/story just like ""House of Flying Daggers"",""Hero"". i think he pays too much attention to coloring, not the story. 5* for color, 4.5* for video,4* for audio,3* for story. 3* for acting."
3,Not up to the hype.....,"I am a fan of the Asian artisitic movie style. What draws me to this style of movie is the culture, colors and often time sound effects. This movie did not have a lot of aciton through out the movie. They had big scenes towards the end and an ending that left you unsatisfied. This is the first Asian movie that did not leave me fully satsified and enriched at the end. I also love A/V...and this Blu Ray did not have great PQ and NO AUDIO ADVANTAGE in english. Only the Chinese version has the PCM sound available. This should have been a DVD 5 dollar sale item."
3,The filming is wonderful,"The story itself is interesting a soap opera type story in an oriental setting of a king having problems in his family. This guy having an affair, the Queen being poisoned by the Emperor, the sons fighting over succession and so on.I also found the different characters interesting. Overall they came together well. Much of the acting was good. In particular I did like Liu Ye performance!The filming was good too. The visuals were top.There were plenty of actors, with great costumes and some of the decor of the rooms can only be described as fantastic. They must have spent a fortune on it.What I did not like was the battle scenes. It is not that they are unreal that put me off as I am used to Asian movies. It was the scenes seemed like a ballet not a battle. You don't need color and costumes for these. Nor did I find the martial arts interesting surprising considering the director."
3,Disappointing.,"This movie was visually absolutely stunning. The costumes and sets were incredible, almost overwhelmingly saturated with intense color. However, the plot was not what the previews made it out to be. The previews made it look like an intense movie about a people's rebellion, filled with epic battles and whatnot. However, the movie had little to offer as far as battle scenes go, and the actual plot (scandelous as it may be) left much to be desired. Slow-moving, stagnant characters, dissatisfying ending. I would only recommend a rental on this one."
2,Ninjas in the Tang dynasty setting,"The movie evidently pretends to be a Ran-type awe-inspiring masterpiece, but where Akira Kurosawa'a facade of breathtaking scenery and colorful constumes takes a second place to a compelling message of the film, the Curse of the Golden Flower really has no message at all, just a succession of unrealistic, ahistorical scenes cast in such bright colors as to pain the eye. I think the movie stands a chance as some kind of a surrealist curiosity; for now, I shall assign it to a place of honor in the basement, never to be heard of again."
2,Eye Candy Facade,"The Curse of the Golden Flower stars great Chinese actors Gong Li and Chow Yun-Fat. Psychedelic in its opulence, the setting of the Forbidden City during the Tang Dynasty (900 A.D.) and the costumes of the cast of thousands, are as decadent as eating wedding cake for a week.Yet the plot is as thin as an Oriental screen. Not intending to be a spoiler, like most modern Chinese movies, e.g. Raise the Red Lantern, also starring Li, the ending of ""Flower"" is depressing, everyone dies, and evil prevails.Set during the Chrysanthemum Festival, held the ninth day of the ninth month of every year, the emperor, empress, princes, and various courtiers poison each other and plot coups."
2,Weird... Strange... and a Little Annoying,"Good look into pre-century Chinese custom and beautiful to look at, but that's about it. So much over-kill in every way: manner of dress, emotions, the actors' lines, plot... everything. Curse of the Golden Flower has nowhere near the elegance and/or grace of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Hero. Rent it."
4,Beautiful but slow,"This is one of the most beautiful movies you are ever going to watch. Must be seen on a big screen. You'll find yourself asking in the middle of the movie, is that real - how did they do that - and just wow. The special features has a documentary that shows,indeed, most of what you see is real. They could only make this in China.The problem is the plot gives you lots of time to ask how did they do that as their isn't more action. This really is a soap opera and not in the same genre of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. I wanted more action and more fighting but I am a guy."
3,"Entertaining, but ultimately dreary","This was an unusual and dark film directed by Yimou Zhang which follows the manipulations of evil emperor Ping and his victimized second wife. The costumes, cinematography and scenery were beautiful and sumptuous, but the story was dark and disturbing. Emperor Ping has been slowly poisoning his second wife. He forces her to drink medicinal tea- which is posioned and is slowly driving her mad and ruining her health. The empress herself is having an affair with one of Ping's sons (not incestuous since she is his stepmother, but still slightly squicky), and she has been trying to have the emperor dethroned. All three sons including her own, slowly become embroiled in the plot.I found myself engrossed in the story, and wanted the empress to succeed in her plot to have Ping ousted, since he was cruel and evil. I found the ending dreary, and a lot left unresolved. I probably wouldn't watch it again, but the costuming and were well done."
4,"It was beautiful to watch, but a bit too over the top with drama","We loved to watch the cinamatography was amazing, one of the best I have seen in some time, worth watching, just a bit soap opera-ish. I love Asian artistic movies and this is a touch more dramatic. A bit bloody, but over fun to watch."
3,"This is a Sad, Sad movie!","Talk about how movie endings could ruin the whole story! The movie started off so well, with a vivid peek on how ancient imperial chinese decorum ensued. I think that was very well portrayed. The movie never gave a hint of sparing a nickle or dime in its making. From the grandiose entourage to the elaborate fight scenes that makes you go WHAT! It also showed nobility, courage, and all the benevolent make-belief values do-gooders colloquially say. Everything was spoiled by the fact that an evil, manipulative, cunning, heartless, morally bereft, and malignantly shrewd emperor/father, free from any remorse whatsoever, saw to the demise of his own family. It's eerie to imagine someone close to you capable of doing that. So very sad!"
3,A Chinese Hamlet?,"Visually, the movie is stunning. As for the plot, I found it more than a bit reminiscent of ""Hamlet."" There's royal intrigue, incest, murder, and tragedy worthy of the Bard (although not the prose). Although it is a bit slow, I found the plot more sophisticated than one usually finds in this genre of ""martial arts"" movies (I'm not even sure that's the right category for it...)Overall, I found it interesting enough to justify watching although I was a bit disappointed (I was hoping for another ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""). Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
3,Costumes do not make a good movie,"So very pretty, such a let down. Hero and House of Flying Daggers were both so incredible that it was hard to believe it was from the same director."
4,Something for everyone!,"This was such an enjoyable film - I should have given it 5 stars...maybe. It was a beautiful film for the gals and enough special effects and combat for the guys. The story is intriging. And, the idea is so complex the kids can be in the room!!!!!!!! I passed this on to friends but when I get it back I want to watch it again!"
3,"Great Album, Bad Vendor","First off, I love the album - it's full of chill grooves from the Samurai Champloo series that anyone with an appreciation for quality production would love. My only gripe is that the jewel case came a little tattered, which I would overlook with a used product, but not so much with something branded as ""New"" with a fifty dollar price tag. The music was entirely worth it, but having cracks and chips in the case was really disappointing."
4,Irish dance steps,"I bought this DVD because I'm having a traditional Irish music band perform at my wedding. I'm not a natural dancer and needed to learn some basic steps. I was afraid the Jean Butler DVD would be too dificult for me. This DVD is perfect for my needs. The steps are very simple but will allow me to move to the music. It's also a good workout, with all the bouncing up and down. I gave it 4 stars because the production is a bit amateur. The editing is poorly done in places. If you already know Irish dancing, this DVD is way too simple for you. For the rest of us with an interest in Irish culture, it's great."
5,Hilarious and affectionate parody of 'dreamboat' cars,"Bruce McCall used to work as a commercial illustrator specializing in automotive illustration. This caricature of period advertising is a delightful addition to his incredibly out of print ZANY AFTERNOONS.I believe that Bruce McCall really loves the overdesigned, overhyped monster cars of the Fifties and Sixties. I love his wicked parodies of the copy that used to be found in auto ads.Now available with special Individually Bound Pages!Highly recommended."
3,Well it almost came close...,"I enjoyed every second of this book, but it didn't sit well with me in the end. I think that the two main characters we're meant to be together, that I believe, but somehow things just didn't seem to fit in the end. It's like doing a math problem and doing some of the work wrong but still getting the right answer. How did it happen? I get this feeling with this book. The main characters got their happy ending, but I don't get how it happened still. Like I said it was an enjoyable book, but it was flawed."
2,10 minutes for $10.99,"This video is a well produced sermon vignette that adds some emotional resonance to the book.Hardly essential and at 10 minutes isn't really worth the price.If they packaged all the Chazown videos together for $10.99 or even $15.99 it might be worth it, but unfortunately that is not the case. Skip them and just read the book."
5,BUEN REGALO NAVIDEÑO,"The production is very attractive to children. My 5 and 7 years old have watched the different stories over and over. Before going to school they used to watch useless TV, with this videos, the Bible stories are sinking in and giving us lots of opportunity to talk of the History of the People of God... a great tool for the non-reading ages.The stories stick to the Bible version, not distorted or invented... It's the Bible illustrated... and it shall never pass!"
3,40-foot ladder,"The first ladder came in on time but had a big bend in it. It was pretty hard to get hold of someone at amazon. Finally figured it out & they set up a return pick up & give me a new ladder. This took about two weeks! The shipper was even less impressive. By the time I got the new ladder the job my company was doing was on the last day. And on top of that this new ladder had a small bend in it & a small bend on a rung. But I had to have a ladder now so I accepted it. Pretty dissapointed with Amazon, Werner ladder, & ABF Shipping."
3,shipping nightmare,Product arrived damaged. replacement for it arrived in worse condition then first. I was able to make one good product from the damaged two. Shipment was protected from supplier but freight carriers really messed them up. The last freight carrier was very good andconscientious.
4,good product. late shipping,"The ladder is good but came through with minor shipping damage. Delivery was a couple of days late and I had to threaten cancellation to get it. The shipment charges were refunded. Thanks and regards, Jim"
3,Old Wine In New Bottles,"I guess I was pleasantly surprised by this recording as, personally, I still use Maiden Voyage as a reference point for HH's work. The most fascinating thing for me is what the title hints at: putting new context on some well known pop songs. Listening to the record felt a bit like enjoying some old vintage contained in what looks like new bottles! Worth purchasing and giving a good spin. >> Arthur A. Madonsela >> South Africa."
4,sizzlin',This album sizzles as it moves and grooves and shakes and bakes. There may be some 'stupid arranging tricks' but the blowin' is fine and that is where it is at. Herbie is finally free on this after so many outings where he wasn't goin' Up-Town like he used to.Can you digIt?
2,Bought it then resold it,"Bought it one day and resold it within a month after trying my darndest to appreciate it. The covers of the Henley and Cobain tunes are the most moving pieces on the album. ""Norwegian Wood"" is atrocious elevator fare. This was a well-conceived but very disappointing and highly underdeveloped effort. My guess is that he spent no more than a day or two on the project before he hit the studio. Also, Hancock is simply not the introspective and engaging pianist on this album (except on New York Minute) that he is capable of being. The freshness of his ""Inventions and Dimensions,"" over 30 years old, makes this album sound as stale and bland as it is. I don't think the limitations of the compositions are as much a problem (although, the pure melodic aspects of rock compositions could be a problem) as Hancock's lack of will to really stretch out and develop the material."
3,New Standard.......???,"I mean - it's Herbie, so it can't be really bad, but.........""New Standard"" seems a bit optimistic.I have never heard so many errors in H. Hancock playing, especially over a comparatively easy piece like ""Love Is Stronger Than Pride"".He completely screws it at 01.46 - 01.53, hits wrong keys again at 02.04 and some other places of the tune. I was a bit shocked.Also, in terms of John Scofield, I somewhere read that since 1998 he is clean and sober. ""New Standard"" is from 1996, and on this album, he definitely was clean and sober too, but in a bad way. Can't remember having heard Sco playing so flabby and dull on any other record to date.M. Brecker on Sax, D. Holland on bass and J. DeJohnette are cool and play great, though."
1,why oh why?,Why was this CD released? None of the songs work well when translated to Hancock's Jazz style.
5,Excellent Jazz,"This CD has rapidly become one of my favorites. Herbie and company succeed masterfully at fulfilling the ""standard"" potential of these popular tunes. Very well arranged and performed, and the solos are outstanding!"
1,Not as good as earlier editions,"The current edition is not like older editions. Much longer and less useful. Harder to find information on topics, which is the point of a reference."
2,Not A Growth Repair Item.,There is no regrowth what so ever - however I don't think this item claims regrowth. Does not color green like the bottle displays on the label. It does color somewhat - it adheres to some burn spots better than others color wise - I guess depending on the type of grass - If you just want to camoflage the burn spots some what - then this is the product for you. I have two dobermans and I need gallons and gallons of this stuff to even try to attempt to cover all the spots - this stuff goes quick if you have a lot of spots.
3,Lawn spot repair better than my brown spots!!,"I adopted 2 dogs after relanscaping my yard. I was horrified to see the brown spots on my beautiful new lawn; I use lawn spot repair and although it does not regrow the lawn, it make the color somewhat even, much better than looking at the brown spots!!! I use a rake to ""fluff up"" the brown spots so when I spray, it covers the dead grass more evenly. I find it needs to be applied on dry grass and then let it dry. I revisit those spots once a week or so and my lawn is now just fine!"
1,SPOT REPAIR,"Does not work. After ""spray painting"" the yellow spots so they're green, no regrowth has occured after three weeks and the green die washed off almost immediately. Don't waste your money."
5,It Works!,"I have 3 big dogs and they kill lots of grass in my yard. I have been using Simple Solutions Lawn Spot Away for several years and love it. It works! As long as you are not too close to see the slight difference in color, it is worth spraying because from the patio where we all sit, we can look at the grass after I spray Simple Solutions and it is all green. And the grass does grow back pretty fast. I like the product and my gardner likes the product. It is just difficult to find it in the stores."
3,pestle,"The pestel arrived quickley and no damage with shipping. Is good quality/workmanship. The picture does not represent the size therefore, this pestle was much larger than I thought it would be. I was looking for one much smaller than this. I perhaps can use it for another purpose or larger quantities to crush. Suggestion: mention a size or volume it will hold: tsp, tbs, oz, cups, ect. Thank you"
4,A neat little book,"Enjoyed this book and would recommend it to puppy owners.Spending just a few minutes each day will go a long way towards having a well trained pet, which greatly decreases the chances of behavior problems in the future.Shawn Messonnier DVMauthor, the Allergy Solution for Dogs, 8 Weeks to a Healthy Dog, and the award-winning The Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Catswww.petcarenaturally.com(...)"
5,Always a delight to read...,"As a book store owner, I get to become jaded to fiction. I get to look at every new book that hits the shelves, and 95% of the time I am simply not impressed. Harry Turtledove is one of the few authors I own everything by. From his Fantasy writing, to his Alternative History books, he is solid reading. f you are looking for something different, Harry Turtledove is your man. In this his latest book in the WWI series, he has put together a book, I personally wish never ended. I have become attached to several of the characters, and hate waiting for the next book. Yes Harry does at times seem to follow the actual events too much, but then again if he just went off into the blue sky, it would lose its ability to be believed. All of the things in his books are believable, as are his characters. I recommend him highly, for history and fictions readers alike.."
4,Pure Entertainment,"If I wanted to read an accurate history, I'd check out the reference section. While Mr. Turtledove's premises may be a little thin (I sincerely doubt the CSA could have won the Civil War even if McClelland hadn't had Lee's plans for his first invasion of the North), he tells a very interesting story, carrying it to it's logical conclusion given the ""facts"". He personalizes aspects of the story while effectively tying these aspects into the big piture. While following several different sub-stories as they weave together may be a little much at times, he leaves me always wanting more, and I found this installment in the series the hardest to put down yet. I can't wait to see how WWII plays out in this alternate reality (maybe aliens will show up?)."
4,General Custer ends up the hero!,"Breakthroughs wraps up the story of WWI as fought on American soil and at risk of giving away the ending: the US wins. Turtledove brings closure to most of the stories he has woven into the war. Some end well, others in tragedy. There were some very interesting twists and turns, not the least of which is that General Custer turns out to be the hero of the war. He also sets many of the cast up for their part in the American Empire series which follows. The main complaint I have about Breakthroughs (and the entire series in general) is Turtledove's need to rehash the core point of each story as he switches back and forth between them. In theory one could read any of the books independently, but I don't think he should have wasted the space rehashing every little thing that happened in the first two novels over and over again."
4,Good read,The whole series (9 books) is very readable and supplied me with hours of fun. The books have their lengths but also moments where you can't put them down even though it's 3 a.m.
3,"Good series, but tires you if you continue","My review is the same for all books of the series. Decent story, a little slow, but also one of the most annoying series becuase he repeats things over and over. Examples are that southern tobacco is way better that northern and northern smokes taste terrible. Also,this black guy was former butler who worked for this white rich lady and was taught to talk like an educated white man and details about his time there. Many more things like this, so just about anytime a soldier smokes in these books( about 100 times) you have to hear about the tobacco, etc. Each character has something told about them over and over and over and over and over, see how annoying that is. These irritating things are just minor pains right now, it continues though and is very tiring to read."
2,drawn out novel,"This was the first time I had read an alternate history novel. The idea behind it was fine yet Turtledove switched so much between differnt stories that no one story had much depth and feeling to it. The mini stories, though trying to get a feel from all sides of a war, were superfically set up. There were some characters i wanted Turtledove to go more depth in and others i felt he could have elimintated. The ending of the novel was were the climax was for most characters. I also didnt like how at the end a lot of characters were left hanging. Overall I wasnt that pleased with the way Turtledove wrote about the experiences of war."
2,Colonization with funny hats,"For so promising a premise, the results are quite disappointing. Mr. Turtledove is clearly writing for the sake of quantity rather than quality. Just about every character wrapped himself in a blanket ""more from the bugs than the cold."" Cliches are repeated constantly by the same characters, by different characters, even by characters in his colonization series. In fact, if you've read both series you've recognized several of the same characters existing in each. The book is not a good piece of writing, but is an even poorer example of editing. Isn't it the editor's job to catch so many retreads of the same paragraphs? This is definitely a library book, not one that I would lay out my own cash for."
3,"Good plot and characters, bad storytelling","Harry Turtledove certainly knows his history, and his characters have the instincts and motivations of real people. But his writing skills are deteriorating. This would have been a far better story if it had been told largely through the events and the actions of the characters in response to those events. Instead, a lot of the book was spent telling us the thoughts and philosophies of the characters. Turtledove has always had this tendency, but his recent books are worse. And he tells the audience many things which are obvious from context. If his editor had cut the book by 20%, it would have been an improvement. I rate the book 4 stars for plot and characters, but only 2 stars for writing skills."
2,plant order,I was looking for a specific plant I'd seen in a magazine and thought this was it. What arrived was not like the picture or like the magazine but has been an interesting plant nonetheless. I was expecting one big rosette (like pictured) and what I got was more like a miniature tree that has been difficult to keep alive but it's still going.
3,Historically valuable but plain,"I do enjoy a good story, and Zlateh is full of them, with nice drawings by Maurice Sendek. But they do get kind of drab. These aren't stories that are overly funny or have an intellectual twist at the end that I was expecting. These are stories of a culture and they capture the strengths and weaknesses of that culture and do so quite wonderfully. Just be warned, the cultural quirks and expectations of the stories in this book will receive less appreciation from our technology-loving culture than they deserve. The book itself is a quick and comfortable read and has the potential for an excellent bed-time book for 4-8 year olds."
2,dissapointed,this case arrived without the keys to lock case after several attemps to get a set of keys from shipper I gave up and decided to just keep the case without the keys I am still very angry
4,Fascinating intro to F1 technology,"I'm a big F1 fan and enjoy listening to Matchett's commentary on the Speed F1 broadcasts. He's intelligent, well-spoken and has a deep base of knowledge of the F1 universe. This book literally picks Matchett's brain for every scrap of knowledge about the mechanics and science (and art) of Formula 1 racecar design. It's built around a somewhat affected premise of a long airplane flight conversation with some fictional F1 fans. This is the only part of the book that feels a little weak. He doesn't write fiction as well as facts, and his new-found friends come off sounding like a group of wealthy British twits. One even asks Steve ""What say you, old man?"". Please tell me no one still says things like that.I still strongly recommend this book. I learned a lot about F1 car design and the science of racing in general, as well as some interesting background on the people involved in the sport."
3,Good intro for new F1 fans,"The setting is rather contrived at best (airport lounge for Concorde and a collection of rich, boozing, but technically uninformed F1 fans). The information delivered is adequate, and there are a number of good tidbits, such as the challenges of creating carbon fibre brake discs and the relative advantages/costs thereof.For those familiar with F1, there is not all that much there, but for those who have an interest but lack much of the technical background to appreciate the level of ferocious competition, it can be a good eye-opener. The informal, chatty style fits the contrived scene."
4,A great romp through the arcane world of F1,"Covering all aspects of the modern F1 car from nose cone to diffusers, Matchett serves up a masterful analysis of what's in an F1 car and why. Couched in the form of a chance encounter with F1 enthusiasts, his artful descriptions of the hyper technology and old fashioned elbow grease needed to extrude the final magnificent result are a pleasure to read.To the enthusiast, this book will be a page turner. To the newbie, an approachable, non-condescending, very informative read.However, the travelogue introduction and conclusion are a bit of an indulgence. They do, however, help the reader get to know Steve the person, reminding us that he is in some ways a regular guy who eats at diners in Manhattan and sips coffee in Paris, in addition to being at the pinnacle of the motorsport-journalist world, and enshrined in F1 hall-of-fame-of-the-mind for his role in the 1994 World Championship."
2,Dissapointed,Although the writing is fine the technical content and graphics in this book are very 'lightweight'. There is nothing here that a casual enthusiast who reads F1 news stand magazines would not already know. Not recommended.
4,Steve Matchett's The Chariot Makers,Strange the way the book is written around Steve meeting a few F-1 fans in an airport. Nice reading but I miss illustrations!
1,Not satisifed,The card reader comes in retail packaging and totally lacks instructions on how best to put 68 types of cards into 4 slots. It did read an SD card successfully. The micro usb plug on the usb cord broke after 1 use.
5,"iam happy with this card reader,thank u",thank you for usb 2.0 card reader/writer.it work well and fast to my picture r real good thank you again.
2,Poor quality,"I can get it to read SD cards, but I bought it to read my CF's and it won't read a single one. My experience is in line with others. Go check out similar reviews on newegg.com."
3,Card Reader good,This product works well as long as you don't plug it into the Monitor USB ports. Try using the Computer USB ports directly. For some reason the computer and the device get confused when trying to use the monitor USB ports. The 64-1 is deceptive. It just reads four types but different brands.
5,Works well,"So far I only use this for SM and SD cards, but it installed (USB) quickly, easily and reads the cards I need read."
4,VERY MARIA...,"Funny smart comedy, with the multiple voices that are her trademark. Some of the bits are better than others, but overall, really good set. I've listened to it over and over, and it's still funny."
2,Omits precapitalistic slave societies,"Slavery was widespread through the Inca and Aztec cultures. Islam embraces slavery without reservation, it is expressly approved in the Koran. Segal documents the fact that 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their home by Islamic traders from 700 A.D. to 1900 B.C. Mohammed left many pages of directions to SLAVEHOLDERS on how to handle their slaves. The Ummyad dynasty of Islamic rulers castrated male Black African slaves and used them in battle between 700 A.D. and 1200 A.D.By the way, where does one find a successful, stable, democratic non-capitalistic society? Planned economies don't work."
2,Definately not worth the price,"I love to sing in the shower, so my grandparents decided that this would make a good Hanukkah gift for me. Unfortunately, I can only use it once or twice before I have to change the batteries. When you first put in batteries, both the CD player and radio work great. But then, after a shower or two, the radio will play about 30 seconds of a song before decaying into an annoyingly loud ""boom boom boom"" noise. The CD player will either skip or not start at all. The only remedy I've found to this problem is changing the batteries, which are still practically at full power. Now, I must say that I ""abuse"" this device...I use it daily, leave it in the shower, and probably expose it to numerous cleaning chemicals, but from reading the other reviews I have determined that my problems might not stem only from this behavior. Bottom line: Don't get it if you plan to use it more than a few times,"
2,It works...,I just got one of these on sale. The clock died 1 day after it was placed in the shower. The radio itself works fine. Next time I am going to try and get a digital tuner.
1,Hunk of Junk,Bought this player used it twice and now it doesn't work. I took great care of it. Every time I put a CD in it it reads no disc. It's not the batteries. Wish I would have saved the receipt so I could send this hunk of junk back.
2,Semi water proof.,"Had this nowhere near direct water, but steam seems to have ruined it just fine. Lasted a few months before dying. Not very water tight at all."
3,Best for older kids,"The movie was good, but because of some intense scenes, it's best for older kids. There is a scene where a man kills a poisoned dog with a shovel, to put it out of its suffering. ( The shovel is shown only shoulder high, but it's still pretty intense for a little kid to see.) Also, there's a scene where a dog is shot and is shown bleeding and lame. The dog doesn't die, but it looks like he might. So if you don't think your child can handle scenes like these, you better not get this movie - or wait until they're older."
3,Good sing along,This is a good sing along DVD although I would have to say that the Disney Campout DVD is better.
3,"Not as good as I remember, but still fun","This is similar to other sing along videos I remember on VHS, but there is no bouncing ball. It's all color changing words. That makes the words harder to sing along with, unless you already know all the words.This one is totally 80s, but it is still very Disneyland. It looks like the same place, though some of the rides aren't there anymore. It just makes you think it didn't change that much in the past 30 years, though I am sure the price of admission has greatly changed!"
5,Mandatory feedback sucks,"The product is excellent. However, being required to type a certain amount of words really does suck. It does not encourage me to provide effective feedback."
5,Disneyland Fun,"We all wish that we could take the magic of Disneyland home after a visit. This singalong DVD captures the most popular rides and adds songs that children can sing (words are on the screen). The DVD is professionally done and the DVD is first class. Originally released on VHS, this DVD is a wonderful addition to the family's Disney library collection."
4,kids favorite,"I had to update my old VHS version since my older kids and younger kids love this video. It's a little dated, but still a family favorite."
3,"Great Scenes, But Songs Could Be Better","I purchased this DVD for my 3-year-old in preparation for a trip to Disney this summer. She loves watching it - and it does a great job of showing the rides and costumed characters of Disneyland. My only complaint is that most of the songs are geared more toward being an ad for Disneyland than being familiar sign along type songs. ""It's a Small World"" - perfect. ""Walk Right Down the Middle of Main Street USA"" - not so much. I would have much preferred more familiar tunes. But, overall, worth the money."
5,Best theme park sing-a-long!,"My 4 year old LOVES this sing a long! He's watched it over and over since he was 2.The Walt Disney World ones aren't as good though. While this one focuses more on the characters, with the kids/child actors in the background, the WDW ones are the opposite, and the end result is a bunch of kids hammin' it up for the camera. In fact, on this Disneyland Fun one, there are several numbers where it's just the characters, and no kids at all! Plus, it's really fun to see the park in it's ""glory days"" state - pre-new Tomorrowland (pre-Pressler, for your Disneyland philes).I would even recommend this for ANY big Disneyland fan, young, or old."
5,Hasn't changed a bit,This was my favorite video/sing along as a child. I recently bought it for some little cousins and was pleased to find that it is still exactly the same as it was in the 80s. Obviously Disneyland has changed quite a bit since this was filmed but its still a lot of fun. I definitely recommend it to any disney fan or small kids.
2,Song 10 Rocks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is great the songs are good #10 is my favorite. Well to some little kids Grim Grinnig Ghosts might be scary or bother them but it's not very scary it just shows Disney Villins. Such as Dead Oak Trees, The Evil Queen after she turned old [Snow White],the Big Bad Wolf [Three Little Pigs],Captin Hook [Peter Pan] ,Donold Duck under a sheet [unknown],The Evil Queen [Sleeping Beauty],and monsters in side the Hunted Mantion.Any way you shold get this if your child likes this see my Thomas the Tank Engine Revews. and when they get older get them Power Rangers."
2,Not what I expected...,"In reading comments and reviews, i thought this the perfect sing along for my 1 yr old. Basically, this was a 'commerical' for Disneyland. I thought it would be more cartoonish for the young ones........not what I expected at all."
1,Extended Disneyland/world commercial,I was rather surprised about the content of this video. This seemed to be one long advertisement for Disney theme parks. The scenes show more theme park attractions than the Disney characters themselves.
5,One fantastic Disneyland sing along!,I bought this sing along for my 18 month old daughter and she just loves it. It takes place in Disneyland and features all the classic characters. I remember watching this video about 14 years ago with my little brother and he liked it just as much back then. Now I am sharing the same Disney joy with my little one.
2,Good if you go to Disneyland,This is only good if you're going or have gone to Disneyland on a trip. It's old and has a scary song with ghosts and witches.
1,Are you kidding?,"I can't believe this got so many good reviews. I have an old, now-discontinued Disney Sing along VHS that my daughter loves, so I bought this one. It is completely awful. The other video I have has scenes from the actual movies, which is really cool. This one might as well be an advertisement for Disney World.They should pay us to watch it! Not only that, but the fact that it is live-action with super cheesy kid actors and characters in costumes really dates it. I have to admit my 2-year old doesn't really notice the problem (yet), but it is God-awful to watch along with her. In fact, I have hidden it. Get a different sing-along!"
4,Fun for kids!,My 2 year old daughter loves this DVD. She marches and dances and sings along with it! We are looking forward to taking her to Disneyland this fall so she can see it all in person. The only drawback is that it is from the early 1990s and a few attractions featured in the video are no longer at Disneyland.
1,Not Configured Correctly,I needed a null modem adaptor to configure my switches and got excited that I could finally do my job when this came in the mail. But after my laptop wouldn't recognize the switch I realized the adaptor had the wrong pin out
1,Fake item,"I received my mini null modem adapter only to find an impostor in its place. What I received was labeled as ""mini null modem adapter"" but was nothing more than a straight though plug. And unlike in the picture mine had pin 9 intact."
3,Perhaps it is good for research,"I was very interested in Dean Acheson after reading about Truman. The letters are fantastic insight into the key events of Dean's life, as told through actual letters. These primary sources are excellent for research, but poor for entertainment."
2,A misleading title,"This book actually doesn't maintain promises suggested by its title. After having read it, nobody will be able to implement any Extranet. The book doesn't hurt, but is simply an overview (rather general and lacking useful references) for newcomers willing to be introduced to Internet and its more or less secure application. If you consider that the author is (or was when writing the book) Compaq World Wide Marketing Manager, you can easier understand the book's feel and why the title happened to be misleading."
2,Seems to me...,"...that Mr. Neruda must be rolling in his grave, and not just at these ungainly translations of Mr. Bellitt's, but at the fact that his worst nightmares about the fundamental pettiness of the human spirit are borne out when folks below like the reader from New York turn a democratic, public forum into a platform for their own personal vendettas. Worse still, when they are too cowardly to identify themselves. Grow up, anonymous reader from New York. It heartens me to think that in the end, Neruda would end up chuckling at us all here; but at least some of us TRY.For much better english Neruda translations, try William O'Daly's (Copper Canyon Press).Peace."
2,Poor translation,"As someone trying to read Neruda for the second time, I was surprised that I could recognize that the translation was poor. I had only read five of his other poems, and somehow after reading three poems from this volume I knew something was amiss. The translations were more confusing than the Spanish, and my spanish is poor. In many instances the translator chose words that were unnecessarily complex to convey something that could be expressed more simply and clearly in English and still remain true to the author's original words. The only reason I logged onto Amazon.com was to see if the reviews also cited poor translation as a problem with the volume, so I would know I was not just a poor reader."
3,The translation is somewhat shoddy,"All i can say about this book is that though neruda is a fantastic writer, the translations of his works as presented in this compilation are wordy and seem innacurate. The translator appears to have put too much of his own style or intuition into his translation. example: caliente is translated to ""incandesent"""
2,A Godawful Translation,"The one thing I will say in favor of the English translation here is that it forced me to read the Spanish. Belitt absolutely mangles the Spanish. Until I read the Spanish, I thought Neruda wasn't that good a poet - now I know better. As with far too many Neruda translations, you're better off buying a Spanish-English dictionary and doing it yourself."
3,A Poor Translation Of A Masterpiece,"I am bilingual, English and Spanish. I agree with the other reviews I read, the translation is too basic, sloppy and jut plain inaccurate. A good example: (Page 102) ""Lost Enigmas"": Neruda wrote: ""Me habeis preguntado que hila el crustaceo entre sus patas de oro...""It is translated by Ben Belitt: ""You would know what the crab weaves in the gold of its claws.""When translated correctly and to keep the poem's flavor, it would read: ""You have asked me what the crab is weaving between its golden claws.""I found other examples of errors such as these in the book.This book is only useful if you read only the original spanish poems; skip the inadequate translation."
1,Abominable translation,"This was my first exposure to Neruda's poetry and it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth. It seemed nonsensical and adolescent, like a teenager who thinks he's smarter than he actually is, writing poetry to impress his 9th grade English teacher. I was ready to conclude that Neruda was not worth wasting my time on until I got on here and discovered all the other one-star reviews berating the quality of the translation. For now I will reserve judgment on Neruda until I read a decent translation. This is a dreadful book."
2,Embarrasingly bad...,"...so much so, in fact, I can't believe these translations even made it past the editors at Grove. Bellitt lacks even the simplest feel for how Neruda words together, played ideas out to their conclusions, confronted the world, and changed again and again and again as a writer over those 5 decades from whence this book gets its title. Really a schlock job all round -- schoolboy translations, mediocre overall selection. I want my money back."
1,Pass on this one,"I have to agree with previous review. This was a very bad translation. Loses much of the imagery of the originals. I am bilingual, English being my first language. Save your money and choose another translator."
2,Hack job,"It's hard to believe the same guy who translated Lorca's ""Poeta en Nueva York"" so well could do such a spectacularly horrendous job with Neruda. It shames me to even share a language with this guy. He turns Neruda's beautiful concrete, surreal imagism into senseless abstractions, which are about as interesting to read in this context as an instruction booklet for a Vaccuum cleaner. This is a great collection, covering an immense spectrum of work, if you are familiar with the intricacies of the Spanish language, or are at least familiar with a lot of Pablo Neruda's writings, it definitely adds something as far as interpretation goes. If not I'd sincerely suggest looking at another translator. No one should experience Neruda this way!"
1,Awful.,"The poetry of Neruda in this book is amazing & worth buying the book for, however don't rely on Ben Belitt's translations because this guy is a moron. I cannot understand how he possibly got the translations that he did from this poetry. It's not even like others have said where he's trying to match the rhythm or trying to interpret what Neruda meant in Spanish, he full out adds in words and sentences that don't exist in the Spanish version and trying to read them in English is harder than reading them in Spanish because he obviously used google translate to publish this book making the English choppy. You're better off just buying this book all in Spanish and looking up translations online if needed. Whoever allowed Ben Belitt to translate anything & then continue to publish it should be fire, and Ben Belitt should never be allowed to go near another Neruda work for as long as he lives."
1,"Abysmal translation, Exquisite poetry","A terrible, terrible translation ... butchery of the most base sort. Ironically ... nay, fortunately, (Neruda will transcend Belitt by aeons) Neruda's timelessness roots deeply in his ability to provide effortless infusions of mood and imagery. Buy 500 Spanish Verbs, a Spanish dictionary, a Neruda without translation and a ticket to Valparaiso ... el insolito puerto sin puertas, puerto del ancho mar (PN). Find a seaside cafe and prepare to intertwine with Neruda's delicately winding timeless vines of earthly splendor."
2,Review of The Prophets: Their Times and Socdial Ideas by Shmuel Eisenstadt,"I read The Prophets:Their Times and Social Ideas as an assignment for a book club which is studying Jewish History and periodically looks at the confluence of Biblical and ancient history. The book club takes a secular, humanistic approach to Judaism and we thought the author's position would dovetail with our own. We, and I, were disappointed with the rigidity and simplicity of the author's writing and position and that it did not reflect scholarship. It was possibly appropriate for the times (mid-1920's) and country of origin (Soviet Union) but not for current thinkers."
2,Not like they used to be!,"I bought this sing-a-long not only because I love Disney sing-a-longs but because I'm planning a trip to Disney World and seeing as how the ""Disneyland Fun"" sing-a-long shows great footage of Disneyland, I thought this would do the same for Disney World. But it doesn't. It only shows footage of water parks. Also, it doesn't even have classic Disney songs. Instead is has songs like ""Pearly Shells."" Maybe for young kids it is good but it was extremely disappointing for me!"
3,Inconsistencies,"It just might be me but I see some inconsistencies. The show must have taken years to film because either the kids grew up or there are different kids towards the end. It does not look like Mika Boorem in the segment ""Hot, Hot, Hot"", In the segment ""Set Your Name Free""the lead-in looks different than the song itself as far as Caitlin Wachs, in the song she resembles Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen. Also in the same segment one minute Brenden Clark has sunglasses on his head, then no sunglasses, then sunglasses, then no sunglasses. There must have been some editing. Actually to me it looks like Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen is also in the next segment ""Surfin' Safari"". In the segment ""Set Your Name Free"" Brenden Clark looks taller than Mika Boorem, but in the lead-in segment to ""Three Littles Fishies"" where they are taking the pictures Mika looks taller than Brenden, but in the last segments Brenden looks taller than Mika again. I like the show despite these inconsistencies."
4,Excellent video for kids.,My 2 year old daughter loves to watch this video. It keeps her entertained the whole time. She loves the interaction between the kids and tries to mimick their dance moves...so cute! All of the songs are easily remembered and I catch myself singing right along too!
3,3rd part of trilogy and doesn't stand alone,"Wonderful prose, beautifully observed character study, as WG slips into the skin of an extremely priggish and snobbish early twenties aristocrat as he comes of age and begins to understand a little more of the virtues of the ordinary people around him. Sea journeys of that era were long, tedious, largely uneventful and extremely uncomfortable. All 3 books in the trilogy carry this perfectly: the maritime atmosphere is conveyed as perfectly as the arrogant character of the narrator. However, the tedium of the journey also comes across in the virtually non-existent plot which makes the books drag on somewhat. It is probably, though, as brilliant description of the English class system at the start of the 19th century as you will read. I believe that the books in Trilogies should be able to stand alone, if they are to be sold separately, & on that basis, this trilogy definitely fails. I'm glad I read it as a single 750 page tome."
2,On Ape and Essence,"Ape and Essence is a brief, bizarre, and ludicrously overwritten work of dystopian fiction. The book follows the discovery and full recital of a mysterious play; a play which was almost certainly written by Huxley while under the influence of a particularly foul hallucinogenic substance. Serious fans of Huxley and the dystopian sub-genre of science fiction may find the book worth pursuing, but I cannot honestly say that I would recommend it to any man, woman or child..."
2,a great dissapointment by a master of the anti-utopia,"we know huxley is a master in the literary world, and we know that he can write anti-utopian fiction, just read Brave New World. this is along the same lines, though without the niceties of BNW. and without the excellence of BNW. maybe it was the experimentation Huxley did with the form of the novel. but huxley still says a lot, perhaps more in this than he did in BNW. i'd recommend reading it just for the philosophy of huxley, but if you are expecting BNW, you are going to be dissapointed."
4,huh,"well, this was a very interesting book. I didn't really like the ending. Otherwise, it kept your interest throughout. Not bad"
2,Bizarre and Forgettable,"I am a tremendous fan of Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World."" Seeing that this book had high marks by other reviewers, I thought I might enjoy it. I have trouble believing that the same author wrote both books.""Ape and Essence"" begins in the movie industry where an old discarded script is discovered. The movie industry employees seek out the writer only to find he has been dead for a few weeks. After this revelation, the book jumps into the actual script. The script reads like a cheap romance novel. In a strange savage land, a man from civilization falls in love with a primative woman. They face conflict, but there forbidden love endures. They run away together and live happily. And we never find out what happens to the ever so fortunate movie mogels who rescued the script from incineration.Was Aldous Huxley suffering from writer's block when he wrote this? It is certainly not his best work. There is a reason few people have read this book. It is not very good."
5,This CD Changed My Life,I can't say enough about this CD and how it turned me on to Blossom. I had never even heard of her until a friend was playing this. Now I want to go to New York to catch her live. This CD seems like a great economical introduction to what is truly a beautiful world.
2,LADDER OFF BALANCE FROM USAGE,"WERNER USES A COUNTER BALANCE WER-55-1 FOR ALL ITS FOLDING ACCESS ATTIC LADDERS. BECAUSE THE COUNTER BALANCE IS TO ASSIST THE LADDER AS IT IS EXTENDED, THE MAKEUP OF THE MECHANISM (ALUMINUM) IS THE PROBLEM. THE MECHANISM BENDS AND ONCE THAT OCCURS REPLACING THE MECHANISM IS A PROBLEM. THE MECHANISM IS RIVETTED ONTO THE LADDERS FRAME AND THE RIVET(S) MUST BE DRILLED OUT. THIS MUST BE DONE OR YOU ARE FACED WITH REPLACING THE ENTIRE LADDER. GOOD LUCK."
3,Buy the Wider One Instead,"I just finished installing this 22 1/2"" wide ladder. The installation went fine for the most part. It had a handrail near the top which interefered with the spring mechanism during opening, but the handrail was useless so I removed it. But most of all, I really wish that I had bought the 25"" unit (Werner part number W2510). This one has only 17"" of space between the springs at the narrowest point near the top, not enough for my shoulders, let alone trying to carry something."
5,Love that MONKEY TRAP.,"Mimi Cross has edge and brains and a damn good grasp of the way it feels to be frustrated by all the trappings of relationships. ""Emotional Phobic"" is EXACTLY what I wanted to say to someone once...really, really loud. ""Ghost Inside"" is an invitation to slip deeper inside ourselves for a closer, darker look at the forces that move us. ""Easily"" makes me cry in my bowl of oatmeal and reminds me that I'm eating it ALONE. This is a fantastic Monkey Trap full of tunes. You can't help but keep reaching in there again and again."
5,Great Perspective,This book has great Christian perspective for those who are already married or who are soon to be married. It calls attention to the gift of sex that God has created for us and reminds us of the crucial role that it plays in the health of a marriage. The best part of this book is that it explains the different ways that men and women view sex and how it effects their emotional relationships with one another. I would definitely recommend this book to other Christian women who want to make their marriages the most they can be!
5,I would recommend to ANY woman,"I am engaged, and just finished reading this book. It has been so incredibly helpful. I would recommend it to any woman (whether married or not) because I think it accurately displays the aspect of sex like the Bible intends for it to be. I have never had sex before, yet learned so much from this book because it discussed sex as it's meant to be- in such a healthy, beautiful way. It is also a great book for anyone who has been abused or has not lived in an environment in which sex was a healthy thing."
4,Havent read yet but cant wait to,"It is so important that we realize this book is for married people, not older teens. This book applies christian principles to sexual intimacy between husband and wife not for those who fornicate. I encourage all to keep this book sacred and not use it as a tool to engage in sinful sexual practices"
5,What an eye opener!,"Well written and biblically based; teaching us how to enjoy our sex lives... Christian or not, we should all have access to these types of insightful perspectives before we get married. Thank you - Lorraine and Linda - for taking time to explore the issue, using such refreshing and concise information that we can all relate to and apply to our lives."
4,A wonderful resource with valuable insights.,"This book is a great book for married couples with children. It is difficult to think about having sex with your husband, when you have 3 toddlers at your knees. It is a practical guide to keep your marriage sizzling, from a Christian perspective."
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"I bought this book after several women in my bible study mentioned it; we were doing Every Woman's Marriage at the time. They couldn't say enough great things about this book. Eh, I wasn't impressed. The author seems to be very repetitive. I have limited time to read with a toddler and reading the same things over and over is frustrating! I didn't get any great ideas from the book. Will probably sell mine used on Amazon in the near future!"
4,Great biblical views on marriage,I thought this was a great book! A necessary read for all married women. Dillow answers many questions that Christian women have regarding sex and a godly marriage.
5,Learn to love your husband in a new way!,"This book showed me what sexual intimacy is supposed to look like and what an incredible gift it can be. No matter how painful our circumstances, no woman is beyond the healing touch of God. Whether you're a newlywed or someone like me and well-passed your silver anniversary, it will just plain teach you how to be a good lover. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go buy ALOT of ribbon!"
4,For Any Woman Who Is Going To or Has Had Sex,"I enjoy this book. I have read through it once and occasionally will go back and re-read chapters at times when they apply. I bought this book for my sister who is planning on getting married. I think that as Christians too often we are too afraid or embarassed to discuss sex and our views of it often become skewed because we allow main stream society to do the shaping of ourselves and our sex lives. God created sex to be beautiful between a man and a woman, an intamacy like no other. This book addresses all of these issues and more. This book is for anyone who wants to improve on their sexual selfworth or their sex life."
4,Great book,I was a little hesitant when I bought this book but did so because I the reviews. This book is great. It gets the the heart of so many marriage matters in a very meaningful and usable way. I am going to ask my husband to read it so we can talk about some of the subjects.
1,Boring.,"Don't waste your time. Go with Celebration of Sex instead. It's got all the same stuff, plus some practical sexual advice for married women."
3,Always came late,"I have had a sudscription to B&G off and on my whole life. Most recent, I had a subscription over the past 2 years. I love the content of the newspaper, but it never came on time. during the season I would get my issue a week late. The 1st half of the issue is previewing that weeks game, making half the issue useless to me."
1,So You Wanna Be a Stuntman: The Official Stuntman's Guideboo,"Although this book sounded very promising, I did not receive the benefits that it promised. It seemed that the writer may have been rushed to get this book published. This is unfortunate. I would not ask for my money to be returned, however I also would not recommend the book to anyone. I don't think this ""book"" has the right to be called ""The Official Stuntman's Guidebook"". Sorry, but you'd be better off looking elsewhere for advice."
5,A real look at spiritual warfare!,"This very powerful work, gives the reader a profound picture of spiritual warfare at it's best. While the term ""Spiritual warfare"" is new to many, the battles that are depicted in this writing are not. Mr. Hudson presents a very poignant portrayal of how serious the demons are about their assignmnents and of how our daily decisions work to fuel the flames of war.This is a must read for anyone committed to battling Satan.I recently met the author and was even more blessed when I learned this book was truly inspired by the Holy Spirit. To be obedient enough to allow God to use you in this manner is a testimony of Mr. Hudsons's belief."
4,space opera with a little extra,"Needing something light to read, I reached for this novel that I had good memories of. Initially I found it disappointing - a typical space opera with the obligatory violence, ugly aliens, beautiful women, and even a bit of implied sex. But I did find what appealed to me. This novel heads off into the extraordinary and even has a thoughtful message about the unseen harm we might be doing - even if it is inadvertent. There is also one startling moment of crisis and realisation in a dramatic moment for the lead character - even though it isn't key to the story, it is breath taking.other recommendations:'Counter Clock World' by Philip K Dick'Ramunujam' by Robert Kanigal"
3,Antique and Vintage Clothing,I was dissapointed in this book. The historical photos and clothing are great to see but unfortunately many are out of focus and over or under exposed. The author does not reference her sources for the clothing and as a result I find it hard to trust her dating methods. I would not recommend this as a professional reference book for the historical costumer.
5,Excellent photos. A must for any Victorian lover,"I love to recreate Victorian clothing. I have never come across a book with such clear photographs of clothing, undergarments, and hats. I also try to intergrate Victorian fashion into todays fashions and this book is an excellent guide."
1,dangerous book,"I would rate this a very dangerous book, as it contains a lot of incorrect information and also suggests - through pictures and the like - that antique clothing can be worn by modern people. The photographs some admittedly beautiful garments are amateurish, a number of garments and accessories - in particular bonnets - are incorrectly dated etc.Total waste of money and not a good starting point for the serious collector.Kay"
3,BETTER COTTON ELSEWHERE!,"I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD. WHILE I KNEW THAT JAMES COTTON HAS ADVANCED IN YEARS, I THOUGHT THAT THE ADDITION OF JAZZ BASSIST, CHARLIE HADEN AND BLUES GUITAR SLINGER JOE LOUIS WALKER COMBINED WITH COTTON'S HARP WOULD MAKE THIS A STANDOUT CD. IT DIDN'T. JOE LOUIS WALKER PLAYS A TONED DOWN ACOUSTIC GUITAR AND CHARLIE HADEN IS BARELY NOTICABLE. WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS JAMES COTTON BLOWIN A RATHER WEAK HARMONICA AND SINGING WITH AN AGED AND GRAVELY VOICE. IF YOU ARE INCLINED TO PURCHASE THIS DON'T DO IT IN RELIANCE ON THE SUPPORTING CAST. DO IT BECAUSE YOU LIKE JAMES COTTON. WHILE IT IS NOT BAD, I'D RECOMMEND PICKING OTHER EARLIER COTTON!"
3,Short CD,I bought this expecting it to be the full version. I guess I should have read the details more closely. Know that it only has two songs.
5,greatest cd ever,this is my second favorite cd in the entire world [besides ok go's first cd]. buy it right now. every single song is spectacular.
2,"Somewhat nice table, but Funantics is a terrible company to order from","I placed order on 12/1, didn't receive table until 12/22. Was nervous that wouldn't rec'v in time for Christmas. Called and emailed company, no response. Table arrived, covering on table was torn, called and emailed company again, took them 9 days to respond by email. Said I needed to respond within 48 hours for a replacement. The table itself is somewhat ok. A little dingy, ok for a kid to play with."
3,Weak entry in a strong series,"This book like the Wonder Worker continues in the vein of the Church of England series, which is one my favorites. While the plot was fairly strong, the writing was not up to Ms. Howatch's usually excellent standards. The bare bones stuck out too much--I felt like I was reading an earlier draft that had not yet had the rough edges polished off. The dialogue, especially Carter's interior dialogue was clunky, repetitive and unconvincing. Many of the events seemed labored and over the top. Did her husband Kim really have to be a Nazi and involved in the occult, and in perverse sex? Themes were pushed hard instead being more quietly illustrated by the story itself. Howatch still writes a gripping spiritual thriller, but this needed more work."
4,Another mesmerizing novel by Howatch,"This was really one of her best books. The transformation that Carter/Catriona undergoes was fascinating to read and the deception perpetuated by Kim was equally amazing. Howatch always makes me think about my faith and she does it in a subtle, effective manner. This was difficult to put down and a book that I was sorry to finish."
1,Obsessive and never ending,"At about page two hundred, when the first part of the novel has a resolution, i was wondering how the author was going to fill the next 300 pages. well, she does it by using thousands and thousands of words having obsessive conversations with a number of people about what happened during the first two hundred pages. The first part of the book was very good. She should have wrapped it up shortly after that. instead, it just became ridiculous. [SEMI SPOILER FOLLOWS] maybe someone just should have told our high flyer that some of the other characters in the book are a bunch of lunatics. perhaps then she could have moved on. also, the author really needs to limit her use of words like ""nutterguff"" and ""fluffette."" this became very annoying."
1,High Flyer - grounded,"This book started out as an interesting story about strong people and social situations. It tuned into a poor exchange between ""good and evil"". For me it was a huge disappointment."
1,Greatly Disappointed,Is this the same author who wrote the Starbridge series? I found this book to be contrived and overwritten--the story could have been told in half the space. There is a wearisome repetition of coined words; the dialogue is tedious as the main character examines her soul/values/morals at length with everyone who crosses her path. Enough!
1,it held my interest,It held my interest is the only positive statement I can make about The High Flyer. On the whole I was quite disappointed. I had loved several of Susan Howatch's books including Penmarric and Cashelmara so I was looking forward to this one. I found the main character to be shallow and short tempered. The dialogue was simple and frustrating at the same time. I will not be recommending this book to friends or family. Thank you for this opportunity to review this book.
4,faith and mystery - perfect blend,"Nashville City Paper BookClub Column - May 27, 2004I also really liked The High Flyer by Susan Howatch (Ballantine Books). Londoner Carter Graham's life comes crashing down around her and Howatch continues her tradition of resolving her characters' problems with a dose of religion.Nashville City Paper BookClub Column - May 27, 2004"
3,"Not as good as the first, but worth owning","I remember reading the first book (""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"") when I was in school and I loved it. I had no idea there was a sequal to it until it showed up on my recommendations list. I purchased it for my daughter. It is a good story, but for me at least, it was just a sequal to a much better story. I am glad I purchased both books, but my daughter and I really enjoy the first much more."
1,Disappointing sequel,"Years ago, my kids had enjoyed the book ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"". When I learned that there was a sequel, I immediately ordered it for my two young grandsons, along with the original. Both my husband and I were disappointed with the new book; it seemed downright silly and except for ""grandpa"" in the story, it didn't have too much to do with the original."
3,Eh...,"I grew up loving the prequel Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, so I bought this book a while back to complete the collection. Upon reading it however, I was quite dissapointed...it is okay as a children's book, but as a sequel it wasn't up to par with the original. I felt that this book lacked the charm that the original had, though the message about sharing is nice I guess. All in all if you're going to buy the book based on the original, expect to be dissapointed...but if you're buying it for a kid's collection it's alright."
3,"Good book, though this sequel is not as good as original","This book, Pickles to Pittsburgh, is the sequel to one of my favorite books as a child, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. The sequel did not meet up to my expectations and there did not seem to be as much imagination to the story as the first one. It seemed as though the author just decided to write a book with a bunch of pages full of giant food with a lackluster plotline. I do recommend this for children(around 8 years old) who already have the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs book."
3,Imaginative,This book is most interesting for 4-8 year olds but it will continue to be read forever. It is about a girl's dream. She dreams about a different world. Everything is made out of food. Kids ennjoy the imagination in this wonderful book.
3,"Nice illustrations, weak story","We (kids and parents) loved Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, but no one was really impressed with the story. We spend more time just checking out the neat illustrations than reading the text."
2,Pickles is the pits,This is a terrible book. It doesn't even compare to the first. My husband and I both hate reading it.
3,Stick with the first book,"I love Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs so I had to get this book. However, I really didn't enjoy it as much. The illustrations are just as nice so it's still a fun book to look at but the story isn't that great. It's about a dream that the kids have while Grandpa is away where they visit Chewandswallow. Most of the story is just describing what they see and then all of the sudden toward the end they find out that the old townspeople have created a company that sends the food all around the world to help those in need. The message is nice but the story just wasn't as fun to read or interesting. A lot of it felt like a repeat of the first book just not as good. I think I could have done without this one."
5,great reading,My grandosn loves this sequel. His parents read it to him as soon as he received it. He loves Cloudy with a Chance of meatballs and looks forward to seeing the movie. Great author.
1,Big disappointment,"Pickles To PittsburghThis book is definitely not as good as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. I was rather disappointed in it, actually. It's pretty pointless compared to the first and sadly unimaginative. I had such high hopes for this book, and was really excited when I found it. I feel like I wasted my money. :("
1,Item pictured is not what you get,"The item in the picture is a black denim FatBoy, that looks very similar to the current (real) black denim Fatboy lo. What you actually get is what you see in the second photo. If you want a particular color or style forget it. They send you whatever color/style they happen to pull off the shelf. Wanted this because the one in the picture looks just like my bike."
3,Small toy,"I guess I should have read the description better, for the price of a toy motorcycle that Bradley does anything, it wasn't worth it"
1,Never again will I order here,"Be better on details, thought this was a toy my son could ride, not some small little crappy toy, that only he can use with his hands. Pretty pissed, I wouldn't spend 30bucks on a little toy like this. Never again!"
5,Great Table - Perfect Size,I bought this table for my 18-month-old. I wanted something small for her playroom where she could sit and color. This table is fantastic. It is easy for her to access and she uses it constantly. Many of the tables I looked at while shopping were paired with chairs that were just too tall for her. This table/bench combo is the perfect size. It is also light weight and easy to move from room to room. I would recommend it highly.
5,Best Table!,"We purchased this table when our daughter was 18 months old. It is the best table out there, it is very sturdy and she learned to get in and out of it very easily which was a plus over tables with separate chairs. Our daughter is now 2+ yrs old and we still use it every day. We use it to draw and paint, take it outside to our garden and bring it back in, nothing seems to damage it, my husband and I even sit on it sideways. I love the fact that it folds nicely for storage. This table has been a hit with our daughter's little friends too, when they come over several kids will sit together and eat and I've even taken it to the park for picnics. BEST BUY!!! We expect to be using it for at least another 2 years or more. Even our 5 year old nephews want to eat breakfast in it whenever they stay over!!"
2,Not bad,its a great price but its VERY small. Its unfortunate because it seems well made and folds up nicely but its way too small. There's no way 4 kids can comfortable sit at it.
3,a little boring,I guess it was to be expected though. It is just a bunch of transcripts of speechs given about copyright from both sides.
3,Cato Institute Book Covers Some Issues,"I read this book for a law course on current copyright law issues. The book is based off of a conference sponsored by the Cato Institute, so it has a libertarian slant. The first section on copyright theory is helpful if you aren't familiar with it, but I found that the arguments were basically the same ones I read in my copyright casebook. A large chunk of the book talks about the DMCA and in particular its anti-circumvention provision, with most of the writers complaining against it. The points they make can get repetitive, and I found myself skimming them after a while. I was disappointed that the writers weren't more creative about their topics; there are certainly other issues going on out there. There are a few chapters towards the end that talk about patents, and since I know nothing about patents and didn't get the book to learn about them I didn't bother with those chapters at all."
3,the good bad and ugly,Good product poorly packaged for shipment. Arrived with box torn and damage on the corner of the door. I will live with it due to time constraints of construction sequencing but irritates me every time it catches my eye. Could easily have been packaged properly with a stouter box with reinforcement at corners.
1,Shipping debacle cause for low score,"The shipping process was a nightmare. The product came via UPS via Bahgdad I am convinced, based on the condition of the box. I refused delivery and had Amazon try again. The second attempt met with similar results only this time the box was even more demolished and I wasn't home when it arrived [what a surprise]. Since the box was in no condition for return I took the ladder out of the box and checked its condition. Despite the outward appearance of the box the only problems seemed to be dented and chipped wood on the frame. It seemed to be still in square. I hope it will function when I get it installed. Two points: The box needs to be more robust to withstand shipment and the carrier needs to take a little, no, make that a lot better care in handling."
4,Werner attic ladder,"I rated it a 4 because of 'they' cheaped out on the 5/8"" wood frame that attaches to the framed-out 2x6's in the ceiling. I believe the wood was fur but I think that for the price of the item and the quality of the rest of the ladder, they should have spent another 5 dollars. Apparently the designers never have first hand experience with the end results of their designs. The aluminum provides good rigidity after repeated use. I installed it myself. I'm 59 and 155# and did not have a problem."
2,Let down......,"As a builder who has purchased many wooden ladders over the years, I thought that I would be providing a superior product to my customers with the purchase of a Werner aluminum ladder.While the ladder itself is sturdy, I was disappointed to find many missing bolts (had to run up to Home depot for bolts to ""re-assemble"" the ladder) One ""L"" bracket was just loose in the box, and other bolts were not tightened.Additionally, the 1/4"" panel sent with the door is a horrible piece of wood. The painter will have to spend a lot of time sanding, putty-ing, and prepping; or we will have to re-skin with another piece of panel. I do not expect stain grade material on an attic access, but I would have difficulty finding a comparatively junky piece of material at the lumber yard.I won't purchase this ladder again."
2,Several Severe Inaccuracies,"There are sections of this book that are just about as wrong as wrong gets. For instance, the section on concatenated indexes (page 214) was true in version 7 but is greatly different in version 8.This book is a pretty good start, but readers should be aware that the author did not do a good job including new features of version 8. For this reason, I strongly disagree with the other reviews. If this book is your only reference for Oracle 8 tuning, chances are you'll not take advantage of new, rich features."
4,"An orphan boy challenges others to ""play square""","Mickey is an orphaned newspaper boy who finds a little crippled girl and befriends her. He has such a strong desire to be the boy his mother taught him how to be, that he wins the hearts of everyone he touches. Will he find ""Peaches"" a family? And what of his young lawyer friend? How does a fatherless boy of the inner city discover happiness in teaching others to ""be square"" is a tale you'll love to read to your children."
4,Pleasant Read,"I'm 28 and love ""feel good"" books. This wasn't my favorite of Gene Stratton-Porter's books but it was upbeat and has really sweet moments. There just seemed to be a few repetetive and pointless conversations. Sometimes too, I didn't know exactly where it was going - even though though that's not all bad. All and all, when I was through reading it I felt satisfied.Try ""The Magic Garden"". I loved it!"
5,A truly bad trip,"This is a truly unique piece of music. It combines acoustic and electronic sounds seamlessly taking influences from noise bands, Penderecki, and rock music. The title is a completely accurate depiction of what you will hear. If you like insane, distorted music that makes you feel a bit uncomfortable, check this out."
3,Okay,"I saw GodSend in the Theatres and it was okay. I definitly suggest that you rent this one first, and then if you like it, buy it. But, I liked it okay so buying it is a maybe. If they had done more on the whole subject of cloning, then it could be a four star. I love Cameron Bright, he is an absolutly wonderful little actor!"
2,"Good Actors, Lousy Script","I won't bother with the storyline of this flick; the previews tell it all. The problem with Godsend is its lousy timing. You cannot hold your audience in endless suspense and not deliver. It simply doesn't work.There are too many unanswered questions in this movie. Who is Robert DeNiro's character? Was he the father of the deceased Zachary? Is Adam simply a delusional paranoid schizophrenic child? Are his ""visions"" supernatural occurrences? Who knows? You sure can't tell from watching the movie.I'm reminded of Stephen King's Pet Symatery theme of ""what's dead should stay dead."" This movie should have died on the cutting room floor at the latest stage of the game. If you're looking for examples of how NOT to handle suspense, rent this turkey."
1,wow this movie sucked!,"Okay, so i had heard bad things about this movie so I wasn't expecting much. This movie was sooo bad. One of the worst I have ever seen, and that's saying alot. The 'alternate endings' were better than the one that was used in the final cut. The acting is terrible and the camera shots got on my nerves. I couldn't understand what exactly was happening to the little kid that was so scary. I'm not usually this critical on films, but this one was just a complete waste of time."
2,""" Its your standard piece of escapism and not much more then that.""",Godsend's premise is somewhat interesting but its execution is far to predictable and mundane ultimately its your standard piece of escapism and not much more then that. The only real noteworthy scene in the film is when Robert De Niro goes crazy in the church at the end of the film granted its not terrible but its not good either I would say its a tolerable film but its not really worth investing time into it.
1,A pathertic little abortion....,"That should never have been made. You should know that when a movie had 5 different endings, there was something wrong with the script. Greg Kinnear and Robert Di Niro are excellent actors, but this script stunk.Everyone in this film is miscast and don't fit their parts. The story seemed to have been written as they filmed rather than following a script.Avoid!"
3,Disappointment,The trailer was the best part of the film. Even Mr. Robert Dinero couldn't keep the hype alive like the film industry tried so hard to do knowing it would be a blockbuster flop.
2,2 stars for acting and the movie's idea,"The acting of Kinnear and DeNiro was wasted on this poorly executed film. There was a lack of vision to the movie that I found frustrating. I found myself wondering how the actors felt having given very solid performances, only to see the finished product in preview? The story just dropped and left you feeling like you'd wasted two hours. The child's part was poorly developed, as were the clues or storyline leading up to the end. Perhaps that's why they couldn't find a fitting ending. The movie lacked good flow. The father and mother's roles should have somehow been opposite, until the end. It just didn't work.Where was the plot? Where was the screenwriter? Where was the editor? Someone needed to guide this film. No one did. As a result, it fell flat."
1,Waste of time and money,"What WAS this mess? After over an hour of sitting through this I had to get up and leave. It was horribly boring. Nothing but a series of long drawn-out scenes that don't go anywhere. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing did. If you are curious about this movie, wait for it to come out for rent. It probably will be out VERY soon."
1,Be afraid; be very afraid ...,"of waisting 101 minutes of your life watching this movie! Is it a horror film? No way. Scientific thriller? No way. It is a VERY boring attempt at both of the above genres. Despite a couple of scenes that remind you of The Omen or Audrey Rose - this is dullsville, baby. The script and dialogue are truly bad - and I think they know it. Even at a high volume, I needed to turn on the subtitles to catch all of the dialogue: my mistake! Save yourselves the time and money; do not even rent this turkey. A few times I switched over to hear the Director's commentary (you know - to drown out the dialogue that I could hear) and boy was he excited about it all! Poor, deluded guy."
2,Check out London Voodoo instead,"I bet, like me, you thought a creepy film with DeNiro was bound to be a winner? Wrong. This film is a dreadful dreary load of tosh.Save your money and buy London Voodoo instead: known only by the well-informed, this UK gem of psychological thriller will blow you away.Forgot Godsend - it's hollywood dross. Check out London Voodo - best film I've seen this year by far.Tone"
1,"good concept, lame movie","They could have done a lot better with this whole cloning idea. There were so many other directions the story could have gone which would have made it a great movie, in my opinion. The acting was weak on all sides, no big stars could have saved this plot. It wasn't scary, was not even 'creepy' and lacked suspense. To say it was boring and moved slow doesn't even cover it. It's not even qualified for ""So bad it's good"" status, it's just plain BAD! Not worthy of a ""worst ever"" list either. It was not bad in an earth shaking way, it's more of an average, run of the mill, forgetable 'whatever' kind of movie."
1,Send It Away!,"This movie is anything but a Godsend for fans of horror films. I am one of the few people who had the misfortune of seeing this movie in the theater. Yes, I paid ten bucks to have my intelligence insulted. Yes, I sat through 90 minutes of the worst over-acting that Robert DeNiro has ever done, and that's saying something. We all know that Bobby D. isn't exactly subtle. When you add in two colossally untalented thespians like Rebecca Romijn and Greg Kinnear, you get Godsend. This is a rancid movie, a thing that's best handled with latex gloves as you heave it into the dumpster. Slick art and an interesting title are a smokescreen, do not be fooled."
3,Disturbing!,"This movie started out pretty good; you know a tragedy happens and someone comes along to make things 'better.'After our couple loses their 8 year old son to a terrible accident, they are asked by a genetic doctor played by Robert Deniro if they wanted to see their son reborn. I won't go into the specifics of this, but it is the premise of the storyline.As their 'new son' reaches his 8th birthday everything changes, even the boy himself. He starts to become evil and you find out that their son shares his body with another. Creepy.I didn't like this movie. The acting wasn't that good and the ending was typical although disturbing."
5,Godsend,"A loving couple Jessie (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and Paul Duncan (Greg Kinnear) loses their 8 year old son Adam to a terrible car accident. While planning the boy's burial, a doctor by the name of Richard Wells (Robert De Niro) tells them that he is able to clone the boy. Hesitant, the two accept.When the baby is born, he looks and acts like Adam, but when he reaches his 8th birthday party (the day the first Adam dies), he starts to act weird. Is the boy really Adam or did Richard Wells combine the wrong genes??Watch `Godsend' and find out!!!"
3,"Better than average, but has some flaws","I don't want to give too much away about this film, especially since it has some sci-fi/supernatural elements that could be ruined by giving away too much. The basic plot: A couple (Greg Kinnear, Rebecca Romin-Stamos) have a son who has suffered a trauma and literally returned from death. In time, he has recurring nightmares which are so bad he actually goes comatose. De Niro plays the boy's doctor.The movie has a satisfying creepiness to it but has some serious plot flaws and, at times, a very slow pace. I found De Niro's performance to be less than stellar. Still, it is a watchable film and, for fans of horror/suspense, is certainly better than average. Not great, not terrible, but worth seeing if you are fans of the actors and enjoy suspense/horror. You might prefer to wait till it is in video stores, however."
1,Godsend? How about Godawful!,"I'm in total agreement with most of the reviews on this film. It is completely devoid of suspense or any type of chill factor. All the actors try their best with what they have, but it just does not work in any way shape or form. A total DUD!"
1,Very poor. Boo Nick Hamm,"Good actors, good acting - but I will NEVER rent a Nick Hamm movie again. The first half seems reasonable & is quite good then the second half all of a sudden takes on a unrealistic, overboard twist like a cheesy horror movie. It's like they don't know what kind of movie they're doing. By renting the DVD I see the many alternate endings, which are all poor. For gosh sakes Hamm, get a good ending & decided on one before you put good actors through a bad script the next time. I don't know of anyone who rented this & didn't feel ripped off on this one. Just look at how many are up for sale...cheap."
2,Not Too Good,"I would have expected more from DeNiro, one of the greatest actors in history. The film disappointed me. It's fantasy of memory transfer in genes is just too far from the truth to buy. Sure, it is a movie, but how far must we separate ourselves from reality to enjoy a film?Could have been a better film..a much better film with a better ending. Not enough reasons were given for the boy's ""evil"" behavior. Not enough explanation.Don't waste your time on this one."
3,One of the more intellegent suspense films now adays.,"Certainly not a great movie, but it has a smart plot that provides a few scares. The Sixth Sense and The village are much better. With a surprising ending, although somewhat predictable, it possesses a certain originality that many scary movies these days lack, like Taking Lives which was way too predictable and entirely unoriginal. The performances are nothing special, but are good enough i guess. People looking for smart, original, scary movies should look at Sphere and anything from M. Night Shyamalan. 6 out of a 10."
1,The most boring film prolly ever,"My sister and her fiance went see this at the movies and they said 20 mins after it started they fell asleep in the theater and they said it was so boring, that it was awful, so if u wanna see a first place boredome movie get this if u cant sleep."
3,wow oh wow...,wow this movie had my friend and i flipping out through out the entire movie the boy had a evil sense about him in the movie and i think that he was the perfect kid for that roll. the whole gray eyes and the deep stares just completly freaked us out. i think that it was a very good movie and i would see it again and again...
3,WEIRD,IDE GIVE IT A 3 IN A HALF. THIS MOVIE WAS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING. TO MANY TWISTS. IT MAKES IT CONFUSING. THOUGH IT DOES GET CREEPY AT PARTS. BUT WHOEVER THOUGHT OF CASTING ROBERT DENIRO AS A CRAZED DOCTOR AND THINKING HE COULD PULL IT OFF......WEL THEY WERE SADLY MISTAKEN
5,Loved it!,"There wasn't too much hype over this movie, I was truly look forward to seeing it and after I did I thought it was truly amazing and orriginal, Greg Kinnear did a surperb performance. Very orriginal idea, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat with kean interest. Very orriginal, in my book it surpasses the hype and performance of The Ring, deffinately a must see and must buy, 5 stars."
3,disappointing,"This movie was set up in trailers to look like a supernatural thriller with an all star cast, plot, and spook factor. However, the only thing all star about this movie is the cast. The plot is interesting at first, but cruddy screenplay writing makes the twists and turns of the plot become more and more obvious throughout the movie. And spook factor? Nope, not here. While there are a good few ""jump"" moments that catch you by surprise, and a scene when the boy's in the bathtub that's pretty creepy, the movie offers up little more than repetitive ""visions"" that Adam(the little boy)suffers from. While the story IS interesting, this movie supplies almost nothing it said it would in the trailers, and for that it doesn't even deserve the 3 stars I gave it. However, the acting of the cast in this movie was top notch, and that saved the movie from complete and utter humiliation. Don't pick this one up, it's not worth the 102 minutes of your life that it'll take up if you watch it."
2,Watch Something Else!,"Talk about a waste of time! Very predictable and it doesn't even try to be convincing. The 2 stars are for the entertainment value, which I honestly can get from watching any half-assed reality show on TV.And just when you think that Robert De Nior's career couldn't plummet any further, he disappoints you Again! It's a shame! The little boy was actually pretty good and so was Greg Kinnear.I think if you really really get into this film, you will find it to be ""OK"" at the end. If you watch it like you watch any other movie, you will be like me, ""I can't believe I missed that special on the Discovery Channel over this!"" at the end."
3,well,the movie was filled with jumps and scares but the story wasnt as good as it could have been.... the good thing is is that im really good at predicting and figuring out the plot is movies.... but this one i didnt.... probably because i was waiting for the next scary moment lol
1,Godsend.,Me and two of my friends went to see this movie. We were very excited because the commericals made it seem so exciting. If you are reading this please take my advice and don't ever ever see this movie. It's horrible. It has no action. No romance. A little mystery and barely a plot. It only gets midly interesting at the end for like 2 minutes. The movie is not worth the money. In the end of the movie people in the movie theather were literally hoping that it would end and cheering when it did.If you're anything like me(age 17 male dont do it.) Take my advice and don't forsake yourself. If you want to see a good action movie go and see The Punisher.
1,Godsend is GodAwful,"Greg Kinnear (Auto Focus, Dear God) and Rebecca Romjin Stamos (The Punisher, X-Men 1 and 2) are a couple who's kid dies by a tradgic accident and soon after a doctor friend of the family, Robert De Niro (Heat 15 Minutes), tells them about this procedure that they can inject into Stamos so she can give birth to the same and indentical son who was killed, though there are always flaws and the one flaw is that when he gets to the age he died at things will start to happen. A mind boggling boring thriller with Kinnear and De Niro giving off no juice to their parts. This could of been a hell of a lot better. This is based off of Dean Koontz book of the same name. Stamos is dried out just like she was in The Punisher. This may freak out people who have night terrors but to me its a waste of my time. If you stay threw the whole thing then you will be ok."
1,A carefully crafted flop,"The fact that this is a big name, big budget film shows throughout - to bad it is all wasted.Obviously this is a horror film and not a scientific documentary, but STILL - the things they attribute to the cloning are just ridiculous, a better way to develop the plot could have easily been found.What is even worse (well, that is debateable) is that the characters' motivations for actions both big and small are generally poorly conceived, it all simply does not work. The big revelation in the church while surprising is also absurd to the point that the film is simply ruined...Watch it if you must, but.. why would anyone want to have the DVD to watch again and again?"
4,Very Scary...,"This was a pretty cool movie starring Rebecca Romaine-Stamos from X-Men and Craig Kilborn. It is not as good as my favorite movie, Jeepers Creepers 2, but is still pretty good. If you like evil kid movies, like The Good Son, then you'll like this. The best part is that the DVD has 4 different endings. Both times I saw it in the theater it had one ending and it was the same each time."
1,"Note to Self, Never Go See Lions Gate Films Ever Again","Why is it that I always get suckered into seeing a Lions Gate film? It seems like Lions Gate only releases movies that are so bad that no one else would. There may be a few exceptions, but Lions Gate movies suck and I have done my research.Same goes for this gumble of a movie. I can't believe that De Niro even got involved with this. Granted he's done some really bad movies, especially Analyze That (but its still clear why he'd want to do it). This movie is corny when it's supposed to be emotional and its boring when its supposed to be creepy. There is no resolution and it really should have since there the only thing that could have saved this movie would have been an interesting resolution.The idea of the movie is interesting, but appantently they got a C average seventh grader to write it and a group of monkeys to make it instead of competent film makers. You might want to see it because of it's good cast, but trust me that is just gild."
1,THUMP!!!,"What was that sound? That was the sound of a movie with great potential falling flat on its face. This movie looked great in the ad, but that's what they're meant to do... fool you! This movie could have been so great, but the script and direction ruined it. I was also excited since the king of kings was in it... Robert DeNiro. If you are smart, you'll take my advice and steer clear of this flick, make your mind do a 180 degree turn and avoid this movie at all costs. L8r"
1,What the...?,"I have never been one to write such a bad review of a movie, but I feel compelled to warn others away from this one. It was just plain terrible. I figured with the big name actors involved, it would have to be halfway decent at the least. Boy, was I wrong. If someone suggests going to see it, JUST SAY NO."
3,This book was mediocre,I read other reviews before purchasing this book but I did not let it influence my desicion to buy.It was a bit hard to get into the book's structure. I think the premise of the book was a great idea but it seems many are not into this whole Socratic way of thinking.I was fortunate to get through the book. I wouldn't suggest someone buy this book. Perhaps used...ok. But to spend full price maybe not a good buy.Turco makes wisecracks at certain points that seem dull and lame. The dialogue is a bit forced which he is trying to teach avoiding such dialogue.Every writer deserves to boast about their abilities however Turco went slightly overboard on this one.Better luck next time?
1,Borrow from the library,"Rather than rehash what other reviewers have said, let me save you some trouble. If you absolutely feel compelled to read this book, check it out from the library - then skip to the last chapter. Everything Lewis Turco has worth saying is summed up there. My copy is 111 pages long - I highlighted 7 statements in the entire book, 4 of which only reinforced what I already knew. I wish I could get back the hours I forced myself to finish this piece of garbage.For the life of me, I can't understand why publishers keep printing this book. I've read better articles about dialogue by amateur writers online. Why'd they pick this guy to write this book? Most of what he has published is non-fiction or poetry. Many of the few fiction books he's published were co-authored."
1,Dialogue,I was very disappointed in the book. The book was very hard to read because the dialogue was very boring. (He wrote the book as if he was having a conversation with himself.) This style made it useless as a reference manual.I would recommend the following books instead: Writing Dialogue by Tom Chiarella and Film Scriptwriting: A Practical Manual by Swain & Swain.
2,Technically correct but somewhat lacking in substance.,"Slim volume. Too much info about obvious techniques: how to use quotations, quotations within quotations, how to properly format a script, etc. NOT enough explanation about the ways in which dialogue can establish desire, opposition, conflict, setting, and character. Overall, the book is well written (grammatically correct), well thought out (clearly defined concepts) but LACKING in any USEFUL substance (ie, ways the writer can USE the dialogue to MOVE the narrative forward). This book is OK for a high-school level introduction to the elements of dialogue."
2,Goldwell Hair Spray Super firm with Shine,Not very firm at all. Like the fact that it's not an aerosole. Fragrance too noticeable for my preference.
5,Perfect,"A friend recommended this book and I loved it. From her quick recipe for soup to making shepherd's pie for 150, Colwin's writing is beautiful and familiar. She's got a sense of humor and excellent taste buds. I can't wait to read everything else she wrote."
4,Dated but Sweet,"Laurie Colwin was always my favorite part of Gourmet magazine. Since her passing, I have kinda put her at the back of my brain. recently I ordered her old essays and really enjoyed the writing. The material is dated. It was the late 80's. Still, her candor and style are impressive. If you're a foodie, read her. You'll love her as I do."
3,"good writing, so-so recipes","I enjoyed reading the 2nd ""Writer in the kitchen"" book and thought I'd backtrack and read the 1st. I enjoy this woman's writing style very much. Light, witty, very engaging. It's sad this woman died so early. As for the recipes, for the most part they are pretty ordinary if not downright boring by today's standards. I realize these books were written many years before the avalanche of cooking magazines and chef's cooking shows and cutting edge restaurants. So, at the time the books were written, the simplicity of ingredients and casual cooking style was probably very refreshing. If you don't cook much, both these books might give you confidence to start. The cranberry pie thingie was great."
3,Library copy,"I believe this copy was described as excellent. It wasn't; it was a rather beat up library copy, but the price was good."
5,Outstanding,"This book is so much fun to read. It feels like you're in her kitchen, having a good chat with an old friend. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys food, cooking and/or entertaining."
5,Essential reading when moving to .NET,"This book is the first you should read if you are moving to the .NET framework. It covers everything at a high level, zooming in on specifics just frequently enough to provide a solid basic understanding. Chappell writes and organizes well. 6 stars."
3,Microsoft marketing materials...,"Although Chappell did an excellent job of presenting technical concepts, after awhile I got the impression I was reading a Microsoft press release rather than an objective analysis of .NET. He seemed very uncritical of Microsoft's attempt to reinvent the Internet in their own image. There was little discussion of .NET's technical shortcomings, its potential impact on the developer community, nor of its corporate context: Namely, Microsoft's history of releasing bug-ridden, badly-planned software that later proves to have gaping security holes.Particularly amusing was Chapter 8's discussion of the My.NET architecture. Chappell raises the question of what would keep Microsoft from accessing and using Passport customer data without permission. His only answer is basically, ""Well, they wouldn't DO that. They'd get in trouble."" Yeah, right..."
2,Returned Book to store,"As a software engineer moving from VC++ to .Net and C#, I did not see the value in this book. Yes, I wanted to understand the .Net environment, but the pertinent subject matter contained in this book was readily available in other books such as ""Programming C#"" by Jesse Liberty.The first few chapters are OK, but the author drags on and subsequently put me to sleep. After covering the material that I was most interested in, he moves on to Web programming issues, which are not relevant to my work.To be honest, I read the first few chapters, skimmed the next few, saw the web info, and returned the book. Maybe I did not give it a fair shot, but I did not see it being useful reference material to hang on to as I navigate thru the world of .Net and C#."
2,Beats around the bush a lot!,"David Chappell got rave reviews for his old book ""Understanding ActiveX and OLE"" - which I second, whole heartedly. This book on the other hand is a confusing mess on what he wants to say. His explanation of what a web service is in the first chapter is mediocre. He goes round in circles explaning the same thing in different ways that make the explanations really confusing (chaps 4 and 5). This book needs work both in terms of the way he says it and the content itself. Chappell claims that this book is an overview. ...p"
2,Annoying!!!,"I bought this book because it is one of my favorite authors(Catherine Coulter) first forays into writing.... Her writing has much improved over the years from this one. Brent is a jerk with moments of maturity. Byrony is a simpleton who kinows her worth but can't or won't define it. I just didn't get this book. Yeah lots of sex and all that but it was like something that happened to her and not with her in mind. I would not recommend this book without letting the potential reader know that if you like to be bossed around, and told you are nothing but a vessel for a husband, you will love this book. Otherwise read at your own risk. I know this book is crap but I also know that this is a phenomenol author and this was merely a bump early in the road."
2,Review,"Although recognizably by the same author, this book is, unfortunately, like most sequels far inferior to the orginal (""The Talented Mr. Ripley""). It works as readable crime fiction, but does not rise much above it. A critic once noted that Ripley is unconvincingly rescuscitated as a happily married man in the sequels and I'd have to agree. You still might like it if you're expectations aren't too high."
2,Ripley's Slow Slow Game,"This book was my first acquaintance with Patricia Highsmith's Ripley; so I cannot compare it to others in the series. I hope they are better. I found ""Ripley's Game"" long and boring.I thought it took forever to get the story moving. Then there were a few good action scenes. Then back again to page after page of nothing happening. Then a few more good action scenes. Etc. etc. etc.It is very rare that I do not finish a book once I start reading it. I did complete ""Ripley's Game"" but it was a near thing."
1,Clown wig,"I bought this for a disco costume, it looks more like a clown wig, it is white and didn't glow in the dark =("
2,Not good quality,"This wig looks extremely matted and ragged. When I tried to gentle fluff it up the plastic hairs were coming out a lot. I wanted this for a black light party and It does glow under a black light and in the dark so it serves its purpose but for the price and considering it says ""deluxe quality"" on the package I'm pretty disappointed."
2,nice effort.....,"For a beginner this book might be of some interrest in that it shows you some basic hand and foot tecniques, and some wery basic sparring combinations (for training purposes only), but when dealing with the different types of blocks the author does not mention how the arms are being held prior to the actual blocking, somethinig that is essential for all beginners to know. As i said before, this can be fun for the beginning student or the one thinking about taking up classes, since there is not many books out there hwo represent themselfes as pure ITF Taekwon-Do books, but if you have been training ITF for six moonths or more you should rather put money aside to buy the condensed ITF Encyclopedia by General Choi Hong Hi..... For black belts and high ranking colour belts..... stay away from this book, it has nothing for you in it, ecxept nice pictures"
4,An Exaltation of Larks -review-,"I'm only in junior high, so adults who read this might not count my opinion, but I thought this book was so good! I couldn't put it down and I definitely can't say that for a lot of books. I agree its not the best I've EVER read, but Reed creates such an interesting and thought provoking synopsis that I was blowen away! This was actually fun to analyse! I've never read a book twice but I'm thinking of making an exception for this one, there's just so much I could of missed. I understand that older people have to sound more distinguished than authors, acting like this novel just lacked plot, flow or whatever and acting like they could write better, but sometimes your wrong. This was a good book, stop kidding yourself! For all of the rest of you out there...read this one!"
2,Well Written Twaddle; Leaves Reader Curiously Dispirited.,"The plot is a gloss on a silly time travel/transcendence of Universe theme; a half-smart quasi-Buddhist shtick that leaves one feeling empty and cheated when the story finally unfolds. Along the way we get some generic and purposeless sex, and a story that is supposed to be mysterious and edgy. I give the book a second star because the author writes well, and phrases his silly plot in good style. Perhaps a good rule for science fiction that dips into quasi-crystal channeling mysticism might be to embrace some final meaning, either dark or light. This book leaves one muddled and unhappy, not thoughtful or uplifted. I cannot reccomend the book, but the author writes well enough to deserve more chances."
3,I don't know how to take this book,"College boy girl chaser enters the Twilight Zone. Some very interesting things, some bedroom exploits that could have been skipped. This book will stay with you. The material seems like science fiction, but different from most sf."
2,"You must be talking about Melbourne, Florida, Mate","I don't know where our first reviewer is coming from, but he certainly doesn't know a damn thing about Melbourne, Australia. Buses stopping at 6pm? When? In the 1930s perhaps? Mate, if you have an issue with Australia or Australians, save it for some other place. This is meant to be a film review site, and if you know as much about films as you obviously DON'T know about Melbourne, then maybe you should post elsewhere, ...or at least be ignored as a xenophobic moron. By the way, for those interested, it's not a great film, but it's certainly watchable and, in case you didn't realise it, ...it's just a MOVIE! If you want to know about real life, visit the place :)"
1,Inflicted on the World,"This film is so Melbourne(Australia) Outer Suburbs that it is surreal. I first saw it in a Movie Festival with some decent horror films; god knows why this piece of trash was placed in that venue.What is most disturbing about this film is that the Melbourne Suburbs, especially the Dandenong area, is very much like what the film is like. As bad as BODY MELT is, at least it does not try and depict the extremely depressing reality of Melbournes suburbs where even the buses stop running at around 6pm.I go to films to escape this kind of reality.If you really want to discover how depressing , mundane and boring life in the Melbourne, Australia, ""burbs"" is, then get this... or rent it.What a downer that this piece of trash is out in the world. Even BODY MELT is better than this film."
5,One Size Does Fit All!,"In My Sister's Shoes is not just another self-help book. It touches on real life situations that every woman has experienced in one way or another. The selections let you know that someone else has walked in your shoes; it gives another way of looking at your situation; most of all it lets you know that there is always hope. The recommended songs, reading passages, and scriptures add life to the content of each selection. This book is a worthy addition to anyone's collection--women and men!"
4,Sharing to Enrich,"Jetola Anderson-Blair's ""In My Sister's Shoes"" is a rich collection of short stories that makes you reflect, laugh, and enjoy the process of growth in a sister's life. The book encourages you to go after your dreams and learn from your past. It doesn't judge or excuse behaviors -- just motivates you towards constructive change. The quotes from her grandmother show Jetola to be wise, because a wise person learns from those who have gone before her. I am looking forward to her next work, because it engerized me to keep moving towards my dreams."
5,"Uplifting, Inspirational, and Encouraging","Sometimes we all need a pat on the back or just a word of encouragement. ""In My Sister's Shoes"" fills the prescription! It's a very small book with a lot of uplifting stories. It makes the perfect gift for your ""best-sister-girlfriends!"""
5,"When You Are In The Mood For Some ""Alone"" Time","There are so many wonderful things about this book. It is a great easy Saturday or Sunday Afternoon read. I picked it up one Saturday afternoon when I was in a mood for some ""alone"" time and I just could not put it down. This book takes you through a wide range of emotions, sometimes you'll laugh because you remember doing or saying exactly what the character in the story did. You'll find yourself saying ""oh yes I rememebr doing or saying that."" I loved the bible readings and songs after each story. Other times you see things your friends did and you wondered why you had not thought of responding to them in the same manner as the character in the story did. Nothing too heavy, just a nice ""think about this"" or ""remember this"" book."
4,Cari Barnes's review,"Jetola,I have thoroughly enjoyed your book. It has been inspirational to me and it really hit home. Keep up the good work."
1,product didn't work out,"The product wasn't what we ordered. we received covidien brand which didn' fit' Cocidien took over from kendall, but the product didn't work out. WE HAVE RECEIVED A REFUND, and are happy now with the way the refund was handled"
4,"ITS OK,","The quality sock it's ok, soft and thin, and the delivery very fast. But the image it not the same that you expect receive. Did not have a tiptoe and heel. I brought it for my mom, and she said it's ok for the surgery and when you stay in bed for long time."
1,disgusted,"My mdse was listed incorrected. Nowhere in the discription did it say anything about a peekaboo toe. These stockings are for people who can't walk and need their feet checked. I on the other hand need the stocking for walking, so the hole in the bottom of the stocking makes them unuseable for me. The mdse did not come with an order form or a return slip. So when I went back to Amazon online, to see what i had to do to return the hose, I found a phone number where you could reach the company. After many attempts and messages, no one ever contacted me from this company. I have since put a claim into my credit card, and maybe someday I'll be able to get the hose I need."
5,"Zantrex, good stuff","I always use these types of drugs for energy boosts, not as a daily supplement for weight loss. One capsule will keep you alert with no noticeable effects, where 2 will give you that jittery feeling for an hour or so. If taken before exercise, I tend to feel extremely warn out afterwards, but in a good way, like it just really enhances the burn. My water in take definitely increases when I take it. As far as other types of similar drugs, this pretty much falls in line with the rest."
1,Thought I was tripping!,My daughter tried this stuff first and hated it. It made her feel sick but also disoriented. She was trying to read a magazine but couldn't understand a word of it. She gave them to me and I took one before heading off to a meeting. I was asked to take the minutes but really struggled to concentrate to do so. I suddenly felt so jittery and dizzy. I couldn't focus on any object or understand what was being said. I was afraid I would have a heart attack or something. I had a very disoriented and disconnected feeling. Thank God I wasn't driving! This is definately not a good product for many people.
2,"1st Day I took Zantrex 3, Ephedrine Free Dietary Supplement,Capsules",The first day I took this I thought I was about to pass out.I got real hot and then my ears felt like they needed to pop. My throat felt like it was going shut I was trying to cough and couldn't. Then my neck started itching bad.Then the rest of the day I just had a huge headache.Then that night I felt exhausted! Like I was coming down w/ the flu or something.
1,my sister is in the hospital after taking xantrex,"My sister took 2 pills a day for only 2 days, she has stopped taking it for another 2 days and is now hospitalzed. She still has chest pain, shaking, and difficulty breathing and swallowing. She was perfectly healthy before taking xantrex3"
1,"did not work for me, useless","I used this for 2 months, nothing happened I did exercise as well. All this thing did was made me sick to the stomach and feel nausea all day and sleep loss"
1,To jittery,"I chose this rating because I threw the bottle away after 4 dys of use. I am not sensitive to caffeine or products with high caffeine content but I had terrible headaches during my 4 dys of use! They started on first day of use and stopped once I discontinued use. I prefer green teas pills but thought I would try something new, bad choice."
5,Ecstacy-light,"Really, though, this stuff is like an amphetamine. I used to work in fast-food, and one of my co-workers was taking this. She'd share with me and we would be the most hard-working smiley girls in the store. I'd take this stuff just for recreation.I bought my own supply of it later, and I lost 30 lbs in 2 months. My only exercise was my 20 min commutes to and from work. My friend lost 40 lbs, but she was actually going to the gym.I saw a lot of negative reviews regarding nausea and insomnia, but I don't think the nausea affects everyone, and who sleeps these days anyway?"
2,Not for everyone!,"I agree with the person who wrote the very long review about it. Try starting to lose weight with something else. I'll tell you why.I personally need to lose over 50 lbs, I started with this, and have lost NO WEIGHT!!! Maybe for some people it does work, but not for me. I didnt exercise with it so maybe thats why it didnt work, thats why I gave it two stars.But the REAL POINT of my review, is that they specifically say to take these and you dont need diet and exercise, well they are totally MISLEADING!! I guess I should have used COMMON SENSE to realize you always need diet and exercise to lose weight.But I might go try XENADRINE!! Cause I have used that in the past and lost over 35lbs, I will go with what I know works."
3,IT WORKS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD...,"THIS PILL DOES CURB YOUR APPETITE FOR ABOUT 7 HOURS.IT SAYS TO TAKE 3 TIMES A DAY BUT I ONLY TAKE IT IN THE AM AND IT GETS ME THROUGH THE ""MUNCHY ACHES""AT WORK.IVE NEVER USED ANY OTHER APPETITE SUPPRESSANT SO I HAVE NOTHING TO REALLY COMPARE IT TO.I DONT THINK ITS BURNING ANY FAT BUT IT DOES STOP THE GLUTTONY."
1,Heart attack in a bottle,"This stuff is horrible... I took it for about 3 weeks and couldn't take the side effects anymore. The dizziness, the pounding heart (felt like I was having a heart attack), the floating/trippy feeling, unable to sleep... and when you stop taking it for a day or two, you get a 24/7 pounding headache. I stopped taking the medicine about a week ago, and I am still getting dizzy spells randomly. HORRIBLE!! I would NEVER recommend this to anyone."
1,you will die,"DO NOT.....DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTIt has given me the worst headaches, and has given ME A RASH!!!i have taken diet pills before, but THIS BLOWS YOUR STOMACH AND YOUR HEAD.I HAVE NEVER HAD HEADACHES THIS INTENSE, NOR STOMACH ACHES THIS BAD.I do not want to lose weight this bad."
1,I miss Ephedrine :(,"This drug makes me extremely nauseated. I took it about 5 hours ago and I'm still shaky and it's a really odd feeling, hard to describe. It did give me energy, but I'd rather have a few cups of coffee than experience this weird sick to my stomach feeling. I even took it on a full stomach! Don't waste your money."
3,ok,worked with the energy in the beginning of taking it but seemed to have become immune to the energy effects.
2,"Yes, it really works, but not without negatives!","After seeing my best friend rapidly lose 15 pounds in a week and a half, I asked her secret and she told me Zantrex. Mind you, I was already on Tight! Which is great, but I was being greedy and wanted to lose weight faster. I started taking the recommended dosage a day and my heart was palpitating like CRAZY; To the point that while I was CASUALLY walking, I had to stop and hold my chest.--a HUGE red flag. I suddenly knew why she lost weight--it was because of the nausea. I felt nauseous almost all the time on Zantrex. I could not look at food without feeling like crap and whenever I did indeed eat, I felt even worse. Did I lose weight? YES! I lost 17 pounds in two weeks, but, it's not worth feeling like your heart is about to explode."
4,"Satisfied, more or less","I've been taking Zantrex 3 Fat Burner for about 2 weeks now and I've lost maybe 5 pounds. It's great as an appetite suppressor. I take two capsules in the morning, drink lots of water, eat maybe a granola bar or two for breakfast and that's all I need until lunch where I'll take two more capsules and have something small like a salad. If you don't mind a product that makes it so you just don't feel like eating, it's great. I almost never feel like eating dinner and when I do it's just some soup or something small. Whereas before I was chowing down like a pig.I recommend this to anyone who's problem is over-eating."
3,Same Old Stuff,Same as any other pill on the market. Didn't notice a difference in my energy level or my appetite. Just another fad :-(
1,If you want to be....,"sick and homicidal all day, then this is the product for you. Tried this stuff to drop a few pounds and found myself sick as a dog, bloated out, and murderously angry. Even my coworkers thought I was on something and I was taking ONE a day! Does not help lose weight as I was running 20 miles a week and eating less (probably because I wanted to vomit all the time) and gained about 5 pounds. Returned to GNC and got my money back.Decided to run three times a week vice five and to try Atkins again and was down nine pounds and four inches in a week. You can keep these so-called ""supplements."""
2,ugh,"Ugh Do I get my money back seeing bad reviews. N was tld on the box that i didnt have to work out or follow a diet well thats a lie. When i opened the box it said something so different, that u need to work out n follow a diet. They just did that sou would buy it, experincing a uead ach now feels like i wasted money just to lose weight n im not that big..please work will follow up in two wks."
2,Not for just a few pounds...,"I tried this product hoping to get that extra boost I needed to shed those last 5 pounds. While I did feel a slight boost of energy, this product did nothing to increase amount of weight I was losing in addition to my already established routine. Although I will say to this product's credit, I did not feel in the slightest bit ill or sick after taking it."
1,Should be illegal,"Don't buy it. Just don't. Suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety attacks, heart palpitations, panic, and extreme nausea just aren't worth shedding a few pounds."
1,Scare of a lifetime.,"I took this product after a friend of mine and I were talking about weight lose methods of the stars (article she read) She thought it was an ad. Anyway, I went out and bought some to try. The first dosage as directed at breakfast, within 15 minutes I had rapid heartbeat, my skin felt itchy and red and I had a terrible headache. I took some benedryl for the itch and redness and tylenol for the headache. I felt bad for 2 days. I do NOT recommend."
2,Too many jitters,"I have found another product that I want to recommend. It's called Alert and is sold by consultants like Avon, but you can also go the Starlight website and order it. It's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters, and as a bonus I don't feel hungry when I'm using it. They also have a product specifically for weight loss. I have tried that as well. I did feel a bit jittery at first... but it settled after a week or so of taking it. I would recommend it also. I used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs. I did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss, but I credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings.I'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what I need ... energy and hunger control and it's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so I now use it. I've used this for years and have not had any problems."
2,??,Really didn't do anything for me. Maybe I need to invest more time but I really like stuff that at least makes me feel like it is working and doesn't just give me a little bellyache.
4,DON'T use as directed- use LESS,BASED on MY personal experiences- VERY IMPORTANT:i took this and lost 15 lbs after Having a baby...i first used as directed and it made me very shaky and sick feeling- but the key to that is to only take 1 dose or even half of that dose - 15 mins before breakfast and DRINK LOTS OF WATER and dont forget to EAT if you dont it will make you fell like vomiting...it will give you plenty of energy to EXCERCISE and clean...best if taken before vigorous activity - if you take it and then sit on the couch - you will feel sick - its not a miracle pill but if you take care of yourself and decrease dose and stay active it does wonders - and dont forget to drink A LOT of water!!
1,Only take this if you need....,"an extra push. I didn't see it as a helpful dietary supplement. I was mostly hyper all day, with no weight loss.Earlier this month, I was preparing to move and I needed more energy, I took two blue Zantrex-3 pills and I was up for at least 24 hours. But when I came down, I basically crashed.During the two weeks I took the pills I did not see any weight loss results, but around 7pm at night, I would feel jittery, like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. In addition, my coworkers thought I was on illegal drugs because I was so wired.I decided to stop taking the capsules and have just been trying to fight the battle of the bulge with diet and exercise."
1,Please Pass this one up.,"Not only did i get sick, have nausea whenever I took it, but also the tension headaches were draining. It causes nausea, headaches and attitudes (how can anyone feel pleasant on this?) Any recommendations for something that really works without making you miserable?"
3,It works...but at a price,"This product does what it promises. You definitely lose weight when you use it. BUT, after using it you feel horrible, especially 10 minutes after you eat. You get very nervous and nauseated. I hate it and love it at the same time because it has definitely helped me lose weight but while I'm under its influence I swear I will never take it again because it makes me feel so sick. However, I always go back to it when I need to lose some weight. No wonder Britney Spears was seen with this stuff, its a miracle worker if you can stand the reaction."
1,VERY dangerous,"While I was taking this I was sweaty, sleepless, cranky, and shaky. I had cheast pains and heart palpitations. And the crash is terrible. However I did loose 20lbs of water weight in 2 days. I loved that i lost weight so fast but it's sooo unsafe and unhealthy. Don't risk it."
4,test the number of pills you should use,"I have used this pill off and on and they really work. One pill lasts me all day...I dont need to take it with every meal. I actually made a test today and took two and I did feel like I was high....you just have to test how many can you stand.no pill is a miracle pill, YOU DO NEED TO EXERCISE TO SEE RESULTS AND EAT PROPERLY...."
2,Eh,"I had high hopes based on previous reviews. I took half the recommended dose, solely because I never take stuff like this and wasn't sure how my body would respond. It didn't give me energy, it just made me jittery and hungry. Shipping was fast, I just didn't like the product all that much."
2,Not recommended,"fior me personally, this product was ineffective and unhealthy. The only thing it did for me was suppress my hunger at certain times. This product comes with a price physically so be aware of what your getting into. I read the other reviews and thought it wouldn't happen to me but it did. I had terrible withdrawals from this and I was sick for a week with severe constipation (sorry for the weak stomached). Try at your own risk."
1,OW!,"I took this product this morning because I was looking for an energy boost. Bad idea! Even with taking the recommended amount of water, it gave me a terrible headache that lasted most of the day. This product also makes my stomach hurt REALLY bad!! I also can't sleep on this product....at all. Do not take if you are sensitive to caffeine! I only took 2 pills this morning...over 17 hours ago and I can't sleep."
4,Does what its supposed to people!,"The younger generation, or people in good health should be perfectly fine taking the recommended dose, unless your allergic to some of the ingredients. Yes, it makes you naseous. Yes, it makes you bouncy and wired. Its a caffiene pill, what do you expect?! If you want to lose weight bad enough, you deal with it. As you take it you should get used to it. I felt like crap taking it for the first time yesterday, but then I took it this morning and I'm completely fine. Just as long as you drink a lot of water with it, which you should do on a daily basis anyways, it will work. Exercise, eat healthy, take the recommended dose, and wala!"
1,Not My Cup of Tea,Not much to say about this product except that it made me sick. The first couple days I felt nothing from taking the product and then I started feeling sick every time I took it. Maybe it will work for you but for me it was a waste of money and almost sent me to the hospitial.
1,"too much caffeine, bad side effects.","This pill made me SO anxious, and horny ALL day! I also was not able to sleep. I had nothing to do in the middle of the night but I could not fall a sleep. I was horny without having my bf around. It was a torture. I ended up eating food around like 4am because I was so bored and couldn't sleep."
1,Sucks,"I used to take Hydroxy once in a while to drop a couple of pounds. I run, exercise and eat low cal. I am 5'5"" and used to weight 125lbs. I wanted to drop 5 for summer and instead gained 5lbs in three days on this pill.Don't take it. I am bloated and feeling gross"
5,I lost weight on it,I do only use it for energy boosting in the mornings. One in the morning and one in the early evening. Two at a time makes you feel wired! It is a great helper when you do tread or other cardio for lasting longer. No pill does it by itself but if you eat right (Atkins) and exercise the pounds will go away.
1,Scary Stuff,"This is scary stuff, I took the recommended dose and felt dizzy, super shaky and like I was going to black out. I was afraid to be alone in case something happened to me. The weird thing is it took about 3 hours to affect me. I dumped the whole bottle in the trash. This is nothing but pure speed. Too risky in my opinion."
4,Really Excellent but Unreliable,"We've had 2 of these for about 6 years and they are truly wonderful to use. Very high, very low (won't burn chocolate) and instantly controllable. However, there are some real problems. The much advertised temperature control feature doesn't work at all, but they are so controllable that this isn't really a big issue. More worrying though is that we've had 2 failures on 1 unit and 1 failure on the other. Cooktek service is excellent (although not cheap), but that's a lot of failures."
2,To Reader from USA,"I would just like to commend you for your insightful review of Spawn. I began to collect in 92', and quit shortly. I thought of looking into the series again, but after reading your review, you helped me relive what I felt seven years ago. Thanks."
5,The start of it all. A must read for all comic fans!,"This book is the beginning of MacFarlane's Spawn dynasty. It is also the beginning of the graphic masterpiece that is Spawn. It slowly takes grasp of you, and wraps you in the plight of Al Simmons, a.k.a. Spawn. This is a great way for new fans to get the early issues (1-5), or even for us comic vets who want to have all five in one convenient package! Also recommended, Spawn books 2-6. Believe me, it will hook you!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Spawn got old, pretty quickly, but was ok at the start. I was never a fan of McFarlane, so probably part of the problem right there. It does have going for it the fact that that Spawn is not your corn fed white boy, mid-American billionaire playboy, or other such type of character, however. Even if they did burn the crap out of him in hell."
1,Do NOT buy this product,"It may look good, but this system is a waste of money. I've had 2 of these systems and had problems with both. The first system lasted 6 weeks before the dvd player started malfunctioning. I exchanged it for a replancement. Alas, the second system lasted 7 months before it started making an amazingly loud grinding noise in the base unit (NOT the dvd player). Unfortunately my only recourse now is to send it back to Philips who 1)won't pay the shipping 2)can not guaratee that I will get a new product in return 3) will not extend the warranty on the 3rd replacement unit. Purchase at your own risk."
2,Sing Along Songs - Campout at Walt Disney World,"I purchased all 3 items. The other two are wonderful. This one contains great songs for the kids. Unfortunately, two of the songs are not playing properly. They skip as if there are scratches. We did not do this because we have only played it once and the other two are fine. I am not going through the process of returning it. It isn't worth the time and postage. I am really disappointed."
2,Could have been better,It is kinda boring and can so tell it was made in the late 80's 90's. I found it unanimated. My son is losesing intrest in like 10 min.
3,Just Okay,"I bought this DVD hoping to help my 16 month old twins get used to Disney characters for our trip to Disney World in May. I thought singing along with the characters would be fun. The DVD was just okay, I was not ""wow-ed"" by it.My biggest issue is the number of previews for other Disney DVDs at the beginning of the DVD. I didn't time it exactly but it was more than 5 minutes...I had to skip to Chapter 6 on the DVD to see the actual video we bought the DVD for.The words to the songs are at the bottom of the screen like subtitles. There are lots of olderrkids (grade school age) from different ethnic backgrounds that are happy and singing, and a good mix of boys and girls. They do show several Disney characters (Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and his nephews). As one previous reviewer noted it is exclusively at Fort Wilderness campsite but that fits with the theme of the DVD."
2,JUST ok!,This edition is just ok compared to other mickey sing along movies. Disney world mickey is the best followed by haunted halloween.
5,Let's go Camping!!!,"While we're going camping, we're going to have some songs and fun and dancing, and excitement, and all the rest.This video ranks high up there with the ""live action"" ones, what with the Sing Along gang joining in with Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Chip and Dale, and the others in a fun fest which brings you on a tour of many of the sights of Discovery Island and River Country. Donald Duck is there camping out, as is Goofy, and the sight of him water skiing is worth the price of the video. (He's actually quite good!!!)Then there are the songs - many from years before, such as ""The Caissons Go Marching Along,"" ""Don't Fence Me In,"" ""Mountain Greenery,"" and when the dancers do ""Turkey in the Straw,"" it's a real hoot, and our two twin girls want to get up and dance and dance and dance....A terrific addition to any collection!!!"
2,Not like they used to be!,"I bought this sing-a-long not only because I love Disney sing-a-longs but because I'm planning a trip to Disney World and seeing as how the ""Disneyland Fun"" sing-a-long shows great footage of Disneyland, I thought this would do the same for Disney World. But it doesn't. It shows no footage of any park or any resort other than the Fort Wilderness campground. Also, it doesn't even have classic Disney songs. Instead is has songs like ""We'll be Comin' Around the Mountain."" Maybe for young kids it is good but it was extremely disappointing for me!"
3,Sing a long songs with mickey,This DVD is quite short and a little old fashioned but cute none the less for ages 5 and below I think.
4,"If Rio was the best, this is surely a close second!","Coming from someone who used to hate this band with a passion when they first came out believe me I'm surprised myself at how well this and Rio has stood the test of time. This version has been very, very well remastered and packaged in a gatefold sleeve with a cd booklet that has all the lyrics as well. The sound has never been better and actually sounds like a very decent debut effort. ""Girls On Film"" is a New Wave classic and will continue to be for some time. What I've discovered now too is how good the band is. The bass player is fantastic with all the running bass runs that he does. The rest of the album sounds a lot like an old Visage or Ultravox album but that's to be expected as this first came out at the height of the New Wave fad. If you are a Duran Duran fan and want to get the best version of this album that's out there, this is it!"
4,Very decent 2-channel component amplifier,"I bought this amplifier about 4 years ago and had it in my car pushing a set of 6.5"" Elemental Design components. This amplifier does a better job at pushing its rated power than a lot of the ""pawn shop junk amps"" at about the same price. I have no doubts that it puts out its rated power. It's a pretty decent amplifier for the money and drove my components well. I also hooked it up to a little 8"" sub for my truck and it pounded the heck out of that subwoofer. I would say that if definitely drives my sub every bit as hard as my old school 250 watt rockford fosgate amplifier -- and you guys know that those old amps pushed out WELL above their rated power. I wouldn't hesitate to buy or recommend another PG product!"
2,Disappointing!,"I was very disappointed in this CD, as it contained not the moving and sentimental tunes I expected of this composer, but JAZZ INTERPRETATIONS of these tunes. 'I Will Wait for You,' in particular, sounded like it was being pounded on a piano by an amateur. Jazz lovers may appreciate this CD, but if you are searching for the melodies that made these works so memorable, keep looking."
3,Legrand not so grand,"It's not Amazon's fault, but I was totally disappointed with this Legrand CD. I had thought it would be the songs popularized in the late '60's and '70's and recorded by various voices. Instead, it is Legrand at the piano, and that's it. Boring, unfortunately."
4,THE WAY IT SHOULD BE!,"JON IS BACK WITH A CLASSIC SAVATAGE SOUNDING EFFORT! EVEN IN THE LINER NOTES HE STATES ""I WANTED TO GO TO A PLACE I HAVEN'T BEEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME"". I SAY WELCOME BACK MR. OLIVA, WE'VE MISSED YOU! NOT TO KNOCK SAVATAGES RECENT RELEASES, BUT THEY'VE GOTTEN A BIT LOST IN THE ORCHESTRATION. THIS CD IS NOT VOID OF THE CLASSICAL ARANGMENTS, BUT THE METAL OUT-SHINES THEM. THIS CD IS IN THE VEIN OF ""DOCTOR BUTCHER"", BUT NOT AS ANGRY! WHY THE 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5? THE LEAD GUITAR WORK ISN'T STELLAR! IT'S NOT BAD, BUT IT'S NOT AT THE LEVEL WE'VE BECOME USED TO WITH THE LIKES OF THE LATE MR. OLIVA, ALEX, CAFFERTY, OR PITRELLI. WITH THAT, LIKE THE LINER NOTES SAY ""SIT BACK AND ENJOY A RIDE"" ROCK ON JON! HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON AS WELL!"
1,WHAT IS THIS?,"I've been a fan of Savatage for many years and this is something that doesn't remind me of them at all. I don't mind change, change is good but this is just something awful. Now I understand why Zakk Stevens got rid of these people, (All memebers beside Jon were in Circle to Circle, check them out!) they probly wanted this to be the next CTC CD and that would have been a huge mistake sophmore release. Jon doesn't sing on this cd, he just screams. If I wanted to hear someone scream at me I'd stand in the middle of the street in NY somewhere. Every members solo stuff in now or out of Sav I have enjoyed from TSO, CTC, CC, and the new jazz sounding band formed with Middleton, Al, Al's wife but this is just awful stuff. Go back to the studio for the next 4 yrs and maybe you'll get it right next time. When I buy the next JOP album I'll wait till I can find it used and then I'll buy if it's below $1.99."
1,Not Up To Savatage Standards.....,"If you're expecting a return of ""The Moutain King"", forget it. This is not up to Savatage standards, and I was very mislead by many of the reviews here saying it was a return of sorts. It's not even close....This is more of your typical J. Oliva, ""A Night At The Opera"" kind of stuff. I don't like this direction at all. It's not Heavy Metal, and when I think of Savatage or J. Oliva for that matter, Metal is usually the word that come to mind. Not here...J. Oliva's best work minus Savatage is still with Dr. Butcher. Those are the real roots of Savatage IMO. This solo effort leaves me tired and uninspired....AVOID."
2,The list of ing.,The list of ingredents goes on for a while. If you want a everyday cookbook keep looking. I will not make to many of these dishes. A lot of work to prepare them. Nothing that gets me inspired. A waste of my money. To bad.
1,Time for a burial,"If you dream in sugar and saccharine, fine, but this is terribly melodramatic with very flat characters and action that is largely unbelievable. Give it a miss. Who is dredging up these dead things?"
4,Definitely worth checking out,"this is a Really good cd... i originally bought the cd because i really liked the song If There's Any Justice, which is one of my favorites on the cd. Lemar has a Really nice voice, i'm not sure who to compare his voice to...you just have to listen to the cd to see for yourself.There are some songs i like more than others but Time to Grow, Feels Right, and What If are my other favorites...There's a good variety of songs, some upbeat and some mellow and slow... the lyrics in the songs are really good too."
1,Disgraceful condition,This book was supposed to be in good condition. It was in fact disgraceful. The book was chewed on each corner. Don't purchase from this seller. I dread to think what average conditions means to them.
3,Should have checked Amazon,"If you type in chafing fuel on the Amazon search bar, you'll find a 3 count of 2.6 ounce chafing fuel. Hope this helps."
2,Reply to Stella,"I had the same problem when I purchased a similar product. Great idea, but hard to come by the fuel. If you go to [...], they make the 2.6 oz chafing fuel and you can click on a list of places that sell there products. You should also call ahead to make sure that they have that size in stock. I hope this works for you, it did for me."
5,superior mining book for kids,"I loved this book! The way it explains the difference between lode mining and placer mining alone was excellent. The drawing and explainations of the stamp mill and how the gold is separated from the rock is my favorite part. There is also background on mining towns, miner lives, and areas mined. Drawings and explainations of how cradles, long toms, panning and sluice boxes work. This book is the cornerstone of my Gold Rush Unit. I have purchased 35, so my entire class can read them together. Wonderful and just right for 4th grade."
2,Topic updates needed,"Recommend that the author review and edit the section on West Nile, to be certain that it expresses the facets of this very active topic clearly and accurately."
5,Secret Agent,"Joseph Conrad penetrates bluntly question humanity and faith in God. Helpless idiot brother and his fragile protector struggle to carry burden of their destiny only to be murdered by two hatred-driven anarchist. Grand are souls who sacrifice the harmless for the altar of their worshipping greedy ideology. Miserable are innocents who wind up the killed. Conrad narrows down our uviversally common question:Does God play good or evil on us? An innocent idiot and her fragiles sister could not sustain their low-profile life despite their utmost, respectable perseverance. A piece of anarchist walked away with all the wealth of the victims. God's cruel demand on innocent blood from scapegoat and his reward for the unscruplous. No sense of justice is found. Just God's joke on human sense of morality."
1,Buy another edition!,"Wanting to re-read this modern classic after some decades, in the course of a second visit to Conrad's writing, I made the mistake to buy this Signet edition.Don't do that! It sucks. The print is compact and the letters too small. It has no explanatory notes, which would be important for this kind of book. It is a punishment to read this.Stay away from this edition and buy the Oxford World Classics pocket book instead.I will review that shortly."
5,Secret Agent,"Again Conrad shows his adroitness at developing a plot. Not only was Conrad a gifted storyteller but he is equally adept at both charcater develpoment and descriptiveness. The Secret Agent is the story of a double agent who becomes a pawn,not only of the government he supposedly represents but with the British officials who have turned him. Trying to impress his handlers, he decides to plant a bomb that ends in tragedy for his own family.Conrad's portyal of anarchists as a bumbling lot with their own self serving agenda is the important point that is characteristic of all of Conrad's woks.The Secret Agent is not a stylishly written as Nostromo and lord Jim and is a bit faster paced. It also contains a somewhat comedic tone which is unlike Conrad's other works. What i appreciate most about Conrad is that he writes with all the talent and descriptiveness of other great authors but he is also a greta storyteller."
5,A very uninteresting book,"This book makes me sick because it contains few actions but many, even too, too many descriptions on these too few actions although the author was able to use so many uncommon words to show his ability in describing something.Such endless descriptions are tortures for anyone who reads this 5-page action novel. I really wonder if I need to read other books by this author."
2,Unless you like your books long and exhausting....,"....skip this one. Conrad takes perverse pleasure in his chapter-long descriptions and flowery phrases. The plot makes some guest appearances, but not many. Trust me, there's better use for your money elsewhere."
1,Just plain confusing,"Have you ever listened to a conversation and had no idea who or what the people are talking about? This is the feeling i got from this book. The complete frustration of not QUITE understanding who was who, or what was going on. Conrad's style of language really doens't help matters. Some classic books get better with time (Great Expectations, for example) but this just seems dated and from another, rather confusing period of history."
3,"Good book, bad edition","This is an excellent introduction to Conrad - a bit confusing and dense in places, but not nearly as much so as his better-known Heart of Darkness, and with a situation that most people can more easily fathom. The diversity of characterization and the clash of various fanatical ideals makes for a good storyline.That being said, it is a pity that the publishers of this edition decided to include an essay, bound at the front of the book, that totally gives away the only 'plot twist' worthy of the name in the entire story. This 'foreward' should have been placed after the text. Buy this book, but in a different edition."
4,Interesting,"At first I thought this was a serious book about Anarchist revolutionaries, and Verloc's duties as a secret agent. Then it all goes wrong and you realize that the whole book, about 200 pages of reading was all kind of a big joke on Mr.Verloc, and anarchists in general. Its worth a read."
2,"Joseph, what happened?","As a die-hard Conrad fan, I was disappointed by The Secret Agent, which seemed to try too hard to be ironic. Conrad is best in character studies, such as Lord Jim, and this plunge into political satire does not suit him. I love to make fun of socialists and anarchists as much as the next person (since, you know, they believe the same things when their ideologies are contradictory), and Conrad really wants us to feel contempt for the characters. Mostly, however, I felt indifference. There are some witticisms in here, and I enjoyed Stevie, the ""slow"" brother of Mrs. Verloc. Overall, however, Conrad was best at sea. Everyone should read Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim, and if you appreciate those, try Chance and Victory. But don't look to this book for an accurate or flattering representation of Conrad."
1,So slow! It's so descriptive that I fell asleep,"This book is so descriptive that you would fall asleep reading. Everything drags on and on. As a high school student, I wouldn't recommend it. Even though my teacher taught me not to judge a book that has been admired by people for more than a century, Im gonna say it; It's so boring!!!"
1,Do not read this book. Conrad fails in this genre.,Who would have thought the author of Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim could write such a weak novel? Unless you have to read all of Conrad's work stick to his better known and far better works
1,A bit pants really,"Most Victorian novels seem to maintain a certain charm, even if they do not retain any real relevence to today's society. This book, written with the intention of shocking early 20th century Britain, has no charm whatsoever. It does not make up for it in relevence either. In fact I do not believe this story has ever held any relevence to anyone, anywhere.It is a short, clumsy attempt of a story about anarchists and their attempts to upset the establishment. The bomb attack goes wrong and everyone thinks twice about the use of force. Nothing else really happens.It is simply terrible. Thank God it is little more than a short story."
5,Terrific Book,"I love to read sonnets, and this is a book of sonnets. I also love the Psalms, and this is a paraphrase of the first 41 psalms of the Bible. They are extremely well done. I will certainly recommend this book to all my friends and relatives!"
4,Lowepro Z20 Pouch (Black),"Not only handy, but helps save the finish on the beautiful Olympus Stylus Zoom 115 QD Champagne camera!"
3,"Another ""Hidden in the Vatican Library"" Story",It is too bad that the Reverend W.D. Mahan really did not shelter a Mr Whydaman in the winter of 1856 who really had seen the documents found in Mahan's book. It would be wonderful to read an authentic interview of the Three Shepherds. It would be wonderful to read an authentic report of Pontius Pilate to Caesar. And it would be wonderful to read the report of Caiaphas concerning the execution of Jesus... if these documents were authentic._The Acts of Pilate_ begins with transcripts of letters between Mahan and Whydaman wherein Mahan pretends to procure transcripts of copies from the Vatican. Mahan did his homework fairly well. He includes some authentic details. However there are some flaws as noted by Edgar John Goodspeed in _Strange New Gospels_ (pub 1931).
2,useless book for STUDYING continuum mechanics,"Maybe it has some use for reference, but for first time studying, this book is too concise to really explain things clearly for readers.Besides, the notation is also not in accordance with that used by today's researchers.Don't buy it. Buy Malvern's book instead. 'Introduction To The Mechanics Of A Continuous Medium' is the best book for studying this subject and also for future reference."
2,Not a Reference Book,"I originally bought this book as a reference when I was taking my FEA graduate school course to supplement some of the concepts, namely tensors. I found the book hard to follow since it did not have detailed examples worked out; this may be suitable for more advanced graduate level courses (i.e. doctorate level)."
3,A mathematical viewpoint,It's a mathematical viewpoint for continuum mechanics derived from linear algebra. Not very practical for engineers that don't need to prove the mathematics involved.
1,this thing doesnot last,"I bought this but although this claims to be 1000mAH, so far, it doesnot even last as long as the original 750mAh, also after a few weeks, even I left in the original charger, it wont last longer than 1 hour when I use my camera, avoid this item!"
2,There are MUCH better bks out there on this topic,"Written by two authors with no apparent training in this genre specifically, this work overly exaggerates family situations, delivering negative messaging in its examples. It reinforces gender stereotypes, assumes parents are quite prudish at times, and is heterosexist in places. It does have some strengths, however. The work provides sample Q&A, definitions, and suggested activities. It is also good at outlining where a child is at developmentally regarding issues that can come up."
5,practical and comprehensive,"Excellent book, addresses so many difficult questions that kids ask. Easy to read and to reference when the time is right."
1,Not Good,This is a terrible movie. Color me shocked. I love Jean Kerr (who wrote it) and Debbie Reynolds is one of my all-time favs. But Barry Nelson chews the scenery and Debbie is not much better spouting perfectly awful material. Don't waste your money!
5,"Entertaining, Compelling, Poignant &...oh yeah, Funny!","Just snapped this book up recently at a specialty bookstore & highly recommend it for anyone who is a Marx Brothers fan. Or an Algonquin Round table fan. Or an ""Old Hollywood"" fan. Anecdotes abound. But woven into the story is that of a diehard Groucho Marx buff who inhabits the tight, peculiar, often sad world of his last few years. Stoliar comes off as a decent guy with his heart in the right place, a relief since Groucho was surrounded by more than a couple of people with selfish ulterior motives towards him in the end. Erin Fleming, Groucho's companion in his last years, is intriguingly revealed as a complex, disturbing madwoman. Painfully sad read, but with the saving graces of humor & insight. Much of this was actually covered in Arthur Marx's book, but check out the different slant! I'm glad I read & own this book. I'll be back at it again."
5,WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO OWN ONE!?!?!,"I have owned and worked on just about every ladder made, over many years, and I have to say, this has got to be one of the safest, most stable ladders on the market. It's a tad bit heavy, but well worth the extra lugging.It does take a little to get used to, like I find myself debating as to which side to climb down when standing straddled over the top, and it is wider when folded up, using up more room in the construction trailer, but I plan to buy more over the years. I bought a 6 footer and plan to buy another along with two 8 footers. Very stable and works great to span scaffolding planks to. I highly recommend one, especially to any contractor."
1,Poor quality control,I received this ladder via freight and noticed while removing the strapping and edge protectors the side braces were not the same length. Opening the ladder one brace seems the correct length but the other appears to be for a ladder considerably taller causing the ladder to be unstable and unsafe. I am most disappointed with Werner's quality control as something like this should have been caught during the production/shipping process. And now I have the hassle of returning something this large.
1,damaged,I returned it becaused it was damaged...waiting for my credit card to be credited. One of the runners was smashed and cracked.
4,Video and Audio Extention Cable for Digital Camera,Bought this item for my father-in-law to use with this digital camera to connect to his console style TV. We have not tested this item yet however it appears to be good quality so I don't expect any problems. Price was inexpensive in any case and I quickly received this item when I ordered it.
3,Living by your own rules,"I liked this movie, because here we have Stella living by her rules and feeling comfortable in her skin...she is not a pretender.. very honest..trying to make life smoother among the rough cuts and fearless to live her sexuality without the labels that men put on women for being sexual..It was a refreshing movie about a woman, singleness, and having the courage to set your own standards for living...I liked this movie."
5,"Easy directions, helpful hints, storage tips, and more","Sondra Macdonald's Gourmet Dog Biscuits From Your Bread Machine will become an instant favorite with its easy directions, helpful hints, storage tips, ingredient lists, and both serious as well as whimsical recipes for dog biscuits that will taste better, prove fresher, are more nutritious, and cost less than the commercial brands.

1,SEASON FOR THE ORIGINAL B&B FANS!!,"I'm not a mainstream Beavis & Butthead fan...the fans that jumped on the bandwagon when they became popular. I was there from the beginning. Where the hell is FROG BASEBALL and BURGER WORLD. I want to see BURGER WARS!!!! There was a time when Beavis didn't even talk he just laughed (heh, heh, heh). Fire....Fire!!! I want Season 1,2,3. Just release them as Seasons....let us be the judge of what is good and what sucks. I want full episodes with videos included. EVERY TV SHOW IS LIKE THIS ON DVD. Why is this one different?! DEMAND FULL EPISODES AND FULL SEASONS!!!"
2,Box set 3 will be the last set...,"There is a preview in Box set #2 , in which he makes a commercial like that of BrokeBack Mountain in which he says the final 42 episodes on DVD in Set 3..Shame on you Mr. Judge.. only 120 episodes out of about 200+ are getting the DVD digital cut?in the words of your own created characters..you suck!! Rent it when it comes out 8/1/2006 and reminisce what a great show it was despite Fart-knocker Mike Judge limiting his release of titles..Mike Judge the ultimate tool..huh huh, he said tool!"
2,Well here we go again,So we're going to get the Beavis and Butt-Head Volume 2 Mike Judge Collection! I just hope this is better than the first volume. I hear all kinds of rumors that it will not have any episodes from the first 3 seasons so if that's true it's already starting off bad. I guess I will probably buy it though just to have all the extras and maybe a few eps I don't already have. I will be really glad when and if they ever release all the seasons uncut but I think that is a fantasy that will never come true. Oh well.
1,Typical: Not a single early episode,"It's nice to hear that Mike Judge has done away with cutting up the Beavis and Butt-Head episodes, butreally this DVD uscks. Not a signle episode made before Season 5 is included; Only episodes from seasons 5 6, and 7 are included thanks to that scumbag Mike Judge. He really should be locked up and never be allowed to participate in another DVD again."
5,I LOVE U BEVIS AND BUTTHEAD!!!,This is great collection. I only wish they had ALL the BEVIS and BUTTHEADs shows as well as ALL the music videos.
3,Love Beavis and Butthead,Disks all work fine and packaging is great. However the box was a little bent up when I had received it. It isn't a big deal though! That doesn't mean it's not watchable. Thank you! Beavis and Butthead are hilarious.
4,A quick note...,"Just a quick note on this excellent release : track 2 is ""Reborn Through Hate"", not ""Reborn Through Hell"". At least, that's how it is on my original issue cassette."
4,Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson meets Death Metal,"When I heard the song ""Spiral Dreams"" for the first time on a radio show, I really thought it was Iron Maiden with Bruce Dickinson singing in a growling, death metal fashion. All the elements that IM has (fast bass riffs, thin guitar sound, twin lead breaks) are right here. This is a great album. Its rawness will appeal to the old-school headbangers out there. Very cool. My only gripe about this album is that most tracks are kinda similar. Perhaps another IM trend? My picks are ""Reborn Through Hell"", ""Coma"" and ""Fried Alive"". Don't let the titles fool you, though, this is a very interesting mix of Iron Maiden's NWOBHM musical style with some thrash thrown in for kicks. Fans of Iron Maiden will love the musical similarity, and fans of thrash metal will love it for the lyrical content and solid musicianship."
3,"good bag, but...","The bag is good. However, my laptop only fits in if you remove the lateral padding. Advertizing should make it clear that the larger laptops Targus claims that fit in the bag really only do if you remove some of the padding. Wasn't too happy about that, but this is my only complaint. Happy about the rest."
4,A Masterpiece of a Forgotten Genre,"Though wildly popular in their time, (1890's-1910's), Marie Corelli's Mystical-Romantic novels are almost unknown now, as is the entire genre. A Romance of Two Worlds was her first novel, written in 1886, and one of her best. A strange mix of Victorian romanticism, science, spirituality, and feminism, the book details a turning point in the life of a female piano improviser (!) as she discovers occult knowledge from a Chaldean mystic and his beautiful, innocent sister. Though the book is thoroughly dated by now, it gains rather than looses charm from the cultural distance it evokes. This book may have also been an inspiration for the legendary Jazz artist, Sun Ra, who named a composition ""Romance of Two Planets"", and who would have found much to like about Corelli."
1,a romance of tow world,i had a hard time getting interested in this store. not sure if it was the writting or story. it was slow start.
1,Romance?,"I gave this book only one star, because not giving a star was not an option. This has got to be the worst book that I have ever read! There was no romance, unless you're in love with the ultimate Higher Power of the universe...which I am not."
5,perfect,the book made me realize that i was not alone in the things i feel. It is beautiful and left me hungry for more!
3,Just fine.,"For someone who is looking for a cheep quick solution, this is just fine. I use this with my mac mini for general computer work, itunes, and surfing the internet. For high end work, take the other reviewers advice."
4,"Good product, but not quite perfect","I bought this adapter to use with my Macbook Pro and an older TV I had at the time. It worked well, but the video always seemed a little distorted whenever I used it. It's still a decent product, but with all the newer technology available, it's much better to just use an HDMI adapter or plug it straight in to the computer."
2,not enough product information,The product information should indicate that this is a DVI-I adapter. It is not compatible with Apple's mini displayport to DVI adapter. Very annoying having to buy another adapter!
4,Great item for your nails,This item is great to save money from going out to have your own nails done. Now I can take care of my own while watching tv and leave money in my wallet; I should have ordered more for gifts.
1,Don't order,"Upon receiving this item I immediatly took it out the box to use. I should have left it there. You get one good use out of it and no more. The attachments does not stay in the tool. If I could find my receipt, I would send it back in a heart-beat.Mad hands in Clinton, Maryland"
3,Disaster Synopsis Book,"Nice looking book, but I was disappointed that only 2 or 3 pages were given to each disaster. While I recognize the task of covering 100 disasters obviously means large number of pages can't be written for each event, I did want to read more than just 2 pages. This fact was not mentioned in the sales description of the book. There is only one photo (printed, not a photo plate, which are clearer) per event, which was also a big disappointment. I paged through the book when I received it and decided to return it because of these things. Covering disasters from BC to current day also may not appeal to everyone."
3,"Great, except for those pesky factual errors","Very interesting book. Some entries begin with a portrayal from a fictional character that was involved in the disaster being discussed. However the author managed to make multiple mistakes throughout the book. He claimed the great Okeechobee hurricane had winds of 500 mph (which is, errrr, impossible) and many times mixes up the terms tsunami and storm surge (these are not the same thing!) among others. If your looking for just a quick guide on some famous disasters then this is fine, but if you know a bit about the subject it's not recommended."
5,Werner AC11 Stepladder Hanger,"This is a great, organizationaly product. Strong metal (no silly, breakable plastic) and can be used to hang other items. I also use it to hold my wooden clothes drying racks in my laundry room. Up and out of the way, more room to move. Werner, please keep making this product!"
5,The excellence continues,Another great book by Lynn Austin-it made the scriptures come alive. It is more than evident that the author did her homework historically and scripturally. Warning-this may ruin you for other Biblical historical fiction! It is absolutely excellent-well written and accurate.
5,Fantastic,I love this series! Lynn Austin captures this time of the Old Testament kings in a way that keeps you turning pages all night. You really get to know all the characters and it keeps you trying to remember how it all actually turned out. Great Biblical/Historical fiction. I got the 1st book free on Kindle and have since purchased the Kindle books for the next 3. Will be purchasing the last one in the series shortly.
5,Fantastic,Lynn Austin's books bring the old testament alive. This is a great story about a kings faith in Yahweh. Great read.
5,song of redemption,You need to read this series! It was extremely well written and the content was so revealing. You will not be sorry.
5,Great Historical Fiction,A riveting book in a historical fiction series that brings the Old Testament Kings to life.
5,Great book,"This was a great book, it is historical fiction based on 2 Chronicles, the life of King Hezekiah. It is the second book in the series, Chronicle of the Kings. Both books were hard to put down. I just ordered the third book and look forward to reading it. I would highly recommend what is turning out to be a fabulous series!"
5,I Recommend it!,"Ms. Austin has written another superb fictional story; one that stays close to Scripture. Not only does the author tell a good story, but she also causes the reader to examine his own relationship and commitment with the Lord. Song of Redemption is even better than Gods and Kings. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series."
1,Do not like this book at all!!!!!,"Lynn Austin is a talented writer. Unfortunately, the book is filled with sensual content and that is only after reading a quarter of the book--I could not get any further. This is supposed to be a Christian book? If so why do would a writer fill it with sexual seductions, rapes and gang rapes. This is not what I want when I read a novel.My recommendation: Do not read this book!!!!"
5,I loved this book.,"This book (the whole series, actually) was easy to read. I actually felt like I was a bystander in the story(s). I felt the emotion of the characters, saw the landscape, smelled the air, etc. I did not want to put the book down nor did I want the story to end. Wish there were more than 5 books in the series. My husband also read the books and we have had some enjoyable discussions about them (books)."
3,good story,enjoyed the book. am in the process of reading the full series. I would recommend this series to friends if asked
5,One of my all time faves,"I've had this for many many years.I have a good thousand jazz CDs, tapes, vinyl, etc.Of all of them, this is among my top 5 favorites.Also, I have always prefered to bop of the 50's & 60's over most other styles of jazz and, Diz was the master."
3,"Read ""Blue Eyes, Black Hair"" to understand this better","I thought that ""The Malady of Death"" was better that ""Blue Eyes, Black Hair"" in that it was shorter and more to the point, but if you want to read a more in-depth look at the same basic story line, then ""Blue Eyes, Black Hair"" brings insight into yet another atypical Duras romance even though it tends to drag on. If you like Duras, but want a book that flows easier, I recommend ""10:30 on a Summer Night."""
3,The answer is beware.,"Although Marguerite Duras is one of my favorite writers, I don't recommend buying this book... anywhere. It is so short you can read the entire book in a bookstore and save yourself some money! When I purchased this book, I was hoping to read a novel but was disappointed to find that it is nothing short of a really long poem dragged out in size 16 font over 60 pages of reading. Which I read in about 15-20 minutes. Although I found the story quite intriguing it was not what I'd hoped for; it lacked the type of stream of consciousness writing Marguerite Duras is known for which is autobiographical in nature and very real. The malady of death is a poem. So if you are looking for a novel to read, this is not it. I recommend, ""The Lover"" it is by far her best work."
2,Significantly Not as Described,"This item requires four coin cell batteries LR44, and not just one standard AAA battery."
3,ALLSOP 27193 DVD and CD Carbon Edge Pro,"The Allsop DVD cleaner is good BUT it is not for CD players as it is mistakenly listed. I bought this to clean my CD player for which it does not work. It is better than the Maxell DVD laser disc cleaner however it is meant only, I repeat, only for your DVD player."
2,disappointed,"This woman acts and thinks like a child. Understandably, her upbringing was not ""normal"" in the everyday sense, but being of Japanese ancestry, I was annoyed by her large ego and her cease-less bragging about herself."
3,Not quite what I was hoping for,"You get a lot of her life, that's for sure. But a little too much of I walked down the street, I petted the dog, I bought a ruler. Was hoping for more insight into the Japanese culture and how the Geisha, Geiko, Maiko culture developed. Plus, she blew the whole thing off and became a civilian. But, still readable and interesting."
1,"Intriguing subjet, insipid and flat book","Take a subject that fascinates western people, focus on the meaningless and insignificant details of it, put aside all the psychological depth of the characters evolving in this mysterious society, here is the recipe of a gigantic waste.Geisha is poorly written, with cheap literary tricks at the end of each chapter, and a final feeling of not learning anything."
2,Painful,"After reading ""Memiors of a Geisha"" and loving every minute of it, I was very excited to read ""Geisha a Life"" to get more of the truth behind what it is like to be a Geisha. Well sadly, I was very dissapointed. It was a very easy read but so boring that it ccould not hold my attention. I actaully read a few books inbetween. As far as writing styles goes, it felt like it was written by a child. Although she was an adult at the time of writing this book ,it still seems to be told through thte eyes of a 5 year old. All in all , I would not recomend this book to anyone. If you are under the age of 12 you may enjoy it. i think I will take the fictious verion over this one any day!"
1,Lacking and skewed,"To be honest, I was expecting more of this book. When I first picked it up at the library, it was out of curiosity (as I noticed that it had been connected to both Arthur Golden's fictional book as well as Liza Dalby's book).Overall...this book is dry and quite, quite horrible. The story telling is lacking, Mineko's portrayal of herself is bad and unbelievable, and she refutes certain things that several other authors, who researched more than one geisha life, had cited as true. It all but admits to exaggeration, bias, and inaccuracy.Then again, it is a biography, and nobody should expect it to be as accurate throughout as researched, historical material."
1,READ ME URGENTLY,"I ordered this book, but I did not notice that the shipping and handeling was $35.99. I sent them a cancellation e-mail BEFORE it shipped (about 2 days before it shipped) hoping that they would cancel it. So two days passed, and they finally replied WHEN IT SHIPPED indicating that it could not be cancelled due to the fact that it shipped, it's like they wated until it shipped to reply to me. Expecting the letters on the pages to be gold, due to how expensive the book was, I was dissapointed to observe the front cover RIPPED. Bad service, bad product, it's a shame I can't give you 0 stars in review."
4,geisha,"This book was not as fluent as ""memoirs of a geisha""...but I enjoyed it very much. The 1st hand experience of someone that had lived the Geisha life style. I really appreciateded it. I would read it again!"
4,Much information of an old Japanese tradition,"When I bought the book I wanted to learn more of the Geisha tradition and by that of Japanese culture in general.I never had believed that such a restricted life is still possible today. Mineko Iwasaki was taken away from her family when she was a small child. With much discipline she learnt traditional dancing, singing, playing instruments and roles in theatre, always being observed by elderly ladies, who wanted to educate her, eg by humiliation via wrong accusations. The meaning of such is explained clearly, as all the other details of the life of a geisha.A very interesting recommendatory book."
2,Over-Rated,"Although an interesting read, the autobiography lacks any real flow. The author jumps so often from one time period or story to another that you always wonder where you are in the time line.Also the author seems in such a rush to put down any suggestion of sexual undertones in the society, that it becomes over done. On the other hand she admits to an affair with a married man as normal.All through the author uses a snobbish tone and that is rather off putting. Also I think that claiming to remember in perfact clairity events from the age of two and three a bit crazy.I would not recommend this book."
2,Obnoxious,"In the beginning, this book appeared promising. I had never understood the geisha concept and was eager to find out more. Even after reading the entire book, I'm not sure that I am any further enlightened. Also, Mineko, the geisha, was and is shallow and selfish and self-aggrandizing. Her ""character"" (in a book that is touted as non-fiction) rang quite false. I had the sense that the story was crafted by a poor fiction writer. I rated the book 2 stars (instead of one) because I was able to tolerate it until the end, but my advise to you is DON'T BOTHER!"
5,Review,"I really enjoyed this book. I first read Memoirs of a Geisha, which I loved. I knew that Memoirs of a Geisha is a work of fiction and that Geisha, a Life would probably be a bit different. Trying not to see it in the context of an American woman, I just let go and followed along with Mineko's story. If we compare it to reference our culture to their's, there will be things that we consider strange, but in that culture are totally acceptable.Memoirs of a Geisha got me curious about the mysterious lives of geisha, and I really enjoyed reading this book as well. I now plan to read more about these mysterious women, who in the Western culture, have been portrayed as prostitutes, which they are most surely not."
3,O.D.: Original Diva?,"Having tread the common fiction Memoirs of a Geisha to Liza Dalby's quasi-ethnography Geisha, I had hoped to find a happy medium in this book: something that provides an accurate and deep exploration of contemporary geisha (for that time period) through the eyes of one artist with a bit of narrative. Geisha, a Life delivers this, but the author is very obviously reconstructing and justifying her past choices. Whereas an excellent memoir reflects on and admits poor decisions in addition to celebrating triumphs, this reads as a rather cleaned up and ego-boosting narrative. While no doubt she worked very, very hard to stay at the top of her profession and become a truly accomplished artist, her lack of comfort with the follies of the past reduce her to two dimensions. It's still interesting and informative, but the Iwasaki does herself no favors in trying to self-aggrandize; it's utterly transparent and a bit off-putting."
3,"Geisha, A Life","I picked up this book after rereading ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and wondering how realistic it was. This book, ""Geisha, A Life"" is written by Mineko Iwasaki, a world-renowned Japanese Geisha during the 60's and 70's. Born into a privileged family, she chooses to train in Kyoto's Gion Kobu district. Favored from the beginning, she was groomed to be the heir of her Geisha house. She worked obsessively to perfect her dancing skills and maintain her status as the foremost Geisha of Kyoto.The book is written with a certain detachment that prevents the reader from becoming fully engaged in Mineko's story. Perhaps because of Japanese culture and the taboo about Geisha revealing their secrets, the book comes off as dry and less than genuine."
3,Hard to Believe,"I found this book hard to believe. She remembers everthing when she was 3 yrs. old? Give me a break! She sounds like she's stuck on herself and acts holier than thou. At 18 she still thought kissing could get you pregnant?? I made it through this book but found it hard to digest with a straight face. A hundred grand a night for dancing for some guys? I dont think so. Next time, try being honest Mineko, you might have sold some more books! Or if your going to skimp on the truth, make it somewhat believable!"
1,Spare yourself!,Ugh! This book is only worthwhile if you worship Ms. Iwasaki as much as she does. The woman is so taken with herself that she becomes angered when Prince Charles dares to deface (her word) her fan with his autograph.Much of her portrayal of daily life seems hardly believable in its fairy tale like contrasts between the good Ms. Iwasaki and the evil geiko who apparently couldn't tolerate her perfection.
3,Interesting in and of itself,"Without comparing this book to to other writers, other similar pieces on gesha or geiko, I found this book interesting in and of itself.It flowed along in an easy, near rambliing sort of writing style that took me a bit to get used to, but the images of Japan and 'Geiko' life were interesting. Especially the little tidbits of information about personal life. Perhaps not the best book I ever read, but I did enjoy the read."
4,Worth a read if you care about facts and the truth,"The only reason I'm here reviewing this book is because Rande Brown is a relative of mine. That's how I know about the book in the first place. However, I promise my review will not be biased.Let me start by saying that this is not as ""interesting"" a read as ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", but that is a consequence of the truth being told. Nothing was made up here to make the story more interesting, but if you're interested in knowledge and facts as much as drama, you'll enjoy reading the book. As fascinating as Golden's interpretation of a geisha was, the real truth about what a geisha is is just as enthralling. If you read and enjoyed ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", then this is a must-read. Enjoy that book for being what it was- historical fiction. This is simply a biography, but a very good one. Not captivating in any way but truly fascinating."
2,Where is the magic...,"I read Memoirs of a Geisha like so many reviewers here and wanted to know more about Geihsa. This book feels more like a history book, the narration is dry and choppy no much feeling into it. The story of a little spoiled girl who was able to make her own decision when she was 5 years old. Not my favorite book."
2,No. no No no NO,"Boring is the word to describe this book. After reading Arthur Golden's Memoir of a Geisha, this book does not even begin to compare with it. Its told in a droll dry monotonous tone that's perfect if you suffer from insomnia and wish for a book to put you to sleep. Unless you relish reading your history textbook again leave this book on the shelf."
1,2 out of 3 aint bad???,"the book came in a timely fashion, price was wonderful. only issue i had with it was that it was supposed to be in good used condition and the entire book has come loose from the spine. i could understand a little loose, but that was an unacceptable surprise."
1,boring...,"I rather read ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" twice. I have read ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and loved it. So I picked up this book trying to find out more about Geisha life. And now, I don't want to find out more since a real Geisha life is boring enough..."
3,GEISHA 'mysticism',"This book as well as many others did nothing more than reaffirm the fact that 'geisha' is the Japanese equivalent to 'prostitute'.Sure, they are 'trained' in 'art' and 'dance' etc, but all in all are the equivalent of the western world's 'high end' hookers. Nothing more. Sorry to disturb anyone's fairytale. A [***] is, in the end, a [***]."
5,A good Return to Forver primer,"Like its liner notes say, this CD captures both the early period of Return to Forever, when the outfit was more of a jazz/Brazillian/Fusion group, and its later period, when the more Latin influences were de-emphasized in favor of rock. One can hear a clear difference between the two eras - whereas the earlier group was more introspective, the later one was much more energetic. The one constant, however, is the superior muscianship evident regardless of the material played."
3,"Decent table, works very well","Pros:- The table works very well- The size it folds down to is great- Easy to carry so it can be used at a picnic or as an easily storable extra table at home.Cons:- The stain quality didn't look the greatest- There were a few small chips on the side of my table when it arrived(Of course this is real wood and will probably get scratches and chips anyway, so oh well)"
1,Major shipping problems,"Beware of shipping problems with this product. We ordered the shoes for our daughter, who was headed off to sleep-away camp with sore feet and needed them to manage the camp activities. We were promised they would arrive that Friday (paying extra for that). The shoes didn't show up. The seller said they had been unable to contact the warehouse during the week, but promised that for an extra $20 we would get them ""for sure"" on that Saturday, the day before she was to leave for camp. The seller was polite and curteous on the phone, but still the shoes didn't arrive. The seller was also unable to give us a tracking number for the package and couldn't reach the warehouse and thus couldn't even tell us for sure that the shoes had been shipped. Now it's late Saturday, the shoes are not here, our daughter will have no protection for her feet while at camp, and we are out $50 in shipping costs."
1,why is this flick listed in the 'gay and lesbian' genre??????,"another flick that has little or nothing to do with gays or lesbians is on the ""gay and lesbian"" genre listing; what is wrong with you guys???? get your act together, please; pay more attention."
1,Not a great fit with all bikes -- particularly VTX1300C,"I bought this to lock the front disk and to serve as a visual deterrent. It won't fit on the front, and barely fits on the back disk, but in an inconvenient place where you hand can get burned by exhaust pipes. It's well built, it just isn't recommended for a VTX1300."
1,Obvious decrease in pet's mobility after taking Joint Max,"We used to take Glyco Flex stage II for our Golden Retriever, who was diagnosed with hip dysplasia a year ago. The vet suggested Glyco Flex and it worked well. When I called the provider through Amazon to inquire about the difference between soft chews and regular tablets, I was talked into getting Joint Max as that was supposed to be better and cheaper. Turns out neither is true. The dose for Joint Max is triple the dose of Glyco Flex, and I truly question it's quality. My dog's ability to move around has truly decreased, and I have not changed anything else in her daily routine. Same food, same amount of exercise, etc.. When I contacted the provider to get a refund they okay'd it without any questions. I would not recommend this product and will go back to Glyco Flex."
5,Best product ever,"My 8 year old mixed golden retriever started developing fairly serious arthritis. After a short walk around our neighborhood he would suffer significant pain and had major problems getting through the winter. He is now 12 years old and has been taking this product for 4 years and it's like he is aging backwards. He is so playful, runs up the stairs and can handle two times around the neighborhood with no problems. I can't say enough about this product. The price is great compared to other alternatives from the vet - be aware though the benefits appear slowly over time so don't give up. If you love your dog buy this product. You'll be so happy you did."
5,Always,I can't get this item anywhere else but on line. This Item is impossible to get anywhere else.So I will order again
3,Good Filter and Lens but no Cap,"I bought this product and the lens is good but I don't understand how it doesn't come with a cap because when you have it on the camera you can not protect it from scratches, then I tried to buy a cap separate and sony doesn't make any for a 37mm lens, that is ilogical. The kit is called Filter and Protector, but it doesn't protect itself, so you have to be replacing the lens very often"
2,Was required for a class,I didn't much care for this book. I don't think it's presented very well. The book seemed to be more about Unix rather than how to really work with Unix.
2,Not always what they seem,"I was disappointed by the book. I didn't get what I expected. The stories weren't bad, but how the book was organized was confusing. All the subheadings were ""when you want it and she doesn't"" ""when she wants it and you don't"". Please people get more creative. Like I said for five bucks the stories were worth it, but I would recommend completely skipping the table of contents."
5,Must Have,"Regardless of your art, you will want to have this book in your library. Once you start reading it is hard to put down. Series of ancient ways articles placed in one place by Furuya. Helps you understand what it is to practice an ancient martial art in a modern society. A book you will read over and over again."
1,Stay away,"I am surprised by all pevious happy customers giving away 5 stars for Mr. Furuya's brain child. Apart for numerous historic anecdotes, the prevailing theme of Mr. Furuya's writings is how good students were 300 years ago in Zen monasteries and how stinking bad his own students are. Aparently his dojo is filled with lazy people who are not too well versed in Zen lore and norms of behaviour expected from monastery acolyte. So, Mr. Furuya loses no time complaining about their insolent behaviour and their total failure to live up to his expectations.Also, keep in mind that this book is essentially the compilations of articles that appeared in different magazines at different times, but since Mr. Furuya's mood has not improved, expect the repetition of the same stories and the same complains."
2,Kodo Ancient Ways ?,"I am sorry but this is one load of contrived baloney.No, its not 300 years ago and if Mr. Furuya was in search of the way, it cant be found writing books about yourself. This is modern society and when you stoop to accept money from a student, then you are in business. When you spend your time buying and selling stuff on Ebay you lose your credibility of a lone monk, practicing martial arts in search of some lost meaning.I refuse to listen to someone who takes money and then complains that he is treated like a shopkeeper.I also refuse to believe most ordained shinto priests spend their time on Ebay ? I was curious and I bought the book....I would suggest all those who find real meaning in this excercise of ""look at me"", take a deep breath and a step back....and realize how much pap this actually is."
4,B-movie mayhem,"This collection is the ultimate for the genre of WW2 Nazi sexual escapades in a prison camp. The stories are as expected, very linear and no surprises, you see a lot of naked prisoners being beaten etc. The quality of the video and audio is somewhat lacking but that is probably because of the original material."
2,Sadistic,"If U are a heavy sadistic person as i am, DON'T even brouther buying this.The cover is not what the movie is.U can find heavier snuff on line."
4,GREAT ALBUM...BUT CD VERSION IS CUT! ONE SONG MISSING!,"GOOD EP BY LEGENDARY GERMANY TRASH LORDS! BUT THE LP AND CASSETTE VERSION OF OUT OF THE DARK INCLUDE A SONG CALL ""GANGLANDS""! WICH IS GREAT...PROBABLY THE BEST OF THE ALBUM. THE SONG IS KINDA OD A JUDAS PRIEST TRIBUTE AND IS INCREDIBLE! TO BAD THE CD VERSION DOES NOT INCLUDE IT!"
5,The early sixties classics,"Neil was a prolific songwriter who had many hits via other people's recordings, beginning with Stupid Cupid (Connie Francis). He also had his share of hits with his own recordings. These came in two distinct phases - the early sixties and the mid-seventies. This compilation focuses on his early sixties music.Neil was hugely successful on both sides of the Atlantic in the early sixties. In America, thirteen of his singles made the top forty, with many of them going much higher. In the UK, he never made it to number one but nevertheless had seven top ten hits and four minor hits, the top ten hits being I go ape, Oh Carol, Stairway to heaven, Calendar girl, Little devil, Happy birthday sweet sixteen and Breaking up is hard to do (which was a number one hit in America).This collection contains all the essential tracks from Neil's music of the early sixties."
3,Lexus: The Relentless Pursuit,The book was an interesting background to the development of the first Lexus and the Japanese 'way' but needed some sharper editing.
3,"Good, not great.","While an amazing task to create a new car make from the ground up, it was a stark contrast to see how close it came to not happening at all. A chief Engineer who sounds like a slavedriver, USA based staff being shot down at every turn.Only downside to the book is that i found it put a gloss of perfection on the make, though even the author had to note the struggles once MB and BMW caught back up in terms of price and technology. Lexus makes one heck of a fine product, but they didn't go an invent a flying car or anything."
1,BEWARE!!!,"As soon as you put it in your cd tray the following pops up: ""To listen to this cd a number of files need to be updated on your PC. Select OK to install, cancel to quit the installation process"" DO NOT BUY unless you want the cd to install software on your computer that you have no idea where it has been. I won't play it on my computer and will return it. While it plays on my CD player I can't dump it to my hard drive media player. Other reviews (elsewhere) indicate that it won't play on all CD players."
4,Gershwin and Astaire,"Gershwin and Astaire. What's not to like about that? If you've seen the movie, then you'll appreciate this soundtrack more. Is it the best ST ever? No, but far from the worst. Like the movie, good, not great. Just to hear Fred Astaire is always a treat. Astaire was always the composer's favorite. He was described as signing the songs the way the composer wanted them sung. Audrey Hepburn does her own singing and it seems to be an effort for her, but she somehow manages. For me this ST, like the movie, doesn't quite measure up. Sound quality is so, so. Still, Gershwin, Astaire. Well, it gets a four from me just for that."
4,"Good, but rubber feet could be better","I purchased this after I had the roofing company repair my gutters. The workers had this stabilizer on the ladders and rested them on the roof. This enabled a large angle as to avoid the landscaping in the front of my house.In using them, I realized that in that position (which is probably not the intended use) the feet tend to slip off. As another reviewer mentioned I am going to try to glue mine although the feet are a wearing item and are sold separately.All in all this was a good purchase."
2,Prefer the U-bolt type (smaller and lighter),"The two disadvantages are (1) it's heavier than the traditional U-bolt type and (2) it takes two rungs instead of only one, forcing the ladder to be longer when fully compressed. So when you're trying to place the ladder upright, it's top heavy and longer.For my heavy Type I 32 foot extension ladder, I cannot handle it alone with this quick-click stabilizer. I got the U-bolt type instead. That works better for me, and it costs less money."
1,NOT SAFE AS ADVERTISED,"Werner AC78 Quickclick StabilizerThis product was delivered promptly and in good condition. When I opened the outer cartoon and started reading the instructions, the first thing I saw was this is to be used on Werner Ladders only and be used on top step only. My plan was to put it on the roof in order to clean my gutters as advertised on Amazon. When I tried to do this the attachment touched the gutter. I called Werner Co. and they told me that the Werner AC78 CANNOT be used on the roof. It has no OSHA and ANSI certification like the other stand off. I will return this and order the other one before someone borrows it and kills them selves. This product may be good on a wall but due to space limitations in my garage I will only keep one tool that works for everything I need it to do."
5,Fast and stable,"Easy to attach and remove, light, what more would you want from a standoff for an extension ladder?"
1,Easy to go on & Easy to fall off too!,"I bought this product several years ago from Sears and was using it on a 32-ft 2-piece fiberglass ladder that I had also installed the Werner leveler to it. As I was struggling with the monster that I had created, the Quick Click Stabilizer fell off from high up on me and deeply cut my arm. I still have the scar after maybe 4 or 5 years. I am lucky that it did not hit me in the head. Again the idea is good but don't over do it like I did. Use it on shorter ladders that you can handle easily and be careful, wear hard hat."
1,Quickclick Stabilizer - can be dangerous,"The quickclick stabilizer is not as handy as one would think. Yes, it is easy to take off and put on, but when you have a variety of extension ladder heights that you are adjusting your ladder to, it is easy to forget that the quickclick stabilizer limits the ability of the extension ladder to be placed at its shortest length. If you are not careful, when the extension ladder is placed at its quickclick impaired shortest length the quickclick stabilizer safety pin is what the ladder is supported on. If the pin should break (and it is a only a 1/8th inch diameter pin), the ladder will drop down to its true shortest length and the quickclick stabilizer will come off."
1,Where's the savings,This ad claims you will save 58.00 but when you look it up at most hardware stores like lowes for instance they are only 42.00 there so where are they sold for 100.00 at?
3,Great Idea - falls short,"This is a great idea, the three pieces assemble quickly, it's very easy to attach to and remove from ladders, but one aspect makes the whole item a total waste of money: the rubber tips at the ends of the curved pieces - what actually rests against the house - slide over the aluminum, are not really attached to the item and easily fall off when moving it, making it do damage to the building with the sharp edges of aluminum. If they were inserted into the hollow aluminum with a cotter pin or something to hold them in, it would be a wonderful product. I'm not saying don't buy it, just if you do, also buy some ring clamps to hold the rubber pieces on. Great idea that falls short on essentials."
3,Great accessory but not to be used on roofs,"I received the product and had it installed on my ladder in minutes. The quickclick is a wonderful design and the construction is light and sturdy. The amazon write-up mentioned that the ladder could be placed on the roof itself. Well, this did not work for me. The attachment goes on the top two rungs of the ladder and the supports are basically perpendicular to the ladder. This is great for a wall but not too good for roofs. I have a steep roof (5/12) but still I couldn't get the angle to land the rubber supports on the roof. The gutter kept getting on the way. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that the attachment has a bulky and sharp support on the second rung which can easily damage your gutter if you are not careful. Good product but I wish the attachment could be angled to be placed on the roof."
1,Company Says Can't Be Used on a Roof,"The Amazon review advertises that the feet of the stabilizer can be placed on the roof. However, when I tried to do exactly that, the stabilizer was tilted at the wrong angle. I called the Werner company this morning, thinking that I was doing something wrong. I was told by the technical service representative that the stabilizer was not meant to be placed on a rooftop! Who the heck wrote the product description?This may be a good product--I wouldn't know, because I cannot use it for the application for which I bought it--and for which it was advertised."
4,"As an Advertising student, a fantastic source of information","Rapid Response Advertising is a great source of information and an 'inside look' on how the professionals work in the Advertising industry. It is a bible for students,those in the industry and any small business that can use these techniques and strategies to create the most efficient and effective forms of advertising."
1,1 issue killed this beauty,"The wallet itself is nice, comes in an awesome leather boxProblem is, and for me it KILLS it: neither licenses or credit cards can fit in any of the pockets. they are simply 3mm too tight...too bad1 star outta 5 cause this could have been avoided...."
1,Unusable.,"This was a complete waste of my money. I could not insert drivers license, credit cards, or other plastics. This item should have a negative star. Unfortunately Amazon reviews need at least one star to submit. If you already ordered, cancel immediately. Don't make the same mistake as me and let it set around for over a month before trying to transfer your cards."
2,the Wallet is very small,"The wallet is very small, I feel something sad and deceived,I imagined that tapeworm measured normal, seems a wallet for children"
3,Tommy Wallet,"I bought this wallet for my boyfriend and it was a lot smaller in size than I thought it was. Frankly the case was a lot nicer than the wallet. I was planning to return but never got around to it. Its an okay wallet, its not great"
4,not bad,"i got this for my husband, but asked him to keep it as gift and not to use seeing his old wallet,he carries like 15 credit cards plus his driver's lic' and business cards etc, so thought this slim wallet wont be enuf to fit everything, but the brand is good and the wallet case was too good, a leather box, it looks the same as it is in the picture'"
2,very small,This portfolio is for childI do not recommendesta cartera esta muy chiquita parece para nino antes de comprarla debi toamar la medida primerono la recomiendo
1,Way to Slim !!,"This wallet's card slots are too small to easily fit any Credit Cards, Drivers License, Insurance Cards, etc. The see through slot is useless for any ID card. Although, it is high quality."
1,panasonic Lumix camera does not fit in this case,You have this camera case listed under accessories for the Panasonic DMC FA20PP Lumix Camera. The camera does not come close to fitting in this case. The camera is 1 1/2 inches wider than the case.
3,Smaller Than It Looks,"I have mixed feeling on this photo-backback. It's not bad but it is small......smaller than it looks in the photos. I'm barely able to squeeze my Canon Digital Rebel (300D) + 300/4 IS + 1.4X teleconverter. Length-wise it is a VERY tight fit. Of course that combination is 13"" long. There is room left width-wise for one more body and a small lens or flash.The dividers act as padding but the built-in padding of the pack is minimal. The zippers look a bit flimsy too but no problems yet. There are a couple of other exterior pockets, (one on the straps for a cell phone) that might be handy. I would not pay anymore than $12 or so + shipping from an alternate Amazon seller for this pack."
1,misleading information!,"targus says it is compatible with nikon coolpix 5700, but it is not - case much smaller than the camera"
5,great for a small person,I love this backpack for my camera. I'm small at 5'0''. Most other camera backpacks are too big for me. This one fits like a glove.
1,Too Small,Sony DSC-F717 does NOT fit. Cannot comment on the other aspects of this item as it is going back to Amazon ASAP.
5,Waddle We DO !!!,"I can't get that dog-gone ending song out of my head! It's like a theme straight outta some Disney flick. If you think political satire is funny, if you think silly is funny, if you think penguins are cute,. . . . heck, if you just ""think""; get An Inconvenient Penguin. Another Precipice productions gem! And, I'm just saying that."
5,A Classic!,"This movie short is filled with charm, wit, and lots of funny moments that you won't forget. I highly suggest everyone to watch this :-)!"
4,Waddle we do now?,"Until I got this movie, I didn't realize that there was a growing epidemic with penguins. I suddenly became frightened at what might happened to my friends and family, and hatched an escape plan in case the epidemic spread.Joking aside, this is pretty good fun if you liked March of the Penguins or an Inconvenient Truth. The acting is laughable both ways (It borders on hilarious and so bad it's good), and the whole presentation is a cool mockery (If you notice, the people in the presentation room are also the extras that are getting interviewed).If there is one thing that is keeping the movie from being perfect is that it still holds a level of budget production values, which is appropriate but still detrimental to the viewing experience. Some of the transitions seriously looked like they were created on Windows Movie Maker.For three bucks, you can't go wrong for a few laughs, and the ending song ""Waddle we do"" will be in your head for at least a week."
1,Sucks,"(Unable to play file, please try again later.If you continue to experience this problem, contact Amazon customer support and reference the following error code: [0xC00D002F].)But of course that doesn't ring any bells in amazon help.Just want to watch a movie."
2,Great Record!! CD Could HAve Been Brilliant!!!!!!!,"First of all I am glad they released the European version of this record along w/ the original artwork. And they got rid of Is There Smething I should Know, which should have been on 7 and the Ragged Tiger. W/ that said, I bought this version as a Dutch import in '81 along w/ all the singles and a Japanese Ep containg rare b-sides called Night Romantics.....I am stunned the label did not take advantage of cd technology and not include: Planet Earth and Girls On Films (NIGHT VERSIONS) and Fame, Khanada, Late Bar, Faster than Light, Like an Angel and My Own Way(original)these should have been included to fill out the cd and document D2's early work as a whole......a real shame but I have the vinyl which sounds better anyways......This cd is better than nothing and the inclusion of To the Shore is a great move.....like I said it is a great record but the cd could have been incredible!!!"
5,Best of the Bunch!,"All I can say is,this is their best album.Simple to the point.I like and have most of their albums,but for me,their first is their best.Mix pop,funk,disco,beats,new romantics,shake it up,there you go!Too bad they didn't stay somewhat towards that,(Power Station anyone)?"
5,Finally - TO THE SHORE,"I was SO excited when I found out that Duran Duran was going to release the original recording of their first (and fantastic) album. When Duran Duran re-released this album in 1983, To the Shore was replaced by Is There Something I Should Know? (also known as ITSISK?) Although I loved ITSISK?, I was heart-broken to find that To the Shore didn't make it onto the re-release. To the Shore is haunting and beautiful and sexy and magical. It contains the word Sanhedralyte - when I asked Simon what it meant, he told me ""Nothing. I made it up"". Whether or not that is true, I don't care. To the Shore is my favorite Duran Duran song, and I am glad to see it back where it belongs."
2,simplistic story line with poorly developed characters,Give this boring and predictable novel a miss. Poorly developed characters posess no depth to make me care for them. Self-absorbed boomers ruminating in their past still finding no meaning. Are we surprised?
5,This book clearly represents a work of fine literature.,This was a really great book and whoever gave it a poor review obviously does not appreciate modern writing. I loved it! Yeah for Ann Hood. Thank you for reading this review.
4,Wise and Keen Prose Lend to this poignant novel,"Spare style and quick, witty dialog all make Somewhere Off The Coast Of Maine a refreshing read. Three womens' lives have become intertwined through family and fate. Long gone are the sixties of their rebellious youth, but they still keep their memories close to their hearts as a loved one keeps a snippet of hair in a locket. We learn the values of these memorable characters through their children; family plays an important role in this novel. Sad at times, funny at other times, the novel is one to breeze through quickly and effortlessly, yet the reader is still left with a sense that they have read a classic novel of the human condition. I highly recommend this novel as a change of pace for anyone bogged down by heavy books, or not able to get ""INTO"" a new book. An excellent choice of reading material."
3,Entertaining,"Though not deep literture by any stretch of the imagination, this book made me fall in love with Ann Hood. The themes explored here (the sixties, lost idealism, familial relations, the complexity of romantic relations) are frequent themes in her novels. so much so, that they become fairly redundant after awhile. this, however, is her best outing. Rather than probing deeply into the pysches of her characters, Hood instead takes the reader on an entertaining skim of thier surafaces, which are interesting enough to make the read a pleasant one. this book is kind of like a well made tv movie: insubstantial but entertaining, impossible to turn away from once you're hooked. an earlier reviewer compared the style to those of Ann Tyler or Alice Hoffman. I think thats an accurate comparison, although Hood may even be a little more accesible due to the fact that the novel is zippier and less bogged down in ulitmately irrevelent detail."
2,Underdeveloped characters and unexciting storylines,"This book could have been great had the characters been better developed and their motivations better explained. Up to the last line, I kept waiting for something to happen, and felt ""taken"" at the end. The storyline was barely held together, and I did not like the women at all, even the ones I was supposed to sympathize with - Skip it!"
4,"Good, quick & easy read","I enjoy reading Ms. Hood's work while I am traveling or just want a diversion from everyday life. She develops her characters in a manner that makes them easy to relate. This particular work brought me back to an earlier time in my own life, which was fun to revisit. Not too deep, but enjoyable reading. wish the book would have lasted longer."
4,One of the better one in this series,"As someone who is spending a good deal of time in Essex County these days, and as someone who enjoys history, I bought a bunch of these photojournals of the towns in the county. Most of the other books are generally haphazard and confusing (see my reviews of Hanover, West Orange and Livingston). Also, those others seemed geared for the locals, not for a wide audience. This book on Millburn (a quaint little town) is the exception to the rule, so far. The photos are logically arranged, and the surrounding text is relevant to what is depicted. That is something I can't say for the others. I've enjoyed this one, and I hope that the others I have picked up are equally impressive."
3,just ok,"Looks similar to original but lighter material also shorter overall length than original, though it appears fairly wellmade it does not fit a mans field watch or wrist as well as the original either. A 19mm band might be a moreaccurate fit."
4,Field Watch band,I used this on my LL Bean field watch. The 18mm replacement band fits perfectly and feels and looks good. The last replacement band I bought was from deBeer and was not to my liking.The leather on the deBeer band was very thick and troublesome when putting band on and taking off. Sometimes less is better. I highly recommend this band over deBeer's similar band. I think the deBeer's was also a few dollars more than this band.
4,Good thriller,"Not a bad book. Good plot. Holds your attention. Easy reading. However, the book reflects the writter's background a little too much. All the characters are prone to self reflection and psychobabble. And for some reason, all the characters like to quote from ancient philosophers. The schools in LA must be better than I thought. That being said, I did enjoy the book and would recommend it others."
1,"Not the way to go, IMHO","I worked my way through parts I and II of this Oxford Latin before stumbling upon Henle's latin course. I did honestly enjoy the Oxford course, but it's certainly no way to really acquire lingua latinae-- at least not in any great depth. The Oxford course also focuses strictly on classical latin, without any reference to ecclesiastical latin-- a major, major drawback, IMO.I wasted over $40 on parts I and II of this Oxford course, good money for mere superficial pamphlets! If your goal is to really learn latin, go with the four volume Henle course (each volume is around 400 pages!-- 300% more pages and 30% cheaper than Oxford! ). There is also an additional _Latin Grammar_ volume that is to be used in conjunction with the four volumes. Henle is a Jesuit philosopher and latinist, and his presentation is solid. And unlike the Oxford course, you will learn both classical and ecclesiastical-- the latter being VERY important in academic research/scholarship."
3,"Ok, but difficult to understand without help","I have this book, and it helped me realize that I enjoy Latin. However, the grammar is not explained very well, and I find that I cannot learn a new chapter without guidance from a teacher. Since I live in an area without many Latin teachers, I had difficulty utilizing this book with independent study. However, with a teacher to explain the grammar, this book would be all right. Another problem is that the cartoons at the beginning of each chapter are poorly drawn. Even though this might seem trivial to some, it really does bother me. Personally, I would look for a better text, but this one is OK if you have a teacher."
5,The only way to learn Latin!,"This is one of the best courses for the self-taught Latin learner that I have ever found. Easy to follow, it uses the ""learn by doing"" method of reading and learning from context, rather than bogging the reader down in intimidating Latin grammar. Grammar is introduced based on readings, and is broken up into short lessons so that it isn't too much to absorb at once. Plus, there's a real sense of accomplishment from reading Roman myths and about the wanderings of Aeneas in Latin! I recommend this course!"
5,Excellent Textbook,"My son's Latin Teacher was delighted by this version of the Oxford Latin Course. As it turns out, the later version actually contains less content than this one."
3,School Text,"This is what I need to teach at a new school this fall. Frankly I am not that fond of the Oxford Latin Course, but the present curriculum utilizes this text. I don't quite understand why the authors put the grammatical explanations and exercises in the back of the book. The artwork is also rather amateurish, with the characters resembling cartoon figures rather than typical Romans. To colleagues I would be more inclined to recommend Ecce Romani Series or the Cambridge Latin Course. Curate ut valeatis!"
1,Poor set,"I am using this book for a correspondence Latin Class at a University. I think it is quite defecient. There are hardly any examples. In Chapter 3 I believe it introduces questions like ""How are you Argus?"" gives one example and expects that you will be able to figure the everything out your own. Maybe with a good teacher and this book simply as a supplement it would be decent. I am using BYKI and find it much more useful than this book."
2,Outdated Text,Take note: This is the 1988 text version and will be outdated for classroom use. I accidentally purchased it for my Latin class (my own fault for not checking really) and I hope I can keep others from making the same mistake.
2,Don't use this book for high school students.,"The layout of this book was horrible! The images could have been done a whole lot better as well. I enjoyed reading the stories about Quintus and such, but I felt this book could have gone deeper in explaining the grammar and history. Also, the lessons, which are short, are in the back of the book instead of with the chapter. I wish my teacher had Wheelock's lessons instead."
3,Choose Another Book!,"I have learned a half dozen languages and used many different books to do so...this one is by far the most irritating! The book does not give very clear explanations for the cases & grammar in Latin and I was halfway through chapter 5 when I realized that the majority of my questions could be answered at the back of the book, where all the grammar excersises are. This book isn't terrible, just confusing. It has strangely drawn cartoons (like Sunday comic strips) to help you understand the dialogue, and some excellent history stories about what life was probably like in ancient Rome. If you really want to learn Latin, though, I am told that Wheelock's is a much better book. I recommend taking a chance with that book instead of this one."
4,A dead language becomes alive in images and conversation .,Fun. Challenging. Practical. Effective course. You become involved instantly. From the very begging it involves your attention and soon you are reading and understanding. Inexorably it leads you to want to check out part 2.
4,Good text book for Latin starters,It looks easier than its old version. Better organisation of content. Good to have it for Latin learning with English. It can be used by learners have English as second language.
4,Smallish but functional,"Just got this bag to go with a folding bike. Was surprised how small it was even though the description said medium. Regardless, I love the way it does hold all of my, ""Better take it along bike stuff, just in case."" Have a small pump, patch kit, hand wipes, a small first-aid bag and tool kit so far and still have room. I would not suggest you keep your ID in the bag if you put your keys in it. If the bag is stolen or falls off, someone can find out where you live. A woman I know carries a small canister of pepper spray in her bag. She said nothing else works on dogs who run loose and love to go after persons on bikes. If you want, this bag has room for that. Overall, a well made product.I gave it four stars for now only because it is cold and damp here right now. The bag does not mind being damp but the cold makes it a little stiff, just like me, apparently! I will update this review later."
4,Nice bag,"I have a couple of other bags from Topeak and they all appear to be very durable. This one is just the right size for a tube, multi-tool and my keys. There is still a little room for a phone if your phone is small enough. Mine isn't. My only complaint is when you have the bag cinched on nice and tight the zipper has a hard time getting past the seat. Otherwise, nearly perfect!"
2,Nice While It Lasted....,"Nicely designed bag on the whole. See other reviews here for features and such. Big enough for riding local and handling the essentials.Would have been nice if it had a pocket inside that would fit a smart phone - my HTC is too tall to fit the mesh one on the rear flap which meant it got stuck in there with my garage door opener and folding tool set, bouncing along for the ride.Biggest negative is that the zipper for the rear flap only last 13 months - 2 zips per ride, 4 rides a week, or somewhere around 500 uses. First the zipper pull came off at 6mos then the rest of zipper body at the end. Not good.Bought a different brand as a replacement, hoping it will last longer."
2,Nice fit and space but bad quality,"I have had this for about 8 months on my MTB. I ride through city but have not even done maybe 300 miles in the past 8 months since I've been busy and the bag has ripped in a couple of key places. The belt that runs through the seat and holds it tight has almost completely ripped at the stitches. Also, on the side it is ripping at the stitch. Good bag and seems like good quality but they need to do better sawing job and it would be good. Now I need a new bag and this one is garbage."
5,Great Product,"Arrived on time & well packaged. Secures well to my seat post. Smaller than I thought, but did manage to hold everything I needed. Great quality, also has a clip for your tail light installation. Very happy with this purchase."
5,Perfect Size,"This thing is light, just like most topeak products. Where it really shines is it's size. It's the perfect size for all of your tube repair stuff, and a wallet and cell phone. You can fit even a little more if you try. The medium size is where it's at."
4,Nice Pack,"This is a good sized pack with lots of room, but not too big. I fit a thorn-proof tube, some tools, an inflator, and two CO2 cartridges in it and there's still room for car keys and a wallet. And that's without unzipping the expansion seam.It's a nice looking pack and it fits nicely under the seat. The zipper is a little tough to unzip under the seat, but that's not that big of a deal."
4,does the job,"This pack accomplishes what I needed it to do. It holds my wallet, smart phone, keys, and granola bar. Could not ask for more!"
4,Good pack,"After reviewing other's feedback, I decided that this could be at least an ok product. (Kudo's all the people who left detailed reviews)It was very easy to install, and I can easily fit my wallet, blackberry, key and garage opener (not he big bulky one, but one that is sized like a alarm for a car) without extending the bag. Only thing I would complain is that the zipper could be a double-sided zipper. All in all, it worked great as other people indicated."
3,Not bad,It holds a fair amount of gear and all my repair things fit well. Though when I hung a tail light on the hook the whole thing pulled off on my first ride. It was either glued or lightly stitched on the bag and poorly so at that.
3,topeak aero wedge,"Should have bought the large wedge, the medium has room for the essentials and that s it. i can fit a tube ,tire levers,mini tool inflater and a couple cartridges and a energy bar. no room for the camera or anything else, thats with the wedge expanded.The zipper is stressed with those items packed. i do like the buckle attachment and would buy another............ only larger"
4,A good Bag,This bag is of pretty high quality and is well thought through. Its not a great bag though if you have a pretty chunky wallet. This bag is more of a cone shape than a square and I usually have to take everything out to get to my wallet. I think the hatch style door is a little tougher than the models which have a zipper which unzips the wall itself of the bag.
2,the plastic buckle broke when I attached it,the plastic buckles are low quality. one broke when I tried to attach the bag (I wasn't pulling hard!). I had to secure the bag with additional wires.the bag itself is fine.
4,Nice little pack...,"Pack is very nice, sturdy construction. Durable material. My only complaint is that the zipper is hard to bring over the top when unzipping and then back over to zip up as it is tight against the underside of my seat. Would recommend to a friend."
3,Good little wedge pack,"This wedge pack is a nice small addition to a bike. The positives are the water proof zippers (the contents in the bag stay nice and dry, even during the torrential rainstorms that we can get here in the southeast). The buckles to hook the pack to the saddle are very good. They fit nice and snug, and keep the bag from swaying like some of my others have.The one downside is that even with the ability for a little bit of expansion, it is a pretty small pack. It holds two tubes, a CO2 cartridge and adapter and tire tools. It would be nice to have a slightly bigger pack, put being able to fit so nice and snugly under the seat, as well as its relatively low price, makes it a great little pack for long rides."
3,"Does the job, nothing fantastic though","This does the job. Should have ordered one that clamps more solid to the seat though. This one seems to stretch more then I expected. But, it does fit my bike and holds my essentials."
2,"Came open twice, cell phone fell out on the bike trail","Looks very nice and durable, and is easy to install. I used it once for about an hour on a rough trail ride with a friend and my cell phone fell out. I realized when my bike tools fell out and made enough noise on the dirt trail to hear. Found the zipper had come opened up. Strangest thing! Back-tracked and found the cell phone and rode out 1/2 mile and the zipper started coming open again! Possibly the design needs a velcro spot to secure the zipper shut. I bought a different design and have had no trouble on several rides."
3,Topeak Aero Wedge Pack,"This is a really nice unit, but the only draw back was how narrow it is. It's hard to fit everything in it, but overall it's a nice unit."
5,great product,"This fits perfectly under the seat of my Specialized Dolce. I can fit in it: a spare tube, multi tool, granola bar, tire lever, a few dollars, and my phone. It's solid and durable and I like that it has a reflector."
3,Smaller Than I thought,"I picked the medium based on all the reviews I read. It fits an inner-tube, t-wrench and tire levers. I can probably squeeze a phone in and some keys. There isn't much room left although and can unzip the mid zipper and get about an inch more. Construction is good and fit is a bit awkward as it doesn't fit the contour of the seat post and the seat bottom on my bike. I opted for the velcro model after all the bad reviews regarding the one with the ""fixer"". Overall I'm satisfied. I can't imagine buying the small model if you want to carry a tube and some wrenches."
4,Medium is Too Big,"Based on the reviews here, I ordered a medium. It fits my bike, but it's huge: a better product for a commuter bike than a road bike. I can easily fit two tubes, two co2 cartridges, a roll of tape, a pocket knife, cell phone, etc in the main compartment. The front flap has a mesh pocket that easily fits my multitool and could hold a lot more.The capacity is great, except it's so big it's a bit of an eyesore on my road bike. I'd recommend a smaller size with less capacity for serious riders."
1,Disappointed - Design flaw for durability,"I've been riding with this wedge for less than a year, with about 1,700 miles of use. I researched extensively and was willing to pay a few extra $ for a higher quality product. At first was very happy with the wedge and its size, quality, and feel. I was very disappointed when I noticed a seam coming apart after about 7 months. There is a thin plastic(?) insert in the bag keeping the wedge stiff from the opening along its top that aligns perfectly with the top seam by the opening. The swinging of the wedge that comes from normal riding and hill climbing will cause this stiff insert to rub against this seam breaking it down. Its just a matter of time. 7 months is not what I would consider acceptable product durability. This is my second bad experience with a Topeak product. There won't be any more opportunities for a third."
5,"Perfect size - big enough for all I need, but still compact","I'm very happy with this bag. I need to carry a spare tube, a few tools and my phone. It's big enough for all of this with room to spare. It's still really compact under the seat. I haven't used the zip out expansion, but it is nce to have in case I need to pack in more. Loops underneath are great for carrying my pump too.All in all, great construction and lots of room for storage."
4,Good looking and durable!,"Good looking, durable and easy to use. Fits well in my bike. I would recommend this product and amazon's impeccable shipping and quality standards."
3,Okay,"No top clip on this bag - so hence it only being ok. Size is good for a cellphone, keys, and a small tube of sunscreen. The bag I was trying to replace clipped on and off for greater portability. However this bag is well constructed and easy to install"
5,Perfect bag. Can't tell its there.,"I do mostly technical mountain terrain. With this bag I can keep my wallet, keys, phone and multi-tool: everything I need. Great price, durable bag. I love the expandable zipper."
5,Great Bag!,"this is a great saddle bag, it fits everything and as long as there is enough stuff in there it cant rattle (if you only put a multi-tool in it it will hop around) holds everything without expanding, multi-tool, leatherman, patch kit, pressure gauge, zip-ties, phone, wallet and an inner-tube if expand it. buckles are secure and easy to remove because there are two of them, one for each side. each independently adjustable so it wont swing."
4,suave design...,"This wedge pack looks great on my road bike. My cell phone, spare cash, replacement tube, and necessary tools fit great. The buckle attachment makes for easy removal, which will be necessary when expanding the bag for additional volume. This pack fit tight against the bottom of the seat. I owned a bike shop several years ago, and this wedge lives up to the excellent reputation that Topeak has earned!"
4,"Good Quality, Good Price","What you see is what you get. Provides enough room for your wallet, keys and cell phone OR a tire repair kit with spare tire."
1,"Worst buy, don't buy this!","I bought this for my mt. bike.It did not last more than 20 rides, the material got completely tore up, just from gravity.I spoke with a friend who bought the same product and experience a similar thing.If there was zero star I would have given it.Very bad product."
1,OMG!,"MY HUSBAND GOT ME THIS WATCH SINCE I HAVE MVP AND I LIKE TO EXERCISE AND I NEED TO KEEP MY HEART RATE IN CHECK. WHEN I RECEIVED IT THE WATCH DIDN'T WORK AT ALL SO I CHANGE THE BATTERIES FOR A PAIR THAT CAME WITH AND IT TURNED ON. THAT IS NOT THE END. IF IT WOULD WORK PROPERLY IT WOULD BE GREAT SINCE THE FEATURES ARE USEFULL. I AM GREAT AT FIGURING OUT THINGS BUT THIS WATCH WAS HARD TO SET UP EVEN FOR MY HUSBAND. EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT I GRAB IT AND PUT IT ON BEFORE MY WORKOUT THE WATCH FOR SOME REASON FREEZES UP ON ME AND NOTHING WORKS, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T EVEN BEEP. I HAVE TO OPEN IT UP BY TAKING ONE STRAP OFF AND THE TINY SCREWS, MOVE THE BATTERY, CLOSE IT CAREFULLY AND SET UP DATA AND TIME AGAIN. THIS IS MY DAILY ROUTINE BEFORE WORKING OUT....... TALK ABOUT WARMING UP AND GETTING YOUR HEART RATE UP BEFORE A WORKOUT FROM BEEN SO ANNOYED."
5,An awesome replica,"I have this sitting at work, it is very very nice! The quality is amazing. I really love these shelby models."
5,Great Car,This was a great purchase of a fine model. It was very well made and was undamaged when it was received. The Shelby addition was very well done. If it were larger it would be a real car!
3,Mmmm.....,"I bought this book, and well, I haven't exactly started reading it yet. I just have one question though, does Princeton Review have a book that's for the AP exam? Coz that's what I'm realli look for. Thx..ur help is appreciated~"
5,"Wow, I've found it!","I've been looking for this album for over 20 years now, I've looked all over the world for CD version."
2,Platinum is Bronzed,"Not my idea of choices for this GBA Video cartridge, to say the least. The only episode on that cartridge that was really neat was the ""Cowboy Courage"" episode. I could think of better episodes that are ""pure gold"" so to speak. But for now, I suggest you choose ""Cartoon Network: Special Edition,"" unless you really like those episodes on this game."
1,Problem with controls,"I bought this mattress pad through JCPenney catalog for a great price. However, once we set it up it didn't work. The control would blink one red light after about an hour and the pad automatically shut off.I called the company and they said they get frequent problems/calls from customers who live in ""rural"" areas, because supposedly the power may fluctuate slightly and cause the pad to shut off as a ""safety feature"". It was very disappointing and inconvenient to have to take the pad back to the store and order a different brand. Don't bother to buy a restwarmer, even a surge protector didn't resolve the issue."
3,I use as a preventive,I use Desitin at night right before I put my 1 yr twins to sleep. They just started to sleep through the night and sometimes they poop before I can change them in the morning. I use Desitin to try and prevent diaper rash. If you were to use it to cure the diaper rash I would use a different product. It seems to me that it takes forever for the diaper rash to go away if I just used Desitin.
5,Amazing Product,People are giving 1 star ratings because of shipping accidents and the amount of cream included in this buy?Those are ridiculous reasons to be giving an amazing working product a low rating. It's not the creams fault :PThis product is absolutely fantastic and my baby is always super happy to be creamed up to prevent nasty diaper rashes. I'd recommend it to anyone with a baby. It's a must have.
4,Does the job,"It's no instant cure-all, but when my 1 1/2 year old had an upset stomach which showed up in her diaper, and gave her the worst rash she has had to date, it helped soothe it right away and it was all but gone the next day."
5,It works well.,This product works well. I used it two times and my daughter's diaper rash was gone. I recommended this product to my friend too.
4,Works well to prevent but not treat diaper rash,"These cream works well to keep my baby's bottom from becoming red. However, when she developed a diaper rash due to diarrhea every two hours, it didn't help at all and I had to take my daughter to the pediatrician to get a better cream."
5,Magical,I love this cream and my baby's skin too. It works soo fast less than 12 hours and the rash disappeared. Very good size and smells good too. I used it for my 3 weeks old newborn girl.
3,Works Great,"This works great at relieving a diaper rash...however, I HATE creams, I'd much rather have and prefer an ointment...(that's why only 3 stars)"
1,Packaging not delivery proof,"It's the second time I order this product and in both cases the packaging did not resist the shipping process and arrived broken and spilling. Another important fact is that the cost to mail the product back to the seller is almost the same price of the product itself, in other words, it's not even worth returning. If you can buy this product in a store nearby, do not order it online.The cream itself is great, I'm using it a lot with my newborn. Thankfully the smaller packaging resists fine but it's a shame the 16-ounce is so fragile."
3,Disappointed.. only received one tube,"I received the product on time, however, there was only one tube. I think when you purchase something, whoever packages the product should make sure the consumer is getting what they paid for."
3,Only Received One Tube,"Very disappointed: This product was advertised on Amazon as a pack of two, but I only received one tube. The price is not worth it for one tube. Addendum (4/6/2011): To Amazon's credit, they quickly rectified the problem, sending me the correct amount within 24 hrs of my initial complaint."
2,not a pack of four,"I really like desitin rash cream but they said in the Product Features* Pack of four, 16-ounce per pack (total of 64-ounces)but i only got one pack...so its only one jar , very disappointed :("
3,"Good concept,but what happened?","This is an incredible for a book. You have one serial killer called ""The Lover"", who places a rose on his victims body. Someone reads about it in the local paper, and he wanted to ""give hornors"" to the ""Lover"", by being a Copycat killer. Just one problem, the Lover isn't flattered, he's mad. Sounds like a *great* idead for a book, right? Well somewhere alone the way, it falls apart. I guess the biggest problem I had was how the ""Lover"" was caught. There was very little cat and mouse play between Keough (the lead detective) and the Lover.Randisi has a decent wrtiing style that will probally keep the reader hooked, but I feel that so much more coulde have been done with this book.Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad read, I just expected a bit more."
2,Formula,"Maybe I'm getting tired of the Detective Mystery Thriller formula containing one dimensional characters - hero detective with unwavering integrity, inept face-saving looking-to-get-ahead police sergeants captains and commissioners, an available lovely single mom next door with adoring daughter.There's a deviant named ""Kopykat"" introduced in the book's prologue who is salivating over newspaper articles about gruesome murders - hmmm...wonder what this guy's all about? <sarcasm>I actually like the characters in this book better than those in Randisi's ""The Sixth Sense"", but because the story isn't as good I rate it 2 instead of 3."
1,Not worth the time.,"I don't know who recommended this book to me, but it was a mistake. Protaganist Keough has the usual personal demons as well as his ""do good"" attitude. He has been transfered to ""police hell"" for beating up a child molester. He then proceeds to see something in a crime that is being ignored by everyone else in the NYPD due to politics.If you want to read a good series with ""personal demons"", read something by James Lee Burke. If you want to read about police procedure read something by Dan Mahoney.There are too many good books out there to be wasting time and money on somethng like this. Hopefully Randisi will improve with experience."
4,1 yo loves this book,"I hate the color scheme and the illustrations in this book (why is the cat bigger than the pig?) but my son loves this book, loves the animal sounds. It is one of the few books he sits still for all the way through, and will even tolerate two or three readings in a row. I borrowed it from the library but am planning on buying this book since he loves it so much. Agree with previous poster, he loves the repetition, not to mention I do get into making realistic animal ""noise"", too. :)"
2,"It works, but mostly has to be close to line of sight in my case.","I wanted to put one downstairs and then upstairs within 30 feet. I know the instructions say that building structures can cause a problem with it, but it really does not work well at all in the one case that I am using it for which is my small church. I moved around to different locations throughout the building seeing if setting off one would set off the next, but it did not work in most cases. It almost has to be line of sight. Originally, I was only going to need two, but after the line of sight problem, I had to change it to four and then added a combination smoke/Carbon Dioxide talking alarm."
2,Extremely limited range,"This is a useful idea which needs work. The alarm portion seems to work as advertised. The voice version is useful to know which alarm was triggered. The problem is very limited range on the linking.The wireless range of the alarm is much less than Z-Wave, Bluetooth or wireless alarm devices, wifi, 900mhz, 2.4, 5.8 or DECT phones. It is comparable to a 1970s kids walkie talkie. Pretty dismal. I had to move the alarms several times in order to get a solid link between two bedrooms separated by a bathroom, the same problem between floors even when the alarms were nearly on top of one another. This is in a stick frame house without foil insulation. The linking feature is not very useful if they have to be within 10 feet of each other.You must test each alarm in the exact installation location with the other alarms in their locations, not just close in the room. This a pretty difficult feat when you have multiple alarms."
4,Love the OneLink Feature!,"We live with my wife's mom to help her as she gets older, and her house is very old and in need of major repairs. To help me sleep better at night I added 4 of these to the key areas of the house. One outside our bedroom, one in her bedroom, one in the kitchen, and one in the basement near the furnace and water heater. We have triggered them when cooking in the kitchen and they all do go off as advertised, so I am happy about that. The silence button also works great too!"
5,best price I could find & the 2 included detectors both alarm due to wireless connection,I wanted the multiple alarm feature because I have a daughter who sleeps very soundly. The 2nd one is outside her door and will alarm for fires in another part of the house. The extra expense of this wireless feature is truly needed if a fire were to occur in a remote part of the house.
4,Great Product for the price,"I purchased this product and the only reason i didnt rate it 5 stars is because I had to send the first one back because it was defective. One speaker was low sound and one of the aux ports didn't work. Amazon's return process was excellent and replacement was lightning fast. Honestly, I thought it was going to be a hassle to return but I have to say I was impressed. Once I received the 2nd unit it worked fantastic. Easy to use/setup, convenient beyond measure and has great sound quality. I would definitely recommend it for any one that does small to medium venues. It accomodated all of my peripherals with ease and I love that it's self contained, packs up neatly and you are on your way. Wasn't too heavy yet sound quality was that of a much larger system. I haven't used it at a larger venue yet but I am confident it would get the job done. Definitely pleased so far."
3,It boils over,"Someone needs to decide if rice cookers are measured by their cooked or uncooked capacity. I think this is really an 8 cup (cooked) rice cooker, not a 16 cup. If we cook the maximum capacity of rice, while it's cooking, it spews rice water out of the top. It does have a warming function, but if we leave the rice in there for several hours, the bottom burns. It's cute, and it does work, but it wasn't really what we were looking for."
2,Not great quality,"It looks fine but as someone reported, the non-stick coating comes off soon. then it becomes tough to clean and difficult to use."
1,bad rice cooker do not buy it,"for 4 months,i did not have any problme.all of a sudden it stopped working.i am an asian and this is the 1st time a rice cooker bailed on me within a few months.Sad part is i cannot even return or get a replacement."
4,Great for the money,"At first I wasn't sure if the color of the metal was going to match my white vanity table, but it does, and with the white seat cover, it all blends together very well. VERY easy to put together! I had it done in 15-20 minutes - just needed a screwdriver. LOVE the little drawer; I keep the extras that didn't fit in my vanity there."
3,"Pretty, but.....","This is a beautiful bra, but the support just is not there! I am a 34 DDD and I just didn't feel ""locked and loaded!"""
1,saudia arabia,"It's comfortable and soft, but priced high compared to the duration of validityUsed only three times in the last time was outdated and very badI purchased from different brands cheaper and keep me at least two yearsDislikes"
2,Not so hot for the less well endowed,"This bra is gorgeous. Unfortunately it doesn't fit terribly well. It's an odd size that's neither a balconet or a demi and pinches in weird places. Also, the underwire digs in painfully after about two hours. The wide lace band is wonderful but for the less chesty, I'd recommend passing on this one."
1,dissappointed!,"I read the other reviews and based on those purchased this bra with high hopes.I am a 36 full cup D.This bra didnt cover anything!!!! Every time you move or particularly bend over everything is out.Yes it is very pretty but not practical,wish I could send it back but I wore it for a few hours..what a waste of money!"
2,"Pretty, but rough coarse fabric - not comfortable","The fit was okay, it is pretty, but not very soft or comfortable. I like the balconette (balcony) style because it flatters a larger busted woman. The straps on a balconette bra set further apart than other bras (straps are more toward your underarm than in the middle of the cup) which I prefer, but with this bra the straps set way too far over nearly at my underarms. The underwire on the sides is one of the most uncomfortable I've ever worn and keeps poking me. I can't wait to take it off when I get home! I should just throw it away. For the price it should have much higher quality (aka softer) lace. Hope this helped!"
5,Sexy for the full bosom,"I have been buying the felina harlow demi cup for nearly eight years now, and it has been the only bra that has balanced sexy with functional. I am a 34dd and most bras in my size range look and feel like over the shoulder boulder holders. This felina bra allows me to wear lower cut shirts without the bra revealing itself, and it creates a very nice ""lift"" and ""separate"" look that no other bra has. It leaves me with a beautiful cleavage line. If they ever discontinue this bra, I will be in big trouble. If you are well endowed up top, this bra just may be for you!"
4,Very Sexy on large breasts,It's hard for you to find sexy natural looking bras when you are a DD. This one is super sexy. I ordered a cup size smaller since I was going for a sexier look and less coverage.
2,Beautiful bra but...,"The fit is terrible. The narrow straps cut into my shoulders, but if they are loosened, the cups don't provide the proper amount of support. You must be the exact right size to wear this bra...comfortably."
2,Just another disappointing bra.........,"Ok, it's a pretty bra, the color is nice & it's overall pretty. Here are my issues: I thought it would have good support due to the band on the bottom; it doesn't. I'm wearing it for the first time & it's already riding up my back after I tightened the straps. Plus, it doesn't give cleavage as the picture suggests, in fact, I feel as through it seperates the breasts & moves them towards the arms rather than towards the center - so much so that I'm getting creases in my shirt between my breasts & when I go home for lunch, I will be changing bras as it's a terrible look. Won't be wearing this one unless it's around the house or when I'm cleaning the house or something. Disappointed."
2,Not that great,Quite flimsy. Doesnt give any support.The seam runs right up the front of the bra and creates bumps under your shirt.
1,Not built right for small women,"Very pretty and well made for sure, however, the bra is very wide so not good for narrow backs. Straps cut into tenter skin near under arm area."
3,It's ok,"I do realize it's unlined, however the bra does not give any support at all. The color which I choose was beige, and I liked that wasn't just one shade of beige, but it had another hue of beige which made the bra pretty. If you want one with more support, don't purchase this one. This bra is good for just hanging around bra."
2,awkward fit,"I was hoping this was like a previous Felina Bra that I lucked out on picking up at a ross. This bra covered too much in my opinion as I was looking for something sexy for a date night. Also it fit kinda weird. For example that fabric directly below the strap was extra taught compared to the rest and made a slight ripple in my breast. (It was probably only noticable to me, but still, did not make me feel sexy."
2,sad,"The bra cup does not fit my breast the way I had expect them to. They are a bit roomy, I'm disappointed."
2,Pretty but....,unfortunately the lacey material and raised seam right down the middle of each breast makes it difficult to wear anything even slightly sheerer than a sweatshirt. :(
2,Didn't work for me...,"I almost liked this bra, but the straps won't shorten up enough. Even when I adjust them to their shortest they're much too long for me. This leaves me pretty much un-hoisted and very frumpy looking! Maybe I'm just built strangely, but I wasn't able to wear this bra. It is pretty though."
2,"nice look, poor coverage",I really wanted to like this. I put it on and looked great. I walked by a mirror 5 min later and I was bulging out already. Maybe be good for smaller chest but didn't work for my 36DD bust.
3,Sexy & Comfy,"I chose 3 stars b/c it is super pretty and I just love the look and feel of it. Unfortunately, it creates red marks on my skin on the sides of my body and is imprinted there for a while and sometimes in the center between the breasts. It is super comfy and I like it a lot but if I had the choice to buy it again, I probably wouldn't."
2,Not a great fit...,"I wear a 38C Bra size, and this bra fits the bill!!! Love it! I just ordered another one. I would highly recommend this bra. It is very sexy, and comfortable.Update:After wearing this bra for a day, it's NOT comfortable. I would not recommend it all, and I have returned the other one that was ordered, and the one I kept goes in the ""Not form fitting, and comfortable"" draw. I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead, so far it is very comfortable, and fits nicely to the breasts. I will be ordering another pair!"
2,Straps are Too Long - Cups are Generous,"I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long. I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose. I've probably only had that problem with 1% of all the bras I've ever bought, and sadly this was one of them. The cups run generously sized (which for me, as a D/DD usually is a positive thing, but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down). The overall design was cute, but the odd sizing made it a no-go."
5,Perfect fit,"I would totally recommend this product. The fabric is soft. I was a little nervous about ordering a bra without having tried it on, but I was very pleasantly surprised when it not only fit perfectly, it is also very comfortable."
3,It's ok... I guess...,"The material is super itchy and scratchy. The support is decent. I wouldn't be able to wear this bra for an extended period of time. Maybe just a short work day or something. Kind of a let down. I was excited to get the bra after reading the reviews. But this fell way, way short of my expectations. Oh well."
4,Harvey changes,He was a rich kid. Nobody liked Harvey because he was mean to everyone. He felt sick and fell overboard.Fishermen saved his life. He learned to fish. He changed his personality. Dan taught him to be a fisherman and a sailor. Long Jack taught him the ropes. Disko taught him how to steer. He caught a dead sailor and Dan showed him how to cut the ropes.At the end he was Dan's best friend and gained the respect of the crew.
2,Book is over by page 20,"I was disappointed by the simplistic plot. The kid falls off the ship at the very beginning of the book. He's rescued, acts like a jerk for a few pages, and then straightens up.There's not much notable to the rest of the book, most of which is spent by Harvey doing chores aboard the boat, waiting until they reach port. No conflict, not much interest.Harvey gets to gloat at the end when it's proven that he really is rich as he claimed. This part of the story is rather embarrassing, with the author unabashedly worshipping success and wealth.(Not that I have anything against success and wealth, but thisdegree of worship is unseemly.)Not one of Kipling's finer works"
4,An Inspired Adaptation of a Classic Coming of Age Adventure Tale,"This could be a difficult book to adapt for a modern children's audience, in that the much of the setting unfortunately is outdated and perhaps not immediately relatable to the Ipod generation.But the adaptation found here manages to score in all categories. Nicely edited for young audiences, and filled with illustrations, this book is great nighttime reading and will captivate boys of all ages. I spent more than a month reading this one with a few of my younger sons and they looked forward to it every night. A can't miss."
3,A highly imaginative book.,"This book by Kipling is impressive.Though it is not as good as Harry Potter and other books it is well thought out and has a good choice of words which improves vocablary immensly. The story is imaginative and the characters of Harvey, Dan Troop and others are well described. Though this book is interesting it does not absorb or engross you. Mr. Kipling did a better job in his other books like Oliver Twist etc. Though the book is original and the hard work is visible it is not any masterpiece. From spoilt children to fishermen the book has its own world. Though I have read it many a time with interest and liked it better each time I have liked Rudyard Kipling's other books better still. It is a great book for sea lovers."
2,Captains Boring,"This is one Kipling opus that didn't age well at all. It depends far too much on an assumed interest by its readership in seafaring and the culture of the fishermen of old New England. Page after page after page. Then after that there's a lot of gee-whiz-ain't-he-rich stuff that gets old fast. And all the while these two teenage boys are having this great time working their butts off in the sheer drudgery of manual labor. With all that, it's very hard not to fall into an abject slumber and then to wake up fervently wishing this particular read was all over. Hey, you want a good book about a guy who gets picked up at sea and gets forced to work for his keep? ""The Sea Wolf,"" of course! It's a 10!"
2,Plotless,"A lot of the people that gave this book a low rating are lucky that they were not forced to read it for summer homework like I was. I am at the second to last chapter and so far there has been no suspense, or plot, it is just a kid doing chores and catching fish. The way the sailors talk is anoying but easy to get over, the overal story however is hard to understand, many of the terms used are words that not many people know, and when the virgin comes out of the water, well what the !@#$ is the virgin what dose it look like? The author dose not say. There are some exiting moments but the book is overall boring. Mabey it's just the school's fault for making kids going into 7th grade read this type of book. I think an Adult would enjoy this book much more than I did. If you are a kid then you should probably not get this book."
2,Boring,This book is very boring. The characters (except for Harvey) speak very poorly which makes them very hard to understand. There are a lot of ain'ts which drives me crazy. This book seems to jump from one thing to the next. They might be talking about cod and the next minute they talk about cattle. It is one of those classics which was appealing back then but not now. Captain's Courageous is about a spoiled boy who transforms into a good person with the help of some fishermen...This book has made my top three dullest books I have ever read.
1,Captain,this is the worst book I have ever read. I just cant get into it I sometimes felt like throwing against the wall.
1,WARNING! Do not buy this book!,"This book is by far the stupidest, most boring and hard to understand books in the history of all books. It was like torture having to read this pointless book. The characters do not make any sense when talking! See if you can figure this out: ""Lay a-holt o' that tackle, then. Behind ye!"" And does anyone know what ""Pshaw!"" means? This is a boring book and I would never hope that a poor soul has to ever read this book again in the history of mankind!"
1,Highly suggest against buying S&W branded watches,"Let me bottom line this for you. If you want a bad-boy Microtec based tritium watch, then buy a Traser, Luminox or KHS. All the other ones I've run into are cheap and a weak excuse for a hardcore watch. I purchased one of these S&W's to replace a broken Luminox. I sent it back the first day I got it. It was very cheap and the illumination was very poor. I then bought a Traser from LA Police Gear, and was very happy with it. If you want the badest of the bad, check out the German KHS with the blue tritium...very cool. Best price-to-performance goes to the Traser watches, hands down. All my cop buddies agree with me on this! (except my buddy who dropped $350 on a KHS, but I think he need to tell himself that to justify spending over twice as much for basicly the same watch!) Hope this Helps!"
3,"Good watch for the money, but BIG difference in tritinum quality","I feel the S&W; tritinum watch is a good value and good looking watch. I've worn a Luminox watch for the past couple of years and it's still going strong. I bought the Uzi to see how well it holds up to me, as I can be rough on watches.The Uzi and the S&W; tritinum watches are only about half as bright as the Luminox. I suppose that is why the Uzi is about a third of the cost of a Luminox. In total darkness, you can glance at a Luminox and tell the time. With an Uzi or S&W;, you'll need to really focus in on the watch to tell the time."
1,This price is high for a used 2006 book which is a part of a set,A used book which is a part of a set by 35$!The price is high!
5,A swimmingly wonderful read!,"I'm very picky as to what books I read...and even more so which ones I enjoy. That said, I absolutely loved The Mermaid of Penperro. It was funny, and it was sexy. The characters were real to me, and their actions rang true. Best of all, the story and the characters stayed with me for a long, long time afterward. If ever you wanted a book with which to sink into the tub with (it *does* take place by the sea, afterall) and say, ""ahhhhh,"" then this is IT. I look forward to this author's next work, and all her books to come."
1,QUALITY OF THE DOMINOES,The first day we used these dominoes the NY logo completely came off the dominoes. I was really disappointed that with a one time use this would happen.
3,"Some good, some bad","This is a cool heavy duty case, BUT the door is always getting snagged and pulled open. The trouble with that is the phone is just sitting inside and it falls out, defeating the purpose of a case. After getting many scratches on my new phone, I figured out a not-so-sexy solution; I use a rubber band around the case to avoid having the door open so easily and therefore keeping the phone inside where it should be. Again, a pretty good rough and tumble case, but you gotta work at keeping that door closed."
3,OK dvd,This Dvd is pretty good... but it only has 4 songs so I returned it because I thought I was getting a full DVD. Other than that songs were good.
1,Completely outdated. This is all bunk.,"This is the book the wine industry wants you to read. It is completely out of date. It makes the well known case that wine is good for your because it reduces your risk of cardiovascular disease. What it does not say, because we did not know it back then, is that wine (like any alcohol)consumption is a risk factor for breast and prostate cancers. It is also really bad for cognitive skills for obvious reasons.There are far better ways to get the cardiovascular risk reduction benefit of wines. These include eating red grapes, and doing cardiovascular exercises."
4,Nice Groove to this album,I'm a metal fan but just now giving Iron Maiden a listen. Heard a lot of these songs on pandora so I decided to get this album as I liked more than 1/2 the songs played on it.Worth it!
1,Flight from Dallas,"This book has to be one of the most trivial books ever printed on the subject of the assassination of JFK. It is 107 pages long, with large print which is double spaced, and takes a casual reader less than three hours to finish. In the end, it proves absolutely nothing. In my opinion, this is one book that is truly not worth the time or the money."
1,Terrible!,"I don't usually post reviews, but after reading this book, and the other reviews, I really feel that I must. In my opinion, this was one of the worst books I've read in a long time, and I'm a voracious reader. Very little actually happened in the story, most of the characters were boring, and their actions and dialogue were predictable.Although it's been several years since I read any of Ms. Henley's novels, I do not remember those older ones being as poorly written and uninteresting as this one. If you enjoy this genre, there are many books by other authors that are much more enjoyable from which to choose. Don't waste your time and money on this one.If I could give the book 0 stars, I would."
1,"Oh, Yuk","My God, where are these authors going. This is porn. I would have actually loved this book. Beth, what a story it could have been. Historical and all. I just couldn't get past the non-romance, non-feeling, do depth of relationship, yuk, that is love? Are these new ""romance"" historical/regencey, etc. written for women? No way, not for me. I think there were pages and pages I skipped through of pure porn. Just took away from the story, terribly. Just such a shame. Where is the touch, the look, the word's, the tenderness, all that would make a women feel? So sad. If you're into the porn genre, then this book is for you."
1,One last thing ...,"I think I forgot to mention that I destroyed my copy of this book. For a while I thought about returning it to the bookstore and getting my money back, but then I decided that I didn't even want anyone else to be able to buy it. I only wish that I could rip apart every existing copy of this book ... sorry, Virginia."
5,First time Henley reader,"I'm an avid historical romance reader and just picked this book up the other day on a whim. I had never read anything by Virginia Henley. I have my favorite authors and usually stick to reading only thier books. Well, I can add this author to my list of favorites. I was not disappointed in this book or this authors ability to write her knowledge of the 18th century. It is a riviting story that has true romance along with the reality of lifes hardships in marriage and life in general. I am looking forward to reading more by this author."
1,disappointed,"I loved the music in the movie...the soundtrack did not include all the upbeat music, just 20 minutes of the dreamy tune of the funeral/tai chi scenes. Very disappointing!"
2,First impressions didn't last,"We bought the gourmet food and snacks gift basket as a birthday present.My wife talked to the recipient on the day of her birthday and she was delighted, but...A second phone call several days later included mention of the gift.""Where did you get this?"" she asked. ""Don't waste your money again"".According to her report, the gift was mostly boxes, boxes within boxes, and little content.Getting accurate feedback from those who receive gift baskets and similar products is problematic--the recipient (unlike our friend!) is usually concerned about hurting the feelings of the giver when they are disappointed."
4,"Nice Basket, No note","From what I heard, the basket was nice and delivered on time but the recipient had no idea who sent it. Despite my well worded thank you note (the gift was a small token of appreciation)that I had entered in the appropriate box on the order form, there was nothing included. The recipient eventually called Amazon and found out who had sent it. This was embarrassing and a let down on what good service I have grown to expect from Amazon."
1,A terrible gift,The folks who received it told me to ask for a credit. Stale and terrible looking. I did get the requested credit.
2,Nothing to brag about but ok,I probably won't get this product again. It was ok but barely. It was smaller than I gathered from the photo and the assortment of food items inside were ok but no more than products I could have bought at the local grocery store.Not a bad gift but not something I would recommend.
1,Very Disappointing,I gave this as a Christmas gift for my brother in Arizona. Because I have never used this service before I asked him for feedback. He said the products were not very good and seemed skimpy. I will be going back to Harry and David in the future.T Lynch Tucson
2,"Bad taste, nice look, fast delivred","I don't like it because the taste of product is bad, but the look is nice to provide a gift."
2,Gift Basket,"This basket was VERY small...nothing like the photo..although the contents was good, it didn't make a big impression upon delivery."
3,Not Worth Owning,"Decent story about underdog pro team - but is often told through weak interviews and low quality race footage.First half of the film is slow, we hear about why the wife of one cyclist likes being a teacher so much (helping people) and the race sequences cut from very amateur fixed shots of racers going by to post race commentary on what was happening at specific points in the race but not really captured on camera.Things pick up in the second half of the film as a few big races are covered in detail with better video footage that follows groups of riders for longer.Overall, I enjoyed the film but it is not nearly as good as other cycling docs I've seen (hell on wheels, lance armstrong road to paris, etc) and I'm dissappinted I spent so much money to buy it."
5,Finally!,"This text is a superbly written and seriously scholarly product that provides the fundamental basis, based on a foundation of thorough legal analysis of documented events, for formulating what amounts to an indictment of the behaviors of a traitor. The text is fascinating but nevertheless maintains a rigorous adherence to analyses of various data bases, and provides the reader with a fine example of integrated logic and reasoning in what could easily have been be a purely emotional treatise which typically characterizes much of the published articles concerning Ms. Fonda's behaviors in time of war."
3,Hollywood Traitor,"It was stupid of Jane Fonda to make a statement against the war from the seat of an anti-aircraft gun. The authors make a good case for treason, but the United States was not officially at war, which questions the validity of the charges.I served in Vietnam from 1970-71 and can tell you that the troops would have welcomed Jane Fonda as a performer in a USO show much more than her eventual 1972 performance.For all who now say that the events of 1972 are immaterial, what would be the consequence today of a Hollywood personality appearing in Bhagdad in support of the Baathist Party?Never forget that after the fall of South Vietnam, over 80,000 of their people were systematically murdered by the communists that Jane Fonda supported.For those who really care, we would love to hear Jane Fonda say that she made a mistake. Afterall, Jimmy Carter granted amnesty to thousands of draft dodgers."
1,Time to Move On--Get Relevant,"I don't know where the Holzers have been living since the Seventies but America and the world have a whole new set of problems and responsibilities without harping on ancient history. This mountain-from-a-molehill--from its arcane ""reasoning"" to its surgical slicing and dicing of quotes--is a diatribe by some sad old zealots unable to accept that time and public opinon have left them behind in the ash pile of cultural irrelevance. Published by a vanity press--what more do you need to say? Move on."
1,Time to Move On,"Where have the authors been for the past 30 years?Times have moved on. Yet the writers seem to be stuck in this time warp where this matter is still relevant. Like it or not, Jane Fonda's visit happend - end of story.The US goverment have bigger fish to fry than a 65 year old actress living in Georgia.-- This book is great for Vets and patriots that just wont move on, or atlease feel the world still owes them some thing.Though I disagree with the book's conclusions, in fairness, the authors set a clear argument with their reasons why Jane Fonda should be tried for treason and use as many facts as possible (instead of lies)"
1,Not what's pictured or described...,"I ALWAYS buy Avery stuff to use, and thought it would just be easier to get it on Amazon rather than go to the office supply store. I did not get the blue and yellow package, I received two beat up off-white packages (that looked like they'd been opened before and with tattered corners) with EVERYTHING labeled in Spanish. Then when I opened them, they weren't heavyweight at all. They were flimsy and barely thicker than a regular piece of paper. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE, perhaps if they were the actual ones that I thought I was getting I could rate them higher.Here is the link that amazon provided for the item: [...]and the seller is John Dealoni/fulfilled by Amazon"
1,Too many problems,"First off -- you're paying for quality card stock. But the results don't look that great.Second -- again you are paying for quality -- the tears are not that that neat. You have to go back and tear off little pieces small enough to be hard to grip.Third -- let's see a three by five card on 8.5 x 11 sheet. You could put four on this and they only have three. You throw away a lot of paper -- and get 25% fewer cards.In summation, you are paying too much. I'm buying a paper cutter."
3,meh...,"Used these to make my bartending flashcards. While they certainly got the job done, I think they are much too expensive.I wouldn't really recommend them for anything other than recipe cards that you plan to laminate. Probably wouldn't recommend you go through the expense of it. If you messed up a few pages, you'll definitely regret it."
5,Avery Index Cards,Avery Laser & Ink Jet White 3 x 5 Inch Index Cards 150 Count (5388)This product exceeded my expectations.
2,TOO FLIMSY FOR MAILING,"Hi, it may just be me but when I read the words ""Heavyweight Cards,"" I thought I could use them for postcards (I'm entering a sweepstakes and planned to put stamps on them and mail them individually. But, I opened the package a few mins ago and just so you know the paper is pretty thin. So thin that when you hold up a single sheet the whole thing just flops over and bends very easily.I guess if you're just using these for personal use at home for recipes of something they will do, but they don't seem to be for mailing. Big waste."
4,"If you like Tudor houses, you'll enjoy this book","Fine examples of a type of photorealistic drawing that you don't see anymore, which are reason enough to buy the book. The majority of homes are Tudor or Old English, like the ones on the cover, with just a few Colonials and Bungalows mixed in. The writing is quaint, with bedrooms called chambers, and mentions of breakfast nooks, servant's quarters, and telephone cabinets."
4,Interesting book,"I am gathering ideas for creating a Tudor style home floorplan, and this book is full of Tudor Revivals (and some other styles too), so it was extremely helpful. I am a fan of the 1920's in general, so I found the entire book interesting to browse. I'm not sure that this book has a very broad appeal, but certainly worth looking at for someone interested in architectural history or Tudor homes."
3,A Good Cavalry Story,"Louis L'Amour can be depended upon to always deliver a workmanlike novel that offers an entertaining story with the flavor of the ""Old West"" and he has done so again here. The author herein provides a tale of the U.S. Cavalry on the frontier confronted with an Indian uprising while the cavalry commander must also cope with the re-appearance of an old romantic rivalry whom he fears will try again to steal away his wife. The story comes complete with a couple of good ""Indian fights"" and the inevitable confrontation between our hero and the principal bad guy, among other features. I would not declare this to be one of Louis L;Amour's best western novels but its far from his worst and is a good enjoyable read."
1,Major disappointment,"Kilrone was my first L'Amour book to ever read, and needless to say I was extremely disappointed. I was expecting L'Amour novel events to be more plausible. At times, a better description of some of Kilrone's feats would probably be defined as ludicrous. Kilrone during the fort siege jumped astride a gray horse bareback. I found it odd that Kilrone later during that same day on the ride away from the fort, he reaches for the pommel, without mention of ever finding a saddle along the way. The ending to the novel was very rushed -- absolutely nothing flowed well. If anyone is considering a L'Amour book to read, maybe it is best he/she chooses another."
3,the coolest coloring book ever!,one time i got this coloring book because i am a famous madigician it is fun who ever gets it enjoy it
3,I was expected the original box,"Even the optical mouse has a good price, the experience was a little disappointment when I opened the postal service little box and the mouse was covered in a translucent plastic bag, I was expecting the mac original box, that made doubt about the originality of it."
2,One Button?,"... The mouse itself is a big button and there is only one mouse. I love Apple and I am a apple user since many years, this this is weak. When will apple learn that you can work better with 2 buttons and a scrollwheel? I guess, never. Otherwise the mouse is normal optical mouse standard. I can only recomment to buy this one if you have a complete apple system and don't want to ruin the good overall looks. Careful: Like with every optical mouse: Use a one color surface to operate the mouse on. Otherwise the pointer is goin to jump all over the screen.My pro's and con's:Pro:Very good design.Good quality.Precise operation.Con:No Wheel.Only one button."
3,Mine is still new and unused...,"... and sitting in my iMac G5's box. I feel crippled without a scroll wheel or right-button, so I went out and bought a Microsoft Blue Optical mouse instead (their mice are about the only decent thing Microsoft sells). I thought Apple had finally figured it out with the Mighty Mouse, but I was disappointed."
4,Cool but no right-click.,"I like this mouse, except that it does not have a right-click button. For older Mac OS's, though, this does not matter. Pushing Control while clicking works. If I didn't need right-click, the one-click feature of this mouse is actually kind of cool."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"It was my fault as I don't know enough about the different variety and I chose one that really doesn't suit my needs in the office, however, it will be fine to have around as a spare."
2,Click sounds like a tree branch breaking,Click noise is ridiculously loud. Steve Jobs clearly had nothing to do with approving this design. Can't believe Apple actually made something this annoying to use.
3,Apple Mouse,"Pros:-Nice feel-Easy USB connection-Eye appealingCons:-Short wire-No scroll wheel-I WANT RIGHT CLICK!!!This mouse is of very high quality, but has many flaws to it. First of all, the wire is SO short that you can't really move it from place to place. Secondly, there is no scroll wheel so you can't easily scroll down a page. Most importantly, THERE IS NO RIGHT CLICK!!! A mouse of this price and appeal should definitly have a right click feature."
3,Pretty okay,"I was expecting the mouse to have a little less wear, but the wear is purely cosmetic. However it functions perfectly fine, and a good buy for the price."
3,Aple Optical Mouse,"I received this mouse on time. Customer service is great! It did not work out for me. The item was as describe, but had other damages that were not noticed by seller. Seller's words! Seller provided a full refund, including my return shipping expense. I don't know why this mouse did not work, because my Mac is not that old. But, at any rate. I had a USB regular PC mouse that it is working fine. I don't know what is going on with this item."
