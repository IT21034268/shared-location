1,BORING!!!,"One of the worst movies I've seen, terrible acting, incredibly slow, funny (they didn't mean it to be funny thou), BORING and not scary at all. A really stupid film-"
2,Don't Let The Cover and name fool you....,this movie is not scary and it is boring slow moving and stupid.
2,Glad I read the above comment,"I was about ready to throw my 18V battery away and order a new one, then read the comment about ""jumping"" the battery. The battery would not take a charge and thought for sure it was dead. Then, I took a 9V battery and held it against the contacts (positive is the single lead) and sure enough now the battery is taking a charge.BTW - I've been very happy with the combo pack (6.5"" circular, reciprocal, hammer drill and flashlight). When I ordered the combo Milwaukee sent me the AM/FM Radio which is great for the garage or contruction site."
1,"runs for 5 minutes on the ""hatchet""","This battery is awful. Brand new fully charged will run on the milwaukee hatchet (6514) for may be 5 minutes. It runs even less on the cordless circular saw. It needs a sticker that say ""running hamster inside"". What a joke!"
1,Poorly built 18v battery,I have Milwaukee 18v tools and the batteries are dying one at a time. They will not take a charge. I wrote the comapny and all they could tell me was to place it on the charger overnight and give it trickle charge. Well I had them on the charger for a week and they are still dead. I have Dewalt 18v batteries and they have never let me down. I was out of the country for over a year and all I had to do was place them on the charger and I was good to go. I will not buy another Milwaukee tool again.
1,Bad Battery Life,Milwaukee obviously has a problem with their 18 VDC NiCad battery line. My first battery failed at just over a year. The second battery delivers low power (torque) and requires replacement. I will not spend $80.00 to replace these batteries so I am looking for a rebuild of the battery packs by a third party or I will scrap the tool. Not interested in being trapped by Milwaukee into continuously replacing batteries.
1,Jump starting workes!,"I also have two of these with a 1/2"" drill. After maybee 5 charges one wouldn't charge. I jumped it with a 9v battery as suggested above and it is now charging. Because of the ignorance on Milwaukee reguarding this problem this is the last Milwaukee tool I will buy. I am regerstered at Milwaukee with many of there tools. They know how to get in touch. This is a shameful showing for customer care."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"While I did recieve a Milwaulkee battery, I was under the destinct impression that I was getting the power plus type. That`s what the product representation was.Have doubts if I can trust that I would get what I expect if I were to try to purchace something there again.thank you for asking"
3,Thanks DP!,"I was just looking online to replace a dead Milwaukee 48-11-2230. I have had mine (I have two battery packs) for a few years, but I dont use them very frequently.I discovered one of them was completely dead but wouldnt charge on the charger. I found myself here and read DP'S trick. I gave it a try and it worked like a charm!"
4,"good but not great,best battery milwaukee makes","its a good battery but not as good as others, that being said the drill is great the weak part is the battery,i own 6 other cordless best tool but low end battery"
1,I have three Milwaukee drills without batteries,"The 18v NiCad was the worst of all. After it stopped getting charged, opened it, the cells had leaked and the terminals rusted. No hope of bringing it back. I am in the market for a new 18v cordless but no brand has impressed me yet. The three drills(two 14.4v and one 18v- almost new as the two batteries died in about one year after I purchased them) have been great but no batteries, the worst in the world. Bye Bye Milwaukee!!"
5,Milwaukee battery,Per our Plant Director the batteries were fine and half the price. Ordering was easy and batteries were shipped on time.
1,Milwaukee 18 volt Cordless Set,"Iv'e got to agree with other reviews on this set-Great Tools,The worst battery life on the market.I have had 14.4 Dewalt tools and a Sears 12 volt drill for 5-6 years,no problems.The Milwaukee batteries went dead in less than a year,within 3 weeks of each other."
1,Garbage,"Milwaukee makes great tools although they really blew this one. My 18v batteries have a life of about 6 months to a year and then they are complete GARBAGE. The battery cells go completly dead and there is zero life in the battery. I am very surprised at Milwaukee for having lousy batteries for their tools. I have other brands that the batteries last years and years, not this one."
1,pretty sorry batteries,"Like others, I love the Milwaukee drill but the batteries get an ""F"" only because that is the lowest grade I can give them. Milwaukee is totally unsympathetic when you talk to them. I lost a battery in a short time without getting much use out of it and they are spendy to replace. Again, love the drill but will definitely not buy another Milwaukee tool because of the batteries. There are plenty of other good power tools with batteries that last much longer; one would think that Milwaukee would recognize the problem and try to make their customers happy, but I guess that isn't in the cards. Anyway, unless you love to replace the battery for your power tools along with the batteries in your smoke detector twice a year, find something else."
1,Also had bad 18v battery,I though my experience was isolated until I read these reviews. One of my 2 18v Circular saw batterys stopped working after about a year of non constant use. (my 14.4v Milwaukee drill batteries have been working fine for 4 or 5 years). After reading these reviews and seeing the price of the 18v battery I am very suspicious of buying any more cordless Milwaukee tools. (Even though I am VERY happy with the tools themselves). I have just sent Milwaukee customer service an email telling them this. I don't mind paying a lot of money for a GOOD tool that will LAST. I would have been a loyal Milwaukee customer... but I will begin looking for another quality tool maker that has BETTER BATTERIES.
1,Bad batteries!,"Take these reviews seriously about the Milwaukee 18v batteries. I was as loyal as they come on Milwaukee drills until I lost the last of (4) batteries in three years. Milwaukee has not even made an effort to release a better designed battery. Even at Ebay prices, over $250 lost in batteries! The drill will sure last a long time now, if I can just spin it fast enough by hand..."
5,good deal,"I bought my boyfriend a 5 Milwalkee piece tool set four years ago and the batteries have worn out, he was so happy to plug this one in and have charge. It was a good deal at this price, I had been pricing them at $75. and thought that was a bit much. thank you."
2,Limited life,"This is the battery that originally came with my Milwaukee drill and drill/hammer (I own both). While the battery has good power and provides a lot of work between charges, it has a very limited life. I replaced them after 6 to 8 months of light to moderate use. After a while they just die and refuse to charge.I have since replaced them with the new lithium-ion batteries offered by Milwaukee. The new batteries are much lighter, provide more power, and have a five year warranty. Much better way to go."
3,"Good power, good run time, poor life span","I use the batteries with my Milwaukee 18v Cordless Drill for projects around my home. I have been very impressed with the cordless drill, but not with the batteries. The batteries are powerful and have a decent run time on a single charge, however the battery will fail after many (hundreds of) charge / discharge cycles. One of my first batteries failed after about a year's use, the second is still working. I contacted Milwaukee and their response was that a years use was reasonable and if it had failed within that first year it would have been covered by warrantee.Batteriies should be viewed as a consumable."
1,Dud Battery,Batterry would not take charge had to be returned for a refund did not have replacement.
4,battery fixed!,"I've owned 2 of these batteries for about 3 years. One died today, and I wasn't able to charge it. I tried ""jumping"" it with a 9 volt and it charged perfectly! Great idea. saved me the cost of a new one. ...just make sure you're making good contact for about 30 seconds. ..it took me a couple of tries, but all is good again."
1,Piece of crap,"Bought 2 of these worthless batteries. Worked one time, then would not take a charge. Will never waste my money again on these batteries. Went and bought 2 non NiCad batteries, and they work and charge great. Love my Milwaukee Sawzall and drill, it's just the NiCad that SUCKED!!!! Bet I don't get 2 new free ones!!!"
1,"Thanks to DP for saving my ""dead"" Milwaukee batteries with a cheap 9V","For those who, like me, are frustrated with dead Milwaukee batteries, DP's trick -- place a standard 9V battery against the leads on your dead Milwuakee battery for 30 seconds (single lead on your Milwaukee is positive, the double lead is negative) -- sure did work for me. Thanks to DP for saving me $100+.The folks at Milwaukee deserve to be sued not only for making crappy batteries but for not publicizing this incredibly easy (and cheap) way to fix them. This ought to be on their website's FAQ."
1,Not worth the price,"Two of these batteries came with my drill. The drill has seen occasional heavy homeowner use. The first battery failed to take a charge shortly after the warranty expired - battery warranties are 1 year. The second started failing shortly after. According to other Amazon reviews, this is a known problem.I absolutely LOVE the drill. It's a real workhorse, but $175 for batteries every 2 years is outrageous."
3,"Fixing a ""dead"" Milwaukee battery","Although I love my Milwaukee drill, I too was frustrated with what appeared to be a dead battery in a short period of time. When looking to purchase a new one, I saw the review from DP and his trick of using a standard 9v battery to get the Milwaukee battery charge high enough so that the standard charger will recognize it. DP's little trick worked like a charm!! My ""dead"" battery is now up and running again.Makes ver glad that I use Amazon often."
5,Milwaukee 18 volt tools,I am a very big fan of the 18 volt line. I have six 18 volt devices and use them daily working plant maintenance for a manfacturing plant. I purchased these tools over two years ago and am still on the original set of batteries. It is advisable to follow the manfacture's instructions for proper care and maintence of the batteries as with any NiCad batteries.
4,Good mystery suspense movie,"I agree dont watch the preview because it will affect the suspense of the movie. Otherwise a decent mystery/suspense movie. The acting was good and I like the way the story progresses and then how it goes back and tells you what happened giving you the perspective of what transpired from the other main characters view.....while the motives of the individuals in the story line are flawed....the story line it self makes it a unique suspense story.........reminding me a bit of a kinda twilight story because of the twists that occur.........almost expected Rod Serling to appear to give the moral of the story as he did in the Twilight series.....""There are weapons that are simply thoughts. For the record, prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy.""Rod Serling"
4,Edge of your seat entertainment,Good plot. Expect the unexpected. Edge of your seat entertainment. Never sure where the story will go. And then a surprise ending.
4,Awesome movie with a moral lesson,"The short ""Hidden face"" movie catch my attention every minute since it started: suspense, drama, action and love. I think and analyze which one could be my hidden face or others ones from this experience. Did not liked the end but hope they would consider the next ""Hidden Face II"".."
5,I'm liking this,This is a good import adding If I Can't is a good move I hope they keep doing what there doing.
1,Where is the 0 star rating?,"G-Unit is so terrible on this single that I don't even know where to begin. I listened to the whole thing and felt sick afterward that such untalented people can become so popular today's world. Anyone who would buy this stupid album obviously have no since of either music or taste. I will also say that if G-Unit was put on a stage and asked to rap about anything other that guns, sex and money, they would be completely clueless. I pitty all of the people who would spend money to see these idiots live because from what I heard of them on this worthless CD, they can't even perform on stage. All and all, they are a no talent, worthless group of people who are only contributing to the demise of the music industry."
5,Women Who Break the Rules Unite!,"It is refreshing to see this book, with its women of various backgrounds and cultures showing the determination to live their lives by the rules they choose, instead of what their individual societies forced upon them at differing times in our history. From the earliest record in what was New Amsterdam, to more recent times, I enjoyed at times a thrilling view of some women of New York I had not heard of but whose nerve and determination helped put women in the position we now enjoy in America, and New York in particular. Women who, in the face of rejection of their communties or downright danger still said ""My way or the highway!"" This book takes them from their obscurity and shows them as the courageous beings they were. Very inspirational!"
1,Thumbs Down For Wool Pillow,"I ordered this item after seeing it recommended in a ladies magazine I receive monthly. They are ususally a reliable source for finding great products. The wool pillow was recommended for folks who have a problem with night sweating, especialy in the head and neck area. It worked for this problem but went flat in about three days. I still have the return form, but it would be more trouble for me to return than to just keep it and throw it in the ""bought but didn't deliver"" pile. The retailer that I purchased it from through Amazon.com, Pro-Health, was great to deal with as far as service but not much help with the quality problem. I will certainly do more research next time."
4,Her voice is much like Trisha Yearwoods,I absolutely love this album!!!1.) Strong Anything 4/52.) No End In Sight 5/53.) The Breakup Song 4/54.) I Want A Cowboy 5/55.) Unbreakable 5/56.) Flowers By The Side Of The Road 2/5 ( I don't like songs like this.)7.) Drop Dead Gorgeous 5/58.) Normal 4/59.) I Won't Say Goodbye 5/5( My Favorite song on the album)10.) Home Running Away 4/511.) Prelude To The Kiss 4/5
4,Good listening,"This is a great CD. Every song has a good beat and a lot of heart, especially the track titled ""Flowers by the Side of the Road."" ""I want a Cowboy,"" is a fun knee slappin song. You can't go wrong with this CD."
3,A real pop rock production,"Katrina has a great voice, but other than her hit ""No End In Sight"", if she doesn't get some better material and more country sounding production, the end is in sight. I was surprised at how hard rockin the guitars were on most of the CD. Everything was uptempo. She wrote all of the songs and they just were not all that good. I see a lot of potential, but someone should have taken more time with this CD."
2,Not Country,"She has an ok voice but Why Nashville markets this as country I will never understand. Most of the songs are more rock/pop than country. Pop ""country"" artist are a dime a dozen in Nashville these days. Her choice of song are ok but not great. If you are a fan of pop ""country"" you will probably enjoy this album."
5,Love you Katrina!!!!,"At first I didn't think I would like this album, but I decided to buy it since they kept playing her on the radio. And its great!!!1.) Strong Anything 5/52.) No End In Sight 5/5 (one of my fav songs on the album)3.) The Breakup Song 5/5 (nice ballad, lyrics are great)4.) I Want a Cowboy 5/55.) Unbreakable 4/56.) Flowers by the side of the road 5/5 (beautiful song)7.) Drop Dead Gorgeous 5/5 (Best fast song on this album)8.) Normal 5/5 (True lyrics and one of my favorites)9.) I Won't Say Goodbye 5/510.) Home Runnin Away 5/5 (My fav slow song)11.) Prelude to Kiss 2/5 (My least fav, I always skip it)All in all this album is really great. So go and buy it."
5,A storm from Oklahoma is coming to Nashville!!!,"I even felt the wind gusts all the way up here in Pennsylvania.Katrina's 1st career single ""No End In Sight"" just blew me away. I have listened to music for over 20 years and never had a song that took me out by storm. When I heard it on the radio for the first time -- I said to myself -- WOW! That is quite a song! Katrina's freshman album is one of the best 1st albums I heard in nearly 14 years. Other songs I like a lot from the album are ""The Break Up Song"", ""Unbreakable"", and ""I Won't Say Goodbye"" and I am anxious and curious when her next single will be released. Katrina is on her way to big success and it is just only the beginning! Katrina is hot country! Want an talent heart felt album -- Get Katrina Elam's self-titled album!Scotty AstiKatrina Elam's Fan Club Memeber"
5,Back to the old days,This book takes you back to the days of Dale Lee and Ben Lilly and tells stories of how they hunted lions. It is a book for those who are intersted in hearing old stories and tales of some of the greatest lion hunters ever. As you read you find yourself standing on the rim rock looking into the jagged country and hearing the dogs baying and working the track across the canyon bottom. It is a very good read for lion hunters of today because Hibben puts into words what we expereince on a day to basis chasing lions in the rough and tough back country. It is also a great book for those who have ever wondered what it would be like to hunt lions with dogs or those who think hound hunting is not a sport. Once you have read this book hopefully you will have a better understanding of one of the greatest traditions in North America.
5,Brilliant,"This is a fabulous survey of Kodaly's complete piano music, replete with noble, spirited playing and a wonderfully captured sound. Highly recommended."
5,milwaukee tool bag,"this bag is very big and nice. the shoulder strap was missing the clip and is unusable, but the bag is very good."
5,"Excellent bag, not ""just for tools""","This is a great bag for tools, but it also serves well as a carry on bag for airline flights, or just about any type of travel. The bright red and black colors make it easy to identify anywhere. The previous reviewer who gave it only two stars is obviously rating his own mistake, milwaukee cant be responsible for him not measuring correctly, or not at all.Buy it , you will like it. Dusty bob"
2,shoulda measured better,"I shoulda measured better. I thought I was ordering the bag that came with mt 4 piece tool set. Not so, this bag is much smaller, but very well made, not big enuf for portable saws but good for smaller tools like drills n hand tools. Dan Briggs"
4,OLD TO THE NEW!,"I collect CD singles to put onto my itunes library because the quality sounds better from vinyl. Also I have these same songs on vinyl and so far,so good."
1,"All ""super-long hair"" ponies are NOT equal. . .","When I ordered this pony I received a yellow ""Sparklesnap"" super-long hair pony. It is not an exceptionally cute pony, and is NOT what I thought I was ordering from the photo/description/customer comments. The only thing in common is that it has ""super-long hair"". It comes with tiara, barrettes, and brush. . .no baby. It is certainly not the Aloha Pearl and baby Bellaluna I THOUGHT I was ordering. I'm very disappointed--these were birthday favors and the yellow Sparklesnap won't do!"
5,Beautiful!,I had these specially imported from the US as there is no such thing as a TRU in NZ. Overall this set of Aloha Pearl and Baby Bellaluna are beautiful. Perfect for the older collectors and the newer generation!
4,Very good product,This product met my expectations. It was simple to install and is easy to use. My grandchildren enjoy using it with me and it is helping to teach them about recycling.
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I was excited to recieve my new crusher, as my old one had bitten the dust about a week before the new one arrived, and the cans were really piling up. I got it mounted on the wall, and put the first can into it. . . and the sides bent out and it was useless!! I managed to get it to crush three cans. Dont waste your money on this one!!"
2,"Crusher works great, but!!!!!!","The crusher does its job. However, where they placed the rivits on the thing get caught when you bring the handle back up after crushing the can. Very sturdy, but poor design."
1,Junk,"This product fell apart. The rivets did not hold up for more that about 2 months. Now ir is hanging on the wall beside my recycle bin, just taking up space."
3,Use it correctly and it will last a couple of years,I think some of the people who report bending the arm are perhaps not being very careful in how they use this thing. After two years of use (and crushing god only knows how many soda cans) I've had no problem with the arm. The problem that I have is that the metal in the bottom has bent somewhat so cans sometimes slip out when I'm crushing them. I'm going to get a new one but I don't expect it to last more than a few years. That will do. Oh and be sure to squeeze a good dent into any can before crushing it. If you crush undented cans with this thing I'm sure it will break in no time.
4,I don't understand the bad reviews.,"I got this at Ace Hardware (the box says ""The Can Smasher"" but it is the very same item pictured here). It's a very solid product. I always squeeze the can just a touch before putting it in the crusher, slowly pull the handle, and it flattens it with hardly any effort at all.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's not the prettiest thing you could have in your kitchen. Luckily, I have black and silver appliances, so it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb too terribly. If it ends up breaking later on down the road, I'll come back and report it, but I haven't had any trouble with it at all.Update January 22, 2012:This is still in the same shape it was when purchased, and we crush a heck of a lot of cans around here. It's held up beyond my expectations."
2,"Great idea, but fragile...","A can cusher is a great item to have if you have limited space to store your aluminum cans prior to recycle pick (or want to minimize the number of trips to the recycle center). I had this one, and it worked pretty well, but the handle fell apart after about six months, so it is unusable. Not a great design overall."
1,Poor quality,"We crushed about 5 cans and the ""Heavy Gauge Steel With Soft Grip Handle"" bent and no longer works. Buyer beware."
1,Cheap construction,I bought one of these and it didn't last a year before it started falling apart. I would not recommend you purchase one unless you only need to crush a few cans every now and than (like a few cans per month).
2,If you are careful,"This can crusher will serve you well until it bends. The metal that connects the handle to the crusher is made of very thin metal and once you put any side pushing on it or try multiple cans, it will bend the metal and make it just plain annoying to use."
2,Can Crusher,The Handle for the crusher is not padded very well and tends to get worst with use. The customer service at Farm & Home Supply Center though was very good. They sent a replacement out right away.
2,Flimsy,"Third pull, the handle arms bent. I've had one prior to this one, that was for 16oz cans, and it was also weak in a couple of other areas, but I welded them to make them more solid, and have had that one since 1995. This issue is different, and welding can't fix it. I've had to straighten out the flimsy handle arms a few times. They will eventually break from that, I'm sure, at which point I will disassemble the 12 and 16oz units, and combine their good parts to make another good/working unit. I pre-dent the sides of all my cans as well, prior to crushing, to make it easier on the unit. I won't be buying another one of these, for sure. Most people are probably used to buying and throwing away, rather than fixing, and that's just bad business, and bad for the environment."
5,Works as expected,"It's a can crusher and it does what it should. I haven't had it that long, so I can't testify to it's durability, but it seems like it would do fine under stress. If I were to formulate any complaints about this item, I suppose it would be that it doesn't crush taller cans, but I knew that before I even ordered. Also, the handle is made from a soft foam material, so I'm not sure how long that will hold up (from looking at the pictures, I thought it would be a harder rubber)."
5,wow,"its jazzy, its funky, its indie, its rock. soul coughing proved that they could get airplay and also be talented musicians and songwriters. while ""ruby vroom"" is often considered their best, you cant deny that ""irresistable bliss"" is an amazing piece of work, both catchy and well-crafted."
4,"extremely different, refreshing rock","It is hard to compare this band to any one out there, and that is a compliment. If you listen closely, there are myriad peculiar noises surrounding the powerful, driving bass and inventive percussion rhythms. It all blends into a hell of a crafty, catchy collection of tunes. I plan on listening to this a lot, lot more. ""Soundtrack to Mary"" is dynamite, and so is ""Disseminated"". The vocalist has a scratchy, handsome voice that fits the jaunty music well. A fine addition to anyone's cd collection."
2,Good album; but big letdown from Ruby Vroom,"Don't expect quite as much from Irresistable Bliss as you got out of Ruby Vroom. The album just never builds the ferocious momentum and artistic creativity of their first effort. Still, if you're a big fan of Soul Coughing, you'll need this one in your collection. But for myself, I felt that this album was mere photocopy of Ruby Vroom--a reproduction of faded quality."
3,Funky stuff,"I didn't become a fan until just a few years ago, but these guys were way ahead of their time. Mike Doughty is one of my most played artist and a good singer/songwriter. I wish I would have found these guys sooner."
2,"good service and price, but not so much the music",i bought this for one song that my buddy had put on a mix and the rest of the album is weak. oh well.
1,Soul Coughing - Not recommended,"I own a top stereo system and this was recommended as something to hear to enjoy and show it off. However, this all about sounds and not music. As a music lover, I do not see the pint in this CD. There is no music, no melodies. Now, others may hae a different perspective, but I enjoy melodies, music. I have varied taste and enjoy rock, jazz, pop, show tunes, classical and opera. However, simply a good recording does not do it for me. This is a purchase I wish I did not make. Thank you."
4,Good Peformance,"I purchased this mostly for the Repeghi ""Lauda Per La Nativita..."" ; the other copy I had of this piece was performed in English and I wanted one in the original old Italian. I am very pleased with the performance. The Saint-Saens was a welcome bonus."
3,All Reviews Written by Author and Friends,"Help! Can we get a real review here? 5 Stars by everyone and each happens to be in a major city geographically spread out across the country. New York, Dallas, Denver, Chicago, and Seattle. Hmm, where are the ones from San Diego and Miami? No specific details in any review, and each way too ""flowery"" and ""salesy"".Here is one from Binghamton, NY.""I just don't believe it. Too good to be true. I read every book and every book review as part of my job. It's my job to be cynical. I may actually review the book and provide real examples of meat or sewage rather than try to sell the book or Giese's seminar to you. Overall, the other reviews are good sales fluff absent of any benefits tied to direct examples."""
1,Why such a poor battery on such a great tool !,"I have had 3 of these batteries die in less than two years of moderate (weekly, not daily) use on my cordless drill. Two were replaced under warantee. I think it will be cheaper to buy a new Dewalt drill with batteries than to replace the batteries."
2,Doesn't hold a charge,"I tried to take care of the batteries for two years, by not leaving them in the charger for more than it took to charge them up, just charging them up when I used them, not over-discharging them. But they both stopped holding a charge after less than two years. When they're new the drill works great."
4,Recall,"I've had my Milwaukee 14.4 drill since '03 and finally both of the batteries died. I saw the advice from others about jump starting them, so I checked out the Milwaukee website, only to discover that 14.4 & 18 Volt NiCad batteries manufactured between 1999 and 2004 are being recalled and replaced for free due to an explosion risk. They say batteries manufactured after 2004 are safe. So if you are like me, check out the website and get some new batteries!"
3,A bit disappointed!,"No surprise! Perhaps I have high expectation before listening the songs, especially because it is collaborated with Sakamoto San and Sketch Show (YMO)."
5,Worked Beautifully in Europe,"I took this converter kit to London and Paris last month. It worked well on everything from cell phone chargers and camera battery rechargers to hair dryers and flat irons. It is in a fairly compact soft case so it was easy to pack. It works, what else can I say?"
4,worked great for me,"this product worked great for me when I traveled to Europe. I visited England, france, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. I figured out later that I probably could have just bought an adapter kit instead of a converter because I was mainly using small electronics (iPod, cell phone, camera) all of which were rated to handle 220 volts or higher. Nevertheless a great product. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is a little pricy."
5,back buddy shipping experience,I was expecting my order between Jan 17 thru 20th. It did not arrived until Jan23. The company has some paper issue and apologized. I recieved it on Mon plus a extra gift along with it. They later sent email apologized. they sent extra gift and and refunded 10% of my cost back to me. I happy with the service that the company realized their mistake and went extra mile to take care of it.Lu Francis
1,A Disappointment,This DVD was a disappointment mostly because it was not what I expected. I was looking for an exercise DVD with good dance music and dance movements so that the workout would be more fun. This DVD does not fill that bill. This is an instructional DVD for dance steps. You would use this DVD to teach yourself some moves so that you look better on a disco floor. But it is not a workout program per se. Whereas dancing can be great exercise this is not interesting and the workout is not more fun.The music is very dull. The dance steps are not really impressive. But if you follow the instructions you can look a lot better on the dance floor. I worked up a nice sweat but it was not what I was looking for.
2,Dance workout for Dummies,"This steps are still difficult, even for Dummies. Don't buy this expecting to learn classic dance steps this are very modern techniques. Not a good workout for me, I miss so many steps."
3,Preface & Author switched,"Just to let you know, Judson Cornwall did not write the book. The person listed as writing the preface did. In fact, there isn't a preface.The circumstances are unique enough to see God's hand at work. I have been convicted of self centeredness lately. I was collecting some more Judson Cornwall books to read, and thought this was his. I will read this book anyway."
1,Nothing special,"I was replacing the original plugs that came new with the vehicle. The old plugs were in for over 135,000 miles and were well past due to be replaced. My fuel mileage has been slowly getting worse and has dropped almost 5 mpg since the vehicle was new, so I was hopeful that putting new plugs in would increase the fuel mileage. After installing there was only a .5 mpg change in my fuel mileage. After checking with the E3 spark plug website, I found out that I was sold the wrong plugs for my vehicle. I was sold the same plug but in 1 heat range hotter than my vehicle should be using. The acceleration is sluggish and the vehicle has to kick out of overdrive just to get over minor inclines at highway speeds when it never would before. I can't say that I am happy with this product at all"
1,E 3 sparkplugs are the worst.,"Hi if you are consindering changing to this plug please dont they are junk, they caused missfire,blew out a plug boot and cost me $179.00 to find this problem. I contacted E3 they said it was not caused by their plug. I had AC delco plugs installed and have no problems. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY THEY STINK. The warrenty just covered the cost of the plugs I am out almost $200.00."
5,Noticeable improvement,"Put them in a 2007 camry 4 cylinder. Runs smoother, better pickup, great passing at higher speeds. Did a round trip from Va to NJ. Burned less gas and at half tank got more mileage than I have ever gotten. About 30 miles more at half tank. So about 2 gallons less on a trip per tank."
2,took longer to start up my Saab,Read the reviews and gave these a try. Worst than the old ones I have. Took longer to start up my Saab.
1,Lifespan - short,"Plug did what it was supposed to. With this means work like any normal spark plug. I am by no means supporting any of their claims of more mpg, more power and so on. Just bought it as a spark plug with long life span.But 100k??-No way!I have 30k on mine and I took one out to check the condition. The electrode is worn down, round and with an electrode gap just screaming ""Change me!""Condition of electrode looks very similar to any standard plug past due on changing interval.1 star because life span less than a third of advertised. I should have changed these out 10k ago by looking at them, which would give them 20% life span of advertised."
2,Disappointing,"For $35, I expected this to come ready to use, but the hole in the top was not drilled straight, so the hanger did not fit. Rather than redrilling the top (which might ruin this poly resin it's made of), I'll have to drill another hole in the bottom (made of wood) and it won't hang straight..."
1,I was disappointed,"I didn't know that there was such a thing as hummingbird houses which this item was called. I assumed that a hummingbird would actually nest in it. I bought it hoping to keep at least one of my little friends around past October. It didn't work, when the time came to fly they were all out of here. I gave it to a friend. At least it looks cute hanging from a small tree adjacent to his deck."
2,a rather tepid hodgepodge of weirdness..,"Since I love gothic novels I eagerly dove into 'American Gothic Tales', a large collection of gothic short stories. And with Joyce Carol Oates as the editor I thought for sure this book would be terrific. Well, it wasn't. Not even close.While it is hard to write a singular review of so many varied stories, let me say that hardly any of the stories were memorable. Worse, some of the stories were almost incomprehensible. As with other collections of short stories, I would have greatly appreciated some blurb by the editor in front of each story explaining its significance. Instead we have dozens of stories smashed together without interruption, with no real pattern to them.Bottom line: I found very few jewels in this otherwise dull collection of stories. Not recommended."
3,"good, but...","I have to admit, I'm a little negatively biased on this series, simply because the casting is awful. Not that Nathaniel Parker ánd Sharon Small are bad actors, just that they're not Lynley and Havers the way Elizabeth George wrote them. Certainly not physically and not really emotionally either. Still, the chemistry between Parker and Small is good and the stories are entertaining enough. The final episodes were a disappointment, however, because they were so very different from the book--and not near as creative. At least they got a better Helen half-way through the series!"
5,INSPECTOR LYNLEY,"GREAT WATCHING ON A RAINY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. GOOD STORIES, PLOTS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE"
3,"Shut up, Lynley","This season might as well have been subtitled 'Lynley: brooding and nasty'. For the most part, his character is completely unlikeable. Havers, again, carries the show. Though, again, she's not the Havers I'd have pictured from the book. With each series she gets prettier and far more likeable, and it's obvious she's the one with the real knack for investigation.The mysteries themselves are still wonderful, with good plots and decent twists that keep you guessing. Very much worth watching, especially if you can filter out a lot of Lynley."
2,You have to do all the work,"I really wanted to make pasta with this equipment, but it's kind of difficult. The best way I've found is to take the top off and turn the vegetable myself- that's kind of a pain!"
2,broken pin on the cutting blade,"While washing after using only about four or five times, the pin holding the cutting blade broke...done. Will not ever buy a product ffrom this company again."
2,Broke :-(,"The spiral slicer works fine. Unfortunately, the ""noodle"" slicer broke the first time I used it. I bought it specifically for the ""noodle"" slicer. I've had bad experiences with returns, so I kept it.The ribbon slicer blade works just fine. I've tried potatoes, zucchini, and thick carrots and it did a great job."
3,incomplete items,"Yes, I am missing the handle to rotate. I got everything else but the handle. I cannot tell how good it will work until I have a complete order. Please review and respond. Thank you."
1,Not good,"Not happy with this product. It doesn't cut good. Flimsy cheap plastic, will use it as an expensive salad bowl or some grain storage, not bad... :("
1,veggie julienne sillicer,"I only gave this a 1 star because Amazon is so great for returns. I bought 2, one for myself and the other as a gift as I felt confident in the reviews. Both of the ones I received were worthless. The gift one worked once, and that was all, mine never worked. The product deserves no stars at all. Amazon got the single star. and actually Amazon deserves 5 stars. :) Karen Campbell"
4,Same as the more expensive brand,"My friend purchased the more expensive 'Joyce Chen' version of this aparatus, spending $10-$12 dollars more than I paid for this one. I can't tell the difference between the two - except that the packaging for this one was printed in Japanese."
1,Not good for making zucchini pasta,I purchased this product to make zucchini pasta --- it did not work ... the product was cheap and in my opinion did not function properly ... but not sure if I'm expecting too much since it's a little over 10 dollars. I returned it.
4,Watch YouTube for Spiral cutter.,"So I get it in the mail and I'm EXCITED!!! Alas no instructions...thanks to youtube I found an instruction video for a spiral cutter. I'm excited for the prospect of enjoying ""pasta"" dishes. Tomorrow I'll add my ""angel hair"" zucchini with chicken and sauce and I can't wait!!"
3,Expected better,the slicer is smaller than expected and the vegetable keeps falling out of the grip when trying to use it. Overall I rate this a 3. If had a stronger grip the size wouldn't matter much.
2,Not very good,I was not pleased at all wit this product. It's not very stable. The blade piece constantly falls off. It's not a very good quality product to me at all.
1,Not worth it,I just noticed that I never reviewed this and now I guess I know why -- I didn't even remember having bought it until it showed up on items I hadn't reviewed. Now I remember why it was so forgetable -- it's a piece of junk. Save your money and buy a decent mandolin instead.
1,Use with Caution!,"I was initially quite pleased with this device. It created angel hair pasta out of raw vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, daikon, zucchini, and beets with relative ease. I used it about 10 times before I thankfully noticed that one of the tiny blades to julienne slice the vegetables had broken off and was missing! Having just made a giant salad of julienned vegetables, I quickly searched the bowl for the missing blade. I was relieved to find the triangular-shaped blade hiding in strands of zucchini. Although I really enjoyed using this slicer, I cannot recommend it to others. It may be inexpensive and functional, but the plastic and metal parts clearly do not stand up to regular use and the risk of swallowing a blade is too high."
4,love love love my julienne slicer!,"Works perfect for carrots and zucchini, can add heaps now to the salads and they all get eaten!! (unlike chopped or grated veggies which fall to the bottom). Makes beautiful angel hair ""pasta"" out of these veggies, wonderful to add into or on top of cooked pasta, really fun for party food. I have been missing out by not having one of these, and my daughter loves helping me use it too! Not as crazy about the wide strand option but it may be useful. Easy to clean, but metal bits need to be fully dried straight after washing, so I'm giving it a 4."
1,Dinner After Dark,"I purchased this book used. It was misrepresented as a publisher issue when, in fact, it is an uncorrected proof. Horrible. I have returned it and will not use this seller again."
2,Terrible zipper.,The bag is strong.Could be a little larger for the price.But im easy on my zippers.Mine unthreaded itself within 4 weeks use.
5,Handy as heck.,"This was a whimsy purchase, but turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I'm able to fit power tools in here, trash bags, cleaning supplies. The whole shebang in one bag. The bag itself is tough and has a good build quality."
5,A great Bag for small jobs,"I am able to fit my Drill, and Impact and also bits and lots more... it is great for small jobs."
3,the music sucks,"I've borrowed the second season of Tour of Duty from a friend. On the box it says in english ""Includes a new music soundtrak of popular songs from the Vietnam War era"". I doubt very seriously, that people during the 60's and 70's listened to synthetic instumentals, that barely even sound like the original songs they cover.Dont get me wrong I enjoy watching the show again, and I'll continue watching the rest of it. But, I refuse to but it untill they release copies with the originall music soundtrak. These copyright issues are ridiculous, and so is the greed from all these companies who own the music. I think those SOBs have more than enough money to spare to let us fans, who enjoyed the original shows with the original music, enjoy it again. The actuall music makes it seem alot more real to us so please bring it back."
2,Poor Quality,"I agree with a previous poster, the quality is pretty poor. Such a shame for one of the Best shows to hit the air waves in the 80's.As many have mentioned about the music, how would you like to watch Miami Vice (also one with great sound) with a completely different soundtrack ?The video portion needs some remastering ..... period !!!"
2,Wretched transfer,"Dunno if they were aiming for a crappy VHF/UHF reception-effect of the late 60s, but this DVD is pretty grainy. Not even indicative of bad digital compression, just a bad bad transfer. Had me wondering if they filmed the second season on video and left it on top of a refrigerator or something. Quality is VHS or poorer.Bottom line: Overpriced by 100% in terms of technical quality."
1,Even more disappointing than season one,"yes the music has been doctored again and the video transfer is much worse, very grainy for some reason. have barely made it through the first two hours so far. poor menus, episodes look thrown together. can't recommend this set, even though I loved the original series."
4,tod,i know what i brought is class the price was right its on dvd i brought season 1 in kuwaite at camp arifjan iam a british soldier .saw other 2 seasons on amazon brought them tour of duty is excellent .but i have not received them yet .
2,Where is the MUTT?,"I was very disappointed that all the MUTTs (1/4 ton M151 jeeps) we saw in season one were gone. M38A1 jeeps used in season 2 simply can't replace the MUTTs for the Viet Nam era, just like Hueys which are not replaceable. Compounded with original songs/music are replaced by very inappropriate and sometimes totally unfit cheap generic music, the grainy image, and the reversed cover photo, it's just a shame!"
4,A little hard to watch!,"I remembered these episodes as being very well done when they were originally run on TV, but they affect me in a different way now. The action scenes as well as the inter-squad interactions are pretty spot-on. I served with the 4th Infantry Division (1st tour) and the 25th Infantry Div. (2nd tour), 1966 - 1968. This is pretty much the time frame of this series, and close to the my AO. Except for some fairly trivial details, it's a good look at one aspect of the Vietnam War (police action? Yeah, right!)for anyone who wasn't there and a sobering reminder (as if we needed one) for those of us who were."
3,different,"I'll give them 3 stars for effort, but that's all all it would be for. please, some movies just don't need to be made."
3,Thorough without being overwhelming,"Best for those with a good grounding in Greek philosophy and little knowledge of Islamic. At times it gets lost in the minutiae of an argument, but overall a good overview."
4,The Boris Karloff Collection (5 movies),"Movies okay as horrors go. Have seen Karloff in much better roles, but he is good wherever. Still recommend. Love Karloff. Cecy Ivie"
4,"A Winner, But No Cigar.","This collection is for true fans of Boris Karloff only. As such,it is always a pleasure to watch this fine actor. All but NIGHT KEY are ""A"" pictures, and they have included Karloff's only Technicolorfilm from the 40s, THE CLIMAX, meant to be a follow-up to PHANTOMOF THE OPERA. Worth seeing, if only for the glorious Technicolor.Karloff is in some wonderful company in this collection: CharlesLaughton, Basil Rathbone, Vincent Price and Lon Chaney, Jr.The finest film is, unquestionably, TOWER OF LONDON, but you willhave a fun time seeing Karloff giving some very good performances,and putting the Frankenstein monster to rest for a while."
4,TITLES IN THIS COLLECTION,"Here are the titles within this collection. Just wish that St. Clair Vision would add them to their release information!""Snake People""""The Terror""""Dick Tracy Meets Grusome""""Island Monster""""The Ape""""Juggernaut""""The Fatal Hour""""Sabaka""""Mr. Wong in Chinatown""""Doomed to Die""""Mr. Wong, Detective"""
1,One Star for Ambiguity,"I haven't purchased this item, simply because nowhere in the product description is there any indication what movies are included. The same holds true for the Lugosi collection released by the same company. Give me some idea what I'd be spending my money on and I'll spend it!"
2,Repeats Old Work,"Ed Lee's ""Messenger"" is a repeat of old work. He hints at many aspects of his Infernal novels, but never really gets things going. True, there's the usual sex and gore, but nothing seems fresh or inventive. This is the same old demon/possession novel we've all read before. I like a lot of Lee's work, but this is definitely my least favorite."
2,"Dull, dull, and more dullness","This is one book I'll probably throw in my giveaway pile. The plot, such as it is, treats the tired old theme of demons taking over human beings to wreak bloody murder. The title is a sort of pun, since the demon in this novel utilizes postal employees as its ""messengers."" The title is about the best part of the book. The old Heaven and Hell stuff doesn't get my engines revving, especially when the action isn't particularly interesting. Sure, there's lots of gruesome slayings, but nothing I could sink my teeth into as far as plot and character development. Lee's writing is pretty standard: modern, utilitarian, to the point. Not exceptionally winning. If you want a lazy-day read you can plow through and throw out the next day, sure, go for it. Otherwise, take a pass on this one."
1,Juvenile and sloppy,"The combination of sex and violence presented here isn't anything new, and it fails to shock or disturb, clearly its intention. This is basically supermarket horror, made to be picked up off the rack on impulse. Just like an impromptu Twinkie purchase, this is easy to devour, but hardly satisfying, and certainly not good for you.In the edition I have, as well, the text sports one glaring error per chapter, something that certainly draws you out of the already wafer-thin plot. The responsibility for this sloppiness falls on the editor, to be sure, but it doesn't help matters any.If you're dying for a quick gore fix... still pass on this one."
2,"All gore, no story","Messenger has a very thin plot. A messenger of Satan is seducing postal workers in a small Florida town, getting them to graphically murder as many people as they can before killing themselves. It isn't so much a plot as a device for the author to write one violent, gory scene after another, all leading nowhere. I think he must have gotten paid by the number of times he wrote the word blood, bloody, blood-soaked, blood-covered, etc.This is a bad novel. Violence and gore are no problem if they are integral to the story but here, they are the story and nothing else. The dialog is so over the top it makes you laugh, the characters have no depth and no one behaves or reacts the way a real person would. The author bio says Lee has 15 novels in print. I hope they all aren't as useless as this one."
1,I burned this book,"I usually like the usual horror, gore, and even sometimes sex in a book, but this book was easily the worst book I've ever read. I bought this book thinking it would be like Anne Rice, written well, good plot, and maybe some gore thrown in; I was terribly mistaken. I only got about 140 pages into the book when I decided it wasn't getting any better. The plot was a little intriguing, the characters were decent, but the plot and characters got lost along the way when he started putting in sexual references, rather than sex, and disturbing images. Also, he didn't explain what was happening really well, and didn't focus much on the plot after a while, it just became more blurred. In conclusion, if you're not into the terribly written, half plotted, sex outweighing the gore novels...Do NOT get this book."
1,My messege...not this one.,I love Lee. I mean his stuff is just so much fun. When I finally gave him a chance and started reading his stuff I was hooked. Then I read Flesh Gothic and while good it just was not quite as good as the others I had read. I could not call what I felt disappointment but it was like a bump in the road. Then I read the Messenger. This is the worst I have read from Lee. It contained none of the fun of his other novels. Stay away from this one.
4,good book,this book was very useful for my project and helping me get ideas on a zen looking interior which was the feel i needed for the space i was designing. i would suggest this book to anyone who whats to acheive that look. it has alot of pictures to help you mind visulise the space and make your creative juices flow
2,Too Sterile,"This book was too sterile for me. It was done in the modern/minimalistic fashion that is so popular today. I like something that is beautiful, welcoming and comfortable . This book did not have any furniture that appeared to be anything you would want to sit on. Some of the rooms barely had any furniture in them."
3,Watchable,"As a fan of the Elizabeth George novels, I was impressed by the initial quality of the series. As the series moved beyond the novels, the plots became irritatingly predictable. George had the sense to expand the narrowness of a two character lead by adding four other central characters. We are left with Helen, interpreted as so neurotic that one wonders why anyone would spend more than ten minutes with her."
4,Thinking man's murder mystry.,The Inspector Lynley mysteries have a certain level of complexity that is not found elsewhere. Modern and realistic with a very real human side adds up to great entertainment.
3,"The Inspectorr Lynley Mysteries, Vol. 1 - 4","Considering that the stories on which this series was based were written by an American lady, the programmes are excellent. Both stars are well drawn; particularly Sharon Small, and the scenery alone makes the series worth watching.Agatha Christie it may be not, but an entertaining, beautifully filmed series it is."
4,Kids in Nature,"Kids always love this sort of nature book. I bought this book to give one of my great grand daughters. Start your kids offf young with this type of books. A nice book to take along , while traveling on the road with kids ."
3,Where Are the Farm Workers?,"My kindergarten students enjoyed this book, but I was upset that the author portrayed Annie harvesting an entire orchard all by herself. If you are writing a book for young children about where food comes from, you should acknowledge the contribution of migrant farm workers. They are invisible to most of us, and yet without the 1.3 million migrant workers, we would starve. I think they are too important to leave out of the story."
2,Not a scholarly book,"Livingstone writes like many journalists. He makes mistakes, and often makes sweeping conclusions with little or no support.One glaring error occurs on page 36. He states that the saddle was placed backward on Black Jack, the president's horse, in the funeral procession. I knew better, but found a photograph and confirmed that the saddle had been installed properly. The boots were backward in the stirrups, as is the custom. Mounting the saddle backward might have turned Black Jack into a bucking horse! This kind of error indicates to me that Livingstone is not a very careful researcher. It led me to read the rest of the book with little faith that Livingstone knew what he was writing about.I believe there is a lot of evidence that JFK's murder resulted from a conspiracy. However, Livingstone would not be a credible source for facts."
2,Not Much Here!1,"When I talked to his former partner, Groden, I was told that Livingtone is crazy. From reading this title, it appears so. He's in love with the Kennedys of Camelot and goes on into the wild blue yonder with this title.Too much B.S. and too much stuff that's hard to believe. What he calls evidence is just opinion... you'll see if you read it."
2,Gimee a Break!,"This author was in love with JFK it seems. He thought he was the greatest thing in the Presidency since slice bread. His book proves this, but little else. Even though he says he presents evidence, he presents nonsense and b.s.I suggest you watch cartoons. At least it's more entertaining."
4,Nice...,"The foot crusher vehicle is very true to the show. The mini Otto action figure fits nicely into it, but you have to position his arms, feet and tail just right.It's got a very cool green buzz-saw that comes out the front, that is very effective at ""cutting down"" the bad guys.It has two green missles that fit into launcher tubes on top, but they are not very durable. After a couple of weeks of normal use, it is somewhat difficult to lock them into place. It's not so hard that it kills the whole experience, though.The toy overall is fairly durable. The lid/top comes off so that it doesn't break if you over-extend it. Which happens often when you are playing with your five-year-old :)I highly recommend this toy. It was a huge hit Christmas morning."
5,Amazing book.,I bought this book used but it came in like it was new. There was some wear and tear but it looks new. I totally love this book the first time I read it. I plan to buy the whole series. :)
3,Required but disappointed,"Was a required text, but many other classmates found different atlases that much easier to use. We didn't follow dissection as listed in the text so it seemed pointless. Might be useful if implemented properly but it's now collecting dust."
5,The best atlas for a student's needs,"Clemente took the best of what other's have drawn, and has put them together in this incredibly useful atlas. Everyone harps about Netter's. I agree that it is a good atlas, but Netter labeled way too many structures on many pictures and lacks prose to help explain the pictures. Additionally, Clemente included charts that group everything you need to know about a muscle (origin, action...) at the end of each section. By the way, why does it matter that Netter's pictures are so beautiful?"
4,There are better atlases,"It is a helpful atlas, but it is not the best available. In my opinion one of the best atlas you can buy is Atlas of Human Anatomy by Frank H. Netter, M.D. The Clemente book is good because it gives descriptions on each plate, and there are tables that are very informative. However, the pictures are not always accurate and the labeling of structures is very limited. I bought the book with the CD-ROM and if I could I would give the CD about 2.5 stars. It is not worth the money. I was very dissapointed. If you want a more complete atlas, buy Netter(I would recommend the edition with the CD - it is very good)(Rohen-Color Atlas of Anatomy-is also VERY good). If you want a more introductory atlas for someone starting out in anatomy, Clemente will suffice."
3,SOUNDS like a rip-off,"I bought an original Parkway Records LP (US) when it came out. John Pearson, the leader amongst studio musicians, was a talented lounge pianist thrust into Beatlemania by Pye Record's chief in the early-to-mid 60s. Problem was, John was already well into his 40s (closer to 50), and would not, or could not, rise to the rigors of properly touring worldwide to support a new album. Ergo, Sounds Orchestral went away quietly.This album showcases Johnny's considerable skills, but prices over $20 would be dear. The $100+ makes it highway robbery."
3,Why did Assumpta have to die to exit the television series?,"I read the book after watching the entire series which went painfully downhill after Assumpta and Peter left the show. The quality of acting, scripts, and inspiration just slid slowly. I loved Peter's character and consider him a refreshingly complex and moral man in the world of growing darkness. Courage, honesty, selflessness-all are models needed in this culture. Peter was an antidote. I was one who signed a petition for the writer to write a sequel with a different way to deal with A and P."
5,"Great looking, clear sound quality",This phone is stylishly built and has a pleasant orange LCD display. The speaker phone quality is clear and the battery life of the cordless is long. Does not let you down in the middle of an important conversaton.
4,"Great toy, until...",This is a wonderful toy until your kids lose some of the letters. I've looked everywhere and can't seem to find where to buy additional letters for this game. HELP!
2,Not practical,It wasn't made clear enough that to get a reading from the gauge you have to pour very hot water on the gauge and propane tank. That isn't practical in alot of situations.
4,perils of virtual teams,"In case you are wondering, this book is no puff piece for Hewlett Packard, though all three authors hail from it. Instead, they present cogent explanations of why and how you might have a virtual team in your company. A common reason is to reduce expenses. As offshoring continues, it might make sense to have some members be from and in a country like India or China. Plus, having a project being worked on 24 hours a day can mean a quicker time to market. And that can be more important than the salary savings.The authors point out many practical problems that can arise when you try having a virtual team. All these might be resolvable. But that is by no means guaranteed. The book's suggestions do offer aid, that may be germane to your company."
4,Practical ideas based on real-world experience,"Like it or not, working in virtual teams or organizations is becoming increasingly common for knowledge workers throughout the global economy. This book offers ideas, examples, and practical techniques for making virtual work more productive and more enjoyable for everyone.It should be especially valuable for team leaders and managers who find themselves working increasingly, and perhaps somewhat reluctantly, with geographically distributed groups of people. The authors fill the book with practical examples from their own virtual work experiences. While recognizing the value of technological enablers, they also emphasize the critical importance of such intangible factors as building trust and operating within a supportive corporate culture."
4,"Something Old, Something New","The best rock & roll band you've never heard--unless you're from Boston, Lowell or you're lucky enough to have seen or heard them outside New England. Tippy, The Shods' final effort, combines Kevin Stevenson's usual affinity for '50's rock & roll, '60s garage and '70s punk rock into a melange of angry, soulful, frustrated, yet no-less-rockin', tunes. I hesitate to call it fun, because there's nary a cheerful lyric in the bunch (unless you count ""Go-Go Dancing""), but it's hard to resist tapping your feet, singing along and flipping off passersby. Kevin may not have anyone left to look up to (as he laments in ""Give Me One Person), but the rest of us have him."
4,Nice poetry,"It looks like I'm not as picky as the previous reviewer. All of these free poetry books are formatted as prose rather than verse, and I don't care if the book is complete or not.This is a very short book full of enjoyable poetry. A lot of the poems are about love and nature, and others are Meynell's musings on life, friendship, the future and more. I like the way she writes, but her style is hard to describe, so I'll just recommend that you start reading and see what you think."
4,Wire Wheel Wonder,"This works great for removing old paint off of iron railings. I would have given it 5 stars if the wheels lasted a little longer. Whenever I do a project, I buy more than 1 just to make sure I have one in reserve."
5,handymen,I needed to replace the inner tie rod on my 98 honda accord. I have a fairly well equiped shop but needed this specialty tool to do the job.This tool allowed me to remove the inner tie rod lock nut with ease. It has several difference sizes of fittings that allow it to be used on other vehicles.This tool paid for itself by me doing the job. It is well made and worth the price.
3,Solid,"Solid, serviceable tool and nothing more. No bells and whistles with this one. It's also easy to accidentally unlock the crowfoot while removing the tie rod. Overall a good value; will probably last for years."
5,Inner Tie Rod Tool!,"Worked perfectly as advertisied, a real time saver, great product, good pricing.Would highly recommend, for a mechanic or weekend mechanics. Will save you lots of bucks!"
4,Neat tool,This made the removal of my inner tie rods very easy. I have had issues in the past and wish I had this tool. I will use it only few times in my life but it was worth it.
5,Tool,"The inner tie rod tool worked just like it should have. I am very pleased to be able to add the tool to my collection, lol! Thx"
5,Has worked well every time.,"This is a very well made tool, I purchased this for my Bodyshop and have nothing but good reviews for this brand and seller."
4,Make sure you get the right kind of tool for your tie rods - round or flat,"This tool will work with inner tie rods that have wrench flats - i.e., flat spots on the socket portion for placing wrenches or this kind of tool. However, many vehicles (including my 2006 Nissan Sentra) have stock inner tie rods without wrench flats. The socket portion is completely round and smooth. For that matter, the replacement inner tie rods I ordered are also round and smooth. So check your tie rods before you order a tool for them! If you have round ones, you'll need a different tool, like theLisle 46600 Universal Inner Tie Rod WrenchorCal-Van Tools 946 Low Profile Inner Tie Rod Tool.I ended up not using this tool because I had round inner tie rods. However, from look at it, it seems fairly solid and would have made the job somewhat easier had I been able to use it. There was a small hole in the weld between the socket receptacle and the metal tube."
1,Not a precision tool,"Bought this to remove an inner tie rod on my wife's vehicle because it included the 1 1/2"" adapter I needed. Unfortunately the fit was so sloppy and my tie rod was so tight that this tool just slipped whenever I exerted enough force to loosen the tie rod. This tool was useless to me."
5,Great value - don't hesitate to buy!,"This was a great buy. The build quality of the tool is excellent - the Lisle tool is made in Clarinda, Iowa. The mechanism for retaining the sockets works very well, and the slots on the socket fit the tie rod snug - not too tight, not too loose. The tool accepts a 1/2"" socket drive. The only tool I found that was comparable in price was from Harbor Freight. The Lisle has no compromises in quality - this is a tool made for a full time mechanic at a very good price on amazon.com."
2,Just another tool,I bought one but could not use it znc had to return it. It requires another tool attached to the end of it to be used. Ordinary wrenches will do the same job.
4,One of the First!,"This recording was the first in its kind, to meld Rock with Symphony. It is a masterpiece and I was grateful to find it on CD, as my phono album got ruined. I've shared it with others and they love it as well. No one would ever think Symphony and Rock would ever marry, but Deep Purple proved otherwise, and collaborations have been made ever since. For Deep Purple or rock history enthusiasts, this is a must in every collection. Give it a chance if you ignored it... you will be quite surprised!"

5,Great value for the money,"I bought this to take it to the gym and I really like it. Its roomy for a pair of shoes, shirt, shorts and a pair of gloves. I also used this bag as a carry on and was able to pack enough cloths for 4 days!!!!!Overall a great value"
2,Sent it back,"Item that arrived did not include features such as the MP3 pouch pictured in the ad. It also had a defect on the back of it (small tear). Even without those problems I may have returned it. It's really a small bag, a bit too small in my opinion."
4,Too Small,I purchased this bag based on the review that a pair of gym shoes could fit in the end pocket. This may be true for a grade school child but not for my size 8 women's sneakers. The bag was a very high quality just much smaller than what I was looking for. I returned it the next day.
3,Smaller than described,"The published measurements are the same as the bag I am replacing. However, this duffel actually only measures 8.5x9.5x22 at its widest. Moreover, it tapers towards the top so the opening is hardly wide enough to let my sparring head gear in. Sorry to return it but all my gears and uniform don't comfortably fit in it. Appearance and quality looks great though."
3,size matters,"both towel and shoes pretty much fills the bag. no way to keep shoes, wet gear, and clothes separate. the water bottle holder is really minimal. but it fits the newer, slimmer gym lockers. but i do use it a few times a week, so it is adequate."
3,return problem,"The produce itself was ok but smaller than advertised. The problem came when I returned the product to J&R. They made you jump thru a lot of hoops...must have original package, must put it into another box that has no markings other than address, must pay for own postage and insure package etc. Got money back (less $11.00 postage) but it was a hassel."
3,"okay, not great","I got this 'on sale' to replace an older gym bag that had worn out. This is an okay bag just for hauling a few things to the gym, but not substantial enough for heavy travel such as airline carry on. This bag seems less roomy than similar items due to the longer but narrower shape. It is very light and feels a bit flimsy; it does not feel very substantial or tough. There is no 'shoe pocket', but there is a small end compartment and a side pocket. There is a permanently attached shoulder strap that is not detachable, which I do not like. Overall nothing special to recommend about this bag."
2,Just Okay,"I have no idea if the one I received in Nov '11 is an ""old"" or ""new"" version. I'd rate it 2.5 to make it right in the middle as average but gets only 2 since 3 would make it in above average (3/5) and that's not what I think. The shoulder strap has minimal adjustment range and will work better for very tall people - this I believe is opposite of the K. Chan review on the strap. The shoulder ""pad"" is unusable when the strap is cinched up some because it won't slide over the buckle in the strap. I'm 5'9"", not exactly short, and wanted it to hang closer to my hip/waist instead of lower thigh and the ""pad"" can't be used. There is a really thin and flexible flap covering the bottom for supposedly squaring it and adding support but very little. Bag should be okay as a simple duffle but isn't what I would consider super sturdy."
1,Buyers' Beware!,"This is my first ever review while I've bought probably over a hundred products on Amazon over the years. Usually I'm very pleased with the top suggested offer, so when I searched for a standard duffel bag to carry my gym clothes or take for weekend trips, I saw this High Sierra Bubba Duffel at the top of the list.Well I've had the bag for only about a week now and within that time, both of the two zippers to open the main section of the bag have become dislodged and I can no longer zip the bag. IT HAS NO USE TO ME AFTER ONLY A WEEK.I will contact the company as they claim to have a ""Lifetime Warranty""... glad my lifetime has been longer than ONE WEEK!"
3,"Decent size, but has issues","The shoulder strap is not detachable, and is quite bulky. Zippers were very stiff, and the bag material is somewhat ""loud"". You know when you drag your fingers across coated nylon, it sounds different than canvas or cotton or nylon of a different gauge? I don't like the feel or sound. Charcoal/Chipotle color was apparently discontinued by manufacturer (as told to me by the non-Amazon vendor that sent me the wrong color)"
2,WRONG COLOR,I did not recieve the right color for this bag.I was very sad because it was a gift for a close friend.
1,Great product... but wrong color,"Be wary of the bold, alluring Pepto pink color...I was sent a nasty pale pink my elementary studentswear on their Sunday School dresses."
2,"thin cheap material, not worth the price","I bought this item at Amazon and arrived as promised. The color is good, but the material is very thin and in the absence of padding or lining inside, need to be careful while packing or carrying fragile items. It has the picture of headphone on the side, but there is no hole for inserting the wire. Size smaller than expected, but it may not be seller's fault (not measured against the claim). Having used to good deals in Amazon, this is certainly expensive. Overall not value for money and will not buy again."
4,"Nice bag, perfect size","I use this bag just to hold my stuff to go back and forth to the gym and I really like it. You can fit at least one pair of shoes and a change of clothes in there, plus a small toiletry bag. The side compartment is nice too for ipods and such. The part that is supposed to hold wet items isn't really all that large-you couldn't put too much in there, but I just keep flip flops in there anyway. Overall the bag seems quite durable and has held up well. Fits perfectly in a small gym locker."
2,too small,"love the construction, but way too small and not enough pockets. The pockets are to small also. Will have to buy a bigger bag."
4,A good gym bag,"This works for me as a gym bag. It's a bit on the small side - I can fit my clothes and two pairs of shoes comfortably in there, but once that's in, there's not much room left, for example I can't fit a basketball ball in addition to that.It also has waterproof (from inside) side pocket for wet trunks. Finally, it has big pocket for keys/locks/wallet etc.Good value overall, nothing fancy but quite practical."
3,"It works, but not quite perfect.","I'm 5'2, while the strap and shoulder pad of this bag is probably built for someone around 5'7, so I don't get the benefit of the pad after the strap is adjusted.Wish there are more compartments, which would really help sort out all the things in the relatively big bag. There's a main compartment, a side compartment, a small pocket on the side of the main compartment, and a small mesh pocket that would probably fit a small water bottle (not my 32-oz Nalgene).The bag size probably work better for a weekend getaway; can be 25% smaller for gym after work.The bag seems pretty sturdy so far, and it comes with lifetime warranty (which I'd rather not have to use). It's a good bag, just isn't perfect for what I have in mind."
4,I recommend this bag,"I really like this garment bag. It holds more clothing than I would have imagined. , I would have given it 4 stars. I am very happy with the amount of clothes I can carry on my trips which last at least a week and at times more...I recommend this bag..."
5,A chilling post-war masterpiece,"Through Robert Faehmel,the subject of Boell's stark description of life in post-war Germany, the modern reader can truly feel the same sense of unsettlement and social insight. Boell depicts a society where former Nazis, barely unfit to be tried at Nurenberg, now rule over Germany's biggest cities as mayors and serve in the modern beaureacracy. Faehmel is a man who can not survive here without his own rigid regime and almost stereotypic German precision in order to escape his fate in the present and his decisions and losses in the past. In ""Billiards at Half-Past Nine,"" brought to the Engish reader by Pulitzer Prize winning translator, Leila Vennewitz, Heinrich Boell, Germany's conscience and master story teller, presents perhaps his greatest work."
4,War Wounds,"1958, and Germany undergoes political, social and economic reformation.Robert Faehmel looks back over the period of two world wars enabling Boll to explore themes of identity and what fashions identity.German culture led to aggressive militiarism-how to replace it or make it translate into something different;the past isn't easy to erase. Also, the people doing the rebuilding are all in some way linked to this past.The story perhaps is a little allegorical for some tastes, and this dates the book as Germany and the world has moved on 50 years. Still, its an expertly crafted novel by a Nobel prize winner."
5,Finders Keepers CD,Just received this cd. It took me back to my teenage years. Love it and would buy from Moviemars agaij!
4,"it's the best one i encountered, but not awesome","i looked through a couple other pregnancy belly dance dvds before getting this one, and this one was the least, um, awkward. some had technical problems, like bad voice synching; in another, the movements were too advanced; in a third, the woman was barely dressed and looked like she was enjoying herself a little too much, if you catch my drift. sera solstice is very calm, and professional, and accessible--so don't let the urban primitive/goth costumes throw you off.that being said, i think it was a little too easy, and didn't do really a great job of stretching/working out my hips and lower back. i would have liked more hip moves, to work out the pain and stiffness i have in those areas."
5,Attacks on the First Amendment: The Details,"This is an excellent detailed summary of many of the ways that governments (local and national) have curtailed the protections of protestors and the public under the First Amendment, particularly since 9-11. Pre-protest media hyperscaring about anarchists, attempts to deny permits, police intimidation at protests, mass arrests, unreasonable bonds, and national data bases of protestors are all covered. The National Lawyers Guild, which has helped fight many of the battles described in the book, has done a great service by publishing this report."
2,Fitness Knows No Holidays,"Keep an eye out for McGladerey's follow up book titled ""Gay Bar Hopping Knows No Holidays""."
3,"new, kinda disappointed","I ordered this book new, although it was wrapped in plastic the corners and pages look roughed up. It arrived in plenty of time with my late ordering, rushing to head back to school."
4,The Alex Rider Collection,I bought this for my grandson. He is a sheltered 11 years old and has enjoyed the Alex Rider series very much. ...anything to get them off the computer and into a book!
4,good action read for boys,My son is 12 and really enjoyed this book. He likes action and intelligent characters and this has both.
2,missing pages,Very disappointed to find that when my son got to the end of the third book that the last chapter plus a few pages were missing.Publishers should have discovered this and sent corrected versions by now I believe
5,Alex Rider Box Set - great for teens!,"My son doesn't enjoy reading many books, but needs to for independent reading assignments at school. He enjoys watching James Bond films with me, but the Young Bond series was too difficult for him to read. One of my friends told me how good the Alex Rider series was and that her nephew devoured them, so I wanted to give them a try.This seller was excellent - the books were new and still sealed, delivery was very prompt."
4,Alex Rider collection,These were purchased for an 11-year-old grand daughter. The books arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition... and her nose was in the books from Christmas day until the last cover was closed.
5,Love this series!!!,"Full of action and adventure sure to keep kids turning the pages. Great plots and cool characters really make these books bestsellers! Recommended for ""James Bond"" fans."
5,Alex Rider Series,The books were priced very affordably and arrived just when Amazon said they would. My son has been reading like crazy! Thank you Amazon!
3,Constant editorial mistakes,I liked this book well enough although Im not so sure my child can handle the level just yet like I was hoping he could. I saw many an editorial mistake made in these books. In fact on page 3 of the very first book it jumps a page ahead in the narrative and leaves a child completely confused before they can even become attached to it. Very disappointing.
4,Uncut noise-core pumps your adrenaline,"The Dutch self-claimed ""Noise-Core"" formation Hanniball blasted the East-European noise scene with their fresh mix of influences. The four band members (Peter, Bert, Pascal and Marco) elevate live experience with their smashing songs and memorisable lyrics. While ""Uncut Supersnuff"" is their first and debut album, it received high credits by respectible magazines such as Oor, Aardschok, DCLXVI etc. When you listen to this album and hear the first song, ""Torpedo"", you'll understand that there ain't now way to sit still and relax."
4,"Not the artistical achievment of the universe, but fun.","It's about a impulsive kid who's parents make him dress in a girl's uniform so he can go to a girl's school. An evil siamese cat owning headmistress wants his necklace which I think is magic for some reason, so she puts a price on his head and interesting clubs attack him. His parents are really dysfunctional and also are violent. It was fun and had an interesting plot and I think it had caricatures of goofy baseball playing americans, but it didn't explain the plot enough."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"It worked great the first year, everyone camping loved the hot shower. BUT, it quit working due to the rechargable batter not charging. I called Coleman, No Customer Service I can tell ya. I purchased a new battery from them, and it still wouldn't work. When I called the second time, I got the run around about who to call. Finally found the right person, and was told I would have to pay to ship it back to them to ""take a look"" at it. Repairs would cost additional to the shipping to Coleman and back to me. Heck, by the time you pay for all this.....you can purchase a BETTER product without all the hassle and no customer service from Coleman!"
5,Extreme Family Camping Mama!!,"Love Love Love this product!!!! Easy to assemble, Hot water ready in just minutes and Love the Hose/shower adapter! This product is so simple that a very busy mom can get it up and running in just minutes, give her kids a shower, and wash dishes all on the same battery charge. I did end up going back and purchasing the propane adapter for the 20 gallon propane tank, because the little portable ones just didn't last long enough for our family of 6. If you love camping and need hot water this is a must for you!!"
4,Works great once you get the leaks out,"I had a lot of trouble getting the hose adapter to stop imitating a garden sprayer. I took the brass fitting off, put some teflon tape on the threads, re-installed it and added another hose washer, now it works much better. Coleman needs a licensed plumber on their design staff. The heater will not start while the battery is being charged, Coleman's rechargeable lanterns display this similar design flaw."
2,Poor Build Quality,"Bought this when it was on at half price. Even then ended up returning it. The build quality is not of a very high standard. Out of the box we had many issues with leaks. Then the front control dial would only work at a couple of positions, so the product out of the box was not usable. Due to the obvious poor build quality rather than just return it for a replacement I could see that even if you get a fully functioning one, it may last you just long enough that you'll have a faulty unit after your warranty is up, not to mention the coast and hassle of dealing with warranty anyway, and believe me at some point wou will need to do so if you aquire this."
3,Cheap for the money.,For just a little more you can get a better unit with more features. I have an Aqua Cube and it was just a little more and make the Coleman look like a cheap child's toy. Yes it works...and yes it heats water...but shop around and look before you buy.
1,hot water but difficult to rig at first,The hot water on demand only worked after you fixed some of the hose fittings. In fact the hose adapter broke and we then put in a brass replacement with Teflon tape and silicon caulking. OK but then the limit on the shower hose meant you had to put the unit up on a box to take a shower. Great idea that needs some improvement to be practical for any but the most hard core camper.
2,GREAT -- WHEN IT DOES NOT BREAK,"I have had two of these units. Within a year, both units broke in the very same way. The battery charges but the unit behaves as if the battery is dead. I have confirmed the battery, and my spare battery, are both charged fine. It is great when it works.So, I highly recommend you also buy a solar water shower as a backup because this unit is NOT dependable. This weekend our solar water shower backup saved us! Coleman products have really deteriorated in quality over the years. It is sad."
1,Bad product,"In 3 weeks I exchanged 3 of those coolers. First died in 2 weeks (cooling system leak), 2nd was non-working unit from the box, 3rd wend down in 3 days (cooling system leak). I bough this wine cooler from Fortunoff and now I'm sending this one back for refund.Hair customer service may take you a week to setup service appointment and about a month to exchange the product - very slow service for junk wine cooler."
2,Noisy Wine Cooler,"Good looking, dual-zone system chills to proper temperatures, but this is noisiest and gurgling refrigeration system I've heard. Tried restarting, still the noise continues. When the system is at temp, quiet."
5,OPINION,"I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT, THE MOST ATRACTIVE THING IS THE PRICE, HERE IN MEXICO IT'S DIFICULT TO FIND A 40 BOTTLE COOLER FOR THAT PRICE. THE DELIVERY SERVICE WAS PERFECT."
2,Too small,Good material. Way smaller than I expected and lid does not secure well so it falls off everytime you touch it. Will have to make a few more trips downstairs...
3,"Way smaller than I expected, but a good little bin","I use mine for can recycling. The opening is a good size for that, but nothing much larger. Good price."
2,Fun toy,I got this for my grandsons. They had a lot of fun playing with this but they are not durable at all. I think they need to make them either cheaper or more durable. Consider it a throw away toy. It is fun while it lasts though.
1,NO FUN,THE GAME SUCKS THARE IS NO GOOD WEAPONS UNFUNNY JOKES BAD GRAPHICS AND STUPIED BAD GUYS DONT BUY GET SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG
4,Highly useful tool,"The tiller made quick work of expanded garden. Beats the heck out of spade, pitchfork and the rake. Could use it early in the morning the electric power didn't offend neighbors."
1,Too hard to put together,"Right now I am very unhappy with the Tiller. I'm a female and live alone. Yesterday with the help of my sister, we tried and tried to get this thing put together (I just got it off Amazon). It is just too complicated. We worked for at least a couple of hours on it. Right now it is sitting in pieces in a box. It might work just fine if you could get it put together, but I may never ever know. I'm just hoping the next time a man comes over he can put it together for me. My advice for women would be not to buy this unless you have put things like this together before or if you have a husband or male friend that could put it together for you. I will never buy anything disassembled again on line."
5,Buy one if you can afford it!,"I've had my electric Mantis tiller since last Spring. I'ts my favorite lawn and garden tool! They are so darn convenient! No mixing gas and oil. Just plug them in and till. They till up a storm once you learn that they do their best work being pulled backward...which you will learn if you read the instructions. They are light and easy to carry and to maintain.I have used tillers for over 50 years....my Dad hitched me to the first one when I was 15, and we had a half-acre vegetable garden. This small tiller is perfect for my flower beds and tomato patch, and it tills beautifully. Neighbors borrow mine, friends borrow it, and I take it with me when I'm going to help friends and relatives. Can't say I ever spent 300 bucks better!"
4,Love My Electric Mantis,"After ordering the Mantis Electric Tiller, I was a bit skeptical about using an extension cord to till. However, I really love the Mantis tiller. It starts in a breeze, it is easy to take off the tines and clean them.Naturally, you would not want to use this little tiller on previously untilled ground. And yes... it does bounce a lot, because it is so light and my ground even tho tilled is very rocky.However, I deal with this and really enjoy my Mantis Elec.I have had another tiller before that starts with a T and ends with a Y and really was quite put off by it.Get a Mantis, you'll love it!!!"
4,small garden tiller,The mantis does very well for what it is intended. It's a lightweight tiller and is excellent for small gardens. I have a small lot in an urban setting and I could use this tiller at 4 o'clock in the morning and my neighbors wouldn't know it. The electric motor is that quiet.Don't expect it to till a field the size of a commercial garden it's too small and would take you forever.
2,smoking mantis tiller,"I purchased a Mantis Electric Tiller from an online company for use in the raised beds in my greenhouse. The tiller arrived a few days later, assembled easily in lesss than twenty minutes, and performed surprisingly well . . . over a peroid of four days for a grand total of about four hours. Then the reset button began tripping repeatedly, followed shortly thereafter by the tiller's outright refusal to operate at all. As if to emphasize its refusal to work, the tiller then began issuing acrid smoke from the housing. Have yet to be able to locate the company who sold it to me, and have yet to speak to Mantis directly. I am hoping the manufacturer of the Mantis Electric Tiller will step up and replace their product as well as take measures to improve it."
1,Cheaply made,"I ordered this from amazon as I do purchase frequently and usually have good results. Not so with this item. It was used once, maybe twice, when it stopped working: the needle wouldn't move off of 140F. With some experimenting, I found that when the probe was twisted, the needle would move proportionately. Somehow I don't think that's supposed to work in that fashion.There are other compost thermometers out there; I think amazon may want to consider carrying the REOTemp brand insted of this."
4,Works good but priced a bit to high.,"Bought this a few months ago because my compost pile was steaming and I wanted to know the temp.When it 1st arrived, I felt it was built cheaply. Then again, most things these days aren't built like they once were. But it's held up well.It's been in my pile since day one and there's not a sign of rust or moister in the gauge.So far so good, but I still feel it's over priced for a thermometer."
1,Good while it lasted,"This temperature probe only lasted me about two weeks. I stuck it into my compost pile about 10"" and when I tried to pull it out, the head of the unit popped off. I wouldn't say that I was pulling hard, I think it was a spot weld or just some friction holding it on, not very securely. Anyhow, I tried to put it back on but the unit would no longer show temperature changes."
2,Broke,Unfortunately mine broke fairly quickly. The needle stopped measuring (it was stuck to the axle).Next time I get a product half the price if it's going to be disposable.
3,"Overpriced, but the only one I know of for this purpose","It's just a long thermometer that should be priced at $10-15. So far it seems reliable. I bought the Mantis composter and really feel it was over priced too, but I wanted twin bins that spin and were off the ground."
4,So far solid compost thermometer,"I read all the reviews before buying this product, and saw a lot of complaints about the sturdiness of the thermometer. I've been using it for 4 weeks, and haven't had any troubles. I don't leave the thermometer in the compost pile though. I just bring it outside and insert it into the pile when I want to know how the temp is doing. I try not to pull the thermometer out by the dial part, although sometimes I do. The thermometer changes quick, just a matter of seconds and it reads 140 from 80. The thermometer is fairly accurate, but I've only compared it to my home's thermostat.I would have given this product 5 stars, but like some others, my thermometer came in a lightly crushed box. No damage to the product. And amazon put that box into a much better, bigger amazon box. So the shipment was very secure, but sometime before that the other smaller slender box got messed up.Overall, great thermometer that's quick and accurate for the price."
2,flimsy,The item was not packed well..no instructions in the box...and it seemed flimsy. I am still not sure if it is working.
3,works but is flimsy,This worked for a while and was accurate in its readings when compared to my other one (Reotemp)but the head just broke off the shaft. I will probably replace with the reotemp which seems a bit stronger.
4,It measures temperature.,"This thermometer measures temperature, which is to say that it displays a reading of the thermal activity contained within the object into which one inserts it. It's flimsy, sure, but it's also long.I give it four stars only because it would have been nice if it were powder coated in rainbow colors."
1,What a waste of ink,"Okay, so there's this really evil robot named Ultron who wants to destroy the human race - basic comic book stuff. Brightly colored costumed heroes then rush in to save the day; everything good so far.What could have been a jolly good, silly superhero adventure is given as much thought as a car with five wheels. Pointless action which only serves to take up room mires page after page. Plus, the evil robot wipes out an entire nation of millions of people - a needlessly misanthropic plot device used merely to illustrate just have naughty the evil robot villain can be. What would amount to one to the greatest mass-murders in history is thrown away in four panels!This is the Avengers at their very worse writting."
4,Wonderful tearjerker!,"I was very lucky to get an advanced reading copy of this book. OMG, I felt everything that Samantha was feeling. Samantha is working through her own feelings of self-worthlessness when she returns home. The seven years that she has been gone, after running away with her high school sweetheart, have not been kind to Sam. She has lived on the edge, while trying to be a good mother to her son. She returns home, wondering if she will be accepted, and also her beautiful son, the result of a one-night stand with a man of a different race. Not only is she and her son accepted by her family, they are also cherished. However, it seems that the acceptence that Sam is seeking, comes not from her family, but from within herself. I found this to be a beautiful story of discovery and cried throughout most of the book. The emotions brought forward by this author are real and it was another book that I couldn't go to sleep without finishing."
5,Handel: Messiah,Handel: MessiahOne of the greatest pieces of music ever written (personal opinion - however I think most would agree) and performed by two of the great orchestras and choirs. The Philadelphia Orchestra and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir provide one of the greatest combinations for a fantastic rendition of Handel's classic. Highly recommended for the Christmas Season or just the pleasure of good music any time of the year.
5,I khow that my Redeemer liveth!,"I khow that my Redeemer liveth! (Yo sé que mi Redentor vive!), Qué hermosa versión de Ormandy del Mesías de Handel, el trabajo del coro del Tabernáculo de los Mormones (Mormon Tabernacle Choir), es simplemente EXTRAORDINARIO, el concepto de Ormandy muy vivo! Yo sé que existen muchas otras versiones de gran calidad, pero esta es realmente hermosa hace que nos sintamos tan cerca de Dios (Our Lord), con un sentimiento de alegría de ser hijos de Dios. Gran versión! Al finalizar la obra da ganas de gritar ¡VIVA HANDEL!"
5,"""The Standard""","This production has been THE proven standard [ from a non-professionals' stand point]. This cd replaces my worn out tape of the same production from about 1981. Unless one knows of a better production out there, one could not go wrong by procuring this item!"
4,"A Good ""Starter"" Messiah","I suspect many Americans learned the music of Messiah when this was first released something like 40 years ago. Yes, its missing about half of the music, and yes, it isn't played on period instruments or orchestration and is missing most of even the most standard Baroque ornamentation, but it nevertheless sounds wonderful and in ways more robust than some of the more urtext performances available. And Eileen Farrell simply sings rings around almost all of the more accurate but comparatively bloodless soprano competition. The other soloists are fine, and the chorus and orchestra are energetic."
2,Ugh,"Like many others here, this recording was my first exposure to Handel's Messiah. I thought it was rather strange for a Baroque piece, but kept listening to it to resurrect the Christmas cheer every year.Then I listened toJohn Eliot Gardiner's rendition, and I finally understood what I was missing.Unlike Gardiner's version, this version lacks the lightness of step and vigor of Handel. Instead, it's a muddy, leaden, over-dramatic mess. The microphones seem to be set quite a ways from a HUGE choir and orchestra, creating a foggy, booming atmosphere.From other reviews here, it sounds like many people like this simply because of fond memories from their childhood. If you don't have those memories and know even a little bit about classical music, DON'T get this version. Get a version that actually treats it like the Baroque masterpiece that it is."
4,Change of pace,"This is the first recording I had of Messiah and the basis for all other versions I heard since then. I now own recordings by the Robert Shaw Chorale (my favorite), the Atlanta Symphony with Shaw (my next favorite), Neville Marriner, the BBC Philharmonic with Harry Christophers doing Mozart's arrangement, and the huge Sir Thomas Beecham recording. Most of the newer recordings seem to use the faster Baroque tempi, which is fine, but, after hearing so many of them, I really enjoy some of the older recordings using slower, more Romantic tempi like Beecham's and Ormandy's.David Cunningham's voice has a bit of an edge on it, and he is my least favorite tenor in these recordings. I think William Warfield is in the same class as Giorgio Tozzi with Beecham, and Thomas Paul and Richard Stillwell with Shaw. He is lyrical and handles the faster passages nicely.I would not suggest this recording over the Shaw ones, but it is nice to go back to the bigger sound and slower paces once in a while."
2,Caveat Emptor,"This is one of those times when the reviewer really needs to note ""buyer beware."" The titles collected here are pretty much Grade Z (or sometimes slightly above) teen comedies of the 70s and early 80s, but the quality of the product itself is problematic. For example, THE POM POM GIRLS looks like it was transferred directly from an old VHS copy, and MY CHAUFFEUR is missing one entire scene (the walk through the desert), with no explanation. On the plus side, many of the faces here are familiar--Sam Jones, Robert Carradine, Deborah Foreman, Penn & Teller--so if you need to waste an hour and a half some night, pop in one of these."
4,Great Collection of teenage fodder.,"When I purchased this set, I was looking at the titles ""My Tutor"", ""Tomboy"", and ""My Chauffer"" which were sorta popular in the early 80's. These titles alone made the price reasonable on this package. The film ""Jocks"" was great for a first screeening; however, there are two films on this package that just plain suck. ""Pom-Pom Girls"" and ""The Van"" may have their place in 70's icon fodder, but they suck on this set of films. Wished this set contained a few more USA Up All Night standards such as ""H.O.T.S."", ""Hollywood Hot Tubs"".......however it does not. A great find if you are a fan of classic teenage B-Movies.The 8 movies on this set are...(7.5) My Tutor(6.0) My Chauffeur(???) Hunk(6.0) Tomboy(7.5) Jocks(???) Weekend Pass(3.0) The Pom Pom Girls(2.1) The Van"
2,Not a Very Thrilling Book!,"I really didn't find this book to be that scary or thrilling. Sure, there was some suspense in it, but the ending just took a lot of it out. If you want to read a scary, thrilling, or suspenseful book, read something by R.L. Stine!"
4,Like it,"Well worth it. Fits nicely in the drawer and has a lot of space. Don't buy the cheap ones at Wal-Mart, get this bad boy!"
5,Works perfect at work...,Great organizer... not hard plastic... it has a little give to the plastic... it should never break... I love this product... and great price...
2,"Loved this product, but...","This desk tray is great. It is deep enough to keep stuff from falling out, fits PERFECTLY in the top of my file cabinet (in the drawer), and is sturdy. I fit a good amount of stuff in it, keep my paper clips and staples organized. There's a compartment which is long enough to hold a stapler and ruler, which is pretty awesome.BUT this product is available at Walmart for the same price, and only $1 shipping, instead of the $25 dollar 'free' shipping that comes with this product. The experience in getting my money back has been horrible, and it cost me 2.5x what I expected to pay."
3,10 cent piece of plastic,"How they get away with charging eleven bucks for this is beyond me -- it's literally just a big piece of plastic. I guess they're allowed to set the price if people like me keep buying it, though ...As for the product itself ... it divides. Yep. It does the job."
5,"Good, Sturdy Tray",Fits perfectly into my average sized desk drawer and holds everything I need close at hand. Definitely not made of flimsy plastic - it's a good solid product.
5,Perfect for my cabinet drawer,This fits my cabinet drawer perfectly. It helped me organized bunch of things and keep things tidy. It was a great purchase.
3,"Like they said, measure first!","This tray is of good quality with deep storage. I read one review recommending to measure first, and I did- but i only considered the depth and width. The tray was appallingly an inch longer than my drawer, so I eventually placed it somewhere else unplanned. Would have been five stars for quality, but the delivery took a week and it came in a box 10x its size (no joke). I had to dig in among the airfilled cushion bags and find the tray sitting at the bottom."
4,Full of vitality,"""I Fiati Italiani proved to be accomplished instrumentalists in their own right as well as blending sympathetically with each other. This was especially evident when the sublime and imaginary sound of the Mozart Quintet K452 emerged in its full glory in the sonorous Introduction and larghetto. The wind were elegantly played and given firm support from the piano."
5,good stuff,Love to see this product in a 4 ounce version too. This stuff works for me every day. I enjoy the results
4,visually stimulating,Compared to the others the production value is the best. The look of this film is unique. Vibrant colors and costumes take you on a visual journey. Lets face it this is a karate movie. I doubt any of the fighters fought on broadway but the cast of charactors that surround Bernhardt make him watchable. I figure the lack of fight scenes is due to the budget so give it a chance and stop complaining. The guy who plays Doc Rosembloom is hysterical!
1,"Terrible fighting sequences, but plot makes it up (ha!)","Every once in a while, a movie comes along that redefines its genre. These works set new standards for greatness and, as high-water marks of their respective fields, do the industry service by raising the bar of expectations. I'll let you know if they finally got it right when Bloodsport 5 comes out. A spectacular abomination, Bloodsport 4 shows us that no amount of ""experience"" in front of the camera is ever going to make Daniel Bernhardt believable. Watching him plug through his lines with that laughable accent makes one harken back to the earlier days of the series (say, for example Bloodsport I) when the films were actually good enough to be released onto the big screen. Now, they're all directly ported onto video to make a buck off of fans of ultraviolence. Give it up, Bernhardt - stick with something of quality, like Mortal Kombat - the Series........"
1,I feel guilty giving this movie One Star,"This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. To call the acting bad is an understatement, The lines in this movie are so pathetic it makes watching painfull. [....]The Fight seens are terrible, if not down right boring and on top of all this the sound on the DVD doesn't quite sync with the movie, I guess the movie wasn't worth the extra effort to get it right.It really doesn't deserve a whole star."
2,LET ME BORROW YOUR PEN,"The frivolous use of writing instruments is the only original idea in this tired kung fooey saga. Although physically imposing, Daniel Bernhardt's acting range is that of a rutabaga, and even though the fight scenes are reasonably well choreographed, they are not enough to overcome the basic lucidcrous plot. The other actors in the film are lifeless and dull; the movie's thin plot has been done in hundreds of karate classics, so there's little to recommend this film; I give two stars for its sheer existence."
3,Works OK - barely...,"I bought this to trim some 1/4"" plywood from underneath a cabinet (couldn't get a chisel in there) and it worked just OK. To cut about a 1 foot section took about 10 minutes with a ton of burning and smoking of the blade and grinding to a halt (absolutely no torque) when met with a bit of resistance. It might work ok for balsa wood, but for anything else it is too weak a blade (carbide tipped would be better). Also, the blade guard is annoying because you can't get flush up to your edge (leaves about 1/8"" or so of wood still along the joint). It's also annoying how you have to change out the head unit of your dremel, making it time consuming to switch back to normal collet and bits."
2,It is practically useless,"It's like a toy saw, the construction quality of the housing is good and sometimes it does work quite well. But the tooth of the saw itself went curved with 2 hours of use, and the dremel tool doesn't have enough torque to work except on the easiest surfaces, maybe balsa or very thin wood.A big deception."
3,Works great for small jobs! Could use some improvements.,Fine for cutting thin wood or plastic. I wish it cut deeper - say up to 1/2 inch. Also wish there was a way to manually move the blade protector out of the way while cutting.
1,Utter garbage,"I originally bought this attachment to use in helping my son build his Pinewood derby car for Cub Scouts. This is a great tool so long as:1) You don't need to cut more than, say, 3/4ths of an inch in length. Forget getting anything longer in anything like a straight line. You can't see where you're cutting, the grip is awkward, and it moves all over the place.2) You don't need to cut anything more than 1/8th of an inch thick. Even then, expect the ultra-thin blade to bind like crazy.3) You don't need to cut anything hard. Thin plywood? Pegboard? A dowel? Hard plastic? Don't even think about it. It might cut (partially) through some nice Chinese drywall or wet cardboard. Provided it doesn't bind first.In short, I can't see a use for this attachment after trying and failing to use it in several different projects. Maybe you'll have better luck, but you should definitely think twice before purchasing it."
1,Poor quality.,It works fine but it rattles like it is going to fall apart. Very poor construction built like dremel has abought 2 dollars in construction. All plastic except for center shaft. They should charge a price closer to the quality of product abought $5.00 Here is to a vibrating piece of junk.
3,Good Attachment - Blade Guard spring is too Strong,"As expected from Dremel, this is a high quality attachment. The issue is that the spring on the blade guard is too strong. I make small models and I intended to use the saw for precision cuts. However, it takes a good amount of force to depress the blade guard when feeding into the wood. Because of the need to ""manhandle"" the tool, any amount of precision is lost. In other words, it's impossible to make a precise, straight cut. It works properly, but does not meet the needs for which I purchased it."
2,Not What it Seems,"As a tinkerer I have a mini workshop set in my apartment composed mainly of Dremel brand tools and for a long time I'd thought the Mini Saw would prove a sound investment when it came to making cut-to-size needs easier to deal with (I have MS so having a reliable tool of this type is practical as well as necessary). Unfortunately the mini-saw barely scores most of the rather thin wood pieces I work with (roughly 3/8"") and too, it easily gets bogged down and thus, unable to operate properly. . . my antique ""toy"" circular saw (Mighty Might Tools -- mid-1970's) is nearly as good as this device and it only cuts balsa & Styrofoam.I'm seriously disappointed and it has made me more hesitant when it comes to purchasing other Dremel attachments."
4,Only works with certain Dremel tools,"I bought this saw to work with my Dremel 1100. Unfortunately, nowhere in the description of the product does it say that it only works with The Dremel 275, 285, 395, 398 and 780; not with the 1100."
4,Does what it says,I bought this tool for my father to attach to his dremel tool to help us fix one of our door frames. We had to cut out a 6 inch section of the frame and replace it. This dremel circular saw tool did the job exactly as we'd hoped.
1,Broke the blade AND my Dremel,"I also overheated the attachment, the blade stuck inside and then shattered and it burned out my Dremel motor. Not recommended, except for masochists."
2,Be prepared for jumping,"I was cutting 1/4 in press board. The little saw jumped, got hung and cut an edge it looked like I took a hacksaw to. No smooth edges, maybe because there wasn't a grain to the wood is what caused a problem. It also caused the dremel tool to get really hot. I wouldn't really recommend this but perhaps it was user error."
5,Excellent Saw Attachment,"Purchased to convert my dremel 400 into a hobby table saw and this little attachment is the heart of the conversion! Rugged, easy to attach and easy to operate! The saw blade is a breeze to instal and is quite easy if the unit is attached to the dremel. The Dremel 670 Mini Saw Attachment arrived in perfect condition and a day early as well. Overall, outstanding experiance!"
3,Good but it could be beter,This tool is too noisy and I have to use my dremel at it's higest velocity. Aparat of that it's ok to me.
3,"An amusing video, that has it's moments","Overall it's a nice tape. It's a little short(around an hour)though. It has some of the NBA's premier players in their college years. you see David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neil, Glen Rice, Derrick Coleman, and Kenny Anderson. There is also loads of great college players. Lots of Dunks, Blocks, and plenty of egos get hurt."
1,disaster,We expected this book to be a comprehensive description that the title said. We have such a book purchased previously. This book was a mere condensation of that which we wanted. It is useless! it is a waste of money! it is a misrepresentation!
1,I was disappointed...,"This book was a disappointment to me. I have the 4th edition, and was hoping to find new information on tryptophan. Nope, same mistakes as the previous edition, and same dated material regarding it still being banned in the US. This book comes from the estate of Phyllis, and I suppose that explains why the info is incorrect about the tyrptophan - which is currently available at most vitamin shops."
5,Excellent Book ...Quick and Easy Transaction,"I bought this book for my husband who is really into homeopathics. He had seen it in the store where he buys many of his supplents, etc. The Homeopath/Nutritionist who works there, had pulled this book out to show him something...he browsed through it and got the name and authour. He knew I ordered a lot of books from Amazon and asked me if I thought they would have this one. LOL OF COURSE, they will have it..I've never looked for one book that Amazon didn't have. He uses it a lot and is very pleased to have gotten it at the low price. (after sneaking a look at the price on the one at the Organic Food and Supplement store).Highly recommended..once again..easy ordering...quick shipping!!"
3,Prescription for nutritional healing: the a-z guide to supplements,"I was diasappointed in this and the ""sister"" book. I found no information on herbs I have used for my IBS. I also found the layout of both books confusing. I was hoping for a complete list of all herbal products, their uses, contraindications, and dosages for maximum efficacy. I would have returned it, but needed it for a gift that week."
2,Prescription for Nutritional Healing,"I wanted Prescription for Nutritional Healing, 4th Edition. I found a used edition on Amazon.com and ordered it. I received a copy sent by New CHAPTER RECYCLING, Inc. It was the 2nd Edition...not the 4th Edition and was quite worn..the book carried a price of $16.79...I Payed $27.98. So I am not happy..I didn't get what I ordered and I feel I payed too much for the book. Kathleen Bankston"
2,Unexpected,In the past I have purchased the first 2 volumes and they were fantastic. This one left me cold. It was small in size and was not as easily readable. Locating different herbs was difficult and frustrating. I much preferred the layout in Volumes 1 and 2.
2,Presciption for Nutritional Healing,"not what I expected. I'm familiar with the ""larger"" edition, which was what I expected, not the condensed version."
3,"Three and-a-half, really. Good but not as good as 'Tales from Margaritavision'. But get both while you can!","There are several Buffett/Buffett re-lated VHS out there. Buffett did onesong with the Neville Bros. on theirLive in New Orleans VHS. Middle ofthe Night is good song, even withAaron Neville maoning like he wantsto crawl back up into his Mama andbe 'born again', the hard way. Con-sider that a moment of weekness forJimmy, or a payback since the Neville'ssang on his 'Hot Water' LP. About theearrings Jimmy, 'no dice'...."
5,Sawsall Power Cord,Heavy duty and well worth the cost. You can easily take off from the saw when finished and pack away neatly.
2,lake tahoe,"For this cord with shipping i paid around 25 dollars. Ford that money i could buy 50 feet yellow jacket cord. Same with my v28 milwaukee set when i needed replacement battery. Fore one battery i paid over 150 dollars. This company sacking blood out of their loyal costumers. On the better side, this cord is for my sawzall and milwaukee just make the best sawzall on the market."
5,Passed Security+ 3/3/03 with this book.,I can't believe I passed the feared Security+ exam with just one book! This is a great study guide that is easy to follow and zones right in on the material that the exam focuses on. FIVE BIG STARS! It was well worth the [money]. Some hands on and this book and you will pass. I did.
3,good book but not good enough,took the test and failed by over 200 points i studied this book mostly because i read the a+ book by chris and passed with flying colors. i really thought i would do well until i took the test i could not believe that there was so much stuff on the exam that this book did not even cover. i only got this book because it was by the same guy who wrote the a+ adaptive exams book and that is a great book sorry chris this book just doesnt cut it.
3,Covers most of the material,"After reading this book and completing the Security+ exam, I found out that some material on the test was not covered in the book. While most was, there was also additional information that was not listed as objectives for the Security+ exam.I would recommend this book to learn more about the Security principles, however to complete the exam do not use just this book. I would also recommend the ExamCram as required reading prior to taking the test."
1,Does he really teach this?,"These other guys wo gave it 5 stars must be smoking something funny.I think Crayton forgot to include actual information that was relevant to the exam.The book was a GOOD OVERVIEW of basic securtiy, but it lacked the breadth of information needed to pass the exam.The sample exams in the at the end of the chapters and on the CD-Rom don't even come close to preparing you for the exam.Shouldn't followed my heart on a stude guide and gone with Syngress.PLEASE!!! PLEASE!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THIS ONE.He doesn't deserver to get paid for writing this guide."
1,Lots of errors -- see in book store for yourself,"This is just a bad book. another example of a book rushed to be published. Like the other reviewer says, this book contains many spelling and grammar problems. I wonder about its technical merits also"
1,FAILED my exam! Why? This book...,"What can I say -- its a book about security, but clearly not a book geared toward taking and passing this exam. Maybe better luck next time around."
3,Not Really An Encycolopedia,"I went and picked up this book from the local library thinking I would browse through it and then decide whether or not to buy. Glad I did this as anybody would be foolish to shell out $75 dollars for this book.It does have its bright spots. A lot of good reference material, outlines of the familes and groups and short bios of different criminals over the years. It was a usualful took in remembering where different people fit and allowed for easily and quick access to a variety of topics.However, the material is than less than exciting in reference to other crome books. While it covers a ton of mobsters I was suprised that it didn't include one my favorite characters, Roy Demeo. There were limited pictures in the book espically for what you expected for one as highly priced."
4,2011 edition omits two chapters,"My six-year-old son and I really enjoyed this book. It is reminiscent of the ""Little House"" series, but without the long descriptions of mundane details and with more emphasis on lessons to be learned.I would give it five stars, but for the fact that I learned that this ""Third Edition 2011"" is missing two chapters. Previous editions contained a chapter after ""The Red Bonnets"" entitled ""Grandpa's Apron,"" and one at the end entitled ""What Did You Expect?"" I have to admit, I thought the book ended rather abruptly. I can only imagine what was in the missing ending chapter. I searched the tables of contents for the other three volumes in the series here on Amazon and don't see them listed, so it doesn't appear as if they've moved. I wonder what happened to them?"
5,Very sweet book,My daughter keeps asking me how things were back then now :). My daughters were engaged and asked to go read the next chapter by themselves. Going to get the others in the series soon.
4,So much fun,"Grandma's Attic series is a fun, enjoyable series that you will treasure. The first book in this series is In Grandma's Attic. I read this book and More Stories from Grandma's Attic. I liked hearing about how when Mabel was a little girl, just as much as Arleta did. What I loved the most about these books is that the stories did have lessons with them. All the mischief that Mabel got into was entertaining to read. Besides Mabel, it was fun to get to know the rest of the family...Pa, Ma, and her two brothers, Rueben and Roy. There were so many amusing stories that I can not pick just one as my favorite. These books would make the perfect gift to share with your mom, sibling or grand children."
5,Perfect stories for young and old alike,"While these books are reprints of books that were orginally printed back in the 1974, I somehow missed them growing up, but I am so glad that I had the chance to read them now. I consider them timeless classics that will certainly appeal to many, and should be on every little girls bookshelf. While the stories that grandma shares with her grand daughter are fun to read they are also educational, and provide the reader with little life lessons. The illustrations peppered throughout the book are cute and will capture the imagination of the young reader.These books would make a perfect gift for young readers, but I think anyone who likes to reminisce about the ""Good Old Days"" will certainly enjoy these books.I was provided a complimentary copy of these books by B&B; Media in exchange for an honest review."
5,Oh Boy !,"A long and eagerly anticipated CD ... this release was so watched for. I don't EVER remember waiting for a recording so anxiously! And it's more than I could have hoped for. I'm over the top for this man's music and can never seem to get enough! A fan since early 1980's after seeing John live on tour with Patty Smythe... to have had the privilege to see him live again this summer touring with Frampton and Journey just reinforces my initial reaction : W O W !Masterpiece of Loneliness is positively brilliant - heartstopping poetry - - this song will bring you to your knees. My other favorites are Fly (a fabulous piece which should be a monstrous hit) and the blasting rocker ""Godhead"". Out on the internet tonite.....go John. We want more. And then more.Francie/Boynton Beach, Florida"
4,Good stuff,"I am not a regular fan of John Waites. I wouldn't even make a tape of his earlier albums (1980's) because, yes they had some great songs on them, but also a lot of filler. This cd is a different story. Good songs (a few great), great voice, and stripped down music. The album has a good feel to it. When I first heard the song 'Key to Your Heart' this summer, I had to have the album. Why this song was not the top selling, most played summer song I will never know? This is his best song ever (solo or group). He even sings a beautiful version of a Vince Gill song ('Whenever you come around') and makes it his own. All of these songs are sung with a deep conviction that oozes out of the speakers. This cd will make me buy his greatest hits cd next. This is smooth pop for adults...and anyone else who has good musical tastes!"
1,Wrong item,"I was excited to save 1/2 price on this compared to target. It has the same package, sku 03018 and upc number as Target. However the one I got on amazon was rev042008 so it did not have the correct mini usb cable I needed for my samsung seek. Have to send it back now."
1,Outdated,"This dictionary is really outdated. The words were collected more than a century ago and not in a very reliable fashion. And the writing system doesn't allow you to learn the pronunciation of words. If you want a really reliable reference to the Dakota get the New Lakota Dictionary, it includes Dakota variants for all Lakota words in it."
4,has flaws,this is a good dictionary but lacks some words (like full list of names for uncles) and doesn't give a full transcription regarding stops series
3,Queen of Sub-Continent,"The DVD doesnot contain numerous popular and classic songs of Lata Mangeshkar, The selection of songs specially under the title Melody Queen is not correct. Except one or two songs all other songs are of very bad selection.List of songs is also not provided by Amazon.com which gives the customer a bleak pitcure at the time of decision making.Not worth buying. It would be better if Queen in Concert and recently held and televised live concert of Lata Mangeshkar should be launched in DVD Format."
5,"Best ""Moisture Meter"" I've over owned","I use it for potted plants, not compost. Mantis is missing the boat by not marketing this as a plant moisture meter."
5,Works well with Dell GX270,We received some used Dell GX270's and I wanted to post a quick note that these worked just fine in our Dell GX270's.
2,Cures extreme boredom...,"I've had this game for a couple of years and decided to finally play it one day when I was bored. Although I saw other comments that the game could not run on XP, it ran perfectly fine on my system. The only thing I had to change was my version of Quicktime. Overall, there are some puzzles that can be tantalizing while others are practically common sense. There is really no character interaction at all, making it seem very similar to Mist. My least favorite part about the game is the ending. If you complete your task, there is no dramatic scene of your people being freed or really the ""bad guy"" perishing. Rather, it's a simple ""Congrats! You win!"" kind of ending. It occupied me for a few hours.."
2,Funny but not satisfying in the end,"I too enjoyed much of Stahl's black humor, but I grew bored eventually because I didn't find anything redeeming or attractive about any of the characters in this book.I understand that pivotal characters don't have to be likable, but I didn't feel anything for anyone after about 70 pages. Everyone in this novel seemed like scumbags, and not very interesting scumbags at that.Plainclothes Naked is titillating, but ultimately it's an unsatisfying read."
3,"Hilarious in Places, but Lacking in Discipline","Stahl has a wickedly imaginitive sense of humor. This novel was laugh-out-loud hilarious in spots, but could have been pruned somewhat to make it a better read. With time, and a firmer-handed editor, Stahl could develop into a very good writer."
3,Skip this and go for the real thing,"""Plainclothes Naked"" is antic and manic without ever really becoming funny or entertaining. He's trying and failing to do what Carl Hiasson makes look so easy-- construct a complex, multilined story around a vast number of damaged, low-life characters. Hiaason pulls it off (so did Dave Barry in his first novel, ""Big Trouble"") but Stahl moves the story too slowly without nearly enough of a sense of urgency to make it work. It reads like a good first draft. Oddly, the second half is better than the first."
5,Highly recommended reading . . .,"This book is well worth your time. It's the second in a series of stories about a couple of young men growing up in north east Texas during the drought of the 1950's.Forget the other 'coming of age' stories you've known. The Rivers boys take their own paths. Gray Boy, the rebel, finds himself in a sticky situation, not of his own making. Jake, the youngster, watches Gray Boy's troubles and tries to find answers to questions that bother him so.Read the first book, IN THE RIVERS FLOW, and then pick up RIVERS CROSSING. You won't regret the time you spend with the Rivers.Enjoy."
5,Rivers Crossing/ Gray Boy Rivers/ I love the book and boy,Rivers Crossing--Mr. Ainsworth has done it again. A superb book about the troubles faced by a boy crossing over to manhood. Gray Boy finds trouble by just breathing. Again I got to visit the Rivers family. Their lives are the lives of many families I know.I wish Mr. Ainsworth's books had no end.
5,Read Rivers' Crossing!,"In this, his second novel, Ainsworth revisits the Rivers family in a compelling story that combines love, murder, mystery, and an interesting look at core American values. If you liked In the Rivers' Flow, you will love Rivers' Crossing. If you have not read In the Rivers' Flow, read them both as soon as possible! The setting is rural east Texas in the 1950s, but it could be anywhere in rural America during that time frame. Ainsworth has an uncanny ability to breathe life into his characters. This one is a must read!"
4,"Good product, good value",The spring compressor seems to be of good quality. The price beat any like items seen on the internet.
3,Too Much Memoir--Not Enough Conflict,"I loved the opening chapters which feature tremendous conflict for Sun such as: If he will find the miracle, how to express his love for his cousin, how to escape his uncle's wrath. Also, the use of dialect was superb. Unfortunately, the remainder of the book indulges in too much memoir like description of Sun's early life without resolving so many of the issues around Sun's need for love and healing."
4,"The games okay, just needs improvement.","I really don't know why everyones dissing this game for, but I have to agree that somethings in this game have little rushes in them, but to diss this game, come on people relax & enjoy this game.I mean yes I know this game needs little improving but why not have fun when you can? Just go ahead & play the game & then see what you think of."
3,smackdown vs raw,smackdown vs raw 2007 is an ok game. the graphics are cool. the season mode looks like you are watching the show. and also the locker room is REALY COOL.BUT the controls for this game is very difficult. and the music gets REALY ANNOYING.also the makers of this game took alot of stuff away from creating a superstar.its a lot diffrent from the other wwe games. rent this game first to see if you like it. becuse 50$$ is a whole lot of money for a game.
5,good enough,one good thing with the fighting series is you can create a person. you can also create there fighting tag teams.
1,You punks don't know how bad this game!,"For the smarta**es that think this game is ""good"", think again.What we have here is a failure to communicate with each other person to person, frankly for somebody like THQ has done these things for quite full time. You can get this game for 50 cents in a yard sale but for 50 bucks in store is totally different. Spending that much for a sucked game especially that you want this so badly has all the sucked up features that you'll find.There ain't nothing good about this game really, so my advice is to give THQ, you guys can't make a good game at all so just retire & you guys can die happy!"
2,"Two and half stars overall, fun depends on your mood","So, what changed since 'Smackdown: Here Comes The Pain' ?Good: more things to do, fast grapple attack, graphics is WAAAY better, there is voice acting.Good: lot of old superstars, Hulk Hogan, The Rock , Mandkind, Steve Austin.Bad: you can't save tag team partner when he is in opponent's submission hold, although you can try to hit or catch him. Result: as if you try to hit ghost.Bad:you can find a pattern how to beat opponent and use it during WHOOOLE GAME! . Mick Foley is character I tried game with , just use right analog and tilt left and then punch opp. head. It is also easy , too easy to Irish whip to corner (L+diagonal+R1+X) and then just suplex them off the top rope.BAD: You need to work a lot to unlock Hulk, Rock, and other interesting guys.I just tried the game and that's it, TOO REPETITIVE FOLKS !"
3,WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2007,"Bought this game mostly for my son. He and his friends love it. However, learning the moves presents a significant challenge. There are just too much button combinations to remember."
1,THQ sucks!,"WWE games are great no doubt but this years installment(like the first Smackdown vs Raw) doesn't stand a chance with the other 6 games of the Smackdown series.If THQ wants to do the right thing, then they should do like everyone says THQ should do after Shut Your Mouth, retire now."
1,"Hacky is what this game is, & always had been in the beggining.","It wouldn't really matter how good looking Melina is in this game, she can't really wreslte in real life anyhow, besides that point this game has been screwed around with many bugs that make this game erase all the data, freeze the load times, slows the game down, & even makes you start over after you've won about everything.The point is, THQ always soldout when destroying & killing WWE games like this one, because frankly they're nothing but money hungry morons that cared for their own hide which is quite unique, wouldn't you say so?What I'm trying to say is that this game should've been improved with lots of gooder & greater features cause frankly, there are no great features in this game. All there is just about every small taste of no pleasure, that's all there is to it.P.S. Don't even touch this game, it's bad news."
1,The beggining-end of THQ(fortunately really ended after Shut your Mouth).,"Just like typical THQ, always join forces with WWE just to destroy another WWE game with movesets still keep disappearing one after another, creating a superstar that a has minimum options, bad features, boring matches, sucky gameplay, a new retarded control system, the non-sensed storylines, rosters that are outdated & lets say they're weak lists above all, & did I mention bad features.Don't even waste your money on this weak material for a sorry excuse of a game, buy some candy for a baby instead, over & out!"
1,"I have an idea, why don't we be like THQ & become the most hated & embarassing game company of the Universe!","THQ has became the most hated washed up company of the world & universe right after the successful Shut Your Mouth. Then they've decided to get much more greedy they've started taking everything out during the making of Here Comes The Pain through this installment, yuck.I was surprised at this effort, this was supposed to be like almost like Know Your Role, but failed of course.I felt like as this game was really rushed in because every feature in this game had 2006 calboration & some from 2005, yeah thats right.If you ask me, we sure are wasting our time by spending money on some guys from the THQ brand who doesn't give a big deal about us anymore.You want the game of all game historys, get NFL series, they're the best sports entertainment ever!P.S. Don't buy this [...]!"
2,Last year was better,"Being a fan of the Smackdown vs Raw games for the past couple of years I was disappointed in this years game. While many will probaly like the increased challenge and control options I prefered the control options from the past 2 or 3 years. I also liked the roster better for SD vs Raw 2006. While the Boogeyman, Bobby Lashley, and Mickie James were great reasons for me purchase this title I'm left a bit wanting and will probably continue playing SD vs RAW 2006."
4,REALLY GOOD GAME....but what is with the music,I have always gotten all the smackdown games...i have them all...and I like all of them and yes they have gotten better every year..THIS Years version is very good...they new controll setup new story lines the graphics its all good...Once you get use to the new control setup then it is a blast...BUT there are still a few things that neeed to be fixed...The annoucing is the same year after year...its the same diolauge as last year no change....the music is terrible I dont know where they get this stuff but i mute it everytime i am waiting for it to load...and the load times are slow...slower this year then before that is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars...hope they change that next year....
4,"Great game, but too many glitches","This game is really good, if you ignore the constant announcer blurbs, and all of the match glitches. If you're a WWE fan with a PS2, you most likely will enjoy this game."
4,its cool,smack downvs raw 2007 is fun because you can unlock new wrestlers. in this version when you pick a wresotler you can see the song and some times the pepoel might cheer or say boo. the bad thing is that the load time is a little slow. [...]
5,GREAT GAME!!!,"SVR 2007 was overall better then last years addition. You can now do a Multiplayer season mode! Which is great to play with friends if your going for the Tag Titles. The game it's self looks cleaned up graphic wise over last years version. The season mode and voice overs are AWESOME. So, if you enjoy playing the WWE games and are a fan of wrestling you want regret buying this."
4,great for the nursery!!,"This glider is perfect for my baby's nursery. It is affordable yet still strong and sturdy. The color is a little light, so I covered it with a coordinating blanket and I get tons of compliments!!"
2,Average Quality for Price,"We've had this chair for one month and it already squeaks when we rock in it. The seat cushion has sucken in and we are lighter folks, too. It's quite crammed and if you're bigger than me, over 5'3"" and not petite, it'll be quick uncomfortable. That being said. I might have considered something else that would have eliminated the $40 Target Shipping Price. These reviews made me think it was worth it...quality is just average but not worth this big price tag. Definitely shop around!"
2,DOESNT FIT ALL DRAWERS,I bought this for my office at work and the center of the item is so raised that I can not close the drawer. what a waste!
3,"Good Organization, but Didn't Fit","This organizer has a good number of compartments and is otherwise solid, but didn't fit in my file cabinet. I took out the Dremel and cut off the handles...now it fits."
3,"Helpful, but not ideal solution for my storage needs","I ordered this item since I work at a desk that only has file drawers and no place to put pens, paperclips, binders, stamps and other small items that I like to have handy without taking up valuable desk space. This product allowed me to to do that and for its price it serves the purpose. There is one major design flaw however, that needs to be pointed out. The sides of the unit that sit on the file rails is not flat, but rather has an arch built into it which while serving as handles and allowing for easy removal, it also prevents my file drawer from closing as they are raised to much. I had to take a hacksaw and cut the arches off to make it work in my setup. I also wish the back compartment was deeper to allow for storage of standard sized business envelopes."
5,As stated,"Not much to say, its a Dremel brand saw blade, very sharp and fit the Dremel. Precise as usual from Dremel!"
3,Dog loves it! But very greasy and always leads to upset stomach,"My puppy loves this, but because it's so long unless you have a fully grown large dog, you have to try to cut it into smaller pieces which is almost impossible. Also, they leave quite a bit of fat on these. I don't mind having to clean up and wipe the floors after the dog is done, but he ALWAYS gets diarrhea after chewing on these so I only use them if I'm really desperate for a distraction, then remove it after 20 min."
2,not great for sensitive stomachs,"Looked like these would be great when they first arrived. The pieces are large, and my pup enjoyed chewing away at them. However, my pup has a sensitive stomach and these treats give him loose stools whenever he eats them. I would not recommend for dogs with sensitive stomachs. Stick with flossies."
4,It's Natural and Delicious! 4 Paws Up!,"In a world where finding genuine natural dog treats and chews is a quest in itself, Old West provides an excellent choice for dogs of any age and size. These proved to be a hit for a retriever mix puppy who is very mouthy and in need of constant oral stimulation other than our tasty furniture. The strips are a little stinky, but in a good natural way, and dogs just LOVE that! While being chewed, they start to shred a bit and look like a stringy spaghetti stick. They were an instant hit and only suggestion would be that they were a little longer or maybe another strip in the package for the price. We will be looking into other natural products from Old West as these were puperific!"
2,Double Charge,"Right after I purchased this plan, I had to change my area code. I live in Boston, but they gave me New Orleans area code where I lived 2 years ago. There was no problem to change my area code, but they charged me twice for both of the numbers even though I changed the code on the day of receiving phones."
3,Missing Crank Handle,"My Crank handle was missing and when I called Mantis it takes a week or so to get it with no overnight option for shipping. I was very disapointed.However, I put it all together myself so it can be done and other than twisting the head off of one screw it was easy to put together alone. However I am 6'5"" tall with long arms and some muscles to speak of.I have yet to make a batch yet. I'll update when I do."
2,It's not that great,"I bought this compost maker and like another customer the turn handle was missing, I contacted Mantis and they sent me a new one after I sent them proof that I had purchased it, the compost I'm getting is not really that high of quality, I've had it for almost three months and turn it every other day, the grass clippings are almost whole and brown after three months and it doesnt work as fast. For the price I paid for I can get more dirt/compost from home depot than what this compost maker makes. I stay away from it if I would have to buy another one. It also attracks a lot of flies and it smells bad, so keep it distanced from your door steps."
5,HEAVENLY SOUNDS FOR CHRISTMAS,"I watched this group sing on public television here locally, I had to get the CD after. Thank you Amazon.com; I tried locally to obtain the CD, none of the stores here had the CD, in fact, none even heard of 'Libera'. Amazon came through for me. This has got to be the best CD I have in my collection ; just amazing the sounds that come out of these kids. Buy it for sure you will not be disappointed."
2,Too much fanfare,"For me, the performance simply missed the mark. A capable choir should be able to stand forth and sing out without a surround of distracting instrumentation. Though the poor have already suffered enough, I promptly gave my copy of this CD to charity. For that I beg forgiveness."
4,great toy on many levels,"My son got this as a gift and loves it, though he is not generally big on action figures. It has awesome workmanshp and durability. It comes with many interesting gizmos that kids enjoy playing with even more than the figure. It is supposedly a military good-guy, but the figure is has dangerous, secret-agent, ninja almost-bad-guy aura. I love that it comes with a special case to keep all the little gizoms from getting lost. Other kids have played with it at our house and got hooked on the character. You can get a great hovercycle for it too."
5,"Great Boys Toys, Sigma Six Collection","We are very very impressed with the Sigma Six collection. Snake eyes was a great suprise for my step-son this Christmas, he LOVED it!! These do however have small parts and I would not recommend them for younger children as the parts are eaisly lost or could be swallowed... Overall they're a great imagination builder for boys who love action figures!!"
2,Confusion over description,"Unless you have the number, you will not know which one to order. There are two very different cords with identical descriptions. I opted for the expensive one first and it was the wrong one. The exchange was good, however, so we are happy campers. You just need to know the number before you order."
3,replacement purchase...,"I purchased this cord as a replacement for my Milwaukee drill that i rarely used since the original cord was cracked ""kept coiled up in a workbench draw"", I should have checked the polarity of the old cord first but didn't since the last time I used the drill it worked fine, the next time i went to use it, it didn't, wasn't the cord...not overly impressed with Milwaukee."
3,Cord for Magnum Hole Shooter by Milwaukee,"My ""Hole Shooter"" dates back 30 years, so the Quik-Lok doesn't work for my drill. I decided to make due by cutting off the quick lock and wiring it in myself. Therefore, I doubt if this review is of much use."
2,mehhhh.....nothing special....just decent,"Glad i grabbed this from the amazon warehouse for a fraction of full price, nothing special, flavor is pretty weak, too much spice and no butter or rum and the roast is very light. Definitely not worth the full price here at amazon but i have had worse."
4,Boiled Bludis,"Jack Bludis gives us a fast-paced, down and dirty ride through the mud puddles of post-war, pre-McCarthy Hollywood sleaze. The casting couch is all full up. Starlets are drugged and set up in smut shoots. Everybody's partying, boozing, and smoking, making movies, making money, and making each other. The studio morals clause is hanging over stellar heads and blackmail is the big easy.There's a switch inside every switch in this book until you hit the big one Bludis has set in a powerhouse of a denouement."
5,does the job!!,"I love my XM Radio, but the model (Delphi Roady) didn't come with a remote. Have it on the other side of the room which makes it a pain when I get a phone call or want to change channels. This solved the problem. Love that I have direct access to stations, via the numeric keypad. All the other features are here also. Works great and I use it more than I ever thought I would. Has helped me to enjoy my XM radio even more."
2,Expensive for what it is,"I was disapointed when I unwrapped this item, very expensive for what it is. a loose weave screen would do the same job."
5,Read Rothbard,Rothbard wields a pen like a knight wields a sword. His analysis is so precise and so appropriate for all times and all places. This book will give you an entirely new perspective on all the myths you didn't even know you held dear. Read Rothbard.
5,Direct flawless theory,Murray Rothbard really knocked it out of the park!This book spells out very clearly what a Libertarian world could be.The absence of government seems scary and wierd until you are educated.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is waking up from the hazeof the big media nanny state. Individual liberty for all!!!!!
4,Free,"It is a very scholarly, well written book that explains the libertarian philosophy the best I've read. Also, you would like Ron Paul's liberty defined."
2,Not Effective For an Axe,"The size of the slit in this attachment is too thin for all of my lawn tools (axe, clippers, and shovels) So I can only sharpen knives with this. Not worth the money."
1,waste of time and money,I fiddled with this for about 20 minutes before I ended up taking a file to the lawnmower blade and doing things the old way. The Dremel attachment just did not give the correct angle to properly sharpen the blade. Nice idea and I was hoping it was going to work better but no luck.
1,Es casi inútil.,"Lo compré, pero cuando lo coloque en el Dremel me decepcionó el resultado, es más útil una piedra de amolar."
3,Good for midseason sharpening,The Dremel lawnmower blade sharpener works pretty good. But only as a midseason blade sharpener. Be careful sparks fly all over the place with this tool. If your blades are really dull take them to the pros but at midseason this tool will help put the edge back on a mild dull blade. Buy extra 932 grinding stones because you'll go thu them quick.
2,If you've got a file and some boy scout skills use those.,"I got one of these with my dremel tool. It works, but I really think a dremel tool is underpowered for sharpening applications. I spent some time trying to sharpen my shovel with it and finally gave up and grabbed a file and had it finished and a second shovel in less time and with far less noise. Let's face it, neither shovel or lawnmower blades need to be as accurately sharpened as a knife and a file will work handily, cost the same and last longer."
2,didn't fit my mower blade,"It is a little difficult to explain, but this did not fit my mower blade. I guess it would give the correct angle on an axe or another 'flat' item. I have a toro mower and the blade has a curve in the horizontal and the black plastic guard does not give a consistent angle when I move it down the length of the edge. I can still use it by taking the guard off, but then it is just a grinding wheel."
1,Save your Money,The plastic attachment part is not wide enough for the blade on my Honda walk behind mower but using the 932 grinding stone freehand was pretty easy providing your blade is not to chewed up.
2,Mulching blades a problem.,"The housing may work on flatter blades but it binds on the curves in my mulching blade (from a Black and Decker electric mower). However, the stone worked fine freehand."
1,Mower blades won't fit into the attachment,"I don't know about blades of single-blade push mowers, but the blades on my Deere L108 riding mower absolutely won't fit into this attachment. They are way too thick - you'd have to snap off the bottom portion of the attachment to even get the grinding wheel to be able to reach the blade.So don't consider this for riding mower blades, at least the ones on a Deere."
2,Not recommended for rotary-push movers,"I thought this would work on push mowers, but I should have recognized that the straight guide would not work well on the curved blades. It was not possible to sharpen the full blade with this tool."
2,"Works Good In Theory, But...","For under $10, I figured there was no harm in trying this tool. It *looks* like a great idea and simple to use, however, it didn't work very well for me.I have a push mower and a riding mower, so I started with the push mower's blade first. It's a 20"" Sears mower with a 'mulching' blade. The problem I had with the tool is that it's very hard to slide across the blade; perhaps the blade on my lawnmower was too thick for the tool or the small amount of grass on the blade provided too much friction.After struggling quite a bit to get the tool to move across the blade, I eventually got the blade slightly sharp, but the sharpening stone is already quite warn... there's no way I'll be able to do the three blades on my riding mower.I was hoping to avoid using the good 'old file method to sharpen the blades, but I think that might actually be the easier method. The tool is well made and easy to install, but it's a little harder to use than one might think."
1,Lawn mower blade sharpener attachment for Dremel,"I usually give the products I buy from Amazon very good ratings, but not this time. I tried it on two different blades and had no luck in being able to use it to sharpen blades. Apparently it doesn't work for all blades. I ended up using my Dremel to sharpen the blades without any attachment. Sorry folks, but I cannot recommend it."
1,Dont waste your money,"I sharpened three blades for my garden tractor using a file, a conventional electric grinder, and the dremel attachment. Careful use of the grinder produced the sharpest edge. It also produced by far the most uniform edge and was the quickest too. The gap on the attachment is a bit smaller than the thickness of the blade which occasionally gouged the blade as I moved the stone."
4,Not as functional as I hope,Get this to sharp my lawnmower blade but find that it's maybe too tight ( the opening ) to allow you freely move it through the blade and make the sharpening process more complicated than it should be .. so I end not using the plastic part ..
2,don't bother,engages but ultimately does not deliver.the ending leaves you hanging and you don't know what happens to the main character.he also is not particularly sympathetic .almost worth watching but not for the ten dollars i paid.not to mention completely depressing.no real point to it other than a low life is willing to sell out everyone including his own mother[literally] to survive.he deserved all got
2,Disappointing,"If you have been waiting anxiously for a poorly acted, more boring version of the great film 'Pusher' you are in luck!"
2,Remake of an Original,This movie is a remake of a Russian movie. I recommend the original over the remake anytime. This movie reminds of the French film Sleepless Night.
5,Very dramatic.,"The author has a great technique for making you feel the fear and causing the hair on your neck to stand on end. I could actually visualize the environment and the scenes depicted. I found the hunts relating to the panthers especially dramatic.I also appreciated the way the story portrayed why the animals turned to maneating, resulting from an injury or handicap."
1,Truth or fiction?,"Being somewhat of a student of Corbetts writing, I was really looking forward to the first new book written about him in some time. Jim Corbetts own writing is full of moment by moment, edge of your seat type of adventure. I was hoping this book would dig more deeply into Corbett the man. Overall I was very disappointed. The book is shallow, inaccurate, and in places dramatized. For the life of me I can't understand why anyone would think they could add to the story as written by Corbett himself. Worst of all some events where altered from what Corbett wrote. If you have never read one of Corbetts own accounts this one might be okay. If you have read the real thing, then don't bother with this book."
1,Defacing a Legend,"If I could give this book ""No Star,"" I would. This is a badly written and shamefully fictionalized re-hash of the career of a true hero. It does Jim Corbett a real disservice. To anyone interested in Corbett's career, I strongly recommend you read instead Corbett's own accounts, Man-Eater of Kumaon, The Temple Tiger and the Man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag. All are easy to obtain if not new then second-hand. They are much better written, much more exciting, and true. The author of this book should be ashamed of himself for defacing a legend."
1,Very disappointing if you really enjoy Jim Cobett's books,"I am a VERY big fan of all Corbett 's books and some other biographies of Colonel Jim Corbett , but this Tim Werling book is pitifully written. This book has none of the "" smell of gun oil , and gun powder mixed with fear and excitement"" that Man Eaters of Kumoan (and Corbetts other books) encapsulate. Tim Werling style is more akin to a Mills and Boon love novel than Corbetts 450 400 double nitro express rifle style . Master of The Jungle was a major disappointment to me. I even tried to give my copy of Master of the Jungle away for free at a gun show and no one wanted it! Any one that gives this 5 stars lives on sugary cotton candy (called Fairy Floss in Australia) Dont waste your money I unfortunately wasted mine!"
2,WERLING writing about CORBETT,"I have read many of these kinds of books. However, I was not able to finish reading this book. WERLING lacks the writing skills of the greats in this line of true-life adventures. He could not get me to ""feel"" for or with the characters, nor re-create the carousel of emotions that you would experience if you were actually there. His book did not bring his subject to life, and it was not interesting to read. Sorry, Tim."
1,Wild Tigers and Tamed Donkeys,"After reading the 5 star reviews, I ordered a copy of this book, and felt like seeing tamed donkeys in a national park in the Far East after paying to seewild tigers. This book is pure fiction!The 5 star reviews have the same style (same person?)."
2,VERY DISAPOINTED,I have wanted this item for quite some time since I love to keep my office organized. I finally decided to purchase it even though I thought it was a bit pricy for something like this. The image of the product actually looks a lot better then when the product arrives. It seems very cheaply made and it is very flimsy. I was very disapointed after spending about $40.00. Save your money!!!!!
5,great office supply,"Durable and does not take up too much desk space. gift for a co-worker, he loved it."
3,organizer,"works well for keeping the bills, mail, coupons,pencils and pens,and keys. The 2 lower compatments didn't fit too well to the top, so I spilt it up. Should be priced at $19.95 or less."
4,Not Just for Janeites,"Jane Austen and Co. is an interesting and fairly thorough look at our current culture's obsession with recreating the past through film. The essays are scholarly without being overly dry, and could appeal to a more casual reader. Some are better than others, but they are all pretty perceptive and realize that history on screen says more about the present than the past. Austen adaptations get the lion's share of attention in the essays, but also discussed are loose interpretations of Austen like Clueless and Bridget Jones, as well as other films such as Dangerous Liaisons, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the Wings of the Dove. Sometimes the connections between the non-Austen essays with the others seems a little weak, but as a whole, Jane Austen and Co makes for some thought-provoking reading."
3,Not My Favorite Art,If you haven't read any Green Lantern graphic novels this one will make absolutely no sense at all. It starts out with Hal dead and the spectre inside of him. The art was not my favorite of the Green Lantern series. The characters look so different in this one than in all of the other books. I prefer the artist for Blackest Night. I'd definitely suggest reading the stories previous to this one in order to understand what's going on here. If you aren't up on everything in Green Lantern's world you will be even more lost than I was!Reviewed by Kole for Book Sake.
5,Really enjoyed.,Let me start off by saying besides the very basic knowledge of Green Lantern(I'm a Marvel Guy) I had no real background information to color my view of the way the characters were written. The way Geoff writes the Hal Jordan mystique was powerful but never overboard. I like the way Geoff gives you a sense of who Hal Jordan is by having the other characters he has connections with talk about him. Rarely is it Hal saying I went through this and this happened to me. It's not until the end where Hal starts to examine the things that he's been through that you hear his voice. By that point his self evaluation does become this really believable Rebirth. Geoff's writing was on point. And the art work was off-the-hook too.
5,Excellent Green Lantern Story,"Unfortunately, I read this book out of turn with what was going on in the Green Lantern/DC Universe. Regardless, it's an excellent story that I enjoyed greatly."
5,Incredible,Geoff Johns really outdone himself on this series. He was able to bring back one of the most beloved DC characters in such a way that his character would still be intact. Great story with great art. All I can really say is that you have to experience this one for yourself. If you like GL or Hal Jordan you must pick this up.
5,Geoff John's Thank You,"In the 1990's DC wanted to start fresh with Green Lantern so they made him go crazy , kill the corps, and become Parallax. Much later Hal Jordab/ Parallax died saving the sun or some bull.But Hal Jordan is brought back in this four issue mini series by Geoff Johns and Ethan van Sciver.The story is that Hal Jordan is now the host for the Spectre but Parallax is coming back. Kyle Rayner who'd been Hal's replacement while he's been gone recovers his body from the sun and brings it back to earth. Now not giving alot of spoilers but Hal Jordan is revived and there's an explanation of why he went crazy and killed some people.The Writing is good and is easy to read and understand for new comic book fans. The artwork by Ethan Van Sciver is spectactular. It's highly detailed giving a some what realistic view of the comic. I reccomend to anyone even if your not a green antern or comic book fan."
5,Johns can really turn a lemon into lemonade!,"I just want to add a point to all these great reviews...This series FINALLY makes sense out of the ring's (gimmicky) limitation to the color yellow. For decades I had to overlook this seemingly arbitrary and outdated plot device. It made no sense in most stories. But... Geoff Johns crafted a story here that not only solves the problem of Hal's (alleged; since I hate that story) insanity that led to murdering the Green Lantern Corps, it also legitimizes the GL ring's yellow ""impurity."" Johns also corrects a 1990s misconception of what ""fearless"" means for Green Lanterns (it no longer means stupidly oblivious to reason and danger).And of course, Rebirth corrects one of DC's biggest mistakes--the corruption of the greatest Green Lantern ever, and returns him to the DCU. But this isn't a return to glory. No, it's the beginning of the greatest run of Green Lantern comics ever. A real must-read!"
4,Hal's Return,A great story put together by Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver heralding the return of Hal Jordan to the role he was designed to play. Picked up this trade at a good price and quick shipping. Thanks !
4,Great way to correct course,"While the writers at DC have made a nightmare of the GL lineage over time by making our original GL the Spectre and giving us a lantern that doesn't need a ring to produce the green power, this is the moment that Johns attempts to correct all that. And he mostly succeeds. Great artwork and storytelling are only betrayed but what seems like a rushed conclusion to me. Overall a must read."
5,An excellent starting point for a GL newb,"I didn't know much about GL before going into this, but that has certainly changed! This comic is not only extremely informative (re: The GL mythos), but it is also an overall amazing read. I recommend it, not only to current Green Lantern fans, but also to anyone who reads comics at all! This is an absolute must-read!"
4,"Entertaining, but not for the new reader.","Rebirth was my first introduction to the Green Lantern Series, and as a new comic reader I was completely lost. How were Hal Jordan, Specter, and Parallax related? How was Hal Jordan's body in the center of the sun while he was strolling around Earth? Who was the odd, drooling, wheelchair-bound character with the enourmous head that the comic cut to twice, but who never effected the story?No amount of research will make this graphic novel understandable to the uninitiated. It is NOT an entry point to the series. If you are a new reader, almost any other trade paperback would be better. The entire point of this story arc is to rewrite the Green Lantern universe, so it focuses on resolving past plot holes and discontinuities.Having said all of that, if you are an experienced Green Lantern fan, you will love Rebirth. But if you are, then you already know that."
5,Rebirth of a Hero,"""Green Lantern: Rebirth"" tells the story of how Hal Jordan returns from the dead. the writing is superb and Johns' succeeds in explaining how things happened that have been unanswered for so long such as why the Green Lanterns rings have the ""yellow impurity"". Van Schiver's art is some of the best that I have seen, all of the charecters and landscapes look photo -realistic but still have a ""comic-book"" like feel to it. I reccamend to all."
4,Very strong book,"I have to admit that I have never thought much of the Green Lantern(s). They just never seemed that interesting to me, but I also heard bits and pieces of their history and I know their general history. I was surprised when I started to hear great things about Rebirth and I figured that it would be a good jumping on point, and it was.Geoff John's somehow managed to pull off a old comic book cliche (It was my clone, It was a robot, I was possessed) but also make it very interesting and he intertwined it very nicely into the story. I would also like to thank him for getting rid and explaining why Green Lanterns are afraid of the color Yellow.While the story and the art are both good though I honestly didn't think Green Lantern: Rebirth was really that great. I mean the way people talked about it I thought it would be like Watchmen or Kingdom Come. Instead it was just a strong story. Worth getting, but its nowhere near the hype in my eyes."
4,"Very good, but not great.","Yes, to many (myself included) Hal Jordan IS Green Lantern.Sure, there have been stand-ins on Earth and there are a lot of GLs out there in space, but for Earth, for the bulk of DC stories, Hal IS THE Green Lantern.He's been gone for a while, and now he is back.If you don't know how he died, why he died, and what all the hype is behind the return of Hal Jordan, a lot of what makes this TPB special will be lost on you.The art is amazing. There are parts of this story that will stick with you for a long time after reading it and some scenes will replay in your mind - the art is that good!However the return of Hal Jordan, for all the importance it should have, is somehow not all that big a deal in the end.The reason WHY yellow itself was the one thing the rings of the GLC were immune against is bigger, in my mind, than is Hal's return, both of which are featured in this tale.A must for GL fans, a good read for serious DC fans, and a sample of great art for others."
5,Thanks,I really like your comic I really excited for the next book you better make one. Then I want to reed more
3,Inexpensive Pillow Protector,"Pillow protector should work fine: it does have a chemical smell to it, hopefully it'll go away during the first wash. The product is worth $4, not sure why the list price was $55- this is a cheaply made product, and should be priced accordingly."
5,"SUPERB COLLECTION, SUCCINCT BIO'S, AUTHORS'S PERSPECTIVES NICE PLUS","A ""you can't go wrong collection"". Great for budding writers. Great for those long days of summer! Easily worth twice or three times the price."
1,snooze,Bought for a class. WORTHLESS WASTE OF MONEY. Nothing new. Nothing innovative. BORING AND POINTLESS. Pointless to review since no one who is not in school & required to buy will do so. blah blah blah
3,Well..,"Interesting: I guess I didn't realize that the book was extremely used and written in--not that it bothers me, I was just surprised. But even though it's a beaten up book and all, I'm happy with my purchase because it arrived on time and I like reading what the previous owner has written on the pages. (:"
1,Please read,"I am taking a Japanese class in college and we are using this book as our textbook. There are no answers for the exercises. The conclusions and explanations are ambigous at best. This is not a hard language, but this book can turn that around. I am on amazon.com looking for another book right now, because this one is so lacking. Also there are a great deal of misinformation that is given. Possibly because of when this was published."
3,"Solid textbooks, but you'll need a good teacher.","Volumes I and II feel like linguists wrote them. With the right teacher, they are quite good. With the wrong teacher, I could see them being disastrous. The strength of this series lies in the presentation of the grammar in a very abstract and clear format. The amount of Kanji per chapter (once you get to Volume II) is sufficient and easily digestible. The drills and exercises are fine. I wish the authors had included all the Japanese words from Volume I in Volume II. I haven't had experience with Volumes III and IV yet, but I would be satisfied to continue with this series if they are chosen as the textbooks for the second-year Japanese classes that I intend to take. For those interested in studying Japanese, I'd also suggest Kodansha's Furigana Japanese Dictionary (ISBN: 4770024800) and NTC's New Japanese-English Character Dictionary (ISBN: 0844284343)."
5,Great starter,"For some reason, my garden soil does not contain the thermophilic bacteria necessary to start a compost pile. This product is the solution. Mix brown stuff like leaves and green stuff like grass in a 2:1 ratio and use this for bacteria, water well and you will have a hot pile in two days!"
5,Ringer Compost Starter,"It seems to work. 2 comparable compost piles (grass clippings, chopped leaves, food waste), one treated with Ringer compost starter, the other not. After three days, temperature of the treated pile was 97 degrees, untreated pile 83 degrees (air temperature 81 degrees). The compost starter seems to kick things off in a hurry, so hopefully the compost will be just about done by the time freezing weather comes.Packaging: Some of the pelletized starter leaked out of the product box into the shipping box. There did not appear to be any damage or holes in the box, so I think it just fell through some weak seams on the box."
5,This stuff really works,"I have been trying for about two years now to get a compost bin going - but I have had to plant two gardens with store-bought compost. This spring, I bought the Ringer 3050 Compost Plus and saw that it would take 60-90 days to get the compost going. Well, I threw the whole box in (a little at a time, mixing it) and wet things down thoroughly. I went out today, about a week later for the ""7-10 day turnover"", and was VERY surprised to see (and smell) a rich compost in the making. I probably won't be planting my garden for another month or so, but I'm really confident that by then, I will have a large pile of compost to plant in, and a good base to continue making compost for years to come."
4,quicker compost,This really did make a difference in the time it took my compost to break down. I think it is a good value and a nice way to get things moving along in the compost pile~
3,Need Mulch and more mulch,Instructions not real clear... i don't know how much to add :( to my large composter. I will see in 90 days if i have mulch....maybe
3,Is it working ?,"It's hard to tell if this product is working. I received it as ordered applied it as directed to just one side of the compost barrel, it doesn't seem any different than the other side after 3 weeks."
2,Very poorly packaged,"Product arrived on time, but packaging did not hold all of the composting material. There was about 1 cup of the small granuals (which smell like cat feces) inside the box shipped by amazon. This was going to be a tag along gift for the composter I bought, but didn't seem like that good of an idea to wrap it and give it to the sister in law given the condition of the box. I will update this review when the functionality of the product is assessed."
3,Who knows?,It's hard to tell if anything other than the natural process of decomposition is taking place especially since the ingredients are not listed.
2,you don't need this product.,"i have never needed to add anything to my compost pile to get it to work.it is a slow go during cold months ,but in the heat of summer you can't stop it.wet it ,turn it ,repeat.easy as that.tom"
1,no effect,"It's been sitting in my compost bin for more than a week, but the thing is not heating up, and I do not see any changes whatsoever"
4,really good product,"The product description was exact.The product was delivered on time, in good condtion and in great packaging. Overall I am happy with my purchase."
4,Back Again to the Older Style Bag?,I'm not sure what's what - but I just ordered and received one of these from Amazon. The one that arrived was 24-1/2 by 13 x 14 - had interior and outside pockets and seemed to be heavy duty nylon. I'm happy.
3,Large enough,"I perchased this bag to hold several cordless Milwaukee tools and it does this well. The pros are that it is large enough to fit all my tools and has plenty on inside pockets. It has a carrie handle that feels strong. The cons are that it seems a little thin, time will tell if it will hold up."
2,Vague and inconclusive,"I bought the book because I am looking for a blue water cruiser to take me round the World.I liked the design explanations especially stability. However I was astonished at the brevity of the section on Keels. Less than a page on one of the most controversial aspects of blue water sailing.The section on ""Five Good Boats"" is disappointing in that the boats are not widely available, apart perhaps from the Pearson. In an article in the Pearson Owners association web site the designer implicitly states the Pearson range were designed for coastal work.There is no mention of any of the popular boats generally regarded as offshore suitable.The author - the Technical Committee of the CCA, is no doubt a prestigious and experienced body, but it is heavily involved in racing and I think this shows.The addition of a section on popular ""offshore"" boats and their strengths and weaknesses would have put my rating up to 4 stars."
3,Nothing New Here,"I was a bit disappointed in this movie. The music wasn't that great and the re-enactment scenes were a bit cheesy. Some new things came to light, but all in all, I wish I hadn't spent the money."
1,Did Anyone Proofread This Book?,"This book has so many errors, it makes me wonder if the folks at Sams publishing has any proofreaders on their staff. On the back of the book there is a mention of how to remove red-eye. Is there any tutorial in the book on how to do this? No. On page 46 there is an example of the ""New File"" dialog box. The example says to see diagram 3.1. Diagram 3.1 shows a picture of Sun Microsystem's web-site. Funny, I don't go to Sun's web-site when I open a new file in PSP. Add to these errors some misspelled words, vague references, and poor examples and you have a book that is not worth your money."
2,Weak tutorials and techniques,"Considering the power of PSP7 and the excellent techniques that are demonstrated in the tutorials on the various JASC linked Web sites, I was very disappointed at the quality of the techniques presented in this book. I found the tutorials themselves were difficult to follow. In fairness, I had only completed about 9 of the 24 'hours' before I gave up and looked for a diffeerent book."
1,PSP 7 Information,"If you are new to PSP this book may be adequate. If you are looking for definitive information about the outstanding new features of version 7, look elsewhere. PSP's newest features are either glossed over or completely omitted. It seems that, in this case, the sofware program exceeds the ""Teach yourself ----- in 24 hours"" format."
1,"Is this one of those ""based-on-the-beta-release"" books?","I found this book on the bargain rack for half it's cover price...It still wasn't worth it. During the step-by-step the author skips steps. When he says to click an option, it isn't there. He may be referring to the bar menu choices, the right-click choices or PSPs ""exploding window"" choices, but you are not going to know. Anybody want to buy a slightly-used PSP book?...You can't have mine - I threw it in the trash."
2,Just Not Good.,"I have used Sams Teach Yourself series (5 books) and have been satisfied for the most part. This book however leaves ALOT to be desired!! I might just be me...but as a reader I expect to be reminded where items are as I go through the book. This book explains what the buttons are in the first chapter...by the time I get to chapter 3 or 4 I have forgotten most of the 20+ buttons and options described in Chapter 1. Every chapter after gives the name of the button, but not an illustration of it. Also the author leaves you guessing about buttons and menu items since he does not mention which is which. Sorry, but this one can't cut it...I'm returning it to BNB and getting Paint Shop Pro Web Graphics (Because of High Rating Here) to see if better written and explained."
1,Says XP compatible - but not,We got this game since our boy will be going to Kindergarten this fall. The description said it was XP compatible - but it won't even load.
4,Fast moving publishing caper,Great read and quite a page turner. Some laugh out loud scenes and many more entertaining. Recommended.
4,A quick one..,"Sealab 2021 died with Harry Goz. Stick with Seasons 1 & 2. 'Nuff said.... and now I'm gonna say more. ""Der Dieb,"" ""Vacation,"" ""Tinfins,"" and ""Hail Squishface"" (a hilarious parody of Star Trek's ""Trouble With Triffles"") are equal to Season 1's ""Happycake,"" ""All That Jazz,"" and ""Simutacs."" Oh, and must insert the obligatory reference:""BIZARRO! I LOVE YOU! BIZARRO!""Included on the DVD is a tribute to Goz, along with some decent commentaries and interviews with the cast. You love truly gonzo, insane cartoon humor? GET IT."
3,Not as great as season 1 but still hilarous,I love sealab 2021 was really excited when season 2 came out but it didn't have the same whit as season 1 however the other seasons following got much better
1,Big Disappointment,I've had the first season on DVD for years and I can't tell you how many times I've watched it. I finally bought the second when I found it on sale and seriously? One or two episodes were amusing but most of it was just obnoxious. Save your money and just pretend like it was a one season run.
2,Meh,"Had high hopes for this DVD set, turned out to be not so funny. Got it for 6 bucks though, so not a big deal."
2,Waste of money,"Well it did light up. But you only get full intensity at max RPM. And even then it isn't that bright. It's also far bulkier than the standard collar, which makes seeing around it a challenge at times. But the major FAIL is this will not work with the Dremel 4486 MultiPro Keyless Chuck installed. I confirmed this with Dremel. You have to use the outdated collet nut supplied with this, which means pulling out a wrench all the time."
4,Buy the 2000 edition (english) if you want pictures,"Because France does not change that much, Michelin Green Guides (1994 edition) did not change either. They still keep this handy pocket format that all other publishers copied. They still are very shy with pictures. They don't tell you everything you would expect from a french guide-book. Still, they tell you what is most important. You cannot make any mistake if you follow their advice. So bring this guide-book with you ... and buy the Knopf or Eyewitness guide to get a more detailed view of our nice region. If you want to get advice from famous Michelin staff about restaurants and places to stay, buy the 2000 edition (english)of this book. If you are interested in more than just castles, read the ""Wine and food guide to the Loire"" from Jacqueline Friedrich and bring back home some bottles of Champigny wine."
2,A sub-par effort.....and I'm being generous giving 2 stars.,"For those of us raised in the 70's, the Ghoul is a TV legend. I was eagerly looking forward to the release of this book. Imagine my disappointment with the half-hearted results this book provides. There are a number of excellent entries, photos, and movie/song listings that make the book worthwhile for a one-time trip down memory lane (at your public library), but there is no in-depth look at the show's production, workings, or man behind the beard. The Ghoul will always be the King of late-night TV, but this book is sorely lacking in anything of kingly quality."
4,Ahh the days of channel 61 come flooding back!,"Growing up in Cleveland, I havn't thought of him in years (and am surprised he is still doing his show!) While I havn't read this book yet, just the thought of the old Sat nights watching the Ghoul making fun of some bad B movies was a treat! I plan on getting this book and good or bad, the memories it brought back are priceless! I had all but forgotten him and the other guys, Holuhan and Big Chuck. Don't rememeber that Ghoulardi guy...."
1,A Short Picture Book for Youngsters,"This book has lots of nice pictures, but at 150 pages, really doesn't tell the fans of the Ghoul anything we didn't know already. Save your money, buy the Ghoulardi book instead (compare the two books-- Ghoulardi book is far superior--Ghoul book is a pale imitation, right down to graphics, book size, and layout). True fans will be disappointed! Don't say I didn't warn you!!"
2,Poor designed,"Not great for burgers and chicken wings, the spaces in the grids are too big. Two stars for the price, but you get what you pay for...[...]"
1,Not happy at all...,"Maybe I'm not that smart,...but this was pre-assembled and all we had to do was slide the tray in the grill and add charcoal. We let it warm up and after about 10 minutes there was an overwhelming smell of burning paint or plastic? The charcoal was a normal kingsford type and there was never anything else added... ??? We couldn't get the smell to go away no matter what we tried. So, now our steaks remain in the fridge instead of our bellies...great fun..."
2,the second one had less dents then the first!,"Well we like the BBQ but the first one we got was so damanged! Dented, broken handles - had to send it back. The second BBQ only had a broken handle so we decided to keep this one - we were afraid to see what the next one would look like! It was almost a joke at this point. If you buy this I would make sure you pick it up in person."
1,the hardest barbecue I have ever mounted,"Whatever the quality of the product, guys who designed a barbecue where you have to use hammer, screw and wrench, where manual has big drawing mistakes, when you need 30 min to figure out the back and the front should be banned from product design for life. Go to IKEA and learn some user experience lessons."
2,sticker glue never able to re-moved and it cracked,"After 5 months of used, it cracked right at the center, glue still stay and turn to ugly black !"
4,Serves our purpose,I finally took the plunge and bought a set of All-Clad stainless steel cookware. These are the workhorse for our kitchen but we needed to have a couple of non-stick pans. We did not want to spend a ton of money on them so I opted for this pan based on a review in Cook's Illustrated (was not the highest rated pan they tested but they recommended it)As other people have said the pan is light and thin. You need to be diligent when using. The non-stick qualities are very good. The pan has a nice large cooking surface.Even though it is recommended to hand wash we have put ours through the dishwasher several times with no ill effect.For a supplemental pan it has suited our need. Don't know if this pan is what I would want for everyday use.
2,thin pan,"I should have heeded the reviewer who said the pan was thin. I agree. I thought it was going to be one of those no-nonsense restaurant-style pans with a removable rubber grip and thick aluminum. But not so. The pan is thin, the grip fixed, and is only oven-safe to 350 degrees, which means I can't put it under the broiler. Warehouse stores carry the more industrial thicker aluminum with removable grip for less money than this one was for me on Amazon.Important to note that the instructions with the pan say that ""hard anodized"" is not dishwasher safe, hand wash only."
4,great,"Let me say I was really impressed by these guys. I first heard them at a concert in Indianapolis, which is where I live and where they come from. Most of the songs on this cd are really good, although there were a few weird ones, like ""Top Ten"". Basically, I really liked this CD and I liked the lyrics. They are very moving and ""I Your Boy"" was very powerful for me."
1,Don't Waste Your Time On This,"This book is an example of what it means to be reading the sort of works your opponents write to each other smugly mentioning gross statements of error as irrefutable facts. This pathetic example of anti-biblical writing has brevity as its only and inconsiderable virtue, and is only capable of being enjoyed by those who have little knowledge and little belief in the Bible. The book contains almost no history about the Bible, and is mainly an anti-biblical philosophical tract devoted to minimalism. Even at less than a dollar (sold, ironically enough, by CBD) the book isn't worth its price."
4,Basic Anatomy-Human Skeleton,"This is a great book, I actually use it for class ever single day and I study out of it constantly. And the book I ordered was in great condition and I extremely pleased with my purchase."
2,Disappointed,"The meditations are excerpts from various works, but it's too disjointed. Because they are taken out of context they often don't make sense to me and are therefore not inspiring at all. If I was very familiar with his work and a big fan, then I'd possibly like it. If you're looking for some good daily food for thought or a daily devotional, I'd choose something else."
5,Timeless Wisdom,"For years when I have my morning devotions I would spend time in the Word,Then read a little from C.S. Lewis's and Brennan Manning's Devotionals. This year I am continuing to read The Bible every morning plus Jesus Calling and now also Listening To Your Life and i enjoy it immensely."
2,disappointing,I guess I was expecting a book with more helpful advice and some shared experiences that are deeply meaningful but this book was kind of shallow and never seemed to get to the core of the human dilemma.
5,Great for the money!!,"Great deal, and I bought 2 so I got free shipping!! They are half the price of the same product in most office stores. A little cheap built but what do you expect, and it gets the job done well!! Holds more than I thougt it would. I broke one of the hooks when I was trying to assemble the magnents on the back, but still works good."
3,"Looks good on your eyes, but it's hell when you take it off","I love Maybelline - almost all my make-up is from them, and everything they make has always worked fantastically for me, and looks beautiful, but this was a bit of a disapointment.I wasn't expecting humongous lashes when I tried this, but it didn't make my eyelashes look any longer than they do when I use Great Lash mascara (another mascara brand by Maybelline which is THE BEST). It did look fine, though, just not what I was hoping for.And then when I tried to take it off....geez. Took out at least 5 lashes on each of my eyes, and I'm gentle when I take mascara off! If you have naturally long, thick lashes that grow quickly it may not be much a disaster, but I'm not like that, so that doesn't go too well with me."
5,Soothing and pleasant,"I find it hilarious that some people rated this CD poorly based on the fact that the chants were repetative. Chants are SUPPOSED to be repetative. That's why they're chants. Ideally they would have them repeat 108 times.As the CD is called Om Mani Padme Hum, it's safe to assume that this has different varieties of this chant.This CD is more ""westernized"" in the sense that there is new age music involved in much of the CD. Because of the different music variousions I don't like using all of these for my meditation practice, as I prefer simpler music for that, but they are relaxing nevertheless."
4,Good meditation music,"Very peaceful. Beautiful extrapolations of a basic Buddist chant. Greatest appeal would be to the Western European ear, I think."
2,Completely Westernized,"I had high hopes for this after reading the other reviews, but I was sorely disappointed. In fact, I re-sold this CD on Amazon two days after receiving it.The chants were not only repetitive but so completely designed for Western ears that they resembled Eastern-flavored Muzak. There was no challenge at all to this music; but at least my mother loved it."
4,Not great cinema but fun,"It's about time Universal got these on DVD. These are 6 VERY low budget movies all starring Lon Chaney Jr. They're quick (most run only about an hour) move quickly and have some neat twists. There are plot loopholes and some bad acting but this is still fun. ""Weird Woman"" is definetely the highlight of this collection. Worth getting especially for Universal horror fans."
5,LOVE THIS SERIES,Love this series and if you like old b&w universal mysteries and horrors you will too.Absolute must buy.Get this now.
3,good fun,"interesting specially those who are directed by Reginald Le Borg who shows some kind of flair and has a few good directorial touches. Lon Chaney jr is quite good. It is fun to watch even if it is often predictable. Good prints, nice photography"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"I'm ecstatic to have these all in one set. Great quality and great entertainment. Strange Confession's end title card shows it as a relart re-release. Otherwise, no problems."
3,"Given the low price of this package, these are worth the money","I'm not ever sure I'll watch them more than once, but how can you beat 6 movies for less than $10.They are corny, to be sure. And Lon Chaney's ""whispering"" his thoughts in just about every movie gets really old. But they are enjoyable time passers. The pictures look wonderful, the audio is fine, and unlike many of their franchise sets, Universal used single sided discs on this set."
3,Inner Sanctum Mysteries,"All of these movies rated Three Stars or BELOW. Not really super for horror movies. Other horrors better, and I sued to Listen to Inner Sanctum on the radio when I was a kid! Sorry, but not really very good. Cecy Ivie"
1,INTER SANCTUM MYSTERIES,WAS VERY HAPPY TO GET IT IM A BIG FAN OF LON CHANEY JR BUT 2 OR SO FILMS ON 2 DISC WAS NOT PERFECT - IT HAD A SKIP AND A STILL IN THE FILMS
4,Lon Chaney jr. fun B classics,At this price every Universal horror fan and Lon Chaney jr.fan must have.All the films are fun if not great. Lon shows he could do more than just be a monster. There are 6 movies in this set based on a radio series called Inner Sanctum. I will not go into plots but all are of the mystery genre with a touch of the occult in each.Weird Woman will be of interest as it is based on the story Conjurer Wife which was remade in the 60's as Burn Witch Burn.The price is the clincher you can't go wrong at this price.I have enjoyed this series with repeated viewings. i believe you will to.
4,Another welcome helping of B-movies,"Because I have always had a major soft spot for creepy-crawly B-movies of the 1930s and '40s, and because I was a quick convert from VHS (so ten years ago!) to DVD, INNER SANCTUM MYSTERIES: THE COMPLETE MOVIE COLLECTION is most welcome. And now that we already have the DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, MUMMY, INVISIBLE MAN, WOLF MAN, BELA LUGOSI, and BORIS KARLOFF COLLECTIONS, perhaps next Halloween we'll get MAN-MADE MONSTER (also starring Lon Chaney Jr., with Lionel Atwill in strong support), NIGHT MONSTER (Lugosi and Atwill), THE MAD GHOUL (George Zucco and Robert Armstrong), and HOUSE OF HORRORS (Rondo Hatton and Martin Kosleck) together in another nice set, or the perfectly silly CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN/JUNGLE CAPTIVE/JUNGLE WOMAN trilogy coupled with MURDER AT THE ZOO and THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL."
1,The Title's Funny!,"David Rees is a really talented and funny person from what I've come to understand, so it confuses me that he'd waste his time rehashing a book he self-published years ago. This is not worth republishing. It reeks of a temp worker sitting bored at his desk - It's not funny, and Rees is on the verge of exposing himself as a one trick pony if he doesn't put out something new soon! Never fear! I recently read a short story by david in the Politically Inspired Anthology and it was brilliant. David, what do you say you leave the clip art behind and give us something fresh like that? I'm a fan of yours and feel really ripped off by this book."
1,didn't like it,I really don't like this book. I didn't think it was very funny. Most of it doesn't even make sense. I really can't find anything good to say about it. Sorry...
2,Poor design led to 2nd failure,I bought this quick change arbor to replace the one that came with my Milwaukee hole saw kit. The problem with the 1st one was that the alan screw that holds sets the arbor to the shaft broke. The replacement lasted until the 2nd time I used it. The same part failed on the replacement.
1,Very disappointing,"I love Brazilian music with a passion. So it was with great hope and expectation that I ordered this CD after having downloaded the first cut-Fotografia- from Amazon as a freebee. The CD did not have any 30 second music links to preview so I simply took it on faith that the rest of the cuts would be as good as the first. The singer has what I would describe as that typical Brazilian mono-tonal quality to her voice, a la Astrid Giberto and Babel. Unfortunately this quality, the lack of a full backup orchestra and her attempts to sing in English make the CD almost amatuerish in quality. Frankly this lady just can't carry a tune and it is a shame because the guitar and the paino behind her are first rate, but not enough to redeem her performance. I regret purchasing this CD and apart from the first cut mentioned above the rest is very disappointing. What a shame!"
2,disappointing,I agree that the pictures were too small. It made it too difficult to wade through this book.
3,Fantastic,"Great product very practical and easy to use, but beak is quite tall and structure is a bit flimsy. Only good for pumping not very strong for breastfeeding."
5,An American Musical Icon,I first heard Taj Mahal in 1972. He's made much music since then. If anyone wants an appreciation for the roots of his talent I recommend this CD
5,Property of Spoiled Rotten Chinese Crested T-Shirt,Shirt arrived pretty quick. My girlfriend was very surprised and excited when she got it. There are not too many Chinese Crested T-Shirts around.Would like to see more of a variety of Chinese Crested T-Shirts. Our crested gives this shirt two paws up!
3,"Quirky rather than funny, intrigueing if a bit dated.","Set in California, a man plays a prank on his neighbours by faking a hominid skull in his back yard.The archeological find turns out to hide a sinister truth about the area, an ancient ill that has been forgotten and that threatens the lives of the new residents of the area.Dick's novel is not one of his greats but is certainly worth a read. It is a nice example of how a prank can backfire and end up working for the good of all."
2,"Does not cushion shock of road on my Kia Rio, not smooth ride at all.","Great brand name, lousy ride for 2003 Kia Rio. If you want a more comfortable ride do not purchase if you have a 2003 Kia Rio. Does not smooth over bumps in the road at all. It it just above having no struts at all. Bumps jar you in your seat. Wish I had bought something else but went with a brand name instead. I counted on their reputation. If these struts have a break in period and ride comfortably afterwards then I will re-post this review. Have put over one thousand miles on them so far."
1,Disappointed,The book pictured on your site is a 928 service guide. That's what I ordered. The book I received is a collection of reviews of the 928. Bottom line: I did not get what I ordered. Disappointing read.
1,Garbage ingredients!,"I used to eat these in high school every day to get going quickly before school. Now that we are getting all the high fructose corn syrup out of our house I thought of Tiger's Milk as an alternative to the granola bars in the breakfast isle. Bought TWO boxes. Boy was I disappointed when I read the NEW ingredients that started with, yep, you guessed it, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP!! Then followed by oils of very possible kind. Not what they used to be. Now they are no better than those chewy granola bars packed with stuff I can't even read."
5,Cuts like butter...,"This thing is very sturdy and solid, my black and decker RX-3 rotary has no problem gripping it and the dremel bit has no problem cutting through plastic and wood. I have not yet tried it on metal."
2,"Great Idea, but disappointing...","I like the idea of saving space on my desk and the price was great! I was disappointed, however, by the design. The back of the file is open so papers can slip out the bottom. The papers must be in a folder to keep them from slipping out."
1,BEWARE!!!!! False Advertising!!!!!,"This is NOT a Case of 25 handles. I ordered this item and they only sent me 6 handles!!! The handles themselves are pretty, but not worth the price if you only get 6 of them."
2,don't get the online version!,"If you get the online version of this book, be sure to download it carefully because you only get to download it once. Also, some of the activities (one of the hotel/casinos and many stores in the International Bazar were closed) in Freeport were unavailable when I got there due to Wilma and other recent hurricanes, something the Frommer's guide did not warn me of in the 2005 edition (the 2006 edition was not available when I purchased the online 2005 edition here). Also they did not tell me about ""Smilin Pat Tours"" (at smilingpat.com), and she is one of the best tour guides in Freeport, we saw Freeport from a ""native's"" perspective."
5,The Butter Battle Book,"The Butter Battle Book is a very creative and funny book. It is about 2 countries that are fighting because of the way they put butter on bread. It is a 1 man battle for each side because there is 1 man for the Yooks and 1 for the Zooks. There rhyming,onomatopoeia and coined words."
5,A story of the dangers inherent in escalating hostilities.,This book describes the conflict between those who eat theirtoast butter-side-up and those who eat it butter-side-down.This paradigm for the cold war serves as a useful lesson in peace and as a warning of the risks of 'deterrence' as a defense policy.
4,Butter Battle Book Review,"The Butter Battle Book, written by Dr. Seuss is an exellent display of his own thoughts on the nuclear war. This book helps inform young audiences about our nation's history in a way that they can understand. Although this is a childen's book, it is great reading for all agaes, and really hits home for those who have memories of the Cold War. The disagreement between the Yooks and the Zooks expresses how they both think bread should be buttered. One ""butter-side up"" and the other ""butter-side down."" The controversey, turning into a battle shows Dr. Seuss' dislike for generic disputes. The Yooks and the Zooks hurry to develop more powerful weapons, until; both groups take it to an extreme. The underlying theme to the book is the absuridity of battle. Dr. Seuss tries to convey that people must overcome their pride to live in peace. Memories of the Cold War like the wall dividing the Yooks and Zooks add to the realistic element to The Butter Battle Book."
4,Great Book!,This book is about different people that live on opposite sides of a brick wall. I really enjoyed reading this book.
5,Wars are often fought over dumb things,This is what my 8 year old son got out of reading The Butter Battle Book and that you should always accept peoples differences. It is one of his favorite books and it is timeless.
3,disappointd,I bought this Seuss because it was rated as a number one with NewYork. I thought it was over the top Cold warish and it simplified the problem in a very trivial way. I would not recommend it to anyone and was quit disappionted in the strong political nature of this book. Thumbs down ):
2,Butter Battle -- buy all other Dr. Seuss first.,"All our kids are big Dr. Seuss fans, but unlike most of the others this one fell flat. Published very late in the ""Dr. Seuss"" career, it is as if someone else were attempting to imitate Theodore Geisel's style (which is what I suspect was the case). Unlike ""The Lorax"", an earlier book about another serious subject, pollution, in the ""Butter Battle"": 1) the imagination and creativity are lacking (nothing equivalent to ""Brown Bar-ba-loots"" and ""Truffala Tufts""), 2) the style seems forced (many phrases are adapted from previous books), 3) the author's tone is much more harsh, 4) there is a major continuity problem near the end that confuses both child and adult alike, and 5) most importantly, the writing simply does not flow, making it uninteresting to an average child.My suggestion: leave this until the last book in your Dr. Seuss collection."
1,"Overlong and forced, feels like an imposter.","This didn't feel like an authentic Seuss, just as another reviewer has pointed out... The narrative is stiff, the rhymes lacking fluidity and humor, and the story is just plain dull. Although I have no problem at all with presenting anti-war and anti-arms-proliferation sentiment in a format suitable for a child, I don't think that this book does it well. The overall impression I get is that of a message being sent in the style of Seuss, with rehashed elements, rather than a genuinely entertaining Seuss book."
1,Not appropriate for young children,This is not appropriate book for young children. It's a bit violent with too much political undercurrents. The rhythm and rhyme are off as well. Choose another Seuss book.
1,Very disapointed,"I have trusted in Dr. Seuss since I was a child, so when my 7 year old son brought this book home from the library, I didn't think it necessary to read it before he did. I found the book very disturbing - what message is Dr. Seuss sending our children?"
1,"Like most celebrities, Dr. Seuss is a little too simple-minded","As a writer and a creator of children's stories, Dr. Seuss was absolutely brilliant; there is no doubt about that. But his childish view of of the Cold War, at his age, is unforgivable. Likening the difference between freedom and Communism to the difference between the location of butter on bread is frustrating, and demonstrates once again how our American celebrities are unbelievably idealistic and out of touch with the realities of the world."
1,[....],This book does nothing but mock the all mighty military machine that made this country great. Nothing in this country has done in the past 200 plus years beats the resounding victory we scored against those cold and calculating communists during the Cold War. We beat those commies at their own game. How dare anyone mock the greatest accomplishment of the greatest president we have ever had. This book is nothing but [...] and Marxists Philosophy.
3,Cold war arms race,"This book is a fairly transparent parallel of the cold war arms race. While other Seuss books put more distance between the actual topic and the text of the book, this one lacks that divide. This is not one of the better Seuss books."
3,"Good plot, but too lengthy","I wanted this book thinking that it would be an easy read for my students and future children. I generally love Dr. Seuss books but when I began readying this book, I noticed that the sentences were confusing. I realize that Dr. Seuss wrote many of his books a long time ago, but as an ESL teacher, I don't think my students will understand the story. Many of the words used are tongue twisters. The book is also too long and my students will get bored halfway through.The storyline is great but the book is too long and wordy."
2,Been better books by Seuss....,"This is an interesting Seuss book. The moral that it is trying to portray is good, but the story is pretty lame and it doesn't seem to flow as nicely as most Seuss books."
3,Not worth getting,"I got this book hoping to find advanced tweaks I could make to the Visual Studio IDE, but I'm disappointed. I was hoping to find ways of removing commands from context menus, and making the debugger more usefull and such, but most of these ""hacks"" are fairly basic. Anyone who has used the editor is probably already familiar with much of what is covered. Also, the author did not do a good job distinguishing hacks that are Visual Studio 2005 specific, so I can't even use some of the cooler techniques in the book.This would be better off as a small webpage on basic Visual Studio Tips & Tricks than as a ""hacks"" book."
4,Not a bad book,"Not a bad book, some of the 'hacks' were straightforward that every true developer is familiar with. Others were nice to know. The best 'hacks' however were downlods from various sites...."
5,Comprehensive and highlights New York in a wonderful way,The author brings to life so many sights in New York in such detail. She cross-references sights so you can see how they relate to each other. I did not know that some of these locations existed. This book is useful for the tourist or for anyone that wants to learn about musical New York. The book is divided in such a way that you can pick an area and explore to your delight. She also includes historical facts that are not necessarily known by most people. Highly recommend book plus it is easy to put in your briefcase or pocketbook.
5,Far exceeds expectations,"Each time I return to this book I recognize how many little extras it includes, such as vertical profiles, several ways to find or select a trail, a good place to satisfy post-ride munchies, or the phone number of a local bike shop in a nearby town for an emergency repair.As a 4th generation native of Arizona, I thought I knew my way around, but this book has paid off in directing me to a lot of out of the way trails I never would have found or even heard of swapping ideas with local riders. Do not overlook or underestimate the many ""honorable mention"" rides included in each chapter.There's another popular book on Arizona mountain bike trails that is sort of a cartoon. Buy that if you want laughs, but buy Mountain Bike America: Arizona if you want a serious reference tool to get the most out of your visits to and around Arizona."
5,An excellent AZ mountain biking guidebook!,"This book was written by an Arizona native, so the book has just about all of the information anyone will need when riding in AZ. Each section is packed with interesting history of the area the trails are in, accurate trail descriptions, detailed and accurate maps, elevation profiles, best time of year to ride specific trails, and even a list of accomodations and restaurants in the trail area! At 384 pages, this book is the largest guidebook that I own of AZ mountain biking books. You can even download a sample chapter of the book on Paul Beakley's website... It is an excellent book that I highly recommend for anyone interested in mountain biking in AZ!"
5,White Christmas DVD,DVD was in very good condition and I really enjoyed it. Received the DVD in time to enjoy it over the Holiday Season.
5,He loved it!,"My husband requested this for Christmas and was very pleased at the quality of the DVD, the fact it was not colorized and that it contained two movies. Packaged great, arrived quickly...we are very pleased."
5,Fantastic Christmas Classic!,"I enjoy Holiday Inn over Going My Way, since I have been watching it every Christmas since I was young. They are both fantastic Christmas movies cherished by the entire family. The music in Holiday Inn especially is great, with different songs for each holiday and a great love story to accompany them! Highly recommended to those of all ages!"
5,Sweet Nostalgia,"this book is every bit as good as I remember it to be, and I STILL find myself browsing through its fantastic illustrations and cheering for Shag as he fights every peril that comes his way! A MUST READ for every nature /animal loving fourth grader, this little book has a special place in my heart all these years later!Shag: Last of the Plains Buffalo (The Animal Life Cycle Series)"
5,She really keeps it easy and tou see results,I have tried a lot of work out at home videos and this one is amazing! She makes it easy enough to do and yet you really see results fast. I did this workout switching on and off vidoes everyday and I lost 15lbs in 1 month. I would recommend it if your lazy when it comes to working out.
4,5 stars for the 3 fast miles!,"This is a combination set with 2 DVDs. The first has a 2 miles walk on it with mile markers so you can stop after 1 mile. This is a basic Leslie two mile walk with some intervals of faster moves. The 2 miles take 30 minutes to complete. The second DVD is 3 fast miles and I really like this one. You get the 3 miles done in 35 minutes with a 5 minute warm up and a 5 minute cool down. The pacing is fast and the music is great--probably some of the best music Leslie has on any of her DVDs. Leslie is quite chatty and the whole walk is done with a group of women that you see in lots of her DVDs, plus her daughter and her niece. It's a fun, fast 3 miles."
5,Great Sweat,"I just received this DVD yesterday and could not wait to try it out. Its a great workout and you really get your sweat on. The cueing could have been better in certain spots and I was thrown off by Mary Kay's impromptu lead ( only because it was unexpected and she did not have a microphone). However on the whole, it was a great workout. I love Leslie Sansone and she has definately helped to revive my workout routine. Great Work Les!!! Keep them coming."
4,Not bad but....,"The DVD is pretty good and you will get a good workout, but I feel that Leslie seems way too goofy on this tape.About the dvd itself: There are 2 DVDs with a chapter option so you can select 1 mile, 2mile, etc. The best feature for this dvd is that it has a music only option so even if you are like me and find Leslie to be too goofy for your taste once you get used to the moves you can play it with no voices and only music. The workouts themselves are interspersed with high intensity jogging and low impact fast walking. From the start it moves pretty fast so if this is your first time with the walk slim dvds try to take it easy until you can move up to the higher intensity moves. Also these workouts don't use any extras like the weighted balls, stretchie, or the ab belt so its very accessible for everyone. 4 stars for the good workout but not for Leslie's goofiness... I usually am ok with her chatter but not on this DVD."
5,awesome,let me tell you i have done alot of leslies videos and this one is awesome it is sooooooooooooo much fun to do and you will definetly feel it the next day. i know alot of people dont like to hear her chatter but this one is so much fun to watch because it has awesome music and it is very uplifting. of all her videos this 3 mile one is the only one i am going to use from now on. i used a perdometer and it calculated 5894 steps short of 106 for the 6000 you walk for a regular 3 mile walk. trust me this one is fun.for those of you who cant stand the chatter it has a music only button.
2,A LITTLE OFF HER ROCKER,"I now have seven diff. Leslie Workouts and normally I love them, not so with this one. It seems production was rushed and it did not get any editing as I can see the camera guy cruising by in the background no less than 2-3 times in the two mile walk. Also as other reviews have noted, the two dvd's ARE MISLABLED which shows lack of attention or care. Leslie does not act like herself in these two workouts either. She's way too goofy and out of it, chatting about who knows what while she's out of step and changing things up without letting us know. I tried to do the 3 mile tonight but after just 3 minutes of it I was so annoyed at the program I had to take it out and put in her walk/jog dvd instead. My favorite leslie workouts are Walk/Jog and 3 mile for Abs. They are terrific but this one is not!"
2,Too much talking to Jimmy; Cues were off; Studio dark and dreary!,"Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Leslie Sansone and her workouts are the only ones I can do. I'm sure Leslie wants to hear feedback from her fans regarding her workouts so here it goes: I was disappointed with the Walk Slim Fast Start 1 and 2 Mile DVD workout. I think Leslie needs a better production company. Doesn't Leslie solicit feedback from a test audience before selling her DVDs to the public? The studio was dark and dreary. Leslie was acting too silly and she spoke way too much to ""Jimmy"" practically ignoring everyone else. It really got on my nerves. Her cues were also off. The Walk-Away-the Pounds DVDs are probably the best produced."
3,Try Another Leslie Video Instead,"I have a lot of Leslie's videos and I've always loved every one- until I got this one. I'm overweight and not a big exerciser so it does get me to sweat, but I don't feel that I'm getting a total workout. Her other videos incorporate hand weights and work the arms along the way as well. I feel I've accomplished more at the end of those videos. I also don't like in this video that it gives the option of a 1 or 2 mile walk, but if you choose to stop after 1 mile there is no way to get to the cool down- you just stop in the middle of a brisk walk. Try one of Leslie's older videos and I think you'll be happier."
4,"Informative, well written and compactly descriptive.",A great short book describing a survivors life through numerous concentration camps. It gives the reader a good feel of coming from a life such as any readers to the hell she was forced to endure. A great engrossing quick read!
5,fabulous!,"A wonderful selection of chapters from great books for kids! Sort of like the ""bathroom books"" series for kids, because it offers a glimpse of each story. I also love the wide range of stories, so as a browsing selection it is great...makes a wonderful choice for bedtime reading, classroom booktalks, or group reading"
4,MY 10 YR.OLD LIKES IT,"JUST THE FACT THAT MY 10 YEAR OLD LIKES READING IT, SAYS IT ALL. BEST READER I HAVE FOUND FOR KIDS, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
1,Don't we have more than 10 minutes to spend with our kids???,"come on, guys...can't we spend more than ten minutes each night to read to our children? especially classic books! why not just read ten minutes of the ACTUAL book to the kids so they can truly savor the piece as it was meant to be read. i cannot recommend a book that takes time away from children just so adults can selfishly have more time to work out, pay the bills, etc. this is a book definitely not worth it."
4,dremel cutter,This was a gift for a 16 year old who does wood carving. He hasn't used it yet so don't know how he likes it.
4,HEALING GARDEN JASMINE THERAPY SENSUAL BODY MIST 7 OZ,I LOVE THIS PERFUME AND IT HAS A LOT IN IT! :) IT SMELLS SOOOO GOOD! IT GOT HERE QUICK TOO.
2,Always going off line,"I have had a Max G router for a few years now with nothing but problems. It is constantly going off line every day. When I try to connect, a message comes up saying that it is acquiring network address but it never will. I have to go to the router and unplug it then plug back in to get a signal. What a pain. I have also had trouble with the security settings so I have to run it without an security protection. Are all routers like this?"
5,Sridevi All The Way!,"An interesting commercial potbolier brought above average status by Sridevi's resplendent performance. With due respect to Amitabh Bachchan, Dilip Kumar, and Kamal Hassan, Sridevi is India's all-time greatest actor. Anil Kapoor and Sunny Deol have some very tense moments together on screen- sorry folks, male-bonding doesn't float in the Indian Sub-Continent. Also features the classic song ""Ungli Mein Anghoothi""."
5,Insights into acting Shakespeare,"""Playing Lear"" is an extremely well written and entertaining book. Anyone who loves this play will enjoy learning about it from the point of view of an actor who has played the part. His comments are insightful and interesting and also very useful to anyone interested in acting in any of Shakesepare's plays, not just Lear. I plan on reading it several more times."
2,Incomplete. Misssing entries for common drugs.,Two of the few drugs that I ever needed to look up are not even in this book. Glucagon which is a very common antihypoglycemic for one. The combination antihypertemsive drug Diovan HCT was not even mentioned either. I had to go out and but a second reference to supplement this one.
5,Carbon Relief,"Wow! What a talented group of gentlemen...If you haven't heard these guys...go now and buy the CD Echo Echo...even better...if you live in the area (Richmond, VA) or if they are in a town near you...GO SEE THEM!...words really can't describe how gifted these guys are...finally a breath of fresh air from all of the sticky pop!...as a lover of music from rock to jazz...Carbon Leaf masterfully blends them all...I wish these guys all the best!...a job well done...keep up the excellent work!"
5,Took a chance and loved it!,I heard this song (the Boxer) on Elliot in the morning on DC101 and I love it. I am very cautious about buying a cd when I have only heard one song but I just had a feeling that the rest of the cd would be at least decent. It is GREAT! This guys are talented. I agree that this group is really going to be big. I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes a wide range of music. I think it sounds like a mix of traditional irish music and dave matthews band.
5,Great Framework for Building a Trader Psyche,"Very good material for building the mental framework necessary to maximize trading results. The author's work with SAC provides a great lab to see trading psychology real time. Nice insight and very readable. Trading in the ""Zone"" is a place that is difficult for the beginner to understand, but it should be required reading before real money is at risk. It sure would have saved me money. From the introduction the material climbs in the traders head and speaks volumes about what it take to be a MASTER TRADER. This work, Ari Kiev's Trading to Win and Douglas' Trading in the Zone and The Disciplined Trader, along with Dr. Richard McCall's The Way of the Warrior-Trader should be the required reading for anyone seeking to trade the financial markets."
4,The Zone,"Dr. Kiev and I have worked together in the application of many of the concepts discussed in this book, and I have seen them applied successfully in multiple situations. And, while I strongly believe that each trader must confront the issues discussed in the text through the filter of their own environment and circumstances, I don't know of any pieces within the trading literature that cover this particular set of topics with as much depth or experience-driven insight.More research is needed in the area of trading dynamics, both from a psychological and a mechanical perspective. Dr. Kiev's work here not only is a valuable contribution in its own right, but also raises some interesting and yet-unanswered questions regarding the myriad internal and external challenges that comprise the art of portfolio management."
5,Trading in the Zone,"Trading in the Zone encompasses the most pertinent aspects of money management such as establishing and constantly resetting one's goals, understanding and incorporating a risk profile and cutting losses in the interest of capital preservation. This book is a must read for anyone looking to learn about the tenets of psychology as they relate to money management."
2,Not much use for me.,"I bought it and not much to learn from it. It would not improve my bottom line, This is my opinion."
3,First several chapters are innovative,Felt he could have made it half the length and stayed to more of his psychological point of view. When he goes into talking about trades its just common information vs earlier chapters
3,Take your chances.,"Bought two, one for me and one for the wifes phone.. Mine died in less than 6 months.. And we do not have car charges. Her's still works more than a year later. Take you chances!"
1,uggghhh,I bought this arbor to replace the one that broke with my hole saw kit. It broke the 2nd time I used it. Not happy with Milwaukee's quality so far.
4,Great product and fun read,"This was a great new ""used"" book it came in a great package and preserved to look new. It was a great read and better than described in text...K"
5,best tool,"the hammer that goes with this face is the best tool that i ever invested in. if you have tennis elbow or your arm is sore this is the hammer for you. we think nothing of spending this kind of money on a power tool, but we never spend on our hammer. if you are a carpenter you need this hammer period"
5,Do you want to see my BIG JOHNSON,"Really good tape, will extend almost eight feet before collapse. Buy one and you can ask people if they want to see your Big Johnson."
4,"Best tape yet, BUT","This is my all time favorite tape, despite the outrageous cost. The belt hook system works great. But when the steel tape breaks you are out of luck because Johnson does not sell replacement parts for this unit. When the steel tape finally broke I bought a cheapo tape from Harbor Freight and used the steel tape from it to put in my Big Johnson."
3,Not very durable,"This tape works great for awhile, but then the lock feature quits working. Any professional knows that you need the lock. The lock worked fine for about three months using this tape every day. Then it got weaker and weaker and finally quit holding all together. Other wise this is a good tape. I bought mine when they first came out and it was expensive. Now that I see you can buy them on sale for about 15$ I might try another."
3,cutting tool for detail work,"Performs as advertised. I used it to carve a pumpkin. Not a lot of bite for removing thick/voluminous material, but it's good for detail work."
3,you get what you pay for,"I got these to go with the weed wacker that was given to me. They fit nicely where they are supposed to, but they don't hold up very well. The plastic they are made from breaks off very quickly and I have to replace them 2 or 3 times when I trim the edges of my yard."
1,Cheap junk,"The purple refills they are selling now are worthless and break off very quickly. If you can't find the red refills, toss your Thrasher head and start over."
2,Kinda Cheap,I bough these for my dads weed eater cause we can't find them in the stores anymore - I may have gotten a bad bunch but they break way to easy - work great on grass and thin weeds but break if u hit anything other than that.
1,monster cutters,"These monster cutters are totally worthless. The originals aren't very good, but these replacements are much worse. I was only cutting grass with them and they still only lasted a few minutes. If you want to actually cut weeds along a stone wall, forget it. They won't last 10 seconds."
1,weed thrasher refills,I bought the adapter several years ago and need refills only to find out the quailty of this product is very bad and the new refills could not cut a blade of grass whithout breaking. I would not recommend buying this product do to the poor quality and if you do you will be sorry...
1,"Switch to another system, don't bother with these","These replacement cutters are just garbage. The original red ones that came with my Weed Thrasher system worked great, so I bought some replacements. These snapand break within seconds to minutes while just cutting grass, not anything substantial.Trust me when I say you're going to be better of just getting a new system/head for your trimmer and stay away from Weed Thrasher."
1,There is a reason why you have to buy so many refills...,"The Weed Thrasher is a low-quality product that does not deliver what it advertises. The nylon cutters wear down quickly, prompting you to install new ones far too frequently. I recommend reading the reviews listed for the Weed Thrasher unit. It is simply a waste of money."
1,it was not helpful at all,do not recommand anyone about this product.this is not helpful at alland the document was not come out as it appear in the instruction.
2,Misled,"This book isn't very practical. The information it provides is very airy-fairy and not very rooted. My biggest gripe about the book is that it teaches religious undertones to what I believe to be a purely scientific subject. I don't really want to know about my spiritual guides - I'm not the type to buy into that stuff. That being said, the book does cover the physiology related to hypnosis quite well. I suppose I bought the book with the wrong idea in mind - the title conveys to me a book detailing how to make money and become happy practicing hypnosis as a profession, whereas the book is actually about making money and being happy through the use of hypnosis on yourself."
1,I am not even sure this book deserves it's title,"This is one of the worst books ever written. I am not even sure it can be described as a book on hypnosis. If I have to put a title to this book, it would be ""An anthology of an unassuming human being"". Please do not buy this book if you want to learn anything about hypnosis. It has nothing to do with hypnosis, except part you with your money. I have read virtually all the major texts on hypnosis. Stick to Ormond McGill's books on the subject if you want to learn anything. Anyone giving more than one star to this book is basically being untruthful."
1,Poorly written. Misleading title.,"This book contains some good information, but is is poorly written and poorly organized. There are lots of spelling and grammatical mistakes, making me wonder if the author is not a native English speaker. She also channeled some of the book from her spirit guides, so maybe they don't spell so good in the spirit world. In any case, she should have had a good editor. There are much better books on hypnosis available, so I would look elsewhere rather than buying this book."
1,quackery 101,"I agree with the various other reviews I've seen. Like every other type of therapist out there, Shelley Stockwell is a QUACK!!! I'm not paying $100/hour to lie down thinking that my life will improve. The only practical long-term way to lose weight is to do gastric bypass surgery. All the other ways lead to regain."
1,um PIECE O CRAP,"i wouldnt even give it one star...How dare she think that she can write lies about janet and get away with it. She is exploting INNOCENT people including chat member, j's dancers and friends, not to mention janet her self. As a member of that chatroom and having been present at some of her so called""encounters"" with janet i have to say that she took innocent convorsations and turned them into dirty lies. not to mention her writting SUCKS! 404 pages of complete garbage"
1,Weird as hell!!!!!,"Anyone who reads this book must really have a sad life themselves....this woman stays in trouble here in Cincinnati, Ohio....and was in court telling people that Janet Jackson was stalking her and the case was dismissed. Unfortunately, we have these type of sick humans walking among us that lives in LA-LA Land and can't get a grip on reality...trust me.. I work with one!!!! She also accused other celebrities of ""following"" her....if you seen how she looked, a DOG wouldn't follow her with meat in her pockets!!!! Such a weird woman!!!! I didn't even want to give it a star but Amazon forces it...really it gets no stars!!!!!"
3,Whoa...,"Well, because I'm only about-a little over a third ways through this book and because page by page I have yet to say that I dont like lit-I'm gonna give it a 3 for midways thus far. Because I'm such a Janet fan, I'd LOVE to get this author a big fat 1. But as an aspiring writer myself and because I dont want to seem like I'm (whats the word?) ""player hating,"" I am going to have to be fair (for as far as I am in the book) and give it a midways 3, because so far, I am BLOWN AWAY each page and it could get nothing but better (each page) so I'm am noticing... Now, I will say this however, IF this IS a true story-man-shame on (Janet?) I giggle. But IF this author just conjured up this story-then hell, she's a genius but should be shamed of herself. So far though, from what i'm reading and can tell, shame on Janet. ( I love her though-I just didnt think she had it in her, its just giving me a newer side to her that I couldnt have ever imagined she'd have) But, she's still the greatest!"
3,Size confusion,I was under the assumption that the actual print was 11 x 14. It is actually 8 x 11. The matting was included in the size. It looks a bit small in the prematted frame I have. The quality of the print is acceptable. Amazon was very understanding when I mentioned the confusion.
5,Great shocks- great price...,You can't go wrong buying these shock absorbers. They give a nice firm ride with being harsh. They fit perfectly and are a great value. I recommend them.
5,A Marvellous Gift,This watch is a gift for my wife's birthday .As the day hasn't arrived yet I am waiting for the final response !She knows the brand and model having chosen from the website but the real thing will be terrific ...I hope !The watch is everything she was looking for . Many men's watches have a chronograph design but not alot of womens watches do. This Tissot does and is stylish at the same time.RegardsJohn OckwellSydney Australia

5,I love it!,"For years, I searched for a good fitness solution but I have not found it. I can't go to the gym because it is always too crowded and stuffy air at the gym is not good for my weak lungs. Walking the street or park before work is not feasible, and walking after work is unsafe. The DVD provides the flexibilities that I can exercise anytime I can... in my own home. I actually sweat more with the walking than when I exercise elsewhere. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I bought about 10 DVDs so far to use and to share with family and friends. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT IDEAS."
5,"May be a reissue, but it's one of the best...","for getting a hearty workout in about 48 minutes. The pace is really peppy. No weights or stretch bands are used, but there are intervals of boosted walking. I've been doing Leslie workouts since 2002 and I have about 10 favorites that I rotate through, varying from 3 miles to 5. Even though this one is 4 miles and not 5, the pace is so fast and with the boosted walking I can find this one more challenging than some of her slower-paced 5 mile workouts. If you are ready to take your fitness to the next level, this is a must-have DVD!"
4,Good work out,"I have a few of her walking videos, but I mix three of them. This is one. The video is not that great, but after a while you just get use to it. The workout however is good. I like the intervals in the middle. I feel like I have done something by the time I finish. I would recommend this workout. I am not really advanced, but I am not new to exercising so I wanted something that would be a little difficult. This was perfect."
2,Not worth it after 2 weeks,"I have been doing this video 5 days a week for 2 weeks now. At first it really got me sweating and I could feel the work out. But after the second week, it's boring and way too easy.Walk, sidestep, kick, jog. That's basically it. The fact that they put a ""Music Only"" setting on the video tells you something about how much Leslie feels the need to talk and joke with her kids (CONSTANTLY).It's an okay video for beginners because the steps are easy to learn. But if you are more advanced and want something high impact then look elsewhere."
3,Reissue,"Once again, a Sansone video is repackaged. This appears to be a reissue of ""Walk Slim: 4 Fast Miles (2007).""[...]"
2,Another Sansone Reissue,Once again Leslie Sansone's fans are being duped into getting a Walk At Home DVD that has been reissued. This is about the 4th time this has happened to me. Check your DVD library and make sure you do not already own this. It was orginally issued back in 2006-2007. The DVD deserves more than two stars but as a long time fan of her exercise program that is all Leslie gets without explaining to her fans that this is a retread.
3,Leslie's Other Videos are Much Better,"I have a lot of Leslie's videos and I've always loved every one- until I got this one. It definitely gets my heart pumping and blood flowing, but I don't feel that I'm getting a total workout. Her other videos incorporate hand weights and work the arms along the way as well. Try one of her older videos and I think you'll be happier."
3,Disappointing,"When exercise TV dot com was still online I was able to download Leslie's 45 minute 3 mile walk for free, I think its the best one she's done. She was alone on the floor, still chatty but not as bad as on the two dvds I've purchased and tried so far, and it felt more like having a personal trainer.....more lets get down to business rather than a giggly time with the girlfriends.....maybe I'm just not a 'group' kind of person.I also don't like how the dvds are like a menu of walks to choose from, they seem inconsistent and it doesn't flow nicely....the chatting and giggling are distracting from focusing on the workout. It also looks (and feels) like they were put together from already existing workouts more as a way to make money than to offer something new to the customer.....I was disappointed.I will however still thank Leslie for that fabulous 3 mile walk which has helped me loose close to 30lbs since June 2012! Do more like that Leslie.....serious one on one training."
5,Great workout,"This is a great video. I have many of Leslie's videos and this is my favorite. It's over before you know it. I usually like the mile markers, but with the boosted segments, I don't miss them on this one. Great group with her and great instruction, too."
1,Substance and Form,The content of Leslie Sansone's DVD is good. The problem is that you can only view it on a DVD that has progressive scan DVD. I have three DVD palyers in my house. I can only access it on the Parasonic DVD.
4,Wow!,"I started this workout on Monday and I did it 5 days this week. It is awesome. She uses intervals of fast walking, and jogging. (Which she calls ""boosted walking"") I lost 5 pounds in one wk just from using this dvd. I also decreased my calorie intake. If you are looking for a challenge, but you just plain ol' walking bores you, this is perfect. If you have back problems or knee problems, it is very easy on everything.A must have."
5,4 fast miles,I do t his tape at least 3 times a week. It is interval training and builds up your stamina. It is the best tape to burn the most calories. I love it.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I have the 2 mile walk and love it. I decided to go for something more vigorous, so I purchased the 4 Fast Miles. The 2 Mile has this and I love it. It's right on the screen when you've hit 1 mile and then 2 miles. On the front of the 4 Fast Miles DVD container, it says Mile Markers. While doing the exercise, I could not find one mile marker and had to stop after 30 miles of working out. It is a good workout and keeps you going, but I like to see the mile markers as I go, so I can stop whenever I want and know how far I've gone. This doesn't provide that. It does have different miles you can select before you start, but when I selected the 2 mile, it was already in full swing and rather fast pace. This is not what I'm looking for first thing in the morning. I'm going to replace this with something else that has the Mile Markers."
5,Great video,"I just love this video! I did get sore very badly but that is my fault, i went from doing nothing every day to doing the full walk/jog 4miles and payed for that! But now i am doing it almost every day. It really burns alot or calories. I have never found an exercise video that works me so hard that i can actually finish! I really like the option of just music only. After awhile you just get tired or the same jokes! Also it comes with a 1 mile jog cd as well. I did this and it was pretty easy to, but really works you out at the same time. Love my video!"
3,Nostalgia trip.,"I watched this film when it was first shown on British TV and really enjoyed it. For me it is the best of all the versions of Thief of Bagdad I've seen. Watching this DVD was a nostalgia trip for me but new watchers may be disappointed by the poor quality of the film. It looks slightly out of focus all the time and the colour is dull which is a real shame. In its original state it's a thoroughly entertaining and amusing film for those who enjoy Arabian style fantasy. Yes, the special effects may seem poor by today's standards but don't let that put you off. Worth watching if you don't mind that the film picture and sound quality is poor. In perfect condition I'd give it a 5 star rating."
5,Outstanding tool,"Great tool, it is engineer for wreck havock and destruction (in wimpy terms ""remodelation""). If one wants to let his/her inner destructive self out, one must get this saw and have a hell of a ride."
5,A must have for your car,"These seem very sturdy and are the perfect size to store them within reach in case of an emergency. The light is very bright and they seem like if you ever needed to use it to break the car side window in an emergency, it wouldn't fall apart never to be used again. I don't know that for a fact, but I was surprised at how well built they seem to be. I will feel a lot better knowing each person in my family has one of these in our cars."
1,Get out your musterd guns!,The game is relly E10+ Yeah right!With musterd guns is that relly viloince a real game whould shoot these guys ass.Buy sonic.
1,1# Worst Game In Amarcia,I hate these kids and this game is for babies all you do is run around has 5 stupid kids fighting Adults with Pointlees weapons. One question why is it rated E10+ if it's so babyish? Don't buy this game it stinks!
2,Very poor picture quality,"Don't buy has poor picture quality. Get in hd,I regret buying it, faces are blurry . And this is one of my favorite concert s it's really to bad."
2,it was okay.,"bought DVD. watched first 10 minutes of it. couldn't really get into it. seemed really simple. not for experienced martial artists, that's for sure. maybe a beginner would love it?"
5,"A Rare, And Unique DVD","The teaching style of this DVD is rather unique. It places emphasis on quality over quantity. A lot of videos will show you tons of skills but they rarely spend enough time explaining the finer points. This DVD is different, and the quality shows.All the skills in this DVD are demonstrated in a number of different angles and formats. The concepts behind ths skills are explained through diagrams or close ups.Master Hye Kyoung Kim and [...] put in a lot of work into this. I hope you will this as useful as I do."
5,Wow,"My English class just read this wonderful autobiography of Cynthia Rylant as a class assignment. I truly enjoyed this autobiography; usually I am not such a fan of people telling me about themselves. Ms. Rylant presents her life story in a way that makes her more accessible to her audience. I think that an interesting factor that she incorporated was the quote from the Beatles songs at the beginning of each chapter. I am a fan of the Beatles myself, so that was a strong connection that I was able to establish with Ms. Rylant. Another quality of this autobiography was the way that she laid out the story. She did not write it so it read ""First I did this, then this then that."" She made it a very good read, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in Cynthia Rylant, or to anyone who is looking for a good read. Also, for any of you who have read ""The Giver"" this autobiography might be an interesting read for you."
5,Superb Hendrix playing,"Wow, this one is great.Absolutely great guitar playing like Jimi Hendrix did in the 60's.Their version of All Along the Watchtower is even better than Hendrix and Dylan! Also Little Wing is awesome played. take a listen!"
2,instructions missing!... and something to hang it on the wall,"the dartboard is actually great!.. best quality in dartboards!.... but I got really angry when I realyzed that there was nothing to help you hang it on the wall.. not even instructions, pieces, or anything!...it was a present for a friend, and was kind of awkward to give it that way!"
3,Interesting but approach with healthy skepticism,"I have something of an interest in herbalism but I am not inclined to take everything this author says at face value. He outlines some medical concepts in juxtaposition with principles of traditional Chinese medicine and western herbalism as though there was an connection. However, I do not actually see any connection identified or explained other than by the physical proximity on the page. I am looking forward to trying some of the concoctions and blends listed in the pages but I am going to draw my own conclusions and read some more from other studies rather than rely on the assertions in this book."
2,For the home alone person.,"Not my thing!!! Way to much cleanse and flushing for normal people. This might work for someone that was brought up to not trust the intellegance of a good specialist. Some of these things will do more harm than good, and to start with fixing your ONLY liver, is not the place to be in."
4,Challenging but Fun,"My suitemates and I did this workout as a break from studying for finals. We were all sweating by the end and struggling to replicate the exact moves taught in the video. However, there is a bonus feature on the DVD that shows you more slowly how to do each move in the overall workout. We had a lot of fun, it was like playing Just Dance without wii remotes!"
3,Dance off the Inches: Hip Hop Party,"Hip-Hop Party is just what it says, a Hip Hop Party. Not much to the dancer who has been exercising quite a while."
2,Daughter hated it.,"My daughter was dancing in Hip hop for a couple of years and I thought this would be a good DVD to get her to keep up the practice. However when we both got it and popped in the DVD we both laughed through the entire DVD. She hated it. I did too. The movements were too fast and they were not cued very well. The instructor did a lot of talking and trying to act ""HIP"" she DID use authentic hip hop moves, I was born in that era, but the manner she delivered it was comically. I would not recommend this to a child that has hyper rhythm and then place them in front of this DVD.. it was hilarious. If your child has no rhythm or is challenged then this may be for them. Buy at your own discretion."
3,no step guide in Video on Demand version,"One thing I think buyers should know before they buy is that there is no Step Guide in the Video on Demand version. I suppose if you're a natural dancer it doesn't matter, but I have 2 left feet. One of the reasons I chose this particular video is for the help of a step guide. (I did manage to borrow one, and after that it all worked out)The main video is pretty good. I'm still a beginner, and it gives me a decent workout without being boring or annoying. This is definitely a workout video, couched in fun dance moves. Don't expect it to focus on the music (although there is a music track to it) or on celebrities."
4,My favorite...,"Of all of her Dance Off the Inches DVDs, this is my favorite and the most easy to do with the same results/workout as the others."
2,NOT HAPPY WITH THE WORKOUT AT ALL,"I wish that this workout was labeled for beginngers only. The steps really aren't ""hip hop"" moves - I felt like I was taking a step class at a local gym. The music is awful and is drowned out by the instructors constant chatter. I read many of the other reviews and was expecting a true high energy hip hop/gruvics workout with current music and moves, but for me this workout was easy, boring and dated. I would say to others reviewing this dvd, if you have taken the latest dance workouts, such as zumba and gruvics, you will find this workout disappointing."
3,Good Dance Party!,"Jennifer Galardi is an excellent instructor, and I find this video a good workout. I'm not crazy about the ""sexy hop-hop"" act like a stripper segment, but everything else is fun. Good pacing, so-so music, excellent cueing. This and Galerdi's 10 Minute Solution Fat Blasting Dance Mix are often in the rotation when I'm looking for dance cardio."
4,This is Fun!!,"I really like this workout DVD. Because it is so much fun to do, the time just flies by. Plus, you are learning some cool, fun and sexy moves. I was drenched in sweat after the first time I did it. I can't wait to learn these moves really well so I can get back out on the dance floor and show these off! I tore ligaments in my left knee and broke my right ankle but I've healed enough now to work out and sweat back into shape. Because this is so much fun (when compared to other workouts on DVD) I don't think I'll get bored of it too quickly. I have tried sooooo many DVD workouts but this one is a FUN challenge. I found the 10 minute instructional clip very very helpful!"
1,disk does't work,The Hip-Hop disk did not work. It would start out o.k. and then end up stopping completely. I have sent it back.
3,Just OK,"Truthfully, I'm not the best dancer, but I don't have two left feet either. The steps in this video, for me, even with the step guide, were a little more difficult than necessary. That's not to say that they are very difficult at all- after a while I get it down just fine. I mean that the moves just weren't that fun or that great a workout for all the confusion I was experiencing. I've been to many dance classes that are totally fun and a totally great workout. This is only so-so on both counts.First of all, it's difficult for me to know how to move my body when she's standing toward me in the video as opposed to in front of a mirror like I experienced in classes. This makes a big difference. Second, the music is just not much fun- it feels like cut and dry workout DVD music as opposed to something that will really get me moving. I don't know whether I should have expected anything different, but these were the two things that struck me."
5,It was everything I thought it would be and more!,I love this video I wish the music was a bit more hip but it does the job
5,Great Buy!,I am very pleased with the video. It really provided a great work out for me. It was just what I was looking forward.
5,Great Workout dance video,"The dance moves in this video are actual dance moves, not aerobic moves that someone calls ""dance"". Easy to follow and the step guide is great for any step that you might need more work on. Keep me interested the whole time. I wasn't crazy about the comment about a sexy dance step, ""Do it just like you're taking off your clothes."" Made me feel a bit like a stripper :) But let's hope she meant it in more innocent terms! LOL. Great video, though!"
2,"Boring, and is that really hip hop?","I would give this a big thumbs down. I was not entertained and the workout seemed too simplistic to me. I am not a fitness guru either, but to me, it seemed like my mom with cardiovascular problems could have done this as easy as a walk in the park. The steps seemed more like high school suburban dance studio. The music didn't really seem hip hop. This simply was not high enough of intensity, not the intensity I expected from a hip hop video."
5,Great dance workout!,"I have to say I wasn't sure what to expect from this workout but I'm really glad I purchased it! The dance moves were more my speed and it made it easier, as a beginner, to follow them. For those that find the routine too difficult, I suggest modifying it. You're in the privacy of your home, no one will know. I may not have the most perfect roll or slither but the DVD does it job in getting me a fun and fresh way of sweating off the pounds."
4,A very good sweat!!!,Love this video!!! A very good work out with no confusing moves. I wish it did include music but you have to put your own music on. Make sure ur ready to sweat :)
3,it's was okay,"I got this in the hope that it would help me loose some inches and somehow help my bellydancing(not sure where I got that notion from). However, this DVD is very fast, I would suggest some background in hip hop before attempting this DVD. I even went to the section of the DVD with individual steps, she goes over them once and then speeds it up. It then proceeds to the next step. It's very hard to keep up with. I believe if you have some general background in hip hop however, you may find this DVD helpful and fun. But if your just testing out other dance forms or are a beginner to hip hop, I wouldn't recommend this."
3,Difficult but fun,The product is not great for beginners as there is not enough instruction for the individual steps. I have fun doing it but I have to do it in the privacy of my own home because I'm sure I look like I'm having seizures and not really dancing. You do get a good workout though. I'd buy it for the fun factor but defiantly not depend on it to lose weight because it does not motivate me to want to do it everyday.
2,not for beginner excersizers or dancers,this video has been really hard to get down thet do alot of moves you would see on a music video or something. They break down the moves but i still found them to be pretty hard follow. If you dance to hip hop music alot this would prob be a good video 4 u but i lost intrest
3,Not for beginners,"Great video, but I thought this would be a good for beginners. Definetly not. Try Madonna Grimes' video nd work up to this one if you do not excercise much."
2,not a dancer,"Bought this video in a store - looked like so much fun, said it's for beginners - N O T. The cover made it sound like I could learn to dance and get fit at the same time, but the instructions seemed to be more for people who already had some moves. I've given the video several attempts, knowing that picking up anything new is a challenge, yet I can't seem to make this work for me. I know I'm not the most graceful person, but I was a cheerleader for several years so I'm not completely uncoordinated. It's going back on the shelf... maybe one day I'll give it another shot."
2,Disappointed,"The hip-hop dance moves were very watered down, and the music was not hip-hop. Good workout, just not very fun, it you are looking for hip-hop."
2,"Slow, slow, slow","I rented this on Amazon to see if I liked it before purchasing it, hoping that it would be something I could work into my regular work-out schedule. Unfortunately, after going 2/3 of the way through I had to turn it off. It was so, so slow. The hip action in the middle is sort of fun, but the music is not motivational at all. First of all, the music is not very loud and has a generic beat that sounds like it's played on a keyboard. There was zero bass. Furthermore, the steps were so slow that it's difficult for me to imagine how this is classified as cardio. Very disappointed. I guess it's back to Jillian's 30-day shred..."
4,"Challenging, but very doable after a few tries!","I was tired of the usual home fitness DVDs like Jillian michaels. I needed something fun to kick start my exercise. So I started looking at dance related exercise. This is one of many I purchased. I love this one for the fact I am learning something new, in between the warm up and warm down, there are three separate routines and with the great instructions, you will achieve the dance routine and sweat a bucket! AND it was a lot of fun too, I hardly noticed the time, which I do even with a 30 minute traditional exercise regime. You get to work your core without noticing it and I always hated working my core. I wil love working out with this dance regime as part of my get my ass back to exercising."
3,"Good workout, bad music","It was a good work out, but the background music was so low it was hard to keep rhythm. To me the music is what makes these kinds of videos both exercise and fun. The music choice and volume definetly took away from the experience."
2,Dance Party,I have a few other Dance off the Inches DVD's and this one was crappy! It was unorganized and I felt less than entertained with the music.
5,The ONLY thing that has worked for me!,"I used to be something of a ""gym rat"". I worked out up to 5 days a week! I did cardio all the time! I practically lived on the treadmill and eliptical. I would lose weight, but my stomach never really looked good. Well, this DVD has changed that! I am starting to see definition in my stomach for the first time since I was a teenager! I sweat more doing this DVD than I did running 2 miles! I just ordered the dance of the inches hip hop cardio blast, as I love Jennifer Galardi and truly believe in her methods. I fully recommend this DVD. Don't be frustrated if you can't get all the way through the DVD the first few times u you do it. Just keep at it! It's more than worth it! I will keep you posted on how the new one works for me! I'm excited about it!"
4,Good enjoyable workout,"Dance off the inches is a good enjoyable workable , that you won't get tired of."
4,A really good workout,"I purchased this DVD for my 16 year old daughter. Every night she works out to it and has toned up so well. I have tried it a few times myself but have a hard time keeping up. It really is for the younger generation, but it is fun and much better than just plain exercise."
1,Not Impressed,"I found this hard to follow, boring, and did not get my heart rate up at all. The music was bland."
1,NOT A FAN......sorry,"I didn't think this dvd was fun to ""workout"" with at all. I found myself constantly having to go back to ""learning"" the dance moves and then upon actually doing ""the work out with the moves"", there was more moves not described in the ""how to"" section that were added in! It was difficult for me to follow.....thus NOT A FAN!"
1,Boring.,"I thought the music was slow, the moves were slow. I didn't get a good workout at all, nor did I feel excited to do the workout. I'll stick with Shaun T."
3,weight loss,"The first tape was defective and the replacement flickered and paused at the identical place. However, the substance is what I expected"
2,Hip Hop Aly,"I enjoy doing this lively and diverse exercise routine. I think it is fun and painless, which means I don't feel any aches and pains the next day."
2,Not hip hop; not a party,"I downloaded this video hoping for a workout; it wasn't close to aerobic (I'm in decent, but not phenomenal, shape). It also wasn't instructive (I would've settled for learning some hip moves) or interesting to watch/ listen to (WORST case, I expect some good music and inspiring dancers...but no). C-."
3,Hip hop review,"I purchased this product as a download. I received it quickly! I gave this a three because although I got it fast from the download, I however wasn't able to review the guide steps. By not being able to see the steps, I was lost. I'm a beginner at dancing exercises, and would say this is to fast for my pace. I was hoping I could catch on without the steps, but only got frustrated with it and just figured it wasn't worth the aggravation and haven't went back to try it again. If I had the disk shipped to me and was able to view the guide steps, I do believe I would have liked it even better. If there's anyone out there that has downloaded this product, and knows how to access the steps, please let me know. Good luck to all!!!"
5,Very fun work out!,I was surprised she actually did really hip hop moves. It was a lot of fun and a great work out. My friend and I have done this work out many times together and my friend bought another one of her workouts and loves it. This lady is a very talented dancer. And fun to work out to.
2,Fun . . . ONCE!,"This dvd is definitely hip hop dancing. I just ordered it and did it right away. The other reviews made it sound like the greatest thing. It was sort of fun - very different than other aerobic forms; however, the 3 segments just don't seem like enough variety to keep my interest up and make me want to do this dvd again any time soon. If you like Zumba - many moves are similar."
2,To Fast,"First let me say, I don't have a lot of coordination. So, if you are coordinated then you might want to try this workout. It normally takes me a few times to get the rhythm and the steps down but this video goes really fast and I just can't seem to get it. I have gone to the step guide several times but she doesn't take a lot of time breaking it down and there is not very much time allotted for practicing the step after she shows you. Even the backup exercisers seem to have a problem keeping up. lol."
5,It's a Challenge,Love the video. It's hard though! So if you are looking for an easy work out this is probably not for you.I love the moves. Working on mastering them...
5,Very fun workout!,If you like to dance this is a fun workout. I use it in conjunction w/ using Zumba workout & really enjoy both. My kids like it too (9 & 7 yr old girls).
2,Not What I Expected,I didn't care for this at all. I felt the break down of the steps were done too fast. The music is awful - I wish there were workout videos that actually used music/songs that someone has heard of before! Definitely wasted my money on this. I purchased a couple of Exhale DVDs at the same time I purchased this and I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the Exhale series and would recommend it to anyone!
3,for beginners,"If you're just starting an exercise program or feeling a bit clumsy or self conscious in an exercise class, this video is for you. Once you get the steps down, the routine is pretty basic and the moves repetitive. I've been working out for about a year (spinning, treadmill, powerwalking 3-4x week) so I didn't get the challenging aerobic workout that I had hoped. Ended up adding my own moves just to get up my heart rate. Also didn't know hip thrusts (with attitude!) and funky workout pants qualified this video as a ""hip hop party."""
3,ummm...where's the hip hop music?,"I bought this video because there were so many positive reviews, and because dancing to hip hop seemed like a fun way to burn calories. But there is no hip hop music - just a lame beat in the background. As someone who actually loves hip hop - I was totally disappointed. I think I may just play the DVD on mute and listen to my own music!"
5,hip hop dance workout,Very good workout while learning hip hop dance moves.... sweating off calories while having fun... not a boring workout like some videos
2,this is not hip hop,"I've taken hip hop classes before and I don't think this qualifies. It was a mix between strip dancing and zumba. It did not make me want to exercise and was not fun. It was a little funny watching all of these white women doing ""hip-hop"" but I would prefer something a little more authentic."
3,"Okay, but not enough music and not enough of a work out for me","One thing that I really liked about this DVD was that she was ""mirror image"" to me. When she said go to the left, it was to MY left, her right. It was easier to follow that way.I was disappointed with the music. The music was barely heard in the background. I didn't feel like I was dancing, but just doing an exercise routine.Many of the moves were hard and require practice to get them down right. But I felt there wasn't enough movement. I'm sure I wasn't doing it as strongly as she was, BUT after 45 minutes I was barely breaking a sweat. Worked out with it 3 times to make sure I was doing as much as I could. I still couldn't do all the steps, but it doesn't account for the fact that I COULD have been moving more."
3,Dancing for excersise,"I got the video to excersise with. Realized that I was not that into hip hop, and my knees were hurting from some of the moves, so I gave up the routine, but I can see how someone else would enjoy it and would like it. If you like hip hop, this may be your ticket."
5,good product,great dance moves and fun to exercise too.would recommend for any one who likes to dance.Enjoyed the the way it was made so the non dance can fallow
1,not good as a rental,I really wanted to like this video but without actually having a DVD copy there is no way to navigate. I see there is supposed to be a step guide. This was impossible to follow along with on Amazon Instant Video because there is no way to get to the step guide the video refers to in the very beginning and we are only shown steps a couple of times before moving on. Wish I wouldn't have wasted $3. Gave up after about 20 mins.
2,"DISLIKE! Disjointed moves, bad music, not fun.",Also bought Dance and Be Fit: Hip Hop Cardio at the same time...is much better. Save your $$ and buy it instead.
4,Love it!,"As with all JG's dvds, this is great and one of my favourites. Inspirational music even when I dont feel like moving my body, Jennifer gets me going and feeling great. She's an excellent instructor and I wish more were like her."
3,Not for over 50,"I enjoyed this exercise video and it was fun. But after a few days, when I was starting to get the steps down, I started doing the hip rolls for the stomach muscles and had real problems the next day. My back was so out of whack that I wasn't able to exercise at all for two weeks. Maybe this is true just for me, but I'd say ""beware"" if you're over 50."
4,Gets me back to basic dance moves...I love it.,"This video is done very well. The music selection could be better and a little louder..I get into my own moves as well with the freestyle part. It gets you moving and is easy to follow. I am a natural dancer, maybe not so easy for others. But the basics are shown step by step and you can repeat until you ""get it"". It's a fun and diverse way of working out. I am pleased."
3,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,Based on the reviews I was disappointed. I only use this DVD twice and I use Shaun T's DVD's every day.
2,"oh, well",I was so excited to try this because I used to be in a dance academy and had the greatest workouts there...now that I live further from the academy-I can't attend. So I got this video. This is no work out at all. Doesn't even come close to making me sweat. But oh well....
2,BORING...,"I did not enjoy this video and I doubt I will ever use it again. I bought it because it got decent reviews but I am disapointed. Its slow paced, boring and shes annoying...lots of dull comments. I am just a beginner and couldnt break a sweat.I also bought a video from Madonna Grimes and its fantastic...so dont waste your money on this one...Im just glad it was cheap."
1,"Boring, non-hip hop, too easy even for non-dancer me","Of all the exercise DVDs I've bought (way too many, I have a whole pile of them), this is my least favorite. Boring. Boring. Boring. Ever want to do hip hip to elevator music? Then buy this DVD!I'm quite a bit overweight and rather out of shape, and somehow this DVD didn't get my heartrate up. Bringing groceries in from the car gets my heart going, yet somehow this dancing didn't.So, to sum it up: If you'd like to learn hip hop with a bunch of middleaged white women to the most boring music on the planet, buy this DVD!"
2,Hip Hop Party?! HA!!,"I have yet to get through this entire video because I just can't get into it. Yes, I'm getting a workout, but it's far from being a ""Hip Hop Party"". First, the ""music"" they play in the background is bad beat loops. I realize they probably can't use actual hip hop songs, but could they at least work with a producer who can give them decent beats to use. Then there's the instructor with her ""are you serious?!"" comments - ""put a little bit of that urban shoulder into it""; ""you can throw me some face...whatever you want, cuz it's all about your ATTITUDE"". I'm expecting ""like, oh my gawd becky"" to come out of her mouth any second. Lastly, the choreography is ridiculous! The ""sexy"" segment makes me feel anything but sexy. I feel like a goon doing these moves. If anyone tried these moves outside of their living room people would stop and stare...and probably laugh."
3,Too easy,I was looking for something fast to make me sweat because I just had a baby however this dvd was way to slow for my taste. She does a good job but I was looking for fast pace and more upto date hip hop moves and music.
4,Gets me moving!,I hate exercise but love dancing. At 53 I am out of shape and have lots of aches and pains so I wasn't sure if I would be able to do this. I picked this one because of the reviews about having good instructions. I'm loving it! I don't do all the moves like the young ladies on the video but it gets my heart rate up and puts a burn in my thighs! I'm actually surprised that walking causes pain in my hip and down my leg but I don't get any pain from this. It's the first time in a long time that I don't have to drag myself to do a workout and I'm starting to lose weight.
5,Finally!,"Finally! I have finally found a workout that i wouldn't be embarrassed if my husband caught me doing it. The moves make you feel like your in a music video, and the music stays stuck in my head all day. I really loved the incorporated different parts of the world into the dancing the most. It had a very sexy and modern feel. I have many many dvd's which will soon be collecting dust for a while. Jennifer has become my fav instructor. She does such a thorough job leading you into the next steps verbally so you don't have to rely visually to keep up. This way you can really get into it! Since purchasing this dvd, i have ordered all of Jennifer's dvd's. I am a huge advocate of dvd workouts. My friends always take my word on dvd workouts, since i have lost 60 lbs in one year without going to the gym once. Thank you Jennifer for making such a fun workout!"
5,Dance off the inches Hip Hop Part,This tape is fun. Very easy to follow. I have definately noticed after a few weeks not so much losing weight but I believe inches. My pants fit differently. Makes me more motivated to do this
5,Perfect for a rainy day!,I have to say I totally love this workout. Jennifer is my all-time fave instructor because I understand the way she cues and the way she moves. Her smile doesn't look fake and she looks like she enjoys what she's doing. I have a lot of exercise dvd's in my collection and this is one I use when I have a day when everything just sucks. It makes me move and it makes me feel so much better about myself. I love the moves - they feel new and can be a little challening at first - and I want them to be. Once or twice a week it fits perfectly in my routine. Buy it if you like Jennifer's other dvd's (or any other Dance Off The Inches or Prevention-dvd's) - you'll love it.
5,7 Years Later,"Ten on Ten was a book from my Writing Composition class during my 1st year of college. Recently I picked it up again just to read something to pass the time. I have to say, that it's a fun book. The essays are around 20 pages each, so you can read them in a single sitting. For a book that you can buy a used copy of for under $5, I say it's well worth it. You will probably enjoy it more if you are buying it for fun as opposed to if you are buying it for school."
3,More worn than I expected,"Even though the interior didn't contain markings, it was not in the condition as posted."
2,May as well just listen to the C.D.!,"I love Marvin Sapp, don't get me wrong. I play his c.d.'s over and over and over. So much that I thought what better than to see him sing live.. I know this is gospel but Marvin brings nothing to his stage performance. The Rev. James Moore was a joy to watch on video even in his latter years when he was going blind. Sorry, but Marvin has no stage presence."
5,rare book on a serious subject,"The book talks about things usually discussed by conspiracy theorists - global elites and their attempts to influence world history. The book is written in plain English and with a good deal of common sense. Importantly the author tries to look at the history of the 20th century form a spiritual point of view, particularly that of anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner. Therefore readers familiar with anthroposophical terminology would benefit more from the book. Another strong point of the book is that it contains an actual map used by elites in preparing the World War I as well as maps having to do with our immediate future."
5,Adds significant insight into Paul's letter,I use the Ryrie Study Bible (New American Standard Version) and have found Shepherd's Notes really enhances my Bible study.
2,The Woman in White,The producer has taken artistic licence a little too far. Miss Halcombe was called Miss Fairlie. Why? The earlier BBC version was much better and accurate.
5,worked as intended,"This kit did exactly as it should. Took just a little bit of work to put it in, and worked perfectly."
1,WARNING 2011 f250 leaks from factory tank WARNING,While an excellent idea it will not work on a 2011 f 250. fuel will leak from factory tank while on the road or static. i can only speak for the my pickup. i am sure their are those with similar problems that have never said anything. do yourself a favor spend the extra money and buy a pump.
4,It Works,"Received in a timely manner, well packaged. Installation was simple and easy. It works as advertised. Price seems a little high for what you get, but again it works. Installed on a 2002 Ford F350."
2,"OVER PRICED, DOES NOT WORK AS ADERVERTISED","Easy to install, over filled my primary tank to the point when i opened up the primary tank cap fuel came gushing out. I went ahead and installed a elec. 3 way valve that uses gravity. Now it works great"
3,RDS Auxiliary Fuel System,"Some of the components were low quality (clamps and valve). After installing, within 100 miles, the truck gas gauge went to ""E"" with a warning (auxiliary tank full). Removed the cap to inspect and fuel overflowed. Immediately shut off the auxiliary tank and issues returned to normal - I think. I am reserving judgement."
3,"Barry is a see-thru manipulator, but he's entertaining.","Reading this book was like drinking an effervescent cola beverage. Sugary, sweet, but totally devoid of substance. However, we all love a litle bit of junk food every now and then, and this book fulfills the craving for a fun and easy-to-read story. It's a good plane book and I would definitely recommend it to high school teenagers."
5,A Pause That Refreshes,Scat is someone whom you can identify with. 6 is the thinking-man's temptress. Together they provide the dynamic for the ultimate marketing satire. The final commercial/movie wasn't revealed. That's the only fault. Otherwise it flows as fast and is refreshing as a cold coke from the bottle on a sultry summer afternoon.
4,Light and entertaining,"Max(x) Barry has a lot of fun, and even a little soapbox, in this tale of marketing and branding excess. Highly readable, albeit with an ending that could have been a little more developed."
5,Rip-roaring funny,"I stumbled upon this book by accident and am so glad I did. SYRUP explores the world of Marketing, and specifically the pursuit of success and fame via the protagonist's idea of a great new soda.The story is written cleverly and the prose is wonderful to read--easy and funny (maybe a less intense Chuck Palahniuk). The book is broken into tight vignettes that move the story along at a marvelous pace.This is a super first novel and I can't wait to read Barry's next work."
5,As sweet and refreshing as its title,"A warm, quick, wonderful book filled with likeable characters, cut-throat, mean snakes in the grass, and delight spilling from every page. A true sensation....How's THAT for marketing, Mr. Barry?"
5,Concur,Gripping. Hip. Addictive - read it straight through in six hours last nite. Good thing I can catch a few winks here at work...
4,An amusing look at the evils of marketing,"""Syrup"" takes all the perils of the corporate world and throws them upon its self-named hero, Scat, one by one. Whether you've worked in the field or dealt with it from another department, you'll appreciate the dark humor that paints marketing as the most evil of professions while simultansously glorifying it. The finale is a bit weak, but the zany events leading up to it make the story more than worthwhile."
2,"Give me a break, people!","For outsiders to the world of Marketing who think this is some kind of quick-witted expose on how things ""really"" happen . . . well, shucks, that couldn't be farther from the truth, people. This is Marketing doing a Marketing job on itself! Think infinite regress! I found Syrup to be a barely-readable, gimmicky, LA imitation of Jay McInerney. Gimme a break. Kudos to Barry for cashing in but I won't be running to the bookstores for his next novel (if ever there is one)."
3,"Fun, fast-paced, & fizzy!","[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]Scat almost gets rich developing a new product for Coca Cola, but his idea gets stolen! A very light read, but you care about the characters. Longer review at ImpatientReader-dot-com."
1,Just a bad book,"To me the only clever thing in this book are some of the dialogues. But the premise and plot are too unreal and shallow. The book is set in ""real"" environment (existing company etc.) yet the events are so superficial and removed from reality, it gets annoying."
2,makes me want to drink Pepsi,"I'm mystified as to why why friends thought this was such an awesome book. There were a few funny moments but I didn't think it was brilliant. I found the use of the occasional Australian slang word really distracting and the whole concept to be, well, stupid. And hey, I'm all for satire -- and I have a sense of humor, too. But I just didn't think this book had a lot of fizz."
4,"Well written, faced paced & enjoyable","This is the 1st Maxx Berry book that I have read, and I must say that I was impressed. The book is short and sweet - filled with subtle humor, and keen observations about marketing and human nature."
5,Mktg,I think it's a toss up between this one and his book Company for my favorite Max Barry book. Very enjoyable. I couldn't stop reading.
2,"Learn the rule of threes, Maxx","This book is an annoying read. The rule of threes in fiction states that after the same behavior is repeated twice, the third time needs to be a payoff. But there are no payoffs here. Scat is rendered homeless at least four times, is snubbed dead by the ladylove who hates him but really loves him an equal or better number, and is betrayed in various configurations more times than I cared to count. The overall effect is a bad deja vu where the lead never learns a thing. People can be stupid and dense in real life, but Barry's protagonist really pushes the edge of how much idiocy one person can be capable of. And with me, it crossed the line. Two stars is more than generous."
1,Deeply unfunny,"Really awful book. Maybe I'm not as easily amused as I thought I was.At least I learned a lesson about blindly trusting Amazon reviews. They have served me well in the past, but not this time!"
1,"dull, dull, dull","I looked at several customer reviews before reading this book. Ick! Did they get it wrong or what? This book is awful.Let's start with the pretentious, stupid name of the lead female character, 6. Now, ha, ha, that's funny. And, then there's her competitor, @. Gee, that's hilarious also.Interspersed throughout the book are marketing ""rules"" that are supposed to provide profundity. Duh. If you don't know this stuff already, you probably also have difficulty walking and chewing gum at the same time.Reading this book was kind of like taking the bus to Baton Rouge--endless and slightly sickening."
1,Blunt Blades,"I have used these blades now for about two weeks they don't cut close or smooth(changed blade every day) I thought it was me till I went and bought newer blades from CVS, they give a closer shave with less dragthe blades look the same and all the packaging is standard but the blades do not cut close or smoothly.IMHO"
2,zojirushi has replacement parts on its own website,You are less likely to get the wrong parts. And its price is even cheaper.
5,Good direct replacement,the original paddles wear out and will not spin after a while. Went through two sets already. I ordered three from here and they fit the machine as expected. This vendor was very inexpensive. Fulfillment of order top notch.
3,loose paddles due to use,"If like me your paddles are loose within the pan, be aware. I thought that the center holes of the paddles had enlarged and worn out. This is not the case as these new paddles made no difference. The paddles are still loose and have a lot of back and forth ""play"". I am now assuming that it is the ""stems"" that extend into the holes on the paddles that must have ""rounded off"" due to use. It appears the only way to fix this would be to buy a new baking pan that has the paddle ""axles"" attached."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"By the time I finished watching this, I wondered ""why""??? Maybe not the worst movie I've ever seen, but right down there near the bottom. It was really downright silly. Has there ever been anything in real life close to what this is? Not that I know. The acting was just o.k. The setting was preposterous, especially when you find out that the ""blind beast"" did most of it himself with a little help from his obsessed mother. Of course there was a long tradition of Japanese mothers spoiling their male children. Probably why they grew up exploiting women for the rest of their lives! This movie was not a good purchase."
3,Family Historical Legacy,"For those interested in heritage and the history lessons that are passed by mouth through family gatherings, A Will of My Own, the memoirs of F. William ""Bill"" Broome, is the book for you. Historical events of the twentieth century as lived through the common American family are brought to perspective and given relevance beyond textbook statements. Events include the great Depression and World War II.Broome captures legacies of the old South from his native Georgia. His wit and humor stir the events of his outlined life from early childhood to senior citizen. The memoirs are mostly reflections, and circulate around personal life in the midst of deep political changes. They are at times dry and drawn out, but would be fully appreciated by any family member.Stephanie S. Sawyer, author"
2,Don't fit in Keystone wall plate,"Had to take a blade to the wall plate to make it fit (tried 3 different ones first)I eventually got it installed, took an hour!, the push connections are very difficult to use, should have been screws, or better yet a female plug. Unfortunately the only mono version I could find for the Sony IR blaster."
3,Somewhat dated and biased,"The primary difficulty in any kind of digital photography handbook is how rapidly the technology is changing. This book, published four years ago, but probably written five years ago, is a prime example.There is some good basic knowledge here for those who are entering digital photography for the first time, but newcomers to the technology are probably not going to find any of the finer features of their cameras mentioned at all.Coupled with the strong bias toward Nikon cameras by the author, someone with a strong affinity toward another brand - Canon, in my case - will not find support for non-Nikon features except in passing.My suggestion: get a more up-to-date book, perhaps one dedicated to your favorite camera."
4,Excelent Score - Production not as good as NY,"This CD contains the full score for the show - several songs which were not on the Broadway Cast Recording in thier entirety are present. The production quality of this CD, however, dosen't hold a candle to the NY."
4,Best Score For 1990 Indeed!,"David Zippel's wry lyrics and Cy Coleman's beautiful jazz are a potent combination. Among my favorites are ""With Every Breath I Take"", ""All You Have To Do Is Wait"", ""The Tennis Song"", and ""You're Nothing Without Me."" Right from the beautifully orchestrated overture (with those four fantastic scat singers!) this CD will have your attention. I saw a local college production of this show and it made me appreciate this recording even more."
5,Great performance!,This is outstanding performance !I love his tender but passionate play.How lucky I am to get this dvd!I will keep watch his growth!
1,Unradical Robots,"A plot that makes no sense, big bare chested women getting murdered, Satan having sexual intercourse with a robot, a radical robot sword fight. If that's what you like in a movie by all means purchase this film. All of what I have mentioned sounds extremely awesome doesn't it? Heed my warning, this is one of the worst films ever created. There are only to cut away scenes in the whole entire film and seeing them used over and over again will involuntarily make you vomit."
1,I should have known,"Just by looking at the ""stars"" names I should have known that this was not going to live up to the encouraging blurb for the movie. Yes, I suppose it is a detective movie where they are tracking down a serial killer. However the detective, his partner and the serial killer are all robots. Not even cool, neat, wow special effects type robots. They are plastic, can't move other than their mouths robots. I am guessing someone had a lot of fun filming the robot scenes in their basement. The ""kill"" scenes were all the same. A woman (frequently topless) is shown, oblivious to her impending doom, she then sees the killer (we do not), screams, and dies. The whole thing takes usually takes about 20-30 seconds. The rest of the movie is some dreadful dialog between the detective and his partner."
4,Good value for the money,"This is the second one of these portfolios I have bought. I lost the first one, so I didn't want to spend too much for a replacement. It looks nice and holds most of the material I need. The only drawback with it is that the pocket for business cards does not hold them securely and if the portfolio is slightly open and upside down the cards slip out."
3,So this is bamboo?,"For some reason, I thought this product would look different. The ""bamboo texture"" does not go all the way through. That is, when I cut on this board, the knife marks etch out the bamboo pattern on the wood. The pattern is only knife deep! So upon cutting the first item, it gets ""scratched."" I may be the only consumer in the world that did not understand how bamboo wood works, but I doubt it! On a positive note, the block is exactly the size and dimensions I expected, and I have ""no other"" complaints other than the above."
2,Scratches easily,"Heavy, nice-looking; however, after using one time, there are scratches in the board. The board came shrink-wrapped with a paper insert. The paper insert is glued on and cannot completely remove the stickyness."
5,Just Right For Small Jobs,"The board is lightweight. At 6 1/2 inches square, it will fit easily into your smallest drawers. The bamboo pattern is beautiful.I use one side of the board for chopping (I have some serrated knives which scratch the board) and the other for presentation, to preserve the bamboo pattern.UPDATE: The MIU sticker is hard to remove. I purchasedUn-Du Adhesive Remover Low VOCto remove it. It did not leave any smell. But it did cause a small part of the board to warp. Note: this sticker is on every single one of their boards, regardless of size.After I removed the sticker, I usedJoyce Chen's Bamboo Wood Oilto protect the board. This is recommended in the board's care instructions.I use this board a lot. It is easy to reach for, and easy to store. Buy this one!"
5,Great little cutting board!,"We use this on ""the bar"" for cutting lemons and limes. It's a great size for that function and because this board is attractive we don't feel the need to put it away after use."
4,Great Step Stool if You're Tarzan,"The construction of the Cosco World's Greatest Step Stool is excellent. My only fault with it, which may not be a problem with many, is that it is much, much heavier than the description makes it appear. I would say this ladder is probably close to 20 lbs.I keep this item in my garage unused, and purchased a small 4 foot ladder at my local Home Depot which is truly lightweight (about 7lbs).The description should state the weight and not leave people with their own personal definition of ""lightweight""."
4,Good Product but could stand some improvement,"I love this work platform except for one thing. One of the utility drawers slides down when the product is closed and when you try to open it, the drawer prevents the platform from articulating correctly. You think something has not been unlatched when it's really just this stuck drawer. Otherwise, it's great. Will probably end up taping the drawer with duct tape just to keep it from being a nuisance."
5,great gift,Our son loved our ladder that was similar to this one so we bought him one for a gift. We like this one even better!
3,Better have a couple months before you order this one!,The saw is functional and does what it is supposed to but the time it took to get it here was TOTALLY unsatisfactory. The fact that Amazon split the shipment between two manufacturers made this even more evident. One site shipped the same day and we got their part (the arbor) within the two days (GREAT JOB btw). The guys who shipped the second part (the saw) took their sweet time for whatever reason and we ended up having to find someone locally who had the saw that we could borrow to take care of the project. Now we've got the saw - it works fine - but we were REALLY disappointed that it took so long to get.
4,Great Story,I have read the first two books in this series and enjoyed both of them. I am planning to purchase the third one soon. Great moral and Christian values enforced in the books and kept me looking forward to what would happen next.
5,Unforgotten,When I received Book 1 on the daily Pixel email....I had to order Book 2 and 3. Loved the series.
5,Great book,"This series is interesting and very well written. I had never read anything by Ms Heitzman before and I will definitely read more of her works. The storyline is gripping as we feel the angst of a man trying to follow God's leading even though he may lose people dear to him. Experiencing the tenuous beginning of a journey of faith by the heroine is something most of us can identify with. Beyond the spiritual message, this book is a gripping tale of how our families past can shape our future. I am about to start the last book in the series and I can hardly wait to see how the lives of Lance and Rese are progessing."
1,0 stars-DO NOT RECOMMEND,Don't bother buying this book and Secrets.It was disappointing read Rese the Herione was cold as ice while Lance was a warm and understanding Hero.He needed someone who had feelings and warmth and she was not it.
4,Good but a little confusing,"This sequel to Secrets took us from Sonoma California to New York, and I did enjoy reading about New York since I have never been there. But the book was a little confusing in trying to keep up with all of Lance's family members. I also could never figure out if Lance is suppose to have super Godly healing powers? It just wasn't clear. Also, got lost reading about the ""vendetta"" and mafia, etc, but was so happy with the way Lance settled the vendetta. The ending was a bit strange, but I do want to read book 3 in this series, especially since they are back in Sonoma. I picture that being so beautiful. Thank you Ms Heitzmann for the pleasure of reading your great books!"
4,Unforgotten,"I would have given it 5 stars, but it goes back and forth so often beween his story and his Grandmother's that sometimes it was harder to follow. It was done well though."
3,Lance the healer,"Lance seems to try to heal everyone, take on their problems. This isn't reality, but maybe it is in the typical New York Italian family. If so....wow. Liked the whole series, but each book was really long compared to other trilogies I have read. Still would recommend it."
4,The middle book,"This book continues the problems between Lance and Rese. It seems that taking his friend Rese home to meet his family is a good idea until his grandmother, Antonia, has another stroke and he feels he must take revenge on a Mafia family who he has discovered was responsible for killing her husband. There is a lot of angst as he tries to reconcile this family obligation with the teaching of his chuirch. Rese leaves to go back to Sonoma after he tells her he can't marry her after all.Most of the problems are finally resolved and he goes back to Sonoma, taking his recovering grandmother, not knowing if Rese will let them live in their restored house or even if she will be there. We are left waiting for the third book to see how it will all work out."
4,Excellent,I liked the storyline although parts of it seemed to drag a bit. I was disappointed that the series was over.
3,somewhat uninteresting,A bit slow and the story line is a bit off. The ending leaves you hanging but the book just sort of ends. I purchased this one based on reading the forest one on free ebooks but will not be buying the thief one in the series probably just more of the same.
2,slow and disconnected,I found this was difficult to follow; back and forth in time. This was not as interesting as the first book.
2,Hyped up by first book...,The first book was brilliant.. this one = dudsville. Sucked into buying it after loving the first book. Not even tempted to get the rest of the series :(
2,I couldn't wait for this book but I was so disappointed a the end.,"I absolutely love everything Kristen Heitzmann writes. The beginning of this book was wonderful, the last half of this book was terrible. She took the wonderfully developed characters out of character and didn't finish the story of the other characters. The way this book ended disturbed me. I was so disappointed!!!This book could have been AWESOME! This book could have been a wonderful testimony of Star's salvation! But instead it turned to vengeance and some wierd magical occurance in the end. I will still read Kristen Heitzmann but I did not like this book!"
5,Michelli Family Series Book #2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It highlights the personal struggles all of us face to one degree or another and foremost, God is given His special place where He protects and heals us of the wounds life inflicts. If you love God and love to read about His saving Grace, I think you will enjoy the stories of the personal struggles covered in these books. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. God bless!"
3,Good but not excellent,"The first half of the book was GREAT. No complaints. However, the second half left much to be desired. Unlike her other books, I don't feel like she finished this completely. She left us wondering what happens with all the secondary characters she introduced (some within the last chapter) and Lance and Rese's plans. I hope there is a sequel to this...it would be nice to see the plot go a little further."
5,Wise and Weird,"This book was so witty, in addition to being loaded with good ideas. It was even a sociological study! I could not put it down. I spent the wee hours of January 1, 2000 in the ER (with a husband suffering from a kidney stone) and I took ""Thrift Score"" with me. I would advise anyone to do the same!"
3,It's ok ....,"This book is OK. If you are looking for a nice guide on where to thrift and how to do it, this is good for you. Unfortunately, since Al Hoff writes a zine on thrifting, a lot of times this book reads like one. It is confusing and it jumps around a lot.I like the use of pictures, and I like the different chapters. She organizes each into a room of the house (like the kitchen). She brings us good ideas and great tips on thrifting, but like I said, at times, the reading can be hard. Maybe if your interested, you should check out her zine."
5,A Great Book for Young Travelers,"If you're trying to prepare a young child, or one with Learning Disabilities, for their first airplane ride, this is the perfect book. The illustrations are fun yet accurate, and you can take it on the trip to help your children understand what is happening around them (be sure to read it aloud to them several times and interact with them, if you can. I strongly recommend both this book andAirport"
1,"YUCK, YUCK, YUCK!","Typical 'Black' movie with all the usual drama. Blacks are portrayed as whores, pimps and dogs...again! It would be nice to rent a movie with good acting, good drama and a good ending. Not all blacks sleep around and don't know who their baby daddy is. This movie is about men tired of women wanting child support and questioning whether or not the child is theirs. 3 different scenes with basically the same plot except for a twist on the Mexican family. Black women according to this film are nothing but whores trying to get men stuck paying child support for children that aren't theirs....blah, blah, blah. 3 children and 3 different daddies; typical black man unemployed and living off his woman and tripping when the house is burned down and he has no place to go because he doesn't want a job. Typical vulgar mouths from the males and females. No decent conversation heard. Bad movie in my opinion. Could not recommend."
2,"GARBAGE, JUNK, STUPID","WORSE MESS EVERY. A WASTE OF MONEY, TIME AND MOVIE.Why would anyone take the word of a female and not check this outfor themselves. Women lie about whose the 'baby's daddy'. Men have lost careers over this, and this is no different.Never take the word of a woman about being pregnant. have a blood test taken to see if it is yours, or you will be stuck for the rest of your life with someone's else babies.In some states, they don't care, they will make you still pay for them, saying you are theonly father they know.That is A STUPID LAW, AND I WOULD MAKE SURE WHATEVER STATE I'M IN TO CHECK THE LAW ON THIS ISSUE IN CASE THIS HAPPENS.MEN - you don't have to give up your sports or any career because some female said she's pregnant by you. That is too fast in a few months. She's looking for a 'free ride' and baby daddy to pay her.WOMEN ARE TRICKEY. HAVE YOUR OWN PROTECTION. NEVER TAKE HER WORD SHE'S ON BIRTH CONTROL. THEY LIVE TO GET A FREE LIFE FROM SOME MAN.I'M SORRY I BOUGHT THIS."
4,"Good battery, Good deal","Put these on a subscription and got a really good deal. With all of the games and remotes that need AAA batteries, I never have to run out again."
3,Got some bad batteries,"I bought a 24 pack of the AAA Duracells at a big box store and they had less than 1/2 charge. I ended up throwing them away. I bought them to use in my insulin pump, so batteries going dead is not a good thing.Never, ever had this problem before with Duracells, but maybe beware of buying them at a discount in the big box stores."
4,The difference between junk and junque is...,"... junk is stuff you should throw out and junque is what it becomes through Mary Randolph Carter's eyes. Yes, this makes a trio of ""junk"" books, but her approach is infectious, humorous and fun. She is clearly setting up faux scenarios, not telling us how to live with old rusty flour sifters! There's food for thought among the frolic. If you believe the keys to understanding a civilization are in its flotsam and jetsam, you will learn a lot about 20th century America here. And there's plenty of good advice about flea marketeering, how and where, etc. In fact, after lapping up each chapter, it's all I can do to keep from hitting the road! P.S. Thank you, Mary, for not finding MY favorite junque spots!"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"As a collector of old but inexpensive kitchen glassware and dishes, I expected to find photos of and sources for locating such items here. But the title of this book is in fact an accurate representation of its contents. The items featured are TRULY junk--peeling, shabby and often garish in appearance. There is an honest charm about this and the look can be used to good, even great, effect, but as often as not the result is simply cluttered and unappealing. If you want your own kitchen to literally resemble a flea market, this book could be a great inspiration to you; otherwise you might want to pass, or at least investigate it more thoroughly before purchasing. I wish I'd bought $30 worth of Swanky Swigs instead!"
4,NOT for pencils or pens,"Even though this product states that it is made as a ""Pencil Cup"", it is far too tall to conveniently house pencils, as the cup is as tall (or taller!) than all of my pens/pencils! And, even though this product makes it clear that it is a ""Super Cup"", you may also not realize just how much of your desk real-estate this thing takes up due to its very large circumference..."
3,Not impressed,"Wow, I hate to be the lone voice of dissent for this product, but I really didn't find it all that moving. Arkenstone is one of my favorite new age composers, but this CD lacked all of his usual creativity.Most of the songs sound almost exactly the same. One at a time, they are very nice - taken all together, and it's just plain boring. The pace of the music throughout is slow - there are no fast melodies, which really doesn't reflect the wide range of musical styles present in Egypt. His usual ability to create sweeping, uplifting melodic lines is totally absent. The style is also ""eastern"" more than ""Egyptian"". That may be an unimportant point to some, but I was looking forward to a particular flavor and found it wanting. It's very relaxing and pretty, but other than that..This would be a great CD to relax to or mediate with, but I would not say this is one of Arkenstone's best - perhaps listen to the whole disk first and see if you like it."
4,Buy It and then Buy It Again,"As an absolute lover of music, I have come to miss that era of the vinyl album cover, when we rushed to the record store and purchased someone's long awaited first or follow up album. We then rushed home and played it on the old component set while reading the liner notes on the back of the album. This book reminded me of that time and many pages were a nice walk down memory lane for this music lover. I guess if I had a complaint, perhaps the authors could have divided the book up into genres as opposed to time period. It would have been nice to see various R&B;, Country, Blues, Rock, Disco albums.I will say this, when I saw it in the store- I bought all five copies and then used them for eventual gifts to people. Everytime, I have given one away, it was a hit because everyone is some form of a music lover and everyone can appreciate the vinyl era. Buy this and then buy it again.... for someone else."
4,"Great Reference and ""Memory Stimulator""","As the son of an Old School Disc Jockey my family received Albums in the mail every month from all the major labels. Between that and digging thru record bins at shops as a kid I think I've seen 60 to 75% of the art in this book. I really miss the size of those albums.It makes me think of my first trip to Europe. Seeing the scale the masters used when creating art that we only saw in text books. It can be overwhelming. Maybe thats why most CD art ""under-whelms me to this day. 4 and 3/4 square does not an impression make.I would hope that they would create a volume two. As opposed to purchasing a competing book with some of the same artwork. Its no accident that I design covers for a living now. And yes, I design on a 12 inch spec and shrink down. The art demands it."
3,helpful for the collector....,I wish it were more descriptive but the images of the covers make the purchase worthwile for the collector. It have does have some great images of hard to find covers from the 40's 50's and 60's.
5,Simple solution!,"I was suspicious that my kid was having a reaction to the mildest wipes I could find and was starting to realize how expensive wipes can be, so I asked my mom what kind of wipes she used on us. ""Washclothes with warm water."" So simple ... duh. Now, I can't believe I used the disposable wipes for so long. I'll still use them (tendercare flushables) on the road in a pinch, put the simple water+cloth is working like a charm for us. These ones are soft, yet thin, which seems to work best."
5,best cloth wipes on the market,"I love these wipes. I bought about 70 of them when by daughter was born to use with her Fuzzi Bunz diapers and they've all held up wonderfully. I line dry them and they are bleached white by now. I can't say enough about them! Now, you must use them wet, but that's true of all cloth wipes... I pre-wet them and put them in a little wipes wallet thing right before going out and then make sure to use them within the day (or they'll get mildewy - yuck!). My daughter's never had a real rash and I think it's because these wipes are really good at getting every last trace of poo. I highly recommend them!"
2,Too Stiff,"I like to use these in my wipe warmer, They are thin and easy to clean. My grip is that they are very stiff, even when soaked. No matter how gentle I am when wiping a face or bottom, I feel like this cloth is too rough. I prefer an organic cotton to this flannel wipe."
2,Not for me,"I bought these thinking that I could cut out my wipes also, but so far, I haven't used them. They don't work well dry at all, so I would have to have some form of a system to keep them wet, and with a toddler running around, that isn't too practical for us. Great quality though!"
3,Sloppy Workmanship,"The ornament was Ok, nothing special. The paint job on the car was sloppy. This was bought as a gift so I was kind of disappointed. Don't think I would buy another."
2,Look closely at the picture,When I purchased this item I didn't realize it was hand painted and not professionally done. The paint is messy and doesn't look like the painter cared what color was supposed to go on what part of the car. If you zoom in on the picture I guess you can see that the paint is not precise so it's kind of my fault for not looking closely. It just wasn't what I was expecting.
5,Very nice car,"My Grandson loves the ornament, he will add it to his collection, it is very nice. Thanks, Maxine."
1,Tiny little bottle.,It's a very tiny little bottle. Do not be fooled by this. Huge disappointment. Go to your local dollar store and buy this!
3,Tiny bottel,"This was not the bottel I was expecting ,however it is 4 oz. very tiny bottel. But for 5 bucks what did I expect."
1,"bad costume, like the new movie","Not that you expect a costume like this to be super high quality, but you do expect fundamentals to be accurate. Superman's shirt is blue, and his cape is red. RED. Not grape or magenta or whatever color this is- it is not red. So what I'm saying is- if you're looking for a costume for humor's sake, like if you want to make fun of people who like Superman, than this is a good costume. If you want to make your own Bizzarro symbol and iron it over the Superman symbol, then this might be perfect. But as a ""Superman Costume"" you could not develop a more disappointing product. I assumed my screen's colors were off or the picture was bad. My fault. Still, this is not a Superman costume."
5,Superman Costume,"I was looking for a cheap Superman Costume for an adult as a gag gift. This costume was on clearance for barely more than $6! It's a full costume and is a very nice one....far more than I thought I'd get for the price. Even with shipping added in, it was an amazing value for the money."
2,Odd colors,"I was hoping the picture colors were off, but the red is almost brown on the real item. We won't be using this costume."
4,Good Workout in Little Time,This is a really good 27 minute workout and if you feel up to it and have the time you can do it all again. Every other day should be a cardio-workout. It all gets you in shape fast.
2,Not what I expected,"I am a huge fan of Leslie and her walking I have pretty much all of her workouts.This firming is my least favorite. She lacks a lot in this workout. I wanted more firming moves this is VERY BASIC. This came with 2,3 and 4 fast miles I just expected it to be for advanced walkers."
2,Leslie Sansone's Walk Slim - Fast Firming by Leslie Sansone,This DVD would not play in one of my DVD players. It does work in another DVD player I have. It is almost all stretching. I prefer walking.
3,"Not one of her best, but still decent.","This video is listed as 40 minutes, but it is 27 minutes long, including warm up and stretch. It is probably the least favorite one I've done of hers, because it feels very rushed out and the camera operation is not that great...you see the cue cards during it several times and she spends a lot of time explaining between moves what you are going to do. She was solo too, so you didn't get the playfulness of the group atmosphere.I'm a huge fan of hers, just not so much of this specific video. But I did like the moves she did with the stretchie."
5,Walk fit DVD,"Leslie Sansone makes it easy and comfortable for the average middle aged adult to exercise in the home, to get a good workout without dislocating a joint or throwing our backs out with all the newest exercise DVD's out showing people jumping around, twisting and boxing at the air."
3,Not a fan of this one,I like others that she's done but I did not realize this involved a band which is not my thing.
4,Good short work out,"I have most of Leslie's walk tapes and really enjoy using them. This one with the firm band is OK, but she could have given it more time; making the workout a little more intense with more repetition of the various exercises - overall an OK work out !"
2,Mediocre-->not worth buying,"This cd has alot of ppl on it, but it doesnt seem to have that same 3 6 vibe. There are about 2 good songs on here, and all the rest are just whatever. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Great Album,"This album is awsome,definatly a blast from the past with all the classic artists from Three 6 mafia...very fresh,good quality with yet the underground feel."
1,i'd rate this even less if i could,"reading the other reviews mislead me to believe this album was going to be everything a fan of 3-6 since '97 would want. nope. it is total crap. the even screw up in the intro track. ""toot in the bathroom"" almost was good, but no famaliar voices on it and only the hook is good. look, 3-6 fans, this ain't the good ole days anymore... so the only way you'll get a good album from them is thru the back catalog. hate to say it but i threw away hard earned cash for this piece of S#!+....... don't you do the same. down load it. don't pay the ret@rd who funded this."
3,"Ok, but not the best source","Walbank's small book on the Hellenistic period is certainly well priced -- your students won't complain about that. However they might complain that the book hardly reads or is laid out like an introductory textbook, which it clearly is meant to be. Thus why it is interesting reading for the higher level historian, it is not the best for undergraduates or laypeople."
3,"Good game, good amount of flaws","First of all, this is a pretty good game. It's definaly not a simulation football game though. It also has, in my oinion. a few too many flaws. Flaw #1- you can't create your own team. Flaw #2- you can't max out your created charactor's stats. Flaw #3- get's old after you beat ""own the city"". Those are the big flaws i see in the game. To sumerize, it's not worth $50. Buy it used or rent it."
5,NFL Street 2 Rocks!,"This is a very fun game. Not really meant to be taken seriously.w/ a little bit of NFL Blitz and a little bit of Madden thrown together, fans of the first NFL Street will love this title. My 8 year old son and I play this game alot and he really enjoys it. He likes it a bit more than Madden right now because it holds his interest a little more. There's a lot of trash talk and he gets off on that. All in all it's a good, fun game that kids and the big guys can enjoy. Probably a great game to play when a bunch of buddies are sitting around drinking and having a football night. Enjoy this title guys..."
3,Great Game but same as last years,"NFL Street 2 is a very well made game but it is the same as last years in some ways.The New modes includeStreet Events- kill the carrier, jump ball, 2 on 2, 2 minuete drill and a couple of others.Own the City- U create a player and try to recruit guys for ur team.Online Mode- There was online mode last year but this year the online mode is twice as good.The graphics are amazing and the player faces look so real it is almost scary.If you didnt get NFL Street 1, I suggest this game. It is a decent upgrade but just not enough for ur 50 Dollars.I regret buying this game because I had NFL Street 1."
2,Boring and pompously written,"I couldn't get past the first 20 pages. I flipped through the rest and the same pompous writing style persisted. The author writes in eloquent words and sentences that make me want to fall asleep. His flowerly language and verbosity is a sign of a poor writer who wants to seem talented. Total waste of time and money. Amazon, could I have a refund?"
4,reality of human life,"I found this book to be awe inspiring. If all doctors realized the complexities of the human body and the LIFE contained therein and recognized the sanctity of human existence there probably would be fewer mistakes in surgery. It must be an awesome experience to be inside a human life...not just operating on a body.I literally fell into Dr Selzer's writing style. I bought this book ...blind, so to speak. I didn't know what to expect. I'm glad I was compelled to take a chance on it. I wish he were MY doctor."
4,"Great for a while, then dies","I was really impressed with the first half of this book, which puts the field of surgery and medicine in general into a poetic realm. As a medical student, this approach intrigued me and left me quoting the finer portions of the book to my friends and colleagues. However, in the second half Selzer begins talking of general topics which do not live up to the former portion. I will admit that his commentary on abortion and being bald were interesting, and his admittance of being a perpetually carsick child opened a window to his life that awoke imagery of my own childhood, but these points do not save the worth of the final 100 pages. All in all I would definitely suggest reading this novel if you are in the medical field or are trying to get in, but you'll probably find yourself hurrying towards the end and skipping paragraphs as I did."
3,OK,"I appreciate the promt deliver, but the quality of the Stewie I recieved looked like it fell multiple times or chewed by a puppy. There were scratches in the paint and did not have that NEW glossy finish also, it looked like some pieces were glued back."
3,3 Stars For 3 Minutes,"I have two dogs, one medium-small, another medium-large. I used to buy the Old West Tendon Strip Chews and have been looking for something to replace them since they seem to have been discontinued. These Old West Pizzles are a disappointment in that they lasted no longer than three minutes with either of my dogs and the medium-small one is not a heavy chewer. I suppose I expected these to be more of a ""chew"", but instead they were quite lightweight and brittle, almost like hard taffy sticks, and were gone in no time. These are still good treats for my dogs - they sure aren't complaining - but the search continues for an affordable treat that'll last longer than ten minutes."
1,Lousy phone,"This is the worst phone we have ever owned. The phone is barely one-year old and has never functioned well. It routinely does not capture numbers that are pressed requiring us to dial and redial and redial... you get the point. Now, the screen is malfunctioning so we are unable to see the number we are attempting to dial and our caller id is service is now useless. Avoid this phone at all costs!!Is anyone out there happy with a dual Skype/standard phone? We need a new one!"
5,Great phone,Great phone but I can't find a replacement battery pack. Anyone else have the same problem and can help?
2,LCD screen gone,"I have had this phone for over a year. I had echoing at times but my main problem is the display. It slowly faded away, losing one or more numbers or letters at a time until it is completely blank at this time. Pretty hard to use the functions if there is no display. I will not buy this phone again."
2,Wonderful... Except the LCD Readout,"Purchased this product when it first came out. The LCD panel began to fail shortly after purchase. Yet I like the phone so much I purchased several more after reports that the DUALPhone LCD panel had been replaced. Unfortunately, this is still a key failure point. I will replace this phone and toss it in the garbage."
1,Boring and outdated,This book was a drag. The context was boring and outdated. I didn't appreciate the information it contained and would not have purchased it if I had known that all it would keep referring back to was infidelity. I was hoping for a little less bias.
5,"How Can I Forgive You? : The Courage to Forgive, the Freedom Not To",This book is very well written and has been a wonderful help to me. I find myself rereading sections when I find myself in a particular situation. This book would be good for anyone going through trust issues.
1,Horrible quality,"I purchased the Ware Playpen and the Cavas Cover at the same time. Although I am thrilled with the quality and sturdiness of the pen itself, this cover is completely useless. It is very thin and tears easily. Within eight hours of letting my rabbit run around on it, he had dug two very large holes (about 6"" across) in the fabric, and there were several small rips and deep scratches just from him running around.Mind you, my rabbit is not very large, nor is he particularly rambunctious. I made my own lining out of some plastic-covered material from Beverly's (the kind you make outdoor furniture with) and it has held up well for several weeks now. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product."
2,Canvas Clean Living Pet Floor,"Bought both the Cage and 2 covers. The first time I put on the blue cover, it ripped. A couple of days later the green cover ripped. By that time my ""return window"" has expired. I didn't know I even had a ""return window"". Sooooo now if I return the covers I'll only be credited partially AND I have to pay the shipping.Do NOT buy these covers! If you still do, make sure you try them right away. Don't get stuck like I did. I don't know that'll I'll ever order through Amazon again."
2,Not Satisfied,"This was the worst of all orders I have placed on Amazon. The order came in very late, which I understood was a little delayed due to a public holiday. When the order arrived, I couldn't believe what I saw. The book was creased on the edges and the cover was worn from mishandling. And the book was posted as new!!! Most used books would have come in a better shape. The only criterion that qualified it as new was that there were no markings on the pages. If not that I desperately needed it for class work, I would have returned the book and asked for my money back. In all, I have made a mental note not to buy from the seller anymore. Just note that all that is posted as new, comes in different variations of that type."
5,Essential Purchase for all PCs,"I first read this book when I was doing my Masters. It's the follow-up to Schein's book on organizational consultancy and is, imho, compulsory reading for anyone studying or working in this area. Here he develops his ideas on process consultation.There are already plenty of good, in-depth reviews here to which there's not much I can add, other than to say don't be put off by Schein's academic background. This is a very accessible and thought provoking text with plenty of practical examples to employ within work structures. Even after working as PC for over five years I still refer to it regularly.If you're a management consultant and don't already own a copy - I'd say this is an essential purchase."
1,Inaccurate and NOT Reliable,"I was really hoping that the Brunton Trail Buster Rotating Azimuth Compass would be an accurate compass that I could put in my EDC bag. Unfortunately, it is not accurate or reliable. It consistently failed to point in the proper direction which renders it completely useless. I repeatedly tested its accuracy against other compasses and it continually failed to point in the correct direction.When it comes to utilization of a compass reliability is a significant factor and this compass is not reliable.I do not recommend this compass."
1,A Total Waste of Time & Money,"I thought this book wd help me with my writing, but it's all about Resnick's stories. Completely useless."
5,Absolutely the best ever!,"I've owned this CD for many years, replacing a well-worn LP from over 30 years ago. It is - bar none - the best collection of your favorite carols done in such a powerful, respectful manner that you will truly enjoy every minute listening. Two years ago I had the honor of attending the Philadelphia Orchestra's Christmas concert during which the music was a total reprise of this CD. If you think the CD is great, the only true way to go beyond is to attend the actual performance in a great hall. It is one of my more precious memories."
5,If you only own one Christmas music recording ...,"... this is THE ONE! Like several of the other reviewers of this magnificent recording, I originally bought it as an LP and literally wore it out. It has been used to greet Christmas morning in my home ever since. The first cut, ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing,"" NEVER FAILS to make me a bit leaky around the eyes, especially when the chorale comes in. Many of the same cuts are on the very similar ""Joy to the World"" CD by the same artists, but in a different order. Greeting the newborn Savior on Christmas morn with the trumpet fanfare in ""Hark"" is part of what has come to define my Christmas."
5,A Glorious Sound Indeed,"I remember reading that THE GLORIOUS SOUND OF CHRISTMAS with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra was one of the best selling, if not the best selling classical album of all time. If this is true, it is easy to understand why. The arrangements on this album of classic Christmas carols are handled with pomp and dignity by this world class orchestra. The Temple University Choir joins the orchestra for some pieces. The album has beautiful renditions of many great carols. Some of the best include the arrangement of Ave Maria, O Sanctissima, and O Holy Night. The familiar sounds of this album have been favorites of many people for years now, and will certainly be loved in the years to come."
5,Excellent Christmas Album,"This is a sensational recording made in the early 1960s. My question has been about its sequel, ""A Christmas Tree"": Where is it? Sony/Columbia need to remaster it and release it. Arthur Harris did the incredible and masterful arrangements and Ormandy executed with great performances of the carols."
1,Not what I expected,"Being fond of old-fashioned English christmas carols/hymns, this CD didn't deliver. I bought it mainly hoping it had a well-performed old-style version of ""Oh holy night"" (seems to be tough to find this one!), but alas. If you're more into christmas songs with 'punch', a bit 'bombastic', then this CD is maybe for you."
1,Send it back for remastering,This CD has a great selection of songs from a top-notch choir. Unfortunately the instruments are so loud that you can't hear the singing.
4,America,"Some great patiotic songs on this cd. The choir as always sounds great. gave only a 4 star review because iam feeling a little less patriotic since the last, say, 8 elections. We need a Lincoln, Garfield, Mckinley, or JFK badly."
3,"It's ""OK""","It's not the worst CD I've ever purchased, but, it's a far cry from the best too. This thing is reeeeaaaalllly patriotic. Truth be told, I ordered it for two or three songs in particular, and the rest just happen to be on it. If you know the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and if you know these songs, then you're already aware of what you're walking in to before you order it."
4,Nice recording - but consider some others,"""God Bless America"" is a nice recording. Everything is well performed. But like the Shaw recording of many of these same pieces, I think that patriotic music should be a bit crisper (i.e. it should have the flavor of a Sousa Band rather than a Symphony Orchestra). I also think that a men's chorus is perhaps a more effective instrument for most of these works (e.g. all of the service Hymns and anthems). Two fine recordings to consider are the patriotic recording by the all-male U.S. Army Chorus on the Allegro label and better still, the new patriotic CD - ""The Spirit of Freedom"" - by the Washington Men's Camerata on Gothic."
4,Bosch Large pusher/sleeve assembly,"Great product. Wish they made the plastic as strong as they use to, because if you use too much force you can break the back off, but this has held up fairly well. The white piece to loke the pusher in place also broke, but it's still working fine. Wish they made things like they used to (and I'm only 35!)!"
2,Poor quality,"Like many posters, I'm disappointed by the quality of this piece. The one that came with the unit lasted 10 years, the 2 replacements each last about a year on two. I'm not doing anything differently, so it looks like they've let the quality slip."
1,Does not fit,"This is being sold as a part for DLC-8F but it does not fit, the correct part no is DLC-018b. The top will not lock in place with this part. It fits the bowl top okay but will not lock in place and hence the food processor will not turn on. In the picture of the item as shown on Amazon the piece at the back is completely wrong"
1,POOR QUALITY PRODUCT,"Replaced bowl and cover parts for older processor. DLC-018BGTX part is shoddy, small parts have broke easily, cracks developed and Cuisinart warranties it for 30 days only. Very disappointing."
4,"good, but will it last?","My old Cuisinart finally wore out, so I bought this new one, the same size as the old. Alas, the sleeve and now the mixing bowl just are not lasting like the old ones did. I am disappointed. Are they not dishwasher safe any more?"
5,large pusher/sleeve assembly replacement due to broken locking mechanism,Thankful to be able to use my food processor again. I wish the locking mechanism was more durable. this is my second cuisinart processor that I have had to replace the pusher/sleeve assembly. I replaced the first processor after 20+ years ofmuch use.
3,Utility part,"This is a part to replace a part which broke on a Cuisinart food processor. The replacement was identical to the original, which was not designed to stand up under years of service."
3,Last one broke,"The pusher works well as expected, but the safety tab which allows the motor to engage is quite fragile and appears brittle. I would think that a more impact resistant/less brilttle plastic would be used. So be careful when using it."
1,CHeap,"I bought this three months ago for my 20 year old food processor and it just snapped with for no reason as it was clicking in, wish I knew of another source to get one,"
3,necessary part for Cuisinart,product failed after 5+years. purchased a replacement because ubit will not work without this part. price was good for replacement. I'll be extra careful using it-it's fragile.
2,Large??? Pusher Sleeve Assembly,"When I ordered this ""large"" pusher sleeve assmebly, I thought it would allow me to process larger pieces of fruits or vegetables. This is pusher sleeve is the same size as the one that came w/ my food processor which requires me to cut vegetables and fruit into pretty small pieces to fit through the opening. Also, I have an older food processor - purchased in the mid-1990s. This pusher sleeve does not fit my food processor even though the description indicated that it would. If you are trying to replace a broken pusher sleeve on a newer model food processor then this product might work for you. Unfortunately, it didn't for me. The good thing is that Amazon made it extremely easy to return!!"
5,Cuisinart Pusher,I love the Cuisinart food processor and when parts break after MUCH MUCH use I order a quality product. Thanks
4,Even better than my original....,"had to determine which parts fit my cuisinart at a different site ~ ~ but the part i received is perfect ~ with one exception would have appreciated the description saying ""small pusher sold separately."" also ~ since i was ordering four parts,a discount would have been appropriate."
4,Much better than I expected!,"When I first bought this book, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. This book gave much political, social and religious context to the times of Pride & Prejudice. While the author's writing style is clearly different from Jane Austen's, I never felt that it was lacking in character depth or plot development. I highly recommend this book for readers who wonder how the lives of Pride & Prejudice's characters play out beyond the marriage of Elizabeth Bennet & Fitzwilliam Darcy."
4,Great Read for P&P fans,"I really enjoyed reading this book, I could barely put it down after the first 100 pages. By focusing on Georgiana, the author didn't have to create friction in the lives of our favorite fairy tale couples, and could create her own believable version. I liked her writing style overall, which reflected the regency period, but more contemporary. Also, the author also heald her characters up to a high standard, like Austen. I have passed this book around to other P&P fans, and they have enjoyed it as well. Highly recommend to anyone who knows the P&P background."
5,Pride and Prejudice with Georgiana and Jacob,"This is one of my favorite P & P sequels. The author takes characteristics of Elizabeth and Darcy and gives them to Georgiana and Jacob. If you do not fall in love with this vicar as much as you did with Mr. Darcy, there is something wrong. I love the scene when he explains to the captain why Georgiana will make the captain a good wife, and then they all realize he is telling why Georgiana will make him a good wife. If you love P & P, then this book will be satisfying."
2,Miss Austen is spinning in her grave,"The kindest comment I can make upon Burris' writing is that I have read worse Austen pastiches. He has a slim grasp of the conentions of spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, and would benefit greatly from the services of a copy editor. His story also makes evident the sad fact that his knowledge of Austen is drawn from television, rather than direct perusal of her novels. Disappointing."
5,A Refreshingly Good Sequel,"As a devoted Jane Austen fan, I have read dozens of sequels to her novels, and unfortunately, most fall far short. Not so with Conviction, the story of Georgiana Darcy's growth and love for vicar Jacob Markwood. Because he is a vicar, there is quite a bit of Christian theology in the book. While this may not be to everyone's tastes, as a hero, Markwood's idealism can melt hearts as much as Mr. Darcy himself.Inasmuch as Conviction is a sequel to Pride and Prejudice, I also view it as a parallel or mirror image to Jane Austen's Persuasion. Just as Anne Elliot relinquishes Wentworth at the persuasion of another, Georgiana struggles with herself as she chooses the man amongst her many admirers whom she loves with conviction."
2,None,"I was sadly disappointed in this book. I would expect writing of this caliber from a bad romance novelist, not a sequel to Austens work. it did not even attempt the capture the spirit of Pride and Prejudice."
2,Cunvickshun,"If you can stand multiple, jaw-dropping misspellings in a published work, it is possible to enjoy this book. The story is as entertaining as most such sequels, but I couldn't seem to get around its being so poorly written."
4,Beautiful...,"I have to agree with others here...This is a true anime gem.The relationship that is built in this story is truly remarkable.The end is powerful and satisfying!I find it hard to believe anyone could watch this and not be compelled to tell others about it...I will warn though:I didn't give it 5 stars because of the action. It is fairly canned and is purely to drive the story forward... (This isn't a bad thing) however the monsters remind me of watching old Godzilla movies (Not bad, just not the highest production quality by todays standards.)The relationship with the two ""sisters"" will capture you and completely rip your heart out too... needless to say you will enjoy this. But I think too, you will be moved by it."
2,What a HIDEOUS cover art!,A plastic-looking tanorexic squeezed between two life-sized Ken dolls.This probably says it all about the story itself.:P
2,Good but flawed; spend a little extra and get a better text.,"This is basically a good text, but it covers little that is not contained in Dreamweaver 3's tutorial. However, the book has two significant flaws beyond that which turn my recommendation to a 'don't buy.'First, the text makes frequent reference to an 'online companion' web site. This site is said to contain a great deal of the real 'meat' of using Dreamweaver. As of this review (some four months after publication), the site is still 'under construction.' As such, there is significant information simply not available.Second, the final chapter on how to use the FTP Client built into Dreamweaver is horrible! Little information is given about this critical step.I suggest, in light of the fact that most of the information in this book is readily available in Dreamweavers help files and tutorial, that you give it a 'pass' and spend a little extra for a better text. A good starting place would be the 'bible' series."
3,"For the Intermediate-to-Advanced, Yet Another Manual","I bought this book prior to using the software, thanks to rumors of Dreamweaver's supposed higher learning curve.In hindsight, the official manual shipped with Dreamweaver has more in common with this book than just their size and length, for the manual covers essentially the same topics dealt with in this somewhat prosaic, clone-like book. The inclusion of more screenshots and the occasional humor fail to enrich the contents sufficiently for the casual intermediate-to-advanced user.For that crowd, a guide of insight to taking advantage of Dreamweaver's more subtle functions, at the same time addressing its few quirks, is more useful than a run-of-the-mill explanation of such basics as what tables and frames are.Indeed, the novice should consider the Lynda Weinman book: pricier but by far friendlier and livier. Certainly you won't get Yet Another Manual!"
3,Bring a Magnifying Glass,"I had some experience with HTML and FrontPage, so I found the first half of the book perfect for my needs, except that the visuals were a bit small. I actually thought the early chapters were carefully written. The book crashed in the Style Sheets chapter, which did not explain style sheets so that I could grasp them, and offered absurdly small visuals with code that the reader was invited to examine. The book recovered with layers and behavior modification somewhat, then offered a cursory coverage of timelines, which requires a more look-see-do approach for beginners. Also, some surprisingly careless editing, which a $20 tag for a 500 page book explains but does not excuse. This book could have been much better with more careful writing in the second half, larger visuals, and more careful proofing."
2,"Great, if you already know dreamweaver.","This book makes a good companion book to the book already provided along with the Dreamweaver 3 sofware, but does not walk you through actual web page development. I am now odering Dreamweaver for Dummies, so I can get some sort of a handle on Dreamweaver 3."
1,Bleh,"This book does not cover more than the tutorial - and if you already have the same book for Dreamweaver 2 (Peach Pit Press - just like this one) and are a beginner or just getting started... you can certainly get by between the a Dreamweaver 2 book and the online tutorial. This book is just not worth the money. If you are a beginner across the board - the visual quickstarts are easy to follow, but still you can get just as much info in the online tutorials. If you want a real help - I recommend the 'Bible' series."
2,its a big no no for those just starting out,"I have to admit i do buy a lot of the visual quickstart books,but i do only buy them 1)hopeing that one day i may be able to understand them 2)it looks great with the collection on my book shelf.I bought the book when i didnt know anything about dreamweaver and couldnt get into it at all, i read a few pages and put it back on the book self with the rest of the V.Q.G books.It was very hard to understand it would be impossible for anyone new to web designing to read and even thoses who are use other web design software will find it a struggle to keep up with.But for those who knows the ins and outs of dreamweaver and needs a book for reference then it may be worth it."
2,Save your money,"This covers the pgrogram on a feature by feature basis, but doesn't do as good a job explaining how to use the program as the dreamweaver tutorial."
2,"Standard Peachpit ease of use, but you don't need this book","You can learn this much Dreamweaver from the manual and playing aroud with it for a while. If you need a simple reference manual, go ahead and get this. But if you want to learn Dreamweaver as a regular user, invest in a better book."
3,Does a satisfactory-but not outstanding-job,"This book does what you expect--teaches Dreamweaver without a having to slog through thick, dense manual, but is lacking in some areas. The instructions aren't always clear, and there are typos/mistakes. It helps a lot if you already know HTML and other desktop publishing/layout programs already. If I had to pick again, I'd probably look for something else first, but buy this one if I couldn't find another guide which is supposed to teach you fast."
2,Quickstart My Heart!!,"This is a decent referance book but by no means should be used as a training guide. In reality this book is no more than an extended manual. They claim that the easiest way to learn is by looking at their photos but the truth is that there is no better training than actually getting on the computer and doing. For beginners I would say skip this book and head directly to Hands On Training with Dreamweaver 3, possibly one of the best learning tools for Dreamweaver 3 around."
2,Step by Step Samples Missing,"This reference, although long on explanations, does not provide walk through exercises to employ the techniques & tools in Dreamweaver. It is not for the novice..... I was disappointed as my other Quickstart Guides have been excellent."
5,Maximum-strength Morricone,"As there have been a number of different CD editions of Ennio Morricone's soundtrack to Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" let's get the basics straight: the title as it appears on the digipack is: IL ETAIT UNE FOIS DANS L'OUEST; the cover bears a photo of a man hung from a stone arch against a blue sky; the label is BMG France/RCA Victor Gold Series (the disc is not gold). The remastered sound is smooth and detailed, making the American CD seem harsh and sterile by comparison. This 1968 score includes brief but extremely powerful use of distorted electric guitar, providing a dramatic contrast to the romantic orchestral passages and weirdly homespun banjo interludes. Notes on the previously unreleased tracks are in French, while the original 1972 LP sleeve notes appear in English. While the booklet and packaging are not particularly elaborate, the improved sound and track sequence make this reissue an essential upgrade."
5,Simply Delightful!,"As a mother of two in Seattle, and owner of this book, I think that it is a sweet depiction of child-rearing in the city. I was actually just going online to purchase another copy for a friend's shower next week. I am surprised that some of these reviewers see this small book with only twenty words as an entire indictment of the upper middle class. I don't know how taking your child to a coffee shop or a museum makes you ""obnoxious"" and/or ""pretentious"". I would say it that it is a fair statement to say that parents everywhere want the best for their children - for them to be well cared-for and well-educated - what should be considered loathsome about that?"
5,city girls,"My two little girls love this book and the new one, Country Babies Wear Plaid. The illustrations are so sweet. Both books are such nice examples of highlighting the differences between raising kids around the country."
1,Simply Horrible,This book is utter trash! My child got the most benefit out of this book by teething on it. Nothing in this book is actually made for children. This is a waste of money. I'm so disgusted I think I'm just going to avoid all of this author's books without even giving them a chance.
5,Fun for Parent and Child,"It's so great to finally have a book that talks about City life with your baby. I got this as a shower gift for my first baby, and I couldn't be happier with it. There are so many stories for visiting the zoo or park, but not much for everyday life in the city. It's nice to have something that my child will identify with such as baby yoga or going out for coffee. The illustrations are so vibrant and fun for kids of all ages as well as engaging for the parents. The clever text is perfect for beginning readers and listeners. I can't wait until my baby is born so I share my excitment for this book with my child. I highly recommend this book (even if you don't live in the city!)"
5,Fun for parents to read,"This is definitely one of those books that you as a parent have more fun reading than your child actually understands. Each page starts off with ""Urban Babies like to..."" then fills in things like ""go to the museum"" or ""take a taxi"" - things that families who live in cities tend to do with their child. I think the illustrations are fun, not obnoxious, and go to the heart of what ""city living"" means to parents of small children. It is a board book, probably best for 12-24 mos children, but I am currently reading it to my 9 mos old and I really enjoy reading it (and she doesn't mind chewing on it afterwards...)"
1,loathful,"What a pile of ignorant pretense.We live in a very urban area and while my baby does, in fact, wear black and go to museums, he has never had a bottle or a pacifier, as is depicted on many pages in this book.There's more to being urban than ""the scene""...I agree...totally obnoxious."
4,"Enjoyable read, memorable characters.","This book made for an enjoyable read, despite a character that was unusual at best. The American publisher changed the title and cover photo to something our public would ""get"", as we don't understand irony! ""The Great Husband Hunt"" has almost nothing to do with the story and the photo is insipid cheesecake. Had I seen the cover first, I'd never have bought the book and was pleasantly surprised at the content. The Unfortunates (British title) is surprising, witty, and an interesting look at the life of the ""fortunate"" class of the 20th century."
3,"Entertaining, but ultimately unsatisfying","It may be a personal quirk but I have a hard time really enjoying books where I don't like the main character. I agree with the other reviewers that the title and marketing of this book are misleading; they suggest a fluffier romance. Instead, the novel sprawls throughout Poppy's long life, from the Titanic through the world wars, and you never really understand why, at her core, Poppy can't seem to attach to anyone. But the wondering keeps you reading until the end, even if you're not satisfied."
4,OTC 7311a Pitman arm puller,Good quality product. Should come with hardened nuts and and bolts instead of what was supplied. But easily replaced with grade 8 hardware. Works like a champ.
4,Don't hate me because I'm a clerk!,"I enjoy urban fantasy & magical realism, and really do admire de Lint's work. Sometimes, however, I wish that he and other authors in the genre would create more down-to-earth characters with real-life jobs. After all, someone has to manage stores, clean teeth and mop floors, even in Newford. Some of the stereotyping of certain occupations (such as financial fields) make the characters seem like cutouts. And most parents aren't as terrible as they're often portrayed in his stories.I've gotten away from this genre in general but will come back when I can recognize real people in the characters."
4,An Emotionally Moving Urban Fantasy,"I really didn't think I'd like this book. I usually try to avoid fantasy books without any science. I avoid them because they are either simplistic rehashes or cliche. There seems to be too much of this fantasy stuff around and much of it mediocre, and I avoided Charles De Lint as seemingly in this category. Finally though the cover and title of this book grabbed me and I tried it. I was really surprised at how this book kept my interest and really made me feel for the characters. Memory and Dream is a beautiful book that made me recall the love, memories, sadness, pain, redemption, forgiveness, and letting go that we all have to do with our dreams, pasts, and artistic creations. The book made me cry and laugh and feel..and that's what a dream should do..."
5,A tale well told...,"...with characters that de Lint makes you care about (or hate, as the case may be) and a plot that jumps back and forth in time, continually unfolding. Good stuff here."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Artist and art abuse, perhaps.The fantasy part of this books comes through a painter, who is your usual broke artist type, and she definitely has not had that happy an existence in the past.So, the question is that of new art mentor looking to guide her in the art of magical painting as such - is this person actually going to help, or be yet another abuser to come along?A bit on the dull side, this one.2.5 out of 5"
1,Horrible disappointment!,Imagine our disappointment when my daughter opened this toy for her 4th birthday and it didn't work at all. I called the 800 number for service and they said I must have gotten a defective model. After reading a couple other reviews it looks like 80% of these cd players are defective. Save yourself the return trip and don't buy this toy.
1,Totally not worth it.,Received them quickly. I was so very excited to try them after everyone's rave reviews. I was disappointed. I guess getting them on sale was my biggest mistake. The set came with the 05 totally dry and the 03 ran out after one use. I even thought it might be clogged but I was using them on dry bristle paper so there is nothing to clog the point. I continued to use the others and 3 month into using them they are all totally all dry. So I am very disappointed. I will not buy these again. I will spend the extra money and get the refillable pens.
1,Good till they leak ! buy faber castell PITT artist pens instead,Ive used dozens of these pens over the years maybe even hundreds they work good when you first get them but they always leak around the tip under the cap I dont know what the deal is but its a problem I always have with the MICRONS I really like these pens for art but they are expensive for a pen thats gunna leak and you will just have to throw in the trash for this reason I dont even use this brand anymore I recommend the Faber-Castell PITT artist pens instead they are very nice and dont leak
5,Excellent for marking on fabric,"A long time ago I read in a Quilting magazine that you can write on fabric with these pens and the ink will not bleed. It's true. I bought them for writing Quilt labels. There are 6 different sizes in the pack, from extremely fine to normal. I don't know what the tips are made of but they certainly seem sturdier than regular pen tips, I expect them to last for the duration of the ink with careful use. Apparently the ink is also fade resistant, I cannot speak to that as only time will tell but I have confidence in this product."
2,Decent Pen Nothing Special,I might have given these pens a 3 star rating but one pen came without any ink. A decent pen at a decent price but nothing that would inspire me to purchase them again. For their purpose when they come with ink work as stated.
3,smeared on photos,"i bought these bc i heard they were great for back of photos. I've bought microns before and loved them for outlining and art but they didn't hold up on the back of my photos like i thougt they would. Great marker, 3 starts for use on photobacks"
3,black ink pens,the sakura pigma black ink in the pen seems to be dry - i have to shake the pen really hard until the ink starts to flow
4,Worth it,"The package sucks as a pen holder except if you're traveling and do not want the pens rolling around loose anywhere.The pens are awesome but if you're heavy handed you NEED to be careful, the smallest nibswear down fast."
2,Sakura Pigma Micron Pen Set,"These pens are great if you need to do drawing or sketching with a very fine tip. I liked the quality of most of the pens, except I had one pen no# 2 which was almost dry (and I just got the package yesterday).These pens were not lasting ones. Many of them dried up pretty fast, and after 3 months all are dried. Otherwise, I think these are very good pens."
3,They're Okay....,"I got these pens and I will admit they're great for the 8 bucks I bought them for... BUT they ran out pretty quickly, and they aren't refillable. I much prefer Copics SP multiliner pens, to be honest."
3,Weak pen tips,The pen tips are very fragile even for the thicker ones. Other than that they're fun and easy to use.
2,Contents not as stated,The package description is not accurate. The pen with the finest point is missing and there are two pens with the size of .25mm but the .20mm pen is listed but was not included.
3,Not too bad,"Getting these a 1/3 of the price on Amazon then you can at a store makes it a nice online buy. They're around $25 at Hobby Lobby. Keep in mind that they bleed when you use any kind of marker over them. I used Copic and Utrechtart markers and they smeared. Not bad sketching pens, but Steadtler is really a step up and doesn't smear if you're looking to do some fancy industrial design drawing."
3,The jury is still out,"I haven't given them a real work out, but it's hard to tell the difference between some of the pen weights. Next time I will purchase individual pens and skip some of the intermediate sizes."
5,These are amazing ffor the price,"You can argue which are better, but price to quality these win hands down. We have never had a problem with them and i believe we have ordered over 10 sets."
1,SAKURA PIGMA MICRON PENS,The pens I received did not work well at all. They appeared to dry out quickly. I used for less than two weeks and found the pens to be of no use to me. Decided that the cost to return to receive refund was not worth the effort. Bad experience for me. Do not recommend that you buy this over the internet. Best to go to your local Office store to see if they have sample of pens for you to try before you make a purchase.
4,Great for sketching and detailed drawings,"These pens are great for sketching and detailed work. I bought the color set and Im really impressed by the accuracy and ink quality. Two problems I have with these pens is that their nibs wear out VERY fast and although the handle isn't the best, its bearable."
3,great pens but some dried fast,"These were great pens, I loved to use these pens. However, two of the six dried in 2 months. The rest have lasted several months now. So, the quality is uneven, but I like to draw with these. The ink is really black and the pens' tips are tiny - great for sketching."
5,First-Rate,"These are superb pens for ""tangling"" with the different widths, ease of use, and ""dryability"" (not a word, I suppose).I do wish they lasted a bit longer, though."
3,Anti-War Play done in Pro-war style,"This is significantly Olivier's first play, and it was made unfortunately in Pro-War times. An examination of the script shows that Shakepeare was trying to show Henry to be a hero, but war to be wrong. The script was sorely cut for Olivier, into an all pro-war/England is invincible rendition. this version suffers from the cutting more than the acting, and does not convey accurately what Shakespeare's points."
2,Henry V: Men In Tights,"Terrible costumes, wobbly sets, hilarious makeup, dodgy Irish and Welsh accents. Yes, the guy who wrote the script had a way with words, I grant you. But like Hitler's Buzz Bombs and V-2 rockets, what must have been shiny, new and explosive back in 1944 now looks hopelessly dated."
2,Highly Subjective Interpretation,"This is a highly subjective, heavily edited version of the Shakespeare play. The playtext was cherry-picked to portray Henry as a pure, virtuous, patriotic leader. However, Shakespeare's Henry was very, very different. In addition to his good qualities, Shakespeare's Henry also made political deals with the clergy, executed enemy prisoners (and his own soldiers), threatened innocent people with rape and plunder, and threw his soldiers headlong into battle for highly questionable reasons--all while neglecting urgent issues at home. (Remind you of a certain US president?) Of course, this film was deliberately made as a WWII propaganda piece, so the English king had to be portrayed in a positive light. However, this film is far from representing the Shakespeare play. The color and inventive staging are pleasant to see. Unfortunately, the extreme departure from Shakespeare's text renders this play extremely dated."
2,very disappointed,"I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of flack for this, but am I the only person can't figure out why eveyone loves Laurence Olivier?? I bought the DVD for a paper I'm writing on Henry V, and I was disappointed with so many things. First off, Olivier's acting is all that it's cracked up to be. I know that he was a head of his time, but his acting has not been able to stand up to the test of time. His lines are forced, there's no emotion in his presentation. Parts of scenes that I think are extremely important to the storyline have been omitted to make sure that his ""yay! war!!"" feel of the movie does not get lost. The battle scenes are completely glossed over to show the ""happier"" aspects of war."
5,Classic Movie,I enjoyed this movie on 16mm at home in the '80's. Olivier is brilliant and the supporting cast is excellent.
2,"Great film,but poor color.","I tried three different copies of the Criterion ""Henry V."" In each one the colors kept fading in and out. This is the fault not of Olivier's film (whose Technicolor was superb) but of Criterion's transfer from film to DVD. Very disappointing!"
3,one of the weaker versions,"This is one of the weaker versions of Shakespeare from Olivier. Some of it is almost absurd. However, as usual, he creates some strong scenes."
5,"A reader friendly"" guide to becoming more successful and satisfied with every aspect of your personal and professional life","Say It, See It, Be It: How Visions And Affirmations Will Change Your Life by Arlene Rosenberg is about self empowerment and personal growth through the use of dedicated affirmations and life-enhancing personal visions. Introducing an easy-to-follow and informative explanation of ""inner genius"", self-esteem, success and security, as well as just how to retain an extraordinary personal and professional life, Say It, See It, Be It is a thoroughly ""reader friendly"" guide to becoming more successful and satisfied with every aspect of your personal and professional life. A welcome addition to any personal self-help or self-improvement reading list, Say It, See It, Be It is very highly recommended reading."
5,the original cast; still definitive!,"The original Broadway cast album of MY FAIR LADY is a mandatory disc in every self-respecting musical fan's collection. It captures the cast at the top of their game, and Julie Andrews at the peak of her Broadway career. Her voice is sparkling and effervescent, with Rex Harrison as a thrilling Higgins and Stanley Holloway a delight as Eliza's erstwhile father Alfred P. Doolittle. The monaural sound is warm and lush in Columbia's best style. This newest remaster of the album sounds better than ever. By the time the London cast album was recorded 4 years later (to take advantage of the new stereo format), a tired feeling had crept into Julie Andrews' singing (or perhaps boredom), so the Broadway edition is the format of choice, despite the technical limitations of the mono mix."
5,This deserves 500 stars!,"With Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews in one musical, you can't score any higher! Rex and his sidekick Robert Coote provide more humor than you could ask for with WHY CAN'T THE ENGLISH?, I'M AN ORDINARY MAN, YOU DID IT, and A HYMN TO HIM; but Rex shows sentiment in the great I'VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO HER FACE. Julie Andrews sings her heart out with WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY, THE RAIN IN SPAIN, SHOW ME, WITHOUT YOU, and of course, I COULD HAVE DANCED ALL NIGHT. ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE, sung by John Michael King, is very romantic. Stanley Holloway provides great fun with WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK and GET ME TO THE CHURCH ON TIME. Available on the London cast album is the magnificent EMBASSY WALTZ, a more beautiful arrangement than Richard Rodgers' CAROUSEL WALTZ. The lovely OVERTURE helps contribute to the album. Could someone please let me know when a better Broadway musical score is written?"
3,The London Recording is Better,"I recently purchased the Broadway recording, then turned around and got the London cast recording (both with Rex Harrision, Julie Andrews and Stanley Holloway). Though the recording has wonderful music, the recording was nevertheless just so disappointing, and not the way I remembered it. The latter recording isn't nearly so measured. It's far more vital, witty and sarcastic. I highly recommend it."
5,Great buy....Worth the price,Its smooth...excellent handling on my PS2. Haven't tried on my PC. excellent value for Money...My Pal Arun is now jealous....
5,lovely green shoes,"The moment I saw these shoes on Amazon, it was love at first size ( yes , they had my size, which is not that easy to find ! ).Great shoes, very comfortable despite the high hill, and I got plenty of compliments on them. Highly recommended !"
2,not really worth it,"My fiancée and I decided to get a copy of Bartlett's Words for the Wedding because we were having trouble finding an interesting reading for our ceremony and were getting tired of pouring over our favorite novels and poetry collections. This collection seemed like a good answer. Unfortunately it's really not.The vast majority of the selections included are cheesy and, even worse, hackneyed poems from the like of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Shakespeare... all the usual suspects. Quite literally nothing that couldn't easily be found elsewhere for free. I gave the book two stars only because I thought it might be useful for a wedding planner to loan out to a particularly baffled client as a sort of ""Wedding Standards.""If you're looking for anything new or unique, this isn't the book for you."
5,Beautiful Whale!,"This is a beautiful whale and a nice size. I bought it for my two year old who loves aquatic animals. It is perfect for the tub, it floats and if you drop it into the water it glides gracefully back to the surface. Absolutely love this whale! I highly recommend it to any whale lover."
3,nice carving... some issues...,"well, I was low in the learning curve, I got this trucks by mistake, I did not read it al, but I like the performance. I have some issues like the adjusting bolt gets loose, so I put a extra nut and make a double nut very tight so trucks stay togheter."
5,great book for my 6 year old,"My six-year-old daughter loves this workbook. I think it is because it started out with questions about things OTHER than divorce, like ""list three things that make you happy,"" and ""draw a picture of you doing something you love."" It eased into the more emotionally-charged issues, so by the time we got to them, she was comfortable with the process. I would recommend it, and the companion book for adults."
3,Mediocre resource,"Although this book covers many important topics related to divorce, the activities are mostly ""paper-pencil"" and therefore not very engaging for children.Other books for mental health professionals working with children of divorce include:Creative Interventions for Children of DivorceComplete Group Counseling Program for Children of Divorce: Ready-To-Use Plans & Materials for Small & Large Groups, Grades 1-6"
4,Dealing with people,"This book is now out of print, but it is very helpful for knowing how to deal with people even today."
5,A message for all humans,"I know this book is for kids, but I received it as a grownup's gift and was in tears before I got to the third page. The message this book imparts gives a gentle reminder that we all bring something to the world and our very existence is something to be treasured. It also reminds the reader that we have the potential to bring positive action to our world and the people in it. These are valuable thoughts for readers of any age. It's the core message of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" but in a far more accessible story.The next time I'm having a bad day or I feel discouraged about my life, I will turn to this little book with a very profound message and read it again and again.This a keeper--for life."
2,Good idea but kids got bored of it quick.,"I had very high hopes for this book based on the reviews I read here on Amazon. Normally when we get a new book our daughters (3 yr and 18 mos) want us to read them constantly. This is one book they never ask for. To put it bluntly, the book is boring. The message is great, but there isn't anything to keep their attention. I can't help but wonder if it will be a better book for them when they're older and can be more introspective."
5,great,the book is exactly what i wanted. arrived as described in the review. no complaints everything worked out well and i am happy
3,"I have vista, and half life 2 crashed.","I Love the game but, it crashed on windows vista.Do you have a patch?"
5,The Best FPS on Xbox!,"I have played every FPS that comes out on Xbox. Of course I like Halo, Doom 3, but love playing anything Conflict makes i.e Desert Storm I and II, Vietnam, and Global Terror and the Rainbow 6 series, since I'm in the Army. Half-Life 2 is by far the best game I have played. I thought I wouldn't like it because it had no map option or hints for objectives, but all you have to do is have time and an imagination and you will be spending hours on end playing this game. I bought it for $15.00 at Game Stop, but if I had of spent $49.99 I would not have been disappointed one bit. I have not beat this game but have put over 512 (over 8 hours) minutes into it. This is definitely worth buying used or new, if you have time you will get your $$ worth out of this game!C-Murder"
3,Kinda Boring,The graphics are great the story is pretty good but everything takes forever. This is an impressive game its just that it gets a little boring and easy. I also don't like first person shooters that don't have two players I need to interact with others I guess. Halo is the way to go
5,HL2 Review,This game rocks!! i've heard many people say thatHalf Life 2for xbox isnt as good as the pc version but i absolutely love this game. the graphics are amazing and gameplay is WOW! 5 stars!
3,Bonnie + Clyde - Bonnie = Not very entertaining,"Yet another movie (this one made for TV) about famous 1930's bank robber John Dillinger. This time Dillinger is played by Mark Harmon and Marshal Melvin Purvis, Dillinger's nemesis, is played by Will Patton. Moves too fast to become boring, but its instantly forgettable despite the good cast. Stick with John Milius' 1973 movie of the same name."
2,Not what I expected.,"I have a now, 4 yr old, that I bought this for, who, has everything "" train"", that one can imagine. In fact, I'm pretty sure ""train!"" was his fist clear word. Based on the reviews 4 months ago, I thought this would measure up to other great train videos for kids. While I love, LOVE, word world and, would allow him to watch it all day (not that I do), this had only a very small section with ""roo"" that depicted anything about trains at all. I had hoped for something like the Mickey Mouse Express. It wasn't. In fact, if I gave it away? I'm certain he wouldn't even notice it was missing. For me, that speaks volumes, especially, when ""TV"" isn't part of our daily repertoire."
2,The Forces That Shape the News,"According to Lieberman, a Columbia Journalism Review contributing editor, the ""forces"" in her book's title are a cabal of conservative think tanks like the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation. She maintains that by inundating news organizations with position papers, self-serving statistics, and talking heads, their operatives have insidiously shifted national debate rightward. Through four exhaustively documented case studies, she revisits the political right's plans to delegitimize both the American Association of Retired Persons and Head Start, ""save"" (read: cut) Medicare, and ""modernize"" (read: water down) the powers of the FDA. Scary and compelling, Lieberman's screed gives the lie to the notion of the ""liberal media"" even as it will be read by some as a product of that same mythic beast."
5,Dzogchen Essentials,"""Dzogchen Essentials"" along with its companion version, ""Dzogchen Primer: The Path That Clarifies Confusion,"" are truly essential readings for those interested in progressing along the Buddhist path of spiritual transformation. In essence, these are compendiums of ingeniously selected and elegantly translated works from some of the great Tibetan meditation masters. Readings range from ancient masters such as Padmasambhava up to contemporary masters such as Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and Sogyal Rinpoche. For the first time, these collections offer readers a range of insightful guidance and heart-felt instructions from Tibetan masters of the profound Dzogchen meditation tradition. These books are among the few in English that make available these precious treasures of Tibetan Buddhist spiritual literature -- making them truly essential readings."
5,AMAZING,Amazing Concert! I was not there but now wish I was. You'll be singing these songs in your head for weeks ( that is a good thing )Great African Mix's to there old songs...WOW
4,amazing,"A very entertaining DVD/CD combo. Very unique sound. Heads up though, make sure you buy the DVD version and not just the CD because they are both out there for sale with the same cover."
4,what you can't find on other albums is on this one.,"""i put a spell on you"" may be one of the greatest early rock and roll songs around, but it's also included on every screamin'jay album around. what makes this album amazing is the inclusion of lesser-known but still great songs like ""baptize me in wine"" and jay's take on ""öl'man river,"" which rolls along quietly and smoothly until he explodes into his usual manic howling and screaming. frankly there's some stuff on here that is completely unnecessary, and you almost certainly won't be able to listen to this album all the way through because of its length, but its more comprehensive than other albums and includes biographical notes that come from someone who actually knew screamin' jay, albeit only in a somewhat cursory way. the point is that a lot of best-ofs give you the hits without any sense of continuity, but this album is what it says it is: a portrait of the man, screamin'jay hawkins, and the progression of his career."
3,Edward Hopper Americana,"This print hangs in my office. I like the colors and scene and reminds me of a simpler by-gone time. The print is ok, not the quality I was expecting but acceptable for the price I paid."
1,Might have done the trick if BOTH sides had velcro,"Unfortunately I received this product and while one of the tie straps had been sown with a velcro piece, the other strap looked as if it had been cut with a pair of scissors and no velcro piece was sown onto it. This is not an expensive item and velcro is not a high priced item so I purchased a piece for $2 and sewed it on myself. Now it works perfect, but too much trouble for such an inexpensive item. Anyone could make this with a clip on tie, two pieces of velcro, and a needle and thread."
3,A bit of a surprise,"A nice little book for very young readers, kindergarten and maybe lst grade. But I was thinking is was suitable for a seven year old in 2nd grade, and he has gone considerably beyond the level of Owly Vol 2. It was described as a graphic novel but that would seem (to me) to be an exaggerated idea...it has few words and lots of pictures, and calling it a novel gives a wrong idea. For young children, however, it would be a fine, althought pretty short, bedtime book...but graphic novel I think not."
4,A Delightful Tale for All Ages,"Disclaimer: I am a married 32 year old male with no children.I have been an avid fan of comic books for most of my life, but the abundance of violence, sex and other unsavory material in the genre has scared me away for quite a while. I've been searching for all ages appropriate graphic novels to share with my nieces, nephew and to enjoy myself. I'd heard positive things about Owly and decided to give it a shot.The art is charming and the nearly wordless but surprisingly involved story warms one's heart as it illustrates to children the importance of self sacrifice and not giving in to one's initial impressions. I would heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to please a young audience (I did share it with a friend's young ones after I had read it) and of course even us adults will find it an innocent, enlightening tale.I will be looking for more Owly when I have my own kids to share it with."
3,easy to install,never seem to use them but they do work and look cool. I only have them for the rare occassion when somebody sits in the tiny a?? back seat of my 2011 jeep wrangler.
3,"Inexpensive, cheap. works ok.","The handles have two straps, one, the larger one, is placed behind the rollbar, and the other is placed below the rollbar (you grab the one below the rollbar). The grab handle is the same length as the other strap, so there is really no loop to place your hand into. You have to wedge your hand in between the handle and the rollbar.It's a good price for what you get. When these get stolen, I'll probably buy the exact same ones again."
3,Weak Buckles Break Easily!,These grab handles appear to be well constructed except for the cheap plastic buckles. The first time I tried to cinch up the strap to the velcro one of the plastic buckles snapped rendering the entire handle useless.I will be going to the hardware store tomorrow to find some metal buckles to substitute for these cheap plastic ones.
2,1/4 broke in the first few months,"These are easy to install and comfortable to grip. However, my friend who is around 200 lbs grabbed hold when trying to jump in the Jeep. The stitching gave way and he fell right on his butt.You get what you pay for I guess and I got a laugh, but I don't think I'd buy them again."
4,These are SUPER nice,"I have been in other Wranglers that have cheap handles and these are not cheap ... these are nice, easy to install and useful as well as comfortable in your hand."
1,Cheap,Spend the extra 15 bucks and get yourself a better pair. These are pretty cheap looking. They look like they came out of the dollar store. I still have em on but one of them I had to cut cause it was too long. When I cut it I just screwed up the whole item. Really try not to use them cause they don't look to trusting.
5,No complaints,Exactly what I asked for arrived. Received in plenty of time for Christmas. Will be doing business with them in the future. Thanks!
3,The handles are too big,"I got these handles and they're nice but, in my opinion, they're too big. They're not comfortable to grab on to when you're cruising down the road or really find yourself in that ""Oh, Sh....!"" moment. I got the Rugged Ridge Ultimate Black Grab Handles and really like them better."
5,Very good quality.,Very good quality hand grips. Velcro seems to be good quality also. We ordered 2 sets so we would have handles up front and in the rear. Great product highly recommend.
4,Great for the price,Putting these on my 2013 JKU properly required me to pop off the top to ensure I could really tighten them down. Once strapped on properly I can grab on fully and pull my entire weight (230 lbs) into the Jeep.
3,"Not bad, but there are better options","The price was cheap and it got here THE DAY AFTER I ordered it. I don't like the fact that the handle part is foam, I'd prefer rubber. As to the reviews that state that it broke the first day: I used it to pull myself into the Jeep (175lbs) and it worked fine; it also held up to a full day of holding on to it while wheeling.I'd recommend spending a few more dollars to find a set with rubber grips instead of foam.2 HANDLES PER ORDER."
4,Easy install and nice product,I put this on a 93 Wrangler. installed in about 5 seconds and worked great. You can spend more for a nicer set but these work well and they do what they need to do.
2,not all that great,"I ordered those handle bars because of the price and let me tell you, never again will I go cheap on parts for my wrangler. they look and feel cheap,wouldn't order them again. very disappointed. price is okay I guess,but not worth it."
5,2008 Jeep Wrangler X Two door soft top.,So far so good on these handles installed 6 months ago. For the price you can't ask for anything more. I weigh 235 lbs and use my handle to hoist my body into my driver's seat. Jeep has been raised about a total of 6-7 inches. My handle is working overtime getting my heavy butt in my jeep. Recommend these handles.
4,Grab Handles,Good for passengers in backcountry trails. Hard to come up with more than 6 words let alone 20 or more words.
4,As expected,"These worked fine on my 2007 Wrangler. They do stretch quite a bit so make sure you have them as tight as possible when you attach them. They also seem to support quite a lot of weight from all the guys that use them to climb in. I wouldn't recommend any for the back seat. There isn't really a good position for them if you have a sound bar. There is a spot to fit, but friends have said it makes it awkward to hold."
3,Keep your Money!,"Looks like a nice accessory to help climb in my lifted jeep, but really is no help. Okay for your passenger to hold onto going around curves, but thats about all they are good for. (They are well built with good material)"
4,Does what they are supposed to do -- decent product,"We like to go off trail, and my wife is only about 5' 3"" and like 110 pounds so she needs a little extra grab handle to hold her in place as we meander about. Even in the city, ever get tired of gas stations and shopping malls that don't have connecting parking lots? That's no problem for a Jeep, but curbs and such go bump too... all around good product to keep your wife in her seat. :)"
3,"Versitile, but one was broken","These seem to be good handles, in fact I bought two boxes (for a total of 4 handles) - they come in handy for holding dry cleaning, too! However, one of the handles came out of the box broken. A plactic piece connects the strap to the handle - which is key because if you pull on it, it's this plastic piece that has to take the pressure. That was the only disappointing thing."
5,A Jeep Wrangler Must Have,These are the best bang for the buck for grab handles. I have bought several pair over the last few years for various Jeep Wranglers. They hold up well and are comfortbale. Don't spend $40 for a better set...because there is no better set.
4,Grab Handles,These were a present for my daughter for her 4 door Jeep.They work great for the front seats but she wanted them for thepeople getting in the back seats and they don't fit over the barsin the back bc of the where the speakers are. Maybe there shouldbe a front seat and back seat pair with the back seat pair having a longerstrap? Great price for the item.
4,Just okay,"My son had the green ranger and his mystic racer for a while. For his birthday his uncle sent him this product, the red ranger and mystic racer. My son likes that these are shown on the TV show and now he has two of them to race together. They are very similar to the motorcycles in that the front part of the vehicle shoots off as a projectile. The back colored flame part spins at the push of a button. There are wheels on the bottom of the toy but the idea is for the child to hold these and pretend they are flying in the air. My son enjoys playing with his Mystic Racers but I think his Dragon Morphin Power Ranger toys and the motorcycles get more play time."
3,O...Really?,"These are NOT the original cut Under Armour boxers! (At least not the same ones I purchased from ~2002-2006) The original cut had a midline seam down the back and were much more comfortable. These have a 3 panel construction for the backside which puts a seam down the middle of each of your gluteus maximus...essentially you sit on the seam, not comfortable. Also, the seams catch the pockets of pants/shorts and tend to bunch up...again, not comfortable.Overall, they are still more comfortable most any other boxer out there, but..Please UnderAmour!!...dont mess with a great design! Go back to the original Original cut!"
2,Sized smaller,Cheaper made than past ones purchases and are sized smaller. A few years ago the garments were of better quality.
5,Nice Stove!,"I purchased this stove after years of using my ultra-light, ultra-tiny backpacker stove. I wanted something I could use in the campground, as well as at home, next to my grill. This stove works great, and is the perfect size, when you don't have to worry about stuffing it into a backpack. Highly recommended!"
3,sexy farce,"People familiar only with Himes' cynical, hard-edged crime novels will be surprised by this witty, sexy farce. It's kind of tedious in parts but overall is a lot of fun. Himes must have had a ball writing it."
2,Ok if you have borland C++.....,"This book was ok, but you need borland C++ unless you want to do some major porting... The back said that you only need borland OR microsoft c, but that is a lie. The only reasion I gave it a 4 was becouse of this. You could tell that a program wrote it and not an author. If you want a book on os programing get it"
2,This book is too expensive and has too many errors,"I was disappointed with this book because I felt it was going to be the definitive Old Time Radio show reference book and it certainly was not. It is full of errors and has many misspellings...names of performers...show information in often incorrect (apparently gathered from other book sources and fan magazines, which are highly unreliable). But I was really outraged at the cost of the book. Outrageous for a one volume book. There are other books on old time radio....John Dunning's book,for example, which is much more interesting visally and are entertainly written. Perhaps this book should be revised with a more general audience in mind!"
2,Boringly written and too many errors,"This book has none of the interest, as far as entertainment value is concerned as HOW SWEET IT WAS and THE AMERICAN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF RADIO by Ron Lackmann. It only has entries for shows and no biographies of major radio personalities. I was most disappointed by this fact. The author, is, unfortunately a rather amateurish writer and many of his remarks are not very clear. Where did he do his research? I was not at all pleased with this purchase."
2,It looks better online than in person,"I don't like how the skull breaks in 1/2 from the cap to the brim. In person it looks really strange/stupid. I think the skull should either be on the cap or on the brim. The photo online looks cool but in person it doesn't line up at all. Maybe the one I purchased is defective. I don't know, but the person I bought it for never wears it."
4,Useful information,"I ended up getting a B in the class overall, it's a book full of tons of useful and relevant information to today's first aid needs. There is more information then what I though would be in there originally. It's a very hands on book which I liked a lot"
2,Huh?,"I love Nick Tosches... but this one got away from him. I don't mind riffs and I kind of expect ole' Nick to stray. But I tossed this sucker the fifteenth time I had to wade through a deep study of old testament references and three pages of lineages. Give it a rest. I want to read about the mob. By the time the story kicked in, I was up for a shave and my wine had aged in its glass."
2,Fails to Explain Rothstein,"Although well-written and very interesting, I agree with the other reviewers. I left this work wishing I had learned more about Rothstein."
1,Tosches at His Worst,"This is probably Tosches's weakest book. It seems as if he proposed the book before attempting any research, received the advance, and only then discovered that there was little available information on the subject. The result is a thrown-together book in which Tosches's has to stretch his suppositions way beyond the breaking point in an attempt to connect the mish mash of material included to being this up to book length, and Tosches' tone seems weary, as though he just wants to give the whole thing up and go to bed. Avoid."
1,Worst book I ever read (actually couldn't even finish it),"This book was horrible. It doesn't even warrant 1 star of 5.Half the book is irrelevant to the topic, e.g., first section is about the history of the universe. A large portion of the book is verbatim court proceedings that the ""hard-working"" author copied.I am so sorry I spent money on this."
4,A fitting silicone case,"I got this case because I needed something to protect my new iPod Shuffle. I also got it so it would match my black headphones (I got the black color case.. obviously..) I find that the case works well. It fits the shuffle very nicely. The face buttons are easy to navigate as the volume up/down and forward/back buttons are clearly formed within the silicone case. There is a slight misfit on the back of the case where the clip meets the back of the shuffle, but it's very minute, and doesn't interfere with the overall look and fit of the case; i never really notice it. That why it gets 4 stars and not the full. Overall, I'm happy with the case. It's also a great price."
5,The best book on usability and design,"If Strunk & White had written a book on web usability it would have really been ahead of its time and only half as good as this amazing book by Steve Krug.Insightful, well-written, witty, enjoyable, this is the perfect remedy to the shelves of paper-wasting exercises in ego gratification by self-styled, internationally sought-after design strategists and usability experts.A marvel of concise, genuinely useful writing."
4,Excellent Web Usability book!,"I am a co-author of a Flash usability book. (so I am more than an average usability reader fyi) Steve's book is excellent. The title ""don't make me think"" also applies to his book, it's short and to the point. This book should be required reading for all web designers out there. This book is so well done, it could sit beside your computer and be a quick reference. I really like the images and diagrams, very helpful. This book gives one a snap shot of the basic's of usability. Excellent work! highly recommended!"
4,Highly recommended,"This book is deffinantly worth having, but don't take it as the bible. It's humor is fun, and it doesn't take a huge time investment to read."
5,An author who follows his own advice!,"If I were as articulate as Steve Krug, this review would require very little thought on your part, but would still deliver a thought-provoking message. I just finished reading this book and found it very informative, thought-provoking, and enjoyable. My head is full, but I don't feel the least worn out. I'm fired up and ready to go back and re-design the few websites I'm responsible for the right way. Thanks, Steve!"
3,"That's not all, folks","This book basically deals with how people behave when using the web - they're reading.As an art director for 20 years, and someone who's always been interested on people's behaviour, I can't say this book surprised me. I was expecting more on web behaviour specifically, but found conclusions I've already taken from other medias. Maybe that's because I work too close to it.But the point I didn't like was that the reading ended with the feeling that the author didn't told me all. He has more to say. The book felt somewhat like a teaser for his workshops. Take this now, get more later.Has its goods shots, but the rabbit doesn't come out of the hat."
3,slow,book is in good condition. the seller just saved money on posting and it took forever to get to Hawaii.oh well I finally got it.
3,Don't buy if you have experience or common sense.,The book was a bit disappointing for me it's by itself not very user friendly information is not organized very logical too much pictures and very little information.
1,DONT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMON SENSE,"This book consists of 195 worthless pgs including the index. I must have said ""Duh!"" more than 15 times in the first 75 pages. It is a book that makes you say ""I guess an author is born every minute!"" There were so many things written in the book that a person with half a brain cell would say, no s#&t sherlock. The only reason why I finished reading the book is because 1. I wanted to write an unbiased review on amazon and 2. I had some time alone in sitting on the can."
4,Good book I am glad I read it.,"I liked this book a lot. I liked the way the author rewrote some web pages and then displayed them so the reader could understand better. This book made me rethink my stand on pop-up menus and reexamine taglines. The author wrote this book for beginners and advanced users. So yes Mr. Krug does talk about how good tabs are for navigation. But aren't they. The only thing that did not interest me a whole lot was the last four chapters which were about web design teams, how to do usability testing and then what to do with the results. This is only a hobby for now and I have no budget. But in the author's defense he does talk about how to do testing on 10 cents a day. I think this book has helped my site and I am glad that I bought it."
3,Good for beginners,"I bought and read this book a few years ago, and when I picked it up for a second read-through last week, I realized that even though the book deals with ""timeless"" topics, it is starting to be a bit dated. Especially the examples and illustrations put it out of date.The text and thoughts behind the process are still valid, but needs better reference material to be relevant for today. If you can pick it up cheap, then it is still a good read/buy though."
5,Great resource for web usability,"This book really needs to be read cover to cover to understand its full meaning and to get a good understanding of Web usability. It helps you understand what testing methods need to be taken, what's good, what bad, and what to think about when designing navigation for a web site. I've been developing web sites since 1995, and it opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about things!"
5,Great Book!,I have learned a great deal from this book. I highly recommend this books for people looking to improve their website design skills.
5,usability mini-book,"If you don't have time but want to know what usability is about then this is the book for you. It's a good help for people approaching this subject for the firs time and it places milestones in the head of the reader.For the ""professionals"" is a good book the keep on the desk, both as a weapon to support your thoughts with clear examples to clients both not to forget the basics (I've seen it happening more than once). So if I should save just one book out of the thousands written about the subject I would save this one."
5,Exactly what I needed,"Filled with the kind of humor I ""get"", the concepts are simple and direct.Our site was due for an update, and its format will change due to some of the ""forehead slapping"" that occured as I realized my mistakes.Enjoyable and worthwhile readP.S. One spelling error on page 32."
5,A eye-opener of a book.,"Aside from being a beautifully designed book that is well written and chock full of insight about how people react to websites (and life in general)... this book is a marvel. There are examples of websites that just make it hard for people to get the information they need -- and specific ways to fix these problems. And on top of all the great info is a detailed guide to performing your own usability study without spending thousands of dollars. This book is an eye-opener, and will give any website designer a distinct advantage over the competition."
2,Only for Beginners - Light on Substance,"I've been a usability engineer/information architect for 8 years and have read many books on both GUI and web design. I'm sorry to report that this book was disappointing. It took me only a few hours to breeze through and I came away with very little that was new to me and with the perception that this book was light on substance. Perhaps this is because I have been in this field for so long. However, I just finished reading Jeff Johnson's ""GUI Bloopers"" and, even after designing GUIs for so many years, I learned so much from Jeff's book. If you are new to this field, Krug's book will help but make sure to read ""Designing Web Usability"" by Nielsen, ""Information Architecture for the World Wide Web"" by Rosenfeld and Morville, ""Designing Large Scale Web Sites"" by Sano, and ""Web Navigation"" by Jennifer Fleming. I also recommend Johnson's book on GUI design. So many GUI Design Principles are directly applicable to good web site design."
5,Simple and yet so effective,"If you are fed up with reading yet another version of the same ""how to attract gazillion visitors to your website"" story, this is THE book for you. Steve Krug makes an excellent job explaining how users perceive information on the net. Even more surprising is the fact the he does not offer a universal solution to solving usability problems. He just explains how to observe visitor's behaviour and what to make of this observation. How you will solve a specific problem is left to your judgment -- your common sense."
5,Oooh lala!! BUY THIS BOOK.,"Basically, I am dying for a sequal. This was the best book for usability I have read so far. Most of the books put me to sleep within the first chapter. For those of us designers who have ADD, this is a great book. It reads fast, and it is educational. Whoever said it was obvious...just ignore that review. I give it to all of my clients that want to force me into doing something I don't agree with with POOR web usability. I LOVE YOU STEVEN KRUG! PLEASE WRITE ANOTHER BOOK TO ENLIGHTEN US ALL!"
2,"Common sense may mean ""what you already know.""","I found this book way too basic, and I'm not a web designer by any stretch of the imagination. I think most of the principles found within can be understood simply through the process of using the web over a few years. For example, here's some breaking news from Krug's book: ""_tabs_ are a good idea!"" Gee, could that possibly be why every other major site uses them? Guess what else? _Amazon.com_ has a successful user interface!Don't buy this book. There is very little groundbreaking information here. Useit.com and the Yale web design guide, along with the O'Reilly book on information architecture, are far more useful for ideas on usability. I think this book stands as an interesting relic of the years 1998-2000, during which there were simply far too many people designing e-commerce sites, and so inevitably creating too many bad sites."
3,What happened to the WinterChill series ?,"I don't know what happened to this series. They started off one way and ended up another. This cd is nice don't get me wrong but there is very little diversity ! All these songs are accoustic with bare drums or just plain boring. What happened to the Winterchill 2 sound? When the series began they use to show a diverse blend of electronic's and hiphop/TripHop sounding tracks. Now everything souunds like it almost come off the same album or band. The 1st 5 songs on this Cd are beautiful ! Especially the ""Slovo"" song ! But after that it all starts to run together and sound like one long theme song. I think ""Breathe"" close to the end of disc one picks up a bit ! But disc 2 I heard barely anything that caught my attention. ""Sway & Beautiful"" are very catchy and strong songs. But anyway overall compared to the 1st 2 Winterchill efforts the last couple have shown no diversity. I think this will be my last purchase."
3,If you like your music on the pretty side...,"The previous Winter Chill compilation (06.02), labelled as ""The Darker Side of Chill"", had a good mix of interesting, offbeat chillout music. Unfortunately, this new one aims to be much more middle-of-the-road. Many of the tracks, most of which feature female vocalists, seem to have been chosen for their generic, cloying blandness. It's not bad if you like your music on the pretty side, and there's some good material here, but Winter Chill 06.02 was more adventurous."
4,Pretty Good Book with a Pretty Good Price,"This wasnt a life changing, grip your heart kind of book, but it did give awesome insight to people in the bible and their experiences with crying out. I would put this book down and pick it up the next week, put it down pick it up the next week- so it wasnt that captivating either but it also wasnt a waste of money. The author of this book has all his facts for the title, but I didnt feel like crying out after reading it. I know from the experience of crying out (even before reading this book) that it does work to get Gods attention so dont give up even if you didnt like this book."
5,Excellent read,This is an excellent book for those who believe in the power of prayer. It will change your perspective and maybe change your life. God Bless.Randall
4,The power of crying out,This book was a great reminder of the importance of letting God know how much we need Him in our daily lives.
1,Power of Crying Out,"This is the most bogus book on prayer I have ever read.The gist of the 96pp is this ""Pray out loud and God will hear you and answer your prayer""Gothard takes you on a walk through several verses showing people praying out loud and getting their results.He never discusses their spiritual position at that time or God's intention to use them to fulfill His will. For those who desire a biblical understanding on prayer, save your pennies and purchase a more enlightening book like Charles Stanley ""Handle with Prayer"""
3,Book Power of crying out,I read this book a few weeks ago. It was not special to me. But then again the book can be different for different people at different times in their life. It just wasn't that special to me.
1,SILLY AND SHALLOW,This book offers a shallow simplistic and legalistic formula. It offers false hope and is bound to disappoint.
4,Short But Intriguing,"I had resisted reading this book because although I respect Bill Gothard I had disagreed with some of his earlier writings. But this simple, short little book that expresses only a single theme---""God really likes for us to pray aloud to Him""---did end up touching me and encouraging me to be me more vocal in my prayers. ""The need to cry out is a humbling reminder of my total inability to accomplish anything significant for God"" ""To cry out is to expressly acknowledge that the problem I'm facing is greater than the wisdom, ability, or strength I possess."" Its only weakness is common to many of Gothard's writings, in that they are long on deducing doctrine from case histories and single verses and short on foundation in reformed systematic theology."
4,it happened under a black light,"i loved this book. it is filled with stories of the real days of early woodstock. it spans from the time of the native americans up to the woodstock festival of 1969, which i was a part of on the medical teams. it is unique to read a book under a black light, the print glows in the dark and it is not radioactive like so many other things! the upbeat stories are interesting and factual. it explains the real meaning and the worldwide phenomenon of woodstock that connects to certain universal truths."
5,A story of true dedication and honour for one's country,"This story is, of course, about Yoni Netanyahu who gave his all to Israel. The book is captivating as the author seems to guide the reader through Yoni's life. One sees the mental aspects to his personality, in particular his feelings of army life (to which he was 100% committed) and his aspirations to study at Harvard University (which he did, but in broken parts due to his commitments with the Israeil army). The book describes in detail the roles that Yoni had in the army throughout his career, including those during the Yom Kippur War and the 6 Day War, not to mention the fateful night in Entebbe. I recommend this book to people who want to learn about the history of Israel and about a remarkable man whose endurance and personality were, in my opinion, unrivalled in the 20th century."
3,Not the book he wanted to publish,"Max Hastings, the author of this, writes of this book in his memoir Going To The Wars. In the chapter entitled Yoni he describes how he was approached on behalf of the Israelis to write this book and did so happily, giving up his journalism to research it, having been assured of full co-operation from official sources. His book was then rejected by the family who did not approve of the picture he painted of the man and the government who did not like the picture he painted of the Israeli special forces and they refused to pay him. Facing bankruptcy and unable to publish on his own without their agreement he says he eventually had to compromise and this book is the result. For anyone particularly interested in the subject it would be worth reading that chapter for sense of the fuller picture the author wanted to convey."
5,Will the 21st Century Be the Century of Buckminster Fuller?,"This is an excellent anthology of the writings of Bucky Fuller, some of which are hard to get, with introductions by individuals ranging from Arthur C. Clark to Valerie Harper.A Renaissance man--Fuller was an inventor, scientist, architect, poet, philosopher--Fuller may be the person whose hope, vision, and genius may propel this new century to ever greater heights!"
3,A compilation of chapters from 20 Bucky's books,"This compilation by Bucky's former architectural partner - Zung consists of chapters selected from 20 of Bucky's 23 books on topics ranging from education and environment to engineering and the Lord's Prayer, each with a new introduction by Arthur C. Clarke, Steve Forbes, Calvin Tomkins, Martin Meyerson, Harold W. Kroto, Valerie Harper, Arthur L. Loeb, E. J. Applewhite, and others. Altogether, this book provides an overview of the career, and is an introduction to the man and his thoughts. 51 B&W; illustrations.Funny thing is to look at the 3rd picture titled ""Close-up of inner section of the model"" in the English Wikipedia article about Kepler to see where Bucky took his inspiration for the geodesic dome from."
4,Beware of 'backfriends' Amusing,"This is an amusing collection of the 'snubs, sneers, slights and effronteries' by the 'Great Cham'. Lynch arranges them in alphabetical order and adds his own interesting commentary on their origins. In writing for instance of 'backfriends' that is of friends who behind the back to others speak about their friend in ways not friendly at all. He tells us the story of Boswell's resentment of Hester Thrale whom Johnson gave more time with him, and his revenge on her by filling his 'Life of Johnson' with insulting remarks about her. These led her to say that if all friends are like Johnson one should have no friends at all.This is an amusing work especially for those who love the study of Language and all its unending varieties and duplicities."
2,"Insults? Maybe, but very mild","The book is a useful guide to the way its many words were once used. I looked for an occasional surprise in the word list, but didn't find many."
3,"Ok, but not really ""mastery""","I wish I had known that this was more of a list of self-help ideas for language learning. What I wanted was an in-depth vocabulary trainer, living in Germany and trying to learn a depth of language as quickly as possible. It is helpful, just doesn't measure up to its blurb."
3,good but,It moves very fast (if I didn't know some German already I'd be pretty lost). I didn't know it but it works with a text book too (could explain why I'd be lost). Could be more creative in helping you learn vocab.
1,Buy flash cards,"This is a very poor way to learn vocabulary. Much time spent to get you to try to figure out a few words. You will learn more German faster with any of the audio courses (e.g., Pimsleur, Living Language). If you already know some German and want to expand your vocabulary, buy some flash cards and you will learn more words, faster than with this dull, inappropriate tool."
4,Pretty much how it looks,"The picture in Amazon looks pretty much like what you get, not much more to say about it. Seems sturdy enough."
4,monkey mask good,"I bought this monkey mask for a friend's wedding, this was the brides mask and the groom had a bigger hairier one. They are for keeping the marriage lively, not for the ceremony. ;) Excellent value on the mask, bride loved it."
4,Is Too Much Honesty a Bad Thing? Maybe...,"The most accurate, honest book about the day-to-day activities of a midlist writer that you'll ever read. If you're currently a freelance writer, you'll nod your head in agreement--even though the book is nearly 20 years old now, things haven't changed all that much in the writing trade (except for this whee little thing called the Internet...). I wouldn't recommend it for aspiring writers, however, as it's tedious and will, in the words of another reviewer, do more to dissuade you from writing than encourage you."
1,"Dissapointing, Tedious read.",Epstein would have benefited from writing this book with an actual author. She goes off on tangents that could be pulled from any basic history book and contribute little to her actual story of her mother's history. It seems she took the 12 pages her mother wrote and inserted a ton of filler to make it into a 300 page novel. Save your time and read something else.
5,Every daughter should read this book,"We read Helen Epstein's ""Where She Came From"" for our book group, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The book has so many threads: Wonderful characters you wish you could meet in person; A view of the history of eastern Europe that is colorful and compelling; The chilling face of centuries of European anti-Semitism; Helen's personal story of discovery. It reads like a mystery at times and a love letter at others. The writing style is very clear and pleasant to read - the best of personal journalism. Having read the library's copy, I bought one of my own to share with my own family and friends."
3,So-So Purchase,"The arms of the chair do not fit snugly against the back. When I called the company, the helpful Customer Rep said she would see if they were still making this model and call me back. She returned the call as promised (good thing!) and there were no extra parts or chairs in the warehouse. I decided to keep it. My granddaughter loves the chair and the wood is very dictionurable and the design is nice, too. No doubt in my mind the chair will last a long time, I just wish the parts would have fit more snugly when we put it together."
3,Good but not my favorite.....,Good but not my favorite.....the price is crazy high for eight ounces in my opinion....Spot Organics No More Itch Organic Dog Shampoo - 8 oz....My groomer has a better product...I won't be buying this again!~
2,Missing CD,"The product description said that the book came with a 10 track CD. When finally received, no CD was included."
2,Difficult to get through,"I picked this one up at a garage sale and found it very difficult to finish. Apparently, a group of terrorists is damaging the water supply in Turkey that feeds neighboring countries. Failure to provide the water to these countries will result in war.Mike Zimmit, is an environmentalist that gets pulled into this plot and tries to save the day in James Bond fashion. I had a lot of problems with his character. He is very abrasive and literally attacks a guest on a television talk show because he doesn't like what the guy preaches. Though he does a heck of a lot worse to the guest than Russell Crowe recently did to a hotel clerk, nothing happens to him.I found him a very difficult ""hero"" to root for and really lost interest in this book about halfway through. The book seems to indicate that this is the first in a series of stories about Zimmit and his group. I definately hope not!"
3,Interesting but....,"Not bad for Mr. Sherbaniuk's first novel. I had a few groans at the awkward writing style and some laughs at the many terrible similes e.g. ""Her eyes burned like violet laser beams through a plume of cigarette smoke"" and ""He squinted up into the sky, glowing like an inverted enamel blue bowl."" Many of the characters were also either cliché or not very believable.Alas, the story's theme of Genetically Modified Organisms for warfare is compelling and a frightening scenario is presented. We are left with the question of not if, but when something like this will happen. In an unstable world we live in today, I shudder at the possibilities.Hopefully the sequel, The Devil's Casket, will be published. It was due to come out in 2004, but I've heard nothing else on it. I look forward to see how Mr. Sherbaniuk's novel-writing will improve.As an aside though, I think William Petersen (Grissom on CSI) would play an excellent Zammit in a movie adaptation. ;)"
4,Works well,This cracker is very effective. I just wish the walnuts on our tree were bigger. It is a lot of work to crack the nuts without getting bits of shells mixed in.
2,Could not crack pecans.,"On the first attempt to crack pecans, pistons shifted and handle bent. Cracker is not designed for tough chores. Wish I didn't spend the money. My Channellocks pliers works just a good. Need to send back and tell them to keep it."
2,Cheap copy.,"Anticipated an old fashioned Reed's Rocket R-300. Have cracked many 1000's of nuts with one when I still had pecan trees. Greatly disappointed with this one. Others have mentioned that contruction is not as pictured, having only two screws on the wooden base instead of four. The base is only 2 X 8 instead of the original 3 X 9 making it less stable. The handle is only 9.5"" long, fulcrum to tip, instead of the original's much longer handle. The handle length makes a huge difference in the leverage, which makes a huge difference in how easy it is to crack a nut. The overall construction is lighter weight. The final insult to this consumer is the Amazon description of being made in America and the box being labeled ""America's Finest"". Box is stamped in small letters as ""CHINA"". Cannot recommend this unit. Will purchase a vintage R-300 from an auction or antique site. Will return this."
3,Well enough for most nuts,"This unit works well enough for most nuts availible at groceries, English Walnuts, Pecans, Filbert/Hazelnuts, Almonds, Brazil Nuts, and a few Hickories as well as Acorns. I would not attempt using this on Black/American Walnuts or other very tough nuts. I use a small hobby vise bolted to a sturdy work surface for these.My father felt that he could use it on a Black Walnut and broke the unit. The construction leaves something to be desired but for all 'soft shelled' nuts its sufficiant.I think I will be making myself a far better unit as opposed to buying another but all in all. I felt it was reliable with common store bought nuts."
4,Cracker rocks!,This makes bulk nut cracking a breeze. I liked it so much I got one for my Mom and she liked it too.
1,very dissapointed,"I bought this product for the sole reason that it said 'Made in the USA' in the description. To my dismay, upon opening the box, I read that it said 'Made in China'. Clearly, the supposed quality of the product was not there and I could not have been more disappointed. Had I been able to give a zero star rating, I would have. This is total false advertising."
1,Disappointing Quality,"Unsatisfactory product, returned it. Wood looks poorly finished and has splinters. Hardware is not even handyman-tool quality. It doesn't work easily (needs assembly) nor well and is not attractive enough to keep on display, yet too cumbersome to drag out each time you want to serve a bowl of shell-on nuts. This one was made in China; maybe previously USA-made products were better; I can't understand how Cook's Illustrated could have liked it; I would not recommend this current one. I hope Cook's can find a better recommendation."
4,it is made pretty sturdy for the price,"and works much better than the cheap $12.00 ones that i have had in the past. don't know how they'll rate against the $60- $100 ones, but so far we are quite satisfied"
2,The handle is easy to be broken.,"The handle is easy to be broken and hard to fix. If you can fix handle issue, it is fine."
5,Superior nut cracker,Even better than I expected it to be. Makes shelling walnuts almost fun. I don't have to clean up walnut shells all over the kitchen after shelling nuts for baking.
3,Not as good as other models,"I borrowed a Reed's Rocket nutcracker from my cousin because I had a good yield from my pecan tree this year. It belonged to her father, and I'm guessing it may have been at least 20 years old. It worked well so I ordered this model (Harold Imports Reed's Rocket). It doesn't work as well. It tends to produce fewer intact pecan halves. In fact, it was rare to get an entire pecan half. I ordered another model of the Reed's Rocket, which was more like the one I borrowed. It had a wider base than the Harold Imports model and it worked like the borrowed one."
3,Reed Rocket,"It's okay, But I would like to have one made in the good old U.S.A. like the origal ones. I have one of the origal ones, and like it a whole lot better."
1,sorry I ordered it.,"If I wanted chopped nuts, I could use a hammer. I sent three messages, asking for a shipping label to return this item and get a refund.Each time you use a different size pecan, the mechanism has to be adjusted. Not once, after trying over and over, did I get a clean cracked pecan .The fact that I was ignored and told the complaint was resolved, tells me I was totally being ignored. So I am out $$ for something I cannot and will not use."
2,Item not as pictured,"I just received this item and it is not as pictured here. The pic shows 2 screws on one side holding the mechanism to the base (I assume there are 2 on the other), what I received has only one on each side. Item pictured shows all metal parts chomed, item delivered has lower metal parts coated, not chromed. Construction is flimsy, most parts are not machined but cast or stamped, rivets holding the pivot points together are loose and sloppy. This item may be fine for cracking a few soft-shelled nuts, but in my opinion will not hold up to anything harder than the thinnest shelled pecan. I will be returning this item.To the sellers credit, shipping was amazingly quick, but I'm still out the $6.50 they charged."
1,Not built to crack black walnuts,"I purchased this item specifically to crack black walnuts, which are hard nuts to crack. The rocket failed on the first attempt. More specifically, the handle bent, the screw assembly cross-threaded, and the metal base of the nutcracker bent. Thus, I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere if you're fixing to crack black walnuts."
1,NOT made in USA,"I just received this from Amazon today. The box says 'China' on it. I'm not totally against Chinese manufactured products, but I am when items claim to be American made. I'm not claiming this product works or doesn't as I am returning it due to the erroneous 'Made In USA' claim."
2,Harold Imports Reed's Rocket Nutcracker,"I was disappointed in this nutcracker. I had small hazelnuts to crack, and the handle bent out of shape right away, probably because the barrel didn't adjust to a small enough size to get the force necessary to crack them. It just didn't seem to be constructed out of quality materials."
5,Simple and efficient,It was exactly as advertised. Easy to use and nice looking also. Stores back in box for neat storage. Couldn't ask for a better one. Hardly any nuts come out broken up. The adjustment for different size nuts is so easy a caveman could do it.
5,Glad to add this to my collection!,"I bought the first volume and this one, too. It's fun to hear people play like they mean it."
2,Gagged my Daughter,I have a particularly small child. She was 6 lbs at birth but completely healthy. I purchased this item in hopes to get some relief for my sore nipples. The product is bigger than a bottle nipple. It's to wide and sticks out to far. It gagged her so she would not use it. I'm sure it probably works for some people but I had a Medela Nipple shield with my first child that covered all of the areola and was a better fit. This one is bulky. I may have ordered the wrong size so I would say contact a lactation consultant or your hospital's doula for help. The one I used that worked (4 years ago) was given to me in the hospital. I had to order this one online since we are military and stationed overseas. I did like that the baby gets more skin to skin contact with this item...so if your child isn't a petite little one...they may like it.
1,No good,My son has had poor latch issues that have made BFing difficult and painful. I had hoped that this shield would help but it is so big and bulky that he can't latch on at all with this thing. My baby isn't a small baby either. He was 12 lbs at birth (11 now) and is very healthy. So for us this was a waste of money and I can't recommend it all.
2,Didn't work for me,My daughter didn't take to these at all. She got frustrated quickly. These did help with pain while she was trying to latch on but since she would only make a few attempts before she was in hysterics we didn't use them. I am now exclusively pumping and bottle feeding. Works better for us and much less pain for me!
3,didn't like them,"A friend swore by these to help with sore nipples. I however, did not like them nor did my baby. They did not help with the soreness and my baby would not latch on for more than a few seconds when I had them on. I gave them 3 stars because I think that they work well with premature babies to help them to latch on (I am a labor and delivery nurse and have seen them used for this purpose)."
5,Very Helpful,My wife was having a hard time to breastfeed. The nipple shield solve the problem and helped to reduce the pain. I would recommend this product to every mom that is having pain or hard time to breastfeed!
2,Go for Sony 18-250 mm instead,"I looked at this lens, but quickly realised that the Sony 18-250 is a superior solution. For only USD 50 extra you get a lense that:- Reaches 75mm further (using 35mm equivalents)- Was introduced to the market two years later.- Is only marginally larger"
1,Blah,"This book could have been a lot more interesting. For instance, if you read through the Editorial Review on this page, you can see there's potential in the story, but reading the actual book is just a waste of time. As Home himself puts it in this novel: Bad literature is bad literature is bad literature.Also, I'm a Finn and read the book in Finnish. I can't help but wonder why this book was translated to my language in the first place. It's not Home's best and the neverending gibberish about Scotland's stone circles and obscure forgotten writers has nothing to give to us."
3,Mediocre,While Stewart Home does show strong writing ability I feel that it was not utilized very well with this story. It is generally difficult to write sex scenes very well and he does not do it very well. The narrator has no mind of her own and after a couple of chapters in the books becomes annoying. I think that Mr. Home secretly has a desire to be a book reviewer rather than an author. You might find the book worth reading if it is your desire to be annoying and pretentious.
2,Just fluff,"It was visually cute, but I was interested in more of an instructional book. The description is misleading. This isn't much more than an inspirational coffee table book."
2,Doggie Yoga,"This was a relatively cute book, but please beware that it is not truly instructional and is not meant to teach one how to facilitate a Doggie Yoga class. This book would make a good gift for the yoga aficionado who also loves dogs and might be entertaining for a few minutes. I would have preferred to see a greater variety of dogs as well. However, I understand the author's vision in spotlighting only four in order to develop character. I would not pay full price for this book."
5,Delightful Book.,"If you've ever done yoga and you have a great appreciation for the zen of dogginess, you will enjoy this book. Even if you just like dogs, it should give you a laugh, but you'll probably appreciate it more if you're familiar with the ways of yoga.It is definitely for people with a sense of humor--if you are looking for the definitive book on yoga positions and expect to teach yourself how to get into the perfect positions, well, go take a class from a human who can make sure you are properly aligned.This book is fun, relaxing, and may inspire you to do yoga...but the most therapeutic thing about it is the laughter."
3,Witty book for hip dog owners,Quite witty book of photos of young dogs in poses which look like familar yoga poses. It has imaginary commentary from the dogs.Dog owners who do yoga will bark with delight.
1,Doggie Yoga not for real,This is a silly book and not worth the paper it is printed on. Not funny enough to be a joke and not real enough to be a useful tool of any sort.
2,Let me think... How can I exploit the yoga craze?.... Doga!,"I picked up this book expecting it to be yet another crass attempt to exploit the ancient art and science of yoga for personal material gain and, well, I was pretty much right. I imagine this book being dreamed up by a yoga teacher thinking, ""Hmmm... How can I make a name for myself in this yoga game and maybe squeeze out a couple bucks while I'm at it?"" Perhaps I give too much credit to the author. Though the book contains some cute bits that doggie lovers will surely enjoy, ""Doga"" adds nothing to either the great bodies of yoga or pet literature. In fact, it may even detract from both. I give the book two stars because, who knows, maybe dogs will enjoy reading ""Doga,"" or chewing it."
1,Immediately Broken,"I opened the package and read the directions. Step one was to press the button and extend the foot holders. As I did that, a plastic washer broke into two pieces and fell onto the bed. One set of foot supports now spin around freely, making them unstable and unusable. Returning the item.Also, this device is not suitable for people over size 8. It's made for tiny, skinny people. The handles do not open wide enough for anyone who is even slightly plump. I do not recommend this device at all for ""normal"" people."
4,Quick relief!,"I have been having lower back pain for most of my life. I've been using this for about three weeks now and have without a doubt experienced relief and just a better feeling over all where my lower back is concerned. Is it a miracle device? Probably not for everyone, but when I use it I can here and feel my back pop each morning and each night. Slowly the pain in my legs have all but disappeared.For the price, if you are experiencing pain or are trying to just get the best stretch of your back and don't want to have to hang upside down this is worth a try."
2,not helpful,"I found this item to be difficult to use if you have back pain, which is why you buy it. When your back hurts, you can't easily maneuver locking in your feet, or unlocking them from a reclining position. The idea was good, but in practice, not worth it."
5,Back stretcher,"This item is constructed VERY WELL. It appears very durable and it really helps my low back. Folds up nice and small and it unfolds easily and quickly. When I bought it I thought ""If this doesn't work I am going to return it."" ..well I still have it and plan to keep it for many years of use. I recommend it as an aid to reduce back pain & I have recommended it to some co-workers when they asked me about what was helping my low back pain. Works nicely."
4,Nice Stretch,"I play a lot of golf and always struggle with lower back pain and stiffness. This product does a nice job of relieving some of this stiffness. It is nice because with other inversion tables the blood that rushes to the head, limits how long I want to stay inverted. Also this product is easy to take along with you on your next golf trip. Could give a little more of a feeling of relief, but overall a good product."
3,It's okay I bought d inversion table for me but I don't keep with me because I was so sick I could walk,"Than my sister took me to her house to take care of me so I bring me inversion table there ,but when I came back Home I realise that I still needs that so I was looking online and I got d ps3Is good because is small, but as others revewers said ,u need to have lot strength in your armsAnd d handles is hurt too u need to put some"
3,Teetwer Hang Ups 3 review,Don't know how hard to push. Afraid push too hard may cause back damage. Otherwise it is a convenient strectcher.
3,Looks Great.,"The pill box is quite beautiful, but it is more of a decorative piece than a functioning, transportable pill box. The locking/opening mechanism came loose after just a few days. At this point, it won't lock fully. Perhaps it would hold up better if you didn't carry it with you - even in your purse or messenger bag."
4,Taking Melody AM to the next level.,"I must admit that I was a bit aprehensive after reading the reviews and even after the first listen. The more I listen, the more I love it. It truly shows the growth from Melody AM, with only faint reminders but a common je ne sais quoi. I hate to compare or categorize music like this, but for descriptive purposes, OK. I hear so many different things: One cannot deny the resemblance to Air's Moon Safari, but add a little Gus Gus, DM, Erasure, a little BT but some tracks infuse todays R&B sound as well. Yeah, it's different from Melody but the two are not mutually exclusive and I would recommend it for any Royksopp fan as well as anyone looking for something modern and fun and easy to listen to. Go directly to ""Follow My Ruin""."
3,Not the old Royksopp I knew and loved,"After hearing the first 9 songs, I was thoroughly disappointed. Where's the heavy beats and the risky melody?? I feel like I'm listening to a trance mix of the Pet Shop Boys done by Paul Oakenfold; translation: sounds like everybody and their brother. They obviously spent some time writing lyrics and singing more this time, and in the excitement of it all, they forgot to do something interesting with the music. They've taken a step back since their first album. What a shame......"
1,Just didn't expect this,"As one of the reviewers said if you really liked MELODY AM, you might be up for a surprise here. I suggest you listen to this album very carefully before buying it.From mellow electro of MELODY AM, they went to electro-POP with an aftertaste of the 80's for many songs in THE UNDERSTANDING.Sometimes, I hear some sounds of Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, and others in the after-taste portion of the songs.Music is always hard to describe, that's the best I can do.Their songs 11-12 of THE UNDERSTANDING are probably the ones I prefer, still they're not brilliant, and #11 reminds me of AIR."
5,Chilled Vocal Album,"The Undestanding is a great chilled vocal album, and precisely that is what makes it different from Melody am. This guys are pros, you won't be dissapointed by the vocals.This one is (i'd dare to say) an experiment from royksopp on the vocals. You'll listen a female and male vocals with nice lyrics throughout the album.In my opinion they did very well with them! Even though you might expect a less vocal album, i guarantee your satisfaction.4 traxx on this album are rated 5stars on my media player, but the track i just can't stop listening to is 49%. It's a continuos (something like soft drum & bass) build up during those 5:12min. Excelent male vocals and very touching lyrics.Melody AM did not had as many vocals as The Understanding, keep that in mind before buying this album."
3,The understanding of why different could be mediocre,"Fist of all, Royksopp's newest album ""The Understanding"", does not suck by any means. It is a great album that shows the musical duo's depth. It also shows their ability to evolve and make a sound that is entirely unique (just like with their first album.)But just like with evolution, there is always something that gets left behind. In the case of The Understanding, it seems as though the older, raw, retro-synthish, old-skool electro-popish Royksopp that we all came to love so much, grew up and matured into something that we arent sure how to deal with. Maybe I will learn to love the new evolved Royksopp as much as the old one, hopefully. But I dont think I could ever give up those days of listening to Melody A.M. on vinyl,,,,,,,ahhhh how nostalgic! But hey, dont think that the new album is not worth picking up, any true Royksopp fan needs it....So check it out, and maybe you will see that I was wrong!"
5,great summer record,i can't say enough how much i've enjoyed this record. i've listened to it just about every day and i'm still loving it.
5,beautiful calendar,"Susan's work is exquisite and this calendar allows a view of a different work each month. The paper is solid and the calendar blocks themselves are clear, large and include special dates and moon info. There is also a poem at the bottom of each page. Love it!"
1,All pieces arrive broken,I bought 2 american dj light packs. the first one when I open the box and tried all items everything worked perfect. The second one I open the box one week later and all items had problems. The colored lights had some problems. Both cooling fans did not run and the inside motor did not run. The strobe light when it turns on the light run imperfectly. The fog machine was broken inside.
