4,Very comfortable at first...,"...and then after cruising the mall for a bit my feet still felt tired, or after a trip to Costco. It was more comfortable when it first arrived. After wearing it for about 3 months, the sole wasn't as ""bouncy"" anymore, but over all, it is still a comfortable pair of shoes and definitely worth then less than $[...] I paid for."
3,"cute, but didn't fit... sizing way off.","Sadly, I had to return these. They were cute, but didn't fit... sizing was way off base. They were too short and too narrow. I sometimes have trouble with shoes (M width) being a bit too wide, so this was a real shock. I would have liked to try a half size up, and/or possibly a wider shoe, but didn't know what combination might have worked and didn't want to keep paying return shipping fees. Also, Amazon's return doesn't offer an exchange (size) option, so I gave up. Disappointing experience."
2,Not what I expected,"They were ok I guess I was looking for more of a sneaker type slip on, this was very light, as I know Easy Spirit's are but it seemed a little flimsy. Just not for me"
3,"eh, it's a textbook","This textbook is clear, but the content doesn't help the entertainment value. As far as college texts go, though, it's pretty useful."
3,Inspirational Reading,"I wasn't expecting much from the plain book cover, but was surprised by the content. Written simply, Lonergan captures the essence of the man and his mind over matter attitude. Some subjects just don't need much enhancing. Very inspirational!"
5,The best new show from last year (now with extras!),Community has got to be the best new show from last year and this DVD set makes it even better. The outtakes alone would be worth the price.
5,HYSTERICAL!!,"I love ""Community"" and it signature brand of wacky, off-the-wall comedy with an eclectic cast and damn fine writing. ""Modern Warfare"" is their crown jewel in their series. The ""Soup""'s Joel McCale joins the school's paintball competition to win the college's highly coveted 'free pass'. The mayhem that follows is a cliche-riddled, flat-out-pace, twisty 22-minutes that should've won the Emmy for best episode. Every moment is goofy & crazy mixed with a genius script of witty dialog that had me laughing from start to finish. And the ending? Sheer brilliance! Buy this episode and you won't regret it!"
5,Great show,"I love community, it is one of the best written and well acted shows on TV. Dan Harmon has a created one the best satires with heart on television."
5,"Ah man, I could watch the 1st Season non-stop... Classic.",The 1st Season of Community really shows how the show evolved. I love how you can see the actors learn their roles and start blending into the group. What can I really say? There's no reason to not get the 1st Season on DVD.
5,Surprisingly Clever,"I skipped the premier of ""Community"" last fall. The promos didn't make the show seem very interesting. However, I happened to spot it on Hulu a few weeks later and decided to give it a try. Needless to say, I burned through all the back episode in no time and couldn't wait for more. The show is funny, touching and intelligent. ""Community"" struggled a bit to find its voice during this first season, but by the time they got to the ""epic"" paintball episode, all the pieces were solidly in place.Don't miss the beginning of this journey! Get the DVD. It's the next best thing to enrolling in Greendale Community College yourself!"
5,One of the greatest comedies of all time,"I come from a time when Seinfeld, Everbody Loves Raymond, and Frasier swept the Emmy's for comedy awards. Recently I was depressed by the horrible comedies on TV and was kept in the dumps watching reruns of these great oldies. Two new shows have become the new Seinfeld/ELR/Frasier: Community and Modern Family. These two shows surprise me every week with how absolutely hilarious they are! This one is for slightly older people (teen and up) mainly because younger ones won't be able to keep up with the jokes. Modern Family is the choice for a show you can watch with, well, the whole [modern] family. This is an early review so if they end up releasing this set with all 20 episodes of season one you SHOULD DEFINITELY buy it from Amazon.com. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
3,"I love the show, but I won't buy it until it's on Blu-Ray.","Community is one of the funniest shows on TV now, and it is broadcast in High Def, so why would I want it on DVD?? Once the studio releases it on Blu-Ray, I'll buy it. I don't want to pay for inferior quality DVD images for a recent TV show. There is no good reason for them not to relase this show on Blu-Ray. No excuse."
1,Lifeless humor,"My wife teaches at a community college and my son also attends. I was hoping for some clever, relatable, and warm humor from this series but found none. The characters are comic book fabrications. The alleged wit and cleverness of this show seems to consist of the ability of the characters to rattle off pop culture memes and references as rapidly as possible. I have tried to let this show grow on me but the characters are too inhuman. I wouldn't wish to know any people remotely like this. If you live in the real world all day long, have actual principles and values, and do genuine productive things and your idea of chilling out is to watch a bunch of nihilistic, parasitic, clueless, post modern knuckleheads grope their way through life than you should absolutely buy this."
1,In the minority - I did not like this Series.,I have tried several times to watch this series and don't like it. I don't like the storylines or most of the characters. I will try again because all of the people that gave this a positive rating must be seeing something in it that I don't. I have quite an eclectic taste in DVD's and it is seldom that I don't find something in a show that I like but I couldn't with this one. Sorry but I would not purchase it.
4,Community is Funny as H-E- double hockey sticks!!,"I'll admit, it took me awhile to catch on to this show but,now that I've started watching it is one of my favorites. The characters are smart and well written and in spite of their over the top schenaigens the plots are still somehow believable. Gonna buy the HD Blu ray sets. I just hope they can continue for enough seasons to make it to syndication."
5,My One True Love,"I don't think I've loved a show this much before. I never get tired of rewatching Community; I've seen every episode at least 5-6 times. Abed is a gem & unceasingly hilarious. I showed 'Modern Warfare' to all my friends (reviews of ""badass"" across the board) and 'Debate 101' is probably my favorite. Only one or two episodes out of the entire season seemed a bit 'flat' and not especially funny to me.I highly recommend buying the DVD!"
3,disappointing!,thought with chevy chase that this would be hilarious and i really tried to like it but it fell flat.
5,Worth every penny,"I never buy anything on dvd anymore, but not only did I purchase this to support one of the smartest funniest comedies ever made, but this dvd is so full of bonus features that this dvd is actually worth the sticker price. With commentaries by the executive producer and stars of the show for every single episodes."
5,Abed is a shaman.,"Did you attend a city college? If you did, you know there are bits and pieces in this series that come straight off the campus! I haven't regularly watched a sitcom since Seinfeld left the tube--but I can't miss this one. This series will try almost anything and yet maintain the emotional core of each character. It's hilarious. Abed will grow on you. The wisdom he finds in television is awesome! And wisely insane, of course. Try it!"
5,Hilarity 311,"The episodes from the first season of Community have the rewatchability of Arrested Development or 30 Rock. The series is quirky, fun and more than a little bizzare but is all held together by a fantastic cast and immpeccable writing. Each show has a cast and crew commentary, which I love, and some of those commentaries are quite hilarious. A definite pickup for any fan of the show."
4,Fun TV adventure,"As a fan of Barbara Eden over the years I did enjoy her TV movie adventure. Some of the mystery plot is a bit dated and transparent. It is not Sherlock Holmes, and definitely not a CSI but still worthy of a nice bowl of popcorn with the family. If you enjoy the TV mystery of this period you will enjoy this one. Barbara does a fine job."
5,Toy Soldiers,very good movie full of action.. 1 of the best Movies iv seen Will Wheaton in and Sean Astin. Movie came out just before I finish H.S.. so I buy this movie.. very good action movie.
3,ok.,"With the third wheel Salty stays on track a bit better. However, it is too hard for my nephew to turn on and off, and since the wheels do not spin freely when pushed by hand he was quite disappointed and refused to play with it for a couple days."
5,Fun,Battery powered Salty made my grandson very happy. If only it had solar power instead of batteries. Ha. Ha. Ha.
3,Relatively inexpensive but makes annoying noise,"This little guy eats batteries like crazy and makes an annoying noise. Motors with high noises means there is too much friction going on in the gear box which is a sign of inefficiency. This explains short battery life. I would recommend it to give as a gift but not to own. Reason I say this, If you give it as a gift, you get it at a good price; however, if you plan on having it, you got to deal with the noise and cost of constantly replacing the battery."
2,Off track,"I'd ordered this for my 2 y.o train nut of a grandson to run on the Brio and Melissa & Doug wooden tracks I own, but something about the consruction of Salty the engine is off just enough that it gets stuck every few inches. It's been a disappointment. I'd return it, but the plastic packaging was so impervious I had to cut it open to get the train out so can't. A waste of money in my book. If you want a battery-operated toy train to run on your wooden train tracks, I'd try something else."
2,Salty died and won't move after a few months,"Our Salty died after a few month, just wouldn't move even with a fresh battery. Is there a repair center for that? Seems like there are a lot them with the same problem. My son loved it while it was working."
2,Doesn't work,"I had read the other reviews stating some didn't work, the battery wasn't long enough to meet the prongs but hoped they were dud products. Nope, after my 2 year old was beyond excited to get the train, we put a battery in and... nothing. We tried another battery brand, as suggested in the reviews I had read.. and still nothing. My husband finagled a metal piece to extend the battery to make a connection, and for a brief time, Salty worked! And he was soooo fast! But, we had to package him back up and send him back after the piece disconnected. Why continue to sell a product that is non-functional? Returns are so well done and easy thru Amazon might I add!"
1,Choose your company wisely,"This may or may not be a good product, I can't say. I ordered from MY TOYBOX and the product that they sent me doesn't work AT ALL. I contacted them and they didn't do nothing to remedy the situation (credit, refund, exchange, etc). So if you buy this product DON'T buy from My TOXBOX."
1,Not Happy with toy,"We purchased this trian for a Christmas present. Once opened on Christmas morning we found out it did not work, my son was very disappointed. When we called the company they said that they have not made this train in about a year- due to problems. The company was great to work with and offered a different item if we return the Salty. Amazon on the other hand was not so easy to work with- the customer service was terrible and they could only offer a refund."
1,Avoid! They do not stay on the track,I would not purchase the battery operated Thomas engines. We bought two of them and they will not stay on the tracks. Something about the wheels on the engines no being made correctly so both engines (One Thomas and one Percy) keep going off the track. Not a very good product.
2,Should've read reviews,"We have the battery operated Percy and LOVE it so I didn't even bother to read the reviews. Unfortunately the bottom of the train isn't staying tight to the top and causes it to come loose and it stops working. Obviously I'm not the only one who has been receiving a defective product. If you are looking for a great battery operated train, Percy is awesome and has been running strong for 6 months (and can withstand a lot of abuse)"
1,Save your money. Buy the non-powered version,"This was a Christmas present for my 2 year old boy. It has a strong motor will push and pull well, go up hills etc. However the middle set of wheels tends to bind in short curves and switches and this derails the engine (or it gets stuck). It can run unaided only on the simplest of tracks. My 3-4 year old couldn't keep his hands off it though. The motor lasted less than 3 months. Not for the child that likes to take things apart as well. I chose to return it when my son started picking the rubber grips off the wheels. I had high hopes for this product but it wasn't a good fit for my son. Better for a gentler, less inquisitive child. So consider your kids temperment and maybe save your money and buy the non-powered version."
4,Great product,The kids loved playing with this one. It can push a whole line of train cars or pull them. Had a bit of trouble up the hill but ok on it's own. Would recommend this for train lovers.
3,Problem with Sound Quality,"I am a HUGE Jon B. fan, have all his albums and waiting for him to drop the next one. This album just didn't have the same intensity for me as everything else he's done. After a few listens it grew on me, which never happens with a Jon B. album. Usually I can't get past the first track for repeating it so much before I let the next ones play. What really made it less enjoyable was the sound quality on some of the tracks. Some songs just felt unfinished and unpolished. Still love me some Jon B. forever though!"
3,Good characters,"This book was well written, I liked the Lucy character, and I think it was a good portrayal of a young girl in those circumstances. Most of the other reviewers have summed up the plot well, so I won't do that, but I DO want to say that I was really offended by the racial slur used to describe the character Ron (well, describing his accent) towards the end of the book. I re-read the paragraph over and over to see if it really said that. I can only guess Mr. Fromm, the author was trying to convey Lucy's disgust for this character. This could have been done without that expression. Shame on Mr. Fromm and his editors for letting a racist expression, which added nothing to the story, into the book!"
1,Terrible quality,"The sound quality of this CD is absolutely terrible - all of the tracks have a ""muddy"" feel to them as though the dynamic range has been completely destroyed.It's a common problem these days - music executives keep blindly ""increasing the volume"" on discs without any regard to the dynamic range. In effect, the ""loud"" and ""quiet"" parts of the song get compressed together into a nasty mess. Another sad victim of the ""Loudness war"" (look it up).Not recommended unless you want to quickly get a bad headache. Look up the original recordings or find a compilation with better quality standards instead."
4,An enjoyable book,"Although I much preferred the first book of this series ""Come the Night"". This book was quite good too. In fact I found myself enjoying it at times. What annoyed me about it though was that I found it confusing at times - due to double identities etc and i was not sure who was who (whether it was Devlyn or his double) and the love story in this book was not up to Ms Skye's usual standard I think. The fact also that the two main characters were married even before the beginning of book also decreased my enjoyment of it considerably. And I'm still not sure whether Devlyn had really lost his memory or not.But all in all this is definetly a worthwile book to read and also quite enjoyable."
3,Happy but not perfect,"I am very happy to get this book, even though it was kind of dusty and no jacket covering on it, but all in all please to have it."
1,Mass Dreams of the Future,"I read this book and viewed it as a work of fiction. To view it any other way is a crock. According to the book, we are now living in a survivalist wet-dream of a post-apocalyptic ice-age world in a state of total anarchy and social breakdown. Look around you. Didn't happen. The ""dreams"" are nothing more than the subconscious of the ""dreamers"" indulging in fantasy role-playing, with touches of Jack London's ""The Scarlet Plague"" and George R. Stewart's ""Earth Abides.""Don't just give this book a pass--go long and give it a forward pass into the nearest trashbin.In 3000 AD it will still be in a landfill. It's so bad bacteria won't touch it."
4,"Wonderful imagery, but..............................","This is a great book if you can ignore the text. The quality of the pictures is superb and there are plenty of close ups which is invaluable for someone interested in Ingres' technique from an artistic point of view. However this book is more of a social commentary on Ingres and the times in which he lived then a straight collection on his works, and it's pretty uncomplimentry about most of the things it covers.The quality of the reproductions and the helpful close-ups are invaluable for an artist interested in portraiture or Ingres' style, but the actual book seems to be written from the ""I know everything about this subject and if I make it look stupid then I make myself look knowledgeable and clever"" school of art critics/historians.0 stars for the author but a definate 5 stars for the artwork. Highly recommended for the serious artist or art lover. I'm really glad I bought it."
5,Absolutely astounding!,I absolutely had a heart attack when i found this book its so beautiful this is one of my most cherished books its so hard to find these sort of books these days too!
2,Never Trusted the Readings,"This was my 3rd or 4th attempt at getting a reliable ear thermometer. With this particular one the readings were always different, even within a matter of seconds, and depending on which ear was used. A difference of a few tenths of a point would be normal but differences of a point or more is not acceptable. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the ease of use of ear thermometers in general, but in hindsight, this one is not even a tradeoff for ease since I had to buy yet a different brand, which, by the way, I am extremely pleased with. Check out my other reviews to find it.One other comment, this model of Lumiscope is a 2215, and there is one that seems to be exactly the same model for a very different price. I don't have time to check it out but you might want to read the info on both before buying one."
4,Good ol' arcade fun.,"The good: The graphics hold up pretty well. Nothing in the game looks overly-pixelated and the meshes are well-designed. They built a fairly expansive city, and you get both the arcade and Dreamcast version, so good on Sega. You can play in Arcade, Timed, or Special (i.e. you perform various feats on speciality tracks, such as landing a long jump) modes, and they're all fun. The gameplay style is basic (arrow keys), but it's perfect for this type of game where you'll be playing in short bursts. Really easy to pick up -- fun at parties. The general premise of taking people to their destinations as fast as you can really gives the game a hectic attitude. Oh, and the music fits perfectly.The bad: The game doesn't support graphics modes above 1280x720 or AA. That's unfortunate.The ugly: The characters, while well designed, haven't aged well in the graphics department. Really. It's a good thing you mostly see their backs.Verdict: A nice arcade/console conversion. Worth the price."
2,AT&T 954,I bought 3 of these for my home solely for the intercom feature. I have tried everything and I cannot get the intercom to work. I am very unhappy.
1,No Replacement parts,"AT&T / Advanced American Telephone does not sell replacement parts like the handsetDear Jim,Thank you for your recent inquiry to our Customer Service Help Desk.Unfortunately, Advanced American Telephones does not sell the handsetsor the bases as separate parts of our products.We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.Sincerely,MarlonNational Service CenterAdvanced American Telephones"
1,"Good Phone, Bad Receiver","In our office we use four of these phones. We have only been in business less than a year and have already returned two phones. The only reason was buzzing in the earpiece. We have determined it is from where the phone plugs into the reciever. I had hoped it was just one bad phone, but after already returning two I have two more that are buzzing when you answer them and during conversations. If you pull or push on the cord you can sometimes get it to clear up. In a business it just doesn't sound very professional when you have to make excuses for your messed up phones. I'm now looking for a new system."
2,Intercom problem,"Bought 4 phones 2 years ago but now one phone's intercom rings automatically and when that phone is unplugged, other phone intercoms dont work. Also other phones can now ""listen in"" on conversations. Not a quality phone for a business."
1,Want your business to sound like it cares about quality?,"Then don't buy this phone! We bought five, and every last one is a piece of junk. Callers began telling us we sounded like we were talking through a pillow or from the bottom of a garbage can. We have surely lost customers as a result."
3,Could have been a magazine article,"I read this book in two days, it's that easy to read. Some of it was quite interesting but it doesn't hold up well as a whole. There are fascinating tidbits scattered throughout and the account of Grant's final year renders him a sympathetic character. I think it's a stretch to argue that the book's main thesis is supported by the book's contents. It's hard to buy into the argument that either man was aware of the importance of the issue of race to the degree to which the author believes. At any rate, it was an interesting book but could have been made into a long magazine article instead."
1,Poorly written and unbalanced,"I'm a great admirer of Mark Twain but I didn't find much of him in this book at all. The book is basically about US Grant and his book, but I was more interested in reading about Twain. The mistakes the author puts in about Twain are almost laughable, anyone just starting out with the subject might make them but for a published author to make them is quite embarrassing. The portions about Grant were slightly better, but I expect much more from a book purporting to be about history and two great figures, an historical and a literary one. Very disappointing, frustrating reading."
2,Not enough Twain,"Though I'm interested in Grant, I really came to this book expecting half of it to be about Mark Twain. After all, his name share the title. So I thought, mistakenly, it would be about both men. That was mistake number one because the book is mostly about Grantm which is okay, but then it should have been titled, ""General Grant."" The second problem is that there was nothing about Twain after Grant died of cancer. The book just stops cold turkey. I was looking forward to at least reading a synopsis of Twain's life after Grant dies. This was a disappointing book for me."
5,Three cheers for Mrs. Murphy,I bought this book for my mother--Mrs. Murphy--just for the novelty and because she reads so ravenously it's hard to keep her supplied with good books. Now we've both read and enjoyed it. It is engaging and entertaining and moves along at a good pace. And it has a cat. What more could you want in a book?
4,Fun te read,This one is situated more at the beginning of the Mrs Murpy mysteries timeline. As usual the novel is quick-paced.
4,Great fun! A cat/animal lovers dream. Funny and fast paced!,"Sneaky Pie Brown has a wit and charm not often found in feline literature now days. ""Mrs. Murphy"", Pewter & Tee Tucker, are the cat's meow in this fast paced, thourghly delightful romp. Clever dialog, colorful characters and an intriguing plot, culminate in a ""can't put it down"" experience. Though I figured out who done it early on, Sneaky Pie kept my interest and made me doubt my resolve many times. Not a boring minute in the wole lot.Keep it up Sneaky Pie, don't let your Mom discourage your efforts! Ive already started your next masterpiece ""Rest in Pieces"", and have all the others with the exception of the new hardbound. Come to the ""Book Carnival"" in Orange, California and sign one for me, OK?"
4,"Not challenging, but certainly fun","I am not much of a mystery fan, but I am a cat lover, and I found this book tremendously fun to read, more for the cat and dog characters than the humans. Mrs. Murphy has such personality, and watching her interactions with Tucker (the dog) and the other animals of the town is quite amusing."
4,Cute...,"This book, though i would never never never call it quality literature, is cute and entertaining. I read it in 5 days and it kept my mind occupied and filled some time.She portrays a small Southern town and its human and pet residents. She really makes the reader feel as though they are part of the action and each of the characters come alive through her brilliant language.Don't expect an intellectual read (the ending isn't much of a surprise)... but it is most definately fun.It is definately no ""Rubyfruit Jungle"" or ""In Her Day"", but i enjoyed in nonetheless..."
3,A cat and dog as sleuths?,"I am a great fan of Lilian Jackson Braun's Cat Who series, and I wanted to read this one because I've read all the KoKo series to date. This book is nothing like the Braun series. I found the ""so-called"" dialogue amongst the animals in the series kind of off-putting, and not believable. Although the human characters seem to hold some promise since they appear to be quirky and unique. That will allow me to read another book in this series just to see how it goes. Mrs. Murphy and Tucker are rather cute if the author didn't try to have their human communication included in the book. We'll see"
4,Good book but a little slow,"I really liked the main characters for this book, Mrs. Murphy (the cat) and the dog, her best friend. The book was so cute, loved it, it was a very enjoyable read. The murders were gruesome, but not in a scary way. I have the first three books in the series and I definitely am looking forward to reading them!"
3,More Whimsey Than Mystery,"If you're actually looking for a murder mystery, better skip Rita Mae Brown's ""Mrs. Murphy"" series; although entertainingly written, it relies more upon charm than upon detection. Still, Brown carries these books off with a light touch and considerable good humor, and WISH YOU WERE HERE, the first in the series, is actually among her better efforts in the series.The novel introduces us to Mary ""Harry"" Haristeen, postmistress of a small Virgina town--and to her cat, Mrs. Murphy, and dog, Tee Tucker. When their beloved ""mother"" decides to help local authorities in their effort to solve a string of grotesque murders, Mrs. Murphy and Tee Tucker decide to help out. Brown's animal characters are able to talk to each other in this series, and their comments are often entertaining. If you can accept the premise, and if you're not too picky about the details of the plot, you'll enjoy Brown's characters, tone of voice, and imagination."
3,Cute story but...,"I liked the story very much; however, I didn't like the language used in the book. I would not recommend this book. There's no reason the author has to have her characters use such language. Literature (even cozy novels) should set a good example, not stoop to gutter language. I'll stick to reading ""The Cat Who..."" novels."
4,"Cute,But Hard","I have a friend who let me play this game the first baby I had to babysit was Ella Then her brother I forgot his name. It's kinda hard to feed them because they cry so much and get grumpy and it is REALLY hard to rock them, but entertaining them isn't. I don't know how to go to the store and it seems that every 5 minutes someone comes knocking on the door. and the people kinda look sort of strange. and the bird is really weird.After 15 minutes after playing the game I just pulled it out of the slot and put in nintendogs It's really cute ,But really hard."
1,What the hell?!,No where did it say that this was a USED game but that's what I got! A USED game! Oh my goodness! Wth?!
1,Game was very boring,I bought this game for my 9 year old daughter and she played it for only an hour or so before she got bored. Normally she sticks to a game for a long time. Her complaint was that the game is very boring and there is very little to actually do.
2,Wish I Could Play It,"My little sister got this for Christmas last year and I'll admit it is pretty fun. The babies are adorable. However, feeding the baby can be hard at times as the game doesn't read the stylus movements very well. I don't even mess with playing the instruments; they're so hard to work. Overall, you can wash dishes, feed the baby, rock the baby, dress them up, mow the lawn, vacumm the attic, change diapers, and order things ""online"". I should warn you though. I wish I could play the game, but I guess it is broken. We have one child that will NOT go home. We left the game on for 8 hours straight! Plus, she was the fussiest baby, Ella. Apparently her parents didn't want her. Also, the things we ordered ""online"" stopped coming. Wow, nice game! People really go for the games that don't change for 8 hours! Buy at your own risk."
1,very hard game,My 5 yr grand daughter played this game with the help of older girls and wanted the game but since Christmas has played very little. Very realistic and hard for young children.
1,Not impressed with Imagine: Babyz!,Hi I'm autistic adult gamer...Personally I think they could of done better with the game and graphic's on Imagine: Babyz. This game is not worth the 30 dollars I paid for it new unfortunately I could not find this game used heaven's know I which it was used. It's frustrating but eventually you figure it out. This game is not really worth it though if anything it's creepy I mean a babysitter who just stay's in the house all day with a stork on the chimney yeah a just a little creepy.Save your self the money and just get Imagine: Babysitter's the graphic's and gameplay are way more better than this one.
2,Visible effort by the author that interests few,"The author is very talented, especially in the live performances of her works, but the books come off as enjoyable only for those interested in her topics of the innercity and politics."
1,Multiethnic malarkey,"Foul. With this ""play"", the author tries to sound unbiased, with her africa pendant, african clothes, yes, ok, I dont buy it. Her turning tragedy into art trivializes death, conflict and illuminates her own lack of talent."
1,Sponges,"And these aren't the Not Mom's Scrubby sponges I've purchased in the past. I used to get them at Lowe's and they were thick, soft, curvy and very nice to use. When I could no longer find them at Lowe's I was thrilled to find them online BUT these are cheap, thin, inflexible sponges...guess I'll use them to clean out the birdbath."
2,disappointing,I am disappointed with this tin of marbles. The description says the marbles are of different sizes but what I got is a bunch of tiny marbles of the same size.
4,"A lot of money for marbles, tin to hold them is a great idea.","It's a lot of money for a tin of marbles, but there are some cool marbles included. I would have hoped for more cool marbles given the price. The tin is a great idea and very functional. Much less likely to lose one's marbles this way."
2,childish,"The childish antics and two dimentional over excitement of the presenters, made this show unwatchable for me. It is an interesting premise and might me more appropriate for a younger audience."
1,One terrible book.,"Hello, you can refer to me as bob. I am here to make public my opinion of the book: God Emperor of Dune. I think that this book is horrible. It makes no sense and is very, very, boring. This book has poor continuity and is nearly impossible to follow. To those of you who have not read this: DON'T! This book is too long for it's level of entertainment. This book is hardly worth reading, in fact it's not at all worth reading. I strongly suggest: do not read this boring, stupid, unrealistic, nerdy book. Thank You."
4,Damn good book. very DEEP.,"I love the entire series. But i have to say this is the worst one. All the rest are 8's 9's and 10's... so as u can see.. this book is the worst in the series but still has a pretty high rating over all.This installment was much slower and more philosophical than the rest. Much of the time is spent watching the conversations beteen LetoII and the latest incarnation of Duncan Idaho. While their discussions are very stimulating, they are no were as entertaining as Paul leading his fremen in to battle (book1) or following the adventures of Miles, the most formitable General of his day. (books 5 and 6)I was also saddened by the fact Dune becomes a lush and green planet. But.. the story must go on."
5,The best and most moving of the series,"Herbert's God Emperor, Leto II, is a fascinating character, with recognizable elements from historical figures and philosophers. This aspect of Leto's personality arises from his taste in selecting and internalizing his ancestral memories. The plot is fairly streamlined compared to the other Dune books: the God Emperor has used his power to convert the ""known universe"" into a kind of psychological pressure cooker for the human spirit. The novel looks into this world at the point when it is about to blow it's top."
1,Disappointing.,"Having loved ""Dune,"" having enjoyed ""Dune Messiah,"" and having found ""Children of Dune"" interesting, I could barely finish this installment of the saga. Boredom permeates the book, covering the plot (and reader) with a patina of pointlessness."
2,The weakest link,"This book is mostly dialogue with very little action. There is an exciting beginning, then things slow down and don't pick back up again until the very end. While many fans rave about this book, I just couldn't take the idea of Leto as a hybrid human-sandworm seriously enough to enjoy the book. If you're able to do this, I'm sure it's a much better read."
2,A test in patience,"I enjoyed the first three books, but this one disappointed me. I stuck with it hoping for it to get better, but it just didn't. While I agree Frank Herbert is a creative genius which can still be seen in this book, this book was just dull all the way through. It's full of repetitive dialog and the climax was pretty obvious early on. If you want to continue with the series, though, I'd recommend drudging through this one or you'll be somewhat lost in Heretics, which I'm currently reading and is already much more interesting. Who knows? Maybe you'll enjoy what I didn't."
5,Best Of All DUNE Books.,"God Emperor of DUNE is by far the best of all the DUNE books. The Plot, the character development and the sheer scope of Herbert's imagination. I found myself hating Leto all through the book until the end when he finally explains everything. At that point I understood why he did the things he did. All other DUNE books fails to compare."
4,A new beginning for the Dune series,"God Emperor of Dune, the fourth book of the Dune series, begins a new saga in the Dune chronicles. Set over 3000 years later, the son of Muad'dib, Leto II, has undergone a horrible transformation, and now rules with an iron hand. Although his rule is for the benefit of mankind, he is feared and hated. This is the most philosophical of the Dune books, and sets the pace for the second trilogy of Dune. Although an excellent, occasionally God Emperor gets too involved in the inner workings of Leto's mind, which slows the pace a bit. However, this is a must read for anyone who love Herbert's Dune books"
1,Pointless,"I truly loved the first 3 books, but this one is highly disappointing. The book lacks any story line, it is basically a bunch of common sense facts and truths delivered as though it is some kind of higher knowledge. If you are into philosophy and that kind of thing you'll probably be able to finish it, as for me I couldn't but put it off."
1,Should be called Galling Endlessness of Dull,"I'm no stranger to long and difficult novels (war and peace, gulag archipeligo) but GEOD is a very dull book.I've made it 55% through on my kindle and can go no further. In fact i downgraded my earlier review now to 1 star. Terrible book.It's very philosophical and well thought out as a concept, but at the same time as others have indicated here, pretty much nothing happens. Epic Dull. I'm sorry to have wasted any time now on this stinkerI really wanted to like it. Loved the predecessors and the House books by Brian, but this one pretty much helped solve my insomnia!!"
3,ehh....,"This novel reads like a monologue of Herbert's personal philosophy. Well, at least it's good philosophy. The character development could've been better... only Leto's personality was really explored. The only other interesting character had her bratty points and disappeared in subsequent books. And as for the Fish Speakers? Chant this to Leto instead of Sianoq: ""Nihil curo de ista tua stulta superstitione."" ""I don't need your dopey religious cult."" They aren't clearly developed nor truly relevant. But... as I am a sucker for good mythology, this book did keep it alive and is a neccessary read to complete the series."
4,Heady Stuff,"This book is not perticularly an easy read, it is very rich with philosophy, political intrigue and such.It is a little hard to follow at times, but nevertheless it is a must read, especially if you are going to continue the Dune saga.Even if this sort of book isn't your preference, Frank Herbert had a vision and will leave you confuzed if you skip this novel and read the following ones."
5,This is a fine piece of literature,"Everyone should have a chance to read the dune books. Sci-fi fan or not it coalesce's religion,ecology,politics,philosophy and even moral guidelines into one long stretch of epic fiction. Anyone with a chance to read this or any of the other books should well do so."
2,Not what I expected from a Dune Sequel.,"I read ""Dune"", and loved it! It was great. So, I bought the second part, and it was good, so I went ahead and bought the next 4 chapters...Book 3 was interesting, although not as good as book 2, IMHO. I just did not like ""God Emperor of Dune"". It was too pretentious, for my taste. I did not like the transformation of Lord Leto II. And I'm sick of the gholas.I had heard that the best books were 1, 2, 5 and 6. I hope that is so, since so far that comment has been right. And I already have the last two books, anyway. This book was not so disappointing as to make me quit the series, but I expected more from it, or something different, at least."
2,day2trip,"I have read Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune. God Emperor of Dune was a big disappointment. The whole story centers around this half man/half worm Leto II, and frankly it was just plain ridiculas. I don't recommend reading GEoD if you want to keep a good thought about the chronicles in general."
4,Are you entertained by pure philosophy?,"I am, which made this book easy for me to finish. But the story had little depth and the character of Leto was too removed from humanity to really empathize with. One is not left feeling that one has witnessed, first-hand, a great adventure of mind and body, as one is in Dune."
1,I don't think so,"Two words, just didn't like it. After reading the first three i noticed Herbert's quality stedilly declining. The first was just overwhelming. The second ok but shadowed by the first. Third like the second but the fourth, God Emperor of Dune. Just Horrible."
4,Super Reader,"God Emperor of Dune is set several thousand years after the events in Children of Dune. Leto's sandtrout metamorphosis has continued, and he is becoming more of a sandworm.He continually keeps Duncan Idaho gholas by his side as this gift keeps being sent to him.He is now seen by most as a tyrant, but is still working towards his plan. He has plans for his latest Duncan Idaho, and a woman named Siona, and is protected by a female military service.Duncan and Siona plot against Leto on their own, and realising his sandworm nature, know that water is antithetical to him. When they strike, Leto's body breaks down and baby sandtrout escape into the desert. Leto, dying, tells them about his spice hoard."
2,"Not a bad story, but so wordy.","A somewhat interesting story is bogged down by wordy and pretentious dialogue. Much of the book is set in Leto's private chambers where he attempts to talk the reader to death. The story itself manages to hold ones attention amazingly long, but after a while all the psuedo-psychological babbling becomes a bore. The original book rose above its pop pschology rantings; this one simply wallows in its."
3,dune:land of philosophy,"After reading the first three books of dune,i ve understand that there is no chance to get the magic of first 2 books.franr herbert killed muad dib too early i guess and change the racial features of house atreides.this book is all about philosophy and action is out."
4,Book four in the Dune series,"Frank Herbert returns after his first three books to take up events thousands of years after Pauls son, Leto II, becomes emperor. Leto transformation into an immortal sand worm is almost complete. The golden path is almost to the end, but does Leto have the stomach to keep on living? Is the price of immortality is boredom? Duncan returns again and again in this novel where Atreides must hurt the one they love and man kind must lose its faith in false gods forever if the golden path must be reache"
4,The Atreides clan at it again,"Well, this was worth picking up. It's a much different story from the previous 3 efforts, but I still loved it. Even a god can succumb to the power of the P, or is it the P? Another intriguing and thought-provoking adventure from the brilliant Frank Herbert. You won't believe how twisted Leto has become. If you loved Dune, this is awesome, although it takes place roughly 3500 years after the end of COD."
5,God Emperor of Dune,I have read all f the original Dune novels and all of the new Dune novels and I have to say my top 2 are Dune then God Emperor of Dune.
5,DUNE IV,Frank Herbert can really spin a tale. I lost my copy of this years ago and was glad to be able to complete my set again.
2,"Too Many Words, Not Enough Content","This novel was extremely disappointing. Leto II is one of the most tiresome characters I have ever seen. While talking to his close friends like Moneo and Duncan, he rambles on and on without actually saying anything. What a normal person can accomplish in a mere sentence takes Leto an entire paragraph. Midway through the book, I lost all incentive for finishing it.Most of the other characters in the book aren't much better. Hwi Noree continually breaks into tears whenever Leto talks about his ""awesome sacrifice"", and Moneo always seems to be encouraging Leto in his never-ending speeches by asking dumb questions like ""How, Lord?"". The only characters I can actually stand are Duncan Idaho and Siona. They are the only ones with enough common sense not to blindly follow Leto in his ""Golden Path"".Reading this book is a waste of time. I would recommend skipping this book entirely and going on to the next."
3,Glad there was a Dune 5!,"It was just a very strange book. Hard to explain. It made me depressed and very anxious to get to Books 5 and 6. Maybe that was exactly what it was meant to do.And now, I find Dune 5 to be a very rich new beginning, almost as good as the First Dune.All in all, a worthy bridge to Books 5 and 6."
2,"Exellent series, execpt for this book...","God Emperor of Dune is an essential part of the Dune series, and therefore you must have read it. It contains certain key events, described from the God emperors point-of-view, which is the only way to know how stuff really happened. In the sequels, which happen several mellenia later, the people have a quite wrong image of the God Emperor, because history is written by the victors.. This book is unfortunately the most awful book I've'ever read, and trust me, I've read plenty. The storyline is downright pessimistic, none of the main characters, excluding the Idaho invoke any sympathy, while The Fremen have continued to degenerate. Hell, Duncan even meets one with BROWN EYES! Fortunately, the sequels to this book make up for this debacle. Read it, yawn, cry a little and move on to the next book, which I rate 5 stars."
4,God Emperor of Dune,"A very climactic book, which again is a Frank Herbert political book disguising itself as a work of science fiction."
3,A book in transition,"Overall this is another solid link in the Dune series and was, admittedly by Herbert, a step in a different narrative direction. Like the other books it has an ample discussion of politics, religion and philosophy woven in and around the concept of free will. However, God Emperor of Dune is a departure from the characters and even the setting that is so familiar in the initial three books.If you are hesitant about continuing on the Golden Path, now might be a good time to jump off. If you are as committed to it as Leto II, then by all means continue."
2,Hmm...is this really necessary?,"A pretty book in the Chic tradition--the ultimate bathroom book, a great gift for a housewarming or bridal shower, more eye candy to display, but as far as usefulnes...? Who doesn't know the difference between soap and bath gel? Or what to stock up on or bring when traveling...kind of common sense don't ya think?And minus the photos it would be one boring book. Pretty pointless.If you are a sucker for cool pictures like I am, and love the glossy style the Chic series is noted for, then this is a great addition to your growing library. If not? Pass on it!"
3,Not Worth The Price,"This a very powerful program that lets you make professional slide shows. If you just want it for home use, it is not worth the price. There are some annoying things in the program, for instance when you zoom out it does it at an unsteady speed."
1,Listing review,"Listing does not tell you how many hooks are being sold for the price. Apparently it is for one container, but it doesn't say how many are in the container. This is a comment on the listing, not on the product or its quality."
5,Another Smash Hit!!!,"As an avid fan of ""Sex and the City,"" I'm constantly looking for stories that fill my need for smart, sassy, empowered, and real women. Ms. Alan is a top writer for her genre, and does an amazing job of creating characters that women can relate to and a story that you can't help but getting pulled into. If you love and miss ""Sex and the City"", then I recommend that you read all of Ms. Alan's other literary treasures which include, ""Who You Know"" and ""Spur of the Moment.""I hope Santa will bring me the entire Theresa Alan collection!!!"
4,good material,"Very nice, good material, colors are a little dull, but it gives it a whimsicle appearance, I'm very happy with it"
2,Pure unadulterated drivel,"Smarmy, purple prose flows and flows and flows. Though also sickeningly sweet, Gillian is totally strange and unbelievable as a character. Actually, she reminds me of the peopel I used to read about in my moms 1950's pre-harlequin novels. Only this time, the heroine wants a heroine, not a hero. Seems like the author is trying hard, but this totally does not work. Made me cringe and I couldn't finish the last third."
4,Bargin Priced.,I have purchased several other Arkon items and I have been pleased. This cup holder mounting kit works as promised but it is a little flimsey. The quality is what you expect for the price so I wasn't dissapointed. I have used this every day for the last 3 months and it still holds my Cingular 8125 securely.
4,Good holder,"I bought this to use in my Honda CR-V in the pullout cup holder to hold my Nokia 5800 cell phone. It works very well for me. The holder has adjustable sides to make it fit any cup holder and the phone holder part is also adjustable so your phone is held snugly in place until you press the release. One thing I don't like about it is that if you don't adjust the holder to make the phone face you before fixing it in place you have to readjust the whole thing again, another dislike is that you can't adjust the height (it's fixed). Other than that I would recommend it."
2,Kinda Crap,"I have used this product for a few weeks now and it already is starting to creep out of the cup holder and fall out periodically. The principle it is using to stay in the cup holder is sound, the problem is that they are using cheap plastic screw shafts with a plastic thumb wheel where they should just use metal parts.Still that said, it is the best thing I have found so far. It is better than the method that screws into the cigarette lighter by the same company. That worked for awhile but the torque on the lighter housing eventually broke it loose and left it spinning in the dash. This meant the stand would flip when every I hit a curve.There needs to be better products out there for this.Brian"
5,Digital pictures look great on this paper!,"What fun are your digital pictures if you can't print some of them and take them along?Thats exactly what I do sometimes and this paper gives me exactly what I need. This glossy paper gives my printed pictures quality as sharp as my computer displays them. Combined with a quality printer ( i use an HP 842C ), colors come out vivid and the clarity is very nice.Sure its expensive, but if you want to print your digital pictures then this is the paper for you. Hope this helps."
5,My favorite salt.,Man I love this salt. I swear even compared to other premium sea salts there's something special about this stuff. I have been using it exclusively for a year or so now and have even given it as a gift along with good peppercorns and olive oil and my friends that aren't foodies were really surprised at what a difference good salt makes.Not that this matters but I see this salt being used on Iron Chef America frequently.
5,"A tasty, affordable sea salt","What a bargain. I usually buy pricier salts, but after using this one, that may never happen again. I share boxes with my family, and they love."
5,So Good!,I bought Maldon Sea Salt after a friend mentioned how good it was. I can't believe the difference between it and other salts. The crunchy texture and the clean taste makes it perfect for everything from steak to a baked potato to desserts. It is and will be a permanent fixture on our table from now on.
3,Don't care for taste,"I heard Maldon was supposed to have a wonderful taste. After using it for a while, my husband and I don't care for the tast so much. As far as the use of it, I was under the impression it was to be used in cooking, but heard later it was for garnishing on a finished plate. When added to a pan to saute, it takes alot longer to melt than kosher salt. Some of the thicker flakes never melt completely, so we get a mouthful of large salt flakes with some bites of our meal (which I don't like). Used as a garnish, it looks cool but again, it's way to salty and thick for me to eat. The flavor is a very clean, super salty taste- more salty than the other sea and kosher salts we use. I know it is very popular so I am probably one of the few that doesn't care for it."
3,Puts The Sea in Sea Salt,"I really thought I would love this salt; I really tried to love this salt: I am just not a big fan of this salt. This salt puts the Sea in Sea Salt (more so than other sea salts) -and for me that equates to a C in flavor. I really get an 'ocean aftertaste' that I do not care for. Perhaps this salt would go well with sea food, but since I don't eat a lot of sea food it is not for me. Another disappointment for me is the loss of crunchiness when this salt touches anything moist; other salts seem to be able to hold onto their crunch a little better. I will raise this review if I find a food that embraces this salt's uniqueness to my liking."
5,Happy to find Maldon thru Amazon!,"Maldon Sea Salt is increasingly difficult to find in my community. Imagine my delight when I looked for it online and there it was thru Amazon! Thanks for making it so easy to restock my pantry, Amazon! If you haven't used this product, I cannot recommend it highly enough. I seldom use salt while cooking (except where it makes a real difference such as baking); instead I provide a small wooden bowl of Maldon at the dinner table as a finishing salt. Years ago a friend shared a conversation she and her husband had on their way home from dinner at our house: Husband asked why food at our home always tasted so good; wife replied ""well, it may begin with the salt and pepper ""gingergal"" uses! Enough said."
3,It's just salt,I didn't find this salt particularly different or exciting especially given the price. I'm using it but not sure I would order again.
5,Very good flavor,"I bought this because it was recommended in the Four Hour Chef-- had to buy a salt grinder to use it, but now like it just fine."
5,One of my favorite things,This is a great salt. I use it for a lot of things but it really stands out as a nice crunchy finishing salt and in a cup of cocoa
3,I beg to differ...,"I beg to differ with the other reviewer. There is no comprehensive treatment of the bamboo species here. This is a technical work on bamboo morphology, physiology and stuff like that. You won't find descriptions of ""the bamboos"" here. Sorry but couldn't let that stand."
2,poorly organized,"this has to be one of the most poorly organized books I've encountered. Very difficult to find information. For example, reading through the section on the coast, there are two pages on the Gorge. Frustrating. The information contained in minimal."
5,Well packaged book,"I like how this couple presents their information. The book is full of useful data. I have purchased this in preparation for our journey to Alaska, British Columbia, Yukon and Northwest Territories. It does a superb job of helping you understand what to look for, where to look for it, how much things cost relative to other areas. Excellent job."
3,"Not 1"" thick","Sigh. Incorrect amazon product information strikes again. The description says they're thin, and they ARE ""sponge cloths"", but the product information clearly says they're 8x6x1. So I'm a little disappointed that when I opened the (much smaller than expected) box and pulled out a package I found that they're about 2/10"" thick (and 8x7 as described). So, if you're looking for a large, 1"" thick sponge keep looking. These aren't what you need. . .I didn't open the packages themselves (hoping to return them), but they do look like nice sponge cloths."
5,Christmas Gift,My neighbor love this movie to the point that I had to seek out this movie just to get it as a gift.
5,"Oh, Lucy! Mouthing off to a Serial Killer, what are you thinking?",This movie is so adorable from the very first shot of Ari Graynor who I thought was Alicia Witt with the nose I always thought she should have. Lucy is hilarious - a giant strawberry with attitude and Colin Hanks is JUST like his father - sneaky but sweet looking in a Mormonesque way. This movie is so amusing.
3,Almost what I wanted,"Good quality product but didn't quite meet the use I had intended. It won't fit a iPod with a docking cable but it will cradle it. To the products credit, it didn't say it would fit. Otherwise the vent mounting system works but it would nicer if it could be a little more secure. The over design is robust and yet simple. I'm sure it would be a good solution for holding some other device such as a small cell phone or GPS"
2,too loose joint...,The rotational axis is too loose and can't be adjusted. The cell with the mount can fall easily with any small jerks. I had to fix this joint permanently to be able to use this. Now it works fine!
5,Very nice!,"Have had these for about 6 months now with no issues what so ever. Great lights, great build quality. These are much better than the comparatively priced Malibu lights."
4,Naughty's Review,"Although I realize that this song clearly has no ravishing lyrics....its still a jam. For those who are bitter because this song reminds them of hip hop hooray and OPP...I'd just like to say that those were the days that you could go to a party and genuinely have a good time. It was a relief to hear people singing about something everyone can relate to ...rather than things they don't have. Jamboree catches your attention and would make anyone with a shread of ""real"" party bob their heads...even if just a little bit."
1,TIRED SONG,"The CD aint all that good, ""Jamboree"" aint a good song, but sadly its the best one on the CD. Naughty yall need to quit son."
2,Not another weak summer jam!,Okay tell me if you don't get haunting memories of Hip Hop Horray when you here this song or see the video... And Zhane did not add muchPls NBN try something new this is too 1993!
5,you gotta luv this song,"this is the song yall. you havn't heard a real good song till you hear this one. Keep it up Naughty, and neva stop. Representin Naughty and i'm out yall"
5,A great song.,"A great song. In my opinion, should be featured on every future party/compilation produced."
5,BEST BODY EXFOLIATOR EVER!!!,"I have always used body scrubs, recently the Clinique one, but the Neutrogena sugar scrub is without doubt the best! It leaves your skin so soft, that you do not even need a body lotion. Use it on your hands too for immediate softness."
5,"Neutrogena Sugar Scrub Body Exfoliator, Energizing Citrus","I absolutely love this product! It has a very light citrus fragrance, isn't greasy and makes my hands silky smooth. I took it to work one day and told everyone we were having ""Spa Day"" and everyone loved it - even the men! I would strongly encourage anyone with rough, dry hands to try it."
2,TO MUCH OIL,"I wish they had put more sugar in it. It's mostly oil, it didn't exfoliate my skin at all ..."
1,Horrible feeling...,I purchased this sugar scrub because I wanted to use it in the shower for my arms and legs. It left my body feeling like I took a dip in a tub of oil. If you want to feel greasy and a sticky mess then I recommend this product.
2,Overly sweet scent and poor exfoliation,"After falling in love with Neutrogena's new skin rejuvenator, I looked forward to trying this scrub to replace my favorite body scrub by Kristal, which is fantastic and less per ounce than the Neutrogena but difficult to find. This product looked like it would be similar. Wrong. The Kristal scrub has a delicate, natural scent and is a soft gel that really foams up when you rub it on. The grains are small and well concentrated and dispersed throughout so you get great coverage and good exfoliation without irritation. The Neutrogena scrub has a cloyingly sweet scent and is really concentrated -- it goes on in a big glop and if you use it in the tub it leaves everything slimy, even after a good washing up. The grains are on the large side but not well concentrated, so they are really rough but don't cover your skin well. And at more per ounce than my favorite scrub, I'm going to pass on this product in the future."
5,great,"Love, love, love this product. Such a wonderful scent and great moisturizer. Sell is fast and great to do business with."
1,live and learn .....,not the cd that i was expecting so live and learn. serves me right for buying it without a picture available.
4,Nice Herbal Blend,"This is a very tasty, high quality blend. It is a little tart, and I prefer to mix it in with my other teas than unto itself.Great to mix with a white tea for an evening cup!"
5,A Great Book!,"When I bought this book, I knew close to nothing about OBE's, but since I've read it, I can actually have an intelligent discussion about them! This book is THE resource on astral projection and OBE's, and although I haven't had and OBE yet, I recommend that you purchase this book if you are even the least bit interested and want to know more."
5,Complete Informative How To Book,"Though I have not read the entire book, it is a complete informative book. The writer helps you to understand the dynamics as well, and does a good job at that. Very interesting and good food for the sub-conscience to feast on. OBE's are easiest when it is given food for travel.Janice"
4,Not for those who aren't serious!,"This book is extremely in-depth regarding astral travel, astral planes, and much more, including a section on lucid dreaming. It is a very large book and it is written in a style that is easy-to-read...however, due to the substantial amount of information it provides, I would only recommend it for those who are SERIOUS about astral travel and who are willing to put out the time and effort that is necessary!"
5,Awesome!,"The title says it all! If you're interested in Astral Projection, you can also visit http://www.astralpulse.com/, as the author many free guides there."
4,Information,"The focus of this book is what Robert Bruce calls the New Energy Way. It's a method of energy work by tactile methods. You start out feeling an area of your body as if someone is touching and moveing around that area with a feather. This causes energy to move. He says you need to unblock your energy paths for an OOBE.If you are a tactile person or your a person that is blind, this book will work for you. I'm not so it's not that great for me.The core of Robert Bruce's way is the same for all OOBE methods. These methods are relaxation, and an altered state of conciousness.The other information in the book that you can find by viewing the contents pages is very helpful in explaining things that you only get with experience. Experience and the dedication to OOBE's by the author is the key that sets this book apart from the rest.I give this book four stars because the tactile method isn't for me, but the information is great."
4,Interesting,This was a thought provoking book. I found that the excercises he recommended really enabled me to feel energy moving within me. I should try keeping it up!
4,Bruce's first...,"From a reknowned astral expeditioner you might expect quite a book. The contents are mostly brief overviews of all sorts of projection topics. Also exercises. This book won't get you to astral project, only trying will do that. There's a few starts at theories, but as Robert's maiden book I hope he keeps at it so we can hit the meat someday. He just tries to cover all sorts of things here and it amounts to pretty summary information, which is not what you want to hear from an expert for. I'd much rather read a book of his adventures."
3,"This is a good book, but a bit candy coated.","Meaning there is great deal of information about the astral plane that needs further and more cautious discussion. While I do not recommend against this book, it is certainly not the work of an adept, regardless of the level of experience the author might have. I recommend this work, and the works of G. Travels--especially the Phenomenology of Astral Magic-- to get a more well rounded and appropriate answer to one's questions.The astral planes are far more dangerous than one thinks."
3,Not to sure about this one,"It has great info and but in the first part of the book it is written in such a complicated method as to be nearly-impossible to understand. If I was you I would skip Chapter 1 parts 1 thru 4, theres no way you can understand them. Also, it seems the author completely missed the fact that trying to explain vague Eastern principle in a Western method is a hopeless endeavor.Once you get past the first 4 parts the rest of the book should be easier to understand.If your looking to skip all the technicalities that are in this book and you would like to learn this activity straightforward get the books by William L Buhlman or Robert Peterson and skip this book."
4,"Good book, annoying cd","This book is pretty good. I made the mistake of lending it to someone, so I will never see my copy of ""Astral Dynamics"" again. ""Astral Dynamics"" gives information about dreaming in general, as well as tips for inducing lucid dreaming and out of body experiences. I will definitely buy the book in the future. The cd that comes with the book is annoying, so I only listened to it once."
2,It just a mish mash and nothing really new in it,"Reading the other reviews you'd think this book was the best thing since sliced bread. But I found it boring. Nothing really new in it. Just the same old stuff you can read about on the Internet. The author appears to be relying on the fact that to many people this topic is very new. So they don't actually know how out-dated Robert Bruce's ideas are. Monroe was streets ahead, in my opinion. Bruce is still floundering in the real-time zone claiming he's ""advanced"". He really has little idea about the wider reality. In my view he is just one-eye in the land of the blind!"
1,"Don't buy it, worst book ever read.","This is the far more the worst book I have ever read, author mumble around and not able to get to the point, 100 % wrong information about astral projection. I am shock no one ever notice this. Don't buy the book because of the cover. I have just got my refund from the seller. You will do the same if you buy this book. Don't buy it, waste of time."
5,A must-read for any serious student of the OBE phenomenon,"This is perhaps the most serious and comprensive books available on the Out of Body Experience (astral projection). It combines in-depth research of the phenomenon with detailed technniques and instruction on how-to-have an OBE. The author has spent years studying states of consciousness related to OBE and Lucid dreaming, which becomes clear as you read the book. Having read about every book that exists on the topic (and if the reader has been interested in OBE, you would know there are not too many books that could be labeled serious or even just ""good""), I would say that this one is at the very top of the list. I would call it a classic, without any reservation."
5,A Captivating read,It took for me more than a month to finish this book amidst all the other day-to-day activities. I am happy that the book kept things interesting all thru-out. Robert Bruce can be immediately recognized as one who has had first-hand experiences about the things he writes about. He is also frank in admitting that he does not know for certain about various phenomenon and gives plausible theories for them and urges the reader to find out the truth. This gives greater credibility to the author and his words and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. This book is a great companion (or in fact the primary partner) for Rob's other book: Mastering Astral Projection.
2,Shame on National Geographic,"I watched this video with my sons (aged 4 and 6). There is some great footage of volcanos, as one would expect, and I did learn some things about different kinds of volcanos that I didn't know. However, the dumb cast and story of them landing in an alien spaceship on volcanos leaves a lot to be desired. Typical of the rubbish remarks in this video are: ""No, you pinhead."";""'No, it's not.' ' Snot?'""; ""The volcano barfs its guts out."" And it goes on and on. We have a collection of informative videos, which my boys enjoy every bit as much as this one, that don't use this sort of language. Do kids really need this kind of crudeness to get them interested in volcanos? I think not. In the future I shall borrow National Geographic titles from the library to preview them before buying."
4,A good fast reference,I'm a 6th year medical student finishing my final exams. I've found this a great reference when I need to review the basics of specific medical diseases fast while reading larger texts. Great for it's intended purpose. Just don't try to use this as your only textbook.
2,Not quite what you'd expect,"This book isn't bad if you have no access to the documentation or online tutorials already available for SDL. The book is really short and doesn't go into depth in any one area. There is only a brief mention of using SDL with OpenGL and nothing more. Save your money, there's enough tutorials out there online that you can get more from, than in this book. Instead of calling it ""Focus on SDL"" the title should be ""A Glance at SDL"" because that's all that you are getting."
4,"Good beginner's book, but brief.","On the positive side, this book is an excellent entry-level programmer's guide to the SDL library. Anybody with basic coding skills should be able to easily follow the examples (which, by the way, are not duplicated in print... something to keep in mind if you are reading this on the train). Surely you could learn all you need to from SDL's own web site and other online documentation. But if you prefer to sit down and read a book cover to cover, like I do, this book might be a better fit.My biggest disappointment is that there is no coverage of OpenGL at all. My attraction to SDL is to use as a base platform for OpenGL coding. A chapter on OpenGL integration would have won a fifth star from me.I would like to have seen more advanced and in-depth coverage. Maybe another chapter or so on implementing an example game using the framework given to us in the final section."
2,Dishonest,"This author is using information in the this book, specifically the ""Pre-Game Speech"", without the permisson of the original author and without crediting the author of this material. As the above reviewer notes, this ""speech"" was not actually given by Tressel, so the author is factually incorrect. As for the rest of the book, I have no idea, wouldn't buy because of the dishonesty in the first pages."
3,Nice but not exactly as advertised,"I gave this as a gift and the recipient loved it. I'd give it more stars except for two things: Amazon says this tshirt is 100% cotton: IT IS NOT. It's a cotton/poly 50/50 blend (as it is described on the Yours On Demand website which I visited later). Also, these are cut more like men's tshirts; I ordered a medium adult for a woman and it definitely ran on the big side."
5,Emile Henry Couleurs Cobalt Salad Plates,"The product I received is a genuine Emile Henry product, and it is evident that the salad plates are not a ""second"". I am very pleased."
4,2005 VW Jetta Wagon,"It said it would fit my 2005 VW Jetta Wagon's rear window and it did. The ""Winter"" part just means they covered the support mechanism with rubber - which makes it a little harder to install, but I got it on there. The next time I have to buy one of these I might try to find one that isn't setup for winter.I've heard that some Jetta's have 14"" or a 15"" blade, and that you should measure your current wiper beforehand. Mine was 14.5, so I figured this was close enough and I was right."
1,Disappointed,I ordered Nars blush in albatross and lovejoy. Reading all the reviews it appeared that both these show up on medium tan skin beautifully. I am so disappointed especially after having spent $50 on both. The color does not show up on my skin and after applying several coats it does not stay put for long. I am also breaking out on my cheeks where I never use to have breakouts. Wish I could return them.
4,Nars Blush Orgasm,This product is perfect for fair skin complexion and blonds. It adds nice pinkish sheer and glow to your face. It is ok for olive skin complexion. Doesn't have the same look it looks just OK. For blonds-5 for olove skin-3NARS Blush Orgasm
5,"Gorgeous, flattering color.","Let me say that I don't wear makeup all that often, that is until I bought this. I now wear NARS Orgasm every day, even if I am not wearing any other makeup. The color is so gorgeous and flattering. It's not just pink, but has these lovely gold tones in it without being sparkly. I threw out all my other blush colors, this is my one and only now."
4,for my five minute face,"Orgasm is one of those shades that I can toss into a bag with a mascara, eyeliner, lipgloss, and concealer and have everything I need to make a quick getaway. If I only have a few minutes and don't want to weed through three train cases of my beauty essentials, then I always know I can count on this shade to give me a fresh, healthy glowing look. Definitely one I would replace if I ran out but this lasts a *really* long time!"
5,Excellent Product!,I am very fair skinned and this blush compliments my skin tone perfectly! I love it! Definitely would highly recommend this blush.
5,Great product,Love my product :)It was mailed on time and packaged well. I would buy again from this vendor.Happy with my purchase. :)
1,"Too many parabens... Parabens can mimic the hormone estrogen, which is known to play a role in the development of breast cancers","Parabens are used as a preservative so that products have less of a chance at growing bacteria. But I own other cosmetics that are the same price that DO NOT contain these harmful chemicals. ZuZu Luxe for example. Or, Lavera Natur Kosmetik neither of these have parabens. They don't have a ton of different colors to choose from but at least they will look natural for everyday use.I would expect lower end brands to contain parabens because they are cheaper to make. Here are some sources:[...][...][...][...]"
2,Not very good,"I don't understand why everyone seems to love this. I bought it with great expectations but found it to disappear very quickly. The color is pretty, but it doesn't last long."
3,I missed it,"I can not speak much of this item, because the reception of the hotel I was staying, lost NARS Amour blush that I bought."
3,"Very, very reflective HIGHlighter","This highlighter is a gorgeous gold color, but it is incredibly reflective. I've tried lots of other highlighters - Bobbi Brown, Chanel, Sephora and none of them came close to how reflective this product is. It is really pretty, but I wouldn't dream of wearing this during the day. It's great for a night out."
3,Not as expected..,Since i was hearing and reading that orgasm nash blush was the most used and better for most skin types i wanted to try it. It looks good with my completion (medium light skin) but needed to apply more in order to be more noticeable. But color is good..
3,super concentrated color!,"This blush is SO intense I find it hard to apply. I'm very fair and this makes me look sunburned! I have to put light powder over it to tone it down. The good news is it should last forever since so little is needed. I use a big brush and a light touch and it's still too rosy.If you're fair, try a really light color."
4,Nice. Bright! Sparkly,"I like this blush but I have to use a light hand. I rarely wear much makeup, but in the winter this blush is just right for making me look a bit more alive."
1,NARS,"I generally like NARS blushes but this is a new color for me. The color I was using is no longer available and this looked very close so I decided to try it. It goes on VERY orange. I looked like a clown. It is not the same as shown in the picture. Regretfully, I just cannot use it so I wasted my money"
4,Best Blush? YES,"Highly pigmentated and goes on so nicely. Nars does not disappoint. I have to see how this blush treats me until the end, for me to truly make a judgement on it but I can say it is comparable to Tarte's dollface. I think this blush goes well on ivory skin which is what I have (in the winter). The packaging alone can make me continue to purchase this blush because it is so beautiful!"
4,Good product,"Great product if used correctly, however i used a eyeshawdow from the BH cosemetics 88 pallette before purhcasing this and it provides the same effect for a much cheaper price."
4,Love it,"I purchased this awhile ago to add to my Nars Blush collection. I already had Taos and Exhibit A. I love the sheer orangy color that Taj Mahal gives my skin. It's like a nice vacation sunset and it really warms my skin. As with all Nars blushes, use a light hand and you wont be disappointed."
3,not wat i expected,"I really love NARS blushes and I always am searching for the perfect color. I gave torrid a try because I am an light olive skin complexion and I thought it would look great on me. It almost looks clownish. :( I'm not saying for everyone out there it will be, but i really wanted this to be the go to blush and it def isn't. And you may think i put a heavy swatch on but that's only because the first application didn't really show. Just my opinion. I will still be buying NARS blushes because my quest for the perfect blush hasn't been cured yet.UPDATE: I still own this product and i have to say, ive taken a liking to it. It looks good on the apples of my cheeks, Too much will be too much. Ha. It has good pigment too."
5,pretty and longlasting,Will definitely buy this again--- it lasts forever and gives such a pretty flush to the face! Saw it recommended on a blog and I'm so glad I went for it.
5,Nars Blush is great,"Love never having to guess on blush color. Might me a little pricey, but it lasted me almost a year, which is a good value"
5,Nalo Top Pick,"Orgasm blush now been around a while and is a classic must have in your makeup bag, it gives the skin a nice color with a shimmer. This is a must have, I also like LoveJoy. Nalo Jones professional makeup artist based in Los Angeles, [...]"
4,Nars blush in Sin,I really love this blush. It goes on well and is a beautiful rosey berry color. I removed one star because of the price.
3,Not good if you already have orange going on...,"I love NARS blushes!But this one, not good for me. Not in any way.If you already have some kind of 'orange' vibe going on, you probably want to steer away from this one. I am pasty pale with auburn/copper red hair, this just made me look like the Wendy's sign. It was not good with my base coloring.I gave it 3 because no matter that the color looks bad on me, the product quality is still there. This would look incredible on someone with pigment in their skin, I'm almost envious of anyone who could wear this, just because it's so pretty in the pan. If you are darker than 'fresh death', this color will probably work on you. Just like any other NARS blush, a light hand will go a lot farther than digging in. You can always add to, but woe be to you if you put on too much of this stuff right off the bat."
5,Great Color!,"I hear all the hype about Orgasm...I wasn't impressed. The color doesn't work for me at all. I have a caramel complexion. However, Deep Throat is AMAZING! This is my go to color. I use it year round and have recieved compliments on it as well. I am going to venture out and try Desire, Taj Mahal, and Exhibit A next. I will be back to let you know how those worked for me as well. Great Stuff! Def. one of my favorite Blushes!"
4,"Well written, motivational and rigorous.","This book cover the basics of partial differential equations. It's well written, motivational, and balanced rigorous. It contains a lot of good exercises which is a necessity for a beginner in this field. I read this book during a university course in the subject. I struggled. But in my opinion this book is pretty close to the ideal presented by Einstein: ""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler""."
5,this is a MUST HAVE item for any serious lasagna chef,"If you bake lasagna for a large family, I cannot emphasize enough how much this pan adds to the quality of the product. This pan is so deep that it will accomodate three full boxes of pasta, even if you stuff your lasagna with pounds of meat and cheese. We regularly bake a twelve layer lasagna in this pan for family. Once it comes out of the oven, it stays hot for HOURS. The enamel finish is outstanding and so easy to clean that you will never ever go back to using a glass baking dish for your messy baked items.The only downside to this product is that, by design, it is very heavy and the handles/tabs for lifting are disproportionatly small for its size. When it is full of piping hot lasagna in the oven it must weigh 30-40 pounds. That can be akward and my wife is afraid to even attempt to lift it so I am called in."
3,never deep enough for me,"It cleans up great and the pan is deep, but there are pans just as good without the big name or big price tag"
4,Great heavy lasagna pan,"This is a great looking 9x13 pan with good proportions. It is really deep and makes a great tall lasagna. It is extremely heavy when fully loaded with a lasagna. Its bulk gives it even cooking in the oven, but can be difficult to get out of the oven after your lasagna is done. I have made many other things in this pan with great results. It is fairly non-stick and has not stained even after several lasagnas. The enamel is fairly bulletproof.Overall I really like this pan, with its only weakness being heft. However, that heft is put to good use in very even cooking and keeping the lasagna warm at the table.You won't be disappointed."
5,multi purpose pan is great,"This came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the Holidays. As a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation. As a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb. chickens. It's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck. The pan looks good from oven to table. Yes - it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron, but I'm really glad to add this to my pantry."
4,Forget the recipe book,"Spent over 80 bucks for the lovely lasagna pan. Yes, it's heavy, but it's a wonderful pan. I found it VERY irritating that the free recipe book didn't include ""whole"" recipes. Within the recipes it says things like: 2 cups basic tomato sauce (then, ""See pg 71 of Molto Italiano cookbook""). Well, I don't own that cookbook and I certainly think they could have printed the entire recipe... otherwise, what good is it?"
5,Great Deep Dish Lasagna!!!,"Yes, this is heavy, 10 lbs 3 ozs to be exact; but that is what you should be wanting for a quality piece of cast iron. This is a great piece of cookware for deep dish lasagna as it measures a full 13"" x 9"" x 3"" deep. This is a very good quality product even tho' it is made in China; I would buy American made but could find no other product with the heft and size of this one, and the bake pans offered by Le Cruset are shallow in comparison. I purchased the Chiati color and am very pleaed and impressed with the quality of the finish. I just made a lasagna with double the recipe of Ragu Bolonese and handmade pasta ([...]) this past weekend and it all fit wonderfully into this pan, and baked up beautifully in the stipulated bake time. I'm sure it would work equally well for mac & cheese or other casseroles! Also, the cleanup was easy with just a short soak in soapy water, and the pan looks like new again.Believe me; you will not be dissappointed in this purchase!!!"
3,My son was over it the same day I bought it.,This game is about taking pictures in the cartoon world of specific things. I forget the reason since he hasn't played with it in over a year.
3,Warning: No Japanese language track for main episodes,"The description of the discs are misleading:# Format: Collector's Edition, Color, Dolby, DVD, Limited Edition, NTSC, Original recording remastered, Subtitled# Language: English, Japanese# Subtitles: EnglishFor the main collection of episodes, there is only an English track with no subtitles. There is only one single episode with a Japanese language track and subtitles. The 52 episodes on the main discs do not have a Japanese language track or subtitles.Do not buy the discs if you want the Japanese language track and subtitles.Another Osamu Tezuka collection ""Astroboy"" does have a Japanese language track and subtitles."
2,Beware - English Audio!,"I just opened my box, and was terribly disappointed -- although the information for this DVD set claims that it includes both English and Japanese language, it is in fact just the English version.That being said, the quality is good, the extras are nice, and it looks like it'll be good watching. At least the voices are experienced radio actors, and do justice to the story."
5,THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I own this dvd box set, and IT'S AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GOOD quality in EVERYTHING, it's really cool. I love it!The booklet tells about how Kimba came to be on television and how they made it, really good.As for the DVD's themselves. Awesome.There is also a bonus disk with special features on it. Once again, awesome. This is well worth your money and time if you're a Kimba fan.KIMBA THE WHITE LION IS THE ONE!"
4,beltclip,This belt clip was exactly what I need to replace the broken one for my Golflogix gps it worked like a charm.
3,OK for the price,I purchased this to replace an earlier one that broke. IMHO it is OK for the price.
2,Clip is cheap,This clip does not have a ratchet mechanism that better clips have so my phone does not stay upright but rather hangs upside down.
1,Clip Defective,"Wow the clip I bought from here is defective, there is about a 2 cm space between the front of the clip and the back of the clip which makes it impossible for it to stay put. I had purchased this clip before but it broke, now I got this defective one and there is no way to talk to the seller.Bad choice, I am going to have to look for another seller."
4,"Handy clip, good price, free rotation",Is a little thick so the device sticks out a bit far and it has no locking positions so it rotates freely and sometimes I have to spin it around to reach the release button on my phone to answer but good price and fairly strong. Used a pop rivit to reattach to my seidio holster to replace the broken clip. If you can glue the lock button high on your device so it will stay upright. Quick shipping.
2,"Great paper, but not a great value","While it's true that this paper has a high brightness rating, its utility is plagued by the question of market. Whom is it trying to reach? It's labeled to be specifically useful to HP printer owners, so if you're not in that group, you can keep on shopping. But if you do have an HP printer, one of the things you'll immediately notice is how great they are, by-and-large, at the job of reproducing color. So good have been the models released in the last two years, in fact, that it's actually quite difficult for the average layperson to see the difference between work completed on this and similarly high-contrast paper made by Xerox or other, more traditional paper manufacturers. So then the question becomes, why would you spend so much money for 200 sheets of this paper, when you could elsewhere get equally bright paper at higher quantities for a lower price?I'm still not sure of the answer to that one."
3,nice but not supportive enough,"runs small, not really enough support to be used for sports like running, but light workouts or something would work."
2,too small,"Its suppose to be 36C but it is not a 36. Not even close to going around my chest when all the other nursing bras I have are 36. It looks nice and is high quality, but does not fit."
4,Interesting Reading,"An intelligent, clearly written book by Harvard microbiologist and social activist Jon Beckwith. He describes his eventful life in science and activism, and makes some interesting points about the nature of science: ""the actual practice of science is a human endeavor with the flaws and virtues of any human activity."" He emphasizes the importance of ethics in science, and says that scientists and non-scientists must work together for science to help mankind, and not be used unwisely. I knew Beckwith years ago when I lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wish him well with the book."
1,RIP OFF!!!,"This perhaps is one of the greatest deceptions of this DECADE. I have 2 of these. What they DO NOT TELL YOU is this:A. If this thing is SO user friendly.....then why are they now promoting ""Teaching Techniques"" for such a ""simple"" product???B. It would be easier to raise the Titanic with a snorkel and finns than to get any kind of ""technical help"" from this company. The ONLY time you get to talk to a REAL PERSON is when you buy and that's it.THEY ARE SIMPLY LYING ABOUT WHAT THEIR PRODUCT CAN AND CANNOT DO.C.Did you know that if you buy a PC within the last 5 years IT ALREADY COMES WITH SIMILAR SOFTWARE ON IT FOR FREE????READ THE FINEPRINT ON THIS PEICE OF #*&%! before spending $1 on it."
1,Fell off dashboard,"I mounted it on a cool day in the shade, allowed 24 hours for it to set. The next day it was 100 degrees outside. The mount fell right off. I didn't even put anything in it. I mounted on a flat area too. So be prepared to use the screws and mess up your dashboard if you buy this and live in a hot area."
1,Shocking gum,"This product is not a good toy. It shocks too hard and is not fun. I got people very angry with me and No one liked it. It is a terrible toy, and a painful one."
3,Horses,I was hoping the book made it easier to identify the different breeds of horses.The phots are very nice.
3,Well...,"The pictures are nice. But otherwise this is just your average guidebook to horses. The information is easy to understand and some of it, like the heights of horses, is represented visually. But if you are looking to know a little bit about a lot of breeds, this would be a good book for you."
4,lots of information,"This book was excellent for my 8yr. old. It contains lots of information on horses without being too overwhelming. The color photos and scale depictions of size really captured her interest. I would definitely recommend this book for kids who are not actively involved in equestrian activities but want to learn more about different breeds of horses. The one draw-back I found was that my daughter collects figurines of different breeds, and some we just could not find in the book."
2,not what I expected,"This book was not what i expected.It was too short, too general and just too darn boring.It didn t have enough illustrations and the ones that are there arn t very good.There was not enough info on the classification of horses ex. breeds,region of living,origins,just not enough.Susan Mcbane's Illustrated Encyclopedia of HORSE BREEDS was much better---just wish i had bought it first."
2,I can't recommend this case,"it fits perfectly, but is very hard to remove. The clip falls off constantly. It's getting two stars for fit and loses three for the clip being worthless and being almost impossible to remove without damaging it."
1,Sent the wrong product. AGAIN!,"I recieved the tubing with the off-white connectors on one end, and the raw edges on the other. This was my third try at purchasing replacement tubing on Amazon, and I just keep getting the wrong thing and having to deal with a huge hassle. I usually go to Amazon for everything, but there seems to be a screwup in their system regarding these tubes. Really irritating!"
2,Not original tubing,This product does the job but it is not the original tubing that comes with the Medela products. This tubing is thinner (lower grade).
3,The other reviews are right....call Medela for free tubes!,"Calling Medela DOES work. The first time that I called months ago, they wouldn't do it. However, this time when I called I mentioned that I heard that they give 1 free set of complimentary tubing and she just asked when I purchased the pump (I bought it used, but just told them the date that I bought it and left out the part that I bought it used;)) and then asked for my address to ship it! It was as easy as that! Not sure if I just got someone who didn't know, but it pays to be persistent!!:)"
3,This tubing is somehow different than the original Medela tubing,"This tubing works but it's different from the tubing that came with the pump originally, I have more problems with the tubing purchased here."
1,Got a free pair from Medela,I took the suggestion of the other reviewers that said they got these free and I have a pair coming to me as well from Medela...Save the money and call their 1-800 number and get a free pair...
3,Review NOT on tubing,"I too called the 1-800-435-8316 number for Medela and received the tubing for free along with free shipping. Just wanted to update that as of 2010, they are still offering this courtesy service."
1,Keep trying,"Per other reviewer's suggestion I tried calling the Medela 1800 # (1-800-435-8316) and was told at first that they sell the tubes for $10. I tried again the next day and got a different operator and she sent them to me for free. So just try again if you aren't successful at first getting them for free! By the way, don't mention that your pump is used (if it is), they will give you a shpeel on FDA regulation and not send you the tubes."
1,DON'T BUY - MEDELA WILL SEND FOR FREE!,Just call Medela and they will send you the replacement tubing - brand new - for free (including shipping!) What a fantastic company!
5,"Tubing falls off easily, got replacement for free","I was about to purchase new tubings when I read the reviews to call the 1-800 number. The rep was very nice and is shipping the new tubings for free.I had problems with the tubings falling off the connection to the pump. So I cut the tubing every month by a centimeter or so to get a more snug fit to the pump connector. Of course, that made it shorter and shorter.In addition, I was steam cleaning the tubing in the Medela steam bags every couple of months for sanitizing purposes. I asked the rep if that was a good idea and she suggested that it was not necessary. The only time she said to clean the tubings is if milk back flowed into the tubings. Otherwise the risk of the tubings getting damaged in the Medela steam bags is too great.So I'm very pleased with the service and am waiting for my replacement tubings to arrive in one week."
1,Get them FREE!,"Thanks to all the other wonderful reviewer's advice, I too called the 1-800 Medela number and they are sending me a complimentary set, especially for my machine. Great way to save $10."
3,Didn't fit right,"These tubes didn't fit my pump, even though it's supposed to. I just cut off the ends and fit the tubing directly to my pump face, works fine."
2,Not worth it!,"I purchased this for my trip to Mexico... save your money and either buy a good one or don't buy one at all. This did not have most of the basic translations I needed to even get around. It does have a translation from Spanish to English which I thought would be helpful but even that was useless. I handed it to someone who spoke no English so he could type in his word and then I could translate to English... No Luck! After lots of frustration, I just gave up trying to use it."
3,An ok thing.,"I was expecting more vocabulary, but the one that comes with it is actually helpful, so I guess it's ok. I think it's a good product to have if it's needed. The price is also good for the product itself.Esperaba que el vocabulario incluido en el producto fuese mas extenso pero no es asi necesariamente. Mas sin embargo, el vocabulario existente es de suficiente ayuda, pienso yo. No esta tan mal el producto. Por el precio, creo que es un buen producto que obtener si se necesita."
2,Franklin Spanish-English Dictionary,Packaging is so difficult to remove and the attachment for the cover is so delicate that the cover broke off from the body of the device when it was opened. Not recommended until packaging and design is changed.
2,Dic w/o conjugation,Conjugation is vital for spanish! This dic has very little to none. If you already know how to conjugate then this is a good dic but if you don't then this will still be a big problemo for you!
1,hard to read and understand,"Spanish-English-Spanish dictionary on MMC Card for Franklin EbookmansI found the Franklin Spanish English dictionary very difficult to use. First, it is not easy to see the screen unless you are in excellent light. Second, the directions for use are insufficient and I have not been able to type in an English word and get the Spanish word and the monitor to say the word in Spanish. The only way I have figured out how to use it is to type in the English word and get the Spanish spelling and then type in the Spanish word. I thought this would be a great way to learn the pronounciations as well as the spellings of words I knew in English and wanted to know the Spanish pronounciations. However, I have found it so time consuming and difficult that I've given up and ordered a regular book dictionary."
1,English Dictionary Sucks!,"The Spanish to English and vice versa is ok but extremely low level. Many times I would input a word in English and it gave me a very similar word in Spanish, only adding the a for the gender difference (masculine or feminine).The batteries always died within a month. When I called the company they said ""sorry, we don't cover that.""Also, the English dictionary is horrible. There were more words that I could not find than find. I constantly had to keep going to a regular dictionary."
2,**Don't buy this if you are a serious Español Student**,"I am majoring in Spanish in college. I needed something to help me with my homework. This is a good dictionary, but the verb conjugation is designed very badly. You have to hit a function key and an arrow key to move between tenses-then there is a little ""page turning"" symbol for 4 seconds.That means if I want to get to the subjective tense, it will take 40 seconds of watching that stupid little symbol turning ""pages"" and pressing buttons over and over. If I wanted to turn pages, I'd use the book. The long and the short is, I can conjugate verbs quicker with my 501 verbs book than this thing. When you enter a conjugated verb in, it does not translate it for you, it goes to the dictionary and gives you the infinitive. If you want to replace your dictionary, this will do ok, and buying the flash card makes it almost a PDA, but the card did not work right either. I'm not interested in buying any other Franklin products after this."
5,"Great produce, great customer service","I upgraded to this translator after using a more simple one for years. I am very satisfied with this product. I live and work in Latin America and use Spanish on a daily basis. Most words that I need a translation for are in this compact, user friendly. It has a good display and many helpful features as well as educational games that I enjoy. It fits nicely in a waist pack so I can carry it everywhere. The verb conjugation feature is great.Lastly, the customer service from Franklin has been exceptional. They respond quickly to any questions and/or problems. In the anonymous web shopping world, it was refreshing to find a company that stands behind their product with a friendly, helpful, and accomodating staff.I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND THIS COMPANY!!!!"
2,Would be fine if you could read it -- NOT RECOMMENDED,"I've used mine for about a week now, and honestly, I would not buy it again (I'm returning it), due to the very poor screen. It is really not readable unless you get it under a VERY bright light. Other than that, it seems to work ok, but the screen is a killer.Ron"
4,Great tool for practicing Spanish!,"I bought this product after seeing my Spanish teacher use it for several months. It's worth the price and I like that it fits in my purse. I enjoy playing the games and I like the examples of useage that it gives when looking up a vocabulary word. I know it has helped me improve my Spanish. A major disappointment is that due to the dark screen, its almost impossible to use it in dim lighting such as while lying in bed or in a dimly lit restaurant."
4,Good,"It is exactly what I needed,it has a lot of words and translations and the price is great.I'm happy about my purchase."
4,Almost 5 stars,"This item comes in very handy. In some light it's a little hard to see, but you can move it around. I'm very glad I got it, it sure beats carrying around a heavy dictionary."
4,Franklin Merriam Webster Dictionary,"On the whole, I like this product.Definitions and conjugations are useful.I have found that not all common words are in it.It is compact and easy to carry.The instructions say that if the battery is not changed quickly,information I have input will be lost. I have not had the opportunity to test this, but it seems to be a disadvantage."
5,Nice for the price!,"Franklin DBE-1490 Merriam-Webster Spanish-English DictionaryThis translator is really nice for the price. It is strictly aSpanish-English translator (no other language) and has about 5 milliontranslations. That is why I bought this particular one. It has many ways to learn Spanish or English; like a word list, games, phrases, verb conjugation, and one can look up a word in either language. It is a realhandy tool for traveling or just learning. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,Great product,"I love my new dictionary. My only complaint is that I cannot translate phrases. There are several english and spanish phrases that they have pre-translated for you, but you can't translate you own. Otherwise, I love it! It is much better to keep in my backpack than a full paper dictionary."
3,Conjugation lacking,"I found the conjugation feature frustrating. Only the 'I' form of the verb is listed which is limiting. I wanted help having conversations with people asking them about themselves or other people/things not just always talking about myself. I ended up guessing at the 'you, he, she, it' forms of the verbs instead. I did enjoy learning new words and definitions with the hangman game. You guess the word then have the option to look up the definition. Its a fun way to build vocabulary."
2,Franklin Electronic Spanish/English Dictionary,"This is a handy item, but rather limited in content. It doesn't contain the majority of Spanish words I search for."
1,Way too Expensive !!!!,"I've took these pills for years and quality is top notch. However, I've noticed that recently price on them went way up! In August of 2011 I've paid under thirty eight bucks for these, however, now I can't find them for less the fifty which is way too much for any vitamin unless it gives eternal life. Oh well, looks like I'll have to drop Pure Essence and go with similar, cheaper alternative."
5,The best Vitamin Product EVER!!!,I am thrilled to having finally found a great Multi Vitamin that is natural and goes way beyond covering all bases.The size of the pills is huge but knowing the good they contain I am willing to overlook this.Absolutely excellent product that I will order again!
5,Life essence review,This product is great and I have been using it for several years. Highly recommend it.
4,Diamond in the Rough,"a wonderful blend of so many styles of music coming together in layer after layer of complexity. The musical content meanders at times but is brought back to focus as soon as the singer opens her mouth. Nancy Jones sounds like five of herself. You are commanded to listen to this voice that is so enormous. This is obviously a band who put in a lot of work prior to recording. The drummer, Devon Ryan is like Kieth Moon meets Bohnam. The keyboardist,Mark Sherkus, who plays a myriad of sounds is icing on the cake-sweetly & perfectly in and out. appropriatly. This group of very talented musicians is a rare find and I personally was thrilled to discover them."
2,doesn't spin with cat sitting on top,"I would have expected that the Motor Mouse would be constructed in such a way that the cat could play with the mouse while sitting on top of the toy. My cat is average-sized, and yet her slight weight compresses the housing enough that the mouse will no longer spin."
3,Mixed experience,"The kitten likes it (though being a kitten likes anything that moves), the big cat is interested only sometimes.On the plus side, the batteries last ages."
2,great for a day or two - breaks down,"So, I bought this at a local pet store. My cats loved it at first. The motor didn't really want to work, so I had to push it a bit to start it. It eventually stopped altogether after only a few days of play."
2,I played w/it more than the cat,"Bought motor mouse at a pet store for the price and allure of a cool toy for the cat. I give it two stars for the idea behind it but only two stars because of the severe design flaw. As other reviewers have stated weight on top of the unit will keep the mouse from ""running"". Upon further tweaking it is next to impossible to get the center sufficiently pulled away to allow unrestricted movement without a heat source to allow for greater flexibility in the pulling of the center. Save your money or take it back and buy a sturdier unit whether for more money or a smaller one for the same."
2,Moves too fast,"The mouse moves about 90mph and confused my cat as to how to see it much less catch it. Then he put his paw in there and it stopped easily, then when he let go it was just a blur again. He likes it better with no battery and swats it around from time to time. He doesn't use the top for clawing either even with catnip sprinkled on it - so I don't know; I wish someone would invent a motorized mouse that he could chase around the house - That's something he would love! He needs a real challenge."
5,The most effective trap in the market! Must buy if you have mice.,"I tried six other kinds of traps including the basic traps, victory traps, glue traps, etc. I think this is by and far the best engineered and most effective trap out there. Easy to set, it's actually reusable with the setting bar on top so you never have to touch trapping bar, very low risk of snapping yourself, and the bait area is the only sensitive area which is what you want! After 6 months of using other traps and watching glue traps get knocked around but not catching anything in them and watching peanut butter bait consistently disappear, I nearly gave up. But after my first day using these traps I caught one (so I had to immediately jump on Amazon to review the trap!) and am happy my place might be rodent free in a few days. Very, very happy with this trap."
5,Mice are gross,It kills the mouse but doesn't make a huge mess. Easy to release the mouse. Or so my husband tells me because this is his job. But it works.
2,Catch brid instead.,"I purchased this product in hope to catch some mice that ravished my tomato plants.It's easy to set up and have the indicator when it aimed but not well design enough to do the job. ice escape from the trap and leaved their tail on it. It caught few birds (not even kill them, just pinch them down)."
3,Digging a little deeper,"This book is has a lot of detail about the layout of the land, it's structures and the way of life on the isle. Although it is a little hard to read, if you are looking to dig a little deeper into the life John was living at the time he received revelations, this book can provide some information you may not find anywhere else. This book was written around a personal experience on the Isle of Patmos and provides customs and practices as well as a little superstition believed by those who abide there."
2,feature packed but inconsistant,"I bought this product right when it came out. I took the risk because it had every feature I was looking for and more. The Skyfi3 is easy to use in the home and on the road, and up to snuff as a portable device with the added accessories. The problem is...well there are many. The device often freezes when trying to boot up. The internal memory that stores your recorded XM content becomes corrupted on a regular basis. Sometimes the device doesn't know how to recognize the car dock and freezes up. Sometimes the screen doesn't even display any information even though sound is being pumped to your speakers. Too bad."
3,Mediocre Unit (At Best),"Its a pretty package and has a nice display but still has some software bugs. When it does lock up there is no way to reset or take the battery out so you literally have to wait for the battery to die to reset the unit. The FM modulator for playing over the radio in your car is prone to interference and static. It looks and sounds great in my boom box but is not impressive in the car. The antenna included in the unit and car kit can cut out fairly easily when being moved. I think they may have cut a few corners to keep overall cost down on this unit. I do like the remote controle and I do Love the XM stations. Will probably eventually buy a better unit unless the online software upgrades make a difference.Update: I did do the firmware upgrade and if anything its even more ""buggy"" and the FM modulator is still worthless for car use. If I could change my selection I would downgrade it to one star."
1,Piece of Junk,"Please do yourself a BIG favor and DO NOT buy any delphi satellite radio receivers. After buying a MyFi and going through two of those, plus the battery recall it finally died after only two years of use. Bought the SKYFI3, did the updates and same thing happened. After two years it too has failed. Won't retain preset channels, reboots for no reason and then loses all presets. User interface menus are clunky, murky and non intuitive. Whoever programmed this should find another career. Am going to another vendor as Delphi has clearly dropped the ball on this and the myfi units."
2,Great unit when it works...,"If you don't mind a unit that works when it wants to, and not when you want it to, this might be the one for you. I have never had a piece of electronic equipment that was so quirky. Trouble is, I can never reach the point that I will toss it, because tomorrow it might decide to work. It is the kind of equipment you mght give to someone you don't really like. It will drive them up the wall. I can't believe that they let this one stay on the market. It really gives Delphi a bad image and I would never select their gear again even over an unknown competitor. But, yours might be working...for now."
2,Horrible XM Unit,I got this unit for my birthday just under a year ago.The volume is much lower than the Roady2 I had before this. I have a pretty nice system in my car and i have to max out all of the settings on the unit AND turn the volume up all the way in my car to hear it loud enough.Also everytime I turn the unit on all the settings and favorites have been erased so I have to turn up all of the settings everytime I start my car.I mainly use this unit at work at my desk plugged into the home kit. When I answer the phone or leave my desk Ill pause the unit. Sometimes Ill build up to an hour of delay. Ill be listening and all of a sudden it jumps 40 minutes forward to the middle of a commercial and the worst part is IT WONT LET ME REWIND BACK!!The one and only good thing ill say is the screen is very bright and easy to read at night in my car.Overall this is a cheap unit. Since purchasing Ive read so many horrible reviews on this and would not recommend buying this unit.
1,poor connections,"We purchased this unit new. Right out of the box, when installed had error logs of bad connectivity. This item was professionally installed. Had to return."
1,horrible,"I sold this off after owning for 6 months. The concept was great, the execution was horrible."
1,Jeez....,"Ordered two, one for the wife, one for myself. UPS is sceduled to deliver tomorrow. After reading these reviews I think I'll return them unopened.."
1,SkyFi3 Part Deux,This is the 2nd SkyFi3 I bought. The first one lasted a little over 2yrs then kept freezing and locking up while listening to it. The 2nd one was a good deal and we had accessories already in place in the truck and MC so I didn't want to buy all new accessories again. Bad idea - this one is just under 2yrs old and is starting to freeze up now. Reception/sound is great but I think the model itself has issues that the company knows about but won't address. Buy something else for goodness sake and don't waste your $$$. I waited to review this due to this fact but wanted everyone to be aware of this possible issue.
4,"Radio Locks Up, How To Fix Easily","I love this radio but have had some problem with it locking up, particularly when using the micro SD card. Pressing the mode button and the up volume control usually will unlock the unit if there is a problem. This didn't work with the SD card problem. I checked the firmware. I had the latest version. I checked the Delphi website and read about ""hard resets"". This does erase your memory so any content is wiped away but I wanted to try it any way. This didn't fix the locking up problem either. So I called Delphi. Got a great tech, who was easy to understand, and found out that my SD card was probably the problem. He told me to format it using the SkyFi3's format option. That fixed it!! Might be worth trying if your unit locks up too. Delphi's website for technical issues is [...]"
4,Pretty good for the price,"This unit beats its competitors on price. And it appears to do so by using cheap feeling components.However there are certainly no complaints about functionality. I've only had the unit a few days and it has done everything I wanted. I use it in the car to listen on my drive to and from work. After spending some time to find a station where I get the best reception I can say that this is as good, if not better, than my Skyfi2.The sound will never be as good as one that plugs directly into an aux port on your radio, even with the SureConnect. If you have the option to plug in directly, do it.(Update: I've had the unit a couple months now. The buttons on the car adapter and remote are quite finicky. All too often I try to select a station but it moves to somewhere else in the menu. The system is also quite slow to start when I've got a lot of mp3 on the SD card. The lowest volume is also too loud for me -- I had to use earphones with an embedded volume control.)"
3,"Great Radio, but mine still has bugs","This is my third portable xm radio. My first was the Delphi Skyfi2 (excellent unit), the 2nd was Samsung Nexus50 (terrible unit, don't buy it).Like the skyfi2 this unit works as advertised. It is smaller than the 2, has longer memory (10hrs vs. 5hrs) and has a bigger display. It is an evolutionary improvement on the Skyfi2.Unfortunately, my unit freezes up on me. There is no reset switch and you can't power it down when it does freeze up. Your only solution is to drain the battery so the unit power itself down. I would have rated this unit as a 5 star if it wasn't for this problem."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP!!!,"I love the music on XM, but the Skyfi3 is awful. It constantly gets frozen, and you have to ""reboot"" it all the time. I have stopped recording and downloading music because I have lost the memory twice. I will also store my favorite channels, and then for some unknown reason, the channels are erased along with the frequency channel I had previously set."
2,Search for free FM,"The FM transponder is weak to say the least, I spend more time switching channels than I do driving, it's going to be returned. This is a distraction I don't need driving an 18 wheeler."
1,An Academic Approach to 360 Degree Feedback,"The book promotes itself to be a practical, how-to resource, but that isn't the case at all. It gives virtually no guidance about how to implement a 360 degree feedback program on the ground. In truth, it seems a fairly transparent attempt by the author to promote his own feedback system, which is what all too many of these books by consultants do. A huge disappointment."
5,360 Feedback Feedback,This book provides the practical advice for building 360 systems. It is less academic and more informative than the other books available on the subject.
2,I wish we could all love ourselves...,I wish we could all love ourselves as much as Mark R. Edwards and Ann J. Ewen.
4,Worth the money spent,"The old cylinders replaced with these two were somewhat larger around giving a first impression that the new ones wouldn't work properly, as the old ones did. We'll see - I've been wrong before. The fit and function were both as advertised, the items were packaged intelligently and arrived in perfect condition. The rear hatch opens by itself after unlatching at this point now, and stays in the up position, which is what I wanted. No more problems. Much less expensive than purchasing at local automotive stores, and the installation was extermely simple on my vehicle. This install was a very simple job involving removing two fine-threaded screws with a star-point bit driver, removing the old, putting the new units where the old ones were, and replacing the fasteners. For now, all is well with these cylinders. I hope they continue to provide the function desired until I am forced to sell or junk my 2002 Durango SLT."
5,Works great,These are direct replacements for the stock '98 Durango lifts. They are very easy to replace and they work great. I used Amazon to purchase them because it's easy and reliable.
5,works great,Only took minutes to install and works great. Product appears to work as good as or even better than the original liftgate arms. Glad I replaced.
5,Works as advertised,"Great replacement. Took about ten minutes to install, and now tailgate works as good as new. I was able to do it by myself, but I'm 6'5"" so I could prop the tailgate on my head while removing and installing one at a time. I suggest taking the top bolt out last when removing, and replace it first when installing due to the angle of the bolt."
5,Good as advertised,"Auto parts store wanted $40 each for these, spent $36 total for two, installed easy and now the tail gate does not fall and hit me in the head when I'm unloading groceries!"
4,Everything you need to know about IPv6 addressing,"These RFCs are *THE* source material for IPv6 addressing, and Peter Salus has collected all the relevant ones here. Also included are some chapters about topics you simply won't find anywhere else--and a killer index (though the introduction sheds no light on why the included RFCs were chosen).If you're interested in IPv6 addressing, this is the book to buy."
5,Great Watch,"There is one word to describe this watch and the word is Stunning. This watch gather more praise than even my more expensive watches, it just stands out and demand attention from anyone who happen to glance down at your wrist. Having said that there are a few thing i would like to mention about this watch that I think prospective buyer would like to know.The Alarm is almost useless. Setting the alarm to be exact to the minute is practically impossible to do and the sound is not that loud, altho not a problem for me since i have a cellphone for that.This watch is in the heavy side. Not really heavy to be an annoyance but enough for you to feel its there, and I am sure with regular use you would hardly notice.All in all it's a great watch and with Citizen quality and craftsmanship behind it, I am sure you too would fall in love with this watch."
4,Nice looking watch,Good product. In bright sunlight i occasionally cant see the hands clearly but apart from that i am very pleased.
3,A nice looking watch,"I had looked at this watch at neighborhood stores and liked it as soon as I saw it. Its a large watch, which I was looking for.I debated with myself for some time trying to decide if I should get the one with the black face or the one with the light face. Since I have a nice seiko chronograph with a black face, I decide to go for the other one. These are the things that I don't like about the watch. Its very hard to see the hands on the watch.Its actually a little difficult to tell time as the hands blend into the face. Maybe its my eyes, but its difficult to see the date.I think that could have been larger or magnified. I also wish it had a day setting. Setting the date at the end of each month is also a pain. In spite of all this, I still like wearing the watch. I like the weight and and feel of the watch. Although, maybe the model with the black face would have been a better choice."
2,Broke in less than 30 days,"The watch feels nice. Fit my wrist well and looked good. Unfortunately, the chronograph on this watch is not built as durably as the rest, and it failed on me. Luckily, this was fast enough for me to get my money back. If you think you will be using the arm that the watch is on to do things, I wouldn't buy this watch."
4,Big and beautiful but not for SCUBA,"I've owned this watch for about two years. I think it's really good looking watch but be forewarned, it is very large and heavy. I have a few G-Shock watches which aren't small either but the Calibre 2100 is a lot bigger. I'm not a small person and this watch dwarfs my wrist and in my opinion looks too audacious to wear as a dress watch. I get a lot of ""that's a really big watch"" comments.I gave the watch 4 stars instead of 5 because, for one, I really like how it looks but I wish it were a bit smaller. The second reason I gave it 4 stars is that the manual specifically says not to take it scuba diving. What the heck? The recreational limit for scuba diving is 40 meters, one fifth the 200 meters this watch is supposedly water resistant to. What exactly does water resistant to 200 meters mean and how deep can you safely take this watch? The world may never know."
3,Late Rossini,"Rossini's opera might well have been a knee-slapper at its first performances, but this kind of vaudeville seems quaint today. If you can bring a loose, indulgent attitude to the work, it is pleasantly amusing. This production probably does the piece as well as it deserves. Musically, of course, Rossini recycles much of the music of an opera he had written that he was convinced would never circulate (The Trip to Reins) with great skill; it is here very well performed."
5,Choosing your own path...sometimes not so easy!,"I thought Many Roads to Travel was a wonderful book. It picks up right where True Colours ends. The four main characters in this book have their own path they must walk. In some ways each of them is forced into walking a path that they may not have chosen all on their own. TJ, Mare, Erin, and Paula are all strong characters and they are made stronger by their friendship and love for each other. They are all wonderful and inspiring in there own right. This book is a very easy and pleasurable read. The authors write well together and create a great plot throughout this book. I would highly recommend it. It is a truly romantic book with many different versions of love running through it!"
3,"Paper is not ""glossy"" as listed on product specifications","Paper is not glossy as listed on the specifications. The glossy paper is needed for higher quality map print jobs. The order did come quickly, and the product can still be used on this end, however it was not exactly what was listed on the webpage."
5,Our favorite,"The best kids album. Songs in tune, you can understand the lyrics. The whole family loves it."
2,About what you'd hear in an elementary school,"Since there were no online samples of this set, I bought it on the basis of the other reviews. I am very disappointed. The singers do not have trained voices and the arrangements are frequently minimal, such as you'd hear at a school holiday concert. The ""preciousness"" factor is high (i.e. many adults will be gagging long before the end of the first two discs, much less all three).I plan to sell this and buy something--anything--else for my sons."
2,Not a good reference or text book,"I am a new SolidWorks professional who took a SoldWorks summer course at a four year college. We worked through the chapters of this book for 7 weeks. Quite a few students struggled trying to use and follow the text. The instructor was great.I wish the instructor did not use this book...The tutorials in the book were not very useful and were filled with mistakes. I have over 15 years of industry design experience. I had trouble obtaining access and information from his, ""SHAM"" website on the advanced chapters.I would not suggest this book. This is not a good reference text."
2,A door stop at 800 pages plus,"A great door stop. 800 pages plus and still counting. The book is very confusing to the new user. I guess the Advance user would understand the reason why the author shifts from topic to topic without any great clarification. There are numerous tutorials in the book, but I also found numerous mistakes, typos and areas that just ended without any explanations.I do not think that this book is a step-by-step book. If it is, he missed every other step for a new user. I found more help on the SolidWorks Website.The author did use a number of figures in the book to illustrate this ideas, but again it was not sufficient for the new user. I have been using SolidWorks for three months, and the books is now sitting on the floor under my desk so it will not take up any value space on my book shelf in my office."
5,Must for industrial professionals,"I am a Project Manager (CAD) in one of the leading CAD service providing company in Arkansas. Recently we hired a new team of young technical guys as CAD trainees. The challenge was to make these guys perfect in using SolidWorks in the shortest span of time, so that they could help us in working on the projects related to SolidWorks.I just come across the book SolidWorks for Designers by Sham Tickoo. This text really helped my guys a lot to learn SolidWorks from basic to advance and also it given all the shortest ways in the form of tips and tricks to land up on the required solution. I personally recommend this book to all the industrial professional and the training departments that are really looking for a good reference material on SolidWorks."
5,A good deal for industrial professioanls,"I work for a CAD solution providing company in San Francisco. The training department of our company is using the books authored by Sham since a long time. Our company conduct the training sessions of our engineers from time to time to update them on the latest CAD/CAM technology. We are also using his book on SolidWorks and our training department has recommended this book to all our engineers who have attended the updating session on SolidWorks 2003.The best part of this book is the chapters on the advanced topics that are available for free download. These advanced chapters include sheet metal design, mold design and so on, which is the lifeline of industry these days. To sum it up me and the training department of our company highly recommends this book."
2,bowtie,"Let's face it, this is not a true instruction video. It's eye-candy. I believe CustomFlix has 2 of these on the market. The Amanda version of Yoga is far better. Thuis video has Alicia who is plain at best. And to inhibited."
3,Title says it all,"Look at the cover and read the title: what is suggest is just what it is.Make no mistake, the excercises that you can view and then do yourself look (and are) at first easy but are progeressively demanding. The training objects used are household things. The nudity is functional, you can observe the leg, arm body positions very good this way. It helps also that all of this is demonstrated in a pleasant way, the lady likes what she is doing ! So, don't just buy and view this, get out of your chair and go at it !"
3,too fast,The video is only okay. If you want to follow along with the poses it's too fast. If you're just interested in seeing a nude woman there are better venues.
5,Feed & Toss,"Found these clearanced at PetSmart a while back, unfortunately because they're probably discontinued and going to become harder to come by in the future. Great idea for traveling because you don't have to wash bowl on the road if you don't want to, you can just toss them. They're dishwasher safe, though, to an extent, so I've made them last to be a little ""greener""."
4,Lovely,"This book is great to review Maggie Taylor's work. It does not explain how she puts together her images, which is what I was expecting. We were required to order this book for class to help us get inspiration for Photoshop. Her work is awesome and defiantly inspiring."
5,If you liked this...,"This is a fantastic book and, as other reviewers have stated, is its only 'fault' is that the how-to sections are a bit on the vague side. If you love Photoshop collage Maggie is the master, and you can learn an awful lot just by observing the detail of her work.Also worth a look isCut It Outby the wonderful Lou Beach, which, although not a how-to guide is a fantastic collection of collage work."
5,Essential for Photoshop Artists,This book is essential for Photoshop artists looking for an illustrative compendium of surrealistic color imagery one may achieve in Photoshop. The color reproductions are impeccable and each picture has background information by the artist herself. If you like Max Ernst's 100 Headless Woman you'll love this book. Her color sense and use of texture will make you really be hypnotised by her narrative creations. It can stand on its own as a picture book- as a manual you can apply yourself and delve into it even more.
1,Save your money,"I used to appreciate Taylor's work because of those almost inert portraits, until I read that the only thing she does is buying old portraits on ebay or flea markets to scan them and add color and other stuff to create their ""surreal"" images, so I think today's critics really don't care much and celebrate almost everything even when is not an original work.Besides that, the first half of the book is dedicated to interviewing a dozen of taylor's fans -including her husband- who leaves clear statement of how a great artist she is, and the second part features her work with maybe 3 examples of how she did them, in a very superficial way.If you get this book based on the title, you will be very very disappointed, even more if you really think in what some people call 'art""."
4,Beautiful to look at,"This is a beautiful book, with lovely pictures of Talyor's work. My only complaint is that ""Master Class"" is a bit misleading. Although I learned a lot about Ms Taylor, I hoped to learn a bit more of technique. I am still very glad that I purchased it, though. Her pictures are fascinating."
4,When journalism was a respectable profession,"Befroe the time of tabiod news, there was a man who felt that journalism should be taught in college so that the people who entered the field knew what they were doing. From that beginning at the University of Missouri, many other colleges have gone on to teach journalism. But it took the work of one man who believed that journalism was a respeceted profession to make the rest of the world to believe that too. A fascinating read about Walter Williams and how the School of Journalism came to be at one university and changed the way journalist were thought of."
5,"Excellent product, good service","This headphones are great! You have to be in the infrared area to get your signal, but if you are aware of this and eventhough decide to buy them, you will get an excelent product.Seller works fine, quick and serious people."
4,Cordless Headphones OK,They work well as long as you stay in line of sight of the transmitter. You cannot walk around with them. For this price they do what they are supposed to do.
3,Great for TV but not moving around the house,I purchased these headphones for the television and I have no complaints with stationary listening. But if you try to move around the house they are filled with static.
3,Not what we expected.,Probably our fault for not thoroughly reading packaging description; but this only works in the same room as the entertainment unit. Not what we were hoping for; however we kept it--too much of a hassle to bother returning.
1,save your money,"This is a five-minute video which is one of a series of ten. Since I didn't purchase the entire set (and who could at these prices), this video had limited use for me. If you're willing to shell out the bucks for the entire set, then the information in this snippet would probably make sense. Otherwise, save your money"
2,Way out dated,okay i got this camra for my girlfriend for christmas and i thought it was going to be a good one for her just to take silly pictures with her friends. i does take OKAY pictures but what the heck it wont take a memory card more than 1gb??? i got her a 4 and it wont even work with it and let me tell you tec support dosent give a hoot i wouldnt get anouther mustek go with a better brand
3,Fair Car Solution for iPod,"I got this FM transmitter after trying the iRoc for several weeks and being unsatisfied with it. First, the range of FM channels is much greater than the iRoc I had (which only gave four presetting channels.) This way you can tune incrementally to find the perfectly clear channel for best reception. While this is very nice, I live in Dallas where radio signals fill the dial and make reception poor to worse. On a long road trip I found that you had to constantly tune the thing as you passed in and out of towns due to radio interference. The best option is for hooking my MP3 player to any cheap radio at work or in various rooms at home so I can immediately have 10gigs of music from my iPod available. This way, in the home or office, you can find the perfect channel and interference doesn't change much so you can get things perfect. For the car, I may be too picky for a FM transmitter and might have to get a better stereo with a direct jack."
3,Owned and operating,"I bought this item and so far it's not bad, but it would have been nice if it had a greater range and was more powerful so that the Autoscan feature of the in car radio would auto detect it.... (or could it be the nissan sentra p.o.s. stock radio?)"
4,Good price for above average sounding headphones,"For the price they sound great but the construction could be stronger. They are hot around 600m-1k but otherwise they are rated from 20-20,000mhz and seem to do an accurate job of representing those frequencies. They also come with a pair of earbuds, overall good product at a good price."
2,"Basic headphones, not that great.",These hedphones were uncomfortable and lacked great sound quality. I'd recommend spending a little more to get something better.
2,Not worth the money,I was very disappointed with this video. Not much fishing action. Too much snow skiing action. Nothing about what kind of tackle or flies they were using. Amateurish at best.
5,Exactly what I needed,"I have a mini van and had replaced my front wipers and realized I needed the back one, too, so I ordered it on Amazon. It was exactly the same item that I purchased locally. I really like the winter blades because they don't ice up - important when you live where you get a lot of snow. Good quality wiper blade."
2,"Streaky, smears, stay away.",I'm really not happy with this wiper. I don't know if it's crappy design by ANCO or crappy old rubber that's been sitting on Amazon shelves for too long... but this thing smears every time we use them - on both vehicles. I'm going with another brand next time.
2,Does not fit correctly,I selected this wiper for my 2005 Dodge Caravan rear wiper. Amazon said this fit my van. It is the right size and the wiper would probably work for the right vehicle but it does not make contact over the whole rear window on the dodge. The rear hatch has a curved glass and both ends of the wiper does not touch the glass.

4,Find the Bride Finder!,"Susan Carroll spins a captivating story. She dangles questions masterfully in a plot that will keep one turning the pages, letting you know just enough until the chilling finale. The Bride Finder is haunting love story that has a thread of magic woven in; rather like Cinderella for grown-ups."
3,"Brilliant writing, but sterotypical","Ms. Carroll has a gift -- there is no doubt about that. Her writing is rich, intruiging, and very satisfying. This book, however, is painfully sterotypical: the dark brooding lord, handsome but scarred, the headstrong heroine, and the forbidden castle are the stuff of every fairytale and romance novel. It made the book quite predictable in spite of the magic and interesting lore woven in."
5,"A wonderful combination of love, legends, and laughter.","Susan Carroll really knows how to make characters you find it easy to laugh with, cry for, and even at times want to strangle. I love reading and it is so fun to find a book that totally enfolds you in its story and characters. I was sad to have the book end and say good bye to Anatole, Madeline, and the pesky Prospero. You can't imagine my joy to find out there was a sequel! (The Night Drifter)"
5,HOOKED FROM BEGINNING TO END.,"I EXTREMELY ENJOYED THE BRIDE FINDER. THE SUSPENSE, ADVENTURE, MAGIC AND MOST OF ALL THE UNDENIEABLE LOVE HAD ME TURNING THE PAGES. I WAS VERY HEARTBROKEN WHEN I WAS NEARING THE END TO KNOW THAT THE STORY WOULD NOT GO ON. THEN, TO MY RELIEF THERE IS A SEQUEL. THIS WAS MY VERY FIRST SUSAN CAROLL BOOK AND BECAUSE OF THE PURE GENIUS BEHIND IT, I WILL DEFINITELY BE LOOKING FORWARD TO HER FUTURE WORK."
5,Will leave you sighing from its romantic perfection!,"Oh my goodness. I don't know how I missed reading this book when it first came out but I was sure sorry I had! This book is just breath-takingly romantic. The paranormal aspect is wonderful, creating a hero who will steal your heart. Anatole is tortured and aloof, not wanting anything to do with the ""Lady of Flame"" who arrives as his bride. Madeline stands up to him however and totally melts his heart. A perfect romance! I loved it! :->"
3,"Interesting, readable, but lukewarm romance","I found the heroine to be inconsistent in her personality, wavering in her loyalties, and quite flimsy. The stilted marriage and romance was very frustrating to read, they could barely talk to each other, and this was ridiculous. Overall the plot was interesting, but I did not find the romance itself at all compelling. I didn't get the sense of true love found. I actually found my sympaties lying with Roman and the Mortmains!"
3,Not enough for me,"I devoured the first part of this book, desperately trying to get to ""the good stuff"". When it came I was blissfully happy, especially to find the long-awaited sex scene (the good one) exceeded my expectations. But, then the rest of the book just paled in comparison.Just as I was beginning the think the leading lady was finally going to redeem herself and show her worth as a chosen bride, she fails. Again and again. I really need my leading lady to be strong and an equal to her alpha-male mate.This story was such a let-down. I only gave it a 3 because I was so swept away by the love scene. I quit reading 50 pages before the end because I just felt it wasn't worth it any more."
4,Pretty darned good!,"What a relief to finally find someone who can not only plot well, but has a fine hand for writing and characterization as well -- in the romance genre, no less! I'd been through ten romance books in the past few months and was astonished at the mere fact that such garbage had gotten printed, but here comes this book to reaffirm my faith in the genre. Sure, there are a few cliches, but even those are well-written. I would have appreciated a toning down of the hero (who fits the typical romance mold), but the heroine was refreshing and not the totally-liberated woman that you so often find in historicals. The author even handled the sex scenes with penache, a rarity. I will certainly be keeping an eye out for more of Ms. Carroll's work!"
2,NOT EVEN CLOSE TO MS. CARROLL'S BEST WORK,"I have enjoyed Susan Carroll's regencies for years, and I was led to believe that THE BRIDE FINDER would be every bit as delightful. I was disappointed. While there are characteristic bits of Ms. Carroll's humor to be found now and then, neither the characters nor the plot sparkles like some of her best work. I was frankly bored. I kept hoping . . . and hoping . . . but finally I realized that there is a lot of froth here, but not much substance. Even Cornwall didn't feel like Cornwall, sorry to say. My advice, go buy a reprint of one of her regencies. You'll have a better read."
5,Fantastic,"I got the chance to work with this hardware throughout my High School band years when we bought a Taye 9 piece drumset. So as u might imagine we had to buy an estimate of 4 clamps, and i gotta say: THEY ARE FANTASTIC! Theyre sturdy and clamp very well to any known stand. If u need an inexpensive that works unimaginably well, these are the one for you!"
4,A Golfer's Life,"Although this book is several years old, it is still a great read of a uniquely American icon, full of interesting stories and insights!"
4,AP - A Golfer's Life,"Already reviewed this book and purchase. But, to repeat, I felt price for a used book was very good. Also, got here promptly. Very good transaction. Thanks again."
3,"Arnie, Warts and All","This is really Arnie! Loveable as he is, a psychiatrist would have a field day with this one. Arnie trys so hard to please his stern father. Shades of Rocket Boys! He also is a champion name dropper. While he is proud to think of himself as a blue collar person, one doesn't ever see him associating with those folks.It does get tiresome after awhile, having Arnie's soul bared so often. I hope it was cathartic for him. He discusses his relationship with Jack Nicklous across many pages. I would have preferred to have him admit that Jack is the greatest golfer of all time. I don't think Arnie could do that, as he still thinks he can be that person. A much more complicated person revealed here than you would think. An interesting and valuable book."
2,Legend of the 8 reasons not to buy this movie.,"If you are a real hard core Sonny Chiba Collector, then this is not worth your time, because he doesn't do really anything in this flick! Why is it not in widescreen? Why is there no original language track? This is DVD right? If you still want this movie to fill the gap in your Chiba collection try to find it in its original format & quality."
2,Need to be remaster,"Definetely it is a great classic samurai flick. So, it needs to be remastered to keep it valuable. Sounds effect are poor."
3,bad quality,"foolish story, horrible quality, hilarius sets. I like it and own it. If you like cheesy movies, you might like this. It's like a fantasy/martial arts movie, that you would be embarrased of watching if someone came in and found you watching it."
1,Not great!,"This film is about a Japense princess who escapes from her clan rivals, who mets up with bunch of samuri's who tries to protect her from the bad people. The kid from the movie Reincarnation of the Samuri is in this film. He was aful in that film and he is aful in this film. This movie has some very bad acting in it, and the actions in this movie was not very impressive. Only interesting character in this movie was the Rival dark prince who was very into taking females skin and use it as his own skin. You do not see this actually happing, though, you just hear him talk about it."
2,Very silly,"Legend of the Eight Samurai is just as bad as you'd think it should be. The plot bounces around in a most confusing fashion, but who cares about what's going on, anyway? The word Samurai is interchanged with Ninja in this story. The cast includes such characters as The Princess, Necktie Ninja, pantsless Samurai, unloved lady ninja, Elvis Samurai, The Evil Queen, the old lady who tears her own face off, and a bevy of poisonous women. Throw in tentacles and glowing blue balls, and the MST3K-style jokes happen all on their own. For ease of comprehension, all you need to remember is that the way of the Samurai is death, and expect a final deathcount of Shakespearian proportions."
3,wonderful visuals butthe Japanese script was better,"I first saw this film in the original Japanese as ""Satomi Hakenden."" I was not disappointed in the visuals but I couldn't help cringing at the awful American ""translation."" They got the basic idea right but the language they chose took a powerful coming of age story and made it sound ridiculous. If you can't get the original, get this just for the visuals and play it with the sound turned down."
2,What's Up with the Cover Photo!!???,"Does anyone know why a scene of Toshiro Mifune as Musashi in ""Samurai Trilogy"" is on the cover of this DVD!??"
3,Would have been better to seen the subtitle version.,The dub is pretty bad. A subtitled version would have been better.
3,comfortable but not supportive,The shoe fits well. It is not a good walking shoe as it offers no support. I am very concerned about turning my foot.
4,"good price, light weight jacket",I got this jacket when it was $50. I was very impressed at the quality and i like how it's waterproof so i can just walk in the rain with it. Great jacket and i think i will be wearing it for a long time!
2,A devastating disapointment,"The cinematography is awful. This film probably cost $100 to make and was filmed on a home camcorder. The one good thing about the film is the Nate, the beautiful, ripped army hunk marine.Shame he falls in love with a little gay goth who wears eye liner. The only good thing in the film was ruined when the goth paints his new army hunk boyfriend's eyes with eyeliner. Someone who was involved in the film is clearly into wearing eyeliner, and has put his style and stamp into the movie and in doing so ruined the one good thing about it.I'm off to buy some eyeliner now - i've been converted!!! GAYS FOR EYELINER!!"
2,"Nice idea, poorly executed.","I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this movie. That's sad, because I'm sure everyone had good intentions, and the whole thing could be remade anytime in the future with better quality. I don't want to criticize anyone or any function in the movie in particular. I'd say watch it if you can, however, in case it isn't just my opinion. I do wish them well."
1,Aimless and Boring,"This movie is one of the worst I've seen recently. It's boring, the story itself aimless, and the acting atrocious. The only good things about the movie are the songs and the full frontal nudity. Other than that, a waste of time.Don't buy this."
2,disappointed,The movie didn't go far enough. Too many flashbacks that seemed pointless. The acting was questionable at best.
2,rent. definitely.,"I rented this rather than bought it, and personally I'm glad I did. It's a good film - the camera shots are very persuasive and give themselves over to feeling more in touch with the characters. But the plot was lacking in development and I thought that there was much room for improvement in it."
2,Gloomy Guses,"Two very different men, a marine in search of his father and a gay Goth, embark on a road journey to find themselves. The film attempts to explore a variety of issues including parent/sibling relationships, responsibilities in life and a thin gay romance that seems to be thrown in for good measure. This morose film never really gets off the ground and the characters simply do not click. A film like this needs viewer empathy to care about the characters plight but they only come across as flat and uninteresting. It is hard to tell if the lead characters are suffering from severe mental depression or just plain stupdity (they both do a lot of dumb things in the film). The only thing I did like about 'Dog Tags' was the acting, which is very good. It is not enough to save this film which is about as exciting as watching paint dry."
3,Dog Tags Movie,It was an okay movie. Can't say much about it without ruining it. But I happened to enjoy it.
1,Don't bother,Was looking forward to this after reading all the reviews but in one word - disaster - don't waste your money
2,Slow,"You keep washing that something will be happening and you keep waiting until the end, to slow and not to good acting"
2,Save Your Money,"I was very disappointed when I bought this film. I bought it because there seemed to be so much hype about it. Well, to me, that's all it was: HYPE. The guy on the cover is gorgeous. However, and as usual with most gay movies, it didn't end happily ever after. I wish I had seen a preview of it before purchasing it....because I would've kept my hard earned dollars in my pocket."
1,I WASTED MY MONEY,"This is the worst gay movie I've EVER seen. It is boring, poorly shot, and the storyline could have been written by a 5th grader. [...]."
5,Here are the tracks on this Karaoke sing-along tape.,Ain't Got Nothing If You Ain't Got Love (Michael Bolton)Wild Night (John Mellencamp & Me'shell Ndege'ocello)Here Comes A Man (Traffic)Hard Luck Woman (Garth Brooks)Includes easy-to-read lyrics and demonstration vocal. Not recorded by original artists.
1,What a waste of time,"I bought this video for my teenage son, who really enjoyed the original On Any Sunday video. We were looking for more entertaining video about the thrill of riding motorcyles. However, this was a bomb. It was just more of the same footage that was in the original movie, with old timers reminiscing about what it was all about back then. I wonder why the producer thought anyone would want to watch more of the same video footage on this new tape? I'm really upset that I wasted my money on this. I should have just got something from a new producer. These people are beating the ""On Any Sunday"" horse to death."
3,On Any Sunday Revisited.,"It is just a lot of interviews and reminiscences about the original On Any Sunday,The Riders themselves and Bruce Brown as well."
5,Who's the Kid on the Bike in the Credits?,"Love the original. Anyone know who's the blond boy on the bike, popping a wheelie all down the road?"
5,GREAT TO KEEP TRACK OF OLD PALS,"FOUND THIS DVD TO BE VERY, VERY INFORMATIVE AND BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF OLD MEMORIES. DIDN'T MISS A MINUTE OF IT.WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE TOUCHING BASE WITH SOME OF THE LEGENDS OF THAT ERA SUCH AS RICE, ROMERO, MARKLE. WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?OVERALL IT WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH."
4,Watch on any day,"I remember watching this and the origional On any Sunday years ago. It is much better than some of the newer bike videos, which go over the top and get a bit dull. This video has lots of variety and does not get boring.....far from it!Watch this, it is great"
3,"Dreadful cover, cardboard characters--yuuuch!","OK, I give credit for writing a racy, sexy novel because--some days we could all use some fantasy. BUT let's put a little more effort into minor writing details like knowing someone for more than--say--2 hrs before having a full-on carnal festival of delights. I mean how about something romantic like--last names?? First names?? Granted everyone's an adult but there is not enough information about these characters for me to care about and the rest of the story plays like a cheap porn flick--3-6 ppgs and another racy sequence. Plus the cover is a negative attention-getter and if you try and fold back the illustration so you could actually read the book around other humans--the glue and paper are so cheap the binding came off and pages fell out. What a waste of time, $$$ and effort!"
1,There is a bit of a price discrepancy,If you look at the second page of the book preview it has a price of 7.99. So I would say $80 is a bit of a rip off!
2,My dog turned into a Shoggoth,Yes I wrote bought the book with laughing at it because bad but then my dog became shoggoth-sog so I will think maybe its true also up without seventeen clams not like supertology
1,"This is a joke, don't buy this book",OK I got had and bought this piece of crap. It is totally someone's created immagination and not based on substance. I like to read on the occult and this is fantasy and fiction. Save your money and don't buy this!
2,"Serious Satanists don't read crap, this is crap!","Who could ever believe in what the Necronomicon is, or at least, what it is suppose to be? This book only presents the delirium of an addict and stressful sad person. No truly satanist could read this and believe than even a page of it is true!!!This kind of crap is the result of a lot of cocaine and alcohol, the loss of his son, the downward spiral of his life. I gave it a 2 because he at least took the time to invent a history and it is kind of ""spooky"" and could be entertaining at some point. But if I really want to read fiction, I would buy under fiction. And if I'm going to buy fiction under religion, I would buy the holy bible, it is kind of historic too."
1,Been here done that -,"Blah, Blah, Blah -Make up names, burn the sacred grass in a bowl, forge the silver on the exact night as the bear hangs from its tail in the sky, draw the circle of flour etc, etc, etc...And all that you see before you will simply be the emancipations of your own intellect.Deal with it; no book necessary; not this one or any other."
5,None More Black,"The authenticity of the Necronomicon is still an open question. As I cannot claim expertise in the ancient occult grimmoire, I can't really judge the authenticity of the work. I will say that the book is intriguing enough for me to have read some 20 years ago, and then have my interest in it re-awakened after broad reading in Western Ceremonial Magick, Crowley, Golden Dawn, John Dee Enochian, Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism, and Zen, not to mention background heavy metal, Metallica, various Black Metal bands, and the Lovecraft and R.H. Howard works. Whether a well constructed hoax, a popularized artifact, or the genuine article, the Necronomicon is indeed among the black foundation stones of the darker side of popular culture, and should be read even if for background and familiarity."
3,My belief of the weight of the truth of this book,"my belief is that this book may or may not be a work of fiction but truthfully, i don't think it matters. whereas everything we percieve is simply that (personal perception) i feel that, fictitious or not, if this book works moderately well for you, great!!! it is not a matter of where the book came from, but if it can convince you enough that it works, to work."
1,THIS is THE TRUTH,"Lovecraft NEVER Wrote or found nothing about this. He invented it, but he never wrote it. It is just an imaginary book that he used as a reference in his tales, but it never existed, so anything you find like ""Necronomicon, by H.P. Lovecraft"" (this same book is sold in mexico under the name of Lovecratf) is a fake,hoax, a garbage.Anyone who thinks the spells really work, is being FOOLED. Any version of any autor claiming it is real or transcripted from an antique text is FAKE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE LONG REVIEWS, THIS IS THE RESUME:NECRONOMICON DOESN'T EXIST."
3,An amusing story...,"If you're interested in the history of the book, one very well-written version is at ... [website] I'm trying to ascertain just how well-researched it was, but it's numerous references to actual historical figures and dates makes it worth investigating. To sum up why Lovecraft was not aware of its existence (according to the document I just mentioned), he had a lover named Sonia Greene in 1921 who had also consorted with none other than Aleister Crowley. His first mention of the book during that year, coupled with many parallels in Crowley's work (parallel not only to the content of this book but also with Christian, Norse, and Jewish mythology) indicates that this volume was not merely a flight of fancy."
4,Enter at your own risk!!,"I've read the book many times over, I believe that there a things that should be researched befor endevering to TRY the incantions. They, to me, have validity. I do not recomend the novice delve into the grey area that surounds the mysteries of rites untill they have at least ""done there homework"". If you enjoy the read it's OK, but as stated in the forward strange things seam to... follow this book in all aspects. I hope you enjoy your purchace??? older than you think.. trixter4all"
2,Essay Was The Best Part,"It looks like HPL has become a wholesale hoaxer of modern-day Satanists everywhere! If you're in doubt, please read ""Lovecraft At Last"" by Willis Conover. In that book, Lovecraft admits to one of his correspondents that the Necronomicon was a made-up book. Still, Lovecraft's fiction was so powerful that they were able to conjure a non-existent book into existence! The seals and sigils and spells in the book are rather comical to anyone who knows much of the history of magic in the west, but the essay at the beginning of the book is rather interesting, though unconvincing. the author tries to relate ancient Sumer with Aleister Crowley with H.P. Lovecraft. I think it is this introductory essay which has given the book so much of it's appeal. Anyway, of you are a fan of Lovecraft's prose, as I am, then this might be an amusing way to kill a few hours."
4,"Bow Before Me, For I Possess The Power Of The Necronomicon","First off, no one can be sure if some prick just made up all this stuff or not. First off, the real Necronomicon, if one exists, is lost and only one person has ever seen it. So to buy this book and believe the stuff in it you have to out of your mind. However if you are enthralled in the occult and/or Lovecraft's works, get this just to see how cryptic and interesting it is. It may not hold the powers of the universe in it, but it makes for a great read."
2,Thousands of explorers sought it - now it's a $5 PAPERBACK,"First and foremost, I'm a Lovecraft fan. I also dabble in pagan circles - but I keep the two subjects very much in their own backyards and don't let them play together. Why is this ""eldritch paperback"" on my shelf? Not for magical use, that's for sure - it's a work of fiction, written to make a buck. It ain't gonna open no freakin' portal to the Great Old Ones in the Cyclopean Sunken City of Ry'leh.BUT, it's a nice conversation piece with nifty pseudo-cabalistic symbols and diagrams. Ooh, and a cool BLACK cover with an arcane symbol on it. (Just great for all you Marylin Manson teenyboppers to leave out for your parents to see...)For $5, it's a cute book to keep on your Lovecraft fiction shelf. That's the FICTION shelf, GOT IT?"
4,intresting from all sides,"Whether you take the contents of this Necronomicon seriously as magickal instructions or not - it still has a ''practical'' value because it is about something that concerns us all, and lies deep within: our primal fears. This book challenges the reader to face his or hers, demons and monsters, and control them, rather than vice versa. (Demons and monsters can be viewed as ''Character-flaws'') To me, the message of this book is simply this: Conquer your own darkest (primal) fears.This book has a message, and I think that every one should read it and give it a good thought - whether they practive magick or not - the Necronomicon is much much more than simply one more grimore - and after some background study of the mythology-system of the book - you will be much richer in spirit..."
3,Necronomicon,"I had heard a lot about this book so was kind of expecting a little more I suppose ,but it wasn't bad .Looking in to more books about the ancient ones."
4,A misunderstood book.....,"This book is not a gate way of evil, nor a devil worshiping hand book. I have read through it many times and have found that it is a hand book on how to invoke the Elder gods, and other spirits to help you in your life and to keep the ancient ones, who are evil(if you follow this ""religon""). And how to prevent these evil ones from accessing earth. Of course wheather you think this is real or a short story it is very entertaining, and puts many things in your life in perspective. Buy it or borrow it, just read it."
1,How'd this get on the Wicca shelf?,This book is the nauseating monitary exploitation of a Lovecraft invention....it has no magickal merit and is totally unrelated to Wicca and it's tenents
3,Read the book,"The point of a book is not whether its true, how old it is, or if it summons demons. The point is good reading. For those people writing reviews, please read the book themselves (like you, ravensmask) before telling everyone not to read it. I don't care if you are a real witch or a necromancer, or a dungeons and dragons geek, read the book if you want it was at least decent reading and dont let people tell you not to just because they have personal biases against it or make up stories to convince you not to. If you think you want to read this, dont let others dissuade you. This is probably something you would find interesting."
5,Wow!,"If this book is real, I can not put into words the experience of the mad Arab. His experience is unimaginably over my head."
2,Entertaining at least,"While at a freind's home, I picked up his copy of this ""book"" (if you choose to call it that - it qualifies only by the fact that it's bound full of written pages). After reading three random pages, I inquired as to why it hadn't been put to better use in starting a fire, becuase in all truth, a fire is the only thing you'll be able to summon useing this. While it is entertaining, don't get your hopes up that demons will start flying around the room. De Furtivis Literarum Notis (as suggested above, among other works) is a much more practical book to purchase if you're interested in finding a more serious view on the topic."
3,The Truth,"I have done some research on the Necronomicon, and found out that it was invented by Lovecraft himself. Although some people truly believe that the book really existed, and that Lovecraft only tried to keep the secret save by saying that he had written it himself, the book DID NOT EXIST. It has sprouted from a man's rich imagination, and began to live a life of its own. If you do not believe me, search the internet, go to the library, or contact the British Museum (who (according to Lovecraft) should have a copy), and find out for yourself."
3,who knows?,"Is this the real necronomicon? does it matter? UncleAl Crowley wrote about a occultist who lost his text and simply sang ""greenlands icy mountains"" and obtaines his results!this is one of those books that would look better in a large ,leather bound format,but some how it would lose a lot of its power.there is something about the banality of the small paperback edition,from AVON NO LESS! The idea that you can buy a bottle of cheap rank perfume for your maiden aunt Squint,and a ""UNSPEAKABLE TOME"" at the same location,just has a charm all it own! Lovecraft made the necronomicon seem more like a giant Talmud of occultism then a rather small grimore. As the say,this is the kind of thing you will like,if you like this kind of thing!"
2,You do realize,"Everyone here does realize that the necromonicon was a literary invention, that Lovecraft made it up right?...right?"
4,Some Corrections,This is a good book although incompleteThis book is not fiction for those who say that Lovecraft invented the Necronomicon do some research and you will find writtings about the Necronomicon that date back at least as far as the 18th century here are just a few titles for those who wish to checkLa Magie et la Divination chez les Chaldeo-Assyriennes;by LaurentScience Occult; La Magie chez les Chaldeens ; by Lenormantas you will see the last one was published in 1874 thus befor Lovecrafts birthJust a History lesson
4,"Not bad at all,...","I would use this more as a reference book to the ancient Sumerian/Chaldean system of ritual magick, and also a really good tool for pathworking/astral manipulations (for the more advanced practicioner) rather than an actual grimoire. Contains alot of interesting material, some of which could possibly be adaptable to modern times, but taking as this wasn't written by an actual adept/practicioner and contains no footnotes/reference notes/clear instructions on any of the ritual and summonings, I wouldn't really take the chance. Though I hear Donald Tyson will have an interesting 'Grimoire of the Necronomicon' out this August. Pre-order now."
3,This book is a fake...,It was thought up by H.P. Lovecraft and a few other horror writers to add a common basis for their stories. Think about it...the most secret of occult books now brought to you in paperback? Now that doesn't sound right...
3,"Guys, get a grip. No one involved in this book believed it.","People, relax. Nothing in this book is remotely true, partially true or even hoped to be true by anyone who had anything to do with the book being made. This is fiction dears. And that is what it is supposed to be! Fun! You know? Fun? A game? Yes, that is what it is, that is what Lovecraft wanted it to be and that is what the fine people who made this book are all about. Fun, horror fiction. Spells, incantations, it is all fiction. 100% for fun. So re-lax, okay? So buy it or dont buy it, but for crying out loud, dont buy into it."
2,Curio,"The Necronomicon is an interesting curio, and would make a nice addition to the library of any serious student of magic and the occult. However, it is more curious than any other grimoire I've perused, having it's roots mostly in fiction, more than other works. As a text or grimoire it is almost useless, but could perhaps shed some light on non-Judeo-Christian ritual magic."
3,interesting although not at all what it claims to be,"this book does contain some interesting historical facts in it, but the claim that it is the necronomicon is completely false considering H.P. Lovecraft invented the Necronomicon and it never existed. The claim that it was changed for the sake of safety--not to mention the whole tale of being given the manuscript by a reclusive occult shop owner, an overused cliche in this type of fiction-- may make it interesting and a bit more exciting, as it sort of involves the reader. However, in letters written by Lovecraft himself (and reprinted in various books), he describes how he came up with the name of the book AND of the ""mad arab"". And he makes it quite clear that the book does not exist, but was invented to add consistency to his own various mythos and story cycles."
2,"Entertaining, in parts...","...and thankfully most of us do recognise it's not ""real"", in as much as..well..it is a work of fiction.That said, it's quite entertaining in parts. I'd probably recommend you pick this one up at the library, rather than buy it. And..I hate to drum this message in a little more..but, ""folks, it's not factual. It's not real"".Enjoy!"
5,My Personal Review,This book is as true as it is said to be. The reality that people miss is that they do not use the book for anything. They simply read it and pass it off as a fake. It is not a fake as I have used it many times.
1,Simon's a fraud,"Simon is also known as Peter Levenda, and writes other slightly paranoid books with that name, has a website where research is done by linking names and events together and calling the distance between the two ""part of the conspiracy"".The man sees ghosts.Google ""Alan Cabal and THE DOOM THAT CAME TO CHELSEA"" and you'll get the honest story.Boo. Hiss."
1,Malicious hoax,"This book is a malicious hoax. If the magick in it works at all, it will just be to blow up in your face. The ""real"" Necronomicon was invented by H.P. Lovecraft in imitation of R.W. Chambers' The King In Yellow, a fictional tome that will drive anyone who reads it insane.For a nice Necronomicon that has the grace and manners to be honest about being a fake, try Donald Tyson's attempt. If you actually want to use the Cthulhu Mythos in your magickal pathworkings, try Phil Hine's Pseudonomicon. For more information on how atrocious Simon's fake is, read The Necronomicon Files by Harms & Gonce. For cosmic horror, read Lovecraft himself."
4,An Important Beginner's Manual,"Regardless of the origin of this book -- some say it is actually real, written by the ""Mad Arab"" a thousand years ago, while others argue that it is actually an uncredited work of H.P. Lovecraft -- it is still an interesting read.Indeed it does remind me of some of Lovecraft's works, along with some of the thoughts of one Aleister Crowley, but it would be unfair to say that this book really holds no mereit, or importance. If anything it is indeed more important than some other works of the Dark Arts, as it really gives a good example as to what to, and not to do amongst the use use of magic sources, and spirits. It is essentially a fictional beginner's manual that should be read by all whom appreciate the dark Arts, or are interested in becoming involved with them."
3,A lovely forgery. Why it still works.,It is true that this is not an ancient text but a modern forgery. It would be nearly impossible to convince practitioners of this. For surely results can be achieved with this ... tome.If you examine Chaldean Magick by Francis Lenormant London 1877 you will see the source for some of Simons spells. These ancient spells are still effective today even if in a fake book.Also one must consider that the Sumerian Gods are real and answer prayers. How do I know? I am a priest of Enki and Inanna.I hope that any who practice rituals from this book come to the truth that the power is not in the text it is in the minds of the users.Faith + will + ritual = magick
1,Disappointed,Not what i expected. It only briefly delved into the history of the book and barely referenced the actual book itself. Very disappointing.
3,Interesting as a collectable,"This is a hardcover reissue of the paperback by Simon that's been around since the sixties.Instead of incorporating quotes from the stories of Lovecraft himself (as some ""Necronomicons"" have done)it is a pastiche of Sumerian sorcery invocations and some creativity based on several shamanistic traditions.This not a real grimoire in itself, but as a piece of spooky movie memorabilia or as part of a sociological study of modern seekers after the outre it is of some interest.The book is of decent quality, but not nearly what one would expect for the price."
2,*Razzberry*,"This book is a rehash of a bunch of random myths. It can no more conjure up supernatural spirits than any other text. I have no clue whether it was written by Crowley, Lovecraft, Simon, some Satanist trying to drum up interest, or some Christian trying to throw a scare into people--and I really don't care. One way or another, it made little sense and was barely readable. I think that the only good thing that ever came out of this book was Mary Gentle's use of it as a source for orc names."
4,a great starter for all interested in this area,"when i first bought this book i was not a performer of dark rituals nor a scholar of lovecraft, but merely an interested kid. my friends and i found it, so i got it,i did not expect to be raising the dead and ivoking spirits.in short, i knew it was complete bull in regard to it's accuracy to ""the true necrinomicon"" (note the sarcasm). however what it did was entertainingly broaden my fascination with dark subjects. so if you're looking to chant spells and control Gods, this book is not for you because it is complete B.S. but if you just want to learn a little bit about sumerian religion and the ideas and stories behind the writings of the mad arab this book is a great informer to teach the basics"
3,The Intro is the book...,"The introductory Essay is the only part of this book that can be made any sense of unless you are experienced in this field. The essay is very interesting and thoughtful, but the remainder of the book consists of gibberish and redundant ""spells"" that are totally useless and meaningless. If you are interested in analysis of theology or the Sumerian Mythos, get this book for the intro-essay. If you have no experience with this, don't bother."
1,In response to Altatheria's review,"Is it not also unethical to reveal that you even met the alleged author of the Necromonicon, after being initiated into some alleged Thelemic group? What are the three laws of Magic?And, as with any magical text, take all with a grain of salt...."
5,Caal,"COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL COOL IT,s wrealy is!"
3,WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!,"This book is nothing more than PART of the history of mankind itself. If any of you were to actually do more reading into history and the origins of man, you would know that the first civilization (Sumer) ""worshiped"" ""gods"" that ""happen to have"" the same names as the ""mad arab"" Abdul Alhazred refers to. It astounds me how naive and gullible you people truly are. I doubt VERY serioulsy if we will EVER truly know the origins and history of mankind but, this book axplains some of where we came from and how ""crazy"" we as individuals can truly become. The next time any of you ""envokes"" any of the ""demons"" from the ""spells"" in this book, I suggest you ask them what there home world is and why they have chosen to not come back to earth and ""teach"" us as they did in the ancient times.If you want more proof, just do some research on the ""gods"" and dieties of ancient Sumer and the civilization itself. If you can't see the connection, then your all sadly blind.I bid you all Adieu."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!,"Okay, i bought this book a while ago and thought that just because the back said it was powerful and all, i should buy it. I had no idea about what the stuff was at first. I tried an invocation and a bluish in color spirit entered my friends body. I am not lying at all. So now we need to do some ritual to get it out and back to the lost soul plane. I burnt this book a couple days ago. I hope whoever buys this book knows that the ""Mad Arab"" was possessed by the devil and all these spells and such were created by someone who was the mad arab, the wierd possessed guy. The necromancy in this book isnt as good as Egyptian...."
5,Narrow minded non-believers,"To all those who think this book is a fake, or have tried spells and nothing happened, I got knews for you. This book is not complete. The actual invocation of astral projections whick allows you to contact these entities are written on pages which have been hidden in a monastery in Northern Italy. To this day is remains protected from foolish eyes. The rest of the original pages have been in the possession of a collector who lives in Maine. The book was written in the country now known as Iraq in which most people know is famous for the archeological finding of ancient demonic relics. The book though give a great history of the writer Abdul Alhazred (the mad Arab). and is great to read when seeking some form of enlightenment. But unlike other books out in the market, This one is REAL. I am still haunted by what I've conjured almost a decade ago. SO read this book to yourself and don't try any of the rituals. It is not worth the years of torment that follow."
5,demoncracy!,this book is the most evil book in the world! it was first writen in blood! it is the psyical embodiment of pure evil. it's spells were writen for evil purposess only! don't touch this book. ever! i also fear it.
1,Where's the Lovecraft?,Why do I sense Sumerian Myth with Lovecraftian thrown in to make it seem real. Either way I wasted money.
1,Exploitational hoax,"This book does not present accurate Sumerian magic. It does not present accurate Crowleian magick. Most importantly,it does not depict(and IS NOT)the(fictional)book that Lovecraft created. ""Simon""(and his publishers)have been exploiting HPL's creation for about 25 years. This book is BOGUS. Stand up to corporate plundering. Boycott this book."
1,"A note concerning the Lenormant, and Laurant connection","Given that ""Science Occult; La Magie chez les Chaldeens ; by Lenormant"" and ""La Magie et la Divination chez les Chaldeo-Assyriennes; by Laurent"" have been mentioned, be it known neither of the volumes mentioned record the word NECRONOMICON, nor any likeness. Only the publishers of the book make any connection, though the hoaxers were likely aware of these books, and kept them in mind during authorship."
1,Let's piss on H.P. Lovecraft's grave!,"Wow. Just wow. I saw some kid reading this thing at a bookstore and decided ""Hey, I like Lovecraft, I'll check this out."" So I walk over ot the shelf and flip through it. Not only is all the information in the book incorrect, it's a kick to HP's nuts. I mean it doesn't have very much to do with the Mythos cycle anyhow.Oh, and for you ""Chaos Magicians"", I recommend a good slap in the face. No, you can't cast magic. No, you don't know what a historical pagan is. No, your parents don't support your life style. Get a girl/boyfriend, a job, a life and for God's sake please stop being an idiot."
4,"live free, die well","what can be said about this book that has not already been spoken? I have studied this book for four years in combination with the Satanic Bible and although it is not precise in the third dimensional concepts it supposes, the book is very influential upon the real world. No one can, by magic or force of will, cause anything to happen that is not meant to happen, and it has been said many times before that nothing is meant to happen until it happens. So, to the would-be sorcerer and sorceress out there, as with anything else that mankind has poured its human faith into(with the exception of the bible), look at this book from an OBJECTIVE STANDPOINT. If you want tochange your life, change it by thought, words and sctions OF YOUROWN, not by witchcraft."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!,"people listen if you are buying this book for ""spells and magic"" be prepared to be highly disopinted this book trys to brainwash a reader to believeing that there are unspeakable horrors more powerful than satan lurk waiting in the void/abyss (another name for hell) untill the day that they shall return ( the ""old ones"") while this does throw the ocassional bit of sumerian myths into its pages (probably why i even bothered to read ANY of it) if you actually think this is real then do yourself a favor and go into a re hab clinic trust me you'll be doing yourself a favor"
3,Get a clue before buying this book,"The book is ok. I got it when I was 16 and now at the age of 18 I know better.Many people buy this book thinking that it will bring them great power and dominance over the universe and what not. Well they are NOT going to get it from this book unless they know the truths about magick and how the mind plays an important part. Those of you who know about collective consciousnes should know exactly what I'm talking about. So, for those who don't have a clue about the fundamentals of magick this book will be a total wast of time for you."
5,secrets of old NOT FOR THE WEAK MINDED,the necronomicon is real secrets of the old ways for those who are willing to read can effect those weak minded
1,Fools all of you,"Lets be honest here people. Howard Phillips Lovecraft INVENTED the necronomicon in September of 1922 as a literary tool to enrich several of his FICTIONAL works. This book is an obvious tactic to grift impressionable fools. If you'd like to believe that the power of the universe can be harnessed to your whim, then go right ahead, but don't waste your time on obvious hoaxes. If you'd like to read a few REAL titles instead of this poorly conceived abomination then I can recommend the following:Malleus Maleficarum and Compendium Maleficarum Francisco M. Guazzo;Ars Magna et Ultima, Raymond Lully;De Lapide Philosophico, Johannes Trithemius;Key of Wisdom, Artephius;Thesaurus Chemicus, Roger Bacon;Turba Philosophorum, Guglielmo Grataroli;De Furtivis Literarum Notis, Giovanni Battista della Porta;The Daemonolatreia, Remigius;Good luck finding them!"
2,Not to be toyed with...,"If you have any sense at all, heed this advice: avert your eyes from this work of evil. I once faltered into a dark age of my own soul and attempted some of these rituals in anger in the depths of my parents basement.It has since become a horrific place that I dare not go. I can hear the scraping and hissings of damned souls from my bedroom at night. I have to turn up my headphones all the way and let ""The Cure"" blot it out. I fear it will only get worse from here..What have I done?"
5,"A great read, but definatly fiction.....","The Necronomicon by Simon is a great read. It's facinating how the tome has taken a life of it's own, definitely helped by the rumors that flew to the ears of the curious back in the eighties and nineties. I was in junior high when friend who knew of my interest in things esoteric suggested the read to me, more as a horror novel than as a serious study in the arcane or spiritualist side of my personae. But I digress, while the magic words do smack of amateur horror fiction, it is still an interesting read none the less if not for any other reason than the way Simon merged the fiction of H.P. Lovecraft with the fact of Sumerian lore."
1,"Amusing, but not worth the price","A nice little tribute to Lovecraft's ""forbidden book"". The book by George Hay is much better, however. And anyone who takes the spells seriously should try reading Robert Chambers' ""A King In Yellow"" to see where Lovecraft got some of his ideas from."
3,Its not real you idiots,"The Necronomicon is the invention of writer H.P. Lovecraft who invented the character the ""mad arab"" Abdul Alhazred when he was a kid in Massachussets. The Necronomicon written by Abdul Alhazred features prominently in several of his works of horror FICTION. This Necronomicon is merely the invention of ""Simon"" to cash in on the bogus notoriety the book has among people who got their notions of the occult from reading Swamp Thing comic books and listening to Morbid Angel. Summerian my a$$. If praying to jesus or whomever doesn't get you what you want, why in the name of Azagthoth would you think that praying to Summerian gods or demons would get you anything either? except a headache. Go out and do something in the world yourself, cause you are going to get jack (...) by just thinking about it. The Necronomicon is a fun read if you realize the authors tongue was firmly in his cheek, but no person with any real interests in the occult takes this book even remotely seriously."
4,the only one out there,"The analog tuner drift keeps you having to tweak the dial, and at best, it's not much better than AM sound quality. Still, it's at least as good as the other FM transmitter I have experience with.Construction is cheap, and the unit is built to dangle from the cables. But the cables are cheap too, so they eventually wear out from fatigue. That's how mine died.However, much to my irritation, I cannot find a replacement with the essential DC output to power my trusty mp3 CD player. So here I am buying another one. Therefore, soundfeeder gets 4 stars and nobody else gets any.Product is ok if price and expectations are both low."
2,AM radio sound quality. Cheap build.,"Ordered on 3/12. Arrived on 3/14. The shipping is expensive ($5.57) but very impressive.The packaging is cheap and misfit. The wires come out like manggled spaghetti. The unit feels flimsy. It looks like it is bought from Dollar Tree or DollarRama.The power supply to the CD player works but the contact is extremely flaky. Any slightest move causes the CD player to turn off. And this is a parked car. Don't bother to use it in a moving car.The radio transimission is easy to setup but the frequency shifts. There is some static noise. The sound is at best AM radio quality, which is Ok for hard rock or other noisy music, but a little too poor for light music."
1,Didn't work for me.,I had a Soundfeeder and I threw it away and bought an irock. The irock works much better and is much better looking. The frequency dial on the Soundfeeder didn't lock on to a frequency on my radio and kept drifting all the time. I had to manually adjust it every 15 minutes or so. Not worth it if you have to fiddle with it all the time. I'm thinking about the iTrip from Griffin Technologies as my next purchase.
4,soundfeeder,if u need a low tech solution to listen to mp3 or dvd player for a car that isnt set up or wired for new technology this can help. it isnt perfect but is better than nothing.
4,Works great at a more than great price,"I cannot believe that I was able to get this FM transmitter for under five dollars, and it works great allowing me to listen on my car radio to podcasts and music from my PDA. Need to adjust the frequency from time to time, but easy to do, and the quality of sound is just fine."
2,B Grade TV series,"The acting is very B Grade, and that includes the Zombies. There are some good idea's that could have made this into a good TV series with the right budget and in the right hands.The good: The third episode based inside a hospital was the highlight, and actually watchable, just.The Bad: How many times can you miss hitting a Zombie standing in front of you, just one arm length away? And were did those bullets go? As for the Zombies, how much time do you need to bite someone, that is in you grip? Unfortunatly this makes the action to clumsy, and doesn't help the B grade acting."
3,lets begin,"this cheesey fun cheap amature excitment ,it,s so cornball fun it,s worth watching but i doubt it will have a devoted following."
1,I hope they hada big budget,"I love Zombie anything, yet this provided a D class movie. Very terrible acting. I have seen better and this would be on my why did I bother"
1,"OMG, Move the car Tony... blah blah blah","I knew this had to be something less than what it looked like and it was..! Such a disapointment.... Mothing in the way of acting or writing and terrible makeup.. repetative boring go nowhere senseless action that made no sense and simply wasted time, and the horrible east coast accents with no acting background... yuck.. ... kind of like my review of this.... why am I wasting my time...? to warn you... DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!"
4,Happy with it,"I had my doubts on this, but works pretty well. Have not figured out how to replace the pads yet though, and liquid is hard to drop just one or two drops - kind of gushes out."
2,You get what you pay for . . .,"I needed a cassette cleaner for my car stereo, and saw this cheap one and decided to give it a try. I've used it once and I don't really think it worked. The cassette looks cheaply made and I'm not sure the cleaning pads are touching the areas that need to be cleaned, since only one of them got SLIGHTLY dirty afer running it for about a minute. I'll probably try it again to see if I was screwing up, but I'm not holding out much hope."
4,clean your heads,"works terrific, .cassettes sound good again. Real handy for car units since the heads are usually hard to clean with swabs, they are usually out of reach unless you remove the unit and the cassette players cover.Highly recomended"
3,cleans OK,"Cleans well, but may not be sufficient for neglected cassette deck. I needed to clean the cassette in a 2004 350Z. Not sure how much it was ever used. Playing tapes or MP3 through converter had noise and crackling."
1,Do Not Buy This DVD (Universal is Lazy),"The VHS version of this film is 2 hours & 3 minutes. This version is 1 hour and 23 minutes. Universal cut a hugh part of this film out. Do NOT buy this version, make lazy universal release the FULL FILM on dvd."
5,a classic starring moses,a classic i never get tired of watching los angeles crumble..especially since i dont live there anymore ..shake away
4,When the ground is shaking,A super quake hits L.A. everyone goes for the elevaders! The first time I saw it was in 3-D! great cast too.
2,Don't buy this if you ever saw the REAL film,"The actual film runs 160 minutes. This film run 123 minutes. They cut out things like a person drowning in a dam elevator, BUT they left in all the reaction to the person (who now has never been referenced or referred to) who drown. If you have only seen this hacked up film, this and many more scene will make no sense. What is the point of cutting a DVD transfer when you have plenty of room to put the whole film there. The only possible answer is it costs less and they don't expect the DVD to sell well.It's interesting how they can pass any law that crosses their minds about what the users can do and not do with a film but they have no rules. They can release a 15 minute version if they want, just end credits and out credits and say that's the film. They can burn all copies in a bonfire and cook hotdogs. That needs to change. There needs to be a responsibility on the side of the owners as well."
3,"Great movie, terrible DVD package","This is one my favorite movies but Universal blew it again with the DVD transfer. They fail to realize the potential revenue that can be made from these classic films. The picture quality is pretty good for a 70's movie but the movie is still heavily edited from the original version. There are so many scenes missing I couldn't even begin to list them all. There are NO extras, not even a trailer! The DVD was so poorly authored there is not even an audio or chapter menu! The sensuuround audio track is way too low even with the subwoofers maxed out. Universal should have released a 2 disc version with all existing footage included. A very disappointing release from Universal"
1,PATHETIC! DVD IS 'EDITED FOR CONTENT'!,"I originally purchased this DVD about a year ago and when I watched it I thought there was something odd.I recalled seeing a scene at the theaters - the Marjoe Gortner/Victoria Principal 'peep' scene - that was strangely not present. I just figured it was something that I had imagined and wrote it off as a kid memory.UNTIL last night. I was watching AMC during their broadcast of 'Earthquake' and sure enough - there was the scene. Minus the nudity, of course. DAMNIT - I *knew* I didn't imagine that scene!Look I'm not some adolescent hoping to scope a one-second boob shot. Any cheesy web search brings a horde of incredibly worse imagery. What I am is a film fan wanting to see the movie *as it was intended*.This screams of 'moral censorship' or just as bad - professional incompetence on the part of Good Times Video! Either way:STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD! What a complete and utter waste of hard-earned money! }:("
3,Universal could have done better with this release...,"Universal finally releases ""Earthquake"" in the US on dvd. The only other domestic release was from GoodTimes several years ago. It's too bad that Universal didn't take the time to include the extended and deleted scenes that appeared in the television airing of the film. The only bonus here is a better looking film transfer, and the inclusion of the original ""Sensurround"" soundtrack, along with Dolby 5.1. 20th Century Fox pulled out all the stops with their special editions of ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure"". Unfortunately, Universal doesn't seem to care about preserving cinema history. Perhaps at some point Criterion will give ""Earthquake"" the royal treatment... The UK release of ""Earthquake"" from Universal included the theatrical trailer...the US one doesn't."
1,A Very Bad Disaster Flick,"Paying seven or eight great actors 1/6 of the national debt does not a great film make. Although it won two Oscars for Sound and Special Effects, it was an all-around terrible movie. There is little drama and suspense. The special effects were very cheesy. By the end, it is quite clear that the concrete columns are only styrofoam. The screenplay was written by Mario Puzo, author of ""The Godfather"". Shame on him for making such romantic and melodramatic drool. Even Heston and Gardner are not on the top of their games. The rest of the bit players, Kennedy, Nolan, Bujold, Greene, and Principal perform as admirably as a poor script can allow. The movie was nothing like the real thing."
2,"Shake it up, baby","Yowie! Here's one perfectly awful movie. It is watchable, however, and is enjoyable from the standpoint of it being rather ridiculous. The casting, for one thing, is bizarre. Having Ava Gardner cast as Lorne Greene's daughter, when in real life she was actually 2 years OLDER than him, is laugh-out-loud funny. And then there's bad toupe-wearing Charlton Heston, cast as Gardner's husband, who has little time for his wife but plenty of time for his French-accented lover (whose name I don't even want to attempt to spell right now; just look at the credits). Right-wing nut Heston isn't exactly Moses in this, is he? Evangelist Marjoe Gortner (remember him? You don't? It's just as well) plays a wacko (how fitting) who tends to get on people's nerves (especially the audience's). This is enjoyable schlock courtesy of Universal Pictures, who also gave us all those lousy Airport movies. If that sounds appealing, go for it."
3,Three stars for movie. Only one for this particular disc.,"I'm a stickler for movies on DVD presented the way they were in theatres. This is NOT in the original 20.2:1 aspect ratio, so you are not experiencing the movie as it was filmed and intended by the director, which makes this version sub-par."
2,"ok, i'll admit it -- it WAS fun watching charlton heston drown ...","the least of the big 3 of disaster movies (the others being ""poseidon adventure"" and ""towering inferno"") that hit across movie screens in the mid 1970s. the sensurround gimmick obviously doesnt work when seen on tv, the screenplay and acting are pedestrian, and the special effects now look a cut above flash gordon serials."
2,"CORNY,BUT SOMEWHAT ENJOYABLE.","ONLY WATCH THIS IF YOU ENYOY WATCHING PEOPLE FALL TO THEIR DEATH OR GET KILLED BY HUGE PIECES OF BUILDING LANDING ON THEM.AWFUL IN A GOOD WAY.....NOT GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS ,BUT IT WAS MADE IN THE 60'S"
2,Kind of dated!,The special effects may be good but I think the movie itself is kind of dated these days and like most disaster movies the special effects are the main attraction and the dialogue is a little hokey!
4,Natural disaster film,"Anyone who is a fan of natural disaster films will probably like this one. I always liked this film but I never got around to buying it, so I finally did.I gave it a 4-rating only because there are a few slow-moving parts in this film which I think could have been eliminated and substituted with more action or destruction segments. But on the whole it is a good natural disaster film with an all-star cast!"
4,Disasters galore,"Of the classic 3 disiater movies of the period, Poseidon adventure, Towering inferno and Earthquake. It does deserve last place. It is an action film in the biggest way but little character interaction as in the first two movies. It will complete your disaster collection. It has a good set of actor and actresses that pull off a mediocre script.Take it for what it is and enjoy the action."
2,earthquake,"I purchased this dvd for my collection to enjoy the sensurround effect with my home theater set up. It was not up to par with what I remember in theatrical release but on a smaller scale, it was enjoyable.What I found most disturbing was the fact that an entire scene had been omitted from this printing. The airport scene with the plane landing on a crumbling runway. Debralee Scott was a featured passenger on the plane, but I did not even see her name in the creditsBecause of the omission of that scene, I am giving the dvd my rating of 2 stars."
2,"Goodtimes doesn't 'make' movies. Oh, and this one is awful","Goodtimes is a small VHS/DVD distributor, usually of long forgotten bad movies and that's why their sooooooooo cheap.Of course you get what you pay for.And what do you expect with Charlton Heston?Eventually all 'Chuck's movies' will wind up in the Goodtimes bin!Because Charlton Heston can't act his way out of the proverbial paer bag.Chuck once had muscles (just like Popeye) and his biceps got him into the movies. But he always needed to be stuck in big budget epics like this brain fart. Why? Because if you pay attention to all the DTS Dolby stereo High definition yaddas then you won't notice the huy can't act!Even most Hollywood reviewers who like the poor big dumb fella have written that this is one of his worst.Yuk"
3,This movie (pardon the pun) ROCKS!,"Definitely the cheesiest disaster movie of all time! Charlton Heston absolutely hams it up (ala ""Ben-Hur"") as a construction engineer, Ava Gardner plays his wife....and Lorne Greene's daughter (?!), Genevieve Bujold pouts about as Heston's tarty mistress and George Kennedy is the cop with a heart (there's always one). A devastating quake finally hits LA. Things begin to shake, rattle and roll - especially busty Victoria Principal (in a really bad afro wig). The best part of this movie is watching LA crumble. Some of the quake effects are great - others are embarrassing. Still, it's still a fun disaster flick to watch. This reviewer would have given an extra star had the DVD included Dolby Digital Surround sound. Why show ""Earthquake"" in mono?"
5,This could well happen!,Mr. Charlton Heston went all out for this movie. Great movie from a time when all movies were exciting to watch.
3,Could have had better sound,"I first watched this movie when it came out in 1974. With todays home theater I was surprised to learn that this version does not have the wonderful sound that was on the origional movie. We own a wonderful home theater with a terrific huge sub-woofer. It would have sounded great, had the movie not been reproduced cheaply. Mono sound on a Supposely Dolby D. surround. Other wise if you do not mind a plain sounding earthquake, buy this DVD."
1,had to return,"although i was instructed that this was the correct harness for my car, it was not. i had to return this product.better pictures or better description would have prevented this return.i rated only 1 star because i had to return it, not because the product is below any standards."
1,The title of this book corresponds its content,"I started to read the book and eventully ended turning pages. May be odd pieces of information are of interest, but it is badly written, biased and full of mumbo jumbo. Regret I bought it."
4,"Slow heat-up, but great results","I've had this about 4 months now, and it's a great press. Better, in my opinion, than the le cruset version (which is smaller and has a too-small press).The downside to this one (and probably any cast iron panini press) is that it takes at least 5 min to heat up. I've only had good luck getting the press hot enough to toast with once I've let it heat for even more than that.Definitely spray some cooking spray on it the first few times you use it. Otherwise, bread sticks like crazy to both sides.I'd recommend this pan!UPDATE: after using for more than a year, this is a great press... liberal use of olive oil is the key. Get it. Still slower than my electric version on the heat up though, and requires a flip of the sandwich. But there's something more romantic about the manual stove top version! I've even done meat in it."
1,Very Underwehlmed,"Top does not heat up enough to sear what you put into the pan. Also, it's very, very hard to clean. I am really disappointed by this product."
5,Good Product,"I'm new to yoga and still very much need support. I like this product because it feels right... natural, like an extension of my limbs when I use it. And, it is light enough that I can move them--I have two--from position to position one-handed, with ease. I suppose wood might have the same natural feel, but I thought these would be less heavy. I am pleased with this purchase."
3,Great but damaged,"Received the blocks timely, and they're just as described, but one of them was damaged along one edge. They're still functional and it wasn't worth the price of shipping to send it back, so I didn't."
5,Hugger Mugger Cork Yoga Blocks,"I recently bought 14 of these blocks for my students to use. The response has been universally positive, so far. Everyone likes the heft of the blocks. They don't fall over when you need them to remain in place. Highly recommended!"
4,"Nice, but a little heavy","I wanted yoga blocks that are good for the environment, and these were the ones I ordered. They serve their purpose very well, but they are heavy. I wouldn't recommend them for taking to class--better used at home in your own yoga studio. I wouldn't want to carry them around."
2,Yoga Block Too Heavy,"I thought I would like this all cork yoga block. However, it was much heavier than others I have used. When used solely on the floor, it was fine, but when used between the legs, etc. it was too heavy to keep in place."
4,Quality,"I purchased two of these when I got pregnant and needed to start modifying my practice. They are a lot heavier then normal blocks, but in one respect I like that because they are really stable. However I use them sometimes between my ankles when I am lying on my back with feet elevated doing ab work post partum and they are really heavy and I have a hard time. Other then that, the added weight us usually useful. It looks a little different then the picture. All of the edges are equally rounded, more so then the photo leads you to believe, but that does not affect the usefulness of the block."
5,Good Yoga Block,I used this for the first time yesterday. One nice thing was there was no odor right out of the package. I like that it is made from natural materials. It provides firm stable support. The cork provides good grip and comfort. It doesn't offer much cushion if that is what you are looking for this might not be what you want. I was looking for something to help me in those positions where I am supposed to have a hand on the floor but am not flexible enough to do it. This works great for that!
5,Gorgeous book!,"Full of healthy, invigorating, energsing, soothng and delicious drinks and other recipes for mind, body & spiirt. Old style and homely using ancient wisdom and easy to follow recipes, this book is excellent for those looking to get back to health and stay healthy. Hard to find, but well worth it. Well presented, reseacched and great fun to make these teas and to keep brewing them as a daily, sacred ritual, something special each day. Loved the book so much I got one for a friend!"
2,Only a mild diversion,"McDonough's book is a bunch of anecdotes about his life as a not-particularly-accomplished cinemetographer. It's most enlightening aspects about about the nature of the old-boy network in film crafts, particularly how you get in the union. But most of it isn't very interesting, really."
1,poison dwarf,"awful book .... written by an awful man .... dont buy it, u will only be funding a very little mans big ego!"
4,Great book!,"I was quite hesitant when I picked up this book from the library. But, it was highly recommended. So, I thought why not... However, once I have started reading it, I was immersed in the story. The book is about the adventures of Prosper and Bo, who ran away from their dreadful aunt to Venice. Once in Venice, they bumped into Scipio, the Thief Lord, a kid himself with a mysterious identity. Scipio brought Prosper and Bo to his gang and gave them a ""home"". As Scipio took on a ""big"" job, his mysterious identity begins to unravel....A great book. Highly recommended to all."
4,Great Book and Audio,I listened to the thief lord on cd in my car on a road trip. was an excellent story and the reading was done exceptionally well.The story lagged at soome points and a few times the story seemed to be concluding. this happens in more than one instance and really i would have preferred to have gotton on with it.The Thief Lord is the story of orphans and runaways spending their days and nights in Venice. The children deal in stolen goods and petty theft to make ends meet. The fun and excitment of these late night thefts seems appealing in the story and even when things begin to come to light the children face very little consequence for their actions.I enjoyed the book but I will not read or listen to it again. Although I will admit it is written very well. Any young adult or adult will find it a good read.
4,The Theif Lord,"Although I'm not a book fan, I have to say that this book is one of the best books I have ever read. The story go smooth, every end of chapter, you want to keep reading. The style of writing is great! Same style as J.K Rowling (A little different) and even better. If you liked Harry Potter, you will like this book. I think 8 years old kids can read it! It is amazing how I liked this book, and I usualy don't like to read, so if I liked it, , , You will two."
2,Not too great,"I really got into the begging but put it down for a week and a half when I got to the middle. It get SO boring. The end is alright but I don't understand why it's so long. The cover may look interesting but really, trust me, it's not."
2,Derivative,"""The Thief Lord"" wouldn't be at the top of my list of the best young adult books. Cornelia Funke, the author, had little to offer that was worthwhile. I wouldn't recommend this."
3,"The Thief Lord Is OK, Keep'n it Real Beth Ann B.",If u like nonfiction then u will love this book.This book is about a group of kids that steal w/ a detective on thier tail. They Get him and I do mean the get him. They discover something wonderfully magical. U will love this book if u like suprises. I dont usually read books but this book is off!!!! It made me laugh & I was amazed at the stuff that happened because I never would have guessed it. It is an AWESOME book. I read this book 4 school & I loved If u like to get into a book an read something amazing then u will LOVE this book.
3,thief lord,cornelia funke is an exellent writer but i didnt really like the book there are parts that are exelent and parts that were boring but over all i really liked the story behind it all but in the words of reading rainbow dont take my word for itben ms hensons first hour
1,COPYCAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"ok, first of all, i would just like to say that when i first read this, i thought it was just ok, not really anything worth reading again, but not something to throw down in utter disgust either. If i had rated this book then, i probably would've given it either 3 or 4 stars. but then, sometime after that, i read Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury...ahem..yes Ms./Mrs. Funke, the carousel idea HAS been used already by someone with much better writing talent...Ray Bradbury, in fact. The same genius who wrote Fahrenheit 451. Next time, Cornelia should stick to an original piece, not some second rate copy of an idea. anyone with morals would do the same."
3,you get what you pay for,book on the outside is in great condition.in the description it said nothing about having library stickers all over it from previous use or people writing in it on the inside.
4,The Thief Lord,"The thief lord is a truly a fantastic story about the lives of prosper and Boniface ""bo"",two orphans who ran away from a spoiled aunt and a cruel uncle(in the orphans opinion),a boy named SCIPO,A BOY WHO PREFERS TO BE CALLED THE ""THIEF LORD"". THE THIEF LORD LEADS A GROUP OF STREET KIDS THAT LIVE IN A ABONDONED MOVIE THEATER CALLED THE ""STELLA"".AND A Magical merry-go-round that changes your age any time.and much much more!In my opinion I think the thief lord is a surprising , sad, adventurous story that most anyone will love . I say that because the author has a very interesting way of using deatail , making the chaRCTERS SEEM SO REAL,AND HOW SHE CREATES THE LANDSCAPE .THIS BOOK WILL BE WONDERFUL FOR ANY BETWEEN THE AGES OF 7 TO DEATH.ENJOY!"
4,Entertaining read,"Enjoyable read for children, teens, and adults alike. My son would love to see Venice after reading this tale."
4,The Theif Lord,This is an intriguing book that often has mysteries and conflicts that are hard for the characters to deal within the book. It is suspenseful and has a certain sense of adventure. i would like to recommend this to anyone who enjoys seeing what they read and have a vivid imagination.
3,Read my rewiew!! read my Review!!! (...) 13!! :),"i thought that this book will be good for anyone. if you like mysteries, then this book is for you. there are some parts in the book that made me want to fall asleep when reading it, but i think that people other than me will like this book. its about 5 children that runaway to venice italy. i dont want to give away any important parts, so you'll have to read this book to find out more. like i said before, this book can be really good. its a page turner. and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. but in other times there are parts that you just wish were over!! but cornelia funke is an amazing author. she has written really good books. and i think that would recomend this book for anyone out there to read it. so go ahead.... try it. you'd be surprised.(...). henson's first hour..."
5,"The Thief Lord ,by Jack the KY fan","I think the Thief Lord is an awesome book because of the excitement. The Thief Lord is a book that keeps you wanting to read more. If you like suprises and adventure then you would love this book! The Thief Lord has thrilling and exciting events taken place in Venice, Italy.The Thief Lord is a story about how 5 little runaway kids live in Venice, Italy. The 5 kids get fed and given to by the Thief Lord. The 5 kids meet a interesting person who becomes their friend. Something happens that will change their life forever!"
5,An Adventure in Venice,An Adventure in VeniceThe Thief Lord is a great mixture of realistic fiction and fantasy about a group of kids in Venice by Cornelia Funke.After their Mother and Father died Prosper and Bo ran away from home because their mean Aunt Esther wants to adopt only Bo and not Prosper. They meet a group of kids who hide out in an abandoned movie theater and are being provided with stolen goods to sell by the mysterious Thief Lord. While with the Thief Lord prosper and Bo Have life changing experiences.Personally I think that this book is the best ever! If you liked Harry Potter and fantasy it's basically the same thing with a little less magic.
3,Good for pre-teens,"This book displayed good detail of Vienna, althought it did not explain the full meaning of some of the actions or events that befalled the main charactors in its plots. Sit with this book when it's raining outside is a good idea. Good book for children who likes fantasy and adventure."
1,Boring and Predictable,"i had heard that the thief lord was an outstanding children's book and it turned out to be nothing of the kind. The author starts the story at a strange place, and uses back story to explain the origin of the thief lord. the titular character gets lost because of this. the story lacks the element of realism that strong fantasy has.also, the book is very predictable. i guessed who the thief lord was very early on.the whole story switched in the middle from being a book about a bunch of runaways and their stuggle to escape capture to being about a magical merry-go-round. this really comes out of left field and is very unappealing. Funke is a poor writer and i can't belive this book garnered such acclaim. it's not even as good as Holes, which also was an unexciting book. the thief lord did not capture my imagination at all."
2,Just OK,"I don't particularly like it. Although the discriptions are nice, it's not that great. I had trouble getting through the first 3-4 chapters. I just bought it for the heck of it, seeing how it was ""noticed"" so much. But YOU shouldn't bother. It's a waste of money. Borrow it from the library. Save yourself some money."
2,Glorification of tawdry lives and thievery,"I expect a quality work directed at the youth marketplace to help kids develop a sense of themselves and the values which will mold them into good citizens. Thief Lord does none of that.The story, set in Venice, is simplistic, predictable and emphasizes free will on the part of orphans who exercise their free will to the detriment of others (although this is glossed over). It seems to glorify pick-pocketing, sees nothing wrong with spending counterfeit money, and finally settles on the charity of a couple of open-hearted adults to solve all the kids' problems.I see little of redeeming value in this work and I will not give it to my granddaughter.Bob GouldWellesley, MA"
5,The Thief Lord,"This is a great book for readers of all ages. The main characters, two runaways, are as loveable as their aunt is awful. The only reason they ran away was because their aunt would only take in one of the two brothers when their parents died. They run away to the magical city of Venice and discover something that might solve their parental problem forever."
5,Not just for kids,As a thirty-something bookworm who enjoyed the Harry Potter books I've been making an effort to add more young novels (classics and new stuff) to my reading list. I'm so glad I chose this one. You'll be dreaming of Venice by the end of the frst chapter. It is simply enchanting.
2,Disappointed,"While the setting was richly described and the initial idea intriguing, the plot fell flat by the end of the text. I felt disappointed, both by how the story ended and by the lack of fully developed characters. It was unfulfilling, especially after such a promising start. I am hesitant to buy any other of her books; I would definitely recommend reading this in the library and not wasting your money buying this one. I'm selling it at my next garage sale. Save your money; there are better YA novels out there."
4,Thief Lord quality,"Simon Jones is a superb narrator, but the writing of this book is not top-notch. OK, just not in the Bartimaeus or Harry Potter zone of quality."
3,ben is awsome read this one miss henson...100 percent,i am awsome but this book isnt as awsome as me. it is a very good book about run aways money a deal and magic. i gave thise book only three stars becuase theyre are a lot of parts in this book were the authur just was writing to write if you know what i mean. but towards the end it starts to heat.in the words of reading rainbow but dont take my word for it100 percent please
5,An Amazing Boook,"The Thief Lord , by Cornelia Funke, is an amazing book. Prosper and his little brother Bo run away from their aunt after their mother dies. She had told them stories about Veince, Italy when she was alive so they go there. Victor, a detective, gets the case. Soon after, Hornet, a runaway girl that lives with Mosca, Riccio, and Scipio( The Thief Lord). When Scipio meets with the Conte, he wants them to steal a wooden wing. They met Ida the night they try to steal it. She agrees to give it up to see want the Conte does with it. They get, well, I think you should read it for yourself. Hope you like it as much as I did!"
4,Not too shabby,"Funke Weaves a wonderful tale full of twists and turns in The Thief Lord. Some characters are vividly painted with words while others lack any depth whatsoever. However, beginning readers will throughly enjoy the adventure story Funke takes them on.The story focuses on 5 kids who are a gang of thieves. The Thief Lord is their boss. He keeps them safe, feeds them, and clothes them. The children are all orphans so naturally they depend on the thief lord. But when the thief lords identity is revealed, and detective tries to track down some of the missing children. Things get a little messy, and magical.The story is an excellent one for younger readers. Funke never fails to deliver a satisfactory story. Her chapters are short, geared toward younger readers and her prose is simple and understandable. Thief Lord is a must read!"
5,Her best,Great story and nicely written. My son loved it. It awakened an interest in Venice and Italy that I could never have predicted. Funke's best by a long shot.
4,Interest to All ages,"The Thief Lord was recommended to me and I'm so glad I bought it for my Kindle e-reader. My children, ages 13 and 16, enjoyed the book as well. It has encouraged us to plan on going to Venice!"
2,Not thrilling,"This book was definatly not one to brag about. It was written well enough. The story was just boring beond reason. There was not romance, no real action, and no major plot twists. It just seemed a complete, blah. I was expecting something amazing when i picked it um and was greatly disappointed. If you have a lot of free time and nothing to do read this book. But if not i would recomend buying it."
2,Spazzer's Comments,"The summary sounded intriguing, but it was the exact opposite. While I was trying to read it, I felt that it was forced. The only reason I read on was b/c I thought it was going to be something more.While her style of writing doesn't appeal to me, I guess it is okay. Maybe some will enjoy it, but it will not be the next HP."
4,An interesting read!,"I first learned about this book last December 2002 and decided to buy it on December 23, 2002. After reading the first two chapters I was already hooked up. The story was great! Just like Harry Potter and the Wind of Fire Trilogy, it has breathless adventures and a nice plot."
2,Just OK,"I picked up this book because Amazon has been recommending it to me for quite some time now. It passed the time, but it never really picked up. It lacked the magic promised in the reviews. The plot wandered and there was no climax. there were so many loose ends at the finish that I thought for sure there was going to be a sequel. Disappointing overall."
3,"Good, but not for adults.","I read this book on the recomendation that it was very much like Harry Potter. While it was well written and the story was decent, it was not as good as Harry Potter in that it is much more for kids. Adults will not take as much from this book as they will from HP.If you are buying this for a kid, I would say go ahead and get it, because the story is good and its a good read. If you are a grown-up kid, though, perhaps another book would be better."
5,Great,The book was in better condition than I thought. The price was right and the item came quickly!!
3,Sutherland is goin to college for b-ball 18 points in one game,Well the book is okay it is not the best it doesn't have alot of action at the begining. The action in increase when you close to finishing thke book. Some of my friends really like it but i thought it was okay. There was some really cool things they did but i can't tell you that.Well my friends like it so i guess it lis me but i would try to get some one to read likse Jalen Phillips would probably like this book.If Jalen Phillips didn't like it i would prbably tell Andrew Peterson to read it. Sutherland is goin to college for b-ball 18 points in one game.
3,Good book but not the best,"The Thief Lord is a good book. Very exciting, there is no lull in the action or plot. The setting is perfect for the story and is portrayed perfectly. The story is predictable and the ending a bit choppy, but the Thief Lord is a good read."
4,The Stealing Guy,"My review is about The Thief Lord by Cornelia Funke. This book is about six kids that live in an old shutdown movie theater. The leader, the thief lord, steals things to trade for money. The kids try to steal a wing and trade it for five million lire. I would recommend this book to people who like to read long and challenging books."
2,Theif Lord...I was rather Bored... by artemis11,"It was an OK book, if you like books where 5 years olds become aspiring thieves =(. Well anyway I better review it:The book starts when a wealthy lady come to Victor a Private Investigatior with a request to find her nephews. He accepts and eventally finds them, and begins to like them yada yada yada....You know what happens...They escape with the help of their friends...Everything turns out for the better...Typical Pre-Teen book...A review by artemis11"
1,Not a good story,"I read this to see what all the clatter was about on this book. I had heard good things about it, and after reading it and falling asleep in the middle of several chapters, and forcing myself to finish, I found out that I did not really care for the story or the style it was written in. I found it hard to read and keep up with the different characters. It would get started on a fairly good part, and then the bottom would fall out, and I was left wondering where the stuff of the story actually was. The really good parts are few, and the rest drag on way too long. Now I know why my son did not finish. If it can't keep a 41 year old even mildly entertained, how can it keep a nine year old boy interested?"
4,The thief Lord,"This book was really good. but first I thought that it would be reallllllly boring!!!! if you look at the cover, it doesn't really look interesting.But if you really think about it, it does look pretty good.Ok, now we can go on into the story part. There are these boys (orphans) named prosper & Bo. They are owned by thier two mean, Uncle and mean Aunt. they run away and now prosper can't find Bo."
3,Children's Adventure with a sprinkle of fantasy,"'The Thief Lord' tells the tale of a group of children, some orphans, others runaways, who live in an abandoned movie theater in Venice. Prosper & Bo have fled Germany to get away from their aunt and uncle. They are taken in by another youth, Scipio, the 'Thief Lord', who provides them with food and shelter. They meet three other children, Riccio, Mosca and a girl known as Hornet. Scipio provides for them by thieving and selling the goods to a shady shopkeeper named Barbarossa. One day Barbarossa arranges a meeting between the Thief Lord and an equally mysterious count who wants a special item stolen. All the while Prosper and Bo are being sought by a private detective named Victor, hired by the boy's aunt.It is an enjoyable story, with an interesting setting, Venice in winter. It is mostly an adventure story, but there is a strong fantasy element introduced in the second half of the story."
4,The Thief Lord - an awsome book!,"I think The Thief Lord is a great book. It is about two brothers named Prosper and Bo who escaped from their evil Aunt Esther. The two brothers run away to Venice. There, they find a group of street kids and you'll find out how the group manage to survive.The reason why I gave the book only a four stars is because the plot is nice but the dialogue and vocabulary is a little confusing. In The Thief Lord, Cornelia Funke uses many Italian words. In the back there is glossary of the Italian words. It's distracting to keep going back and forth frequently.So, if you are thinking about buying a mystery/adventure book, pick up The Thief Lord! I can't speak for everyone, but for me it is a GREAT book!"
4,The Thief Lord,"The Thief Lord is about two boys who are orphans who runaway form their aunt and uncle. They runaway to Venice, Italy. Their aunt and uncle therefore come looking for them. Prosper and Bo run into a girl named Hornet who is a orphan as well. She takes them to The Theif Lord who then leads the kids on an extravagant journey.I thought this book was a very suspenseful novel and it kept me on the edge of my seat to see what happened next."
2,Disappointing,"This is a good book for a younger audience. The characters are engaging and engage in activities that the younger set would find interesting. For those of us who have read Ray Bradbury, however, it is very disappointing that a big part of the plot relies on something he has already done much better."
2,Um..not quite what I suspected,"I have heard a lot about this book, most of it good, but I must admit that it wasn't as utterly fantastic as most people have told me. It seemed to take me forever to get through this book. The storyline was flawed (first a bunch of theives-which was quite interesting-but a MAGICAL MERRY GO ROUND?) the ending was predictible, and there didn't seem to be alot of obstacles to pass to get to the main goal. The Thief Lord was a pretty boring book--even though it has been compared to it, this book has nothing on Artemis Fowl."
2,"Decent story, poor execution","I picked up the Thief Lord after hearing so many comparisons to it and to Harry Potter. After finishing it though, I realized that the two books/series could not be further apart. Harry Potter books are successful because the characters and relationships are so well thought out and, while the magic may be fantasy, the relationships seem real. In this book, the story almost never strays from real life into fantasy, except in the development of the actual characters. The main character, Victor, is almost a characature of a dumb detective, and is never even believable as that. His relationship with the kids who are the focus of the book borders on the rediculous and later development of a ""relationship"" between him and a female characer comes from nowhere, with no build up. No one is really believable as a real life character.I give it 2 stars though because the most central character, the city of Venice, was described and included so well in the story."
2,Fairy Tale Under the Guise of Fantasy,"I have been a long time lover of epic fantasy and suspense novels and I must say that this was a bit of a disappointment. It started out good, with two young runnaways, a gang of child theives (modern Robin Hoods, as I see them) but as you neared the end my attention started to slack away as the novel started to feel an awul lot like a volume of Fairy Tales. I kept expecting pixies to jump out any minute!I will admitt that this book had its good parts. It was clear that it had been well planned and it was written well, the charecters were great (and the secret of Spicio came as a huge suprise, hint, hint) but if you are looking for an epic fantasy/adventure novel, look elsewhere."
2,snoozer,This books was SLOW. It wasn't until the last 1/4 of the book before it actually started to hold my interest. The only reason I finished this book was so I wouldn't feel so bad for spending the money I did on this book.
3,"Good adventure, needed editing","We read this together as a family read-aloud. We enjoyed the adventure story, but we all agreed that this book needed more editing. Every step, every motion, every gesture is described in detail, and it gets in the way of the plot. You really don't have to tell us every time someone turns their head or leans against a wall! Maybe we're unfamiliar with the German writing style, but we found these unnecessary descriptions very tedious, and ended up skipping entire paragraphs.On the other hand, for such a wordy book, The Thief Lord really doesn't capture the magical atmosphere of Venice. Instead of describing the characters' every extraneous move, the author could have painted a more detailed picture of this amazing city.All in all, we found The Thief Lord to be better than most contemporary children's fiction. The plot is a four-star adventure story, but the style keeps it at the three-star level."
4,:),"...THE THIEF LORD by Cornelia Funke is a very nice story that stands on its own...it was a fast read, although I am a bit above the target age, so that might have been why. The descriptions of Venice were great. Most of the characters were likeable without being perfect, something that is very hard for most authors to pull off. My only problem was that the ""secret"" of the merry-go-round was not that original--just read SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES by Ray Bradbury after you read THE THIEF LORD, and you'll see what I mean."
5,Exciting,"I was intriqued through the entire story, I couldn't put the book down. It was exciting, thrilling, fun and I love the setting in Venice - my favorite city in Italy! I wanted to share it with my grandsons and have raved to many people about it."
5,LOVE the story. Add it to your library!!!,"I absolutely loved this story. I listened to it on audio cds in the car and found myself taking the ""long way"" to hear more of the story. I'm completely impressed with the writing and creativity of the author. I like that it was completely unpredictable. I felt all emotions... It's a great mixture of adventure and it's pretty scary in some parts. Definately kept me interested from beginning to end. I also really enjoyed the narrator. In fact, I loved the story because of the narrator! Great character voices, etc. I give it 2 thumbs up!! A must have for your library."
2,Good begining but near end it got boring,that is all I have to say. I never even finished the book it was too boring. The beginning is cool but the end (no offense) sounds like an episode of Dora the Explorer. A magical merry go round......seriously? I could just here the Dora the Explorer theme song in my head as I was reading it....do do do do do dora do do do do do dora dora dora dora the explorer.......
2,Not that Great,"I thought this book was too slow paced and the characters never were faced with a big challenge. They hardly got in trouble, they would get close, but they always escaped, so there wasn't a thrilling moment where you just HAD to know what happened next. Though the story is slow, the things that happen are pretty interesting, even if the author doesn't make it quite that exciting. The Thief lord(character not book)reminded me a bit of Artemis Fowl come to think of it(except not as good)."
2,Not Captivating,"I found the beginning of the book to be interesting, but it got really terrible in the middle. The story was not engaging, the characters not especially interesting, and the translation was rough in places. Yes, Venice is beautiful, and the scenery was used well, but the magic was very contrived, unlike the ubiquitous magic in the Harry Potter series, or the underworldly magic in Artemis Fowl.Skip it."
4,A Great Book,"The Thief Lord is a great book for young adult readers. It is very well-written and has a deep, original plot full of memorable characters and places. The setting for the book, Venice, Italy, is a very fine selection that provides a great background for the twisting and turnings of the storyline.This book is about two young orphaned boys, Prosper and Bo, who seek shelter in Venice from the custody of their horrible Aunt Esther, who wishes to split them apart. During their stay they meet a group of other orphans who hide in an abandoned movie theater and rely on a mysterious boy who prefers to be called ""the Theif Lord"" to steal valuable items for them, which they later exchange for money from a sneaky and arrogant haggler called Barbarossa. Soon after Prosper and Bo's arrival, a detective tries to find them and from there on the plot twists itself into some unforgettable encounters...."
2,Surprisingly Bland...,"I began reading the book with great expectations, but was quickly let down. For whatever reason (don't know if it's the translation or the author's overall storytelling), the book never catches fire. What should be a grand adventure just falls flat. For all that goes on, Funke just can't seem to generate any real sense of excitement or danger necessary for an adventure story, nor does she manage to envoke any real sense of wonder necessary for a fantasy story. It's a sweet story, but so bland in it's execution that it fails to satisfy. The only thing the book really did for me was spark an interest in Venice. Young readers less jaded than I may find the book entertaining, but for me it was, more often than not, a bore."
4,A Great Read,"The Thief Lord was wonderful book! I have only a small bit of criticism. I though the characters weren't described that well. The only thing that the author seemed intent on describing fully was the city of Venice, which she did, superbly. The fantasy/magic component emerged far to late in the book. Also, the moral at the end of the story is a fascinating one which really makes you think, but not enough of the story leads up to it. It comes very suddenly. I read this book after hearing it compared to Harry Potter. I found the two to be very different. This book is well worth reading, but if you are looking for more fantasy/magic type book(s) read Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings ( and other books related to it by J.R.R. Tolkein including The Hobbit, etc.), and His Dark Materials."
2,I've read a million books like this one,"Everyone was saying that this was a really good books and that I just HAVE to read it or I'll die, but personally, I think it wasn't that great. I mean, it's your basic story about two orphans who run away and join a gang when their parents die. They have to steal something or else they will be turned into the police, blah, blah... Its only unique element is the magical merry-go-round. I won't say anything about that except: weird, but a little funny. You won't be missing out if you don't read this."
4,a great kid fantasy,"I read this with my eleven year old daughter and we both liked it a lot. The writing and story line are both good, but I wouldn't say great. The big appeal of this book is the kid fantasy of living without grown ups. I loved that kind of stuff as a kid and it brought back all my memories of childhood games about secret hideouts and outwitting grown ups. There was also a bit of Robin Hood in the story and a great setting to boot. Well worth reading for any kid or any grown up who likes remembering childhood."
4,A journey that changes their course of destiny,"In the magical underworld of Venice, Italy, there are hidden canals and crumbling rooftops. This is a novel about Prosper and Bo, two little boys escaping their awful guardians. They meet a mysterious ""Thief Lord"" who has a dark secret, that will soon embark them on a journey that changes their course of destiny.My favorite part is when the Thief Lord's dark secret is revealed, and trust is being weighed between him and his group of friends. This is an adventurous fantasy book but at the same time teaches about friendship, loyalty, and trust. Without one adventure or the other, it won't make such of a good book.I think 5-7th graders should read this book mostly because it teaches about friendship and who or when to trust. Especially when growing up, you would still need some adventure in you but at the same time know what's happening in life. -- Chou-Chou"
4,Thief Lord - Cornelia Funke,"The thief lord is a richly written book. I like the way the characters are expressed to their true potentials. Funke manages to bring out humour in the children as well as tradgedy, treachery, honesty, and a strong bond of love between Bo and Prosper. I would rate this book 4/5 suffering very little from bias.Yasmin Rasul 12"
4,A fun and fast read,"I was excited when I heard that this book was possibly the next Harry Potter. It was a quick and easy read. The characters were colorful and well developed. The plot was easy to follow. However, it did not leave me yearning for a follow-up installment as did each of the Harry Potter books. As a fifth grade teacher, I am looking forward to reading it to my class and hearing what they think."
5,I loved it!,"I randomly picked this book up at the school library when I was in a hurry. I started to read it in, and I got really hooked. I loved it and finished it in two days. The book takes place in Venice Italy, and its about these two boys who have run away from their aunt, and join a group of runaway kids who are led by the Thief Lord. Meanwhile, their aunt hires a detective to look for the two boys. All the characters are really developed and the whole book and plot was interesting and fun. There is even some magic involved in the book. Its a really good story, and I highly recomend it to any readers!"
2,Not in keeping with all the praise,"I was greatly disappointed by this book. Funke didn't write it as well as the praise for her book suggest. The book just didn't have the qualities that I love in other books had and what we, the readers, have come to expect from books like Ms. Rowling's. It didn't have the suspense, the action, or the mystery that it should have either."
3,Poser,I didn't like this like I thought I would. Tries to be a lot of different things but doesn't make it on any level at least not for me. The characters are flat and unlikeable. The plot not even so-so.
2,Doesn't compare...disappointing!,Thief Lord doesn't compare well to similar books. I didn't like it and was disappointed. There are so many other books that are better. Enough said.
4,A great read!,"I have been a fan of Funke since reading this book. As a middle school teacher, I see students with her books frequently. They love them too. Inkheart gets a little dark, but is still an entertaining story. Get it, you'll like it."
4,just what I needed,"I am having trouble with my knees and I bought this walker to use when I have a flare-up.It is very helpful and I don't have to depend on my husband to help me walk now.When I got it,it didn't slide very well so I bought a set of walker glides for the back legs.They make it slide across any surface that I have been on.The walker folds easily and is light weight.I would recommend this walker for anyone,short or tall.The legs can adjust to fit."
4,Very Fun...,"This game was very fun for me,15. It was fun but i completed it in about 2 days... not long at all. I loved designing the clothes. I recommend buying this item, but i think that this game is more of a 13 and under game."
2,Not very fun,"This game is pretty fun, you design clothing, put makeup and hairstyles on models, but its really hard to get past some parts. Right now I am stuck on one part of the game that is EXTREMELY hard. The game keeps ""executing"" whatever I create. It can get very frusterating at times. I don't recommend this game if you expect to get to the end of it."
1,Not worth the three bucks I spent on it.,"This game is not fun at all. It is tedious, boring, and has no replay at all. The commercials make it look like a paper doll type game, but in truth, it's a puzzle of sorts. You've given goals and you have to fulfill them, but sometimes what they want is counter-intuative. One level has you making a pale-eyed Scandanavian model dressed in warm winter clothing. But they want green eyes. Most people would assume blue or brown, but if my Aunt hadn't suggested green on a lark, I would have been stuck until I tried all color combinations.To be fair there is one nice thing about it. Mainly, when you scrwe up, the game tells you where you screwed up and why. You get a list of goals; model, makeup, eyes, cloth, ect., and it tell you which one is wrong. But you still have to go through the entire stage again. All in all, when the best thing about the game is when it tells you how you failed, that's the sign of a bad design."
2,Horrible.,"First there is no story line. Second, the models have an annoying smirk on their face whenever you put makeup on them like you are extremely stupid. Third, it is extremely hard. Fourth,they give you a big, fat, red, X when you do a task wrong. I have no idea how this game is so popular. I felt victory when i turned it in."
1,NO FUN,"I am 26 yrs old and i bought this game because it looked fun and cute. I also love fashion and design. But this game was so frustrating! You really can't be creative because you have to do the levels over and over again until you get the color, pattern or cut EXACTLY the way the computer wants it to look. I don't know how younger girls are suppose to enjoy this game. It makes me want to cry."
2,Bad graphics and gets alittle boring at times,"This game was a hit until my daughter got to the the 9th level. It was very hard to see what the fashion creators want. It has to be the EXACT look the people want. Otherwise, you have to keep on trying and trying again and again. The graphics are ""creepy"" my daughter says. Sometimes, on the women they show parts that you should not see. This game is OK, but not the best. If your daughter loves fashion, I would not reccomend this game."
3,"Fun, but sometimes difficult for younger people.","This game overall was pretty fun, but if you are not artistic,and you like completing levels and not taking your time to make your best choice, it could become a little bit frustrating. I am ten, nine when I got this game, and some levels are hard, and you have to redo them many times if you don't get it correct the first try. Yes, I know, that is the point of the game, but sometimes you have to redo it so many times that it gets boring. This, I think is because the clues are very broad. Example: Pick out three African hairstyles. Out of the many it is very hard to find the three correct answers. Even if you get two out of the three correct, it won't tell which is wrong; you just have find the correct three from scratch. I would recomend this to a perfectionist."
3,I don't really like it...,"I just don't think it's very fun. The graphics are terrible, and that gets annoying. I dislike the tasks, they aren't very flexible, and sometimes you can't even make your way through them. If you can pick this up for 10$ or less, go for it, but I can say that I don't think it's worth nearly 30$."
2,Not for early readers,"This is a great game, for older girls. My kindergartner was frustrated with the amount of reading in it that was beyond her level, as well as some of the gameplay. This game has been regulated to the, play when she is a bit older pile."
4,GOOD INTRODUCTION TO DESIGNING,"This game is a good introduction for young folks in designing fashion. I like the concept it has for ""assignments"" where you have to please a client in their requests for fashions.The designer has to come up with make-up, clothes and sometimes accessories and hair styles to pass the assignment to move on to the next task.I didn't find anything in this to be particularly suggestive or even suggest nudity or anything out of the ordinary in dealing with clothing or the dressing of models.I recommend this game. Especially young folks will love it. I thought it was kind of fun and I'm an adult!"
4,Good for younger girls,"If you want a video game for a girl under 13 then this one is it. It took me (I'm 29) about 3 hours to complete the whole game (the ""Blue"" Challenge took me forever!!) but I imagine a younger girl will be entertained with this for much longer. If you have a girl older than 13 then you might want to get her something a little more challenging, unless all she wants to do is design clothes instead of complete missions. The patterns the game comes loaded with are kind of ugly so I mainly stuck to the plain colors. I wish there was more of a sweater collection and more jewelry than just necklaces. Over all, I think this is a good game for young girls and I'd recommend it."
5,Fashion Designer,"I purchased ""Fashion Designer"" DS Nintendo game for Christmas for my 13-year old granddaughter. Her aspiration is to become a fashion designer or graphic art major. Needless to say, she loves the ability to be creative! She, also, has a 11 year sister who likes to play it too!"
4,it really fun,i really like this game i got everything so far there is no more makovers but one and i have spend hours and hours trying to do that but i just can't dp it. i got really frustrated so i have not played it in a whille but over all i think its a really fun game
1,Boring!,I got this game because i love shopping and clothes! But i tried this and i wasn't impressed you don't do much you are basically repeating over and over again i would not recommend this to anyone worst imagine game ever!
3,Honestly it's not too bad,"The game is for younger girls. I'm guessing ages 6-11. The game play is very elementary.The graphics are pretty poor. It's quite blurry and if you like crisp graphics, I wouldn'trecommend the game.However, I would recommend the game for young children, I don't think they will mind."
4,Excited then disappointed,I purchased this game from a local store. It installed fine and I fell in LOVE with this game only to find out that my computer would not be graphically compatible with the game. Intel graphics do not work well with this game. Most of the features are available but not the ones like earrings and makeup that require a zoom in. Otherwise its a FABULOUS game! Just disappointing abt that part. Check the box for specifics.
4,Imagine fashion desiner REVIEW,First it was fun and exiting when you start playing it. like when I went to my friends house one time she showme the game and I play it for awhile it was very fun. I really liked it so sometimes on weekends after my homework is done I go over to play it.But when you play it to much it gets less fun and also a little boring just getting the stuff want to buy. But when you play it once in a while it's backto fun again...
4,Good Gift,"I got this game for my little sisters 8th birthday and she really liked it. We got stuck on the level that asks you to create a military outfit and we still haven't figured it out, but up to that point she loved it. Guess i'll google it. Good price, good product."
4,pretty fun!,"I reccomend this game for girls maybe 8-14. In the game, you have tasks and you have to make certain clothes and patterns. You do this for several levels. It does get challenging. Also, you can design your own clothes in your free time, take pictures, and run the runway. I was sad once I finished but I did enjoy it! Some parts of the game shouldn't be for under 8 because the models have to wear bikinis. But overall I love this game!"
3,Daughter loves it...,"My eight year old daughter thinks this is the coolest...Loves to be a model, do the designing..."
5,Early days of interactive computing,"TUTOR was the programming language used for PLATO, the world's first successful interactive, online community. Elaine Avner's book is a summary of the language commands and system variables. For many of us who got our introduction to computers through PLATO, this book is a genuine artifact."
2,Baby Bargains,"The book seems to be very helpful when reading, however, when one tries to source some of the information it is not accurate. The web site listed in the front of the book that supposedly has updated information will not load at this time. The number one ""A"" crib manufacturer (Simmons) will not sell direct to end users as is implied in the book. The Simmons web page doesn't even list the two recommended cribs, ""Lucena"" and ""Sutherlin II."" As anyone who has read this book will tell you, the crib information is in the first chapter so I hope the rest of the authors recommendations are much more accurate. Copywrite of my copy is 2000."
3,"Few savings, but essential tips on what to buy","I doubt this book will save us much money. Despite their claims, the authors seem to prefer most of the gadgety items and almost always the highest-priced items ($500 for 100% cotton bedding, versus $200 for cotton blends? Gee, that's not a tough decision for us budget-conscious new parents, even if the all-cotton sheets ARE nicer...). However, the book is most useful for its no-nonsense style in cutting through the baloney and telling you what you really need to buy, as opposed to what the baby store tells you you ""really need"" to buy. For this reason alone it is worth buying."
5,So much valuable information,"This is a great book, especially for first time parents. It completely sorts out what's necessary and what's not when it comes to the completely overwhelming world of baby products. The Consumer Report book does not contain 1/10th of the valuable information that this book does. Everytime I learn that a new friend of mine is pregnant, I buy this book for them. It's like a bible!"
5,BUY this book before you buy anything else for your baby!!!,"Forget the ""What to Expect when Expecting""... You will learn more from this book about what a baby needs and what he/she can live without. I thought this was one of the BEST books I bought when I was pg. I have bought it for shower gifts, and told many, many people about it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED even if you already have a child/children. I have saved a lot of $$$ with this book."
4,Great product reviews,"We found this book extremely helpful for product reviews and descriptions. It didn't really help us save any money, but it did help us pinpoint what we needed-why we needed it-and what was the ""best"" brand for the money. Their website offers updates and more current information so it is a good idea to check the website also before buying."
5,This is the BEST book on where to shop for baby stuff!,"This is the best book I found to help me learn what to look forto judge quality on strollers, car seats, and more! I will notgo shopping for baby items without this book."
3,Informative but not Objective,"This book provides essential information in determining how you prepare for your baby, but it has its limitations. I enjoyed the initial information on how to approach things and what to look at, but was extremely dissapointed in their choices of what rated an A. They seemed very down on the service at Babies R Us. As I have become intimately familiar with this store, I must say that I have not found the same situation. I understand that their experiences have not been good and that service varies store to store, but I have had nothing but great service at Babies R Us. The book is worth getting, but use your own judgement when applying what is written to your life. A Peg Perego stroller was not a necessary item for me."
5,Great Help for First Time Parents,"I love this book. It is helping us get ready for our first child. I don't agree with the ""posh"" thing that another reviewer said. As a parent, I want things that are safe for my child and if that means spending money for better built baby equipment so be it. I look at it this way, if you want stuff that's inexpensive, you're going to get cheaply made stuff that's going to fall apart. If you want good quality, you're going to have to pay for it. They're trying to prevent you from buying things that could harm your child."
3,Good book but for very advance users only,"This book is for IT professional only.Don't expect this is a step by step series book.The author leaves you to investigate the concepts on already built worksheets from the disc that comes with the book. Doing so leaves a lot of assumptions that you know what you look for to begin with.However if you are very advance users, you might find it better that way since the number of pages reduce a lot.It means you can finish the book much sooner and the book can be a good comprehensive reference.To general public, it is a 3 stars,but I would give it a 4.5 stars because I do learn something from it."
1,"Delicate material, install with caution","This material is soft and will not take much torque before the square drive head becomes twisted through by its driver. Do not use without pre-drilling the wood, and lubricating the shank of the screw with soap or another lubricant. I would not be surprised to find that this stainless screw will rust. Almost useless. Find another stainless wood screw source.Lucky Reader"
3,"Decent review, but you'll need more for a high score","""Cracking the AP US History"" is a perfect book for a quick review before the AP or test during the year; its summaries are for the most part easy to understand, inclusive of major people and events, and concise enough to make for a quick read.However, this book is NOT an appropriate alternative to sitting down with whatever history book you use during the school year and really studying. I would strongly advise against relying on ""Crack the AP US History"" for your primary study resource.I found that the AP exam that the book includes is good for seeing how well you know your stuff before really sitting down and studying, but again, is woefully inadequate to prepare one for the actual exam. I would strongly recommend getting other AP exams, questions and DBQs from your teacher to compliment this book.A decent buy as a review book, but by no means guarantees a 5, 4 or even 3 alone."
2,Not enough for the exam,"It helps summarize the course, but that's about it. The practice tests were a lot easier in the book than on the actual exam, and the summaries were a bit too broad, only about 75% of the actual test was covered on the summaries. I recommend taking a lot of practice tests for review on the objective part, and then reading a broad summary of the course for the essay questions to get a good overview for what they are trying to ask."
4,It's the best one out there..,"Not sure if that says much, since the competition isn't fierce. This book definately has the best review out there, yet this book lands flat in several respects. First off, the DBQ and Essay instruction is not terrific, it could definately use improvement. Second of all, the multiple-choice questions seem to be much easier than the actual test. Ths is not a good sign, as it makes the test taken too confident of him/herself.Still, if you're looking for an AP US History test book, go with this one (the newest version, I guess :P)"
3,"Decent Review, but No Guarantee of a 4 or 5","""Cracking the AP US History"" is a perfect book for a quick review before the AP or test during the year; its summaries are for the most part easy to understand, inclusive of major people and events, and concise enough to make for a quick read.However, this book is NOT an appropriate alternative to sitting down with whatever history book you use during the school year and really studying.

3,Christopher Hitchens recommends this in THE ATLANTIC,In the March'08 ATLANTIC number he proposes it as 'one of the greatest autobiographies of the 20th century'.
4,very happy,"Shoes are very comfortable. When first putting them on, it felt like they were bulky and that my feet would slide around inside of them while I played. Once I started playing they seemed to hug my feet very well. They weren't too bulky or heavy and were very comfortable. Overall I am very happy with them and very very happy about the build quality for the price. Would definitely recommend."
1,Doesn't work,Got a second one after the first one stopped recording after less than a year. The second one didn't work from the start. Will try something else.
1,Unreliable Performer with Glitches,"This was the second AT&T answering machine I bought. My first one lasted over two years before it fried. For some reason, I figured AT&T would still be my best bet. Wrong.This machine started to go n the fritz after a few months. During playback, messages would drop in and out. These glitches made many messages irretrievable. And the problem has only gotten worse.I am now fed up with this product and AT&T. I will never buy another answering machine from them, and neither should you."
2,Hard to understand messages,"The answering machine is pretty simple to use. I do have difficulty understanding the callers messages. Messages sound muffled and unclear, as if they are talking through a tube."
1,not a very good machine,"This is not a very good machine. It has a good automated greeting with a male voice saying simply, ""Hello. Please leave a message after the tone."" However, sometimes it would only say ""Hello-"" and then the rest of the automated outgoing message would be cut off and the machine would go straight to the beep. I returned one of these machines because of this, and the one I exchanged it for did the same thing. Another problem is that it lets a caller just keep punching in an infinite number of touch tones without hanging up on them. If the caller happens to hit on your three-digit remote access code, the machine goes right into the remote access menu, where the caller can do pretty much anything with your machine or even listen to what's going on in your home with the machine's ""monitor"" feature. I would not recommend this machine. AT&T does not automatically mean quality like it used to."
1,Cuts callers off,I've only had one problem with this machine but its a big one. It's cuts callers off in the middle of their message...no where near the 4 minute mark. I've had hang ups on friends and business customers.
4,"Easy-to-use, reliable, long-lasting, inexpensive","I have owned the twin model Lucent 1725 for about two years. These handy tapeless digital answering machines are a huge improvement over analog tape machines. Functional buttons are all intuitive. My only complaint, mentioned by others, is that individual messages can not be advanced forward and back; you have to listen to the entire message or skip it. Remote access works well, almost as useful as a voice mail system, but at a much lower fixed cost, instead of incurred monthly fees. Interesting feature I have never had any use for is the room monitor which allows you to listen to your room remotely."
2,"Although initially promising, falls flat in performance.","Although my sister has rave reviews for another AT&T answering machine model, I have been disappointed with this one. The AT&T 1717 has a poorer playback quality than the analog model I used to have- if this were the only problem, I would still recommend it as a medium-grade answering system at a fair price for the features it offers. The fact that it also cuts off random messages, however, prompts me to ask for a return. This answering system looks good on paper, but doesn't follow through with reliable performance."
2,Great while it lasted,"We were quite satisifed with this answering machine for about four months. It was easy to use and had good sound quality. And then its performance slipped dramatically. It stopped responding to some calls, and sometimes it would make it so that the phone connected to it would have no dial tone and be unable to answer calls. We then tried it on a different phone line with a different phone and still had the same problem. It seemed to work right about a third of the time, and we ended up replacing the unit. But it was great while it lasted."
1,bad news,"i bought the 1717 after my old lucent died after 7 yrs. first one, the outgoing message became inaudible after 1 wk. 2 wks. the outgoing msg. was inaudible. does't keep outgoing volume mute if you retrieve msgs. you will hear if you don't set the volume down to 3 beeps. why?"
2,half a machine,This machine is good if you only need to hear half of each message. It was very consistant with disconnecting while someone was still speaking.
4,"Decent valued, no-nonsense answering machine.","I've had this machine for almost a year now and have been very satisfied. Although digital, the sound quality is almost as good as a tape, though it does sound a bit tinny at times.The 2 digital answering machines I've had before this (one Bell South, the other GE) both gave me the problem of hanging up on people in the middle of their messages. It seemed like half my messages were people saying, ""Hi Ben, I'm calling back because your machine cut me off..."". I've never had that problem with this AT&T, it's very reliable.It also does a good job of cutting out messages that are nothing but dialtones (although one does slip in there every now and then) while also giving you time to screen the call. It's a nice gadget, very compact, and well worth the price."
4,A Spartan Wonder,"This machine is a no frills easy to use telephone answering system. I had it out of the box and working in just under one minute. PROS- (1)Inexpensive, (2)Easy to set up, (3)Easy to use. CONS- (1)Recording quality is not the best, (2)12 Minutes of recording time may not be enough for some consumers, however, 12 min. is more than enough for most users, (3)There is no three. To sum it all up, this is a great ""bang for your buck"" answering machine!"
3,Great machine that didn't stand the test of time,"The AT&T 1717 has nice features and decent sound quality for a digital answering machine of this price. It is simple to use and serves its purpose well. After a year of use, however, the machine began fading (unable to distribute power from the cord to the machine) and quickly died. It's now useless."
4,Very efficiant AT&T answering machine.,"For people that just want an ordinary answering machine, this is great. Even though some specific models of this AT&T machine claim that they were rated #1 in sound quality, I did not totally aggree."
1,Noty what I ordered.,"When I placed this order I read it as purchasing the ENTIRE book set. Rather I was sent only one of the books of the set. For what I paid for this ONE book, I went elsewhere to buy the entire book collection for 1/4 of the price here."
3,Ms. Prissy meets Hip/Hop Flavor,This book starts of pretty slow. It does pick up after the second or third chapter. I think this book would really be enjoyed by younger readers. All of the Characters are young and their behavior fits in with the younger crowd. Billie and Jay toy around with alot of different situations that again speaks to the younger generation. Overall I think that the book was well written. Her research was on point and readers got a nice peek into the beauty industry.
3,Only Time Will Tell,"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was a little slow and going to be a bore; however, was I wrong. I was totally surprised, it was a really good book. The writing did hold your attention once the book picked up. The characters were each able to hold there own, they didn't get lost or caught up in the story where you forgot who was who. The main character Billie Burke, is a young African-American beauty editor who hasn't had sex in five years. Then along comes Jay Lane, an up and coming artist and down and dirty street hustler; when the two meet the chemistry between them becomes electrifying. Will they be able to build a relationship and survive the baggage they are carrying around from their past? Only time will tell. (...)"
4,I want a sequel!,I liked this book. I would have preferred more detail on the main characters childhood. I am waiting for more!
3,This book was OK...but just OK...SPOILER,"I didn't necessarily like the author's writing style. It was too ""Billie thinks this, Jay did that."" I think the novel would have worked well as a narrative from the main characters' POVs.I'm so glad at the end that she didn't give up London, because then I would have REALLY hated the book. I'm no feminist, but I have real problems with giving up dreams for men. I'm glad she still decided to go for the short time she needed to.I also feel like the other poster, that the Tammy issues were not resolved.Otherwise, it was decent...I would read another one of her books."
4,"Fun, quick read",I picked this book up at the library and was pleasantly suprised. It was a quick read. Fun and fast paced. The typical good girl meets bad boy with Brooklyn flavor.
4,based on a true story...,"I wrote a review on this great book already. However, I can't help but to wonder if this is based off of a true story??!! hmm, From the few interviews and articles I've read about Tia Williams, it seems as if this book we're loving so much might turn out to be a loosely based autobiography!! something to think about.........."
5,Black Women and Beauty...the Novel,"I loved this book so much! Maybe it thrilled me so much because my dream is to become a beauty editor just like Billie, the main character. This book was great because it showed the side of many black people that we don't get to understand, the sista or brother living a ""white"" life. Billie does struggle being in a world where lots of sistas don't like the fact that she writes about hair, makeup and skincare, because many sistas are into being natural all the time. She takes us on an inside look of the beauty scene, with its promotional parties and luncheons, and the glamour of dressing city chic all the time. Let's not forget that the love story is so down to earth, it feels comforting to read. I recommend this book to sistas and brothas alike!"
3,Billie is fabulous,"Saw the preview in Cosmo and just had to have this book. Loved the story lines going back to each individual characters history, getting to know them personally. Only a couple of sex scenes, but they were hot! Billie is such a strong women with a fabulous life, and Jay, well he is mad hot! Give it a try, new author, hopefully more to come."
5,A Fun Read,"I have recently gotten HOOKED on Mrs. Tia Williams blog site, I picked up her book after reading a few of her blogs. I loved this book! It was a quick Fun read, I loved the way it was written, just like her blogs...witty...funny and full of style/product info!Thanks for the read Tia! :)"
3,It's a block of wood,what do you want for a block of wood rating? It's woody and blocky... does the job.
5,attractive steak knife block,"bought this for my BIL and SIL for christmas since the knives we bought them did not come with a block. It's attractive, doesn't take up too much counter space and holds all eight knives that we bought them."
5,Attractive,"Nice block, looks quite sharp as a holder for the henckels knives that should be purchased at the same time."
3,J.A. Henckels 8-Slot Steak Knife Block,The block is well made and nicely finished. My only problem is that I intend it for a set of Sabatier knives that have a broad blade that does not fit in the slot. I will have to enlarge the slot to suit these knives
5,Absolutely the best.,"If it is Henckels, it is the best I have purchase several knifes sets and butcher blocks, I love them, they make outstanding gifts too.My favorite are the all stainless, they will last a lifetime, the butcher blocks that I purchase are heavy well made, if you purchase the knifes you must have the the block."
5,Love title - buying another for friend,"The title of this book struck me as very funny - a take-off on Hemingway's ""The Old Man and The Sea."" But I didn't know if I'd like the book.It actually is very well written. The plot involves the death of a gay character - and boy is he a character! We find out a lot about him after he's dead. He's outrageous and quite amusing.The San Diego locale is accurately portrayed. The action takes place at an oceanographic institute that seems to be like Scripps Institute.Anyhow, I'm coming back to buy another copy for a friend."
1,What happened to Lee?,"Is this the same guy who wrote the How to Get Anything on Anybody books? It's hard to believe. This book is a complete waste of time. Most of the sources are old and useless. There's no new technology sourced. Nothing on newer stuff like frequency hopping/spread spectrum or SAW oscillators. Nothing even remotely interesting. It reads like a catalog and is one to some extent because some of the devices are sold by (Lapins?) company.Save your money. Get a copy of How to Get Anything on Anybody (book II) or Now Hear This by Winston Arrington, or (maybe) the Basement Buggers Bible. There isn't any new info on this topic. If you are looking for high tech gear for the new millenium, you won't find it. It looks like it's been effectively suppressed by the FBI and congress."
1,A horrible book.,Lee Lapin's How to Get Anything on Anybody books were masterpieces. Buy those instead. This is a waste of money. There are no useful sources inside and Lapin didn't even bother to write much of his old snappy dialogue and witticisms. I am going to return my copy. I'm still waiting for Lee to come out with something like his older books. I'd suggest you pass on this one. Google will give you a better list of sources.
3,Powerful but redundant,"I agree with the other reviewer that this CD is unrelenting in its power and speed. There is a tremendous amount of energy produced by these songs and I liked the Christian-based lyrical content. There is some very nice guitar work on the CD and it's well recorded. The raw power is certainly good fodder to bang your head and if you listen with headphones you can get buried in the sound.Having said all that, it didn't completely work for me. The quick tempo remains consistent throughout and I end up hearing little difference between the songs musically. When it was over I felt like I'd spent an hour listening to the same song over and over."
3,Pentax 8x33 binoculars,"I just received this product from Amazon and immediately took it out in my yard to try it out. I must say that I will try more extensive field use before I make my final decision but so far the optical quality of these glasses disappoints me. I guess there was a good reason why they were marked 50% off. Other Pentax products that friends have shown me impressed me, but not these. I can't help feeling that it's because they were manufactured in China and the Chinese cannot equal the expertise of the Japanese in manufacture of optics. I'd charge about $150. for this product and no more. They are simply not worth it. Some of the features are really nice, like the close focus, lightweight and compact design and the twist out eyecups. Unfortuneately, the optical quality leaves much to be desired."
5,It Works for Me,"This product works perfectly for me. I no longer carry the charger on business trips, I use this cable and charge my Treo 600 using a laptop instead. It synchronizes perfectly with Outlook too. With all due respect for other reviewers I have to recommend this product because it works perfectly for me."
1,Not the best book on the subject,"I was hoping for a really good ruleset on time travel in modern d20, but this book is more about how time travel doesn't work. Very disappointing. Unlike other 3.5 manuals, it doesn't even go in depth, skipping over vast amounts of information, but still being pedantically mystical about the whole thing. Not a good buy as far as I'm concnerned."
1,review,This product was from brilliant store NOT from amazon and it DID NOT work when it got here. Amazon took care of the refund perfectly so Amazon is great but be careful with brilliant store!!!
1,"Does not work, DO NOT BUY!","I bought this from BUYPANDA (Their shipping was fast) but the battery pack won't recharge. It worked with the small charge it came with but when I plug in the cord no lights come on and it doesn't charge. I tried hooking it up to my PC and same thing. There's typos all over the actual box so right off the bat I was suspicious. Also the cord is really loose and is hard to keep in, oh wait that doesn't matter anyways cause it doesn't recharge! Just get the actual Microsoft Play and Charge kit."
1,HONG KONG KNOCK OFF DO NOT BUY!,"I made the same fatal mistake & bought this off of ebay from the same seller selling this on amazon.Typos all over the box,Didn't charge & wow when I emailed the seller,he ADMITED this was a ""High quality knockoff"" from HONG KONG.He refused my money back but Thank you ebay & their fraud dept.Got my $ right back within an hour of sending them his email.DO NOT BUY. THIS IS YET ANOTHER KNOCK OFF ARTIST SELLING ON [...] AND [...].REPORT HIM IMN! & DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK! BUY ONLY ITEMS THAT STATE X-BOX 360 RIGHT ON THE BOX!!!!!"
1,not as long as it said it was,"I purchased this because of the 11 ft cord length, and it turned out to be only about 5-6 feet..... its useless to me"
4,Pretty Good,"for the price you can't beat it, not as good as the real microsoft stuff and the charger cord is sorter just an FYI"
2,"Looks great, unfortunately...",...it spontaneously dispenses soap on the floor without provocation. Sensor is not in sunlight or near traffic--I have been troubleshooting this thing since it was installed in November. It will work fine for weeks at a time and then spill a half-cup of soap on the floor and deplete the batteries. Perhaps a newer version will be more reliable!
4,Great little machine,The carpet extractor worked great. The only problem I encountered was that it leaked a small amount water when parked a while. Cleaning of the dirty water intake could have been made easier. Overall it is a great little machine.Gerald Hill
4,"SO FAR, SO GOOD! A DARN GOOD DESIGN.",This is a pretty decent steamer/scrubber. I really like the compact design for ease of transport and storage. I also like the way the tanks can be removed easily and the whole machine could be cleaned up with little hassle. IT IS REALLY EASY TO USE AND DOES A DECENT CLEANING JOB!
1,absolute junk!,"After only a month after purchasing this, the spray pump stopped working. I exchanged it where I bought it. Not even a year later, it completely stopped working out of the clear blue - no indication whatsoever besides the horrible leaking. The gaskets fell off. The foot pedal broke internally. It is assembled poorly. It is a pain to maintain - clogs easily. Keep in mind I baby'd it the whole time. My only positive comment about this unit is that it folds up very conveniently. But after my experience - and from what I hear from Eureka insiders - I will NEVER buy anything from them again."
1,What a horrible machine!!!!!,"I, unfortunately purchased this lemon at a garage sale and the new appearance should have been the HUGE CLUE!!! I like most everyone else am horrified at the poor performance of this cleaner!! From the very beginning ""pools of water"" (sound familiar?)soaks my carpet and continues to leak when using it or not! I paid $50 so some are saying I got a great deal but I am on total disability due to a stroke 6 yrs. ago so to me that was full price. Disappointed does not come near to how I feel. Replaceing it is just not an option for me, so I am stuck with this nightmare. Just had to vent......Eureka should be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the market!!! No one will ever convince me that they were unaware of this non-sucking,leaking like a sieve,lousy performing piece of cow dung!!!!"
1,Complete Nightmare,At first I was happy because of the folding up part. But almost from the start I notice constant pooling of water. I had to keep a mop near by and always park it on flooring not carpets. Then out of the blue the sprayer stopped working. There are no diagrams about where the nozzles are located. 3 different vacuum repair depots refused to work on them because of the trouble these maachines have had. Don't buy Eureka anything!!!!!!
1,Do you like wet carpet and mold?,"It's funny that the word ""Extractor"" is in the title because that is where this device fails. It leaves too much water in the carpet. I used it in a 12x12 dorm room and it took days to dry (even with windows open to allow for more ventilation). In addition, all that excess moisture during the summer caused my room to smell like mold for weeks. I tried going over the carpet several times, I adjusted the plastic cover and settings but nothing worked. In the end I sent it back for a refund and ended up purchasing a cheaper carpet cleaner from a local department store."
1,carpet cleaner,I hate this product. It doesn't clean well at all. I had a much cheaper unit made by another manufacturer and it was much better. It seems very flimsy and it also leaks.
5,Great shampooer!,"I bought the Atlantis Carpet Cleaner when we were moving from our apartment of 2 years to our house. Our lease stated we needed to thoroughly shampoo the carpets (most likely several times) in order to get a return of our deposit. I used the Atlantis one time to get perfectly clean carpets without much moisture left in them. The step attachment is fabulous. Because of the Atlantis, our carpets were left cleaner than when we moved in two years prior."
2,Great to store but doesn't suck up!,"I actually had to go out and rent a Rug Docotr to extract the water out of my carpet that the Atlantis left behind! I tried several different things, including calling Eureka. Apparently, that is just how it is. When the fresh water tank is empty, I have a quarter tank of dirty water! As far as cleaning, I honestly think my Hoover did a better job. All that is really nice about this machine is it's light and easy to store."
2,Powerful but....,"It folds down neatly and pretty powerful suction. However, the seals of both water and cleanser dispensers are badly designed. They leak and leaves a pool of liquid under the machine. Everytime the water/soap tank is removed, water will drip and pool around the base of the unit. Never leave unused water or soap for it'll just drip and ruin your carpet/wood floor."
1,Not so good,We also bought this cleaner and thought it worked ok when we first started. The soap that went with it left a horrible residue on the carpets that attracted dirt only a day or so after. The tanks LEAK!! EVERYWHERE!! They leave huge puddles on the floor. The soap dispenser cracked and it is the part that comes off the machine the least. It leaves behind tons of water in the carpet and the hand tools are a joke. Don't make the same mistake try a different brand instead.
1,It leaks more than it cleans,We bought the edition prior to the one with the fold down handle. We had it serviced twice for the leaky seals that just made pools of water on the floor. We can't even use it. I cannot recommend it based on the poor design of the seals.
2,"Powerful, but weak","I have kids and dogs and use my scrubber a lot. I owned several hoovers, a couple of Bissells and ended up with the Eureka. I was very impressed with the suction power of the machine, it worked better than all of the others I had owned. After 2 weeks, the cheesy handle wouldn't stay upright, so I exchanged it and the same thing happened a week later, but ended up dealing with it. I still use it regularly, but have replaced the gaskets between the tanks and the machine portion twice, the handle is almost non existent, the separate solution tank leaks all over the floor and the brushes quick working. Not a very old machine for all of the problems."
4,the book is very useful,"the book is very useful, And was in very good condition I like it - A little old but it's possible to use"
3,A good look at RFK from a collegue perspective,"This book is a good book in the aspect that if gives you an insight from some who worked for and with RFK closely and who has als oremained true friend even after his death. The book was a little slow in some parts and had alot of paragrahs taken from RFK's book that he wrote In His Own Words but picked back up with drafts of some speeches given and not given for some reason or another. Will for sure by this book because it didn't have some reallly nice quotes, good stories, honest insite and is generally a good book to add to my Kennedy Collection."
3,dimensions are perfect,size is perfect for my new bed. slides well and for the past 1 month it as been holding up well. as others have stated the plastic is not that sturdy and i am uncertain if it will last.
4,Very Good for the Price,"I found these great for storing gift wrap rolls under my bed. They aren't the most sturdy but with only 5"" of clearance, they will fit just fine."
2,disappointed,Was a little bit disappointed with this product. Found that I couldhave purchased one even larger for less in price. The colors on thedominoes are too much alike. Makes it hard to play because of this.They are durable....and the case is nice..but was disappointed forthe above reasons.
4,Love these dominoes,"I bought these dominoes to help my 7 year old daughter with addition and subtraction. We love to play with them and she can easily practice all her single digit addition and subtraction problems.The great thing about these dominoes is that my 3 year old can also play because they are color-coded. How cool is that? He is learning his colors and she is learning her math. A double duty teaching toy.Also, they are a lot of fun just to handle and look at because of the fun colors and the sturdiness of their design. I would definitely buy these again"
4,A good basic comprhensive look at sharks.,"This is a very interesting book. I liked the way the authors structured the information in the for of answers to some basic questions people have about sharks. If I had any complaints it would be about the shortage of color pictures. Also all the color pictures were inserted as plates into a 12 page section of the book, instead of over the whole book. Even with that complaint I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in sharks."
3,"Fits As Required, But Made In China","I thought all Purolator products were made in USA, but apparently most transmission filters are made in China. The one I took out was an ATP I think, and it had ""Made in USA"" stamped on it, was a little disappointed that this one came from China.I would assume this is no better, or worse, than most other transmission filters."
3,meh,this album has some good music but the vocals really piss me off.....they have no range and are just annoying. other than that the album is pretty good. not the best but ok
4,HOW DID I MISS THESE GUYS BACK IN THE DAY???,"I'm very impressed with Xentrix!!! I own their first two CDs and love them both. Good, solid thrash metal. Haven't heard their last two CDs (Kin and Scourge) yet, but I've heard they are different. Anyway, the first two (and especially For Whose Advantage) are solid efforts! And they have all their EP stuff on their first two re-releases."
2,Metalliclones,I have this tape from back in the day. UK Thrash they say. I say total Metallica rip off band. I'm sorry but these guys never stood out. I found this tape the other day and popped it into a tape player (who has one nowadays!?) and it brought back memories of when i was a kid. but it also brought back mems of how i didn't like this band very much. Some of the riffs are waaaay to close to Metallica. You can pass on this rare item as it offers nothing special.
3,"O.K., but not what I expected","I was very excited to read this book, it looked like an excellent compilation of interesting research from a wide range of fields. However, I was dissappointed by the contents. Most chapters are just reviews of the general research of the authors, and some hardly address the idea of intelligence and culture. Some authors spend the whole chapter just reviewing their research, and then in the last paragraph run over their thoughts on if there is intelligence or culture in their study species in just a few sentences. Having said that, some chapters are golden and well worth the read. Because this book is relatively cheap for a science book, I would say that the few insightful chapters make it worth the cost, but overall it was not as informative or interesting as I had hoped."
4,A good book to read before heading up.,"The AAC Guides made this required reading for us before making a summit attempt. When focussing on climbing, what risks others are taking etc. you can become impatient and foolhardy. Others died when we were on the mountain, but luckily we made it safely to the top."
5,"Great product, but...","I've had my MD player for about 2 and a half years. It has been mostly reliable throughout these years. The remote clip broke off about 6 months ago, which is no big deal, and the jog dial has been working on and off for the past year. Two unnecessary but very helpful functions. Recently, I went to switch discs, and it would not come out. The front part seems to be caved in. I am going to try to fix it, but I'm not sure if I can. I've used it quite a bit, and I have been extremely happy with it. However, it is quite large and is kind of annoying to record from the internet and anywhere else. I suggest this product if you do not mind the heavier and bigger player, but other wise it's great. I would maybe suggest a newer MDLP recorder that can record much more onto a disc. Good luck!"
5,Great player,"great player. only drawbacks are its size, not as small as more expensive ones, and that it doesn't have a USB link for downloading MP3s, you have to attatch it to a easy to find 2 way analog cable.plus the directions are a bit sketchy, have to just use some logic. but besides those minor faults this item is a great buy for people who enjoy listing to their own mixes. or for people who just want to show off."
1,MOST WANT TO HEAR ONLY PLESeaNT REviews BUT im HONEST,"I have had this mini disc player for ... oh.. 4 months. It was really great the first 2 weeks. Everyone likes its the first couple weeks. BUt, like most people say, for ... it is to big, lumbersome, and not that convienent. The dial is easily moved accidently, inorder to record a song, you have to play the entire song. UNliKE ! the sony mini disc, it is big and cant compress files. THe sony can compress files and make the mini disc hold up to 80 songs!!! while the sharp holds 15. Im not saying this isnt a good mini disc, im saying that for the price, look around to see what else you can get that is smaller,lighter, and more functtions. I mean this mp3 player is bigger and heavier than my hold cs player!"
4,Sharp definitely sounds the best!,"I was all ready to buy the Aiwa, based on favorable reviews I had read. But I decided to take a trip to Circuit City and actually listen for myself. Now I really wanted to buy the Aiwa, it is so much prettier design-wise than its competition. But after listening, I have to say the Sharp sounds so much better than the Sony and the Aiwa! I was amazed at the obvious difference. I am not thrilled with the interface on the Sharps, or their thickness or headphones, but all the plusses of this unit definitely outweigh the negatives. And as far as sound quality (loudness, clarity, bass), the others don't compare. I just wish they would improve the physical design and include better quality headphones."
5,WOW WOW WOW,"This is one heck of a Ching Chong Rubber Ding Dong machine. It works like a charm and has everything you want. To tell you the trueth, I've already wrote a review for this model, Im one of the people down there, you'll probably read my article. But I wrote that when I first got the 722 and now I know more than I did then. So I created a site for it. I posted it once and amazon took it down. I posted it again and Amazon took it down again! So now Im using another username and you can see the site address in my profile. Click that see more about me link above this paragraph. YOU WILL NEVER REGRET BUYING THIS UNIT!"
3,Fairly good product...,"I bought the Sharp 722 last April (1999) or so and I've had several problems with it. First, the headphones broke (a little tape fixed that). Then someone dropped it or something and the discs wouldn't eject after that. I took it to the place I bought it to get it fixed and it was going to cost $120! Since it was already messed up, and I'm pretty good with electronics, I decided to crack it open (not literally, of course. I carefully unscrewed it) and tryed to fix it myself. It probably voided the warrenty but that didn't matter since it didn't cover the damage anyway. It turns out that the top of the slot was bent down so I just bent it back up. I also fixed the remote wire cause it was coming apart. Also, the jog dial doesn't work sometimes. To fix that I just start spinning the dial around really fast and after about 20 spins it starts working again. Anyway, thats my story and now it works fine. Its easy to use and has many cool features and accesories."
1,Corrupted TOC and would no longer play MD,"After recording an MD, I entered the track information with the nice Jog Dial of the 722. When finished, I hit stop so the TOC would write to the MD, but got an error. The MD would not work within the 722 any more. When I tried it in a different MD player, it worked fine, but the 722 just showed a TOC error.I have no idea how good the product is in general, but it gets only one star for how it worked for me. The one star is because it didn't destroy the MD beyond use on another player, but the 722 sure couldn't handle the disc any more."
1,Very Heavy,I got this mini disc player and it was extremely heavy! go with on that is a little lighter. I would walk along the street and it would sag in my pocket.
3,Too Big,"Its a great sounding, great working mini disk player, but get ready, its a big one, the largest I have seen yet. Sturdy though and works well just bigger than average."
4,Pretty Good,"It sounds damn good, good batt life, ok remote, too thick for an MD player, jog dial is nice."
1,worst product I've had yet,"this MD broke down on me in the first month of use. Then SHARP didn't get me a replacment for three months. THEN, when I got the replacment, it broke down in one month again. SHARP WON'T refund it's customers for bad products so now I wait to recieve my third 722 MD which will probably break again... STAY AWAY FROM SHARP>>> their customer service is HORRIBLE"
5,great product,"I bought one of these off ebay a while back. I've had it for almost a year now and it's worked great. I don't care for the remote much I think that's a silly idea and not very useful. It's also very tough, i've dropped hard enough to get dents and it still works. It had a glitch reading an MD one time, but i haven't been able to get it to repeat. I've gotten in a wreck with this thing and it didn't even skip. The sound reproduction is.. well, what you'd expect from any minidisc player, awesome. The batteries last a long time, i've take it on long trips and never had them run out on me. I've gone weeks without recharging it. The jog dial is sooo useful.The thing i like best about it though is the expressions on peopels' faces when they see it. It's a very novel design, very different and interesting. I've been very happy with mine."
4,MD-MS722,"This is a really good minidisc recorder/player. It is very easy to use and has awesome Bass. It is expensive compared to portable CD players but it is a million times better. It is smaller, lighter and much easier to carry all of your favorite songs. With a portable CD player you need to carry the player and your collection of CDs. With the MD-MS722 you just carry the small player and two or three minidiscs. I only give this MiniDisc player 4 stars because it comes with cables that you cannot hook up to many music sources. I had to buy an additional cable. But still, this MD is awesome."
2,all the problems,i have this product and it was the most worthless thing i have bought the remote cracked while i was out at the boat and it also wouldn't record after the fist year . not the best produst but it has a great look
4,Good for discussion starters!,"The screwtape letters study guide is actually many white pages that are photocopied and come inside a flimsy folder. This is why I was surprised at the price I paid for it, because I felt that it was overpriced. On that note I planned on using this guide to help me map out a book study that I am leading and there are some very good questions that spark great discussions, however, there are also some ""worksheets"" and busy work type of material that are unnecessary unless you are teaching this in a classroom setting. Overall the questions in this product are very good and I don't regret buying it, I just wish it wouldn't have been so expensive or that it would come in a nicer binding!"
4,Written for high schoolers but challenging for adults,The study guide is helping me formulate the wiles and schemes of our ememy. Some of which I would surely miss w/o the questions. Fortunately there is an answer guide. Well done.
4,Good Study Guide With An Academic Bent,"I'm using this Study Guide with my Small Group Bible Study, and it is working well for us.However, the Guide is written to be used in more of an academic setting and the vocabulary exercises and questions reflect that to some degree.That said, though, the questions are thought-provoking and generate good discussion within the group.This Guide is definitely worth the cost."
4,QUITE AN AFFORDABLE ASSET!,"Of course, no single book can claim to have completely dealt with all the common mistakes English learners and speakers make, but this one did a good job in that light. It is effective in tackling grammatical errors: whether subject-verb agreement or complex tense use. It also prescribes when to use active or passive report.Students can use this book as a self-study companion. It provided rich and varied approach to grammatical applications. Generous focus was given to all the parts-of-speech, as well as to a variety of phrasal verbs.In a nutshell, this is a useful book for both learners and advanced native speakers. Its low price and emphases on contemporary vocabulary would be welcomed by all. Call it an affordable asset!"
4,"A Personable Baby Boy, A Personable Book","""Hello, Aibek"" was a delight to read, becoming more delightful with each turn of the page. Even though I knew the ending - of course, Aibek is pictured on the cover - I found myself turning the pages as if it were a novel, wanting to see how it all played out. Mr. Quirk has a charmingly personable way of speaking about his and his wife's experience throughout the adoption process. As well, he includes the things about the experience that prospective parents truly want to know, aside from the information given to parents by the adoption agencies. I would recommend it to those considering international adoption, and to those just wanting to read a heart-warming story."
4,Hello Aibek! ..all the info and lots of emotion...,"Hello Aibek! A Journey of International Adoption is more than a handbook. It is a personal, fun adventure story filled with emotion. It is well written and interesting even for those who may just be starting to consider an international adoption.It captures the joys and difficulties of the process and made me feel like I was on the journey with them.Nice work."
2,Hello Aibek,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I adopted a daughter from the same orphanage in Kazakhstan and it was so touching to read of a very similar experience, in print! I felt it was well written and a great read."
1,Stay to the end of the credits to hear the Goldsmith original theme!,"It is interesting how, unlike in the score for the original Omen (1976), the music for the 2006 remake has absolutely NO presence. The score is remarkably unmemorable and adds very little to the ambience of the movie. The original 1976 theme is rescored for the SECOND half of the end credits -- which brings chills to my spine.Its TOO bad that by the time the Jerry Goldsmith theme is heard, most people not expecting it have all ready walked out of the theater. Hint: If you are going to watch the remake, stay until the end credits is finished to enjoy the glorious Goldsmith score!"
4,"Great product, as described.","Great product for a large neck- goes up to 20"". Ties snugly. Nice color and high quality. There is nothing over the top amazing about it, but it is as descibed and well made."
2,Not Great Stereo,"Unlike most new Aiwa's I've seen or purchased, this particular stereo seemed to be way out of date. The buttons were hard to push, and the remote was almost useless. The sound was decent, but for the money, I wouldn't recommend buying this stereo."
1,Item not as described,"I purchased ""Source Naturals Wellness Elderberry Liquid Extract, 4 Ounce (Pack of 2)"" that was fulfilled by the Vitamin Shoppe. It is described as a ""Two pack"" of 4 ounce bottles in the title and elsewhere in the product description. I paid for the ""two pack"" but only received one. When I tried to correct the problem through the Amazon site I was informed that my only option was to return the item. Unfortunately, my sister in law (the recipient) had already opened the bottle. Not being able to find a way to communicate with anyone at Amazon to approve a refund or to correct the product description, I decided to take the loss and be more skeptical of multi-pack item purchases in the future. I also decided to avoid purchasing items at Amazon that are not fulfilled by Amazon. Attempts to address the issue with the Vitamin Shoppe went no where."
3,"Light and Small, but not very sturdy","I've owned Nikons all my life, so maybe my standards are too high, but this camera has some problems. The camera I purchased came with an artistic condition called ""Light leak"", which puts a beautiful white arc on some of the pictures. It also takes very, very blue pictures. The shots look great on an island, but not in the snow. My boyfriend used this camera and I used my own Nikon to take the same shots, and his were much bluer. We both used Kodak film and got it developed at the same place. I also agree with the flimsy comment down below, and I don't understand how Olympus can claim this is a water resistant camera, if light is getting through to the film it can't be air-tight. Despite the drawbacks, it is the smallest and lightest 35mm camera I have ever seen. The slide-across lens cover is great, b/c it means you don't need a case for the camera. I'll be buying another one to replace this broken one, and hoping for the best."
3,An idea that suffers from its own success,"The idea of using VR for recreations of combat in the middle ages is superb. (This is probably a dream of most SF/fantasy readers, or at least it will be after you read this book!).Unfortunately the quest that forms a major plot line fails to excite precisely because it is taking place in a safe artificial world (and hacked one at that.)Still this book has a great set of ideas which, together with some very nice historical touches, makes the book a pleasant way to pass the time. Also a lot of potential exists for other stories based on the use of VR for historical re-enactment.Overall a fairly good read but one which fails to live up to its potential."
4,"Fast-paced, well-written book of VR and the Middle Ages","If you're a fan of virtual reality, the Middle Ages and chase scenes, get this book--you won't be disappointed. The characters are a little thin and the future world is generic, but the mystery and cleverness of the central plot carries the book along."
1,Boring fantasy,"A book that role playing gamers will probably enjoy. Terms I hadn't heard since I was 16 playing Dungeons and Dragons; hit points, lawful good, etc. I was expecting a mystery/adventure plot, but got a fantasy adventure. Because the main action takes place in virtual reality, I failed to see the urgency of the characters situation. Couldn't they make their world whatever they wanted? Unlike other VR novels where people could die if you died in VR. Not the case here. The main characters spend there time killing virtual dragons, trolls, loch ness monsters, evil elves and harpies. I found all this very boring. I think only teenagers and preteens would enjoy this book. Most adults I think would find it boring. Hence only a one star for me."
2,Reality,"This book has lots of college essays that could be used for reference when writing an college essay. However, it's too concentrated on Ivy League schools and not other competitive schools. The comments that are suppose to be reviewed by college counselors and admissions officers are poor. Most of them just explains that they are creative. It does not comment much on how the author should redo or learn from their mistakes and do this thing. Not as informative as they claim to be."
2,"Example Essays Helpful, But Better Resources Are Out There","While the example admissions essays in this book are plentiful, I found only one or two of the essays in the book actually helpful for me. I spent (read: wasted) a lot of time digging through many of the essays in this book that just did not resonate with me at all. Resources like Acceptional.com are much more helpful for finding specific example essays that can help you craft your own essay."
3,Dissapointing - No drummer.....!!,"For me this is DVD is a big dissapointment. Sting uses programmed backing tracks for drums (instead of a live drummer). The absense of a live drummer for me is a missing ingredient from the recipe of what is usually a great musically and visually entertaining show. As a drummer myself I was a bit dismayed to hear Sting utter the words that ""Drums get in the way of the music/song""....!! The quality of the recording is of the usual extremely good standard but had I known in advance from a review (or even from the DVD cover) that a live drummer was nowhere to be seen (or heard) I probably would not have even purchased this DVD - for you drummers out there there's no Manu or Vinnie on this one.....!!"
3,Not his best,"I am a fan of Sting, but this is not one of my personal favorites. If you are only going to buy one or two of his DVDs, keep looking."
5,Code Name EXTREME PREJUDICE,"Code Name extreme prejudice.It is A sus pence of drugs,sex slaves & a presedential candidate.the code name teamhas many close encounters.Extreme Prejudice By William johnstone is very well written&keeps; you reading more."
1,"Has Lead, Lowe's does not care","This toy does contain lead, to my shock. Further, Lowe's customer care just verified the issue and didn't seem concerned that they carried the product. I returned it."
1,Big mistake on this release,"This release has a big mistake. The songs that this CD contains are the nine tracks from ""Vision of misery"" album + 2 bonus tracks instead of the eleven of the original album."
4,Useful for researchers,"This book has a lot of details and information including useful reference intervals. Although it is very useful, it may be more useful for researchers than practicing veterinarians due to the fact that it is extremely detailed."
2,THAT DREADED UTOC ERROR,"I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NOW THAT I CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO,I AM THE IST ON THE BLOCK TO TRY OUT NEW STUFF;SO IMAGINE MY DISSAPPOINTMENT AND EMBARRASSMENT WHEN AFTER A WEEK OF PROUDLY SHOWING OFF MY SHARP MD-MS701H MINIDISC PLAYER THAT DREADED UTOC ERROR SHOWED UP AND WOULDN'T GO AWAY.I'M NOW OFF TO GET AN MD-MT821;HOPE IT GOES BETTER!"
1,TOC ERROR,This mini disc player served me well for about a year and then I started to get repeated TOC ERRORS. I checked online and it is a common problem with the sharp mini disc players. I can no longer use mine and I am trying to get Sharp to replace the one I currently have. You should probably spend a few more dollars and buy the Sony models. Sony invented the mini disc player and their players are much more reliable.
4,"Best Sounding, Great Value","I bought my 702 when I was in NYC and haven't had any problems yet in the last 2 months. MD is an awesome format. I record music from MP3's onto MD. I debated between a MP3 player and a MD player for about a month. The main thing that swayed me toward the MD player was being able to change the discs. Most MP3 players are limited to 64megs, and the memory is so darn expensive! So far I have recorded approx. 400megs worth of mp3's on my MD player. The only thing that I don't like about my MD player is the way you have to name the tracks. It gets very tiresome in just a few minutes when your pushing a button rather than a jog dial. Oh.. the only other thing that I wish it had was an optical output. But i havent seen one on any of the portable models. Maybe sometime in the future? In a nutshell if your looking for a great MiniDisc player that acually sounds better than the rest, go with Sharp."
3,"Great gizmo, but will it last?","I got my MS-702 last summer. I love it! The sound quality is really good, and it has been pretty reliable. There are a few squawks I have though. The UTOC (Unable Table of Contents, like the directory on a computer disk)that some the others have experienced has only happened to me using sony discs. I use Memorex now, never have that problem. The battery seems to be running shorter. I didnt think lithium-ion developed a memory. Replacement Li is expensive. I got the external AA pack and car power cord. They last longer, but the car power cord wont charge the Li battery. I wish there were a bigger selection of pre-recorded music available. Im not sure if the MD has what it takes to avoid being the betamax recorder of the 90's. its been around for a long time but hasn't seemd to really catch on yet. We'll see."
1,Where's the zero stars selection?,"I gave this unit a try and ended up very disappointed (see other one star rating). Without much invested in research and development, Sharp can afford to sell their recorders so cheap. I returned my non-recordable minidisc recorder for Sharp's next in line, the MD-MT15(s) and instead of quitting on me after only 3 days, it went an entire week before the dreaded ""UTOC ERROR"" showed up and erased my music! If you record a CD straight through, without interruption, it works great. Try to mix your own, and it just chokes. The result? I returned to the store again, and to avoid losing a customer, they agreed to replace my defunct Sharp players for a comparable Sony, even if a comparable Sony is more than $50 more! My recommendation, stick with the original until the rest catch up, even if you have to pay more."
4,Better than an Mp3 player,An Mp3 player can only hold a few hours of music at the most.But this minidisk player with the right adapter can hold unlimited Mp3 music with great sound.The Optical Digital Input included in this has unbelievable sound.Better than CD sound.The analog has ok sound.It takes a little time to write the name of the songs in this because this Minidisk player does not have a Jog-Dial in it.Other than that this Minidisk player is great.P.S. It also has rechargeable batteries included in it.
5,The Minidisc Revolution,"This minidisc recorder is in a class of it's own. At only 169.99* it can be seen as a very worthwhile investment into the future. With crystal clear recordings, smooth polished playing, and many functions which can make the user feel at ease, the minidisc is ideal for any long plane, train or car trip, or indeed, to use during that 10min stroll through the park.Eventually minidiscs will take over the audio world, due to their small size, ease of transport, and crystal clear audio tracks. Unlike the cassette, the discs never ware out, and so, memories can be recorded, for ever, without fear that they will ware out. They can also withstand an awful lot of shaking, and shock, therefore making it, for the first time possible to listen to what ever you want, going through turbulence, or heading down that bumpy highway, and into the future.Colm Mac Eochagáin*Correct at time of writing"
2,MD's in your car,"I'm still shopping for a portable MD player, and appreciate all the reviews here. I own an AIWA shelf 3CD/5MD/Tuner recorder that was available here last year, and with which I am totally satisfied. If you can afford it, I HIGHLY recommend the SONY MDX-65 MD changer for your car. It requires a compatible SONY in-dash unit to control the changer, and you can select from radio, radio/cassette, and radio/CD. The changer is in my glove box and requiring no magazine, five MD's may be changed while a sixth is playing."
5,My first minidisc,My first minidisc player is the only portable I've ever bought. No skips while jogging and I can edit discs on the fly after I've recorded them from a CD player using the optical input cable.
4,I am very happy to have my MD-MS702MK.,"I bought it last year [1998] by mail order. Since then I have had only one problem. Once, during optical recording, a message DEFECT appeared. It is hard to say what was the reason of it, cause I have never seen it after that. I use MD702 every day at least few hours. I have already recorded about thirty discs from other CDs. Sound quality is good, features also. I have never come across U TO ERROR yet! I strongly recommend replacing headphones to take a full advantage of MD sound. I bought Grado SR-60 and these are perfect-match to my 702. The sound is awesome! What makes me obviously even happier."
1,Grrrr. I'm not a happy camper.,"My brother convinced me that spending this much money was worth it. NOt on this one. It said it was recording, said it had recorded, but did not record. I followed every little instruction perfectly, still didn't work. Returned it for my refund. At least I'll go and see if a different company (not Sharp) can make one that works."
1,DO NOT EVER BUY THIS JUNK...,"My only star??......The MD looks. It's nice...really nice...If you buy it, the player looks will be the most important item, as in no time -and I mean NO TIME-, when this little-nice & cute device stops recording/editing and dies...""UTOC ERROR, a famous one""...you will have it as a shelf-decoration. Go for a Sony, or you'll regret it."
2,Good sound....if it WORKS!,"I've had 2 of these. The 1st one got the UTOC error after 2 months. Up until then, it was pretty good. Great sound, but sometimes if I walked with it in my jacket pocket, it would skip eventually. After the UTOC error, I got it replaced and within ONE MONTH, I got the same error! I can't recommend this unit and I think it's been discontinued."
4,"Good product, but is it worth the price?","Bought one of these and owned it for about a month. It's a lot of fun and puts out great sound, but for $300 is it worth it? You can find it now for $249 and get a $50 rebate coupon from Sharp which will bring you down to $199, but you'll need an extended warranty (a.k.a. blackmail payment) from where-ever you buy it. Like oters have said...this thing will be pre-historic in two years. And if you pay the blackmail up front you can trade it in for a new model in a year or so. (At least that's the case at Best Buy) If you want to learn more about minidisc stuff check out minidisco.com it has links to lots of MD info. Personally I took mine back and will probably end up with a CD recorder. The prices should be about the same next year, and who has a tape deck in their car anymore? The only way you'll be able to play the MD in your car is with the tape adaptor, and it seems everybody these days has a CD player in the car. Then what do you do?"
3,Bottle leaks,"I had been wanting this for a while now so I was really excited to get it only to be dissapointed after I opened the box. The spray nozzle does not work so when the perfume comes out of the sprayer it just trickles down the sides of the bottle leaving the bottle all wet and no fragrance on me except my hands witch are also wet from holding the bottle. Also even after wiping down the bottle with a towel it left a puddle on my perfume tray. Needless to say I threw it in the trash, what a mess and waste of money. I do like this fragrance and will buy my next one in a bricks and mortar store."
3,It's ok,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She had tried Shine and Charms in the previous years. She said it was ""ok"" but her favorite is Incanto Shine."
3,"very subtle smell, not as enchanting as In canto Charms","After purchasing this perfume, i realized how much better the Incanto Chrams perfume smells. This smells great, don't get me wrong, but Incanto Charms simply can not e topped. i have smelt scents similar to incanto Dream, but nothing can compare to the fruity exotic smell of Incanto Charms, i just with the smell wouldn't wear off so quickly!"
1,No grill and out $15.00,"This product arrived broken, so I returned it and paid about $15.00 in shipping costs. They told me they didn't have any more in stock, so I have no grill and I'm out $15.00. This makes me very frustrated ordering things online! The only reason I'm giving this vendor one star is because he quickly contacted me and said he was sorry I'd already returned the grill, but he did not pay for the return shipping of the item."
1,Worst Game I ever played,"To put it bluntly, this game sucks. When I spent a hour trying to get past the part on the boat (by hitting the X and Y buttons) I just took the game out and threw it away. I'm glad I only spent $20 for this piece of crap. I never thought that something that only consists of 2 buttons would make me give up so easily. Don't waste your time and money on this. There are things far better to blow your hard earned cash on."
1,Did not get the correct order,"Amazon tricked me with this cologne, they advertised Ted by Ted Lapidus,which i used once before and was impressed with the scent, instead they sent me a bottle of LAPIDUS, which i had already in my collection at a cheaper price i got elsewhere. I just felt like i was duped big time with this purchase."
5,This alone is worth the price of an all-region player,"We love him in ""Black Books"" and ""Spaced,"" but stand up is Bill Bailey's forte. His are the funniest concert films I've ever seen, and Part Troll is his best. I have yet to show this or his other DVDs to anyone (a couple dozen people so far) who didn't almost bust a gut laughing.This and Bill Bailey's other DVD's are available new from Amazon UK in a nice box set."
3,Palm Treo 600 Side Case w/Snap + Swivel Belt Clip,"This item is just-over-the-limit when it comes to practicality if you use the Wireless Phone feature on the Treo 600 very much. This is because the case muffles the phone ringer to where you miss your calls. And even if you DO hear it ring, by the time you get it out of the case, it has stopped ringing by then! Plus that, it is very bulky, heavy, and encumbersome to wear....and also manage to keep your pants up! On more of a positive note, this side case DOES make it easier to keep your programs & SD memory cards all together with a mini notepad & pen with your Palm Treo."
3,"Great case, but after a while the snap isn't so secure.","This is one of the best belt cases for the Treo I've come across.The big problem is that after a while, the snap strap that keeps the phone in the case can easily unsnap. The newer cases that have straps that cover the entire opening seem to resolve this problem in my experience."
3,keep it in perspective,"The first question one should ask is why do I watch or buy these movies? I am constantly amazed at people who review a movie like this and are apalled it isn't the ""English Patient"". Watched in its perspective, Deadly Outbreak is an enjoyable movie. Jeff Speakman's acting has improved ( he holds his own) and he does more Kenpo in this movie than he has in years. Its very reminiscent of the films Cannon used to put out back in the 80's, but the effects are good. Having an actor of note, Ron Silver, in the movie helps, although I wonder if SIlver has ever turned a role down. I know why Jef Speakman is int hemoive but why is Ron Silver?"
4,Beautiful and sturdy,"I wish they still made this series in ivory but, hey, every piece is sturdy and beautiful!"
5,Best Bird Feeder,I have had this feeder for three years now and it is the best. Liked it so much I now have two. Still looks good and lots of room for birds. They really seem to prefer the round style. I think this set up with the bottom feed holes is the best.
2,"Great feeder, but one big design flaw...","For the first month or so, I really liked this feeder. It holds a lot of seed and the birds accepted it immediately.The problem lies in the refilling mechanism. There is a plastic-covered braided steel wire that runs through the center of the feeder. The 'top plate' slides up and down on this wire, and is secured in the 'down' position by a spring-loaded clamp that pinches the wire to hold the top plate in place. To refill the feeder, you squeeze this clamp to release it, and slide the top plate up so you can pour seed into the feeder.Within a month of use, this spring-loaded clamp had cut through the plastic sheath around the steel wire, and the plastic shreds are apparently jammed in the clamp. I can no longer slide the top plate up on the wire, so I can no longer open the feeder to refill it. Either the steel wire should not be covered in plastic, or the clamping mechanism should be 'gentler' so it does not cut through the plastic."
2,Seeds don't dispense,"Even with the smallest seeds (millet), the seeds don't dispense into the tray and I have to jiggle the feeder throughout the day to get the seeds out. The birds don't seem to be able to release the seeds by pecking at the holes.The cord frayed so I cannot get the lid off more than a bit -- can't refill easily. The bottom detaches when I don't want it to detach.I would not buy this again."
3,Nice feeder but not Squirrel-Proof!,"Nice bird feeder, but the squirrels finally figured-out how to climb onto it and steal the seed! They walk across the bar that we've suspended the feeder from, and then climb onto the feeder and scare all the birds away while hogging-up all the seed. When the squirrels aren't around, the Chickadees happily feed on both levels simultaneously, and they feed from all sides. The continuous circular perches make it easy for the birds to sit on. We laugh because we almost need a control tower to control all the bird traffic! It is easy to fill as well. The top keeps the seed dry and shelters the feeding areas. We live in a rainy climate and the seed stays dry. If it weren't for the squirrels, I would give this feeder five stars!"
3,Just Sits Without Birds,"I needed another feeder as my other one has only 6 ports and the birds were fighting to make room. I purchased this one from reading other reviews. The feeder is beside the other on a double shepherds hook but they don't visit it at all. The squirrels don't get into it either so I guess that is good thing. I am a little disappointed, but too late now. I can't recommend it either way. Maybe some day they might use it. The feeding tray itself is very small and that might work for small birds which I do have a lot of sparrows. Just doesn't turn their crank."
5,Birds seem to like it...,"I won't rave about this as some have, but the birds (finches and sparrows) appear to like it. I like it because I don't have to fill it as often as I do my other tube-type feeder. I've seen as many as 9 birds on this feeder at the same time, with room for more. It's a very good product."
3,Clogs up and you have to shake it,"It is a nice feeder, but it does clog fairly easily. The birds hardly used it until I figured out why - the seeds don't run into the tray without shaking them down. It would be better if the cover were a little bigger so the rain won't get into the trays."
3,not so squirrel proof,The birds and the squirrels love the feeder. It is NOT squirrel-proof. Very disappointed. Nice feeder but not as advertised.
3,Birdscape 325 is NOT squirrel proof,"I bought this feeder to bring more birds into our yard. The unit performs quite nicely and is attractive and modern in appearance.The birds, once they found it are using it nearly all day. So is a squirrel! I have the feeder supported on a shepherds crook near a window for viewing the variety of birds that come to feast. But a resourceful squirrel has found the ability to scoot up the shepherds crook and balance himself on the feeder, enjoying the birds' food mix. I will take care of the squirrel's food as I look for a way to keep him fed as well without chasing the birds away. Birdscapes needs to modify and re-test this unit, OR take away the ""squirrel proof"" moniker.Gene Pedrazzoli"
1,Less than satisfactory,"This feeder clogs daily and requires manual clearing of peanuts, corn, and sunflower seeds: hardly what one would expect from a good quality bird feeder."
3,Perfect size and shape,Perfect size and shape as a creamer/milk pitcher and for serving homemade vinaigrettes and dressings.Amazon seems to offer 2nds so peel the Emile Henry Label off to check if there's a defect under it. I received some with holes/divots & chips under the Emile Henry Sticker.
3,Atlantic 24 CD Case.,"The outside of the case is very cool and durable, though the inside is just ok. First, the lock that holds the case closed is plastic. Second, after you fill it up, the last four cd holders are a little delicate to go through them because it does not go all the way to the left. And third, when you need to get one cd out of it there is no other way but to put the tip of one finger on the readable part of the cd to pull it out."
2,Yawn,"I'd say that of the over 300 pages of words filling Mitchell's book, there are maybe 10 or 15 pages that are worth reading. The rest is soporific material to be injested as a sleeping aid right before bedtime.Mitchell managed to make an intrinsically exciting story dull in the mere act of reporting on it. Still, I give her credit for making a go of it. Better to try and fail than not try at all. The people I disrespect the most are those who provided the blurbs to the powers-that-be at Hyperion. While it's a common thing to do, I think if any of these book-jacket-name-lenders had actually read Mitchell's book, they would have politely declined to deposit favors in the editor's/publisher's favor bank this time around. Just my personal take on the matter, of course -- who knows, maybe my standards are a little higher than theirs."
3,Sloppy editing clearly a distraction,"If you want to follow a horse and its connections through the Triple Crown, there must be better books because the errors in this one are certainly a distraction. For example, the author has two different jockeys riding one horse in a race. It is as if no one bothered to proofread the material. Otherwise, an interesting book."
4,Real Page turner,"I really liked this because it didn't sugarcoat the horse racing world that is reality. It's a good story about how the lives, the triumps and tradgedies are tied into a horse and it's rise and fall. Better than most I've read in recent years."
2,A struggle...,"to get through. I kept praying for this to finally wrap up. It was somewhat informative and had its interesting moments-hard not to when such fascinating characters are involved. But, put it this way, I felt like the writing detracted from the story rather than added to it. The author took a piece of horseracing history that should quicken the heart and instead made it drag on and on. It's as if she couldn't distinguish between the totally uninteresting details and those that should have been in the spotlight. The result was finding boredom while looking for and expecting entertainment. Totally anticlimactic. I'd recommend passing on this. If you want a magnificent story that's eloquently rendered, check out Ruffian: Burning from the Start by Jane Schwartz."
4,A horse lover looks at Three Strides Before the Wire,"Using horseracing as the foundation, Elizabeth Mitchell has written a compelling story about chance, love, and fate. She does, as some old racing hands suggested, go with the love stories: hers and the horses'. What could have been cloying and sappy is instead interesting and inspiring. I found myself wanting to know what happened--and why-- to all of the people and the horses profiled in the book, including Mitchell's boyfriend. Mitchell writes clear prose that is only occasionally too wordy; she documents well (an important attribute given the recent scandals of plagiarism by some of our most well known authors) giving her story credibility. The story of the evolution of horses and the history of gambling, racing, and horse breeding provide a solid base for the interweaving of tales of incalculable loss at the track and of the heart.An easy and interesting read. Highly recommended."
2,could have been great...,"...if she didn't keep talking about herself and her love buddy, chuck. look lady, people want to read a racing book only about the horses, jockeys, and trainers (and we definitely couldn't care any less about your life). this book is o.k. if you totally skip any sections where she mentions herself (easy to do, and they contain absolutely nothing of value or relatedness to the grander story of charismatic's attempted run for the triple crown), and if you can overlook her sappy prose (which tries to imitate the painfully overly-florid writing of the seabiscuit author, both who were evidently gunning hard for the old lady book club dollar)."
2,Not very good!,"This book is a disappointment to say the least. The author's account of Chris Antley and the 1999 Triple Crown lacks focus and is poorly researched. This book has many factual mistakes that even the most causal horse racing fan will catch. This book does not even come close to Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit. The author's own story of a dying boyfriend is not as effective as it should be. There are several horse racing books out right now that are much better: Jockey Gary Stevens manages to give readers a more compelling and touching portrait of Chris Antley in just one chapter of hisautobiography The Perfect Ride, then Mitchell does in her whole book!"
2,Disappointing,"If you're looking for the next Seabiscuit, look elsewhere. This book isn't even remotely in the same league. As a horse racing, history, and literature buff, I was hoping this would be an informative and entertaining read. Instead I trudged through a schmaltzy, unremarkable memoir/biography. Most of the book is obvious and boring. There are redeeming parts, but I'd really only recommend it to die-hard Charismatic fans. There are much better tales out there for those looking for a good slice of horse history, some humor, and beautiful language (e.g. Seabiscuit, Stud, Horse of a Different Color).The title is also inappropriate. The book should have simply been called ""Charismatic."""
1,soap opera meets inaccurate historical ramble,"This book is poorly written, disjointed and a deliberate tear-jerker that only soap opera fans might appreciate. It's clearly trying to appeal to the masses in the way Seabiscuit did-it pretty much copies Seabiscuit's structure-but the storytelling talent just isn't there. The book also has an incredible number of inaccuracies in the middle of historical tirades that do anything but make the past come alive. I'm seriously considering writing the publisher about this book. Chris Antley doesn't deserve the shoddy and self-servicing biography Mitchell's given him. A real shame of a book. Not worth the paper it's printed on."
2,A Disappointing Horse Tale,"This just doesn't have the spark that good books do. For starters, it's way over-researched. What's more, it isn't particularly well written. The words are all function, and the sentences, paragraphs and chapters are unfocused and poorly organized. Mitchell tends to alternately dart around aimlessly from topic to topic, and then get encumbered by extended and uninteresting digressions that are difficult to get through. I'm someone who appreciates skillful use of language, even in sports books, and unfortunately Mitchell's writing is sterile; perfect for reference books, perhaps, and possibly even some political writing (which she seems to specialize in based on her bio), but incapable of doing justice to the dramatic story of Chris Antley and Charismatic. Mitchell includes her own personal story as well in this book in a way that, in my personal opinion, seems gratuitous. I found Three Strides Before the Wire to be a major disappointment."
3,They're actually RAMPAGE by audiovox. Their CHEAP line up.,"I bought these thinking they were regular Audiovox speakers but come to find out that they are RAMPAGE by Audiovox. Which is fine but I feel like they were hiding what they actually are by the title of them. RAMPAGE is generally what you find in K-marts, Autozones etc. Basically just really cheap speakers meant as replacements.For what I paid they aren't half bad but don't expect anything crazy out of them. They do their intended purpose but I was very unhappy with the title, and was kind of expecting regular Audiovox speakers as opposed to their entry level stuff."
4,Good juicer for small oranges,"It's true that this juicer works best with small oranges, as it won't get all the juice out of the bigger ones, and they might not even fit in the space provided to press them.But with the right size oranges, it works very well, and extract all the juice. I've been using it a lot this winter for fresh orange juice full of vitamins!"
5,No Survivors,"In ""No Survivors"", Sutton introduces the reader to the little studied lives and experiences of the U. S. Combat Advisor of the late '60's & '70's Vietnam. Action packed and thrilling drama may be overused phrases, but be assured, ""No Survivors"" is just that. A carefully woven story about successful and unsuccessful survival in the dangerous and duplicitous world of in-country combat operations. Survival, both physical and emotional hinge on hardened, intelligent experience and team work or pure luck. Both succeed and both fail. Time, help & trust do treat the lingering wounds inflicted in the world from which there are no survivors. Just a wonderful read."
5,A Must Read,No Survivors is a gut-wrenching drama which enfolds the non-military reader into an exceptionally well-written story of horror and heroes.
5,hey fred,"hey fred mulgrew, this isnt a review for neil young, dave isnt a cover artist, and please dont write reviews about dave matthews and suggest to people to buy 'neil young stuff', if anyone has ever listened to dave, this setlist is exactly what they wish for, not 'horrible', so dont waste your time and effort and put in a review about this dvd...go write a review about a neil young cd"
2,not as good as the listener supported,"I LOVE DMB WITH A PASSION BUT THEY JUST DIDNT HAVE IT THAT NIGHT OR MAYBE IT WAS THE PRODUCTION VALUE OF THE EQUIPMENT BUT THE DVD VERSION IS NOT THAT GREAT AND THEY PLAY SOME WEIRD SONGS ON THIS DVD WHICH IS USUALLY OK WITH ME BUT THEY LEFT OFF THINGS LIKE CRASH ,41, BUT THEY DO HAVE SONGS LIKE GRANNY , THE KILLER CORTEZ, DANCING NANCIES,WAREHOUSE,WHEN THE WORLD ENDS . SO UNLESS YOURE A BIG FAN OF THE ODDBALL SONGS DONT BUY THIS YOULL BE MUCH HAPPIER WITH THE LISTENER SUPPORTED DVD FROM A NEW JERSEY SHOW . HAVE FUN GO DAVE"
4,Really good tunes...video is a bit amateurish.,"Dave Matthews always sounds incredible in a concert setting and this DVD is no exception. The video format looks pretty amateurish to me, though...almost like it was filmed using consumer-level digital video cameras and simply spliced together."
5,that's no doubt about DMB,"i mean, personally i'm a fan of DMB, and I own all of their their live DVD, and i have to say that THIS ONE, is the BEST amount all the best, if you only have ONE chance to buy ONE live concert DVD this time, try this, you won't be disappointed......"
3,Excellent show,"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a real big Dave Matthews fan. I'd heard some of the bands stuff and I'd seen them once from about a mile away at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Fest but I'd never gone out of my way to get more information.On the advise of a friend I picked up this DVD and was impressed. The band rocked for the better part of three hours and while I was not real familiar with the set list looking at the copyright dates I presume I got music from throughout the career.The highlights included a version of ""Two Step"" to end the first disc and and incredible ""Cortez the Killer"" and ""Jimi Thing"" that Warren Haynes sat in on.All in all a great performance that made me want to go out and buy some of the other cd's."
5,The Best of What's Around,"I have to say that I am a HUGE Dave Matthews Fan! I LOVE him, the band, the music and the concerts sound as good in person as they do on disc.This is one of my very favorite concert videos of his. If you only want to buy one, this would be it. If you can buy more, well then, I have a huge list for you! : )Dave is a feel good musician with so much talent. He has a giving spirit and it shows in the music he brings."
5,Dave Matthews Live at Central Park,"This dvd is awesome. I have had to buy this dvd 4 times because every time I turn someone on to it they love it so much I give it to them so they can enjoy it. Dave and his band know how to entertain. It is all music,no interviews or interuptions just solid music."
5,"This video changed my life, and my diapers","This is an awesome amazing concert video. The band is tight, the sound is superb, the video footage is masterful. I felt like I was there in Central Park, smiling from ear to ear. When guitarist Warren Hayes joins for ""Cortez The Killer"" and ""Jimi Thang"" the show goes to a whole other level, I get chills listening to his solos.Among the concert videos I have seen, this one ranks at the top in a dead heat with Peter Gabriel's Secret World. Huge. Transformational and Trans-Dimensional.Git IT!"
5,a must read,"an excellent, thoroughly researched book on the media and it's lack of involvement with ufo reporting. mr. hansen painstakingly goes through the politics of media manipulation from censorship, deception, distortion and news reporting as media entertainment. this book is an excellent companion to ben bagdikian's books on media monopoly. even if ufo's aren't your forte, missing times provides an insightful look into the lack of thorough journalism research and how journalists take information on face value only. especially if it provided by the government. this book is an enjoyable and great read."
5,Excellent book supported by many examples,"After reading this outstanding book, I pulled out my video library and was able to see exactly how NOVA and other media outlets manipulate the viewer. I have always been aware of this, but this book really underscores this phenomena.It was also fascinating to learn that a Mr. Gene Pope who ""started"" the National Enquirer on its present path was an MIT grad who had worked for the CIA. This book does belong in every UFO library."
4,Average remix single offerring from FLA,"This would be a great remix single if offered by another band but compared to the high standards of previous FLA remix singles this is average. But who are we kidding, if you're an FLA fan like myself you have have them all anyway, so recommended for FLA fans but not anybody else."
3,The album version is better.,"If you've listened to ""The Blade"" on Tactical Neural Implant, you don't need this single. Two remixes of an excellent track, sped up to about 120 bpm unnecessarily. I've heard it played in clubs in '94...more appropriate for that scene than for your stereo."
3,INDUSTRIAL BAND,"An OK single, but the equivalent of generic industrial. These guys really like Front 242."
5,MUST READ!,"If only we all could have La-Verna by our sides to guide and inspire us. But this book is second best. Its motivating and through the activities gets you to take action and move down the path towards achieving your own hopes and dreams. Run, don't walk and buy copies for your friends."
4,One of a kind,Old Norton Buffalo could really sing and play the harp he had a sound all of his own that no one could duplicate.
4,Unique item.,I was glad that I stumbled onto this item. It provides an external connection for a SATA drive.It even provides a SATA power connection.
3,"Good performing, affordable blade, but the plastic anchor swivel breaks easy.","I don't like the plastic swivel anchors they use in wiper blades nowadays. If you bump them with an ice-scraper, or let the wiper snap back onto the windshield too hard, it breaks the reatiner clip. Then, when you really need your wipers the most, it comes loose from the wiper arm. In my case, the metal wiper arm ran a big scratch across my windshield. Now, I look for all-metal blade bodies."
1,Great in the summer!!,"Purchased these from amazon on 11/30/12. Today, 12/28, I drove to work when it was 18 degrees. I had to turn on the windshield washer to remove salt and low and behold my ""winter wipers"" were froze and I was left with solid windshield washer on my windshield. My wipers were froze after being in the garage all nite. Beware, these are only good in the summer and freeze-up in lower temperatures."
1,Pretty terrible wipers,These wipers leave messy streaks when they're on instead of a satisfying squeegeeing of all the water. Very disappointing. I also don't think the winter covering is necessary unless you have a hard time shaking off your wipers when it snows (you're already probably going to be scraping your window anyway).
1,Consider Michelin blades first!,"We purchased our ANCO blades as our originals finally gave up on the first week of December 2012.You know the streaking, snow not moving, leaving the obstructed view and frustration. 2 days later and $30 lighter the blades started exhibiting the same issues. WE had to use our ice scraper on a warm vehicle to keep our windshield clean. We had bought 2 sets 1 for our son's truck and the other for ours. We returned the un opened ones and bought 2 sets of Michelin Winter blades. Immediantly we seen the difference and after 2 weeks everything is still good.We have heard of similar issues from other drivers. We live in Saskatchewan and our winter can be tough on equipment. This is just a heads up."
5,Ali's Famous Punch,One of the most classic pictures in boxing/sports history. Ali vs Liston 1st round knockout. Definitely need to own for any boxing fan.
1,Oh hey wait it's Ali and who?,You see Ali... You see Sonny.. the rest of the picture is blur. Ali is sort of blurred too. Not worth the money to have such bad resoultion.
3,First book Effort,"You can see Tim Mackintosh-Smith's style emerging, but not the equal of his Ibn Battuta trilogy, which I loved and am even re-reading in parts."
4,A deceptively good listen,"In a musical landscape that has been flooded with recycled hip hop, cookie-cutter American Idol pop, and wanna-be pop-punk, it is refreshing to hear a band that seems to model themselves to some degree after bands like The Kinks and Enuff Z'Nuff. This debut album is hardly the most aggressive collection of songs put forth for public consumption, but their modest sound leads to extremely catchy selections such as ""Meat Market"" and ""Makeup,"" with even the sappy ""Longest Hour of My Life"" having some appeal. A very unexpected surprise."
3,It's Just OK...,"I bought this based on reviews I read here, and it is good, but not worthy of 5 stars. All the songs sound the same after awhile and I got bored with it quickly.Maybe after time it will grow on me, but for now I give it 3 stars."
4,Great pop album!,"This album was introduced to me through a few friends on a tour bus and since then I've probably listened to this album over 100 times. I'm looking forward to 100 more! It's a great album from start to finish. It's fun. It's pop. What more could you ask for? Notable tracks to check out would be ""Born to Do"",""Rich Girls, Poor Girls"",""Makeup"" and ""Meat Market"". If you're having a party throw this on the stereo and people are sure to have a great time!"
2,Documentary,"Watch out ! This is just a documentary, there are no clips on this wonderful album by the Wonder man."
3,"Good background, but where are the songs?","I hoped this video would have both the documentary and the songs to the album, but I was mistaken. The documentary is annoying because it gives you a sniff of some songs but leaves you wanting more. If you buy the DVD you'll want to buy the album too, but I wanted both on one disc."
3,DVD has the potential but lacks content,I agree with another reviewer...this DVD should include the entire album on it...the documentary is only about 70 minutes and I would like to see some old concert footage as a bonus to buy the DVD...every month we see the lamest movies of the year released on DVD with maybe 2 or 3 good ones out of 100....you can't go wrong with Stevie but the VHS video offers the same for less ($13.99)
3,could of included more music from stevie!,shame about this dvd...NOT GOOD SELLING DISCS...shame its content has more talking... than music... but the two songs on the disc are gems...!!
3,too primitve.,I bought this for my mother and she really tried to use it. No temp control for the oven made it impossible to use as an oven.We finally gave up on it and I got her another toaster oven and got out her old coffee maker.
3,Good overall guide,"I bought this guide along with two others and this was a nice, complete guide covering all the islands. I used it in conjunction with the other guides, which targeted the specific islands I was visiting, for a big picture overview of Hawaii. Fodor's helped me decide which islands to visit (Maui and Kauai) with color photography and descriptions. I also enjoyed reading about the history of the islands. The list of website links in the back of the book were also very helpful. I don't think this one book is enough, overall, to pinpoint where to go once you're on the islands. I didn't like that it didn't give me complete descriptions of the beaches. Turns out my hotel was on a beach that wasn't suitable for swimming. But the book didn't tell me that. You'll definitely need this book plus another, it's not enough on its own."
3,surprisingly heavy and thick,"this is my 3rd Expedition, with 2 previous models i was very happy and they served me well 8-10years. When i received this model i was slightly disappointed by the following facts1) the watch is quite heavy2) its thick!3) the band material is in fact not a pure leather but the mix of leather(upper side) and the rubber(inner side)4) the bezel is covered by kind of the shiny lacquer. I wonder how long that shiny look will last?What i liked:1) the stylish look2) the battery life is 7(!) yearsAt the end, 50 euros is a very good price for this watch, but counting drawbacks that i mentioned i can give only 3 points of 5 for this product."
3,1029,i ordered from the picture blue cheese no blue in what i received very disappointed john w allen
4,"Amazing Sound Quality, But a tad inconvenient","The Denon AHD2000s are a solid pair of headphones that have outstanding solid quality for the price. With these headphones i heard tiny details i've never heard before in a song i've listened to many times before with normal headphones. The bass is solid on these headphone as well, and delivers a nice solid, deep tone. As for the design and convenience, these headphones could be better. they are way too big large and a very awkward on your head. they also have a huge cable thats not detachable, leading to a lack of portability. Otherwise there nice."
4,Awesome sound quality - terrible wire,"I love the sound on this one, but I find the thick cable extremely annoying. It's hard to manage, unnecessarily long, too thick, and is forked to connect to both ears separately (unlike most other headphones that have a single cable attached to the left ear piece). The wire, being so thick, is not flexible & has caused the soldering at the 3.5mm jack to come loose twice (I soldered it back on both times, of course, but I'd rather not have to repair it every 2 months).The wire is the only thing I'd change in this product - otherwise perfect."
2,No good for the long haul,"The high quality sound of these phones has been well attested to and I have no disputes there. However after having owned the Denon's for 2 years I can say that the build quality is unacceptably awful. In the last six months both the right and left cups have literally fallen off the headband, (due to very inadequate screws) and the left pad has detached from it's cup. If you buy this product I would recommend industrial grade super glue as well, if not I urge you to look elswhere for a quality pair of headphones."
1,Made in China!,"I don't know what's wrong with all of you people. The sound from these is very blah and boomy. Yes, even when amped. Plus they're made in China and there's no serial number! Do yourself a favor and get some HD600's. Way better all around sound and you can get them at a killer price right now. One more thing, if you're looking at these for recording, get you a pair of senn's 280's! Built like a tank and $cheap!"
5,Professional Sound Quality,"As an example of having true sound, for anyone who is familiar with the rock group: The Who I will take the song from them entitled The Real Me. There is a bass solo from bassist John Entwhistle which is quite a fabulous solo in my opinion. Compare this example on these headphones versus a pair for $50 you will see the difference in the sound quality and it is not just for the price difference. Your ears will pick up the difference almost immediately. The sound is so extremely clear. Staying with The Who, for anyone whom has heard Won't Get Fooled Again there is a keyboard solo that is also quite remarkable. The treble sound you hear almost makes it like you are there in concert listening to it live.In summary for anyone looking for quality I would rank Denon above Sennheiser. I have had the latter before and in my opinion the Denon is the better of the two."
5,Excellent!,"I have heard several headphones in the $200 range and these are undoubtedly my favorite cans. They sound fantastic straight out of ipod/zune but benefit extremely from a dedicated DAC/Amplifier (that bring the mids slightly forward and tighten up the bass). If you are planning to get these, don't hesitate for a moment. You simply cannot go wrong."
2,"Sound Great, Durability Poor","These headphones sound amazing...I mean, really good. But just beware they need to be treated with care. After a year, the pin that connected the left headphone has broken, and so now the headphones are completely unwearable. And of course this happens after the warranty expires. I expected a bit more from a high-end manufacturer like Denon. I doubt I'll be buying Denon again."
5,Balanced and Versatile,"The D2000 are great headphones for just about any musical genre. Frequency response is well balanced with plowing, authoritative bass, clean, smooth midrange (I cannot understand comments to the effect that the D2000 have ""no mids""!) and detailed, extended highs. The D2000 have both an adroit quickness and a liquid smoothness, making them quite special to listen to.While they do benefit extremely well from a good, dedicated headphone amplifier (I'm currently using the Bada PH-12 and Darkvoice 337 to excellent effect), the Denon can sound ridiculously satisfying straight from a Walkman, the 1/8"" jack from a mini-component system (JVC C-220C) or A/V receiver (Denon AVR-1905).The best, most versatile closed headphones I've ever tried, and one of the best headphones, period, that I've ever heard."
2,Great sound but they don't even last a year,"The sound is all you could want but these literally fell apart in nine months. They are only connected by a flimsy nut and bolt into plastic that holds the full weight of very heavy phones. That bolt comes loose, off comes the headphone. Repair the left side for $100 in two weeks and then the right side falls off because the phones need to both be bolted down tight to hold together. After I spent $225 fixing them they just fell apart yet again a week later. Folks saying these are well built are either lying through their teeth or haven't had them long enough. Do not waste your money. Four star sound, no star construction. Ripoff."
2,Don't buy!,These cans sound great but I wish I had done more research to discover their major design flaw.The cups are held on with really cheap plastic screws. I think I used them maybe 5 times before they fell apart.For this much money you think Denon could spend another 4 cents on a metal screw!Bummer.
5,Great as people suggest.,"Not an headphone ""expert"" but have had a pair of good Senns, Grados, JVCs, these are the better balanced of the bunch. These do definitely need a little amping to bring out their sound or it will sound under powered, lacking bass punch, and mostly flat. I use an ASUS Essence ST sound card that has a built-in headphone amp. On the Normal gain setting, you get what I just described. Stop playback, turn the volume down to about 30 and switch the gain in the Xonar Audio Center (it's a hammer icon next to analog out, when headphone is selected) to High Gain. Adjust volume to your liking, and they will come alive with the missing bass punch and greater clarity.So, don't give up on these before you have them amped!"
2,not like its daddy,"I rated them a 2 but they are not really that bad - I just wanted to indicate that my expectations were higher and give people a head's up.I bought these as a budget alternative to the 7000s, which totally blew me away. ON the 2000s the bass is phenomenal, but there is a big dip in the midrange between 1 - 4 khz. Then there is a big rise up to 10 khz (which seems to be standard for modern designs trying project a soundstage). But the overall effect is unnatural and edgey, even after burning in for over 50 hours.So they went back and I got some beyer 990's instead (good bass , less edgey).I am also considering AKG 701 / 702 for my recording studio (they may not have as strong bass, but otherwise they are as neutral as what's out there)."
3,Nice Headphones But...,"I liked these headphones at first, but after using them for several hours and several days I decided to return them. Here is why...-I didn't think they sounded that much better than quite a bit cheaper, run of the mill sony earbuds.-They started to get a bit undercomfortable on my head after a few hours of wearing them because of a bit too much pressure on the sides of my head...would have liked to be able to bend them out a bit to lighten the pressure, but not possible.-Not enough bass for me...but to be fair I discovered that I like to ""feel"" the bass more in my chest, being that I'm use to having a high end external speakers and equipment with big subwoofers and probably no headphones will give me what I'm looking for......So I'm just going to stick with much cheaper headphones and invest my extra money into external speakers and equipment for my home theater.Just my opinion :)"
2,Needs to read Bill Dunham,"This had such promise...but never materialized. Havil is obviously enchanted with Euler--who wouldn't be?--but he fails to explain the material, and seems to have failed to proofread his book.In Dunham's Journey Through Genius, the explanations are clear and step-wise. I read it with a thick pad of paper and a pen--I don't really trust anyone--but it was all workable. Havil states things unclearly, so it's far from obvious just what he's trying to show. The discussions are unfollowable, at least to me.Reading as much of this as I was able to stand is a lot like finding out that there's no Santa Claus."
2,Unfriendly,"There is no shortage of good material in this book. The problem is Havil's writing style is very unfriendly it's as if he thinks you already know the material. There are many section that are written badly and are after re-reading several times I still don't understand them. Also this is written for folks who know math very well and I'm one of those folks, yet I find many sections hard to understand. Genius is in taking something complicated and breaking it down and making it simple, which Havil doesn't do. He's no William Dunning."
2,Over intellectualized something trivial,"Summation of series is statistical and entropical in nature. In fact summtion is rather superposition. When f(x) = 1/x, integral do not exist but only summation. Are there a profound relations between the constants pi, i, e , and gamma? This book had not answer that for me."
3,3rd grader,I love your book your other books to i wish i could write like you its AMAZING! how you write. I love reading your books.fromBlake Rinckey
4,RFID (RF Coupling in the Near field),"RFID is a well written book. It covers hardware, regulations,and RFID applications.What I like about RFID is that it explains rF devicesin the near -field. Almost every other book I have read is about RF far-field.The knowledge is useful in understanding the sources of noise in lab equipment caused by high frequency induction fields.(These signals go right through the usual metal enclosures.)Its useful."
2,Total gym 6-8 minute workout,"I purchased the John Carleo 6-8 minute workout and have used it for 4 weeks now. I am a former bodybuilder and doctor as well. And have been in the health arena for nearly 35 years. I am 50 years young to give you some background on me. My opinion of this dvd is that I am somewhat disappointed. Although it is a 6-8 minute workout, it really is for those who are either very out of shape, or much older then I am. If the reader is looking for a light workout, and time is a challenge, this is a good dvd. If, however, you are looking for something more challenging, I would not recommend this workout. If I were to grade it 1-5 where 5 is the best, I would grade it a 2. If the manufacturer would put a grade on this (beginner, intermediate, advanced) that would have been more helpful and honest. I put a 2 on it more because I felt somewhat deceived by the promotion of it, but felt I really wanted to give it a try."
2,Beginners only,"I am not in the greatest shape of my life, but this dvd does nothing for me. I've only had the Total Gym for a couple of weeks. I was going to use this workout to supplement when I don't have a lot of time or energy. It is way too easy for me. Unless you haven't worked out in years, have a lot of weight to lose, etc., this won't be enough. I end up just adding my own things as I don't feel like I worked out at all with the dvd alone."
3,NOT for experienced folks,"Okay...so after reading the reviews, I still took the chance hoping to learn a few things I could do on the total gym and hoping it would help me get back in shape. It did show me a few exercises, but it's not that helpful for those of us who have ever visited a gym for any length of time or have started getting back to a strength training routine . The exercises don't provide enough resistance, even on the highest incline. I would recommend it if you are using it as a rehab DVD."
5,Great Movie,This is my favorite Disney movie it isn't very well known but it's very good. This has a lot of elements to it and is a bit darker than most Disney movies but its great. I recommend this movie for fans of quest to Camelot and the last unicorn
1,BORing,"Luckily, I did not buy this book; I read it while enjoying coffee and cheesecake in a Barnes and Noble (sorry Amazon!). It states the obvious obviously. You'd be better off writing your script and asking your friends for their opinion.To illustrate - do you know the definition for protagonist, antagonist, conflict, drama? I certainly hope so! And do you really need 100 pages to define these terms for you? I certainly hope not!My advice for screenwriters who truly want to understand story is to read ""The hero's journey, the mythological structure of storytelling"" and Robert McKee's ""story."" Go to McKee's seminar. Buy some scripts. Download scripts off the Internet. Then buy the software - Final Draft is my personal favorite - and start writing. Let the software worry about how to format - it's all automatic."
2,Not my idea of good movies,"The book itself has a booring look. The letters are small, no pictures and so on. It could have something of interest though. I did not think so. I obviosly do not like the same kind of movies as the author. I like Terminator, Alien and Indiana Jones. Of the list of good movies listed by the author was only Thelma and Louise one of my liking and three I count as boring. If you like the very dramatic kind of movies you will like this book. If you are more for the action-type of movies, do not buy this one."
1,The Worst!,"This is, by far, the worst screenwriting book I've ever read, almost as bad as Lew Hunter's piece of drivel. If you read this book and follow its instructions, I'll bet you won't be able to write a screenplay at all. Buy ""Story"" instead."
1,Very poor shape for a used book,I was very disappointed with the used book I received. I always order used books but this one was ridiculous. The cover was mostly torn and it looked horrible.
2,Not interesting,It had NO POINT! What was with the end and why did they even need to have the whole Titanic thing in it? I have read MUCH better! I recomend SOS Titanic instead.
2,boring.....,"this book was not as good as it could have been.it was entertaining but not something i would read again.She described the sinking in one chapter! First Albert is on the ship, then suddonly its a day later and Albert is on the carpathia! What happened to the stuff in between?The writter did not portray the sinking for what it really was -a tragity. there was more to the sinking then that.the movie is soooo much better. if you have not read this book,then don't bother, its not worth it.signed, Madalyn Reed"
3,Not enough sinking!!!!!!!!,I thought the story was okay but it was called Titanic Crossing and it didn't have enough talk on it the Titanic sinking. That is probably the only reason the Titanic is famous! In my opinion the Titanic sinking didn't even affect the remainder of the story much. It could of easily been a good book without the Titanic involved. I have read MUCH better than this!
3,Could she make the ship sink any faster?!?!,"It was a good book I admit, but she made the ship sink slower. She didn't really tell that much detail. If your in a bind read this, if you have time to find another book do it!"
1,Titanic Crossing,"VERY BORING!!!!I advise you NOT to buy this book if you haven't read it yet.The plot is boring , and it has nothing about the sinking(maybe just about 1 paragraph)which is the whole point!!Who cares about Alberts stupid family life?The book is supposed to be about the TITANIC.I think that I wasted my money.I request buying a better book, such as ""TITANIC,THE LONG NIGHT"" by Diane Hoh. That was a GOOD book. This book is not worth your money,trust me!!!!!!"
1,Where's the ship??????,"This book Has almost nothing to do with the Titanic!!!!!!All Albert (the main character) is EVER doing is either thinking about his dead dad or, talking with His simple mother, his horribly spoiled and bratty sister, or Alice, a boring caracter from another family. Plus he's in SECOND CLASS!!!!!!!!!!! YAWN!!!!!!Why couldn't he be in a cooler class like first or third? the only almost GOOD part of the story is the sinking, witch is like TWO PARAGRAPHS LONG!!!!!!!!!! This book is REALLY stupid."
4,Titantic Crossing,Titantic Crossing by Barbra Williams was very good book because of the discriptive writting. This book gave the reader an excellent idea of what it would have been like on the Titantic. For example it gave a very clear view of how the people lived on the Titantic. This book really takes the reader to the middle of the Atlantic when she describes the freezing temperature and the ice fields. This book was very good because of the discriptive writing that enhanced the book and it should be on all middle school reading lists.
4,Not as detailed or to do with the Titanic as I'd hoped!,An excellent book symphozizing the tragedy of the Titanic disaster but not as much detail regarding the ship! The plot is very weak and the sinking does not describe enough to make me feel like I am on the ship witnissing this . If you are a Titanic buff like me then go for it !
5,a wonderful story that is not a fake,I loved this story how it went through day to day life on the Titanic with a boy named Albert and his family. The story inspirational and scary at times is one of the best I have read in a while.
2,Steps to Christ,Misophonia sufferers will not be able to tolerate this narrator. Wish I had sampled first. :-(Needs younger narrator without alot of dental work.
4,Nice looking & sharp,This set matches very nicely with the rest of my kitchen-wares. It is very functional and sharp. It is an excellent buy.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CABLE,"You will be extremely dis-satisfied with this product, it is complete and utter garbage. The only way to use this cable is at 640x480 or you will see interference that is tragically bad, and ruins your gaming/mce experience.Order the OEM Microsoft Product or you will be sorry."
2,Might return it.,"The VGA worked flawlessly, but the audio connectors do not fit my LCD's audio inputs. I am using a Scepter 22"". I should have read the forums that it requires a RCA jack. Maybe I will get some kind of adapters. But, it's likely that I might end up returning this."
5,Good product,This is a good cable for the price and it works well with Xbox 360.Now my son can leave me alone.
1,Simply terrible,"If you have some sort of vendetta against your eyes and a complete lack of appreciation even the lowest bar for image quality, you have located the perfect product. If you actually intend to use your Xbox360 for anything other than excruciating self-torture stay away! The image produced by this cable is blurry, full of ghosting and washed out."
1,Terrible Cable - Get the Real Deal Instead,"Like others have said, this cable is awful. There is MAJOR ghosting and poor picture quality. Yeah, the ""official"" cable is twice as much, but why bother at all if you're not going to try to get a descent picture? The real cable works."
3,xbox computer monitor cable,"the product is not actually the one in the picture, it is green and white and is actually an off brand... i was slightly dissapointed, but it works fine so i am satisfied."
3,Cheap solution,"Only buy this product if you are trying to save some money, as it is not the greatest quality cable. However, it does work fine when there are darker colors being shown on your monitor, only when there are lighter colors do you see some picture degradation."
1,TERRIBLE CHEAP CABLES DO NOT BUY,"This cable is terrible. I kept on getting 2 refresh rate lines, coming down my screen, I tried a high end LCD and a CRT monitor and both had the same refresh rate lines coming down, the image quality was terrible (grainy). The price was appealing, but they are terrible cables.I ended up going to the local store and buying the Microsoft VGA HD cables and have never been happier.Intec is not responding to e-mails (apparently these cables have a lifetime warranty..HA!!)I would sugged buying the Microsoft VGA cables instead and don't waste your time (as others have suggested)"
1,unexceptional performance...,Do not buy this product. Simple as that. I used three different monitors and the quality of the picture was terrible. The colors were muted no matter what the monitor settings were and the video contained duplicated ghost images no matter what was on display.
1,horrible experience,"waited forever to have the item shipped, it never managed to get to my mailbox, horrible experience But im not going to bother with a customer service complaint to fight over a 15 dollar item. ill get it from somewhere else from someone whom will make sure it gets to me. thanks for taking my money and not delivering."
1,Help! I need to wash this noise right out of my ears: Reba murders Nellie!,"Sorry, Reba, but Nellie Forbush is a young, educated nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, with a pleasant, southern accent...and far from the ignorant, annoying, vulgar sounding, grunting backwoods hick with a hillbilly accent that you portray on this recording! Reba KILLS this entire concert, and, besides the outlandish, out-of-character and out-of-place accent...just doesn't have the singing and acting capabilities to do justice to this role! Both McEntire and the director of this concert need to be arrested for the murder of Nellie Forbush, American Nurse! Perhaps, MS McEntire is simply playing herself, instead of attempting to become the character of Nellie!"
5,South Pacific Concert Version 2005 Reba McIntire Brian Stokes Mitchell,"Excellent - What a great idea to have Reba McIntire play Ensign Nellie Forbush. Nellie in the musical is from Little Rock, Arkansas. Reba is a great actress and it is nice to have Nellie's songs sung in the country style instead of legit style. I like the legit style in most broadway shows. Brian Stokes Mitchell is also great as Emille DeBecque and the audience gives him a standing ovation for a long time after he sings This Nearly Was Mine. Even though it is 'just' a concert version rather than fully staged, I was thoroughly into the story and I shed lots of tears. Conrad John Schuck as Captain Brackett is great, too."
5,Better than I could have imagined,"To compare this recording with the original cast recordings of the 1950's is like comparing a jr. high science experiment with a space shuttle launch. Reba McIntyre is wonderful, giving a slight country twang just where and when it was needed (wasn't Nellie from Arkansas, after all?) And what can one say about Mr. Mitchell? That booming baritone filled every nook and cranny of Carnagie Hall, and his clever, halted, French-accented dialogue made his character interpretation enjoyable and realistic. Danieley and White were probably who Rogers and Hammerstein had in mind when they wrote this musical. I loved every song and every word of dialogue."
2,Martin and Pinza still have it all.,"As far as this recording goes, it seems the performers are more concerned with how ""South Pacific"" is going to serve them rather than how best they can serve the material. Reba is delightful, sweet, etc., but she is far too country and takes ""hick"" far too seriously vocally. Brian Stokes Mitchell does not have enough lyrical, resonant quality showing in the voice -- it all seems pushed as a means of showing the ""dramatic."" The masses will buy it, but not me. I am giving the CD away. I am quite content with the Original cast, even though the sound quality is, regrettably, inferior. It all seems to be intended for ""crowd-pleasing"" and not done out of respect for one of the Musical Theatre's greatest treasures."
1,A Cornballed & Hokey Trivilialization of South Pacific,"Maybe I am too old (56) and have too fond memories of the earlier, classic recordings of this wonderful musical (the 1949 Enzio Pinza/Mary Martin recording or 1958 Rossano Brazzi/Mitzi Gaynor recording), but I found that its recent Carnegie Hall rendition with Reba McEntire awful. McEntire has a wonderful voice but she sure corn-balled up the Nellie Forbush role beyond belief -- both vocally and visually (crossing her eyes to look the country bumpkin) -- to the point where I found that it was almost unwatchable. Listening to the CD wasn't much better. I know that I'm in the minority, but I'm afraid that the point of this 2006 South Pacific was to attract new listeners to South Pacific through the popularity of McEntire, instead of by assemling a cast that was up to one of Richard Rodgers' best musicals."
1,BOO on inappropriate casting!,"I understand opportunities in musical theater are limited for black/African-American actors, but they are as limited, if not more, for Asian actors as well.Though her talent is great, to cast Lilias White as Bloody Mary and THEN another black actress as the mute daughter, is such a nasty slap in the face for Asian actresses who could have easily filled those spots!With all the talent from Miss Saigon, King and I, Avenue Q, Pacific Overtures, THERE ARE ASIAN ACTORS OUT THERE!!!!BOO on the casting for this concert!Not only did it miss by a long shot, it has gone and offended a distinct culture and its people!"
5,A wonderful blend of voices,"I have been a Reba McEntire fan for many years. I had the good fortune to see her on Broadway in ""Annie Get Your Gun"". Her performance was amazing, and it was hard to believe that she was not trained in the musical theater, she held the audience in the palm of her hand.The selection of Reba and Brian Stokes Mitchell for this performance was genius. The entire cast creates what Rogers and Hammerstein must have had in mind when they wrote this wonderful score."
2,Washingto D.C. done over,"Michael Hanson is a political bagman for the Democratic partyin the 2000 election. He has been in Washington since he was a young man anddeveloped both friends and enemies. He is being, yet again, called to a Congressional hearing.The result is that he meets Oliver Devon and his ex-wife Daniellewho is a lawyer for the Republican chairman of the committee.The infighting here is dirty and the dead bodies pile up:one of them is Hanson's daughter Ariel who he never really knew was his daughter until she diedand left a note that he was her next of kin.A lot of the connections that build up in the back roomcigar smoker of a novel are pretty fantastic like theRussian suitcase bomb connections?They throw around millions of dollars from off shore accountslike it was water here.Washington is set as an influence town wheremoney speaks loudest when liberally applied.Mostly I just disliked the attitudes of both the heroand the villains in this noveland the Epilogue."
4,Great novel...,"This book would work great as a movie. I love the politics. Wow! I hope them types of things really don't go on in D.C.. The ending caught me off guard, and I usually figure these novels out early on."
5,Excellent Read- A Real Washington Insider!,Blood is an obvious insider on the Washington circuit. This is an explosive read from start to finish.
1,South Park by Prima Publishing,my item was not shipped in over a week and I got no letter saying why or when it would be shipped. I cancelled my order with them.
4,They are wonderful,"If you want to laugh with 4 very diferent children, this book will help you a lot. With a very good sense of humor, they carry you to a completely crazy world, where when can look with good eyes for all the problems that we have in our normal life. Read the book, watch the movies and don't worry about Kenny....he will be al right."
5,Great winter blades,"For 25 years I have used these blades on both my cars and trucks in New England's harsh winters and they have been great. There is an reviewer on this page that didn't like the blade, first I would ask why someone who lives in Florida would be using a winter blade????? For me they are perfect and I'm on this site looking for 2 more sets."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Horrible and useless product which had to be thrown away so I could go buy one from the local auto parts store. The one from the parts store worked like a charm. Why? So many reasons and it's not worth the time to detail them all so please do yourself a favor and take my word!
5,Head bobbing Beats...,"Just like the first Headz comp this one is essential. Jazz? Hip hop? Trip hop? Soul? Rap? Turntablism? It's a bit of all of it and then some. Mutt music that sounds great, especially on a system with some bass. This one has a bit more ambience in places along with the trippy, jazzy beat thing. If your head isn't bobbing throughout this comp something is wrong.It's got Beat, Beat, Beat.""Do you understand the cultureDo you understand the time.Do you understand the rhythm.Do you understand the rhyme?""Even though this is ten years old, it still sounds remarkably fresh, especially in light of the derivative drivel that passes for various genres today.I could listen to this all day and in fact put these comps on when nothing else sounds good. It always hits the spot.Hunt down a copy. You won't regret it."
1,too small,when stated the music sheet is miniature they weren't kidding. i was expecting 8 1/2 x 11 but the booklet was quite small and useless to me because of the size. i can't recommend it to others.
4,Good Gift,Got this as a gift for me mum and she loved it. There was one tea she did not care for but the rest she liked. She loved the tins and used them later.
5,Delicious,Arrived just fine. I liked some of the teas better than others but each tin was packed with fresh leaves and quite delicious. I recommend this for anyone who likes green tea and is looking to find new flavors or as a gift for someone who likes green tea or someone looking to get into loose leaf green tea. Highly recommended!
3,Green Teas Sampler,"I thought it was a great idea, but have not used it yet.Any idea where I can get tea bags to put the tea in?"
5,forever in texas,this book was really good. again jodi thomas did it again. she knows how to make you fall in love with her books.
3,Good,"This book was not as good as Stepping Heavenward...a little bit more stereotypical with the characters, but still a good, light read using Biblical principles"
4,4.5 great stuff,"Classic... Hypnotized and Morbid Curiosity crush! Killer cd from the old days of thrash metal. A big improvement over their ""Breaking the Silence"" cd. Must have"
5,One word- WOW!,"Too bad the scale only goes to five stars... Up until a few days ago, I thought that bands like Metallica were as thrashy as they come. Now, since I've listened to these guys, thrash metal has taken on a more refined definition. Heathen combines some downright heavy thrash with Judas Priest's harmonizing guitars, booming drums and a Bruce Dickinson-like vocalist. However, it's not just mindless, blazing guitars, either. The lyrics are powerful and relevant to today's twisted society. ""Hypnotized"" condemns televangelists- ""Fools give money to the church, to earn their place with God..."" and ""Morbid Curiosity"" explores the media's attraction to death and suffering of other people. The songs have a good variation in their sound and the music changes pace constantly. For more intelligent thrash, buy this album. There's no dissapoinment involved, especially if you still think Kirk Hammett can play fast."
5,A severely and criminally overlooked album and band.,"Heathen first caught my ear when this album was released. What I like most about it is the fact that the music was really heavy, almost heavy enough to be death metal but they also had a melodic singer with a good range. In the cookie monster vocal infested slew of metal bands today, I really miss these days, when a vocalist could actually sing. A buddy of mine made me a copy of ""Breaking the Silence"" and I didn't really like it as much. This one, though is definitely a classic.Oh, and one more thing. The reason why the list price is $40 is because this is an import version. When you open Amazon, do a search for Heathen. You'll see another version of this album that only costs $17. Just thought I'd point that out."
3,Heathen,"I agree with other reviewers. Can't say much more than what's already been said, or typed. This, in my opinion is better than Breaking the Silence. Tighter sounding and less raw, more refined. Songs are lengthy. Vocals are mid-high tone, good singer. Talented group."
1,to many stars,i didn't like it and for some reason they won't let me print that i have reviewed this book 10 times and they never print my reviews. maybe this time i'll get lucky.
3,"Great show, convenient way to view, but WHERE is episode three??","I have bought all six seasons of Sex and the City on Amazon Instant Video. I appreciate the ease of purchase and viewing. Every season has been perfect, except season six. For the longest time there was no option to buy the entire series, only episode by episode...which is ridiculous. I waited and finally Amazon responded to the many requests to make the entire series available for purchase (thanks Amazon)! However, I am very disappointed to discover that episode three is missing. I have searched online about this and it seems that many people have discovered this and Amazon has done nothing to rectify the problem. Anyway...great show, but disappointed to have to seek out an additional episode three."
4,Fabulous!,I missed the series when it was shown in the late 90s. It is smart and very funny! The actresses were great - Kim Catrell was exceptional!!!!!!
1,Deceiving...,"I ordered Season 6 of Sex and the City. When the dvd's arrived they would not play in my dvd player. When I contacted the seller he said it clearly states that I ordered ""region 2"" dvd. I have bought many dvd's and have never had to look to see what ""region"" it is coming from. I am in the U.S. and it came from the U.S. so I would assume it is valid in the U.S. I think this seller is being deceiving in assuming a normal American buyer would know that there is a difference. I have asked numerous people and nobody has heard of ever having to ask. And the icing on the cake when I return it, I get to pay for shipping TWICE and I still have no dvd set. Total crock."
2,Poorly executed game,"Mostly just a boring poorly executed game. Graphics nothing to get excited about, and the game play is pretty lame. I think I'll be trying to sell this shortly to whichever game shop will buy it."
3,Nothing Special,"The only reason I picked up this game was because of the $19.99 price tag and the need for some hack 'n slash before God of War 3 (and chains of Olympus) comes out. Beowulf is not a bad game, but it's certainly not a very innovative title. The graphics are on par with a good PS2 game. Some of the controls are a little awkward. Learning the combos is easy (pretty simple button mashing). Beowulf is capable of fighting with ""carnal fury"", which is a state where he becomes very powerful and can inflict intense damage for a period of time. He can also give commands to his Thanes (army of buddies). The games uses contextual button presses during boss battles and certain sequences. That can be a little frustrating at times. If you don't time your button presses just right, you either die or have to start over. It seems to me that Ubisoft tried to rush this game out to coincide with the release of the film, and it shows. It needs more polish, but what do you expect for $19.99?"
5,Great Game,For $20 this game is awesome. The graphics are desent and the story line is more complete then the movie.
2,Beowulf blah,Although the storyline was good and the beginning sequence got me interested in the game I did not like that there were no control instructions and I was unable to progress very far in the game.
1,Knee Jerk reactions needed,"The old game Dungeon Lair with Dirk the Daring is far better than this poor excuse of a PS3 game. Don't waste your money unless you enjoy game play that only prompts you to do the PRESS X NOW kinda thing....note: even when you press the given button per the on screen prompt, there is no garantee that the game will act upon it."
2,a game without the quality of PS3,"This game don't have the quality expected from games of PS3, the graphics looks that were made in only two days, and are not the same that you see on the introduction movie of this game.i think for the PS3 need a better maker of games, the console can do more than that.but i only paid 10 for it."
5,Inspirational,This book is so inspirational it amazes me. It is quote after quote by famous authors on different topics that apply to horror writing. I think this is one of the most inspirational books on horror writing. I love this book!
4,An excellent MD portable,"A great MD portable recorder. Definitely the best portable minidisc recorder available in the USA. Long battery life, small size, what is arguably the best sound quality for any MD portable recorder, superior recording features, and an pretty good remote control set this unit apart from the pack. If you're debating getting into MD (minidisc), there are few better ways to start."
5,It's worth the bucks!,"I have this unit for a month now, all i can say is WOW! The construction is solid with different button lay-outs for every purpose, sounds is excellent with deep bass although you can hear a few squeeks at max, but hey who wants to listen at max w/out damaging your eardrums.Titling can be done at ease, it just takes a few minutes to practice, long battery life you'll have all the fun recording and editing. It has all the necessary accesories for recording with the optical cable you'll have cd quality music, the strap and pouch for travelling, what more can you ask for? But the headphones just missed it. Over all a great buy, definitely you'll be satisfied, it'll blow the competition!"
5,Worth the price!,"Decided to get into Minidiscs and bought this one because honestly, it looked pretty spiffy. Amazon shipped it out and I got it pretty quick and immediately began to play and record with it. Definately easy to use with excellent features that just make this player worth it. The price is resonable for a minidisc player/recorder and this one is definately worth the price."
5,Get one...it is great!,"I purchased a Sony R55 a few months ago and returned it after a couple weeks. This unit blows the Sony away! The R55 had many shortcomings, but its most obvious was its poor battery life which yields around 3.5 hours of playback. The Sharp will give you about 11-12 hours! The other most noticeable thing was the sound quality, another area where the Sony fails in comparison. I find the drums a bit tinny with the Sony unit. I have found that the Sharp's ATRAC captures the sound much closer to the original. The recording features of this unit are also fantastic! If you are interested in MD, this is the way to start!"
1,robert perkins is a misgiuded spoiled rich kid,confused... robert perkins has issues he chooses to play out in print. the only interesting part of the story was his nervous breakdown. he should keep his 'plastic' boat in new england waters (safer that way - for him and the people that might otherwise have to rescue him from himself).by the way - your artwork is childlike. stay home robert perkins.
4,Alan Bennett speaks to your head and heart...,"Alan Bennett, master of stage & screen (both big and small) and recently with WRITING HOME very entertaining on the printed page, has covered so much emotional ""turf"" in his writing that it is very impressive to see the plays collected side-by-side. By turns hilarious and heart-breaking (read: 40 Years On) one can only marvel at his talent, envy his breadth, and wait impatiently for the next project to be produced. Heartily recommended to all who care about the legitimate theatre."
4,Easy to Use,"It's very easy to use and clean -- don't really have to clean it...My girlfriend just LOVES it.It makes good coffee and the sound, while a little noisy, is not an issue for me as it brews fast.Would prefer to be able to buy packets from a store when running low but other than that, it's very good.Oh, and by the way. HAPPY ST. PADDY'S DAY!"
4,"Greatly convenient, priced right","If you're one of those people who'd like to have their morning coffee without having to clean up afterwards, this coffee station is for you. It's quick, easy to use, and brews fine quality coffee, at least according to my amateur taste. I'm less thrilled about its ability to brew high quality teas, though - I think brewing a nice cup of tea requires a bit more than 5 seconds of running hot water through the packet. Again, the same argument applies to coffee, but the 5 second trick seems to work there.The only suggestion I would have for Flavia is to allow for brewing larger volumes from one packet. The maximum settig the station has is 8 ounces, which looks more like 7. I have a 10 oz cup, and to fill it up I have to brew the same packet twice (once on a maximum setting and the second time on one of the minimum settings). Of course, the other alternative is to top off with hot water, but then I would also need to boil water separately for this purpose."
3,Flavia Fusion Drink Sattion,"Good product for a one cup coffee maker or dispenser. One only bad thing, is that you can only buy the coffee and tea from Flavia. It's either pay what they price or don't use the maker. It would be nice to have a price range from $10.00 to $50.00 but a case is around $45.00. The Flavia only has one type of design drink cartridge you can use on it."
4,Love the variety,I got this for Christmas and I love it! I am single and like variety of coffee including capuchinos and mocachinos. I can have my tea and my coffee without cleaning any mess in one cup.
2,"Good machine, Bad drinks","The Flavia fusion has a few things going for It; It's super clean, makes good froth and has many flavor choices. But for the life of me I can't find any that I like. The coffees and teas are week and very bitter. I have tried all the settings and all the flavors. It's too bad cause the machine is designed well. I also have a Tassimo machine, it makes MUCH better hot coco, coffees and teas (but offers too little variety). My kids won't even drink the coco out of the Flavia machine. So if you have one at your work and you like the taste, go for it! The home machine works well, but don't be dazzled by all the flavor choices, in my opinion none of them are very good."
5,Great Machine,"What a wonderful machine. Finally a machine that makes excellent drinks that is versatile, and easy to operate. The options are numerous and I could not be happier with the Flavia experience. I'm sold 100%"
5,My Hot Beverage System is GREAT!,"After reading a lot of reviews on various web sites about 3 different Hot Beverage Systems I decided on the Flavia Fusion and am I glad I did. It is so easy to use, no clean up and it makes a great cup of coffee, tea and hot chocolate. I also gave one to my parents for Christmas and they love their's so much they took it to their condo with them rather than being without it for 4 months. I got to see one of the other brands in action over the holidays at my brothers house and I sure am glad I decided on the Flavia after seeing the other one."
2,Try before you buy,"This is an expensive machine that locks you into an expensive proprietary cartridge system. There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee.That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces. Unless you're absolutely enthralled with the taste of Flavia coffee (or one of their other beverages) there are better, cheaper, less wasteful alternatives."
4,Braun (Tassimo) vs. Flavia SB100 coffee Systems?,"I am debating to buy between the Braun coffee systems which is using the Tassimo T-disc and the Flavia SB100. Does anyone knows which systems is better? I keep reading the T-disc is a problem to order, but how about the Braun coffee systems itself? I have not tried the coffee made by Braun, but the FLavia i have. IF you can, please comment. The Braun systems can be bought between $134-$169, the Flavia SB100 is for $199.FYI, on giantcoffee.com, they sell a box of Flavia coffee (100 bags) for only $32 (which is only .32 cents per bag) ..... AWESOME.The rating 4 star is only to get this commment in, not actual rating since i have not tried this particular model.PLEASE QUICKLY COMMENT."
1,What Wrong With You People???,"Am I the only one listening to this garbage? After I bought ""Salutations"", ""Drugs..."", and ""Space Age"" I thought I'd take a shot on this. No kidding there are no good songs on this. Everything is boring and there are no sweet riffs at all. I was waiting for a song to justify my purchase and it never came. I would have rated this 0 but... Wrapup: This album is a complete waste of time. Go listen to Space Age Playboys if you want to rock."
1,Disney screw it up again!,"He we go again, from Angels in the outfield having an anamorfic menu, and then poor non animorphic movie, they continue the stupidity. JUNGLE TO JUNGLE is a great family movie with no doubt wonderful wide views from the top of mountains and new york, so why not just put out yet another full screen version?The Disney DVD department contiue to screw things like this movie, the Three Musketeers and so many more....Get with the program Disney, wide screen is here to stay, animorphic is the only way to screen it, so for gods sake do it..DONT BUY THIS DVD>>>"
2,DISAPPOINTING!,This movie was very disappointing. I thought it would be fun because of Tim Allen but it wasn't. Skip this movie.
5,fun for the whole gang,"just a good clean family movie, full of laughs and yet has a pt to tell, we all enjoyed this movie and will watch it over and over"
5,"tim allen is very funny,",Tim allen is great in this movie and my review is to tell you that this will probally be the movie to keep. because tim and the twin towers are in this movie alot. hes actually worked in that tower in this movie. and this would be a classic for history and so on. that the world trade center is shown real good and that will miss it seen alot.
3,People-friendly movie,"Very funny and enjoyable movie for people of all ages. Sam Huntington is a name that rings a bell, but I can't seem to remember where he's from so I'll look him up on Search later. This movie kicks around a lot of jokes, over-accenting how weird Mimi Siku is in relation to the citizens of NYC but also including deeper issues on family, love, and learning to accept despite (or because of) our differences. Watch it asap."
5,A very cute movie with excellent acting!,"A great family movie!!! Lot's of fun filled excitement, fun for the whole family. I personally ""LOVE"" the actor Frankie who played as andrew, he's my favorite out of any in the whole world! A must see movie-you'll die laughing!"
3,Jungle2Jungle,have always enjoyed this movie very much and am happy to have it as one of my collection so the rest of my immediate and extended family can enjoy it whenever they have the opportunity of watching something from my collectionfrom phyllis
3,Ok,"This was kind of a dumb movie, ya know the first time you watch it you might like it but If you see it more than twice in a short period of time, its kinda pushin it, trust me!"
1,Horrendous! Why did Disney even make this?!,"First off, why is there a 2 in the title? This a remake, not a sequel. Seriously, why is this even a Disney film? It's not funny, and the content is certainly in appropriate for a ""family"" movie. There's discussion of the stock market, (Yeah, do you think that your kids are gonna be interested becoming stock brokers?), the Russian Mafia pops up, and some sexual innuendos, (""Nice poochie poochie. That's the LAST 'poochie poochie' you're ever gonna get!"") and even divorce problems. (Kids that are the product of a divorced household may have a hard time watching this.)In short, Jungle 2 Jungle is not a good flick, and MOST of the content in this Disney flick seem more appropriate for a PG-13 or an R-rated comedy drama film. Ignore this and watch some other Disney movie. A GOOD ONE!"
3,All right,"I cannot help but notice that in so many movies, Tom Allen does an okay job. He is funny in Home Improvement, but when it comes to movies, many of them aren't quite suited for him, and this is no exception. It is by no means an awful movie, but the storyline is rather predictable and you can pretty much guess what's going to happen within the first ten minutes of the movie."
2,VERY MINOR LISZT,"I must say I never heard of of Liszt's Dante Symphony even though I admire him and have owned at least one version of nearly all his works. It was therefore with great excitement that I listened to this ""discovery"" -- only to find out rather quickly why it is the most neglected Liszt work. I hate to say it but it is utterly boring, lacking any of the fire and rhythmic magnificence that characterize most of his compositions. I had to struggle mightily to get through the 50-odd minutes of tedium -- and to make sure it was not just my non-receptive mood, I listened again the next day. Unfortunately, the result was the same. 2 stars is charitable, and mostly to acknowledge the valiant effort of James Conlon and the Rotterdam Symmphony to breathe life into thismusical corpse."
4,Excruciating Pain,"Deathwatch is a mysterious book that takes place in the California desert. Ben and Madec are two men that go into the desert to look for bighorn, a kind of sheep. Ben is a college student and is guiding Madec through the desert because he needs money. Madec is a sly businessman. The only thing is that Madec kills more than a bighorn. He kills an innocent prospector, who was searching for gold. Will justice prevail? I liked this book because the author used foreshadowing and it was suspenseful."
4,A book that keeps you on the edge.,"Resist, and you die quickly. Comply, and you might live, in jail. Those were Ben's chioces in Deathwatch. In the Nevada desert with no water, food, shelter, or clothes is suicide, if you want to die. But a highway is only about sixty miles away. Do you fight your captor which has a small .22 and a .435 magnum rifle or do run for your life? Ben is followed by Madec, Ben's captor, as he searches for precious water. Deathwatch is an outstanding book. If you like adventure and twists around every corner, you will love Deathwatch. This book is action packed and it catches you in the first few pages. Although Deathwatch is a good book, I found some parts annoying. For example, Ben is hours away from dying from dehydration and he scales a cliff. But all in all, I think this a good book."
3,Boring,"This book had suspense, but it was still boring, it was really predictable at times, and a lot of it didn't add up, some things, especially descriptions were way off."
2,Deathwatch Review,"I did not think that Deathwatch was a very good book, because for most of the story all Ben (Main person) did was complain. The beginning and end was good but the middle was just a filler. It would have been a great book if the middle was more exciting. This book had a great beginning and ending. It is a hard book to say if i recommend it or not because it all depends on the type of books you like. I do not like any kind of fiction books."
3,Deathwatch.......an o.k. book,"Ben was a tour guide in the desert. Ben was trying to save up for collage. He meets a man that hunts and his name is Medic. Medic was trying to hunt for bighorns. The thing Medic tried to kill to kill the first time was not a bighorn.Ben gets robbed and is stranded in the desert with no water, food, clothes, or a jeep. Now he is being hunted by Medic. He found a sheriffs office and they don't believe his story. So then they finally believe him, so now they look for Medic. Finally they found him. Medic is in jail now.I give this book two thumbs up. I really suggest this book to the readers who don't know what to read. Once you read it you'll understand what I'm talking about. Maybe if you read it then you can get your friends to read it. I know I'm going to buy this book."
2,Its pretty good....,"This is DEFINETLY not the best book ever but i do have a little something for you. Read THE TRUE CONFESSIONS OF CHARLOTTE DOYLE,by avi, AMONG THE HIDDEN by margaret peterson haddix, and TAKEOFFS AND LANDINGS by margaret peterson haddix. THOSE are great books, BUT I WAS FPRCED TO READ THIS BOOK!!WARNING: THIS IS A GUYS BOOK! CHICA'S BEWARE!"
1,Not Appropriate for Children,"My teacher assigned this book in the 6th grade and we read it as a class. I can't think of a worse book to give to 11-year-olds. It's depraved and sadistic. It bothered me and haunted me for years, and I still think any middle school teacher who would assign this has seriously questionable judgment. The older I get the more I realize what a perverse assignment it was. There are plenty of other books that can teach ethics, if that's what it's trying to do, in a less sensationalistic and much more realistic, nuanced and interesting way. If I recommended this book to anyone, it would be to older teens or adults who like thrillers and pulp, or to people who like hunting. Literature it's not."
5,Great Book,"I read the book in high school and was impressed on how a simple vacation can go from good to bad in a matter of minutes. I am impressed on how a young man with no food, clothing, water or weapons can outsmart someone with a rifle and supplies to last out in the desert for days."
4,Grainy Detail,An impressive tale of the physical and mental struggle of a man at odds against two enemys: the desert and Madec: the man who is hunting him. A portrayal of hate and will to survive; this book accurately reveals the mental struggles that take place in both intense danger and everyday life. Deathwatch also paints this struggle with intense detail that is occasionally gruesome albiet extremelly interesting and thrilling. I savored it all. And enjoy it while it lasts. Some of the following reviews reveal too much about the story and ruined it for me. Watch Out.
3,Technically a hardcover book...,"I purchased this book because it's one of a few Robb White books I read as a child. It even had the same picture on the library book I read so long ago. When I received it I was a little bit disappointed that instead of a full size hardcover book printed on high quality paper, it looks like a paperback bound with a hard cover. It's the same size as a paperback, and the paper looks to be the same quality. I don't know if this information was included in the product description on Amazon, so I will state it here for others. It's not expensive but be aware that it's not a library quality full size hardcover book. Good adventure story for young readers though, as all Robb White books are. And if your young reader likes it, this one was made into a movie called Savages and features Andy Griffith, but unfortunately it's available only on VHS."
1,Horribly Boring and No Suspense,"The beginning was so-so, but in the middle hundred pages nothing happened, at all. There are a ton of loopholes in the plot, and the synopsis was just an excuse to have to guys duke it out in the desert."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!,"My God!!!! Where do I begin? This book had a seedy plot, horrible, stupid, imcompetent, characters, and no style at all! I had to read this year in English. It looked okay, but then I read it, and I had to restrain myself from throwing it straight into a trashcan. The ending was just plain awful. It was stupid!This guy is running around in the desert being chased by a psychopath with a rifle intent on killing him because this guy being chased saw the other dude kill someone with his rifle, of which you never find if it is intentional or not. The guy being chased is running around [...] naked in the scorching desert! Ewwww! How is that for being sick? Ughhh.If I could, I would give this book negitative infinity stars! Unfortunately, I can't, so I must contend with one star that it doesn't deserve. I was so disgusted with it a can't even explain. The ending I can't even guess what went on that man's mind to end it that way. So this book was horrible. That's all I have to say."
5,Deathwatch,This book is amazing but sometimes it can be a little dull. The story starts off with a bang the main character Ben is in the desert with trigger happy Madec hunting big horn sheep. Accidently Madec shoots a old a old man and Ben wants to tell it to the sherriff but Madec thinks otherwise since Madec has a wife and kids and doesnt want to go to jail. Then Madec starts hunting Ben and thus the chase starts.
3,Deathwatch,"Deathwatch is a book of high suspense. There's Madec, the sterotypical big city bad guy, who's life is full of lying, scams, and money. Then there's Ben who's your small town good guy. He's honest, loyal, and believes everyone is good. When Bed decides to be Madec's hunting guide in the desert, sparks fly between the two. Ben was born and raised in the desert and thinks he would never have a problem surviving. Well, he was wrong. Ben has to overcome many obstacles in this book; including finding food, water, shelter, and much, much more!This book is great for thrill seakers. It's fast moving, but like most books has some slow parts. It's a very descriptive book and at times it's too descriptive. The characters in the book come to life as this mystery unveils. The author contrasts the characters well, giving debth and showing many faces of the characters personalities."
4,This book is great to the end!,"This book is very suspenseful between chapters. Madec and Ben are two completely different characters, Ben is honest and good, whereas Madec is dishonest and bad. The author doesn't just say what is going on, he makes you feel what is going on. It's like he puts you in Ben's place, to feel what he is going through. I would recomend that if you like suspenseful, survival of the fittest kind of books, to read this book. It's a great book!"
4,"Deathwatch, another must read!","Ben, is a student who needs money to go to collage. He is hired by Madec, to guide him to the wild Big Horn. Ben does not like Madec but needs the money for school. After a few days of hunting they finally find a Big Horn. Madec aims, but before he can shoot Ben asks him if he has seen any horns. Madec says yes. He aims again and this time shoots. Something behind a cactus falls dead to the ground. Something that should never have been killed. Now Madec decides to play the game of death with Ben, only Ben is the only one who can die. Ben must find a way to escape being killed by Madec, starvation,dehydration, and the intense heat of the Arizona desert. This is one of the best books I have ever read! A cliffhanger until the last page!"
4,Good book,"The book death watch is about a guy named Ben, who helps a guy named Madec shoot a bighorn sheep. By accident, Madec shoots an old miner. Madec tried to persuade Ben not to tell the police, but Ben refused. So Madec made him take all of his clothes off, and give up all his supplies. Now Ben has to survive in the desert without essential supplies such as food, water, and clothes. This book is an exciting adventure story that keeps you thinking. This book will make you feel the emotions of the characters. We gave this book four and a half stars, because it was a good book, but you lose interest often.We suggest this book and hope you enjoy it."
5,good book (deathwatch),"I think Deathwatch by Robb White is the best book ever. If you like a book with lots of action and suspense then this is the book for you. In this book, Ben ,the main character, gets his life put on the line by a crazy lunatic named Maddec. He is pushed to the physical limit and is near death. But you will have to find out how and why by reading Deathwatch."
4,DEATHWATCH,"A man named Ben who needs a bit of extra money, so he hires himself out as a guide. He takes a hunter with an attitude to the desert to shoot some deer. While they are there things get so mixed up after they find a dead body.Ben soon finds himself the prey, running for his life, naked in the desert while his partner calmly tries to kill him in order to protect himself.Will Ben make it to civilization and clear his name?Will he end up dead in the desert as food for the scavengers?Read on to find out in this fast paced action driven novel.The action was quick and how it flowed without slowing down. The description this book was amazing. I could almost feel the desert heat and taste the sand. You will not be dissapointed at all."
3,Reads like an old black and white Perry Mason....,"but without the charismatic Perry Mason. I thought the summary blurb sounded intriguing, and as far as mystery set-ups go- a disappearing body and no trace of the murder venue- were quite good. However, the protagonists were a bit stiff, and they were not that well developed. The pay-off was a bit weak and sometimes it was hard to follow which characters were being discussed. The story had lots of potential but was ultimately just okay....."
3,"Whimsical, but Dated","Sort of what I guess would be called a ""whimsical"" murder mystery. Set in '30s Oxford, an eminent poet stumbles across a dead woman in a toyshop late at night, but is knocked unconscious. When he goes to the police the next day to report the murder, the body and toyshop are both missing! What follows is a somewhat interesting mystery with a vedy, vedy, dry British wit about it. I gather this is considered something of a classic, however it is so dated I doubt it will not survive my generation (I'm 28)."
2,Not his best plot by a long shot!,"The Moving Toyshop has been enshrined as Crispin's best detective novel, but it is not, in my opinion. The people who admire this book talk about the humor, but rarely about the plot. Yet Crispin, when he disciplined himself, had a first-class mind for puzzles. Unless you really enjoy English donnish humor, with lots of literary quotations, of course, I would advise you to avoid this one and seek out The Long Divorce or Love Lies Bleeding."
4,Lovely!,The plot is secondary to Crispin's beautiful use of the written word. This book is a fun book to read and invites expanding one's mind a bit.
1,Doesn't Play,"Waited a long time for the product. When it finally arrived, it would not play in any of three Bluray players. Returned it and replacement still would not play."
1,Too Many Defective Blu Ray Disks,"Like several other people I purchased this BluRay recording to be able to hear the performance offered in DTS HD. Hoever it will NOT play in any of three different Blu Ray Players (LG BD-390, LG BD-590, or Sony BDP-S570, all of which have DTS decoding built in. Neither would it play on three computer BD ROM's and writers. It would appear that ""Surround Records"" is having problems producing reliable Bly Ray disks. Stay away from this brand until they improve their product."
2,"Spare me Stokowski transcriptions, please","To be honest, I didn't buy this and have not heard it. I know I have heard the Stokowski version of Night on Bare Mountain, and was reminded of what Stravinsky said of Stoky's butchering of le Sacre du Printemps in Fantasia -- ""The performance was execrable.""I keep thinking that Disney needs to ditch the Stoky transcriptions (except for the Bach) and start all over with original Sacre excerpts and the Rimsky-Korsakov version of Night on Bald Mountain.Not that Stoky's conducting is always bad; his RCA recording from the early 70's of Rimsky-Korsakov's Russian Easter Overture is unbeatable, coupled with the flip-side reading of the eccentric but wonderful nonetheless Symphony No. 3 for Organ, Orchestra and 15 extra trumpets. You can only find this on out of print vinyl or reel to reel.Speaking of which, I wish the old labels like Sony and EMI would realize the potential for bluray audio only discs and start reissuing their older analog catalogs on these discs."
4,Interesting read,"I've read most of the Magic: the Gathering books, and this one is one of the more interesting and well-written one. The concepts in the book brings new light to the mechanism of Madness (cast something with less mana) and Nightmares (how dementia masters bring out perverted versions of creatures that are even stronger than the real ones). Since I play MtG, this is very interesting, and card for Chainer fits well with the powers in the story. However, I do have a gripe that the ending is too sloopy. When I finished the book, I get the feeling ""what? this is it?"". It's like the author reached the limit of his book and had to end it quickly. Other than this gripe, this book is the best among the Odyssey Cycle."
5,Pretty good sequal,"The book is about a man named Chainer who we met briefly in Odessy, this book goes over a bit of the history of the Mirari that everyone wanted in the first book(and still wants in this book), The Cabul that runs the pit fights, and the powers and way of becoming a dementia caster. The book is kind of slow in the beginning It goes through what happoned in Odessy only this time its from Chainers point of view. After that it gets more interesting as more people and groups fight for the Mirari and for control of everything from Otaria to the Mer Empire. Overall very good book with an ending that leaves you wanting the last book as soon as possible."
5,"good, but not brothers war","an awesome book, but im questioning whether is really good, or just good. Odyssey was, i hate to put it this way, but, garbage. I advise ANYONE to stay away from anything written by Vance Moore. i think what made torment seem so good, is that odyssey so bad. though the book was extremely good, emotional, the ending was nice too, i look foward to scott's next book for magic, he seems promising just by reading torment."
5,The BEST deep dish pan!,"This is a beautiful pan that justs makes you want to bake something in it. It is great for big portions, big families and holidays. Cleans up well, better than any other pan I've had."
4,A Pagan Must!,"This is a definate for any pagans collection. The drumming will get you dancing, the lyrics will make you think and with songs like ""Deity"" and ""Blessed Be"" your passion for the Craft will be aroused. There are two songs which I didn't much care for but rated with the rest of the cd they just didn't matter (That's what the skip button is for). If you like to be inspired then you have to have this one. LL&L"
3,"2 good songs, rest are ""downers""","This CD has two songs on it that make it a worthwile purchase: ""Circle Song"" and ""Pagan Zydeco."" The rest are all in the same, spooky-sounding minor keys that bring to mind haggard, wart-covered witches flying on brooms across the full moon - exactly the stereotype that practicing Wiccans and Pagans loath. Let's have some upbeat, happy, major-key songs that celebrate the joy found in paganism and nature religions."
4,keeping fit in your 50s,"Some times they talk too much, but it is a very good way to keep fit for people over 50. I like to do this and feel good afterwards."
4,Low Impact Exercises,"I really like the low impact moves. With back and neck injuries, I've got to be careful about floor exercises. I work up a sweat that makes the cardio workout worthwhile. And the exercises are easy to learn. Worth the money in my opinion. The only drawback is the repetition. The sets could be more varied. So if you're easily bored, this collection is not for you."
5,Keeping Fit in your 50's is fun,Love this set of exercise DVD's. Detailed execution of each exercise is very helpful. Received them quickly and for a great price.
2,got this for my mom,"The title says ""keeping fit"" which implies you already have been fit and are active. My mom is not a die hard, but does walk and uses a stationary bike now and then. She found this work out to be not very challenging at all... so I would recommend this only to someone who has been *sitting* for 50 years."
1,"Deceptive Title, This is Strictly for Beginners","I turned 50 a month ago, and have been an avid excerciser for over 15 years, either at home using videos, or at the gym. I purchased the entire collection, thinking that perhaps I might gain some insight or suggestions on improving or modifying my routines. These tapes are boring, repetative and frustrating. I'm thinking perhaps the music was added after each DVD was recorded, since I can't imagine anyone being as rhythmically challenged as these two seem to be. The word ""Keeping"" should be removed from the title, since if you are already fit, these workouts will not keep you there. Actually. there are many other instructors with workouts for beginners that would definitely motivate a person new to excercising to continue working out. It's a shame, actually, this collection seems to perpetuate the myth that people over 50 need to slow down....I disagree!"
3,keeping time,"I have been a life-long exerciser. Sometimes I stray and ignore exercising for a few months. When I am getting back in the groove I like to ease into it and I was looking for something that was real exercise but not quite the level of the Firm tapes that I usually follow. I thought I would try this one. It's okay however, the exercisers on the tape are completely asynchronis. They just can't keep a beat. They are not in time with the music, nor are they in time with each other. I find that to do this DVD, I either have to turn away from the screen or else perform the moves with my eyes closed. (which may just help my balance) If beat and coordination are important to you, this is not the tape for you. Otherwise, it's an okay, quick workout. (For quick, skip the intro and go directly to the workout.)"
4,Great for older adults to do at home,These DVDs provide an assortment of exercises for the older adult. Very little equipment is needed; directions are simple and easy to follow; nutritional and muscle information is given. This is an easy way to get all of your stretching and strength exercises done in the privacy of your home.
1,Keeping Fit in Your 50's,"Not real impressed. Too much talk, which granted is important for those who know nothing about exercise, but it takes me too long to skip over that part to get to the actual exercises. And they're not in time with the music, very frustrating to someone used to somewhat more rigorous workouts."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Having read the mixed reviews on this book, I was rather tentative to buy it but decided to give it a try because I really wanted closure to the characters having read the stories of the other Chisholm brothers. I actually found it quite enjoyable and don't understand some of the criticisms of other reviewers. I thought the characters had depth and were quite human in what they sought out of life and how they dealt with the challenges in their lives. I found the behind the scenes ""bachelor show"" comedy elements really funny."
4,good book,i have read many of kauffman's books and will continue to do so as long as she continues to write fun stuff like this
2,Too much internal debate,I hate to write a bad review but this book was so long when it didn't need to be. There were so many pages of internal debate and not enough dialogue between the characters. I loved the first three books of the series and this one was a dissapointment. I ended up skipping entire sections just to get to the dialogue and was still underwhelmed. I barely finished the book. I did love the main characters but I think the book could have been shorter and more to the point.
5,A very broad and powerful guide to health,"Peter Ragnar is a man to trust on any topic he discusses. Not only is the information on health well presented and proven (or at least given great evidence), but he is living proof that the teachings work! He explains his teachings very well and avoids making the book too scientific and detailed. The book may not contain everything about health, but the use of such information could easily cure 99% of the diseases out there! To read about it on his website, go to www.roaringlionpublishing.com"
4,The beginning of an era,"Unsane's debut album crushes everything in it's path. This band has went on to make some amazing albums! This one is no excpetion! Grinding, unforgiving, bluesy, noise rock!"
2,A disappointing follow-up,"Unlike the previous posts, I have nothing to say about how this was marketed -- which sounds awful. I bought the CD becase the real soundtrack to Garden State is one of my favorites. I assumed this came from the same folks and, like other soundtrack follow-ups, would probably have more music from the movie or would focus on the artists featured. Wrong. Doesn't look like this has anything to do with the movie, except two songs from musicians who are on the offical soundtrack (Frou Frou, Remy Zero). And ""Three Times a Lady"" from The Commodores?? How does that song belong here? If you really like the Garden State soundtrack and want more of it, this is probably not worth your time. Buy the artist's individual albums instead. Zero 7 is a great start."
5,Great review,"I agree that this book is an excellent review. You should probably take the class, but this book is very helpful with regards to the actual test. The Princeton Review's strategies (with the exception of skipping problems---don't ever do that) really work. I got a 5."
2,Princeton Review not very helpful,"The first thing that struck me about this publication was its attitude toward the AP test. In a nutshell, Magloire says ""The AP test is stupid and biology is stupid, but I guess I'll teach you about it. . ."" Not only that, but at least 30 to 40% of the material on the AP test was not in this book. The diagnostics in the back were the only helpful thing in this book, as they are real AP test questions, though they are not presented in a representative rastio to the real test. Need I say more?"
2,Vague...at best,"This book would be great as a skin-deep refresher for an already accomplished Biology student. Used as a test-prep guide...you got nothin'. This book won't help. Barron's Biology guide is longer and boring, but will get you ready to go for the big test."
4,DO judge this book by its cover!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this story of the plight and passion of a persecuted Jewish woman in 17th century Germany. The historical backdrop in the waning years of the Inquisition provides a fascinating context. It is superbly written and has it all . . . tragedy, lust, betrayal, love and justice. It's historical fiction at its best, and, is right up there with Follett's ""Pillars of the Earth"" in my opinion. It's a truly a superb tale with just the right touches of supernatural evil and erotica."
1,BLEAH-- absolutely awful!,"Sheesh! How do books this bad get published, much less wind up with rapturous comments on the covers? The writing is TERRIBLE: wooden, inexpressive, full of cliches and boring, boring BORING! All the steamy sex in the world becomes ludicrous when it's presented to the reader in such uniformly awful writing. I almost never fail to complete a book, even one I don't particularly like, so I struggled through most of this book, but I just couldn't finish it.Somebody who actually knows how to write should take on this potentially interesting subject."
2,Lost interest,"I lost interest about half-way though the book. The idea overall is interesting. But, there were too many things in the story that were tedious."
4,"C'mon people, this book isn't that bad","I liked this book. Certainly thought it was interesting. Kept me going. . . It had a lot of magical realism, but I really liked it. Da Vinci Code was worse. >:D"
2,"Good History, Bad Story","My cousin and I bought the last two copies at a local bookstore, hoping for what was detailed on the jacket. It was a great disappointment. I feel that I learned a bit about some of the history of that time--but this really was not a well-written story."
4,Interesting Read,"Despite what others say about the book, I loved it. I thought that it was well written and in a unique way that made it interesting.The ending was rather sad, it was not what I had expected to happen...which was good I suppose in that it was a surprise!I would recommend the book to others to read."
2,What's with the cover???,"I should have known by the cover that this book was alittle over the top. Everyone who saw me reading it was also slightly disturbed and had lots of questions. I enjoyed the historical aspect of the book and being an OB/GYN nurse, the midwifery parts, too. The details of the torture scenes and the sadistic personality of the Inquisitor were too graphic and upsetting to me to allow me to relax and enjoy the story. I've already sold it back to the used bookstore that I purchased it from."
1,I so wanted to like this book...,"... but I simply can't get past the writing style. I've never been able to engage in a story when it is written like a stage direction. (ie. ""She pulls a loaf of challah from under her cloak and a small sealed bowl of harissa, a savory wheat and meat porridge enriched with melted fat and cinnamon. Ruth falls on the food and Rosa, stroking her matted hair watches her eat.""It doesn't allow the reader to sympathize with the characters at all. You get no real sense of their emotions by watching from a distance unless there are actors portraying the characters in a movie where you can get the visual sense by their expressions.I found my self attempting to translate the directorial style in my head to something more readable and, sadly, that spoiled the whole experience for me."
2,Anachronistic disappointment,"Even with deletion of the erotica (which adds nothing to the plot and makes the book unsuitable for the teens in my house), and toning down the torture scenes, this would not be good book club material. Some of the characters and pieces of the plot were sufficiently interesting to lead me to read to the end, but I wish someone else had written this book."
3,Too complex.,"Set in the seventeenth century, Ruth bas Elazer Saul is called the witch from Deutz. She is also the best midwife in the Rhineland. Ruth believes in Science and has studied the sacred text of Kabbalah, which women are banned from doing.The Inquisitor, Carlos Vicente Solitario, charges Ruth with heresy. But Detlef von Tennen believes that those false charges are not the real reason Ruth is in such danger. Since Detlef is canon, and the cousin of the Archbishop, he joins the investigation.*** The plot and cast of character in this novel are too complex for me to write a thorough synopsis. If you do not already know something about seventeenth century history, you may very well find yourself lost and bewildered. ***Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."
3,...disappointed...,"I ordered this book after reading ""Soul"", which was absolutely terrific. I was disappointed in The Witch of Cologne. It starts very slowly and I had to often reference the list of characters (provided at the beginning of the book) to try to keep the plot straight. The author did do a lot of research, which I appreciate. However, the first third of the book was actually boring to me, even though I am a devotee of history and detail. Had I not loved ""Soul"" so much, I would not have bothered to drag myself through ""The Witch..."". Things did pick up further into the story and the last half of the book was more interesting and readable. Overall, however, I was disappointed."
3,"Good, but fell apart","The book had great quotations, and was inspirational, but the pages started coming apart after I began writing. I do not want to discourage people from buying it, because it may help them, but for me, it didn't work that well, because I had pages here and there, after I started using it."
2,"Yuck, variety lacking","I bought this to try out some new teas and see if there was something I should be picking up locally. It was a pretty big waste, as most of the teas taste similar and are not very good to begin with. I'd recommend you find a different brand, or possibly find a local shop that can help you find teas that you'd enjoy."
2,"Bland teas, cool packaging","I liked the packaging style of the tea, but I was given the Black tea sampler, the green tea sampler, and the white tea sampler, and all 3 boxes teas tasted pretty much the same. All the black teas taste like all the other black teas, and so on. Aside from the green earl grey tea, and the green genmai,{which were both EXCELLENT} they were very bland."
3,Tea Is Interesting,"This assortment of Adagio teas is interesting. I am fond of the Ceylonese bands and black teas. The others were not good; I discarded them after one cup. This is loose tea, by-the-way, in case someone thought they were bagged teas."
4,A Great Guitar for a beginner or for a Pro,"Dean Hardtails are made with exceptional quality and the highest of craftsmanship. It has a fast neck, and excellent action. Plays equally well for Hard Rock and Roll to Blues. It also has one of the best sounds when using a slide. A Guitar I would reccomend to anyone looking to buy a new guitar."
5,Simply the best!,"I just want everyone to know this book is awesome! Not your typical debut book at all. This writer knows how to hook the reader from page one. I read it in one sitting because I simply could not put it down. The characters were so well developed, I felt as if I knew them personally. Kudos to Ms. Scott for an amazing story! I can't wait for the next one."
4,True Soul - Not New Soul,"From the blog [...]:Want some new music that's not filled with ""B*&%$ and H@$""? You've got to check this young man out! Ryan Shaw is a 26 year old from Decatur, GA that will take you back to the days of sweet soul music with Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and Sam Cooke. Great voice and slammin' retro tunes. I'm hoping he gets the air play he deserves on the so-called 'urban' stations.The cd is a stable, midranger - a few new tunes by the artist, familiar standby's from Bobby Womack and Otis Redding. Right now I'm listening to Nobody, It's Over, and We Got Love. Sweet. Check him out, he's touring this summer with Joss Stone.Now when you've finished checking this out, go tell yo' momma AND your daughter!"
2,It works--barely,"I bought this figuring that a cheap s-video cable is all I needed and under the assumption that the cable sold by MS couldn't be that good anyway. Well, I cannot speak for the Microsoft cable yet, but I will end up buying it, as this cable is functional but not that good.What do I mean, well there is moire--lots of moire, anywhere it could exist it does. I didn't even realize that it could be that bad. It is distracting, even on the dashboard. In addition, there is a lot of dot crawl. It makes everything, games, videos, dvds, etc look rather bad. To be honest both issues make the composite signal (on the component adapter that came 360) seem quite a bit better. I guess I got what I paid for. At least the audio seems OK. I'd avoid this if you can."
2,Too small for use as a soup/stew bowl,Bowls are expensive and look nice - they would be fine for cereal or a side salad. They do not hold enough (fewer ounces than claimed) for soup or stew. Plus when you put soup in a bowl - you need a little space at the top so that soup isn't overflowing.Keep shopping.
2,Belson Wax Warmer,This little pot I thought would be perfect for my at home spa. It accommodates a small jar of wax. Heats up quick!The only problem is I only got to use it ONCE before the switch broke:(. Other than that it is okay.
1,Outdated Book,"The lack of a paragraph stating it's contents is your first clue. The second is looking at the cover, enlarged, you see it covers NT 4. Those tests are not given any more. Wait until Dummies puts out one that covers Wondows 2000."
4,"A little less humor, a little more romance.","After reading the first volume of ""The Wallflower"", I had high hopes for the second installment of the series. Though I can't say I didn't like the book, it definitely pales in comparison to the debut volume.Sunako falls slightly out of character at minor points in the story, Kyohei's actions seem a little random and overall the humor is a little less intense as from the first volume. Also, there is a lot less material this time. The actual manga part of the book is a lot shorter than last time's; however, instead of just a pointless laugh-out-loud book, it brings to the table a bit of suspense this time around. There also appears to be a lot more suggestiveness and introduction to possible romances in this volume.I would recommend this manga series as a whole rather than this particular volume alone, and if you really just want to try this series out and not commit to reading the entire thing, I'd suggest going for volume 1 instead."
3,"a ""OK"" book","Network Security Technologies is a good book for beginners who want to quick understanding of network security concepts, its classifications and its use in creation of integrated technologies. But this book is not for people who are looking for a ""Complete Network Security Guide"".The text does a good job of giving a nice introduction in the first two chapters. But the depth of discussion decreases from the 3rd to 6th chapter. The author did discuss the Enhanced and Integrated Technologies nicely. But in many places, the author makes uses of technology abbreviation without give a explanation what they stand for. The author did a good job of providing table of technologies and NSA and SNAC security configuration guide in the Appendix.Overall its an average book"
5,Best comprehensive starter book on Homeopathy,I found this really a great comprehensive beginner's introduction to Homeopathy. It reads very well and maintains the readers interest. I highly recommend this book if you are new to Homeopathy and are interested in learning about it.
2,Unhelpful advice,"I did not find this book helpful at all. In fact, I felt it made me more guarded and confused as to the ""proper"" way to conduct myself. I was afraid to speak. From ""timeouts"" to the meditations and visualizations to heal yourself, it left me cold. To read that you need to see it from his side and the anger he must feel makes you furious. His anger and pain is nothing compared to the person that has been betrayed."
5,Cozy,"The soft, simple city and country illustrations and the gentle rhythms and add-on patterns of the reassuring text make this warm and loving bedtime story a good choice for early readers and pre-readers alike. Since my toddler was 18 months old, this has been one of our favorites. We have fun adding our own animal sounds to the chain of events, and, of course our own nighttime snuggles and stuffed-animal cuddles at the end."
5,Good buy,"I just received this cable today. I Like the way it is packed. Sealed in a large Ziplock. I tested it and no problem at all.I did what it supposed to do, connect my SM58 to my mixer without any hum or annoying sounds. Would recommend this product to others."
1,Lots of static,"I purchased a 50 ft cable from guitar center for a performance we were having at our yoga studio... the cheapest cables were pricey so I came home and figured i'd look on amazon and order next day if there was a big price difference. These cables were less than half the price (including one day shipping). Awesome, right? No... we plugged in the cable to mike and the mixer and got lots of static. Swapped it out for the one I got from guitar center and the static was gone. These cables did not work for us. Maybe it was just a bad cable... but not worth the hassle for me. I would not recomment these. BTW... the cable/jacket was a lot thinner than the ones from guitar center. Not sure if they are well shielded and that was what caused the static."
5,Steinski at his best,"This album features Steinski and his mixing skills. If you liked Lessons 1 and 2 featuring Steinski and Double Dee, you will love this album. It's one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through. The songs and samples that he uses really lets you know the caliber of the talent of Steinski. If you like hip hop and funk this is a great mix."
5,No need to miss Franklin,Si happy to have found Franklin on dvd to share with grandkids. Such a cute series and was glad to have it shipped to me promptly and safely.
2,needs a rewrite,"If there is a blizzard outside and you are completely shut off from the rest of the world, the cable is out and you're totally desperate from boredomm, maybe.....otherwise skip it. I trudged through this story, and it was a hard thing to do. The ending was empty."
1,A Great Sucking Sound Commenceth,"Don't read this book! It says on the front cover that it won some award for paranormal romances, so if this is the best I pity anyone who has to read the worst. The characters are cardboard, the sex scenes are as predictable as you can get, the storyline is confusing and hard to follow as it jumps back and forth between the future and the past as people from the future try to go into the past to stop their future from occurring. Did it occur to anyone with the tiniest education in physics that if the people in the future change the past, then their future will not exist and they will not have changed the past after all? Paradox anyone? I sludged my way through nearly half of this pile of rotten cheese before I gave up and threw it across the room. I will only repeat again, do NOT read this awful book!"
1,Great game.... if you speak Japanese,"OK... I'm just a mom, but I figured ""world wide"" edition would mean that people all over the world would be able to play it. But since my ten year old doesn't speak or read Japanese, he was disappointed. A lesson learned for me, I guess."
5,"An excellent guide for 12 Step prayer, meditation, reading, guidance","A Key Work on Morning Meditation and PrayerEarly on, Dick B. discovered that there were plenty of meditation and prayer books, but practically none that showed what early AAs were doing with their Quiet Times. This is an excellent help to me in following the sequence of 'meditation' events: a new birth, Bible study, prayer, seeking God's guidance, studying a devotional like The Upper Room, The Runner's Bible, and My Utmost for His Highest. It's actually a guide in my own daily prayer life, and can be for anyone who wants to be in touch with God each day - just as AA pioneers wereAlso recommended: The Akron Genesis of Alcoholics Anonymous by Dick B. New Light on Alcoholism by Dick B. That Amazing Grace by Dick B."
2,Ouch!,"I should've read the product description a little more closely. These condoms are intentionally twisted. I put them on my junk, then tried to twist it back...needless to say, everything ended up in knots.All you non-magnum wearers wouldn't know anything about getting it tied up in knots."
5,Dr Jones and Carolyn is WONDERFUL,I love the stories and the format. My granddaughters and I have been lying outside in our hammock and taking turns reading aloud the introductory story and the dialogue. I think the stories are both engaging and humorous....a very difficult combination to find!
5,Most Humorous Book for Kids and Adults,"This book kept me in stitches! I bought it for my kids because it is an educational book with comprehension exercises. However, the book is so funny that my husband and I liked the book for ourselves!"
1,Half truth,"Be weary of half-truths and whole lies. If what you read isn't 100% in the Bible, it is false.2 Corinthians 5:10For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.'...OR BAD.'!It's funny how this book forgets to mention that we WILL stand before God and answer for our sins. Christ died so that we could have a chance to go to Heaven. It does not guarantee that we will end up there. We have to live a holy life. And if we don't, we will answer for it.This book is not accurate when compared to scriptures. If you want to know what Heaven is going to be like, read Revelation. It's in there. God has revealed to us through His word what He wants us to know. We should be satisfied with that and not look to books like these to tell us what we want to hear. Because they aren't always true. And if it's not true, then why do we waste our time?"
3,"Jargon-choked, but at times insightful.","This is an unabashedly academic book, and it certainly provides some ammunition for people wishing to play Sokal for a day and make banal snipes at the Humanities. But it also contains some genuine insights about the way our psychological need to keep and uncover secrets has influenced the course of the last century. People looking for a perfectly accurate description of how encryption works should look elsewhere. People looking for an intriguing discussion about *why* people want so badly to encrypt and decrypt things have pretty much nowhere else to look; this is one of the only books I've found on the topic. It's a relatively strong start in an engaging direction of study. Fans of Poe, especially, are likely to find something of value tucked away in this piece of scholarship, though it is at times unnecessarily dense."
3,A good book featuring a timeless author,"Elizabeth Stevens......the word ""college"" is spelled with two L's. A ""genius"" would surely know that. By the way, the book isn't half bad either."
3,It covers everything but a little hard to understand without a teacher/tutor.,"It talks about everything, but a little hard to understand since its not clear.But I have a great tutor so its made up for!"
3,Algebra 1 McDougal Littell,"The book was in good shape. However, I somehow overlooked that the the book was a teaching book from Kentucky. When I contacted the seller she was very willing to exchange the book for the correct one or give me a refund."
1,a School textbook,"This is truly a school textbook. It is meant to compliment a professional teacher's classroom, not homeschool friendly. In fact, it just frustrated my poor son and the online practices were even worse. I wouldn't recommend this for homeschool. A neighbor let me borrow her Saxon Homeschool kit and that brought light back into my son's desire to learn, again."
2,Too full of waffle,"1020 pages for a 1 year introductory algebra 1 course? Outrageous and with a price to match. The ""friendly"" marginal notes and ""interesting"" boxes make the book slow to navigate. It almost assumes that the student does not have access to a teacher who knows what he is talking about and that they are willing to devote 100% of their time to wading through this vast tome.A decent teacher - public, private or home school - and a Cliffs Notes would be a better option than this paperweight."
1,too many editions,"It is very frustrating to try and find the correct version of this textbook. We live in Maryland, and there is a ""Maryland version"" that I have not been able to locate.1-seriously, each state has a different version- with the same cover?2-Isn't Algebra, Algebra? how many updates do you need for Algebra?3-What a racket- that a math book costs over $70.I returned this book and thankfully got a refund. What a hassle."
4,Doubble Shotguns Most Dedicated Advocate --- tells all,"McIntosh clearly has a wealth of experince and love of the subject that he writes on. His concise, incisive and comprehensive reviews are refreshing at a time when so many writers just ""cover the material"". This is a review of over 30 of the most frequently encountered side-by-side shotguns manufactured in the 20th century. I enjoyed reading the text for the following reasons: a) I am looking to buy a side-by-side and need objective comparative information -- this the text has. b) I enjoy learning about the sport of wing shooting and the text is full of history, technical and practical insights. c) The author is candid about his preferences ---- the right trigger pull etc and what his expectations are for each category of gun. I read the book in one sitting ------ it was worth the time.GTO"
4,Excellent.,See in particular 1. Arieta 2. AYA 3. Beretta 687 EELL 4. ASE 90 5. Ugartechea 6. Marocchi. It would be a serious absence should i have missed it.
1,take it for what its worth,"The commentary is based on author's bias opinion, the playwright obviously is not a gunsmith nor a metal / mechanical expert, a lot of fancy words and elegant phrase are used to portrayal the guns which he knew nothing about.....take it for what its worth."
4,Good Budget Cartridge,"I have never owned or really considered buying an Audio-technica cartridge, but I needed an inexpensive cartridge for an old Technics SL-6 turntable that I was fixing. I checked the cost of a replacement Technics stylus it was more than the cost of this AT 90C. It was easy to install. The sound quality is very acceptable. I have the turntable connected to a little Behringer phono preamp connected to a K8G tube amp that has a Haller Passive Preamp Circuit. This cartridge has good output and is easy to listen to. It comes with complete hardware including a standard half inch mount for a conventional head-shell."
4,For $20?,Are you kidding me? This is a great unit for the price. I am using it in the mount to replace the stock one on my CD2LP. Set up was easy and the sound is fine. Makes great sounding CDs and MP3s for me.
3,Adequate replacement,"Used to replace a worn cartridge. It works and I really have no complaints, but I really don't notice a difference between the new cartridge and the five year old cartridge that it replaced."
1,defective,"i recieved the cartridge quickly and packaged good,, the item was in new package, i opened it up to install, the needle was defective,crooked,, possibly manufactured the wrong way and would not play properly,"
2,Clear Case of Damage,"Nice to look at but the clear plastic cover makes it difficult to use the stylus. One has to press hard. Which may have caused a bigger problem. My Treo 600 developed a white spot in the middle of the screen. Service center technician said that there have been a number of units with the same problem. They could not explain why this happens but it seems that most users/owners with this problem were using this kind of form fit case. Maybe, pressing hard on the screen caused it. Or the clear plastic front sticking on the screen causes the problem. Good thing, the warranty on my unit was OK and the screen was replaced. Praises for the quick action. But I bought another case, this time without the clear plastic."
2,Not recommended...,"Although this product did not cause damage to my Treo as other reviewers have noted, I can certainly vouch for its shortcomings. The plastic screen cover sits a fraction of an inch above the Treo screen, rendering the stylus virtually useless and even if you are lucky enough to get it to work, you literally poke holes in the plastic cover with the tip of the stylus because you must press so hard. The holder often popped out of it's clip when I would kneel or bend. This lead to many near-death experiences for my Treo. Although I must note that the Leather is of very high quality and actually has a cushioning effect when the Treo falls. This holder's snap closing frequently popped out my SD memory card since the strap lies perpendicular across the top of the phone right on top of the SD slot. I gave up on this holder after two months and got the stationary side clip holder which is working out a bit better, albeit with a few notable annoyances itself."
2,Deesn't work as expected,"WHen trying to use the phone feature you can not hear. The hole in the case does not match up with the Treo. This was a second one, assuming the first had to be defective, but it was the same. I have to remove the phone to answer it. The only purpose it serves is as a belt clip."
1,Plastic cover is a barrier to your data and fuctionality of treo,"THe case is nice, but it is not fuctional. The plastic cover creates a barrier to your data that does not need to be there. The only thing this case is good for is keeping the phone on your belt buckle. The case is so bad I have thought about cutting a piece of the cover out to make this more fuctional."
5,Best should make more. super editions,This is such a good book. You learn a lot about Gaia's child past. And during this whole time she is trying to find things out. So in other words you know things she doesn't. During this Tom's twin bro comes up Gaia's mom and this weir dguy and about a few more you will have to find out about when you Read it.
5,Before Gaia - a must read!,"'Before Gaia' is probably the best book of the Fearless series I have read. The whole book is so gripping that it is difficult to put down. The book provides the reader with lots of answers about Loki, and what has made him the way he is. If anything, I felt some sympathy towards him. But besides that, Francine Pascal creates a beautiful story in this book. I especially loved the part when little Gaia is introduced into the book. The incidents that are described with her are very cute. For any Fearless fanatic...this is a must read!"
3,Nicely done,"Life Inside the Military Academy (Insider's Look) by Aileen Weintraub gives readers a sense of what it's like to live and be educated at one of the most prestigious and famous academies, West Point. Using clear, concise language, Ms. Weintraub takes readers inside West Point and shows how a cadet's life begins at dawn and ends after an intense day of studying and training. Also of note, is the age appropriate language the author uses to engage young readers. A cadet's time is also broken down year by year, thereby showing readers what cadets are expected to have learned and implemented as time goes on. Further, the book includes a brief section on what life is like for cadets after West Point, which can be eye-opening at times. Overall, Weintraub does a nice job of making readers feel as though they haveindeed gotten an inside look at life at West Point."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TONER!!!!,"The seller with this product picture tries to make you think you are getting an HP product!! YOU ARE NOT! It is some 'Replica' toner and on top of that.. NOT compatible.. My printer asked me to take the toner OUT! LOL Telling me this is not a HP Original product! The reason I did not return.. (WHICH I SHOULD HAVE) The day I received the toner I had a few big print projects that ""Had to get DONE"", So I just went on with the toners hoping they will work.. Well Yes, they worked, But after about 800 pages the printer asked to replace toner. SO as my title suggests... ""DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"""
1,This edition is now obsolete,"On April 28, 2005, Sony Online Entertainment released a massive revamp of ""Star Wars: Galaxies."" The whole combat system is different, as are the in-game professions and creatures. This edition of the game guide is now completely obsolete."
1,Useless now...,"Sad to say, this guide is useless. The game, as many other have stated, has undergone many changes and even the Jump to Lightspeed side is now out of date.IF the book was $1 it'll be a nice addition to a collection, but being a guide to SWG? Not at all. :("
1,burn your money instead,"this is such a waste....heck, just send me your money and i'll burn it for you....bumm deal!"
3,decent,"Even though it is very well illustrated.it is very simplistic and leaves much to be desired.the basics of color section was the most insightfull part of the book.the techniques are ok,but only.A notch above that insider trading ex-con's TV show."
5,Excellent Book an Excellent service,this book arrived in wonderful condition in the specified days.It has proved to have all the receipes I required an more.
2,I wish this book had more practical recipes,"Although I liked the general layout of this book, it fell short in providing actual how-to recipes. I have had this problem with many books on the subject of faux painting. I finally did a little research on the Internet and came across Sandra's Recipe Cards - 20 unique faux finish designs with how-to, step by step instructions on the back. Faux Like a Pro publishes these cards and they can be found online at www.fauxlikeapro.com."
2,ok,"I borrowed this from the library and found that most of the effects looked extremely tacky. Maybe they look good with certain decors, but there are no images of completed rooms! Glad I checked it out at the library first."
3,Fur Real animals,"My daughter was tickled pink when she got it - we have several of these toys - but usually they just sit there. I personally find that any ""non-animated"" stuffed toy does the trick. In itself I think the Fur Real friends are funny."
1,Not for a Chevrolet Blazer 2001,If you're buying this for a Chevrolet Blazer 4 doors 2001 LTS this one NOT FIT... they are too short to full open the glass door. Look for another option unless you want about 50% of the original opening space.
4,A useful and provocative guide,"Jonathan Bellman has collected an interesting set of essays on the ""exotic"" in Western art music. One of the first points made is that what is perceived as exotic by modern Western concertgoers not only means so-called foreign evocations, such as Hungarian, Spanish, Middle Eastern and Far Eastern music, but also encompasses such areas as jazz and Native American music. There are nods to the growing area of gender studies as they relate to music, such as in the opening essay, on ""The Exotic, the Erotic, and the Feminine."" In such a collection, naturally the individual chapters vary in clarity of writing style and quality of ideas, but overall this is an impressively written and consistently interesting set of essays."
2,shoe princess,I love this brand and have a beautiful pair of Italian shoes but found these to run small and actually found them cheaper in Ross Dept Store $19.99 so no bargain here.
5,Here Comes Halloween...,Have always enjoyed reading books from Caroline Jayne Church. We have purchased many books from this author and would definetly recommend. This book is a great addition to our collection. Especially for the Halloween Holiday!!!
5,SO CUTE!,"I think this is a very great toy.It plays great with my ipod video.I always have to close the door when i play with it because it scares my dogs',but they've got used to it.This is a great buy for a great toy.The batteries do take a little while to put in ,but besides that its great!"
5,I-Dog,"This is such a cool item for kids who love music and have and Ipod. I purchased this for the boy I nanny for and he loves it. He carries it around with him. He loves dogs so this was perfect. It's cute. The dog does not like his tail pulled though, it's so cute. You interact with the dog to see what kind of music he likes the best that you play through him."
4,Just too danged cute!,"Got this little guy from Woot as a Christmas gift for my daughter and I think we've all just fallen in love with him. His lights, personality, his dancing, what's not to love! Only complaint is that sometimes it's hard to get him to dance using the lights on his face, but nothing insurmountable!Go iDog, GO!! :)"
3,Cute but pricey.,"I really have to say that the price for this seems a little high for what little it does. I thought it would have a little more movement (dancing) than it does. Ours just turns his head slowly to the music every now and then. I was kind of expecting more head, ear and tail movement, but sadly no. I give the speaker a 5 out of a possible 10, it just sounds strange."
4,it's pretty cool...,"its a great speaker, its loud enough for me. i like playing my music on it and watching it rock out a little. its cute and i dressed it in adorable clothes, green. at first i couldn't figure out why music wasn't playing from the speaker... i should've remembered to turn up my ipod LOL. i like it"
